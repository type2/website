Hi Jdd,
Early in 1964 model year.

They were the same.  Due to DPOs of the tranny any gearing could be in there. 
 When we got our 1960 panel camper it came with a small nut tranny that RPMed 
out at 3,000 RPM (-at-) 35 MPH in fourth gear.  No wonder the DP engine that came 
with the bus in the cargo compartment had a hole through the top of the 
engine case from a thrown rod at probably 5,500 RPM at 55 MPH!    Eric&Barb
