I've really been having a tough time starting my bus these days.  I just =
keep turning it over again, and again and again and again and again and =
eventually it starts.  I set the points, the timing, etc.. it just takes =
a long time to get it running?  I drove my bus last winter on occasion =
and it wasn't near this tough to get started and it was much colder than =
these last couple of days.  Once it's running and warm it will restart =
ok but it's that initial started that's a b*tch. I'm running 20-50 oil =
and I'm thinking about going to 5 - 30 for the winter (not that I'll =
drive my bus much anyway in the winter).  I wonder if that will help?

Ideas appreciated.
