Subject: Re: [VB] New Microbus with some old VW perspective

I read an article yesterday in the local paper about future plans of VW in regards to the Micro.
They picked Hanover plant for the new home of the "New Bus". I suspect that it will get as much
attention as the "New Bug" got when it first came out. Now I'm thinking.... is VW just trying to win
customers over "vintage stuff"? Jetta, Golf and Passat are not enough? That will probably effect
"Vintage Bus" market - in a bad way - there might be a surge in prices and you'll see all kinds of
people buying Buses. And since a lot of people here felt very dissatisfied with the design of the
new Bus will there be any interest at all? Who in general would be most likely to buy the "New Bus"?
(Not me - I think at least for now) (My daughter has one of these already - or her Barbie, that is.)

peace,

| This is in interesting article since it has an older bus perspective
