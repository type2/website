 Try dropping an intake manifold from 10 feet up on a piece of tempered 
glass. -- The intake will bounce off.   I think the impact of a head on 
tempered could be a bit  painful.  
  Ya, it's easy to crack laminated glass, that's why it's US spec for 
windsheilds.   The OEM safaris in my 61 have uncracked laminated glass. 
  Isn't it a frame construction issue?   They say CE frames are better made, 
so maybe it'd be okay.  I saw a non-CE repro safari crack in a friend's bus 
when he drove on a badly rutted  driveway.  He had just put them in the week 
before.

<< C E Safaris use tempered not laminated. When I talked to Dave (C E owner)
 he says the tempered will not crack like the laminated do. Tempered glass
 can flex more then laminated. Most (all) safaris that use laminated seem to
 crack long before the tempered. Many people are parnoid of the tempered
 becase they shatter instead of cracking. When I was on a OZ site they
 explained how they still use tempered instead of laminated because you have
 less chance of injury when you fly threw a tempered windshield verses the
 laminated one that doesn't shatter.
