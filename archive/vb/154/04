Subject: New Microbus with some old VW perspective

http://money.cnn.com/2002/08/23/pf/autos/microbus/index.htm

This is in interesting article since it has an older bus perspective
included, not your everyday new whiz-bang car article.

... I feel very sorry for the poor 21 window that they killed!  

Still too much H2O for me.  The author has a good point about the round
headlights though.


Enjoy,
