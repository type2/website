Subject: re:was checking reduction box

the wheels should titlt in when you lift the bus due to the way that the
suspension works. as for the puddle in the middle...i am not sure. is it
transmission/gear oil or motor oil. transmissiom/gear oil has a really
strong smell, as opposed to motor oil which doesn't smell too strongly.
