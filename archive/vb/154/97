Subject: Engine rebuilders that cc heads-Als engine battle continues.

This guy is arguing that checking head cc and deckheights are ONLY part
of a HIPO motor build, and not a stock engine build whatsever, and
therfore he is clear of any liability for my situation. He challenges me
to come up with a name of a VW motor shop that ccs a stock 1500-1600
engine rebuild (I guess it's fair to make two assumption scenarios,
using used heads, and new ones, if that would make a difference. So a
question to the more knowledgeable and experienced while I continue to
attmept to get money or new heads from this guy, I am wrong?
... I guess 1700.00 is just enough to buy complete crap? I would have
paid more for what I wanted....Only chose the guy because it was in
driving distance thought locality would matter...Big mistake.
Al
I just want a motor that runs, and requires scheduled maint....uhhhhg.
