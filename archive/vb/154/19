It sounds like you have bug tires.  That probably means bug rims.  165s
might fit but real bus tires I think will hit in the back as the offset is
different on bus rims.  Especially with adaptors.  You can get some good
strong tires for the 14" bus rims.  195s work well.
The 165 tires are usually pretty weak for a bus, but I've seen lots of
people use them.
