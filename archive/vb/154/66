Subject: shift rod bushing

I should be getting a new shift rod bushing kit tomorrow...any suggestions
on replacement...things to do at the same time. The bushing right underneath
the shifter sheared. i noticed this during a routine inspection recently.

I also need to replace the brake return spring, a local supplier i recently
found does not have this...hopefully someone else does...

thanks
