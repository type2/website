Hi Cal,
You really should not check the RGBs for fullness this way.  The tranny 
center section is higher than these in stock buses and at least 1/3 of the 
fluid in the tranny is higher than the lowest part of the axle tubes.  This 
means if you have a RBG leak the tranny gear oil flows downhill from the 
tranny center section through the axle tube to the RGBs to keep them full.  
So all one has to do is insure the center section if full!!!
