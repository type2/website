Volks,

I am at a point now to where I have to make a decision as to my tires
and wheels.  I have full sets of both 15 and 14, and tires for each. The
problem is that the 14 inch wheels I have need some work,...paint, etc. 
My 15 inch wheels are nice chrome and mag wheels, with a painted center
that I can easily paint black . . . hey, I am from the 60's, remember? 
My tires are in good shape, they are 165R1586s, good, excellent rubber. 


The only problem with the 15 inch wheels is that they are4 lug, so I'd
need a set of adaptors.  Question, will the adaptors allw this size tire
to still clear the rear wheel well?  The height and circumference is
about the same as my 14 inch wheels.  I know that 14 inch is stock.

Anyone have any knowledge on this?  If they'll clear, I can go get the
adapters tonite.

Thanks,

Curt
