Subject: putting together a transaxle

Just made an awsome score. 
My '60 panel just recently lost 4th gear on the way
back from High Country. Had to drive home most of the
way in 3rd...
So yesterday a co-worker came in and said, "Hey Russ,
You're into those old busses...I saw a guy in my
neighborhood that has a bunch of old busses in his
yard...real nice ones!" 
I tried to divine if they were splitties or loafs
(loaves?) but to no avail. So at lunchtime we drove
down there. Lo and Behold, there were two split
busses, and about eight early bugs. The owner was
home, and he answered the door. I says,
"This is a long shot, but by any chance do you have a
spare transaxle?"
Sure enough! 
The guy had a '66 standard that he had welded a 23
window roof, and rear clip to. He put in a type 3
tranny with a straight axle kit, and had the old one
laying around, apparantly in great shape, not popping
out of any gears. It was just taking up space in his
garage, so he let it go for $50! woohoo. 
So now, I've got to put the axles back on, get
everything together, and install it in the bus. I've
got the Bently manual, so I should be able to figure
it out, and I've read through all the posts that came
up under "transmission" in the archives. But I was
wondering, is there any maintenance I should perform
on the tranny while the axles are still off of it? Any
pointers on putting this thing together would be much
appreciated. Thanks,
-Russ Henry

PS: I already have a big nut tranny in my bus, so I'm
confident everthing will fit ok without having to buy
any adaptors.
