Subject: New Stroker Motor, Transaxle, and reduxtion boxes, NEED Help With Dellorto's

Well the Motor, transmission and rebuilt reduction boxes are in. Wow what a
difference. I went with a 1955 stoker motor using 041 heads and Dellorto
(40s)
carbs.

Anyway now that it is complete I am finding the motor is running pretty
rich. I
took the Dellorotos and tried toning them down to accomidate a bus setup. I
replaced the venturies with 28 mm ones(from 34), the main jets with 120s
(from 146)and idle jets
with 60s(from 65). What I am wondering is, it possable the idle jets are
still to big for this setup and is
possably why it could be running so rich? Or is there something else I
should be
looking at? Any and all help is appreciated.

For those that wanted the specs on the gear box the gearing ratio is the
following:
Ring and Pinion  	3.875		MPH (-at-) 3000 RPM
1st 			3.78		18.8 MPH
2nd 			2.058		31.8 MPH
3rd 			1.217		54.2 MPH
4th 			0.821		76.7 MPH
I am not sure if this accounts for the reduction boxes or not though...

The transmission was built by Gary Zink of Gary’s transaxles. As most
northwesterners know Gary is the ultimate authority in Washington for air-
cooled transmissions. <Plug>  253-631-4004
