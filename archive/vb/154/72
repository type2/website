I have this thing about never seeing a single drop of gear oil anywhere
but hidden inside the tranny! ;-)  I seal every seam and joint with Ultra
Grey silicone - I even apply a thin coat to both sides of each side plate
gasket! I *could* be over-reacting but there's no dripping ever from my
transaxle.

But everyone's got their own style, which is what makes this so much fun!
