Thanks for the positive review.  Although we do not brand them, our
windshield seals are European made and imported directly by the Bus Depot,
so they are indeed different from what you will get from other suppliers.
Incidentally, our stationary side window seals and 64-up rear hatch window
seals come from the same factory and are of equal quality.
