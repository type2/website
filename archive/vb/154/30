Is it me or are the magazines getting worse. I won't
buy anymore magazines unless they have something
really good in them. I used to pick up every issue of
hot vws and random vw trends. Magazines are the reason
why people think that bullet turn signals, brake light
decklids, and euro headlights are accessories.
