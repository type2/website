Hi Russ,
Remove the tranny and RGB plugs and clean the magnetic ones.  Replace all the 
others with magnetic plugs from your old tranny and junkyard trannies.  Clean 
and have your axles and brake backing plates zinc and 80% gloss black powder 
coated.  Make paper gaskets to go between the RGB halfs and many for the axle 
to tranny area to shim them properly.  Make sure the axle shovel like handle 
ends and the fulcrum plates in the crown gears are not too worn.  Oversized 
fulcrum plates are availible or you might just have to have the shovel 
handles chrome plated to take up the slop.  Most of all drill and tap the 
holes that bolt the RGBs to the swing plate so as to allow you to use 50% 
longer bolts.
