Subject: '60 Door Handle Needed

Thought I'd give the list a try for this....  I'm looking for a driver =
side door handle for my '60 Single Cab.  Preferably with a key, but not =
necessary.  I don't care about  the condition to much, just as long as =
it works.  I've got a pass side one on there now and would really like =
to be able to lock up my Single at night.


Thanks,
