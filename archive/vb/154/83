Subject: axle boot/window seals parts review

The excellent axle boots I used were Febi Bilstein.  They say made in W. 
Germany on the package and the boot.  Why W. Germany instead of Germany I 
dunno, they seem fresher that that.  They do NOT say VW Audi.  The rubber is 
supple, and they fit very well around the 64-67 axle tube end.  I have not 
used these on the 63 and earlier axle tubes, so that fit may be different.  I 
got them at my local VWFLAPS.  They are far superior to the ones marked VW 
Audi, whose rubber is less supple, and whose fit over the 64-67 axle tube is 
not so stylee.  They come with pinch clamps for around the ends, rather than 
hose clamps.   

I also got some windshield seals from Bus Depot.  Dunno what brand, it didn't 
say.  They also were very supple, and fit very well, and I like the way the 
outside of the seal lipped over the metal of the bus, laying down flat.  I 
liked them better than the WW seals.  WW was the only place I found that had 
barndoor windshield seals, and the rubber was less supple.  The fit in the 
bus was good, but the outer lip of the seal does not flip down over the metal 
of the bus as well as the no name brand from Bus Depot.

This is MYOPBO.  I have no stake in any of these places.
