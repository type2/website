The last thing I do when installing the axle boots is
tighten the smaller clamp on the axle tube, while
applying some pressure moving the clamp maybe 3-4 mm
towards the trans.  I do this to relieve some stress
on the rubber which could be caused by axle movement. 
The rubber in these things is not always as long
lasting as I might like.
