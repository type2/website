Subject: Self tightening lug bolts

OK you guys that keep losing wheels from loose lug bolts. I'll swap you the
set off of my 67 SC for yours. Quite frankly, I'm getting sick and tired of
these things. This morning I went out to put my overcoil shocks on the front
of my SC and proceeded to twist my lug wrench. I then got out my 1/2" 18"
breaker bar and my favorite 19mm Proto harden socket, which promptly broke
on the second lug bolt. I then got out my 4 foot cheater bar and my 3/4"
Proto hardened socket and slowly managed to break the rest free. Once I
jacked it up and removed all the lug bolts, they still had the liberal coat
of bearing grease on the threads. I give up. Hey, I'm strong, but not that
strong. What's with these lugs anyway, possessed or what?
