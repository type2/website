Subject: re:seat covers

well i got the seat covers on...they look pretty nice, well compared to duct
tape, and an old mexican blanket, a sheet, and a cheap $10 velour cover they
look SWEET.

For my first try they came out ok-not as smooth as i would have liked. I
used the original little spikes on the frames for all but one part. On this
part-the backrest of teh passenger 2/3 seat, at the bottom, i sewed it with
fishing line. I think this came out the best...if i have a few hours to kill
sometime, i may sew all the others, sewing seems to give a better, more
fitted look to the cover.

thanks for your suggestions as to the waxy/greasy coating on the frames-i
left it alone.
