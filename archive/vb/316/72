you mean the crank pulley, right?    Eric of Eric&BarbVeewee111  gave me a 
good tip about sanding the crank pulley so it is a push fit, so you can easily 
pully it off.  So push it on part way, then pull it off and sand the scratches, 
rinse, repeat till you can push it on.   Not wiggly loose, but if you have to 
crank or whack the lower pulley on, you'll be hating life if you have to pull 
your oil pump on the side of the road.

the torque specs for the bolt are in Muir's idiot book

hey all.
  i am rebuilding my engine (upright  1600cc single port) and cant seem to 
figure out how to put the pully wheel on. i installed the tin with no problems. 
i guess my question is, how do i get it on there. i used a rubber mallet to 
get it on there, but i dont know if that is all i have to do, then put the nut 
on it. thanks in advance, and sorry if it is kinda hard to piece together, but 
its late and im tires. :)
