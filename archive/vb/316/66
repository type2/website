Subject: VB Pictures from the Puyallup Show

Hey everyone- unfortunately I was unable to make it to The Puyallup show- 
Couldn't get the time off of work. Anyhoo, Did any of you people that 
attended it get some good pictures? If so please post links and such- I'm 
eager to see what I missed!
Thanks to everyone in advance

Kelly
66 Standard "Rose"
- So close to being back on the road!
