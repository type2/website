Subject: Re: [VB] Freedom Camper Interior

Several years ago I attended the Colorado August shows (Rocky Mtn and the
Milehigh whatever near Denver). In defense of this type of camper, I was pretty
impressed with a dove blue camper that a youngish couple had at the Rocky Mtn
show.
The camper to which I refer had an asymetrical fiberglass top that was higher
on the cargo door side. The kids picked it up for cheap and were enjoying it
quite a lot. =) The wood work inside resembled the photos that Karl helped us
view via the Japanese site. A similar model of bus was offered for sale within
the last year out of Texas. I was tempted for half of a second to pluck it. It
was at that point that I remembered that there was a perfectly good 63 EZ
camper sitting on my back porch that I had not touched for two years...

Fugly is in the eye of the beholder. Hey, if it is functional and convenient at
a decent price then more power to ya! If you have the desire to and ability to
drive splitties then go for it!
