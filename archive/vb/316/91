Subject: Re: [T2] 205T distributor timing, vacuum question

> Howdy. Finally picked up a nice 205T distributor to replace the 009 for my
 truck, which has a 1600 Single Port, running a 30/31 carb. Seems like
 there was a page that listed all the various distributors, their original
 models they came in, and the timing. Anybody got that link? I plan to
 install it this weekend, and want to make sure it's timed right.

Here is the site:  http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ovhignbo.htm

I assume it is a 113 905 205T?   That means it is vacuum advance only. Vacuum (Advance Only): 17-19deg (-at-) 1.3
In. Hg, 32-35deg (-at-) 3.2 In. Hg   At full throttle, the timing advance goes away.
I think you would be better off with a vacuum and centrifugal advance dist. Like this one:

Beetle 1970 * 1600 Auto-Stick Trans
Distributor: VW 113-905-205AD or AE, Bosch 0231 167 029 > 113 905 205AL, 0231 146 101
Can Use: VW 113-905-205AA, Bosch 0231 115 078
Vacuum Can: 07 138
Timing Set At:: 0deg TDC (-at-) 800-950rpm w/strobe w/vacuum hose disconnected and plugged
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8-12deg Adv; Centrifugal: 13-16deg (-at-) 2200rpm, 25-28deg (-at-) 3900rpm
