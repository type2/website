Subject: Re: [VB] Another clutch question

Use the 70 and earlier type clutch on the engine, and since you cleared the 
bell housing, it should pop in (if the starter is 12V).

If you use the later clutch with the myriad of arms, it'll make a horrible 
noise with the earlier TO bearing (did that once, and had to pull the motor 
right back out)

I'm putting a late 1600 in a tunnel case.  The case has already been 
cleared to take the 12v flywheel and I have a diaphragm type clutch 
pressure plate.  The release bearing on the tranny is the type which 
mates to a thrust ring on the older three prong type clutch.  Question 
is will this old type release bearing be ok or should I be using a 
different combo of pressure plate and bearing ?
