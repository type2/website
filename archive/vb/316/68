Subject: free wolfsburg stickers

I found a brand-new (well, several years old - but never used) pair of seatbelt
stickers cleaning out my desk drawer! Now why weren't these in my tool box?
Thought someone could use 'em, the seatbelts I bought them for are long gone.
They were from West Coast Metric
sticker on back of package reads:
ST-1001
Small Wolfsburg Seatbelt Sticker
Black & Silver
Email if you want 'em
