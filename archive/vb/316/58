Subject: [VB] rear heat vs front heat

Well -
        Its still cold here and i have been pondering a heat issue in my bus.  It is a 64 standard with the heat tube in the passenger compartement.  
        Well, the rear heat tube is covered by a z bed ( which does have holes cut for ventilation by previous owner ).

My question is:  has anybody come up with a way to direct all that heat to the front.  In other words, my heat to the front is kinda bad because its only coming from one heater box is there a way to hook up both to go to the front?

thanks
