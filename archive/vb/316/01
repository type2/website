Hello Dave   the 12 volt flywheel will have to be cut to fit the 6 volt crank 
in the 1200 motor this can be done on a brake lathe, you have to remove the 
outter ridge where the o ring goes and you will have to use a paper or metal 
gasket on the end of the crank instead of the oring   the pressure plate will 
have to be the type that doesn't have the ring on it  later and have fun  Mark
