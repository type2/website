Subject: visiting Colorado Springs

I'm driving down to Colorado Springs Wednesday.  I have an appointment
during the day on the 1st of April then have to kill time all weekend
until my next appointment on Monday the 5th.
Anything VW related happening in the area?
Anyone one want to hit a microbrewery and swap VW lies?
I'll be carrying my cell down there, hit me back pmail if you have
suggestions,
Thanks
