Subject: Freedom Camper Interior

My '67 is a "Freedom Camper", although the interior was pretty intensely 
modified by the 2nd owner (i'm the 3rd).

I've been curious about what the original interior looks like, and I came 
across this while searching:

(clickon on the "???" links for interior pics)

From the bits that I have, I know that it's not what my originial looked 
like, but it's interesting and provides food for thought for those 
designing their own interiors.

cheers,
