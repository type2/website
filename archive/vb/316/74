Subject: going from WA to California...can take stuff

Hi fellow bussers,

I'll be heading south from Oly, WA to the Bay Area for Easter and the BYOB/KP 
shows.  I'll be going down I-5, and can transport items along the way if 
there is interest.  My bus has a roof rack.

Also (shameless plug) if anyone is interested in interior panels to be 
delivered down there, let me know .  Check out the URL below.

Clara
