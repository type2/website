Subject: And now a handbrake cable question...

In the continueing saga of fitting a later (64-67) trans to my '57 I 
thought I had most things covered.

Thanks to everyone who replied to the clutch question - I now have a 
late clutch with guide collar running a diaphragm type pressure plate - 
turns out my release lever was the later type which required the guided TOB.

Anyway I've put the axles and tubes back on the trans today and now I'm 
at the backplate stage and scratching my head over the handbrake cables.

So today's question:  Is there a handbrake cable to use for an early cab 
handbrake lever (under floor adjustment) but late backplate combo ? I'm 
figuring that 64-67 is way too long

I reckon I can modify the backplates to take the early clamp idea 
otherwise - but of course you may know of a bolt-on alternative.

Thanks in advance :)
