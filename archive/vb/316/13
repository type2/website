Subject: Bakersfield VW show report/shifter problem

I had every intention of making this show, it being in my backyard.

Shifter troubles on Sat. made it an impossibility.

Now that everything is new in my linkage to trans dept., I just can't seem to dial it in.

Seems like I can get 2/3/4 but not first.

I think the hole for the set screw in my front shift rod is wallowed out and doesn't allow my the rotation enough to engage first.

I've tried all the adjustments I know, all my couplers and bushings/mounts are new.

Any suggestions are A-Okay.

Sorry to miss you Ronnie and all,

Billy
