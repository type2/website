Subject: Re: [VB] clutch/flywheel question

You can use a steepped FW on your later crank, but if you use a later FW on a 
stepped crank it'll leak.    

If you can find a 6V large clutch stepped FW it's set.   But of course those 
are hard to find.


I was told someone did use a later FW on a stepped crank with lots of sliicon 
goo, but I never tried that myself.

Or it could keep the 6V/ steped FW, and put the 6V starter in with teh 12V 
solinoid, then as you say the later TO issue is there.   I'm not sure about that.

Good question..... now for another one:
More than likely, the 6V flywheel on that 1200 is a stepped flywheel. I do 
not believe you can put a later 12V
o-ring flywheel on a stepped crank.....
