Yes there is a difference.
EMPI / JGE has the ridge and separate center cap
Sears / Randar has no ridge and no center cap

At $1000 or $1800 that's still too much to pay.

I paid $800 for my Original EMPI ones off the SAMBA (I actually had to 
convince David Mayes he didn't need another set as we were both talking 
to the seller at the same time)

On another side note, how about every other Sunday we have "cleaning 
electrical connections"  and every other Saturday will be "grease, 
grease ,grease, and why your Bus loves it"...........
