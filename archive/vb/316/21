yeah, the show was pretty good, and the "line" to get
in was pretty much non-existent. it was good to hang
out with some listees/samba forums people, and good to
see david mayes again. nice weather, decent food, nice
vehicles (a few super nice campers), and some unusual
busses as well. worth the trip for sure. not a huge
swap, but still found some good stuff. if only kelley
park could be so easy.

as far as ronnie's trivia question: if you only needed
2 (or less) 8x1.25 nuts, you could take one off the
generator stand and be ok (to get home), you could use
the one from the battery strap (where it attaches to
the stud on the battery tray), the stock hot air
"mufflers" (heater box-to-body) that attach to the
body have strap clamps that use a 8x1.25 bolt/nut,
early busses have an 8x1.25 bolt/nut for the rear
brake clamp on the axle tube- i'm not sure if i'd use
that unless it was a dire emergency, you could
probably use an upper case half nut if you were
desperate. there are plenty of other places they are
used, but not too many where it's convenient to use
one as a spare. one more reason to carry a well
stocked break-down kit full of unusual stuff you
wouldn't normally think of carrying. or maybe it's
time to put a couple extra on those geneator stand
studs for an emergency like this.
