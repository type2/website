Subject: Had to leave so fast that they couldn't even catch the cat...

See everyone at Phoenix Bug-o-Rama
<in the meantime>

Say "Hi" to Earl and Edith,
Tell 'em I'm doin fine,
Tell 'em you're ready to leave home now,
and they should oughta cut the line...
An' Gramma (should) come see me, 
I've got a new song to sing.
It's longer than the others,
and it don't even mean a thing...\
(Open chord Bridge)
