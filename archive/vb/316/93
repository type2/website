Subject: A post-April fool friday bus thought

I can't believe we made it through April Fools Day
without someone "planning" to crash a 61 Double Door
into a wall to promote seat belt safety, or burn down
a 67 21-window to show everyone what happens when you
don't replace fuel lines, or to blow up a newly built
hi-performance engine to see how long it would take.
I must admit that I am a little disappointed.......
