Subject: front spindle nuts and parts needed!  

Hello, I am in need of both spindle nuts for the
driver side or my `66 single cab.  I need both of the
2 nuts for this side, these are `64-`67 and have the
left hand threads being on the driver side.  I also
need at least one of the passenger side spindle
nuts...these are proper right hand threads...heck will
just purchase all 4 nuts for both sides if anyone has
some.

I also heard that the early bubble window spindle nut
may work...the one with the allen head bolt for
tightening...? is that true...

Also have a buddy who just bought a `67 camper and
needs an entire driver side front spindle with nuts
also!  wow is that weird of what...

I wanna get my bus on the road so any help is
appreciated.

Thanks
Todd
