Subject: pully wheel problems

hey all.
  i am rebuilding my engine (upright  1600cc single port) and cant seem to figure out how to put the pully wheel on. i installed the tin with no problems. i guess my question is, how do i get it on there. i used a rubber mallet to get it on there, but i dont know if that is all i have to do, then put the nut on it. thanks in advance, and sorry if it is kinda hard to piece together, but its late and im tires. :)
