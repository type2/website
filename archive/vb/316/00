Subject: Another clutch question

I'm putting a late 1600 in a tunnel case.  The case has already been 
cleared to take the 12v flywheel and I have a diaphragm type clutch 
pressure plate.  The release bearing on the tranny is the type which 
mates to a thrust ring on the older three prong type clutch.  Question 
is will this old type release bearing be ok or should I be using a 
different combo of pressure plate and bearing ?
