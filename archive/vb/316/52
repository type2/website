The sixth annual EveryBus is coming up in two weeks. There have been 
some updates to the activities and directions pages. The carabus page 
is getting crowded! Check it out!

EveryBus, in case you are not familiar with it,  is an annual 
gathering of buses, Vanagons, and EVs. Each year folks from all over 
the US and Canada come to enjoy a few days of VW camping fun! EB 
takes place at Hagen Stone Park in North Carolina and starts 4.15.04.
