Not to belabor the point Jim but doesn't he want the felts for the *divider* and not the tank? I
have OG felts for the bay tank I have.

[VB] $100 reward for felts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For Gosh sakes David!
I simply eyeballed the black 1/4" thick 3M scrubby that was sitting on the
workbench and cut the muthah to shape(s) and stuffed them into place under the
straps and whoofed the hardware down to what I thought was "GE" Pounds. No one
ever gave me crap for having the wrong felts.
