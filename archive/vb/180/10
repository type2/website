Hi  everybody.

A friend of mine suggested to write to the list.
I just need some help to find any trader or company interested on buying 
some used vans I owe here in Uruguay and now due to financial problems I 
must sell.
Their are not restored and mostly between 1962 - 1967.
Anyone with importing experience would be great.

Thanks so much for your time.

Javier
