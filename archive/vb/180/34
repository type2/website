The jump from .89 to .77 is about 15%. So, at 65mph or any other speed in
4th, your engine will experience a 15% lower RPM. You all can look at the
torque and hp curves and decide from there what you want to do.

.377 rp is about 6.3% higher than the standard 4.125 and 3.44 is about 19%
higher. Maybe too big a jump. If only a 10% solution was available.

Ronnie usually knows what he is talking about too. Nothing else like
testing!
