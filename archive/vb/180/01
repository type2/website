One reason that stuff builds up there is that the threaded boss for the
drain plug extends upward into the plate, creating a "hump
-----------------------------------------
Get real! 
The oil sloshes forward, the oil sloshes backwards, it sloshes to the
right and to the left and that plate is the lowest point. It's that
simple. 
That is why the sludge collects there.
Works just like a galvanized bucket, pour water in and it goes to the
bottom. If you pitch in a teaspoon of sand its going to go to the lowest
point and for some strange reason it doesn't want to climb out.
