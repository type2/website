Subject: 12v radio in 6v bus

well i change the fuse from 5 amp to 8 amp as per wiring diagram, i have not
had time to hook up the capacitor, i have found that i get fairly consistent
results if i turn the radio on before i start my bus. it will kind of turn
off for a second when i turn the bus on, but it comes back on as soon as the
engine is running.

before i tried turning it on after starting engine-and the preformance was
intermitent.

it still cuts out at higher volumes-or bass peaks. i will try ot install the
capacitor soon....
