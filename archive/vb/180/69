Subject: Flat 4 Bus steering wheels

Has anyone else actually seen / handled one of these in person while it
was on a Bus?

I had a customer come in today with his "new" wheel. What a joke, these
things are as solid as a wet noodle. They do look good, and I would
guess that 99% of the people that buy them put them on their trailered
"show Buses" that get driven all of 2 miles a year, on and off the
trailer. I wouldn't trust one of these wheels to take me around the
corner, let alone around the country *driving* my Bus.

My opinion / warning.
Greg
