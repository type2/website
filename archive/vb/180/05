Not now.  I'll try to borrow a camera and do so, If I can get a good shot.
It's really simple, though.  Just cut the 16ga metal into a strip a half
inch or so wide, bend it so that it matches the OD of the pipe around half
the pipe.  Make a second part exactly the same way.  Force both half-rings
into the enlarged hole in the box so that a quarter-inch of the ring
protrudes.  Braze the half-rings to the heater box.

 Anyway-it seemed nice and secure, but after picking my engine up a few
 times, and shiftig it around...they eventually loosened up. Not sure if this

I don't think any epoxy will withstand the tailpipe temperatures.  You
need metal for that.
