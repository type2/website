Subject: re:restoring heat exchangers

hey george could you post s picture of this split ring you are talking
about?

I had a similar problem with my heater boxes-and when irecently had the bus
out, I thought I would do something about it, I got some of that epoxy type
putty, that you basically cut, rub together in your hands, then put in
place, sets in supposedly about 5 minutes-seemed to take a bit longer.
Anyway-it seemed nice and secure, but after picking my engine up a few
times, and shiftig it around...they eventually loosened up. Not sure if this
was due to improper prep of heater box surface...so the putty stuff is still
there, i think it is doing a better job blocking the gaps, but it is not
sealed completely yet.

oh yeah, as for finishing them, i degreased, and painted with this engine
enamel in a spray paint can, paint color "New F*rd Gray" pretty decent
looking gray.
