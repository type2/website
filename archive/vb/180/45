This may sound different!  I bought a '66 westy with a 1500cc engine, 
4.375-1  trans, 72,000 original mile deal 10 years ago.  It worked very 
well.  The 1500 gave good power and owner's manual type fuel economy.  
The 4.37-1 gearing was louder than my '67 with a 4.12-1 at speed but it 
had good pull and got much better fuel economy.  I think that the OG 
setup works well.  I'm not sure what this means.  Bigger is probably 
cheaper than smaller done right.  It seems that you need to figure out 
what you really need and imagine OG as being usable, right the way to 
go.  Maybe this is an issue of OG faith.....         Gary Gibson
