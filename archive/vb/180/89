Subject: 67 deluxe seat question

My 67 deluxe is a non-walkthrough,  but it has some orginal bucket seats up
front. Is this correct? From what i have seen only busses with walk through
partitions have these bucket seats. So did somebody do this to my bus or did
it come orginal from the factory this way???
thanks
john
