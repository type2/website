  These are the same thickness as a 40 hp fan. There is also a plate that
goes on the fan to cover the holes. If you run them with out the plate they
whistle, sounds like a blower. To small to run with any of my type 1's, but
do have these in my 356 engines

Interesting fan.  Anyone running this thing?  Is it any different than our 
regular VW fans?

Take Care,
