[VB] $100 reward for felts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For Gosh sakes David!
I simply eyeballed the black 1/4" thick 3M scrubby that was sitting on the
workbench and cut the muthah to shape(s) and stuffed them into place under the
straps and whoofed the hardware down to what I thought was "GE" Pounds. No one
ever gave me crap for having the wrong felts. Prior to install I had the rough
"Horsehair" looking felts and my "felts" sitting side-by-side and could barely
tell the diff. If you are worried about the 3M scrubby rubbing a hole into the
tank or scuffing the paint, then slip a slightly smaller strip of 1/16th grey
rubber or even electrical tape between the tank and the felt pad.
Psst! I won't tell!!!!
If a concours' de elegance judge ever dismantles the truck to that level then I
might promise to (or have someone else...) kiss your bare butt at noon on main
street during a Fourth of July parade.

Most tanks that I see don't even HAVE felts much less the off-white felt/foam
that goes around the retangular hole through which the tanks fuel bib goes its'
shelf.
I can check the bench and see if I have any more NOS felts. I can REALLY use
the Franklin. 
Thanks in advance,
