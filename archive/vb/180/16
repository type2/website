Subject: ceramic coating

Hi All,

I have a header that is ceramic coated from Kymco. Looks great. Have not put
it in the bus so I cannot vouch for durability.

The header does have flanges on the heat exchanger ends so I will have to
weld flanges onto my H.E.'s before installing. I am tired of those silly
clamps that always leak.
