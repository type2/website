My experience is that 3.88 with .82 is a little bit too tall for stock
engines but I run 215/15 rear tires.  I think 14" tires make it doable,
but not sure your going to get 75-80 out of it.  Maybe 70-75. My 67 runs 3800
rpm at 75mph using 215 15 tires. (3.88 with .82 4th)  Depends on what you
consider redline I guess.
Think about running some extra oil cooling
as it seemed to up the temps when I went to taller gearing.
