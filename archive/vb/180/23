I've been thinking...

I think Mr. Mayes would be better off purchasing a rusty but all original
Single or Double Cab from which to remove parts from.  I have seen several
for sale since his search for original parts began and I have a feeling
he is getting close to, or may have surpassed, their asking prices.
