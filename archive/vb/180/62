First of all, Warner Bros. is pickier about their copyrights than VW.  The
first time a WB lawyer sees this site the company will be defunct,
probably before they can fill any orders!

Second, why not just make the lights go off with the ignition key?  Quite
a few buses, including my '71, come from the factory this way.  For
vehicles that don't come this way, a single DPST relay will do the job,
and will prevent _any_ draining of the battery.

Why worry about voltage sensing when all you need to do is turn the load
off when the key is off?
