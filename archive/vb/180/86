That's a good start to block off one to isolate the 
problem. Block off both the output of the heaterbox and 
the body tube. Both HE's are probably the same age and 
equally leaky though. I've seen problems with the 
exhaust flares leaking and shooting raw exhaust into the 
loose fitting heat exhanger outer tin. 
Check your exhaust tip. It should extend to the side, 
not the back of the bus. If the muffler isn't stock any 
muffler shop can change or add a tip so the exhaust 
doesn't end up getting sucked into the air vents. I 
guess you could test that by -temporarily- covering the 
intake vents on the exhaust side. Leaky rear deck lid, 
engine/body seal, oil leaks, crankcase leaks, apron 
holes, etc. can contribute to the problem. 
Carbon monoxide and dioxide are killers!
