Subject: The cost of AR

Ok, so I head down to the post office to mail off a small 1lb box of items
going to the chrome shop for the 59 double cab... the guy behind the counter
asks me if I want insurance and I stop to think... hmmm, three screws in
there for the rear pop out latch took me over 2 years to find, the two
little hex bolts correct for early wiper bases were given to me but I had
considered buying nos bases (-at-) $90 just for the tiny 4mm bolts, an original
one-eyed-duck screw, again given to me but probably non-replaceable, 46
original bed slat screws... now those cost me but i wouldn't want to find
another full set, and a few other misc screws, washers, and such.  So, I
says to the guy, $400.  When he asked me the contents of the box, I told him
118 rusty little fasteners from an old VW, he shook his head and gave me my
bill.  I continued by saying it would cost a bunch more to pay the medical
bills if I ever started to bug my friends for these parts again...  When
leaving the post office, I thought to myself, 'I'm sure glad felt doesn't
need to be chromed' :-O
