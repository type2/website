I guess I'll call them.  Their online catalog doesn't show the oil presure 
relief version, but does show the drain plug version.  Oddly, they say to 
drill the sump for the drain plug version, as it is too tall and will hit the 
strainer!   I guess they changed the shape, the sender in my 65' engine does 
not hit the strainer.

ya, I do have a filter on that engine, but don't see any reason to remove the 
strainer.   Maybe with the new sender it is a problem, dunno.

I have the relief plug sender in the motor in my 61, and I like it better 
because the wires are more out of the way, I don't have to mess with the 
sender when changing the oil, and I don't have to be careful with the sender 
when pulling the motor.  If you forget to either pull the sender or use a 
piece of wood with hole drilled in, you smush the sender with the jack.  oops.
