Subject: Spacer for 34pict3

I have found that using the hose from the carb to the aircleaner on a 68-71
Bus works great on my 1776 in my 1965 splittie, or any splittie----All I did
was cut off the curved part on the left side,of the late model hose, which
on my 34PICT3, 1776 motor, would not reach. --But with the curved metal
piece that is on the early splitties coming off the carb, use a clamp at
each end, and all works just VWonderful--Hoses from a late model bus a real
cheap at swap meets and very thick compared to the repop hoses that are out
now. I could have done it without cutting if I just moved the air-cleaner
over to the left--But that required drilling two new holes in the
bracket--and I am lazy--, TWWM,   uj
