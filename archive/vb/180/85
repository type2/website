Jim,

Whooooeeee. Someone finally took Andy Rooney seriously. Remember he is the
one that suggested that the army dump the M1 tank and replace it with
Chrysler Cordoba's. (1970's Ricardo Mantalban style) At $10M/tank you could
purchase 1,000 Cordoba's back when. Top all those with small rocket
launchers anti tank weapons and 50cals. What a fighting force. Take the
battle field with shear numbers or the enemy would die laughing.
