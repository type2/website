Subject: RE: [VB] Transmission Gearing

  It all boils down to how much POWER do you have. I have a 3.88/77 4th in
my DD with large nut rgb. The 1776 I had in it could bareley pull 4th gear
and a stock 1600 would pass me on the slightest hill. When I put the 1800
stroker in it, it was like a whole new ball game. Still hard to pull 4th but
I have the POWER now (look in the archives for the HP/Torque values of this
engine).
   The percentage of drop between 3rd and 4th with the 77 is to much with
the 3.88 r/p. Your trans guy should be able to give you the percentage drops
between gears.
  I am now getting ready to install a 3.44 r/p with a 1.32 3rd and a 89 4th.

much better between gear percentages. This should give me a higher top speed
(I already cruise at 75/80) of which I will slow down to lower my RPM's. I
have installed this same combo in a Westy with a stock 1600 with duel Kaduds
and he has had no problem cruising back and forth to Washington from AZ in
his bus.

ps. I have just about tried every trans gearing and engine combo out there
and so far the 1800 with the 3.88/77 4th has been the best so far till I try
the 3.44/89 4th.

Ok, my transmission (for the '67) is at the rebuilder's shop right now, and
I have a decision to make.  Should I go with a 3:88 ring and pinion or a .77
4th or the r/p with a .82 4th or the r/p with the .77 4th?  I'm looking to
be able to cruise at about 75-80 mph on flat road.  What do y'all suggest?
Could anybody tell me an estimated cruising speed for the highway for each
setup(assuming stock tire size)?  It's running the stock '67 big nut redux.
boxes.  Thanks.
