Use the hose off a 68 to 71 bus. The one piece style without the metal
bracket that sits on the carb.

I must be looking wrong at this or something because I'm sure lots of
people run this.  I have a 67 bus I"m putting my spare 1600 DP with
34pict3 in.  Using the stock air cleaner, the rubber connector hose seems
a little shaky.  The carb is below the air cleaner enough that it seems
like the rubber hose is probably stressed too much by the time the engine
starts shaking around and all.  Is there a spacer for this?  The 30pict
spacer would be too small and too tall.
Thanks,
JOhn
