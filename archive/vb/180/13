If you had these on your Bus before you know if they leak, but if not, it
might be good to test before you work them over.  I got a couple of big
rubber plugs from the hardware store and made a hole in one of them.  I
put them in the cylinder and muffler ends of the pipe, and tried to pull
a vacuum on the heater box using my hand vacuum pump and the plug with
the hole.  You could probably do the same thing with an air compressor
with gauge.  Even though the plugs sealed up well, I never could pull
a vacuum, which indicates that the inside part was leaking.
