Subject: Re: [VB] Divider Felt info

The felts are 4 long strips covering the entire perimeter, same width and
material as the gas tank felts. Also - oval type holes are punched into the
felt so once it was glued to the divider, it would match up to the oval
holes on the divider so you can adjust the divider with the screws started.
I will take some pics of some felts tommorow, my camera is out of batts.
Also ill take some pics of the correct bubble head sheet metal phillips
screws with fat washers for you. I remember you asking about what kind they
were etc. Actually ill just scan the screws and send them to you.

>anyway, the question is: are the divider
plate felts short like the gas tank ones or are they four long strips... one
for each edge?

BTW, i'd really like to see a few pics of og truck felts that any of you
might have.  I think I have a picture from a 66 coming my way.  Anyone with
an earlier truck?
