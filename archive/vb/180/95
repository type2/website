Subject: Heater tubes?

Howdy Volks,

On my '66 Deluxe the previous owner had jerry-rigged the heater tubes(?)from
the heat exchangers to the body tubes(?) that bring the heat fwd.  Any good
source for the 'correct' tubes?  My guess is 2" ID  on one end and 2-1/2" ID
on the other end.

Thanks for the help/advice,

Gary
