Subject: HOE-LEE scmokes~ now *HERE* is next VW trend!

Trend of the year? Pffft please...
One year barndoor buses are priceless the next you cant give em away, next year
freak buses are popular the year after you sell yours, Camper bus popularity
wanders from Sundial, Westy, Early Westy, poptop this, to Dormobile that,
Syncro this to Eurovan that. A rolling HAM shack or rolling sound studio with
Satellite radio stations? Perhaps but not QUITE cool enough for me... 

Put all of that behind us and let's get real and into the anti-terrorism/Rabid
George the destroyer trend.

My prediction is that ACCESSORIES are the new trend. Check THIS! =)

How about a 50 cal that macs an 18" target at 60 meters! Comes complete with an
electrically operated folding ragtop roof section. Forget getting that CCW
permit and just pack heavy on the daily commute.

Happy Motoring (and be sure to check the mirrors before changing lanes!)
