Did they coat the inside of the heat exchangers?

For a header the full dip is the way to go as moisture is contained on the 
inside of the header in the form of condensation when the motor starts to 
heat up.

Again if they can spray the outside of the HE and not get the inside that 
sounds perfect.

Take Care,
Adrian
