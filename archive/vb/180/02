Subject: snake oil.

Stan,

I like your logic. (read with enthusiam!) I don't think any other subject
other than Rust has caught everyone's attention as much as this.

Thanks Ronnie. After all these posts, you better have a really well written
report complete with graphs charts and 8 x 10 glossies, otherwise you will
be relegated to the Group W bench. We await your wisdom.
