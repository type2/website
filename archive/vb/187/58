Really any rubber seals. They get a set to the oil and a switch distrubes 
this. It is like mixing chemicals. you can mix 2 with no proble but add a 
3rd and you get a reaction. Same with syn and petro oils. if you mix the two 
together your oil will turn to goo. They just don't mix and the rubber is 
porous so it takes in both and the reaction is that the rubber goes south. 
Gets soft and leaks. because seals get a set to an oil and if you change 
that it is gonna leak.

list. but what seals are you referring to? the axle boots? or the seals near
the RGB's? excuse the ignorance on tranny's

The main thing with the gear oil you put in a VW trans has got to be
compatible for use with brass syncros. Another problem with switching for
petro based to synthetic is that it can wipe out the seals. The seals have
been conditioned to petro based and switching to synthetic can cause the
seals to disenigrate due to the difference in the chemical make ups. I would
run the synthetic in the new trans for longer life. The mfgs. of trannies
for the big rigs have gone up to 7 years - 750,000 mile when synthetic is
used from day 1 but with regular gear oil it is 3 years - 350,000 miles.
They are running 50wt in those trannies. So I figure if they will up a
warranty to double plus then synthetic would be the best way to go for long
trans life. But only with a new trans or with all seals replaced first or
you will be changing seals in the very near future. And I hate when that
happens. Stressed point here is make SURE that the synthetic you use is
compatable with gl-4 specs or your syncros will not last.
