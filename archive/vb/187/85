Subject: Re: [VB] Adjusting the clutch

It really isn't the pressure from the cable that is an issue, as you want to 
adjust it so there is a half to one inch play before the clutch is engaged.  
The problem tends to be when the wignut rusts to the cable and like any nut 
rusted to threads it sticks.   Remember, your bus loves grease.  Grease is 
good.  Grease those threads, and they won't rust, and you'll be able to reach 
up there and turn it easily with one hand for years to come.   If it is 
crunchy, get a pair of vise grips on the bit between the cable and the 
threads, not on the threads nor the stranded bit. (A flashlight is very 
useful here.)  get a wire brush and brush off the threads that you can and 
spray liquid wrench (watch your eyes) and grease the threads.   Find a very 
small adjustable wrench, and use that to turn the ear of the wingnut.   I 
have one that is maybe 4-5" long, so I can get it in there and adjust it to 
the thickness off the ear, and turn the ear.    If the ear bends or snaps 
off, you'll need to use a pair of vise grips on it, remove it, clean those 
threads proper and grease them and install a new wingnut.
Since that's such a PITA,  it's nice to remove the wingnut and clean & grease 
the threads when you do an engine pull, if the wingnut is hard to turn.

 Engine is in the bus. - Thanks - K
