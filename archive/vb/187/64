Subject: re:switch to synthetic

according to what you say eric....since i am running castrol right now, if i
switch to synthetic i should use castrol synth.

what i am confused about is the previous posts stating that there could be a
problem with seals that have been exposed to dino juice for a while then
being exposed to synthetic...the posts indicated that the seals would
deteriorate and leak....is this just with tranny fluid?

thanks for any input...
