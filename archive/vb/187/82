Subject: Adjusting the clutch

Hey,

I am about ot undertake one of my least favorite procedures on my bus.
Adjusting the clutch.  I made it (now it's been 6 + months) from 'Sunny
South Florida', up to the 'Not So Sunny' PNW without having to perform this
adjustment.  I have put off this routine as long as I can, but having to
match the revv's while shifting is getting old.

I have a later wingnut cable/config, and I was wondering if anyone had some
tricks to relieve the pressure from the cable to facilitate adjustment.

Engine is in the bus. - Thanks - K
