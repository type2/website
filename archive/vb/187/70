i put mine under #3 sparkplug, but even finessing the shape of the 
sender to conform to the plug, it is still usually hard to get a 
socket on the plug ... and i suspect that the threads and the 
placement of the electrode in the cylinder are suffering a bit, as 
well.
anyone have a swell trick to get the sender and plug to play well together?


btw - i have found that #3 in a properly-running motor will register 
350 F as a matter of course. any time it is above that, it is time to 
find the problem! also, i have watched it climb to 400 on a long 
climb or against strong winds - when driving, i really don't watch 
the speedo or oil pressure gauge, i watch the CHT. if it heads to 
400, time to  s l o w   d o w n.
