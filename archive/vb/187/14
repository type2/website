Interesting!  This is the first time I saw this.

We are the exclusive U.S. importer for the one I sell, which doesn't come
from Simex (the brand on his tent; never heard of it myself).  But
admittedly the one pictured in his ad looks the same as mine. From the
similarity, I suspect that both tents come from the same actual factory,
even if marketed under different brand names and by different companies.

Of course he's getting $350, and I'm charging $199.  I kind of feel sorry
for the people who are buying them on Ebay.  Heck, for what he's charging,
for all I know he could even be buying them from me at $199 and rebranding
them himself!   :-)

It never ceases to me how much people will pay for stuff on Ebay.  I once
put a CD burner on Ebay, and stated right in my listing that it had cost me
$120 brand new.   I'll be darned if it didn't bid up to $140!  Absolutely
incredible!   I guess there really is a sucker born every minute, and most
of them have an Ebay account.  :-)
