Subject: 1961 23 window Bus owner finally  ?'s about how to go about

Got the bus finally as I had dickered with the guy for over a year now but he
finally relented and sold me his bus! We started at $3200 a year ago and I
finally got it home for $1300  http://204.26.80.78:8084/robdeluxe/deluxe.html
Lots of work ahead and if you see something I need and you got it please let
me know
I know I need
4 pop out glass
1 skylight glass
1 front windshield
1 right side front door glass and vent glass
rear glass for a 1961
and a sunroof canvas.

Lots more I know but this at least to keep the Nebraska winter out of it (OK
it is going to be parked in side but I still need the stuff)
Looking for hints and expertise on how to go about this.
Nazi or Custom?
Big nut or Type 4 with bay underlings?!
IT is like I have a blank canvas and can do what I want.
Give me hints and ideas please

If you have had a 23 window done at a restoration shop we need to talk please
pmail me!
Thanks
Lots more to come!!!
