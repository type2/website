Rob,
For serious questions regarding bodywork you could always contact John Jones.
For restoring a transporter, especially a deluxe, contact Douglas Denlinger.

You suggested that at this point it is a blank canvas which could go stock or
wild custom. I suggest that you have John Jones graft in a solid roof a second
set of doors. Make it a double door panel. ;-)
Good luck with the resto and your marriage. Occasionally, one tends to affect
the other.
