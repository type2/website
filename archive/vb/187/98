Subject: Couple new items

  We have just released a couple of new items

1. MUD FLAPS, we now have mud flap sets with the vehicle dates on them.
Years covering 1958 to 1970 for buses and bugs, complete kits, brackets and
all hardware included.

2. After never being available we now have new BOTTOM  felts for the non
through the glass latches on VW buses.  Nobody has ever given a definite
date on when used but I have seen them used on buses from 1958 till
1963.These have never been available in the after market, but we have them
now.
