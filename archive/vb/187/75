Subject: Re: Switches for a '67

All,

Just got back from a little vacation.... we saw a beautiful orange/white
splittie and a single cab in Roseburg, OR.  Nice to see them driving around
in the middle of the week.

We are working on the headlight and turn signal switches today.  Your input
should help us in our plight to get the old girl in tip top shape again.  I
will keep the list posted on our progress (or regress, as the case hopefully
will not be.)

Chat atcha later,
Greg & (Father in law) Dan

'67 Standard
'74 Beetle
(Mother in law wants a New Bus.  We'll see.)
