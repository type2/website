Subject: Rear main bearing area issue

Well everyone here is one I have never seen before. Today I started an 
engine build for the kombi due to the present engine has a rod knock till 
oil pressure hits. I had an engine waiting for a project that had burned #3 
piston. So I started to just do p & c's but when I drained the oil there was 
alot of metal and a nice 1" square chunk of piston. So a teardown was in 
order. The engine came out of a nitrogen trailer and was the used to pump 
product off. Once I split the case and removed the bearings I got a real 
suprise.

As you can see in the pics the rear main bearing area was a bubble zone 
during the casting process and is the only place I found like that. This 
engine was a GEX rebuild and they used this case not knowing what 
application (99.9% autos) it would be used. The case does not need align 
bore but I am open to suggestions as to if I should use this case or make a 
nice fire with it? Kinda makes you wonder about what has gone into your 
engine if you bought a rebuilt when someone like GEX used this case. Even 
with all the bubble holes the 2 halves seem to have the same amount of wear 
so it is not like it is breaking down. But it was used in a stationary app 
and not an auto. Another nice thing GEX does is they paint every thing with 
silver paint inside and outside. Of course it was peeling off.

HMMMMM... maybe a little bondo or spot putty?......lol

Thanks all
