Fellow listees,


I just discovered that one of the original sellers of vintage parts, whom
I used to deal with many years ago, was still in business, and full of
hard-to-find parts for buses and bugs. Vintage Parts, Inc, who used to be
in Burbank, CA, moved several years ago to Glendale, and I just visited
them today for front-end parts.

They don't get mentioned here on the list, so I'm mentioning them - you
can call them at 818-500-8778; they have a large fully-illustrated catalog
like they used to, and tons of high quality German, Brazilian, and NOS
stuff, and lots of the small rare bits that drive some of us crazy trying
to find. Their website is:

Check them out - and tell'em I sent yah!
