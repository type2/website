Subject: Re: [VB] 50MPH Whine--??

When I had my backlash setup too tight there was a whine in all gears. 
The faster I went, the louder it was. Now that I have more clearance 
between the R & P the whine is reduced. The only whine I have is at the 
top of the 3rd range and during some of the 4th range. That seems to 
make sense in that the R&P is really the only gear set that is always 
engaged and is spinning faster in direct relation to the speed of the 
vehicle. If the top of the 3rd gear is say 40 mph and the bottom of the 
4th is 40 mph, whine would be heard in both gears. Note: I do not 
remember the actual redline MPH of my bus in 3rd so 40 MPH is just a 
number I am using as a example.
