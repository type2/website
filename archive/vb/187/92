Subject: re:adjusting the clutch

what i tried last time was to take a bent piece of metal..bent in a hook.

Use this with one hand to hook around the arm that the clutch cable goes
through, then with you other hand adjust the wing nut, i just spin the nut
as much as possible, as it is easier to loosen then tighten...

good luck
