Bases  (like in drain cleaners) etch glass, so its a good idea to store them 
in plastic.    in fact if you store a strong bases in a glass bottle with a 
glass stopper, it welds the stopper on.

Acids don't etch glass.

 I noticed at the home center the really caustic drain cleaners were kept
 in a plastic bottle wrapped in a plastic bag.  Could you do this at home??
