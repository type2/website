Subject: Re: [VB] Tent question

About 12 years ago my x wife found a 1970 westy tent at a garage sale for
$100 and was in great shape. I have used it camping with my p/u's and it
works great. This summer I am gonna try it with my Kombi. If you can find
one they are really great. You could be in 3" of water and still be dry
inside(rubberized floor). They are a bit bulky(fits in 2 army sized duffel
bag, 1 for poles and 1 for tent. The poles take about 1/2 a bag) but sturdy.
Setting up and taking down are really not too bad. I have never had a
problem mine. I even left a pole at home and still got it up and she worked
just fine. Basically you lay the tent out, stake the corners and sides,
connect the poles over the tent, hook the tent to the poles and raise it up,
thumb screw the legs when all the way up and tie the corners down. Plus the
tent hooks to the drip rail(have not tried that yet) but last time we went
camping in it we put 3 twin sized mattresses in it and my daughter, son and
myself slept great and still had room leftover. If you can find one at a
reasonable price(mine is not for sale....lol) I think you will be really
pleased and have a tent that will last for years to come. If you have time I
would try to obtain one but the can be a bit pricey VS. what you can get a
modern tent for. Also what ever ten you decide on get your self some good
stakes. I used 12" x 3/8" nails from Lowes. The drive in nicely and hold the
tent down. And they are less than a buck. Not an ad for 10-10-220 (leave the
cat alone Alf).
