Subject: Looking for Chadd McGee and wiring question

I am looking for Chadd McGee (gobugin(-at-)aol.com)who I have a business dealing
with. Anyone out there have a way of reaching him? His mailbox is full.

Also need to replace the wiring harness on my 65 bus. Who makes the best
wiring harness out there? I figure this is easier than trying to deal with
the rats nest I presently have.

THanks

Michael
