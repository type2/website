My instinct says not to re-use the case.  To maybe lend a little support
to that, do you know why #3 was fried?  Did it lose a valve, or lose
cooling air, or ???  Do you know about how many hours were on the engine
when it blew?  Is it a replacement case or an original (and if so, how
the #$(-at-)% did it get out of VW looking like that?)  Something else I wonder
about is if there are more bubbles elsewhere in the casting that just
didn't get exposed by the machining.

If you decide to toss the case, you might cut out that main bearing area
as a trophy.  If there's a nearby university with a mechanical engineering
program, the professor that does "properties of materials" might like to
see or have that part.  I know one such prof at the local University and
he is always looking for stuff that is broken in interesting ways.

Naah - those are fiberglass or plastic.  You need to fill it in with
real metal, like solder.
