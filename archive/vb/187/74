Subject: synthetic stories...

I have switched 3 different cars over to synthetic oil and had no
problems with leaks. I have not done an aircooled VW yet, but will
probably the double cab over at the next oil change. I do believe that
alot of people make up alot of stories that get passed along. If it is
new it is bad. I don't have the technical knowledge but my first hand
knowledge is that the oil leak thing and it will dissintegrate seals is
a myth. I do know that on a molecular level the synthetic is finer, so
like the other poster said if you already have a leak it may leak a
little more but it did not create any new leaks on our cars.
hope this helps,
Craig
