Subject: Re: [VB] bus seats wanted!!!!

Would anybody out here know where I can get one close by?? How do you
guys find these things??

Try All Foreign Auto Salvage on Elliott Reeder Road in Fort Horth.
He has nice middle, rear seat from 65/66 in Gray vinyl.
If you'rwe needing parts its worth looking at this donor van for other
stuff, he has just to one so this isn't a splittie glory hole.
