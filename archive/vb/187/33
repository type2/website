Subject: Re: [VB] VW vs Porsche oil cooler

was that the kind that looked like the dome top coolers- I think the porsche 
ones have the flange for the fan shroud to bolt to?  

Other kind of porsche cooler I saw (think its neat) was made more like the 
doghouse cooler, but attaches up right..   Seemed a good idea for better 
cooling on you 36hp if you wanted to keep a stock fan shroud.

in a
 1999 catalogue, it was listed at $370. Huh? It looks just like the 
equivalent VW
 part... Does anyone know what makes for the great difference in price?
