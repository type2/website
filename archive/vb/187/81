Subject: Case?

I know it's a long shot(a very long shot), but would anybody happen to have
a motor with case number H 0297862 ?  This is the original motor for my '67.
Also, how about case number H 111802X ?  This motor was put into my '67 on
1-10-71(I have the warranty voucher card from it) at 38,819 miles.  Thanks.
