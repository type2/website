I hate 34-picts as when they clog up they are hard to clean.   I have a few 
of them used- any takers at $10 a pop?

this morning I put a 28- pict on the 1600sp in my 61.   It's torquier than 
the 30-pict I pulled. (which was acting funky and I think it's clogging).    
Eventually I'll see what kind of milage it gets- I hope this will improve it. 
  Came off a friends dead engine- before the engine seized due to long term 
oil starvation and recent puking oil cooler seals he got 27mpg.  I used to 
get 31 with a 28 in my first splitty.   I'll clean the 30-pict and put it on 
the 1600DP in the 65 instead of the 30/31 pict on there.  I was warned 
against a 28 on a 1600 as it's 'too small', but whatever.

But that question is kinda like asking what's the best oil, or what beer you 
drink.
