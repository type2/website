Subject: VW vs Porsche oil cooler

I was admiring a '63 356 today, the owner lamented that he wanted a new oil
cooler but they cost $900. That didn't sound right so I looked up the price in a
1999 catalogue, it was listed at $370. Huh? It looks just like the equivalent VW
part... Does anyone know what makes for the great difference in price?
