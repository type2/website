Subject: flip seat table

Well everyone this is another request for parts, I am still looking for a
table and leg for a 61 to 63 flip seat westy. Not to mention the hanging
light, water jugs,...heck I will buy any campbox parts for a flip seat, but
I really need a table.  I also still need 17 interior panel screws and
washers. Any leads would also be appreciated, also let me know if I can help
you out as well with any Westy parts.
Thanks for your help
