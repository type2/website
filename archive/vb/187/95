Subject: blower set up for heater / oil temp set up

Made up my first prototype for adding a blower for the heater. Made from ABS
pipe w/ blower mounted to it. It worked great, but this blower motor is too
weak. It was out of a kit (circa 1979) I found in my parts. The kit was for
improving heat in a VW. I posted the instructions and the prototype here:

Also here are some pics of an industrial motor set up for oil pressure and
temp. The temp is a grounding switch for a light and is (-at-) 185F temp.

I am going to try to locate a more powerful blower this week. And I will
report how it does. By the set up I did tonight with a more powerful blower
should be the ticket. It had great heat temp but not enough CFM. It did take
the chill off.
