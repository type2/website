Hey Jim Ellis,.... explain your pnzxtn plate to everyone... 

Here's some hints:

1) It's a male thing.
2) Think of the cherry picker with the boom straight up in the air
3) The last three letters are a common abbreviation.
4) the first three letters you have to slur together a bit.


Got it yet?

Several people have emailed me and wondered:
>>My second choice was Jim Ellis' 'PNZXTN'
and the lady looked at me and said 'Now what
does that mean' and I replied, 'Think about it'<<

Allright, I'll take the bait... So what does that mean???
