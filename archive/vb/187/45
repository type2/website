A tip with this style tent....... I have one and it keeps you dry!!!!!
However, I would hook my tent to the drip rail and when you got a real
tropical deluge of rain, it would overflow the drip rail/vinyl moulding and
leak into the tent in good quantities.

The solution...... duct tape!!!!! Just duct tape the vinyl moulding/drip
rail intersection from the inside and problem solved!!
