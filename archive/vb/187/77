Subject: Re: [VB] CHT Sensor location?

400 on a long climb or against strong winds - when driving, i really
don't watch the speedo or oil pressure gauge, i watch the CHT. if it
heads to 400, time to  s l o w   d o w n.
------------------------
The CHT is just a monitor .............. it doesn't hurt to see 400 on
ocassion. Just don't force it at that temp.
