Subject: RE: [VB] VW vs Porsche oil cooler

I think there is a difference between the coolers for the 36hp engine... or
at least that's what the old vintage speed books say (making the vw go and
souping the vw).  My mag supercharged okrasa 36hp engine for my ghia has a
porsche cooler for it.  I don't have an extra stock 36hp cooler laying
around to compare it to except for on a couple of whole engines.

It was asked:

oil cooler but they cost $900.
