  I just got off the phone again with Rancho and the consesess was DO NOT
use syn gear oil. There are a lot of technical reasons why not to which
everyone can find for themselves. 
  All my buses (over 5) have Rancho trans in them with up to 50,000 miles on
one of them and 1000's more on the rest. I use straight 90 weight GL 4 and
have never had a problem. I do add LUCAS oil to all my trans and RGB though.

  Todays brass (syncros) sre made of a different alloy then they were 30
years ago so GL5 will not affect the new syncros as it would old ones.
  I would tend to agree with Rancho as they build over 300 transmissions a
month from 350 dollar stockers to 7000 dollar full on race trannys.

ps. I do use syn oil my stroker 1800 though

Well, from the point of view of Rancho (and any transmission rebuilder),
it is conservative to stick with has been proven in the past.  Nobody is
going to blow up a transmission running it on conventional gear oil.

If they were to say "sure, run synthetic", a customer might go out and buy
some fly-by-night concoction marketed as "synthetic" but actually made of
banana juice.  When the transmission let go, who would get the blame?
