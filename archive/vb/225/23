Wonder if those are the same machines I used to use back in junior high
(mid 70's) during self study classes.  They were small units that you
put rolled up 35 mm film strips into and then you took tests/studied on
a viewer at a cubicle. BTW for all you little tikes this was pre-VHS
days. 

Maybe look at/in obsolete school supply places.  Just a thought.
