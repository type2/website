Subject: Garage sale at EB

I found a bunch of stuff in my garage that I'm going to bring to EB. A
lot of FI parts, tools, accessories, etc. ALL PROCEEDS WILL BE DONATED
TO THE TYPE2 LIST!!!!!! The list has been really valuable to me as a
wonderful source of information to keep Goldie on the road and I feel I
should give something back.  If anyone wants to do the same it will be
greatly appreciated. Can't wait till I leave next Thursday. TBear

Don't take life to seriously--you'll never live through it.
