From what I see in the scematic the relay set up is hooked up similar to
the Vanagon relays that I have been selling to the folks with Vanagions.

I use a red wire off # 30 on the relay to the power source.
A Black wire off # 55 on the relay to
ground.

It looks like on the scematic, that you would split the yellow wire off
the dimmer for the L/H headlamp to the switch, and run the "in" wire to
# 56 on the relay, and #57 to the other side of the split wire to the
headlamps--or out.
Duplicate this proceedure for the white wire for the R/H side.

This is what I am reading in the VW shop manual--for up to a 79 Bus---
check it out and see if in fact these are the color coded on the wires
off the dimmer switch--from what I'm reading it is--

Later,

Terry

I've looked at Matts write up and I've been to Stern Lighting page. The
one thing I don't understand is I keep the Dimmer relay in circuit (that
I understand) But does the power wire from the #56 terminal still send
power to the lights along with the relay? and will this cause an issue
when running power to the relays for the lights. I plan on running 3 10G
wires from the back for low beam/high beam and Hella driving lights. I
just a bit confused on running from the dimmer switch
Matt will prolly come on here and clarify things for yah, but your new
relays will switch the current from those new 10G wires you're running
over to the lights. The Dimmer relay will choose which new relay gets
coil-power. That should get you started.
