Subject: weird aftermarket cranks?

digging thru the core pile today, i found a 40hp or1500cc crank 
(haven't cleaned it to measure journal width yet), with NO VW stamp, 
but raised lettering stating MADE IN WEST GERMANY. does that bring a 
manufacturer to mind, or is it just a vw oddity.

also, there were several - 40, 1500, 1600 - with a stamp: D<e>W. i 
assume a rebuilder, but again, anyone recognize it?
