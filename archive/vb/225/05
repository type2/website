WOW!  bob had offered to send me a set of rocker arms and shafts 
since my whole pile of em was a trash heap; not only did he clean 
them, he miked the shafts and bores, ziptied em all nice and 
safe,coated em in stp and shipped em priority!!
i peeked, and he was right: these shafts are smooth as glass (all 
mine had chatter marks). one more part on the new motor that will be 
closer to factory.

mind you, he did this FOR FREE (tho i'm returning you postage at the 
least bob!).


and boy, WHAT did you clean em with? they look NEW.
