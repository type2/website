Subject: Re: [VB] RE: Good source for Redline MT-90?

he is a guy who was rebuilding tranny a couple (few ?) years ago in the 
Olympia area.   Some of the trannies he buildt crapped out.  he hightailled 
it off to themidwest and evidently owes people money still.

FWIW, the tranny in my 65 that he rebuildt is working fine about 25K later.   
Stay-Lube GL-4.  I just replace the axle boots last Friday.  I hated cutting 
off the seamless boots, but they had started to crack and ooze.   The Febi 
boots I put on are really nice.

 I have to add that my transmission is an infamous Todd Hill rebuilt, and it
 does have issues.  It started whining last summer, but the whine pretty much
 went away.  I do not think that this is lubrication-related, and the Redline
 may well have allowed this transmission to continue to live!
