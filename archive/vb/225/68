Subject: Jet question..

E and B,
    Sorry for redundant questions, but the archives don't seem to cover
this.
I know jetting is trail and error some, but I have a few baseline questions.
First off, on the gas (main), my bus runs very well.
Idle.... OK, cold, runs like poop, must keep running with foot and let warm
up, no biggie...But, the condition of idle is not correct.
Mechanic  (I gave up and paid $$ to get her a new carb, and I hoped for a
better tune) cranked the throttle stop screw in half way almost to achieve
idle. Since the bypass screw on the Brosol 30/31 couldn't achieve the
correct speed, doens't this entail the idle jet is too large, evident in a
rich mixture at idle, with 3000pm in HC and 18.3 AF calculated at tailpipe?
This all gets better when you press the gas, like magic.
Engine specs are a 7.1:1 dished bus piston SP with new stock cced heads,
engle 100 cam, new brosl 30/31 with stock jetting. I think idel is 65 aux?
is 60 main is 120, and air corrections I beleive are 135 in that one.
I know our all sotck 1600 70 ghia has one of those and the idle jet is a 45.
So, I could just concievably plug in, say a 50 idel jet. Given the same
setting and the throttle set screw, shouldn't the now leaner mixture just
instant cuase a higher idle? THis should allow me to turn down the throttle
set screw and attempt to achieve idel through bypass and mixture screw
again?
Are there ever a set of circumstances (cam) that you must bump th eidel
speed with the stop screw (as never stated in carb tuning diretions?) aren't
you running off the accel pump at idel if you do this, the cause of my HC
levels, a rich idle supplimented by the accel pump to maintain idle speed?
Thanks,
AL
