Bob,
	The end of the splined trans input shaft rides in a small roller 
bearing in the big nut, the gland nut, which holds the flywheel onto the 
crankshaft.  This gland nut bearing can fail and give symptoms like what 
you are describing.  Did you replace the gland nut?  Grease it when 
redoing the clutch? Good luck!  Gary Gibson
