Subject: Deluxe Luggage rack Install question

Hello VB,
I am installing the luggage rack on the back of the rear seat of a 67 Deluxe.
Should the rail ends stick out beyond the supports on the left and 
right, or should I position the supports to have the rail ends flush? 
Or can someone send me a photo of the stock configuation?
TIA,
-Dan B
