Wow thats a lot.
but the only sizes listed are for the 50.5mm  oversize diameter.
Can anybody make sense of that?

Im going out to measure all of the pulleys I have.

OK found 6. 5 were almost exactly 7" dia the last was smaller like 6 5/8"
dia.


Someone with a stash measure a bunch of pulleys and send me the sizes.
