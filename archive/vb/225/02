Besides grinding the step away underneath the exhaust port for better blend
and flow I install 58mm exhaust guides to further eliminate flow restriction.
I wouldn't do this for a bus or truck motor though, because the excess heat
buildup for the power requirements would shorten valve life. Dune buggies,
bugs, and of course my trike are likely candidates for short exhaust valve
guides.

Subject: [VB] valve guide question


i encountered a valveguide oddity today:  all the guides the local
shop had in stock for a 1600 were 2.4" long (61mm); my head rebuilder
says he needs guides 2.625" (66.7mm). the reason he wanted to replace
the existing guides (besides being too loose) is that he said several
didn't come all the way down the bore. now, i imagine the intake
guides might have been cut and retapered for flow, but the exhaust
puzzles me. rebuilder is uncomfortable putting shorter guides in -
esp on exhaust. he CAN get what he feels is the correct length from
houston; oddly enough it is the same vw part #.

any insights?
