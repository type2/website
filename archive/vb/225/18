I was kinda hoping someone with more knowledge (and a rancho tranny) might
take the hint and call their 800 number and get more info.  I just asked
the guy what they recommended and whether there was any reason not to use
GL5, based on what I heard.  He seemed pretty clear about it: GL4 or GL5.

How long is it supposed to take GL5 to do real damage, anyway?  Minutes,
days, years?
