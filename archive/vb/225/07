Subject: correct 1500cc oil bath part #?

Howdy,
I'm looking for the correct oil bath air cooler part
number, so I can get the right bath for my 1500cc
engine, which would be correct for my 1967 deluxe.

The one I have now is 211 129 613 B. 

I checked in an on-line index (the obsolete
documentation project) and couldn't find the exact
number listed. But I did find the following: 

Part        Description 
211 129 612 (larger oil capacity) for M156, 42-44 HP

141 129 613  42-44 HP

I do know someone who has a 211 129 613 without the B.
What would that be? 

And what's the diff. between the 211 and the 141
prefix?

Any help greatly appreciated.

Jason
67 deluxe "DARTHVW"
