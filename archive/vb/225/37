I hate oil additives. Except the Lucas stuff.
:-)

It's a 'sticky' oil, you can actually pinch it between your fingers and get
it to string between them when you pull them apart. I use it as assembly
lube when putting engines together, and run a half quart in with the oil on
the cam break in (full quart if I'm running a deep sump on the motor).  Good
stuff. I've seen it at Pep-Boys, and sometimes other auto parts stores.
Comes in a white bottle. Doesn't look to fancy in it's packaging. No bright
colors or lightning bolts in the background. haha
