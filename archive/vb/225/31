Well, from the point of view of Rancho (and any transmission rebuilder),
it is conservative to stick with has been proven in the past.  Nobody is
going to blow up a transmission running it on conventional gear oil.

If they were to say "sure, run synthetic", a customer might go out and buy
some fly-by-night concoction marketed as "synthetic" but actually made of
banana juice.  When the transmission let go, who would get the blame?
