Subject: valve guide question

i encountered a valveguide oddity today:  all the guides the local 
shop had in stock for a 1600 were 2.4" long (61mm); my head rebuilder 
says he needs guides 2.625" (66.7mm). the reason he wanted to replace 
the existing guides (besides being too loose) is that he said several 
didn't come all the way down the bore. now, i imagine the intake 
guides might have been cut and retapered for flow, but the exhaust 
puzzles me. rebuilder is uncomfortable putting shorter guides in - 
esp on exhaust. he CAN get what he feels is the correct length from 
houston; oddly enough it is the same vw part #.

any insights?
