Hi Al,
Not at idle or any RPM less than 1,500 or so.  Sounds like you need a smaller 
pilot jet for leaner idle.

Not for a 1600cc run below 4,000 RPM.  The air correction only begins 
operating at mid on up through the higher RPMs.  We are running a 1641cc SP 
with 40 HP air cleaner with no problems.  We just use 20 Wt to keep the oil 
thinner in the cleaner in our cooler climate.

Good questions!  The only way to find out would be to install the vac dist 
and check with an adjustable timing light and tach.  With any old distributor 
and even with the new junk ones this is a needed test to make sure they 
function properly.
