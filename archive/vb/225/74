Ah so THATS what that was! The guy who sold me the Dealer microfische machine was asking me what i
thought that "other machine" was.. About the size of the microfische machine, has nothing except the
typical controls on the front, stop play rewind etc. the place where you put the "tape" is weird
looking, not VHS, bout half the length of a VHS tape and taller then a VHS tape. It works, and has
sound when you hit play even though there was no "tape" to put in it. I didnt pay much attention to
it as i thought it was a BETA tape player even though it didnt look like the right size, been a
while since ive seen a BETA tape. I suppose 35mm film strips would be what goes in it, ill have to
go back over and look. the previous owner of that storage locker mustve been a VW dealer at one
time. Cant wait to see what the box that he hasn't gone through yet has in it.
