Before May 1964, Buses had heater box outlets and mufflers that were both
50 mm diameter.  Since then the heater box outlets are 60 mm and the
mufflers are 62.5 mm.  Page M-11 4 of your '63-'67 Bentley has all the
details. (Including the nifty 211 255 429 50/60 mm adaptor ring, which is
most likely NLA as it was made of asbestos!)

If your heater box outlets and the ducts on the body are the same diameter,
getting a set of pipes and mufflers from a post-May '64 Bus should fix you
up.

Something that can happen on pre-May '64 Buses is that the heat exchangers
get swapped for later, 60 mm diameter ones, but the body tubes are still
50 mm.  Ronnie at Old Volks has plastic tubes that are 60 mm on one end
and 50 mm on the other and replace both the metal pipes and the mufflers.
I have a set of these as my '64 (built Nov '63, but with later heat
exchangers) has this problem.
