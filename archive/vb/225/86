ahh! so is that why i am sometimes able to put a dh fan on my sp 
heads? one shroud i could never get the thermostat to work right no 
matter what i did.
the new shroud goes right on and the thermostat/flaps work on it - 
i'm guessing that i have a different set of flaps in it?
i do recall bending the loop of the non-operational one a bit to make 
it work a tad beter.
the working flaps are in a FI beetle shroud; the flaps were chosen 
out of a big pile, based entirely on looks! guess i got lucky :)
