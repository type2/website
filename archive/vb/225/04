Subject: Re: [VB] Original Paint Dilemma

You can research what the best=weathering paint system/type is, then have
the original paint matched well, then go with it. I suspect, without being
an expert in this field, that a good laquer may be your ticket. My acrylic
urethane paintwork has held up well over the last 8 years. Try and see if
you can get a semi-gloss finish, my friend tonight just told me that it
was possible to get anything from nail-polish gloss to matte, and anything
inbetween, on order. Check it out.
