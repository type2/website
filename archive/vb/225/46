Subject: Bay window front floor  in split bus?

Hey All-

I have access to free sheet metal off of a 75 rust free bus. I was wondering if anyone new how (dis) similar the sheet metal was on the front floor of a 75 bus as compared to a 65' bus. I realize that the outer edges are quite different on a 75' owing to the integrated "step" on later bay window bus. Just wondering if I should bother harvesting a decent floor from a 75 in hopes of repairing some rust holes in my 65. On first glance it looks like the sheet metal around the gas pedal/brakes and on the same area in the pass side *might* be similar??

BTW the 75 is a westy so if anyone is looking for parts please let me know- they are cheep.
