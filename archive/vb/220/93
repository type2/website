Hi Volks,
We take out all the nonmagnetic fill and drain plugs in the tranny and RGBs 
and replace them with magnetic plugs we get from core trannies in wrecking 
yards or our local tranny rebuilder.  Figure that if these are the only thing 
to take out the steel dust from the gears and bearings, more magnets is just 
going to be better!
