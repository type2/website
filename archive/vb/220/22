Subject: Front door seals

I purchased new front door seals from The Bus Depot. There are 4 pieces,
2 long and 2 short. They are all square except for one of the long ones
is slightly rectangular. There seems to be extra material when putting
them on. So I called Bus Depot and they were no help, he actually
recommended The List. That was my back up plan any way. Can any one tell
me the proper placement of these 4 pieces? Where does the rectangular
one go?
Thanks!
