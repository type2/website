Subject: Whoooho! Almost....Got it running, still a few issues

Ok, quadruple check timing and ignition, everything ok here.
Still wouldn't run, so I blamed my 30 pict1/ Rebuilt a 30 pict 3, and got it
running. Runs a tiny bit rough, due to a slow idle. Going to get it to a
good local shop for tuning and a road check.
Thanks for all the help form this list, once again.
Is slow idel a possible too large a jet selection? I don't have a good
selection of jets, so it still will be visiting the shop, I just am not
super frustrated anylonger..
Happiness, almost.. :)
