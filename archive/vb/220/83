It sounded odd enough to be "paranoid" about.
except, for the part about a "cashiers" check
clearing my bank first. In addition to the asking
price
there would be a balance, of 3650.00 to be 
forwarded to a shipper to arrange shipping?

Any one else have offers from a buyer from Africa?

How safe are cashier checks? Can't think it would go
bad, as long as I have the cash in my account, and
retain possession.
