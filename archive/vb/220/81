Doliwa has the change at 469 447, 19 May 1959.  Apparently they changed
to the "modified 40 hp" or "bastard" engine at the same time.  The '67
parts list online says the split-case transmission was used up to 469 505.
I don't think the '50-'62 Bentley directly mentions the chassis number
for the transmission change, but it does mention a change in the RGB
ratio from chassis 469 506.
