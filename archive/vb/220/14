Subject: Re: [VB] Speedo question . . . 

Thanks to all who replied!! I am still stumped, though. Everyone agrees that 
it is a type 1 speedo. Some thought it is a '62, but did they need to have a 
speedo that goes to 90mph then? Maybe it is kph instead . . . My '68 type 1 
has the fuel gauge in the speedo and only reads to 80 mph - it has the marks 
that suggest when to shift, too. This mystery speedo lacks those. 

Back to school for me. When I figure it out, I will post.

Thanks again and happy VWing -
Greg
