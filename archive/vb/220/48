I complete agree with what Barb wrote about traveleing overseas.  (except I 
didn't know the bit about shorts). 
I also found helpful a 'Wicked German' phrasebook, which taught me show to 
say things like "hazelnut schnapps won't help him now", and how to call 
someone a robber baron.  Really, these were good things to know.   Also, 
spargelsuppe is very tasty.

 Good luck and go and have the trip of your life!!
