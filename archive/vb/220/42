Subject: RE: [VB] safari windows

I have Dave Palmer's Safari's, and I really like them a lot.

The set comes complete with everything, unlike some of the others.  By the
time you ad in what you would pay for all of the "Extras" with others like
Wolfgang's, Creative Engineering Safaris are not all that more expensive.

I got mine direct from England, and with shipping, they were still less than
$500 for the set.

I live in Southern California, and although it does rain here occasionally,
(in fact, it's supposed to this weekend), almost every bus owner who rides
in my '67 Sundial says, "Boy, I wish I had Safari Windows" when I have them
open and it's hot outside.

Good luck,
Ed
