 How about an obstruction wrench to get at the back carburator nut on type
 1 engines?  Anyone find a good one?

the front (near fan housing) one is the tricky one.  I use a thin sided 13mm 
wrench, no name brand.  my ex gave me a fancy 13mm/14mm ess shaped snapon 
wrench  for this purpose cause he didn't like my generic wrench.   I find the 
ess nice for the muffler nuts, but actually like my old no name brand 13mm 
wrench for that front carb nut.  It just fits verra nice
