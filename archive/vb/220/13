No, I was referring to the reversable ratcheting box/open end wrench set
#42407 that has the toggle to switch ratcheting directions.  These
resemble the regular forged box/open end wrenches very closely with only
a little more thickness around the box end.  Very slick and nice to use.

The set contains 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 18mm wrenches.  I have no idea
what 15 and 18mm wrenches are used for, except that the 15 is
used on the valves of Mexican type 1 engines where you don't want a
ratchet.  IIRC, the 17 and 19mm sizes were available on the rack at the
store.
