Subject: Needed: Dove blue hinges, pass door, upper

Have some old junk splitty doors laying around? Can anyone help me out? I need passenger side,
upper, front door hinges, dove blue. Weathered dove blue paint ok as long as they function. What do
you have? I need 2 but maybe you have 1? Cut em off the door and send em over.  Lets make a deal.

Thanks for any help
