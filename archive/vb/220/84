If you are saying someone from Africa (or anywhere) has offered to pay you
more than your asking price for your VW, do not do it.

THIS IS A SCAM.

They will send you a cashier's check which is either forged or bad.  It will
bounce some time later and your bank will automatically debit your account,
leaving you responsible for the full amount.

The end result is you end up losing what ever you give them, which sounds
like $3650 in your case.  They never pick up your vehicle because they only
want the cash.

Repeat, THIS IS A SCAM.
