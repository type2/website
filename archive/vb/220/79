Subject: International Shipping?

need some input!
 
never been involved with an international sale before,
does this sound right?

as with any transaction...If something can go wrong it
will.


He will send me full payment, plus fees for shipping.
after certified check clears my bank, I send the
balance to his shipping agent, in the form of money
gram,international transfer?

I will meet with shipper & transfer title to him.
