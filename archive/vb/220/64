Subject: some questions

Putting my bus back together today came up with some questions. I recently
bought a working 67 deluxe radio, it comes with this transistor and two wires
going to it. where did this mount at? It has heat sinks also, there are two
holes in it, you can tell it was suppose to mount somewhere....but where??

Is the dash grab handle the same as the partition grab handle??

The transistor part of my radio is bad, but if I by pass this part, the radio
works, I was told that all i had to do was buy a 1 dollar transistor and
solder it in....Anybody know where I could get one of these??

My passenger's side 2/3rds seat for my non-walkthrough, was there a couple of
screws that hold down the back part?? I remember someone telling me that you
didn't need any hardware to mount the front seats, but I see two holes that
look like bolts should be in them, but then again maybe somebody added this on
later??

Where can I get a very nice wiring diagram?? I got wires going every which way
and have no clue where they came from. I seen the one on www.vintagebus.com
but when i go to print it out i get lots of funny pages that don't match up.

sorry for all the questions, i'm sure after tommorrow i'll have a few more. I
just can't wait to get my bus back and going , it looks sooooo nice after it's
new interior paint job!
