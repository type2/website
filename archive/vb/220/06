Snap-On has an online store on their site.  I haven't used it, but it
seems to be fully operational.

As far as I know the salesmen handle the warranty exchanges.  I'd
assume that if you're a professional mechanic and you break something,
a call to the salesman gets you a replacement pretty fast.  That's part
of what you're paying for when you spend the bucks for "pro" tools.

Standard disclaimer: I don't work for any tool company.  I have mostly
Craftsman tools, with some Snap-on, Mac, Proto tools that I inherited
from my grandfather.  I've broken a few Craftsman tools, but I haven't
managed to break any of the "pro" tools yet.
