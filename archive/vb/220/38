stop by a local shop and ask the guys which day the snap on or mac guy comes
there.  then you can just catch the guy at his truck to buy or exchange
tools.  a good tool guy should be pretty consistent.  the mac guy comes to
our shop every wednesday at about noon and snap on comes friday at 3:30ish.
