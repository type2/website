Wow, guess I hit a nerve.  Thanks for all the replies folks.  Common
sense is common sense and I will use it and many of your replies to
alleviate any irrational fears.  My wife is a wonderful intelligent
person who, unfortunately, has never traveled significantly outside of
the US.  I know that once we get there all will be fine. 

Thanks again for all the responses.

Steve
