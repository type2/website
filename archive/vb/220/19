Bilstein, best basic shock you can get.  Also they last almost forever, so a 
longterm value if you plan on keeping your bus.

Koni if you are hardcore, but I cannot imagine a normal use bus needing 
these.

Check out www.shox.com for the best prices I have found anywhere on shocks.

But the KYB GR2 front and KYB Gas-A-Just rear is a decent cheap solution.

Later,
Adrian
