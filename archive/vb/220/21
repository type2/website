Subject: In L A area Monday/Tuesday

   Anybody going to be around Monday or Tuesday in the L A , So Cal area. I
am going to the docks on Monday/Tuesday to pick up my Aussie cargo van and
would like to visit or meet anybody if they are around.  The ship docks on
Saturday, so my van will be ready to pick up Monday. 
  P-mail me if it will work for anybody.

Monday AM)
