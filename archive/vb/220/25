  There should be 3 different profiles. If you got the seals with only 2
profiles the long one goes from beltline to belt line. When you install the
front post seal you will need to shim it out or it won't seal right. 
  What year bus do you have? If you want to get technical there are
different profiles of seals for different years of buses, with 1967 having a
one year only profile and 1963 to 1967 also has a different profile top
seal. WCM makes the best door seals in my opinion as they are all the 1967
style which VW  found to work the best.

I purchased new front door seals from The Bus Depot. There are 4 pieces,
2 long and 2 short. They are all square except for one of the long ones
is slightly rectangular. There seems to be extra material when putting
them on. So I called Bus Depot and they were no help, he actually
recommended The List. That was my back up plan any way. Can any one tell
me the proper placement of these 4 pieces? Where does the rectangular
one go?
Thanks!
