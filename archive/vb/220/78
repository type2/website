<< I just bought a 59 panel,with an excellent rust free Texas body .The rear
 end has been taken apart. It has the torsion bar and tube in place,but is
 missing the spring plates,covers,transaxle,etc...
   I have access to parts busses (56,61,65) with all necessary parts. What I
 don't know is :
 
 1.   Which year(s) of spring plates will fit my bar and tube, and which of
 these will work best in my application?
...................................
Any year 55-67 spring plates/covers would work.   they are the same.   You 
may have to mess around with setting the angle if the bar had been pulled out 
and put back in, so I'd definately check!!!!   I recommend buying new 
bushings from VWOA, and using talcum powder on them when installing the 
bushings.  Tell them you have a 69 bus, the bushings are the same and the 
computer doesn't go back to 1959.  This would hopelessly confuse them.

 2.  Apparently a big nut tranny will fit,but what if any mods will be
 required to make it fit and shift correctly.

the RGoxes bolt up w/o problems.   There is a e-brake cable issue I think, 
when switching teh little box bus to big boxes, .   

The main thing you will run into is putting a tunnel case tranny into a split 
case bus.  That is, if your 59 was a split case bus, they did the switch 
partway through the model year, at ~ chassis # 469 217 I think.   THe things 
is teh nose cones are different and so are the front mounts.   You cannot 
bolt a early nos eonto a later tranny as the bolt pattern and shape are 
difffernt.  If you have a split case bus it has a circlar thingy for the 
front bushing in the bus.   Then you need  to make are buy an adaptor plate.  
  I recomment using an old school rear shift coupler, the sandwich type.  If 
you use the later type the vibrations will come down the shift rod into the 
cab and you get to hear more tranny noise when driving.   

Your 56 would have originallly come with a split case, so you can compare.

 3.  Should I use 14" or 15" stock wheels,as I have both.   Advantages?
   I plan to use reduction boxes and keep this bus at stock height.

I'd use the 15".  Not only are tehy stock for the 59, you get more road speed 
per turn of the motor.
