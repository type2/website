Hello VB folks,

It's been a while since I made any contribution to the list. I've been on the 
digest mode for a long time and then unsubscribed due to being on the road. 
We're on the road still, currently in Washington D.C., and will swing back 
west sometime soon.

I would have remained 'underground' like the groundhog this year, not 
surfaced to greet the day, except I finally have time to catch up on the VB 
mails in type2.com and found the SOS message sent out by Ronnie and kind 
words from fellow bussers. One cannot hide behind the screen when kindness is 
bestowed upon him... So here I am to thank you all publicly. Also I thought I 
should include a link to my journal entries, for those of you interested, to 
share my passage in the split-window bus. 

Sorry this was not done on a Friday. For techicality's sake: Like Beto said, 
a '71 auto-tran Bug starter moter works just dandy in the '66 bus. 

My sincere thanks to all who volunteered to help or chipped in 2 cents. Keep 
on bussin'...   
"No bitching unless it's bitchin'!!"
