Subject: Gas tank install question.

Hello list,

I'm about to install the gas tank back in my '56. I've got the seal that
goes around the outlet but I'm not sure what to use under the tank and
between the straps and the tank.  The pieces that were there look like they
might have been felt but they were so oil soaked and squashed it's hard to
tell what they were originally.  What's everyone use under and around the
tank when reinstalling?

TIA
