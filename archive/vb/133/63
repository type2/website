Subject: Heater cable lengths

We are here in Las Vegas but find we have a slight inconvenience.  We
are driving the 58 single cab on it's maiden camping trip in which we
installed a new heater cable.  We have fresh air heater boxes and old
crash box tranny.  It appears the cables are not long enough.  We are
getting some heat through even when they are 'shut off' cable wise.  Not
a lot of heat but more than we need in Las Vegas at 110 deg.  We have
them adjusted all the way out to the tips.

We installed a similar setup in our 59 double door walk-thru and they
shut off just fine.  Only difference is has a later big nut tranny.

Ideas?  Are there different Type II length cables?  Would the tranny
make the difference in the length?  (we doubt it)

Other than that the truck is running fine and we made a nice trip in
averaging just over 41 mph.   Not back for the slow pokes :)

Relaxing by the pool hoping it cools down enough to cruise the 58
through town.
