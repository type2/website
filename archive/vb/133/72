First off, I agree with Steve.  For Vegas in July, just unhook the 
cables and let the return spring hold the flaps closed.  Having said
that, page M-11 5 of the Bentley shows the lever on the side of the
heater box with two holes for the control cable - one all the way out
at the end for the "new lever heater control" and one about an inch
closer to the pivot for the "former rotary knob heater control".
The new lever kits I have seen only have the hole out near the end.
Moving to the upper hole (or drilling one) will only gain you about
0.5"/13mm but it may be enough.

>Are there different Type II length cables?

There are/were five different ones.  On the ones with two lengths
listed, the longer one goes to the right heater box.

Part
Old            New            Length        Begin       End
211 715 541    211 711 607    2978/2963 mm  beginning   20-014 684 (Jun '51) 
211 715 541 A  211 711 607 A  2891/2887 mm  beginning   20-014 684
211 715 541 B  --             5750 mm       20-014 685  20-117 901 (Mar '55)
211 715 541 C  211 711 629 A  5735 mm       20-014 685  20-117 901
--             211 711 629 B  5715 mm       20-117 902  first bays

At a guess, you got the 5715 mm one and you need the 5735 mm (10 mm
more each side) or 5750 mm (17 mm more each side) one.
