Subject: Re: [VB] I stink at bondo

Have you progressed to the thinner "bondo" from the tube? There is a
product, and I can't think of the name right now, but instead of the big,
bulk can of Bondo, comes in a tube and is a whole lot more workable for very
small dents and dings. Ask your auto paint store for it, It won't be at Home
Depot.

I found that even though I applied tons of Bondo onto the bus, after sanding
and finishing I left almost none on. The work and art is not in putting it
on, it's in taking it off.
