Check out this months Car Craft magazine (might not be on the shelf yet
since I got it on Saturday in the mail).  They have a pretty good article on
the Jet Hot coating services.  They coat the inside and outside of the
headers and it basically drops the radiant temperature by half.  

Exhaust wrap is not a wise choice for a DD, leave it for the racers who
regularly change it.  

One of these days when I splurge for a whole new heat/exhaust system I plan
on getting it Jet Hot coated.
