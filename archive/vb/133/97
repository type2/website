Subject: RE: Roof Rack Clamps

Hope I can describe this clearly--

I saw this on a roof rack and it works great--Locate some very tough
steel--cut your piece about 2" long and about 1" wide--put a slight bend in
the middle--place this against the leg of the roof rack with the end Over
the rain gutter--with the bend Into the leg of the roof rack.--Drill a hole
through the clamp And the leg together--then place a nut and bolt through
the hole and tighten--This really looks very NEATO,  and it is so small you
hardly see it--But it works VWonderful on all roof racks--The one I saw had
the pieces of steal dipped in a rubber coating--to prevent scratching or
rust--The beauty of theses "clamps" is that they are just about 2" in
length,and about an inch wide-- so you can hardly see them--Trust me --they
really hold the roof rack on!! I could not move the rack at all!!, TWWM, uj
