Subject:  Barney sunroof mechanism same as later?

Greetings All,

Question for those in the know.  Is the sunroof
mechanism (bows, header bow, guide rails etc)
in a barney the same as in a later 55-67 bus?

I can't see any obvious reason to think they're
diferent on looking at the parts lists but 
a good source has told me they are 'different'
and the later bits 'don't fit well' ...

So, I'd really like to know before I pay out
for a later mechanism on the assumption it will work...

Thanks

RobK
