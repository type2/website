Subject: Re: [VB] paint stripping?

Rattlecan paint can usually be removed by rubbing it with a rag with a lot of laquer thinner on it. If the coat is very thick, this can take awile as you are actually dissolving layers of paint.

Problem is, the OG paint is probably enamel which could also dissolve. However, the OG paint is mixed with hardener and doesn't go into solution as easily as non-hardened rattlecan paint.

When you are rubbing, stop as soon as you see your OG paint appear. The next step you take depends on what you plan to do when you have exposed the OG paint.
