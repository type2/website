Subject: bumpers and such.


im trying to find the bumper with those guard thingys. i forget what 
theyre called. but theyre the generic 60's bumpers. with the pipe things 
on top. And, has anyone ever made their rear fenders back to normal? 
some tard in the 70's cut the rear wheel wells (big suprise) but i want 
them back to normal, would i be replacing a whole panel or what? (please 
don't say "what")
