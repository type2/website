So a couple of years ago I needed a spare so I bought a 15" rim from a =
guy in Winnipeg.  It had a very old tire on it that was holding air so I =
put it behind my seat for a spare.  It always bothered me because it was =
old and .... maybe unsafe.  I had 205/75/15's on my bus - not LT's but =
rated for 1585 lbs so .. I figured good enough - and they handled ok - =
except when I was dancing in the wind.  Anyway - I got new front tires =
today and put the best one (of the two they took off) on my spare. DAMN. =
With a 205/15/75 behind my seat not only does my the back of my seat not =
go all they way back - but - when I lift the seat to access the tool =
compartment - the seat bottom does not go up nearly as well as it did =
when I had the old tire. This sucks.  The 205's got to be at least 2" =
wider than the old tire.=20
