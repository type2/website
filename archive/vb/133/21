Subject: Re: [VB] Singlecab roof rack anyone?

You can make one if you desire. I took a 3/4 "late" style rack cut it in the
middle and welded it back together to come up with the Single Cab rack I ran on
many of my Single Cabs. Here's a couple old pictures of it from Everett's
site................

Late Bus racks are alot easier to find than Dormobile racks.
