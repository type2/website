Sounds like a heater box issue.  Try adjusting the heater box connection so 
the heat goes off, and when you turn the knob it goes on.    It could be that 
then the heat would only come on halfway, and your throw is too short.

the arm on the heater box the cable barrel clamp holder attaches to has a 
couple sites.  Well some of them do.- either further down the pivoting thing 
or not as far down. 
 If your arms doesn't, you can get another that does, and replace it while 
motor is in the bus.  There are just some circlips to undo to take the arm of 
the heater box, no big deal.

 You can undo the circlip that holds the piece the barrel clamp is held by, 
and shift it down the arm.

I had to do this when I swapped motors in my 65, the second motor the heat 
didn't come on all the way till I futzed with the heater box arms.  I think 
it may be a bug thing?
