Subject: re:paint stripping

I hae heard using a buffer might work-anywy that is what a friend of mine
suggested when he gave me an old squareback that someone had done this
(terribel rattle can job over the hwol vehicle).

Another option might be to try one of those clay bars things-you should be
able to get this at a good body shop store-just use lots of water with it.

i have not tried either of these - just heard about them so i dont know from
experience...

lol
