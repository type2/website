Hi James,
Been done!  Check out old issues of "Foriegn Car Guide".  Tin modification 
will be needed.  In the end you will have a higher HP engine than stock, but 
not the low end torque a bus really needs.  For all the trouble and $$$ you 
would do better to invest in converting a 1700, 1800 or 2000cc type 4 engine 
and install FI.  Which has the low end torque, and 200,000 to 300,000 mile 
longevity if maintained properly and not run regularly at WOT.
