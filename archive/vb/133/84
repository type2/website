     I'm hoping you might know of a VW shop that replaces engines or works on vangon's (I have a "83" vangon camper). I was told by a VW dealer in Auburn calif that I might have sucked a valve and that I should replace the engine, checking to see if it did damage to the block would cost almost as buying a new engine. I had to leave the van in Citrus Heights calif (I live in Fresno, cal). I hope you might know of a good shop in Citrus heights or Sac, Fresno etc. 
                                       THANKS 
                                        Terry

PS
 This is a seach for honest VW mech by a newbie VW own
