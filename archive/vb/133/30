Subject: insulation?

i want to put the stock panels on the inside of my bus, (well, i guess i 
mean stock for a standard, since i have a kombi, and they didnt have 
panels right?) but i want to make the inside look nice...is there some 
sort of insulation? or would i be using the same padding i would be 
using under my carpet?
