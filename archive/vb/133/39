Subject: New family member-a fastback.

I had planned on working on the trailer, and just checking things up on
the bus for July 4th camping (Bus content), plus get the new door panels
ready for the ghia vert on Sat....But, the other half found an ad that
read..."Estate Auction" <insert collectible Hummels and glassware BS
here>... "72 Type 3 Karmen Ghia(sic)".
I'm thinking it's a Ghia, BOT a t34 ghia, and the usual NE rust bucket,
so I am hestiant to go...Preview at 9am, so I race down to the town and
see this thing.
I find a 1972 orange (always wanted an orange one) FASTBACK, with 30K on
the clock. Rust on front fenders(got fenders?), perfect everywhere else,
interior, down to dealer vw stickers in the side windows,  which I
THOUGHT were supposed to be popouts, but weren't. IS this eurospec? 425
bucks later, she's mine. Snag an old tool kit plus OG tool kit both
complete.
Well, I tug this thing home tonight, with the ultra pricey to fix FI
system, and no brake fluid, and stuck rear brakes, due to auctioneer
snagging them up after all that sitting (PHUN).
All please wish me luck when I spray the cyls down and hope to turn her
hand, and even more luck to fire up the FI after I get her turning and
pumping air (hopefully).
If there are any t3 peoples here with some hints, please feel free to
shoot.
*This will be the only post here about the car, since it's NOT a bus. Is
the t3.org list active?
Not my bus, but a neato VW.
