I'm sure you'll be happy with it. But for applications like the floor of a
bus or sealing a surface that's out of sight, the epoxy material takes much
more abuse than the polyurethane. I've seen the polyurethane chip off, tear
off, or form air bubbles under it. But chances are you'll be ok. If I were
resurfacing the floor of my bus or the pan of a bug, I would use epoxy.
Line-X looks nice though.
