Subject: Re: [VB] I stink at bondo

Hi-build or filler primer goes a LONG way to helping bondo jobs. Use 
the bondo to get as good as you can. Don't expect perfect. When you 
apply the hi-build primer and block sand, you'll be able to see what 
needs to be sanded down and what needs more build. The primer should 
be enough to finish the job. Maybe a few more sprays and block 
sanding. In the end, you'll never know there is bondo.

I didn't do this step on my '59 Kombi and it showed. I've been doing 
it on my wife's '70 vert and it looks flawless afterwards.
