By far the best information you can get is through the bulletin board. 
Ask any thing you want...the guys there are pros and Len (site owner) is
prompt with his answers.  The prices for stuff is reasonable (especially
if you are on the right coast).  I've learned a bunch from just reading
his site and buying the video he has.  I need to get a good video on
metal shrinking/streaching and possibly hammer welding to round out some
mediocre skills. 

BTW I'm not affiliated with them.
