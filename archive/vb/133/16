I was looking at my almost completed bus and I am rather pleased with all the 
views of the bus, side shot etc...but the front is in need of a little 
sprucing up.  So does anyone make or sell a set of chrome wiper arms?  Also I 
am looking for the little round year plates  1959, 1960 etc..that mount to 
the bumpers.
