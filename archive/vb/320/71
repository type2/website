Subject: Re: [VB] Two trips, not enough gears! (a littl long) / trip

bummer!!!!

FWIW, I just got back from BYOB/ Kelley Park.    Tranny still has all its 
gears, though I think shifting into 3rd is a tad sticky .   Todd Hill rebuild w/ 
~ 25K ??? on it

Stopped at the hotsprings last night on the way back, drove ~350 miles today. 
  Only bus problem was running out of gas 3 miles before the exit I was 
planning to take to get gas (had a can in the bus) For some reason reserve didn't 
work.  I did look at the rear brake shoes and adjust and bleed the brakes in 
CA, brakes really did need adjusting.  Anything to do w/ the mountains?   nah.

Oh, I didn't go to Crater Lake, but I heard there's 28 feet of snow up there, 
and a hole cut in it for you can climb up and see the lake through it.   Now 
that SNOW would be worth seeing

about 2100 miles round trip.   Did add 1/2 qt oil.

Great seeing you JP, and all the other listees who were at the shows last 
weekend

Other than the price of gas and teething problems with
my new stroker motor, I lost a gear on each of two
transmissions on each trip!
