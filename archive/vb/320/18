I'd say, take the plug back out of the throttle plate (replace either the
throttle plate or the carb if you drilled it out larger to fit a rivet) and
install a vacuum dizzy. The 009 is killing your mileage, you can gain 3-4
more mpg with an SVDA.

My 64 bus, stock gear ratio's, stock size tires, got 24 1/2 mpg at 65mph,
and was able to hit 27 3/4 mpg at 60mph. This is highway mileage.  I never
measured city.
