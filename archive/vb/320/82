If the oil circle plate is off... you can poke your pinky in the engine and

but I don't understand the question... i mean.... if the case is stripped at 
a stud... it'll be really loose.   and so be clear which stud it is.     Don't 
fix it if it ain't broke.

Hardware store downtown.  (Oly Supply) has step studs for VW oil sumps.  They 
have lots of cool stuff.   

Hi all - In my last step to chasing down oil leaks  in my H case 1500 
sp, I need to replace a stud with a step stud 8mm to 6mm, just want to 
make sure I get the right length.  After pulling the motor to replace 
main seal, oil cooler, set valves, etc, this is my smallest job, but in 
reading the archives, it seems there might be one stud that's longer to 
hold down the pick-up tube, but according to E&B this didn't start 
until 1970.  I just want to be sure I don't remove THAT stud, if it's 
even there
