Use the KISS principle. Keep It So Simple or some
such variation on the wording ;)

Plywood with a pair of vertical 2x4's for the
wheels and some straps to hold them steady. Just
lay the plywood on the bed, load the bikes, tie
them down to the sides.

You can take the whole thing out anytime, no holes.
