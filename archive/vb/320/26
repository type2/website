Hi Eric,
It was a replacement used tranny from an early 1960s bus for our 1960 bus.  
That is the gearing we figured it had!  (Interestingly our 1963 SC which we are 
pretty sure had its factory tranny had the same RPM and MPH gearing!)
  This replaced the tranny that came originally to us in the 1960 walk thru 
panel camper conversion we got for free with the 1600cc DP engine in the cargo 
bay with #3 rod sticking out of the top of the engine case.  When we got the 
1960 panel (AKA Nermal cause this bus had so much that was not normal) running 
with a big bore 40 HP engine Eric built and could not get the panel up over 45 
MPH with the gas pedal to the metal in fourth gear.  When we put the tach in 
we found that fourth hit 3,000 RPM at 35 MPH!!  We figured that the 1600 DP 
must have been doing at least 5,500 RPM just to do 55 MPH which was the national 
speed limit of the time!  No wonder the rod ended up though there when the 
piston siezed in the cylinder.....
