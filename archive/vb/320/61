Subject: Re: [VB] ENGINE NUMBERS

Hi Mike,
You ignore the number on the generator stand because it can be unbolted so it 
could be from anywhere.  The engine ID number is below this stand stamped on 
the engine case so it can not be seperated.  As for wether the engine is still 
a 1500, 1300, 1600, 1641, 1776, on can only tell by autopsy!
