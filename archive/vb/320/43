Hi Lee,
Not really because the slots for the gearing are not paper thin.  So you most 
likely are just barely slipping into the left side of the third & fourth 
slot.  If you replaced the hockey stick with a new one it might have the set screw 
hole drilled slightly to one side or even bent.  
  There should be some left to right adjustment at the shifter base.  You 
might have to ovalize the holes in the floor to allow for some adjustment that 
way.  Do you have the reverse gear lock out plate set in there correctly?
