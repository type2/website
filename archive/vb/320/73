Search The Samba gallery with the submitter name ToolBox and you will see
the solution you need. This has been used in many of my trucks VW or

I am new to the vintage list, but have been on the 68+ one for some time.
Today I pick up my new '60 Single Cab and hopefully this weekend will be my
first outing in it. My question involves ways to carry two mountain bikes
with me to the mountains. I've seen images of Single Cabs with bikes
standing in the bed before, and I'd like to do the same but I would do
almost anything to avoid drilling holes into the bed to mount the bike
chocks!
I've considered attaching fork mounts to some heavy-duty magnets and
sticking them to the bed, but I can see lots of potential problems with
that. Has anyone on the list carried bikes in unusual or creative ways that
might be of interest?
