Why not just take a piece of steel strap  that runs the width of the bed
and drill holes in it to screw to the original tilt holes. You could
then easily fabricate a mount off of that to accommodate a Yakima or
Tule fork lock. Additionally you could add screw locks over the tilt
screws to ward off would be bike thieves
