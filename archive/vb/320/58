Subject: Re: Sacramento Parts Sources?

Thom broke down to ask:
>> Anyone know of a VW parts source in the 
Sacramento area, other than BugFormance? <<

Is Victory Auto Parts still in business?
On a wild hunch, try Tognotti's, they cater
to the muscle car crowd, but they might carry
them for the VW racing crowd.

If not, Part for Imports in Grass Valley
is sure to have one. 530-272-3477

I'm not heading in to the office probably 
until Wednesday, but if you can't find one 
by then, call PFI, place it on hold, and I'll 
get it and bring it on down to you.
