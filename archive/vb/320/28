Subject: Re: [VB] Early shifter, late tranny

Hi Lee,
Sounds like you need to move the base of the shifter a bit to the left to get 
first and second in the correct place.  If that does not do the trick your 
front and/or rear  shift linkage couplers might have thier holes drilled off 
center or the square headed bolts in these are loose due to not being safety 
wired properly!  The early shift linkage if in good condition and maintained will 
work just fine with the later transmission.
