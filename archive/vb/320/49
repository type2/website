Subject: Sacramento Parts Sources?

The pressure plate in my panel broke yesterday, need to get a new one
ASAP, as the bus is my primary means of transportation right now.

Anyone know of a VW parts source in the Sacramento area, other than BugFormance?
Pozzi's went under back in December :(

Thanks.

Thom
