Subject: Re: [VB] Tie Rod fun!

Undo the nut that is either a castle nut (oem style) or a non castle nut.  
Hey read the idiot book by Muir. You take the ends out of the round bits that 
poke off the spindles.   the nonadjustable is a unit ... some new ones use 
adjustable for that side -- set it to the length the old one was and there it is.  
Don't over torque the nuts when installing!!!!!!

You set the toe in with the side that comes adjustable.

On the adjustable side ... you can replace just one end if you like.  I've 
never bought new ones as I have a bunch of good used ones from parts buses.

Well the left side tie rods are easy at least :)

The right side (no adjustments) is completely baffling to me.

The right side tie rod ends look pressed or crimped into the tie rod.  How 
do the old tie rod ends come out?  Also it appears that there is no threads 
to screw into?
