Subject: Rear Camber Angle-

Group-

I've seen pictures with lowered buses where some have severely angled (camber)
rear wheels and some look mostly straight (up-down).  What's making the
straight ones straight?  IRS?  Lowering technique?

Thank you very much,

PS- Still looking for a split, double cab in "medium" shape for $4-5k.....
