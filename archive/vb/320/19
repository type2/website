Rocco,
	What's the compression ratio in your new rebuilt engine?  Motors 
with CRs less than 7-1 get slightly less miles per gallon.  The advice 
to time the thing at 10* btdc makes me think that it has low cr.  Try 
increasing the advance a tad and see if that helps.  Works for me with a 
6.6-1 cr 1600 sp....   Gary Gibson
