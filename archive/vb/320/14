Subject: poor gas mileage

Hi folks,

I recently installed an engine built by Bob Donalds (runs great, couldn't be happier, by the way) and set the timing for my 009 to 10deg. BTDC as per his instructions, which are described on his website. The engine is a DP 1600. I transfered over the 34pict3 from my original motor, as well as the 009 distributor. I blocked off the hole in the throttle plate but I didn't change the jet and don't know what is currently in there (I ass-u-me it's stock jetted). 

The problem is that I'm only getting 18 mpg which can't be the best I can do  in a '64 kombi. I've been doing a fair amount of city driving balanced with a roughly even amount of 45-55 mph cruising at a rate of (-at-) 180 miles per week; I don't maintain speeds above 55. I've also been using high grade gas. 

I've been considering a switch to a SVDA distro, as listed at aircooled.net, based on my research of the type2 archives. I'm hoping this will cure my bus's gas-guzzling. 

What reasonable mileage can I expect with the combination of parts I have?

Any thoughts as to other causes of poor mileage?

I'll be calling Bob tomorrow for his thoughts, but I thought I'd get the opinions of you fine folk as well. As a skulking list member, I value your experienced thoughts. With gas prices as they are and a six-month-long roadtrip weeks away, I really need to do something.

Thanks in advance,
