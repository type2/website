Craig, I had Jerry cut the front main bearing boss and the seal area
while the case was torqued to make sure the seal area was round. Sure
enough he got 1-2 thousands off of one side.

as promised (threatened?), here is a pic of the weird oil ooze
pattern on the crapcase. never seen one like it before:

not as clear as i'd hoped, but you can make out that the left side
(FIF) of the case is wet; the right side is bone-dry aluminum except
for the lower 1/4.
