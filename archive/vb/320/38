Subject: stereo install under dash

im putting a cd player in the split this weekend and want to know how y'all 
have hung them from the dash tray. i dont want to lose the space and put it 
in it. anyone have pics? i searched thru the archives and didnt come up with 
much... except this funny clip from Matt Roberds from 2002 regarding 
switching to 12 volt. hee hee hee...


"12 V is a slippery slope.  At first you do it because you want your engine
to turn over better.  Then, you notice you can install a big sound system.
Oops - stereo might get stolen - better add a car alarm.  Of course with
12 V you can plug your cell phone and laptop into the Bus so you can work
wherever you go.  Near the end, you start installing neon tubes and LED
tailpipe tips.  Finally, your alternator blows up and you decide to take
the final step and trade off the Bus for a D-dg- C-r-v-n.  So stay with
6 V.  :)"
