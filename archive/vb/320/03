I've had severl people bring me motors with the oil pressure relief
piston stuck in the tube BECAUSE they improperly jammed the big
screwdiver into it and distorted the piston jamming it against the
walls. I have been using a factory style removal tool since 83, shortly
after I did this!

You need the super big fat screwdriver.   I have one that used to have
wood
on each side of the handle and fits the slot properly.
