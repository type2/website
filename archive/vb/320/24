I was concerned about my mileage in my 60 a few years ago.  Eric and Barb
posted a message like the above back then.  So ... I just started to drive
more carefully - not accelerating from stop signs etc.  I thought about
keeping the rpms down but I did not use a tach.  My mileage went from about
18 mpg imp to between 29 and 31 mpg imp.  Sometimes I was even getting like
33 mpg imp.  I've got a big bore 40 hp engine with a 28 pict carb.
