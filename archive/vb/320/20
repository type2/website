Subject: Early shifter, late tranny

So I've installed the later tunnel tranny in my 57 and I have been
driving arounf ok, but their doesn't seem to be any gate for 1st and 2nd
gears.  In other words if I push the stick over to the right hand side
3rd and 4th are sweet, but if I push over to the left side then it won't
go forward - only if I kind of set the stick somewhere between hard left
and hard right then I find 1st and 2nd. Reverse is ok.

So I guess the questions are should I be fitting the later shifter and
presumably front section of the linkage ? of is it just the floor plate
below the stick shift which governs the 1-2, 3-4 lateral positions of
the stick ??

if you know what I mean : |
