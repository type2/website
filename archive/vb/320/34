I'll have to look for one of those. I'm also gonna consult the engine's
builder to find his recommended jet sizes and order new ones to make things
easier. 
 Any suggestions for a 1600 dual port with 6.9-1 compression, a 009 distro
and a 34pict3 timed to 10 BTDC as per builder's recommendation?

Uhhhh, no.  I swapped my parts from the dead engine to the new longblock
using Tom Wilson's "How to Rebuild Your Volkswagen Air-Cooled Engine". That
tidbit wasn't specified. I'll check that as well.
