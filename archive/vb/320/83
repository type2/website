Subject: Remove Cooling Fan

Anyone have any tips on removing the fan from the generator?  I followed the
Muir instructions:  generator on table, fan hanging over side vice grips on
shaft, turn big nut counter clockwise.
This just resulted in gouging the metal on the shaft as it turned inside the
vice grips.  Ugggg.
Any insightful tips appreciated!
Mike
