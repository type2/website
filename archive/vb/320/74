All the A cases (AE, AF, etc) are the better alloy & dual oil relief,  this 
is good.  Some have the thin studs with factory case inserts.  which is also 
better than the regular studs.   The later adual relief alloy is what I want as 
it is sturdier.  the earlier alloy is much more prone to warpage in event of 
overheating.   

 The tag might have been because of who knows what...maybe the bus was 
registered to the engine # when the replacement motor was installed, and that was 
the original motor nummer.    so you have a 70s replacement case... probably a 
1600.   

definately check end play and compression before buying the motor.  read the 
muir idiot book if that doesn't make sense.

a metal Volkswagen factory tag showing a letter H and then a six digit serial
number. Thats correct for about a 1964 or
1965 model 1500  (I think)   But, on the engines generator pedestal, the
serial number given is different.  There's
the letters,   "A  S"    then the six digit number. I'm confused by these two
sets of numbers. Is this indeed a 1500
and what set of numbers should I go with? I'm leaning toward the ones on the
pedestal. However, whats up with the  "A S"
letters in the serial number?  I don't have a listing for that.  Can someone
set me straight?
