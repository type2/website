Hi Josh,
Cool!  Those knobs were a 1967 only item.  Later knobs look the same but have 
the "D" shaped shafts.
  the bands say 5 (with a little 4 next to it) 7 9 11 13 15 16. so i guess 
its AM? 
Correct!
does anyone know how to hook it up in my 67? 
Would be nice to have a description of the wiring you have, but it should be 
simular to other dealer raios of the era.  One black wire is positive and 
should have a fuse holder on it, and the two paired wires coming out somewhere 
else from the radio are speaker wires.  Ground is by bolting to the metal of the 
body of the radio, and the radio antenna is plug in is self explanitory when 
you look at the anntenna plug.  Once the radio is working you tune in a station 
up in the 1400 thru 1600 range that is weak of signal.  There should be a 
slot tipped knob or a hole with a slot tip adjustment on the forward (FIF) end of 
the radio.  Turn this adjustment till the weak signal radio station is at its 
strongest and enjoy!
