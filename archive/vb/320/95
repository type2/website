The sound is very clear but dull, heavy, metallic in nature, with a
slight ring to it. Like it's inside the engine, not outside. It's
perfectly regular and repeats very fast; metallic knocks repeating very
quickly, like a machinegun, whenever the engine is in the low 2000's rpm,
going up or coming down. This is all in the driveway, not on the road.
