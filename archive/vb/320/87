Subject: That ballsy rattle!

Yo, group!

I went out to start the engine up this morning; it's been a little while,
as I've been taking public transportation to work last several months.
Engine started right up, but after warmup, I revved it several times, and
as it de-revs down from 3000 or so, as it's going thru the low 2000's,
there's this unmistakable ballsy rattling. When it gets into low rpms at
idle, it sounds great, no problems. When I rev it slowly, it rattles
around the low 2000s again. Disappears at higher revs, and at idle.
There's a bit of a delay as it starts rattling when I'm coming down from
high rpms. This is all with bus in driveway, not on the road.

The first thing comes to mind is loose connecting rod bearings and such.
What's the consensus on this?

TIA,
cal
