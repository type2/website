Subject: ENGINE NUMBERS

Hi Folks,
Got a question, hoping someone can help me. I have an opportunity to get a
spare engine
for my bus. The current owner says it's a 1500. While checking it over I
noticed on the fan housing theres
a metal Volkswagen factory tag showing a letter H and then a six digit serial
number. Thats correct for about a 1964 or
1965 model 1500  (I think)   But, on the engines generator pedestal, the
serial number given is different.  There's
the letters,   "A  S"    then the six digit number. I'm confused by these two
sets of numbers. Is this indeed a 1500
and what set of numbers should I go with? I'm leaning toward the ones on the
pedestal. However, whats up with the  "A S"
letters in the serial number?  I don't have a listing for that.  Can someone
set me straight?
regards,
Mike Turner
