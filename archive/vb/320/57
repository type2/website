Subject: RE: stereo install under dash -- PLUS theft control

I took an old Pioneer supertuner 8-track tape player and gutted the
insides. I then hinged the front face to fold up and down. I installed a
CD player on the inside and mounted it under the dash with the original
"u" braket. Now I just flip the face down on the 8-track and play my CDs
or listen to the radio.
 When I am all done I flip it back up to look like a "worthless to
steal" 8-track tape player.
