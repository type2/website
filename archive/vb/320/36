Subject: oozy crapcase

as promised (threatened?), here is a pic of the weird oil ooze 
pattern on the crapcase. never seen one like it before:
http://www.ckoon.org/vw/frontseam.jpg
not as clear as i'd hoped, but you can make out that the left side 
(FIF) of the case is wet; the right side is bone-dry aluminum except 
for the lower 1/4.

the oil goes from 12 noon to 7 oclock. like a knife edge. now, if the 
FW seal was leaking, i'd expect it to be throwing oil ALL around the 
area, right?  i can't even see where the physical structure of the 
case would interfere w/ that.

i do suspect the allen plugs weep, tho all but two (including the one 
on the right side ) were tight when checked. so that might account 
for some oil, but again, why the TOTALLY dry area on the upper right 
quadrant?

really, unless someone else sees an answer, either the case is 
weeping oil  - through - the metal  on the left side, or my case was 
made in amityville.
