That is the top of the line 8 track player.   I mounted one under the dash in 
my 61. 

  Anyone have Black Sabbath "Paranoid" on 8 track?

took an old Pioneer supertuner 8-track tape player and gutted the
insides. I then hinged the front face to fold up and down. I installed a
CD player on the inside and mounted it under the dash with the original
"u" braket. Now I just flip the face down on the 8-track and play my CDs
or listen to the radio.
When I am all done I flip it back up to look like a "worthless to
steal" 8-track tape player.
