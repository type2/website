Subject: Re: [VB] poor gas mileage

I'm pretty sure (fingers crossed) that this may be a big part of my
problem. Since getting the new engine, I've been very cautious about
lugging it. Although I haven't been gunning it,  I have been over revving a
bit to err on the side of over rev's rather than under revs. I've got to
hook up the tach and get to the bottom of this especially if a little bit
of free precision can save me a lot of gas money.
Thanks to everyone for your advice. I'll let you know the results asap.
