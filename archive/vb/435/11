Hi Kevin,
Yes, on the 69 only front transaxle mount, but VW moved the rear mounts to the
rear of the engine.

Yes, it could come and go if the FW gland nut needle bearings go bad.  If that
is the case you are probably damaging the tip of the transaxle and only way to
fix that is to have transaxle taken apart......

To help keep the needle bearings from failing, lightly coat the input shaft
about every 30,000 or so when you happen to pull the engine for other
maintenance.
