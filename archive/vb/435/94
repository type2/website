Subject: Re: [VB] Thrust washers?

Kevin,
	The little bump in the washer makes it easier to adjust the wheel  
bearings.  If the washer doesn't move or spin, it is easier to set  
the play. The "stop" on the washer helps but really is not even  
necessary, well sort of, the whole deal should not turn. Sounds like  
you may not be adjusting the bearings properly and maybe they are way  
too loose causing the rubbing sound? I like the St. Muir bearing  
adjustment ideas. Especially tightening the bearings down tight and  
then backing off so that the washer just begins to move. You will get  
it with practice.
	There is a chance that you need to replace the roller bearings and  
races? It is not possible to adjust the bearing when there is much  
wear in the race/bearing relationship. Try tighten up the spindle nut  
and see if there is still play?  If so, you need to replace the  
bearings and their races.
Good luck!  Gary
