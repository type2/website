Subject: RE: [VB] Thrust washers?

Hey Gary,

The washer doesn't spin around, but it does move a bit, maybe 15 degrees? It
just seems like a sh**ty repro, why they don't make that nipple longer I
don't understand, am I missing something? Maybe there is a reason I just
don't know.  I think if I had them manuf. I would over lengthen that piece,
as it is easy enough to file it down to fit.

Kevin, if the washer doesn't turn, spin around, when adjusting the bearings,
all should be fine.  Gary
