Interesting and sounds like good info,

I have to admit my ten years were spent mostly on the bay window 
years and I never found a way to remove those plungers. I never tried 
desoldering the wires. Sure would be nice if one could remove the 
plunger to polish out the worn groove for better than 200K miles per 
solenoid.

If it clicks (pulls in) but doesn't start then it may be the 
contacts. Might be time to pull out the pricey syringe of CAIG M260cP 
to coat the contacts if it can be opened up.
