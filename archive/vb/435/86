Hi Kevin,
Have not tried it yet, but if you have the early style of bases the spring
should be removable.  The 1967 wiper arm that the base and arm are not
seperatable is quite different and have not had any in our collection, so no
idea on those.  Either way when removing the spring wear eye protection so it
does not put out an eye.

Also check that the base pivot hinge pin areas have not worn out.

Hey E&B,

Thanks for the info/tips.

I will go check the springs on my wiper arms-are these something that you can
replace, or do you just replace the hole arm?
