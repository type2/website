I also have a 78 westy and an 82 westy - I never cook inside of either -
although I do boil water inside the 82. I have the kitchen and wardrobe
cabinets for an so?? (Kitchen behind the bulkhead in non-walkthrough) but I'm
not going to use it because I just don't cook inside. I figure a stove in a
cabinet on the door would be perfect for me. I'm also thinking about an icebox
or 12 volt fridge and water tank under a rear facing seat. I rpcampers so 33
but I want the bed over the engine bay - so I'm leaning for a modified so 44.
BUT I'm not 100% committed to anything and am open to suggestions. I do like
the Devon a lot but I want a real headbanger cabinet and don't think drawers
over the engine bay make the most sense.
