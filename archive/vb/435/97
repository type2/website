The rubber seals for the drums are a modern replacement of the metal ones.
wheel bearings should be cleaned and inspected at the 30k mile service.
brakes should be adjusted every 6k miles

link pins should be adjusted every 6k miles.   It is very easy.   You do need
to jack the bus up so the wheel are off the ground.   You also need a 17mm
open end wrench.   There are instructions in the bentley, and in the Muir
book.
I would grease the suspension every 6K miles as well.   if not at the 3K
miles.
  I like to loosen the link pin pinch bolt, pump some grease in, wiggle the
link pin back and forth a little to kinda squish the grease around, then
adjust it and snug the pinch bolt.

grease is good.

I have a page of service intervals I got from somewhere, printed out on my
garage wall.   I mean, the print-out is pinned to the garage wall, not that
the wall was directly printed upon.

there is info in the service booklets:

During this work, between reading Bentley, the list archives, the samba,
andall your responses, I realize I have never adjusted my link pins. I think

adjustedevery 6,000 miles. I have now had my bus for almost 60,000 miles.and
14years.I guess it is time. That should go onto my 'todo' list.is this is abig
operation? thanks for the tips. And keep on bussing. -Kevin GuarnottaJamaica
