Subject: RE: [VB] Starter or hot Start problems...

This is why I love the list, and was just bragging to some friends of my
wife about being a member this past weekend!

Thanks for the tips, I will try to accomplish them this week-I especially
like the Starter Maintenance-as I didn't even know this was a thing to do.
I'll add it to my list, maybe not every year, but every couple years. I also
agree with adding extra wires that were not there originally. I prefer to
keep it as simple as possible, it makes for better troubleshooting-then
again I did put an alternator in my bus in place of the generator, and
changed it from 6V to 12V...;)
