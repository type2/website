Subject: Thrust washers?

In the last week or so my bus started to make a bad sound when I use the
brakes. It sounded like a bad scraping of some sort or other. I thought it
was the front brake shoes had worn out, and they were scraping the drums. So
stopped driving it, and brought it into my garage. I planned on pulling the
front drums and check the brakes. I also figured I would re-pack the front
bearings, as I could not remember the last time I did that. (Ok just checked
my records, it was 8 years and 20,000 miles ago).

 

I took everything apart - and the brake shoes looked ok. I took the bearings
out of the drums, and the scraped/wire brushed the drums to clean them up. I
then painted them. (just the outside). The insides felt smooth, with no
visible scratches. I have cleaned up the bearings, and plan on repacking
them, and reinstalling. The bearings seem fine, and roll smoothly.

 

I did notice that one of the thrust washers little bump had broken off on
the passenger side. And I remember that when I installed it, the little
nipple did not seem adequate enough. I guess I was right. I compared some
new ones(I had from WW) to the one I had on my driver side. The driver side
one seems to be much better quality, and a much nicer fit. I have posted
pics comparing them here -

Are the new thrust washers poorer quality? Am I not looking at this
correctly? Next questions, after I put everything back together, if I still
hear the scraping-where should I look - I guess the rear drums, but the
noise sounds like it is coming from the front.

 

Thanks for any tips and advice.
