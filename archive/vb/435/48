I agree with Clara on diabolical grease, but recommend a hard start 
relay kit.
On my 62 and my 70 bay I used to regularly crawl out and use a stubby 
screwdriver to get the solenoid to activate. OK except when it is raining.
I even ran a second wire to a switch on the dash and that worked most of 
the time.
On my 73 Thing I added a hard start relay kit and the problem is truly 
solved.
I did a search on thesamba and found several sources for reasonable 
prices. I know it is insane and I should have just bought a relay and 
done it myself for 1/4 the cost, but what I did worked and is still working.
Here is a link to hard start kits.
