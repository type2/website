It's Friday Where is The Hubcap?

I hauled the hubcap and tour-box back in 1999 or 2000 and was curious
about the current whereabouts.I did a little digging in the archives
last night because I was telling my 10 year old daughter about the
Great bus tour hubcap. The last post I saw about it was from 2007,
Admin David R. was discussing hitching a ride with some guy named John
(me coincidentally) From Everybus to WV to pick up a V-gon. So what is
the latest on The Great Bus tour Hubcap, is it still MIA?
