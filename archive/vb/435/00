Hi  Volks,
Since it is Friday thought to post this.  Been wanting to put  up license
plates from all over N. America and beyond in our shop.  So  got any old 
spare
junk plates from your area??
We have lots of  Washington State license plates (with Mt Rainer in the
background or some  of the the older white and green) to trade or for 
harder to
get location or  older plates will pay for shipping and some $ if you are 
not
interested in  trades.
E&B
