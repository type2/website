Was that hole originally for a grease fitting?  Seems like my bus has
one so you can grease the shifter ball without taking it apart.  If
the hole is pretty big, it may be easier to weld a sleeve around the
outside rather than trying to fill it in.  Then you could drill & tap
a hole for a new grease fitting.
