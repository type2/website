Hi Otmar,
	The old school solenoids need to be taken apart to clean up. Like,  
de-solder the wires to the electrical connections, unscrew the top  
and the clean and maybe replace/clean the copper contacts. The later  
solenoids have a "fall out" plunger and the top is crimped with no  
screws. No easy entry. These can be repaired but you'll need to break  
into the crimp to fix the interior. The plunger will fall out once  
the solenoid is removed from the starter on "newer" VWs . That is  
easy to clean.  I've seen the later ones de-crimped and fixed. I  
suppose it does not need to be pretty.
	I think that Kevin's starter has a cruddy starter solenoid?  Gary
