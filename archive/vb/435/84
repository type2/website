Hi Kevin,
Rubber will degrade if not stored properly.  A cool dry storage area is much
nicer than a hot attic for rubber items.

How are your wiper base springs?  If weak that will not help the blades to
wipe properly.

Are the blades straight or did they get bent?  Check with a straight edge to
find out.

  If the arms are twisted the blade/s will not flop properly and the blade can
kind of pogo across the glass in one direction leaving almost all of the water
on the glass.
E&B




Do the blades age while in storage? The last ones I put on had been in
storage for a while, but protected from sunlight.
