Subject: pressure plate vibration

Just installed a new pressure plate and clutch and after a little test drive
noticed a vibration now.  All I changed was the pressure plate and clutch. 
It's not really bad but enough that I can feel it while driving.  It varies
with the rpm of the engine.  Just to be sure nothing else is to blame I
disconnected the fan belt and ran the engine for a couple minutes.  It
vibrates the same whether the clutch is engaged or not.

Any suggestions?  Do
I need to pull the pressure plate and clutch back out and have the pressure
plate balanced at a shop that does that kind of work?  Thanks for any tips.
