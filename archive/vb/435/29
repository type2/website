This is only a bit harder than doing brain surgery. do you have any 
experience in handling wool fabric, in tailoring? this stuff, the 
real deal mohair, has gotten very costly. I do not mean to 
discourage, in fact, I think if people were FULLY PREPARED FOR THE 
HORROR of such undertakings, they would manage to get it done.

what I am saying is this is hard the way it is hard to tailor a fine mans suit.
