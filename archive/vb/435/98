Subject: RE:Hard Shifting continues...

I just wanted to hopefully close out this thread.but the saga continues a
bit.

I had some time today. I took the singlecab over to the place I get my body
work done. The owner said he would help weld up the end of the clutch cable
tube.  I took the clutch cable tube/bowden tube apart. I removed the clutch
cable.

I took a short piece of aluminum tube, and put it over the section of pipe
that was cut. Then my body shop guy welded a washer to the end of the
tube(as the tab had been broken off). I also realized my clutch cable (which
appeared to be new, and installed by a previous owner, need to check the
records on that) was failing at the pedal connection. So I replaced the
cable.

When I pulled the original cable out of the bowden tube, a piece of plastic
tubing came out with it. Is this part of the bowden tube, that broke off?
I'm wondering if it broke out of the center of the tube because there was no
grease there originally?

Here are some pics of the repair work, and the bowden tube curve afterwards.
