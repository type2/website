I'm leaning towards custom too. I'm trying to think of some kind of
pole and rotating arm like the late bay/vanagon tables where the sink
and cook top could spin out from under the bench seats to use outside
like the sets that used to mount on the doors, or in inclement weather
be raised to work level inside. It's the whole issue of clear vs
inclement weather and cooking/cleaning inside the bus or outside the
bus.
