This is only a bit harder  than doing brain surgery. do you have any 
experience in handling wool  fabric, in tailoring? this stuff, the 
real deal mohair, has gotten very  costly. I do not mean to 
discourage, in fact, I think if people were FULLY  PREPARED FOR THE 
HORROR of such undertakings, they would manage to get it  done.

what I am saying is this is hard the way it is hard to tailor a  fine mans 
suit.
