Subject: wipers and arms

Hey guys,

 

Lots of rain up here in Boston. I used to just use lots of rain-x and rarely
use my wipers. When I do use my wipers, they generally just streak, and
don't really get the glass very clean. This is even after putting new blades
in. Do the blades age while in storage? The last ones I put on had been in
storage for a while, but protected from sunlight.

 

Any tips on wiper R&R?
