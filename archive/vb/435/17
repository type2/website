Subject: re:Steering damper bushing + Shift rod

Well I wrote in a couple weeks ago about my steering damper bushing. It was
shredded. I got a replacement, and was not sure if I needed to use a special
press to install it. I just thought I'd post what I did-which seems like it
worked.

 

Basically I took the metal sleeve out of the rubber bushing, and put the
bushing into the steering damper. Then I put the bolt that connects it to
the steering arms on, but I used a whole bunch of washer, and just basically
tightened the bolt, it pushed the metal piece into the center of the rubber
bushing. Seems like it worked, I didn't have time to test it yet, but it
looks good. 

 

Unfortunately while under there I noticed the shift rod had a hole rusted in
the bottom of it. I was wondering if there was a hole there originally, to
allow any water to drain out, and this hole has just enlarged? Suggestion on
repair to this? Should I just pull the rod, wire brush/clean it up, heavy
duty paint it, and re-install? What could have caused this? I also noticed
that the front beam looks super wet with grease/oil. Not sure where this is
coming from. See pics here -
