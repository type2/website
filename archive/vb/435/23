I'm going to bring some pics from Bentley, and from my camera to my body
shop guy and see what he says. He can probably weld something or other in
there. The zip ties are working-although I know they are only temporary. 

 

Thanks for the tip on taking the clutch cable out-I would not have thought
of that. I'll probably blow out the line at the same time, to get it as
clean as I can.
