Kevin, I might wonder (presuming the shoes were OK) mostly about the drum to
backing plate interface, which you have probably improved by the brushing and
painting.  Of course I do wonder a bit about the backing plate side of the
equation as well (warped, or interface area rusting) so look carefully for
contact there.  The final one would be if the drums have a real impressive
ridge (on either side though usually the inboard edge) that can rub on the
side of the shoes funny.)  That can obviously be improved by turning or in a
pinch just taking a grinder with a 40-50 grit flap disc to knock it down won't
usually affect balance and vibration THAT much.

I agree the little nipple is
sad on the one washer.  That of course is what keeps things from rotating and
backing out to some degree, so is necessary.  Was the adjustment on the side
that was broken still OK, not loose?  If it was loose, I'd replace the
bearings on that side if you think the front is the issue, regardless of how
they feel to hand.  To hand vs. loaded with several thousand pounds of dynamic
load at hundreds of rpm are way different of course.  If you friction weld one
bearing race to a stub axle (particularly on a 4500 foot mountain 20 miles
from nowhere in the middle of winter), you'll never question not replacing
when with the slightest doubt again.  That is obviously an ask me how I know
from my younger dumber years 20 years ago.
