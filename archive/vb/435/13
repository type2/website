Kevin,
	When the pilot/glant nut bearing goes, shifting is mostly bad.  
Especially once things warm up. Two years ago I had shifting  
problems, hard to get into first and then all gears and that turned  
out to be a bad pressure plate.  The clutch didn't slip but shifting  
was terrible.  I needed to see the old pressure plate next to a good  
one to see the problem.  The steel diaphram has lost its "spring".
