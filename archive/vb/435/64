Subject: Re: [VB] pressure plate vibration

Bummer, John. It does sound like something is out of balance or even  
has fallen off? Did you pull the flywheel, reset end play, anything  
like that? Seems like it would have to be something big out of whack  
in order to feel the vibration. Like, that flywheel is massive. Maybe  
the flywheel was at one time balanced and you didn't know to install  
it right if it came off?  Gary
