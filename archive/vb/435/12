-----Original Message------this is on my'69 singlecab. So I made some time
this evening to look at it.

4.        When I get the cable out, it looks brand new. Although
whomeverinstalled it, did not appear to use any lube, as it was very dry. I
went tore install it, with lube. It got stuck.I went back to check, and
apparentlythe tube it runs through had been cut at one point, and rejoined
with a hoseclamp. I'm not sure if this last bit of tube is supposed to be
welded to theframe, but it looks like there are a couple broken welds on
there.

lubing up the cable is always important.   :)  grease is good.

The clutch cable tube broken loose from the body can cause the clutch/
shifting to feel odd.   In a pinch sometimes you can take large hose clamps
and clamp the clutch cable tube back to the body.   I used a couple from the
swing axle tube boot slarge end to secure the clutch cable tube around the
rear torsion tube of a bus I used to have.

If it looks like the tube broke free, lie under the bus, and have a friend
push in the cluth and let it out while you watch for flex.  The tube should be
held securely in place.
