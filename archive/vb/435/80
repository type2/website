Subject: Nice blog

Take a look at this blog.
I met Mark on Friday night at a neighborhood car meet.
Lots of stuff other than VW's, however there were 5 buses, 4 splits 
and one bay, 2 very nice cabriolets and a couple other bugs as well as 
a nice dune buggy.

See Mark's blog at:

Quite the story driving from Florida to California in a very nicely 
restored bus!
Don't miss it!!
