Thanks for the tips so far.I think I'm making progress. 

 

I took the boden tube off, installed some washers in there, and reconnected
everything. I also tried to install the seal at the end of the boden tube.
There was no way that was going to last, it got shredded when I tried to get
the boden tube back in the bracket. Maybe I am putting this seal in the
wrong place. I had to heat it up in boiling water to get it to over the end
of the clutch cable. I think I now have the proper 'droop' in the boden
tube. Could someone take a look-and let me know if it looks right.

I posted some pics on Thesamba -

I also noticed that since the last bit of the clutch cable tube was cut, and
rejoined with a hose clamp-there also appear to be a tab missing from this
tube-based on pics I'm seeing on the web. I think there should be a tab
holding the tube to the body. I have zip tied it in place temporarily. Any
suggestions on welding a new tab back in place? I know a good welded in the
area, but he is not a vw guy, so I need to explain exactly what I need for
him to be able to do it. 

 

I also posted pics of this shift coupler. It looks ok to me-but it also
appears as though there was some sort of seal in place at one point, that is
no longer there.
