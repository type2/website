Subject: RE: [VB] Thrust washers?

Wow,
I was about to email them, and went to their site - and I saw the thrust
washer for the beetle, and the thrust washer for the bus. They are
different. I think the packages were mislabeled at WW. I think they took a
beetle washer, and labeled it as a bus washer. I'll let them know anyway....

Kevin,
Send the photo to WW. They might be interested in what a great washer looks
like.
