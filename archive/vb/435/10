Subject: RE: Hard shifting continues...

Was writ - "I've seen this happen when the rollers in the gland nut fall
apart.   

Hard to find any gear.  Also, a bad pressure plate can give these symptoms."

 

If one of these things happened, would the bus be good to shift sometimes,
but not others?

 

I'll try to get some washers on the boden tube, and look for the other
transmission mounts, but I thought on my '69 there was only the front mount?
Thanks for the pic of the shift coupler, I was not sure what that was. Now I
know what to look for.
