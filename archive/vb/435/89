My dad always told me to lightly hit the rubber blades with fine sandpaper to take off the hardened rubber on the outer edges of the blades. Rubber will age with cycles of heat, not only sun. It would have to be kept in constant humidity &temperature to prevent ageing. Don't happen to know the levels but if they were in a garage or attic, they would age. I'm assuming somewhere between 65 and 70Degrees farenheight and standard humidity would be needed, but there is still a halflife of the rubber that makes it start desinigrate or 'die' as soon as it leaves the assembly line. You can try to prevent this some with amorall or blackmagic while storing, &while installed on vehicle to prevent wear from ultraviolet rays. Any rubber conditioners should help, and some blades come with a booster gel in the package. The glass is flat so it will squeak like a chalk board anyways once the rainwater soaks out the conditioners, so you'll need to reapply after storms.
 Happy dubbing. 

Sincerely,
Aubrey James Allen
