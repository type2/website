ya, definitely when I did my 65 westy 5? years ago, it was a ton of work.  
Largely because I was figuring out wth I was doing.  I had friends who had 
painted before who helped out with sanding technique, and told me what to buy in 
terms of paint and mixers and wipe off the hand oil chemicals and all.  used PPG 
paint.   It turned out much much better than I expected, though there are 
plenty of little places where it could have had more attention to detail, I was 
tired of messing with it, just wanted a decent looking driver.   I learned a 
lot of appreciation for bodywork and painting!!!!  Also, you need all the 
friends you can get, find a buddy who has done it before to give you tips if you can.

 I *still* get people asking if it was just painted!!!  

pics on vintagebus.com   search  for "PIR"  It's the green/white bus with the 
roof rack.
