Subject: Jelousie window parts.

Hi,

I am looking for the rubber/vinyl strips that go at the top and bottom of
the jelousie windows. The lower strip contacts under the lower pane and the
upper one contacts the outside of the upper pane.

Anyone know of a source for replacement?

Thanks,
Chris.

PS. My bus is close to coming home after 9 months at the shop. It is looking
good!!
