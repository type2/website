Subject: Re: [VB] 60 single cab wheels Q

50 singlecab? That doesnt exist (according to the factory).
If you meant "50's" single cab, then it would have 16's if it was pre march 55. And 15's if it was
later 50's.
some post mar55's also have been seen og with 16's . 16's do have a "smoothie" appearance to them
unlike the 15's, but its the rim width that makes it a bus 16 as opposed to a bug 16.

 on it. Can someone tell me what is the correct size wheel for that year? I'm
 guessing 15 inches.
