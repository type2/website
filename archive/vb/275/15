Your absolutely right on the money here---

There is nothing more gratifying than to able to step back and
appreciate the fruits of your labor's--

And on the other hand--there can be nothing more frustrating thinking
about all time you have spent and have the paint job go to hell in a
short period of time.

This is why, I for one have always advocated using quality, higher end
refinishing materials--

The gratification process, will surely last a lot longer---:>)

RE: [VB] Re:Paintin' me bus
    Painting is a very tricky business and takes time and
patients. Lou has time and patience, as did Rex. Ricky Fu painted his
westy and it looks great. Lous bus looks like a pro shop did it.
    There is a whole list you can go down of people on this list
that have painted their own buses and they are all beautiful but there
are just as many that have PAID to have it done.
    My DD was pretty till the paint went to crap. Thom F painted
his yellow DD, Lou painted his Westy, Gene C painted his, Ricky Fu also
painted his own, SV2's did there own club bus. John VW/Harley Howard has
painted many a buses himself, Dawn from PLF oainted her highroof herself
and hasn't Clara painted a bus or 2 and I am sure there are a lot more
that have I didn't name.
    Yes it's nice to say I DID THAT, but sometimes time doesn't
allow it, so off to a shop it goes. That doesn't mean you can't still
take pride in your bus. Owning and driving a bus has enough pride in
it's own right.

ps. for a good look at home painting go/find the site of Gene Cornelias,
