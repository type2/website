So what sort of 12V armature did you put in it?   was it described as being 
for a 65 bus wiper motor?
My 65 that is also 12V , and have just been using a voltage drop.

It does have the original motor in it. I changed the armature because I am 
running 12 volts and as far as I kjnow you are right, it's a one year only 
motor. It does have three wires going  to it, brown black/purple and black. 
Black is hot with ig on, purple black is hot when you pull the wiper switch, 
and brown is ground.  I highly recommend bench testing before installing.  
Also, clean out the old grease and put fresh clean grease in, it will run quieter 
and smoother.  When I did this to my 61, the  old grease was like a plastic 
disc.   Before I regreased my 65's wiper motor, it just made a complaining 
noise and didn't move.  Works great for years now.

oh, after painting the bus,  I reinstalled the wiper motor and it didn't 
work.  Turned out there was paint where the frame grounds to the body, so I had to 
ran a jumper ground wire for a while.  It does need both grounds.
I looked in the Bentley and it appears to be the same diagrams that are on 
Vintagebus.
yes, there is an evil conspiracy against knowledge of 65 wiring.  However,  I 
usually find that the same colour wires for various years go to the same 
number connectors.   So try this out.
I'm also wondering if I installed the armature incorrectly and it's binding 
up in there. I 'll pull it tonight and see but I wanted to make sure the wiring 
is right too.
