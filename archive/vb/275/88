I've 'heard' that all bumpers were painted L82, but I can see on my bumpers,
that under the chipped paint that the PO sprayed on years earlier, that
there is the same L289 (BlueWhite) paint on the bumper as the upper color on
the body of my bus. I guess years ago someone could have stripped ALL the
paint off the stock bumper, sprayed the L289 paint front AND back, then some
years later, the bumper repainted cheaply a color very similar to L82, but
it does seem odd. You can see the chipped paint shows metal under the L289
paint. Backsides of my bumpers are still the L289 color.

I honestly think my 64 deluxe originally had bumpers the same color as the
top half of my bus. The WW website shows that the bumpers should be painted
L85 (but is called "SilverWhite", just like the L82). Is L85 similar to
L289? If so, that would explain it, but otherwise, it does seem odd. Anyone
local to me can check my bumpers for themselves to see what they think.
