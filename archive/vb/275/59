Subject: door seals

Howdy,
I am putting in new seals on my doors, cargo doors, and engine lid, and the 
seals all seem an inch or two too long. I figured I shouldn't cut them so I 
searched the archives and read you have to scrunch them up a little because 
they shrink later, which makes sense,  but I just can't seem to squeeze them 
together enough to fit them in at their present length. Is there some secret 
to this?

Thanks,
Wayne Carlisle
