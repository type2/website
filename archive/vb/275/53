Subject: rocker panel

I had someone weld in a new rocker panel on the right side of my 67 bus.Now 
the cargo doors won't close.The panel is to high and the bottoms of the doors 
hit. Does the panel need to be redone or how can I this this problem.I don't 
want the same person to work on this bus again. thanks
