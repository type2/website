Subject: Engine sounds

There is a sound that I usually relate to some old "beater" car.  Maybe a
car whose engine is too hot or low on oil or ???? It is a rattle like
sound.. metallic sound .. not a loud noise and really hard to describe, but
in any case I would hear it in OTHER cars but never in a VW .. well ... I
heard it in mine.  I had been driving for a while and I heard it in 3rd
gear.  I probably should have been in 2nd.  Strange I thought ..

ANY WAY .. the "mechanics from hell" said that my idle was NOT too high and
I disagreed [this was some time ago, I haven't been back] so I turned down
the idle myself .. the rattling .. ticking ... beater car sound went away ..
Think maybe my engine was too hot ? Maybe that sound can be compared to the
rattling lid on a pressure cooker ?? The sound is gone and my question is ..
do you recommend a cylinder head gauge ?? I had one on my 71 bus.  Of
course, the "mechanics from hell" disconnected it and said it wasn't needed
.. even when I told them to re-connect it they didn't ..  There is another
type of temperature warning "thing" that connects to the oil stick.  Makes
your oil and gen lights flash when the engine reaches a certain temp.  I
LIKE IDIOT LIGHTS .. I check my oil once a week when I fill up so it isn't
low oil that concerns me, it is a hot engine.

New email address just for my vw mail .. My mailbox was getting too full
sometimes and mixed with other stuff .. So please note the new address ..
