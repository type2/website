Subject: Re: [VB]  Big nut rear axle seal question

I'm not using the flat metal spacer from the kit. The spacer I am referring
to is the big thick spacer (that is what Bentley calls it) that contacts the
brake drum and the inner race of the roller bearing.

The spring is in the seal and drums are torqued. Which direction does the
spring face, toward the drum or toward the roller bearing?

The only things you use in that kit are the two paper gaskets, small o ring
and the seal that presses into the cover that goes over the bearings.
I have been told by a respectable trans builder to never use the metal
spacers in those kits, they are too thin and will not make a good seal on
the bearings.
make sure the spring is still on the pressed in seal and that all are
torqued properly. The drum is what compacts the small o ring. Are your
spring plates in good shape?
