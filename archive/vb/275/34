Subject: Starter bolt size

Does anyone know if the starter bolt on a stock 6 volt 65 bus is the same as
a starter bolt for a T4?  Mine seems to be the wrong bolt on my split and I
have a spare from a T4 I could use, if it can work.  If not, does anyone
happen to know the correct size bolt?

Thanks in advance,
