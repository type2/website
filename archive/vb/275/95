It has to produce as much more torque as the RGB ratio.  *  In a
'58 that's 1.4:1, so the stock 56 lb-ft (-at-) 2000 rpm has to become
78.4 lb-ft (-at-) 2000 rpm.  A "40 horse" makes 61 lb-ft (-at-) 2000 rpm,
an early 1500 makes 70.2 lb-ft (-at-) 2200 rpm, a late 1500 makes
75.2 lb-ft (-at-) 2000 rpm, and a 1600 makes 78.1 lb-ft (-at-) 2800 rpm.
(All numbers Bus and DIN, from Bentley or Without Guesswork.)

In other words, you'd have to swap the original engine for a
1600, and even then you'd still be a tiny bit (0.4%) short.

* Justification:

power = force * linear velocity (distance per time)
power = force * radius * 2 * pi * angular velocity (revs per time)
torque = force * radius
power = torque * 2 * pi * angular velocity (revs per time)

The power into the RGB must equal the power out of the RGB, ignoring
friction:

torque(in) * 2 * pi * angular velocity(in) =
  torque(out) * 2 * pi * angular velocity(out)

We know that angular velocity(in) = RGB ratio * angular velocity(out)

Substitute for angular velocity(in):

torque(in) * 2 * pi * RGB ratio * angular velocity(out) =
  torque(out) * 2 * pi * angular velocity(out)

Divide by 2 * pi * angular velocity(out):

torque(in) * RGB ratio = torque (out)
