Subject: Mystery coolers identified

Greasy Volks,

Friday after work we quickly solved the issue of the two mystery
coolers under the undercarriage of ou '78 (thought it wuz a '79, but its
a '78):

as some of you sharpies suggested, it was for an airconditioner--an
aftermarket one at that.  Strangely, someone used one of the hoses to
fish through two good sized wires into the undercarriage area.  Didn't
notice where they went to and don't care, we got the engine that is
supposed to be in good shape, . . . took of the fuel injection and we
are going to put duals on it and drop in in our '72 Westy resto
project.

Thanks for the suggestions, you guys know what of you speak!

Curt
