Subject: RE: [VB] Jerome Weather?

  It has had a little rain at Jerome for the last 5 years with 3 or was it 4
years ago when we had 15 hours straight. After it ened it was a beautiful
weekend. According to our local weather it is supposed to be in the high
80's low 90's during the day and in the high 60's low 70's at night with no
rain in sight. But up there you never know, so be prepared.

  ronnie  never ready to leave

Just saw on tv (and we all know how reliable THAT is),
that Flagstaff has just set a new record with 18
straight days of measureable precipitation.
Does this mean Jerome will be a mudbath/swamp this
year? 
Anyone in the area with an accurate update? 
Wanna know if we should pack the waders.
