I'm not sure what PPG prduct you used on your Bus--but it sure looks 3
ft. Deep--!!

Real nice job---no wonder folks want to know if you just refinished it.

 ya, definitely when I did my 65 westy 5? years ago, it was a ton of
work. Largely because I was figuring out wth I was doing. I had friends
who had painted before who helped out with sanding technique, and told
me what to buy in terms of paint and mixers and wipe off the hand oil
chemicals and all. used PPG paint.   It turned out much much better
than I expected, though there are plenty of little places where it could
have had more attention to detail, I was tired of messing with it, just
wanted a decent looking driver.   I learned a lot of appreciation for
bodywork and painting!!!! Also, you need all the friends you can get,
find a buddy who has done it before to give you tips if you can.
  I *still* get people asking if it was just painted!!!
pics on vintagebus.com   search for "PIR" It's the green/white bus
with the roof rack.
