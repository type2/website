Ron,
Who's urethane did you use?

Omni is good for semi dump trailers--that's what I use it for---or the
boxes of tandem dump trucks--just to match the PPG Concept urethane on
the cab--it's gonna get beat up anyway.

It's PPG's econo Delstar and if Delstar was used it would have gven you
longer paint life--but the Omni is 1/4 of the price. 

Here's a couple of suggestons for primer and paint--whch work out real
well for me.

For primer--Dupont has a product by the name of Uro Prime, which is a 3
part primer--
It can be used either as a high fill, or barrier coat ( depending on how
you mix it) and is urethane ( rubber)

Nothing will bleed through it--ever--and is really easy to sand.
Theonly problem with it---it takes 3 to 4 hours to totally cure prior to
sanding and applying a top coat.

For the paint I really like PPG's DBU  Urethane Basecoat, with their
Concept clearcoat.

Actually the base coat is still the same formula of Deltron which the
EPA forced them to phase out---but the newer clear is  EPA approved and
very easy to work with and sets up dust free in 8 minutes--

It's almost impssible to run this stuff because it's set up time is
fast.

I just refinished my 87 Westies nose on Friday night after work--from
door to door-- top to bottom, to get rid of the rocks marks--

Here's the key for front panal rock survival---

Add flex agent to the clear--like you would for rubber bumper's---no
more rock marks or chips--

I let it sit overnight---wet sanded the next morning with 2000--and
polished with 3-M Finesse, and was done at 1 PM.

Looks like glass---and went very quick---

Just some more painting idea's for long term results--
 
Happy Painting
