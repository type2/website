Sorry not heading to Yakima, but heading out Thurs. after werk w/ the 1st
wife in the 63 DC w/ new 1776 in it for Jerome.  Put bout 300 miles on it
since last Sat. a.m. when I put it in the bus.  Getting the oil
changed/valves adjusted/custom bus muffler by the builder (Art Thraen)
today, & heading south for fun & frolick. Not sure how I will fit in the
"new vendor" area instead of the usual old campin/partyin/swappin area, but
rumor has it that it will be quieter than the otra areas cuz all the vendors
are old farts like Ronnie & moi?

Waiting for pics/review of the java poured in the expresso bus.
