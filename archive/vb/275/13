Subject: '65 Wiper Motor

I replaced the armature in the wiper motor in my bus this weekend. Unfortunately it doesn't work now at all. It just gets hot and starts to smell! I really hope I fried it! I just love throwing cash away!
I have looked around for wiring diagrams but am unable to find one for my bus. The pre-66 diagrams show the wiper motor as having 2 wires and mine has three; and the switch as only having 2 wires and I have at least 4. It worked fine before the volt drop I had busted.
