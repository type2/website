All this talk of painting has brought out the mother hen in me.

If you are going to be using any TWO PART CATALYZED paint product,
PLEASE get or rent a SUPPLIED AIR breathing system.  A mask will not
protect you!  You might not get sick right away, but eventually you'll
be toting around one of those little O2 bottles with a canulla up your
nose.  That is if you live!

Do some research on isocynates and see what I'm talking about.
