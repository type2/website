Subject: RE: [VB] looking for heater tubes

I tried mine without the muffler boxes and it sounded like the motor had
been moved to my defrost.  The engine noise was really pronounced coming out
of the heater vents.

Is there an advantage to ditching the muffler boxes? Mine are both
there and in good shape?
