Ron,
Who's urethane did you use?

<On my DD I used PPG OMNI (cheap)100 dollars for a gallon with all
components . Even PPG gives it a 2 to 4 year life. I know of 2 other buses
besides mine that are chalking after 2 to 4 years that have used OMNI. You
really get what you pay for in paint, cheap is CHEAP and pricey is GOOD

Omni is good for semi dump trailers--that's what I use it for---or the
boxes of tandem dump trucks

On my DC, John used Global (PPG's preminum paint from Europe) Just the
paint, components and the clear cost more then I paid for the whole bus!!,
but PPG gives a lifetime warranty on Global.
