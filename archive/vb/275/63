Hi Wayne,

You will have to cut them to fit as they won't squish given the lengths and
material you have mentioned.....

.The trick is to cut the seals making sure you haven't stretched them. And,
in addition there should be a little bit of a pressure fit that you have to
calculate by sight and feel,. So it might take a couple of cuts to get that
right fit.
