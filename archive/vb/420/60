Ahhh... The things dreams are made of.  

So much of the bus community has progressed from "I'm driving this bus
because that's what I can afford and it give me the....  freedom! that I
need" to "I'm driving this bus because I can damn-well afford to and I like
to make believe I'm hungry and will do whatever it takes to get by".  I've
offered up to the list and subsequently thrown away a lot of items over the
past few years that I believed to be true treasures.  Things that I had
gathered and horded for many many years thinking either that I'd need them
or that some other worthy bus-lover would want.  But I guess what they say
about "one man's treasures".  Or is that supposed to be "one man's junk"?  I
can't recall anymore.

I fell in love with buses around 1983 when me and a friend bought a 65
weekender to bash around in.  I'm guessing that's what it was called since
it wasn't a pop-top, but had the z-bed and the suicide cabinet on the
passenger side that prevented any kind of visibility that direction.
Probably not a big deal since the only time you'd need to see out of that
window is if you had actually passed somebody and needed to move back over.
Not a common occurrence with that particular bus!  But driving around
Amarillo, TX in that beat-up, bondo-covered, rusty old bus imparted to me
such a feeling of uniqueness and being part of the whole at the same time
that I was hooked.

I don't know what your situation is, but if you're trying to pass on some
stuff like pitted door surrounds, a handle that looks like it came from a
side-beached bus, some "stirrup looking things", and some other misc stuff
then I have to assume you're just into buses (or at least were at some point
in your life) and I tip my cup to you :)  I sold my 73 Westy (owned from
1991 - 2005) and my 58 single cab (owned from 1997 - 2005) because I just
didn't have the time to keep them up and they deserved better that I was
giving them.  Well, the truth be told, I divorced my wife about that time
and found I no longer wanted to spend every evening and all day Saturday and
Sunday in the garage working on them anymore.  But either way I got out of
buses at that time and believe that both of my beloved buses found better
homes than I was providing at the time.  And me, in turn, found a much
happier life that unfortunately doesn't include time for buses and their
up-keep.

Anyway, thanks for offering up your time-forgotten treasures and I hope you
find some takers.  35-45 year old parts with their own unique histories are
a big part of the buses that happily roam the roads today and deserve better
than the dumpster.  Those lovely chrome thingies from the aftermarket
suppliers will never compare.

Cheers.
