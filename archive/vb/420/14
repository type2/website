Subject: tranny issues ... 

OK .. sorry if I said this before . looks like a finally have to get around
to my tranny stuff .. I have the original tranny for my bus .. small nut
from my 60 .. I WANT TO STICK WITH THE SMALL NUT REDUX BOXES . I like em, I
have a spare set, they are cheap to rebuild etc. but I want to get 5 to 10
mph out of my original tranny (it hasn't been in the bus for years and it
pops out of 4th) ..  so .. my question

 

What do people suggest I do (or have done) to my original 1960 tranny ..
what do I need to tell the rebuilder I want done to 4 gear / ring and pinion
etc.. (I don't know what a ring and pinion is) . I have a guy who can do the
stuff .. but I want to tell him what I want done . really . all I want to do
is go 5 to 10 mph faster . I'm OK with 3rd on big hills cause I'm there now
.
