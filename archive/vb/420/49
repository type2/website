Subject: Re: Hubcap

I heard through the grapevine the original hubcap might still be in NM. I have
a search going on right now trying to track it down. The search is a bit stuck
locating one person who should have some knowledge.
I vote we hold on for a little while, there is so much good 'stuff' that has
been included with the traveling hubcap it would be a shame to not try to get
it back.
