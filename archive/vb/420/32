Hi Chris,
	Interesting article.  It seems like minimally we can get the CR  
exactly even in all cylinders and then try jetting lean.  Get the HP  
per cylinder as close to even as possible.  We fly our buses at a  
lower altitude than most aircraft and we don't have the ability to  
adjust air/fuel ratio or manifold pressure while driving.  I have  
noticed some engines run hot jetted rich, lots of timing advance and  
low CR.
