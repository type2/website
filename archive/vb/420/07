Subject: RE: [VB] Engine wows ... damn it.

My thought are along the same lines as Eric and Barb, dual relief case,
counterweighted crank, doghouse cooler tins and fan.  What I might do
diffrently would be use a 74mm crank (no clearancing), and 83mm pistons with
the singleport heads, which would give you a 1602, a little bigger
displacement instead of 1584 (1600).  The outer diameter of the cylinders is
the same so no problems with the heads or case, but you get an extra 1.5 mm
cylinder wall thickness from the 85.5's, and a longer stroke would give you
better torque.

Set compression to 7.5:1 and you should be good to go.  Also, I would do a
little MILD polishing on the heads and have the entire rotating assembly
dynamically balanced.  Next best would be balance the rods and pistons
yourself, after researching exactly how to do it properly.  Once running
exhaust gas analysis will help you get the carb and jetting dialed in.
