Close...but late splits were top color inside.  (65 was the change, maybe? 
Clara?)

Will's 66 would likely be Beige Grey over Titan Red, though there was some 
variation.  Interior would be all Beige Grey.  Door jams and door 
interiors would be the exception iirc with lower color coming into the 
jams up to the door seal area.  The door below the beltline is two tone on 
the inside, mostly focusing on the "exposed" areas around the door panels, 
though.  Not sure on cargo and hatch.
