Hi E&B,

I've been thinking of CB lately for their electric fuel pump which
I've been recommended as being properly regulated and putting out
sufficient volume.

I had ordered some Porsche gen pulleys, but all that got left at Bus
Boys when I moved.

Not using a stroker counterweighted crank is the one thing I regret
when I built the 1776 for my 62 DD walk thru.

I've been thinking about you guys lately. I've just finished reading
Battle for the Beetle. There's some things in there that reminded me
of things you guys have been saying. I'll write back later when I find
the quotes.

Take care,

John

 Hi John,
 Definitely a good idea!!? We have been using Claude's Buggies oil
filter/pumps with good results.? You do need to cut, angle down and
slightly forward at the neck of the pump cover so as to have the
filter clear the left heat riser on the stock muffler.
 ?? Also using the type 4 oil cooler and 356 Porsche gen pulley and VW
"D" lower pulley help to keep it cooler.
 Right now looking at using a 78.8 CW crank for our next engine for more torque.
