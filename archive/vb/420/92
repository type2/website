Hey,

My April 61 microbus is lower color (SWR) on the dash, but a 62 is upper color
on the dash.
 I think the change was for the 62 model year.

Just got back from Bulli Brigade yesterday... it's good to be home.
Whew!
what a trip!

Clara

Close...but late splits were top color inside. (65 was the change, maybe?
Clara?)

Will's 66 would likely be Beige Grey over Titan Red, though there was some
variation. Interior would be all Beige Grey. Door jams and door interiors
would be the exception iirc with lower color coming into the jams up to the
door seal area. The door below the beltline is two tone on the inside, mostly
focusing on the "exposed" areas around the door panels, though. Not sure on
cargo and hatch.
