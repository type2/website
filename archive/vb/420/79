Subject: re:6 volt o-ring style flywheel ...

I had to deal with something like this when swapping from 6V to 12V. I used
a grinder to clearance most of the bellhousing. Then I installed the engine,
without tightening the bolts. I slowly turned the engine by hand, and
tightened engine bolts.

I remember this working, not sure exactly if I had to start the engine to
clearance the last little bit, or if I did it all be hand at the end.
