Subject: Re: [VB] tranny issues ...

I will side with Eric and Barb on the trans. I have a 3.875 r&p in my bus 
with big nut rgb's. I also have a 1776cc engine. I don't recommend changing 
from a stock trans and big nut rgb's with a stock engine. Not enough torque 
to pull.

BTW going from the stock 4.125 to the 3.875 r&p is about a 6% increase in 
gear ratio which will slow the engine by 6%.

regards.
