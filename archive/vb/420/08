Subject: Re: [VB] Engine wows ... damn it. 

The suggestion people made are good.?? I am a fan of 1600 sp engines myself.? balanced sounds nice.? Use a later alloy dual relief case.



I looked into rebuilding a big bore 40hp recently and the price of ps and cs is more than for a 1600... but if that is what you want they are available.



Another option is a brand new Mexi-motor from VW in the crate. These are 1600 DP



To use a 1600 whether sp or dp, you cannot use your 40hp

intake manifold

cylinder head tin

rear tin (rear is rear)

?but you can use the rest of the tin and the gen stand, generator,?etc



You may want to go with a doghouse cooler.



Here is a pic of the tin for my Dad's 63 truck.?

?The big bore 40hp still ran but after ten years of him driving it the power was wimpy and the oil light came on at idle.??? He got a 1600dp mexi-motor and the tin powdercoated.?? 

There are lots of pieces of tin... We dressed it with a doghouse, all the little tins, the pre-heat stuff, thermostat, and correct for 63 1 ton?air cleaner on the left.

So . my big bore 40 hp is on its last legs. I had it rebuilt with used parts
last year to get the summer out of it and that worked OK .. but now it
appears finished .  and putting more money into it doesn't seem to make
sense ..
