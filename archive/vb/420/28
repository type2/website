Subject: Re: [VB] Swing axel tranny question.

Yes, you can replace the swing axle boot. There are split boots available. I 
have replaced mine many times without removing the trans. A bit messy as you 
will have some trans oil drip out, not a lot. You will want to top off the 
trans after the swap.

All the other gaskets require removal and disassembly.

I have a 66 bus and it appears there is a fluid leak near where the axel
joins the transmission body.

Is there a seal/gasket that may be leaking??  If so, can it be replaced
with out pulling the tranny??
