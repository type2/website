 Hi John,
Unless you are building a museum piece, you are better off with the later RGBs.? They last longer between rebuilds due to that better lower outer roller bearing, so cost is offset with not having to rebuild so often.? 

Plus standard later RGBs come with higher gearing, AND 20 % bigger brakes that are less $$$ to rebuild.

As for you wanting to go 5 to 10 miles faster, that is like saying you want to be 5 to 10 inches taller without posting if you are 4 or 6 foot tall.....

You need to figure out what RPM range you are going to be happy with for each gear and what cruising MPH you are shooting for!!!

Then good to talk to your transaxle rebuilder and hash out what he thinks.

? We went with 1,500 - 3,000 RPM, and a 60 MPH cruising speed.? Then went with the 3.875 R&P Freeway Flier transaxle with stock .82 fourth gear.? If you or anyone else wants to pmail us we can send you our "Modified Transaxle History" on how and why we went that way.

R&P can be seen in the Idiot's manual drawings, and you can get more info at the below website:
