Subject: Re: [VB] Reverse lights on Bumper

Back in the early '80's, before it was a crime to drill a hole in splash 
guards, I made some "C" shaped brackets out of sheet metal and mounted 
my backup lights to the splash guards. The holes I drilled in my guards 
are under the edge of the bumper, so if I ever take the lights off, the 
holes won't be very easy to see. After all these years I think that's 
unlikely, but that's what I was thinking way back then.

Did your bus come with bumper mounted backup lights originally? If so, 
why not just mount them on the bumper?
