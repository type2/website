Subject: 6 volt o-ring style flywheel ... 

So .. it looks like rimco will make me a 6 volt 0-ring style flywheel. Price
is actually not so bad .. they can make 180 mm or 200 mm . I have a new
clutch on my 40 hp engine .. so I'm thinking I can just use that .. that
must be 180 mm no? OTOH .. I don't mind buying a new clutch if there is a
real advantage to 200 mm over 180 mm.

 

So .. is there much of an advantage of a 200 mm flywheel over a 180 mm
flywheel?
