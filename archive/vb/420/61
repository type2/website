"Probably not a big deal since the only time you'd need to see out of that

LOL all well and truly spoken. The money they get for used buses absolutely amazes me now, queue cognitive dissonance and let fly. I'm not lamenting though, it is what it is, and that's okay. If you're looking for some cheap ingredients you can put in a pot and stir with sweat equity and end up with something that makes you smile, something will always be out there. You can get very good deals on ratty sailboats these days, people are absolutely desperate to get rid of sailboats. =^}

Whatever happened to my dear old patented bus bumper remover.....er.....my unique detachable trailer hitch? I think I gave that thing to some Canadians and then they tried to get rid of it by raffling it off as if it were desirable. That thing had a provenance and I hope it is out there being loved or at least examined for its bewilderment value. And not used though, it was a disaster waiting to happen. =^}

Anyway my junky crap is spoken for except for the rubber which I am told is a rear window seal 64-79 and it will straighten out of left in the sun for a while. I had an inquiry specifically about the little ceramic hand, but my correspondent decided the hand was too small, as he is building some sort of tableau to annoy his neighbors, and he is going to seek another ceramic hand that better meets his needs. I am not making this up. Cheers all, see you at the harbor. --Ken
