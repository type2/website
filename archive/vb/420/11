The only thing I haven't seen recommended that I think is really 
important is an oil filter. Add an oil filter to whatever engine you go 
with. Your engine will last a lot longer and you will have a lot more 
parts you can reuse when rebuild time finally comes if you have a filter.?


 


 


 

Hi John,
Definitely a good idea!!? We have been using Claude's Buggies oil filter/pumps with good results.? You do need to cut, angle down and slightly forward at the neck of the pump cover so as to have the filter clear the left heat riser on the stock muffler.
?? Also using the type 4 oil cooler and 356 Porsche gen pulley and VW "D" lower pulley help to keep it cooler.
Right now looking at using a 78.8 CW crank for our next engine for more torque.
