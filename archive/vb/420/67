Subject: Reverse lights on Bumper

Hi everyone. I want to add a pair of reverse lights. I have an early 67
without the cutouts in the sheet metal so i need to mount em on the bumper
under tne overider tubes. anyone have a good way/idea on mounting them without
drilling holes in the bumper itself? I tried welding tabs behind the top side
and drilling the tabs but the light butt up against the body so its too close.
thought i would ask and see.
 
TIA, Ken
