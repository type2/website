I believe your best bet is to get a trans with a 3.88 ring and pinion.

And yes the trans rebuilders should be able to give you good advice. He will 
need to know what size engine you intend to install.

I used to run a 1600 dual port with a weber progressive and regularly drive 
65-70 on the highway on a standard big nut drivetrain.

Is the 3.44 option still available? Ronny at Bustoration used to swear by 
that with a stroker engine, not sure what size.
