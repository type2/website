Subject: DP intake gaskets

Hi,

I picked up new intake manifold gaskets yesterday. The shop had graphite paper
and aluminum gaskets. Cheap enough so I purchased a set of each.

What do you guys recommend using.

My thoughts are this: The DP intake manifolds are a nice large chunk of
aluminum that can draw heat from the heads thereby reducing the temp somewhat.
Using the graphite paper gaskets presents a bit more thermal insulation than
the aluminum gaskets. The guy at the counter told me that the aluminum gaskets
are what's in original equipment.
