Subject: RE: [VB] 200 mm vs. 180 mm

Yeah .. I broke down and ordered a 200 mm 6 volt flywheel from rimco .. they
make em .. I guess they machine off the 12 volt gearing and put on 6 volt
gearing .. I have a really low milage 180 clutch .. but I think 200 mm
flywheel is the way to go since parts are more readily available ... I
figured they must be the same outside diameter given they both have 190
teeth .. but I thought I'd ask ..

It appears that a 200 mm 6 volt flywheel sure has its supporters .. a bit
surprising since they are as rare as hens teeth ..

Thanks
