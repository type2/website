Subject: Engine wows ... damn it. 

So . my big bore 40 hp is on its last legs. I had it rebuilt with used parts
last year to get the summer out of it and that worked OK .. but now it
appears finished .  and putting more money into it doesn't seem to make
sense .. 

 

So . any recommendations as to what I could do. I would like a bit more
power than the 40 hp and I have a good set of 1600 sp heads rebuilt and read
to go .. is there anything I can use from the 40hp engine . will any of the
tin work? I guess the generator and 6 volt starter should be fine .. 

 

Hmmm . I'm kinda choked .
