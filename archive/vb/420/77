Hi John,
	I'd go with the 200mm flywheel.  You'll have a greater choice of  
clutch parts and in time the 180 mm parts will be limited.  They are  
now.  You'll need to open up the bell housing a bit (it may have  
already been done?), there are good posts out there on how to do  
this.  I like the ones where folks somehow begin to mount the engine,  
start it up and push it home with the running engine grinding the  
bell housing to the proper size.  Think about the 6 to 12 volt  
starter issue.  Rimco does good work and the 180mm flywheel will not  
save you all that much time.....  Gary Gibson
