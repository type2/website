Yeah, that is my velvet green crewcab on the other side of Andrew's 
'67 in the picture.  I have not been to EB in a loooooong time.  I 
should go next year and catch up with all you guys in the Carolinas.

Ted Finesman (Cincinnati) and Andrew Whitlock (Atlanta), fwiw....

EB2K was the year I hitchhiked up to EB I think (probably with Easterwood) 
and from there up to WV with...oh..John someone...Baker maybe..to pickup 
a waterpumper from John Anderson. The 66 was down with the transmission 
flu.
