Yes, you can use a 6V FW on a 1600.?? 

I prefer to use?the larger clutch, o-ring??6V FW if I am running a 1600.?? This was the 1500 66 FW or something like that.?? They are harder to find.??

Much more common are the small clutch stepped 6V FW.??? 

? If you look where the FW meets the crankshaft of the motor, either there is a groove for an O ring, or a step.



If your crank is stepped, you should use a stepped FW.

You can use an o-ring FW on a stepped or on a?non stepped crank.

Your 1600 probably does not have a stepped crank, but I cannot tell from here.



The FW has?three separate characteristics:

Teeth (6v or 12V)

clutch size

o-ring or stepped,

which can appear in any combination, though 12V-large-oring and 6V-small-stepped are the most commonly found.???



Whatever FW you use, make sure the surface the main seal rides on is smooth and provodes a good sealing surface.
