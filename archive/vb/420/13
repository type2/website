Subject: RE: [VB] Engine woes ... damn it.

So ... is there such a thing as over-sized studs to bolt heads to block ..
they are the long ones .. like 8" or so ... looks like the old guy might be
able to salvage my engine but I need over-sized studs ...

I'm still in the market for a 1600/1641 ASAP ... I'm just saving all the
great responses for now and considering what I need.
