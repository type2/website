Subject: Re: [VB] 200 mm vs. 180 mm

well... the 200mm is usually a 12 volt ring gear,, and is bigger than the 6v
ring gear that usually has a 180mm clutch
you can get a 6v ring gear with a 200mm clutch,, and a 6v ring gear with a
180mm clutch.. both those flywheels have the same OD

hope that helps
Jamie
