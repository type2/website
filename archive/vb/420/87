mounted on 67 beetle reverse light bar, 'massaged' (bashed) into shape.
bolted on with exosting bolt:

Hi everyone. I want to add a pair of reverse lights. I have an early 67
ithout the cutouts in the sheet metal so i need to mount em on the bumper
nder tne overider tubes. anyone have a good way/idea on mounting them without
rilling holes in the bumper itself? I tried welding tabs behind the top side
nd drilling the tabs but the light butt up against the body so its too close.
hought i would ask and see.

IA, Ken
