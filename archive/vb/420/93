The inside was not two tone, just the outside.
for a 66, they painted the entire bus the lower color, then sprayed the upper
color on.
Then you can see the lower color on wear through on the headlight bucket.

When I re-did the 65 I had, I didn't actually do that, but just painted the
cab inside and lower half the blue-white, then taped off and painted the lower
outside velvetgreen (had the back inside area taped off and didn't re-paint
that at all)
Here is a pic of my original paint Titian red/white deluxe:

you can see how the cab door was taped when they sprayed the red

so actually the inside of the front door is two tone.

normally the interior paint color is the same as the bottom paint  the
ead liner covers most of the upper interior so there is no need to split the
olor inside.

Where  does one "cut" the different paint colors on the  inside??
