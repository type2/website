 Hi John,
First figure out what RPM range and what MPH cruising speed you are shooting for.? 

Right now by just saying you want 5 to 10 MPH faster is like saying you want to be 5 to 10 inches taller, but do not list you if you are 4 or 6 foot tall.....

? Then talk to your transaxle rebuilder about the can and can not do's.? 
? After all you more than likely do not want to end up with a tranny that forces you to do 5,000 RPM in the top of third just to get into the bottom of fourth gear at 1,500 RPM!!!? BTDT.

As for your small nut RGBs.? If you plan on driving your bus and not making it a museum piece, get the later RGB with higher gearing and front suspension.? 20% bigger brakes which feel more like 50% bigger.? While the later RGBs are more $$$ to rebuild that outer lower roller bearing last longer so cost is offset with not having to rebuild the RGBs near as much as with the earlier RGBs.? Plus the later brake parts are less $$$.

If you Pmail us a request, we will send you (or anybody else) our "Modified transaxle history of how and why and how we went with the 3.875 R&P FF.? Plus good to search the archives about transaxle gearing.


 


The ring and pinion are the last two gears in the rear of the transaxle before the RGBs.? See the below website for more info on R&P and look through your "Idiot's Manual":
