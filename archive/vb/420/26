Subject: [VB] tranny issues ... Ronnie's engine

I have one of Ronnie's engines and a "freeway flyer" he had Rancho put together for me. The engine is close to 1900cc, dual Solex 32/35s I believe, and has a cam that favors the lower end of the RPM band. Nice torque, good power. I recommend the combination.
