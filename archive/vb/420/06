 Hi John,
Just get a good core 1600 with DR case.? Go with DH shroud cooling system.? About the only parts from your 40 HP engine you can use is the generator (not the cooling fan),  fuel pump, and FW.
? Also invest in a counterweight crankshaft.? Cast cranks are less costly but can crack especially if you like higher RPMs.? Stock cranks with welded on counter weights are much better.? Probably check out DPR for those.? Then have crank and FW balanced together, and get rods and pistons balanced or do them yourself.


?? We have been running slip in 1641 cc slip in P&Cs and after 60,000 miles they are still are working like new.? If you keep the engine cool they do not warp.? Invest in oil temp and pressure gauges to help with that and other troubles down the road.
? Freeway flier geared transaxle will help keep the engine cooler with lower RPMs and allow for higher MPH.? We are getting 58 MPH (-at-) 3,000 RPM in fourth with stock sized tires and 60 MPH with slightly larger rear tires.
