Hi Don,
It depends on so many factors!  First hopefully you have other autos to drive 
right now.  Second it depends on how much you want to rebuild properly or 
band aid it together and risk having it come apart later out in the middle of 
nowhere.  Third how badly are the parts of the engine worn.  It could turn 
out that all the internal engine parts are just flying in loose formation and 
can not be rebuilt!  Best advise we could give is to go ahead and do it up 
right the first time.  Also buy the Bentley reprint of the 1963-67 bus shop 
manual and a Bentley Official Service Manual for later bus or bug if you are 
using a post-1967 engine.   Eric&Barb
