This  morning I took the top bows for my 1949 Hebm=FCller in to Winslow's Tr=
im=20
Shop in Garland, Texas (a suburb of Dallas) and was surprised that they were=
=20
expecting me to come in and tell them all about Claus Missing. I did. Claus,=
=20
you may have another customer as a result. Do you make bows for VW's other=20
that the Hebm=FCller?

I took a look at the bows. There were four bows, as I recall, plus a back=20
window piece. The fellows at Winslow's were surprised at the quality of the=20
bows, and they only had good words for Claus. They asked me for information=20
on Claus, which I started to give them, but we decided that I would write it=
=20
down for posterity. I'm gonna do that sometime tonight.

Then I went over to Knight's Foreign Auto Parts and told them about the bows=
.=20
They were surprised, too. Then I went to the shop and took them a part that=20=
I=20
had just received (forgot what it was though).=20

Then, I went home and picked up a Porsche steering wheel that I had bought=20
for the 1971 bus. I took the latter back to the shop, and Scott kept telling=
=20
me that the Porsche steering wheel wouldn't fit and would make the 1971 bus=20
hard to steer. I poo-pooed Scott and told him that we'd see. He offered to=20
buy the steering wheel off of me, but I kept saying no!

Tried to get the steering wheel off of the 1971 bus, but it wouldn't come=20
loose. Left it
with some penetrating oil on the nut overnight, hoping that it would come=20
loose by morning. Is there some trick to getting a bus steering wheel loose?=
=20
The nut is loose, but the wheel won't come loose. There's no mention of the=20
steering wheel in the Bently manual that I just bought.

Scott and Todd were fooling with the front beam of the Zwitter when I got=20
back. I went
out and bought some black glossy paint and some mixing buckets. I came home=20
and
found a letter that was gonna do some business, came back and Scott and Todd=
=20
found that we needed four new tie rod ends, four new shocks, and some of=20
those rubber thingys that go on the tie rod ends or some place up front on=20
the Zwitter. They were chipping away at 50 years of dirt and grime when I=20
left. There's about another day's worth of work to be done in removing the=20
dirt and grime and painting the front beam and gas tank black.

Oh, yeah! I ordered three 6-volt battery tenders yesterday (for the Heb, the=
=20
Zwitter, and for the 1955). And the old boy who owns the new car (1956 on a=20
1954 pan) contacted me at 4:00 am to make arrangements to ship the car to=20
Dallas next week.
