  In a sense we are trying to "bribe" people into coming, and it is working.
Our goal is to get everybody together again for friendship and frolic with
the intent of raising a pile of money for the kids. Are we pushing to much?
I hope not.

Ronnie

ps. Does this mean we have you bribed into coming?

Is it just me, or does it seem like they're trying to
*bribe* people into going with all the raffle prizes?
