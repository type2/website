Subject: Mounting a Spare on the front...


Fellow Listee Joel Bidinger came by today and delivered
a spare tire mount for me today, and I wasted no time in
getting that puppy welded on (bolting just wasn't good
enough).  Some people think a spare tire on the front is
hideous, but I *like* it.

You can see pix of Joel, as well as other listees, at

http://www.vintagebus.com/gallery/listee.html

I've also added a cool new feature where you can throw your
own 2 cents worth at any given gallery entry!
