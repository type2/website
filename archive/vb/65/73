Subject: Spring for 59 engine lid support

Greetings All,

I am pleased to report that my 59 deluxe is just about all
done - driver engine is built and in (1600 single port with
type4 cooler in widened doghouse shroud, wide fan  and 38 amp
generator, fully balanced - honkin'!).

Drove it around the block for the first time in 5 years yesterday
(safaris and sunroof open of course) and it was SO smooth and quiet...just
beautiful...

Anyway I have one thing driving me nuts.  I can't get
the little spring on the engine lid support in and I can't figure
out how it goes for the life of me...I have no buses with one actually
fitted to look at and I can't any fine detail in any literature.....

So can someon explain how this thing fits?  The spring has
a U at one end, a closed loop at the other and 'circle' in the
middle.  Obvious mounting points are the little tab
on the end of the engine lid support arm and the tab
on the bracket on the bus.....

Thanks

RobK
