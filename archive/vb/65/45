Hi Rex,
Doubt it unless you build a chamber to flood with pure Argon so you can weld 
inside, but check with your local welding shop to make sure.  Our Hobart wire 
feed welder is MIG and TIG adaptable, but will only weld pure aluminum.  Not 
the tranny/engine case electron alloy that is a aluminum, and magnesium mix.
