The convertible top bows for my 1949 Hebm=FCller are in Texas somewhere wait=
ing=20
to be delivered. Claus Missing did a heckuva good job in expediting the=20
order. I hafta wait. There's no customs duties to be paid, either.

This morning, I took a bus book into the shop dealing with the 1971 bus. We=20
were having trouble figuring out how to take the door handles off. Each door=
=20
has a different
key, and one door won't lock (because we don't have a key to it). I had been=
=20
trying to=20
contact Steve Sandlin about the locks. But he is nowhere to be found these=20
days. I couldn't locate him at his website, and the phone number I had is no=
=20
longer in service. The book cost was $38.97, and I got it from The Volkswage=
n=20
Store.

Speaking of the $500 bus, for $150 we are buying front seats and a complete=20
air conditioning system for buses tomorrow. It's from a junk yard. Cost will=
=20
be $150.

This AM I brought in a set of Mustang water and heater hoses to replace the=20
dual port
hoses, etc. on my 1974 Super Beetle. They were blue - the same color I had=20
the engine tin powder coated. The two dual ports were the problem. I couldn'=
t=20
use silver or black  pipes, because the tin was powder coated blue. I alread=
y=20
had blue plug wires, blue dizzy, blue dizzy cap, blue hoses, blue air=20
conditioning hoses, blue compressor, and a blue front on the compressor.=20
Anyway, they fit OK, and now I have a full set of blue furnishings to go wit=
h=20
my engine. Cost was about $70.

I went down to Harbor Freight Tools and bought what I thought was a 6-volt=20
battery tender. Then to my displeasure, I found that the thing worked on=20
automatic only with 12-volt batteries. So, I took it back, and ordered three=
=20
battery tenders form Halon Marketing, Inc. (one for the Heb, one for the=20
Zwitter, and one for the 1955 beetle). Cost was $39.95 plus shipping, each,=20
or about $120 total.                                                       =20=
 =20
                                                                           =20=
 =20
                                                                           =20=
 =20
                               =20
=20
Scott got busy and just about finished replacing the transaxle on the=20
Zwitter. He also
replaced the left front fluted headlight on the Heb. Todd screwed around wit=
h=20
the gas
tank on the Zwitter.

Leeroy didn''t really get started on the Heb engine, which troubles me=20
because he has been promising me for the past two weeks. I took him my=20
starting kit and starter.
I'll just not bug him tomorrow. Maybe he'll get high behind.
