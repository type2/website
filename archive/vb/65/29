Subject: Buses by the Bridge VI info

    I have been bombarded for info on BBB VI, go to
www.oldvolks.com/events/bbb/2002 and you will find a flyer and info. If you
are looking for a hotel The Island Inn is across the street from the event
and we have a special BBB VI rate. Go to www.golakehavasu.com for more hotel
info. The response is overwhelming and we are looking forward to seeing all
of our friends old and new. The raffle is huge as is all the fun?.

thanks for the band width   Ronnie  London Bridge Bullis    BBB VI
