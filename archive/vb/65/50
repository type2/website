Hi Rich,
Best to inspect and remove grease if you have too much in there.  If it is 
too full it can cause the grease to be stirred between the spindle and the 
brake drum hub.  This heats up the grease up to the point that the grease 
looses it's lubricating qualities and thusly the possiblity of bearing 
failure.  Which can cause the bearing/s to weld themselfs to the spindle and 
drums at the same time, causing the spindle to shear off!

>>Still need to pick up some tie rods.  Speaking of tie rods, I know I adjust 
them to get the same size to get the toe-in right.  I was also thinking of 
taking it somewhere for a front-end allignment afterwards.  Can the local 
tire store do that,  or is this a specialty thing (given the fact I am 
talking a 35 year old vehicle (its a '67) <<

With the Bentley reprint of the 1963-67 VW Bus Shop Manual and an Idiot's 
manual you should inspect the link pin shims for proper offset and there 
after set your toe in to about .120" with great success.    Eric&Barb
