hey ronnie, do you have the 70s barbie yet?  i remember you really wanting her and telling me that you'd be mad if i got her before you.  well, i'm not gonna have her for bbb but will for the next bus adventure... oh yeah, you can be sure i'm gonna get a bunch of raffle tickets for the 60s barbie!  who needs a tranny or a turnkey engine when you have barbie?  haha!

cheers,
