Subject: Re: [VB] Any Lawers??????

when i had a serious accident caused by a guy running a red light, i got
recent copies of the NEATO newsletter, showing busses for sale in the same
condition, as well as Hot VW's magazine's classifieds. hey, i figured they
had outrageous prices, and any bit of ammunition in my favor would be a
great help.
a few xerox copies later, to the insurance company of the other driver, and
they settled without any further run around, BS, or trying to offer me $500
for my bus. i got the price I wanted to settle for, not their price.
this was back in the pre "computer" price driven days. i guess computer
(anonymous) generated estimates would work, but printed materials (like
hemmings), personal photos, and physical estimates would probably be better.
good luck.
