From alot of experience..............

What you need to do is buy one complete "late" tie rod assembly (2 ends, 1 rod) take on end off and put an early one in it's place. Do the opposite to the adjustable one on your Bus, early one off the outer, later one on. This will give you 2 adjustable
tie rod assemblies both with early inners and late outers.
