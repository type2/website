Subject: RE: [VB] Mounting a Spare on the front... Scare!

Well, Thom, if you're putting a spare tire on the front of your panel, I
think I'll airbag, cut the wheel wells, put on some wide 15" wire wheels
with real skinny tires, and chop the cab top off so it's a convertible to
the Tipper ;-)

Thom mused:
Well, my primary objective was to scare people into thinking
I was putting one of those spare tire mounts on a bus!  In
real life, that's the faux Westfalia trailer I'm building.  It
even has real VW spindles and wheels.
