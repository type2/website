Subject: engine rack

Hello

Any of you have ever mad an engine rack!
Im planning to build one instead of buying one, im looking for ideas, but if
its cheaper to buy one then ..

As im often alone, i thought if i had an hydraulic piston to lift it will be
better

thx for any idea / picture / website about it
