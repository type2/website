I think wolfsburg west has some 'German' lenses but they're 60 a piece!
ouch.  I just got two complete lights (holders, seals, and lenses) off of
epuke for 119.  The passenger side rear light on the 67 tipper is cracked
and the bulb holder inner chrome is almost gone.  The drivers side lens is
quite faded.

Another possibility is to email BBT in Belgium.
