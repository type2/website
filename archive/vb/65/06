Subject: Palo Alto,CA listees...favor?

Hey guys,

Was wondering if any listees in the Palo Alto area could look at a bus for a 
former listee.  He's really interested in the bus but wants to make sure it's 
a good one before driving out from Vegas.

p-mail Eric if you can help:   eaallred(-at-)lvcm.com

See y'all in Havasu..I'll be leaving Temecula friday a.m. so if anyone is 
interested in busavanning..let me know.

Beto
