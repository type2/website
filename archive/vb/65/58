I like the "how to build your vw aircooled engine" or whatever it's called 
from Wilson. It walks you through everything and worked very good for me.

Get lots of ziplocks and walmart bags and some big boxes and a sharpie. Put 
everything in bags and label them. Don't be afraid to use too many bags.

Take your time and expect to wait a while for parts to come in the mail. 
Especially stuff you loose or unexpectingly have to get or stuff you forgot 
to order the first time.

Make friends with a local VW shop or guru so you've got someone local to go 
to for small stuff. I used mine for removing the flywheel, and then again 
for installing it and setting the endplay (while I watched and learned). 
That gland nut is a major B*TCH! Makes it easier if you have a big bertha 
impact wrench. I don't.

Just do it and have fun. I get compliments from the local shops on how well 
my engine runs "that's a great sounding little engine!". It was my first 
and I ran into a few problems along the way. But I did it cheap and it runs 
like a "Singer".

Good luck.
