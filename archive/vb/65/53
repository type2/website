Subject: Re: [VB] aluminum welding...arc welder?

yes you could weld aluminum with the arc welder we have the rods at work and 
i try to practice on scrap when ever i can.
but be warned its not like welding steel
its really hard to get it just right    practice, practice
you have to go pretty fast but slow enough to get in to the piece
if you are trying to do something thin(FORGET IT)
BETTER WITH A MIG FOR THAT
