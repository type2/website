Yes the rubber seals are different too.  I put euro taillights in my 15 
window, with real used german bulb holders, one real seal, and crappy repop 
lenses.   The lenses fit better with the real euro seal than the US seal.

someone mentioned making euro style bulb holder from two us style bulb 
holders.  why not?

 I think wolfsburg west has some 'German' lenses but they're 60 a piece!
 ouch.  I just got two complete lights (holders, seals, and lenses) off of
 epuke for 119.  The passenger side rear light on the 67 tipper is cracked
 and the bulb holder inner chrome is almost gone.  The drivers side lens is
 quite faded.
 
 Another possibility is to email BBT in Belgium.
