1 thing I did find out is that you use the Bay window adjustable tie rod for
the right side and put an early tie rod end on them. When this is done it
gives you the same length as the non adjustable split bus one and makes
adjustments much easier

Ok, I know this isn't popular with purist.  But the 66 is getting lowered
Spindles.  For you folks that are using lowered spindles; Were are you buy
Tie Rods and Ends separetly?  I know I have to use outer Ends from 68 and up
to get the bigger shaft.
