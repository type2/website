A coil alone will not produce a spark, it needs to have the magnetic field
broken to produce the higher voltage, that's the job done by the points
opening and closing.  A Model - T coil had the points on top of the coil and
produced a "buzz" when powered thus producing an almost constant spark.

Those Model - T coils were great for electric hand shockers we used to use
in the haunted houses, 6 volts could produce 50,000 volts when put through
the coil.  Of course there was almost zero amps which is what causes injury.

I'm sure this would work on a bus tail pipe if the idle jet was turned up a
bit and with the exhaust pressure the bus engine produces, I'm sure the
flame would look impressive at night.
