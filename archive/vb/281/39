Subject: [VB] Planning ahead for 2004

I just noticed that the Browntrout VW Microbus calendar for 2004 is 
already available: 
http://www.calendars.com/product.asp?TID={68F26B68-0B91-4BDC-AF18-9B482418A49E}&PID=1&MGID=2805&IID=7183

Must be some misprints in the list of "Featured Microbuses", though.  A 
1950 Crew Cab?

Where has the year gone?
