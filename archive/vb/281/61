Hi Michael,
They should work just fine!  We have a 1966 Edition Tech Bulletin which shows 
these in KGs, and bugs.  The bug images show a 1300-1500 engine with two of 
these larger oil bath cleaners.  The two cleaners have inlet snouts on opposite 
sides of the tube going to the carb through 1964-67 bus air cleaner rubber 
tubing and a modified 1964-67 bus metal tubing to the carb welded in the shape 
of a "T".
  The way any oil bath air cleaners work is the oil level is higher than the 
bottom of the horse hair like stuff filter area of the air cleaner and thusly 
the air is sucked, broken up into tiny bubbles by the horse hair like stuff so 
the dirt/dust in it, touches oil and stays in the air cleaner.  Paper/foam 
air cleaners can not beat a stock air cleaner for supplying clean air to your 
engine!  The only advantage of non-oil bath air cleaners is in extreme driving 
conditions over very rough terrain where the oil would be thrown out.  In those 
conditions the stock VW would soon start to show body stress cracking.
