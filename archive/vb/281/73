Subject: "Black Box" on 1966

hey all,
I recently picked up a 66 standard bus that I've been working on, but it is 
missing the "black box" that runs all of the brake lights and everything. 
Being, as I am, new to the world of VW's, I am having a very hard time 
locating a new one. I was also wondering if it is in any way possible to 
wire my bus without one (or use the same set up that older busses did) If 
This is not possible, I could really use some help in locating one.
Thanks a bunch,
Kelly
