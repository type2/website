Subject: Newer Nine Pin Relay in a '67 question

I have a newer NOS box dated 11/75 with the nine connections, identical to the
older models. The only difference is a brown ground wire coming out of the box
splitting into both a screw connector and a female connector. Want to use this
on my '67...... Anybody use this newer box in an earlier bus and what did you
do with the ground wire and/or what is it for??
