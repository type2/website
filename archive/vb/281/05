Subject: Re:Welders

I just wanted to chime in a bit. I have 1 Lincoln Weldpak 100 on gas. I have
2 Miller 130XP's on gas. All 110v, these are the 3 welders i use the most on
sheet metal . The Lincoln is better on the thinner stuff , less splatter and
welds better at the low heat, the Millers do better on the thicker stuff
(ie: 12 ga and heavier). Anything over 3/16 I grab my Millermatic 250 220
Volt or old faithful Craftsman  stick. The only one i have to wait on at
times is the stick (aluminum coils), and usually i'm making a gorilla bead
when that happens ,, later and good luck.
