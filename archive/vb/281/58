Are you talking about the ones at
http://www.vintagebus.com/techinfo/eber/eb-011.jpg and
http://www.vintagebus.com/techinfo/eber/eb-012.jpg ?  These are more
schematics (or current flow diagrams) than wiring diagrams, but they
do tell you where things go, I think.  Be sure to look at the key on
the right side of page 12 - the numbers in the far right column match
up with the numbers along the bottom of the diagram.  Also note that
the wire colors are on the diagram as text, such as "1.0 sw/ge" for
a 1.0 mm^2 black/yellow stripe wire.  It's not as easy as the pre-70s
wiring diagrams, but the info is there if you work at it.
