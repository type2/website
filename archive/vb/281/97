Pop Rivets?
Not a good idea.
Regardless how you prep the surface around them, rust will form in time
inside the 3/16's holes, and your back to square one.

I have found the absolute best way to attach any type of steel ( or
aluminum ) panel is to use 3-M #08117 Panel Bonding Adhesive.

It not only makes for a bullet proof repair, it also displaces moisture
at the repaired area.
Simple to use too--

Grind, clean, apply adhesive, and clamp.

Done.

Stainless steel pop rivets 

1. spot weld and hope for the best 
2. forget the pop out and just go with stationary glass 
3. try and find some of that shmancy fancy glue i hear about that they
are using to "glue" cars together these days and try reattaching the
hinge that way??
