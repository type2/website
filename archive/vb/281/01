Wow, that is a long way from the Model T coil we used to use attached to the
spark plug screwed into the exhaust pipe.  Costs a bunch more too, the Model
T coils could be found for pennies and you didn't need anything other than
the T coil, spark plug, spark plug wire, switch and wire to hook everything
up.

Richen up the idle jet, sit at a stop light for a few minutes, switch on,
floor the car and monster flames out the back!!!!
