Hi Jim,
Get rid of the external cooler and install a doghouse cooler and shroud.  If 
you need more cooling go to a type 4 cooler in a modified doghouse shroud and 
Porsche generator pulley for more cooling.  Either way make sure to have a 33, 
34, or better yet a 35mm wide fan (Inside measurement)!

200mm is fine we have found that the nine spring clutch pressure plate and 
sprung disc work well for us.  Friends of our's had a 1776 SP engine and dual 
carb kept blowning up the 200mm diaphram type of pressure plates and he did not 
drag race his bus.  Once they converted to the nine spring clutch pressure 
plate they never had a problem again with the clutch.
