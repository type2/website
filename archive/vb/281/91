Probably "6".  One reference I have (Doliwa) says:

Date              Chassis  Engine
27 December 1961  879 587  6 363 693
15 January  1962  889 352  6 411 578
 6 April    1962  928 307  6 660 556

So, if you want to be really accurate, you need a case numbered after
about 6 413 000 or so.

You can write to VW and ask for the "birth certificate" of your Bus;
this information is usually on there.  It costs around EUR 15 and
the address is in http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/056110.html .

I hope this helps!
