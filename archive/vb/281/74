Subject: new ceiling wood in 61 westy

Just finished the birch ceiling in Shawn's 61 flipseat westy.  Pics up on 
vintagebus.com, search for flipseat or fliptop or westy.   Thanks to those who 
helped me figure out how it was supposed to be (the big panels were missing) 
including those who posted detailed pics of early westy interiors, and Eric & 
Barb who kindly lent me an original panel for a template, and to the weather with 
sun smiling down giving great drying conditions.

Hey, this one turned out better than the ceiling for my 65 westy.     Maybe 
I'll redo my 59 westy and then sell it all pretty instead of as a project.
