Subject: travel postcard from P&C - Arizona

Ah Time for some rest and relaxation.  

After leaving Leveland, Texas, were we stopped to help a fellow VW'er with some construction, we maneuvered through the heart of New Mexico, stopping at Valley of Fire.  Trying to stay off the dreaded freeways, we wiggled our way across Arizona and saw ShowLo and Payson before running up to Flagstaff.  We stayed with Ricky and Becky for a couple nights and prepped the busses.  

We cruised with Ricky with is hi-top and puck, to Jerome for the Volkswagen meet.  After a long weekend we went down to Cottonwood, just down the hill for a week, resting, swimming, and generally catching up.

We went out for garage sales (It all goes on HIS side of the bed) and got the bus restocked.  We also found a foam mattress for the 'colorado condo' tent trailer as the air mattress was a little tough to use.  Philip had to cut it down with his Sawz-all (he brought it - he had to use it) and Catherine sewed up the cover.  

After a week we headed over to a cousin's in Chino Valley for more fun and pinochle.  Even took a trip to Phoenix to visit more family.  

Here are the newest travel postcards.  They are posted at

Next plans are a cruise over to Albuquerque for the Busses and Balloons then we may finally be headed home.  There is a VW meet in Huntington Beach we like in mid October but not sure we can make it in time.  It still could take us three weeks to get home from New Mexico.

We were forwarded a neat satellite picture of the NY/east coast blackout this summer and wanted to pass it on.
