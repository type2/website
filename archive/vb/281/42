I have a 9-prong box (molded VW 211.952.227 B, SWF BGR 200.919; ink-
stamped 2B29) with this wire and it is indeed a ground wire.  The earlier
metal-cased boxes grounded through their mounting clip, and I think the
early plastic-cased ones grounded through their mounting screw via that
rivet that holds the box together.  To make sure this is what you have,
use an ohm meter to measure between that brown wire and the rivet; you
should get 0 ohms or very close to it.

The box will "probably" work just fine if you just put the screw through
the mounting hole, but if you want to be sure, ground the ground wire as
well.  If you end up not using the ground wire, make sure it is secured
so it can't flop against any of the other terminals of the box.  If you
want to hook up the ground wire, the ring terminal is good for a small
screw, or you can extend the ground wire with another length of wire
with a male push-on attached.
