Looks like Kelly will have to train a few more metal fabricators. I have seen
his work on the web page and that's what the rest of, not the NOS, people
need!

That's a good scenario question.  If the worlds stock of aircooled vw
parts were going to be gone in 5 years what parts would you stash away
to keep your bus running.  I just can't imagine life without that
aircooled purr.
