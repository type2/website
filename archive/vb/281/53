Hi Josh,
That will work, but make sure to use nails that are not galvanized.  
Otherwise you can affect or even kill your liver with the fumes.  We have welded up 
small 1/4" or smaller holes with just the wire feed welder we have.  Either way 
take your time and do not over heat one are which will cause warping of the 
sheet metal.
