The literature I have found about the SW calls for the pump to put out
about 5-9psi.

After I got it in fine working order mine doesn't seem to really have
any noticable black smoke. It did have more smoke when the combustion
fan did not turn fast enough. Try drilling a small hole in the motor.
There is a felt spacer thing in there. Soak it in elec motor oil for a
day through the hole. it will help that motor a LOT.
