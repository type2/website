Few people are aware of the M-series designations for both Sauerbraten 
and Wienerschnitzel (used with the mesh grey interior), which of course 
changed slightly from 63 to 64 when they went from "small-butt" to 
"big-butt" versions.  A number of coachworks supplied one-off aromatics 
such as HundertLagers mit Bratwurst, which is highly sought after.  
Using contemporary repops like Pulled Pork and, of course, Baked Beans 
-- the NAPA of replacement seat scent sources -- marks you as a 
plebeian and will make most purists hold their noses.

Thanks for reminding us of those finer details that separate the 
hobbyist from the mere driver, Craig. ;-)  (I laughed so hard I 
inadvertently dosed my recliner.)
