Subject: wanted: truck rear pillar lower part

Hi All,

 

Anyone have a sc or dc that is beyond repair but has decent rear pillar
supports?  I'm in need of the lower 3-6 inches of both left and right
supports . I have a picture of what I'm looking for on my parts im
wanting web page:

. or maybe someone can tell me if the lower portion of that support is
the same as for a bus???  Which means I'd take anything.

 

1959 is the year if that makes a difference.

 

TIA

 

 

David
