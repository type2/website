..but have you /used/ a TIG?  You might want to try it before you buy
it...it's an entirely different experiance.

(adjust voltage with your foot, maintain proper electrode-to-work distance
with one hand, feed the rod in with your other, and move both hands along
your work at a steady pace...did I mention the water-cooled electrode?)


I'll stick with a MIG for most of my work, and fall back to a stick for
the big stuff.
