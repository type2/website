Billy,

Check out this page at longenterprises.com, my favorite tranny man:

Yes, you disassemble the RGBs first, and when the upper main axle is
released from the upper bearing, etc, then the rest of the assembly will
pull off of the axle. You use two circlip pliers to remove and install the
required circlips. The larger one is a Proto #394, the smaller one can be
bought at most good hardware stores - get an american made one,
SearsCraftsman or better, as any cheapo tools will break, and you'll end
up buying the good ones anyway.

The axle tube is pressed into the RGB, and you undo the nuts at the side
cover on the center section.
