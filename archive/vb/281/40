Subject: Re: [VB] Planning ahead for 2004

I will be making calendars again this year in PDF form so if you want your
bus in a calendar get a picture or 2 to me and I will include them.  I did a
bunch of these calendars last year and they were a big hit so let me have
your best VW bus pic and I will work them in before the end of the year
