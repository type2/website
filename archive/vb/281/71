Subject: trans replacement questions #1

Ronnie, All,

Began swapping trans in earnest this weekend.

Found out that the loud banging I had described to the list earlier was not the trans, but the splines inside my passenger rear drum being ground flat!

Any ideas on that?

Putting in the new trans from type2parts.com anyway for good measure.

I believe you have to work from the RGB's to get the axles off the trans case, correct?  I'm using Mike Gensler's write up in the type2 library as my main reference for lack of a Bentley as of yet.

RGB's are split, is it the upper-outer bearing that is removed? I tood a circlip off of a bearing and I believe that was the one.

I hear these bearings are expensive and mine look brand new, so I don't want to destroy them. I bought a 3 arm puller that I will probably have to grind down to fit between the bearing and gear behind it. Is there any better/easier way to do this job?

thanks,

Billy
