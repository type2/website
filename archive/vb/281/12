Subject: Rock'N'Roll seat blueprints

I'm re-building(not restoring!) a 67 Panel and I want
to put a Rock'N'Roll bed in the back.
However there are a couple of problems.
I live in Australia & the only Westfalias that ever
got here imported by owners.
As such getting spares for them is prohibitively
expensive and as well no one imports the aftermarket
items either.
Does anyone know where I could get blue prints for a
Rock'N'Roll bed of suitable size to fit in a '67 so I
could get a local machinist/metal shop to make it up
he parts for me?
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
