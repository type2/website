Subject: re: Tailgaters

Some tailgaters are people using you as cruise control to keep them from falling 
off the edge of the earth. You'll see 'em on cell phones. 




I hit the brake lights if they're too close. Practice a bit with someone or a 
reflective wall behind you so you know when they come on. 




On a freeway, let'em get around you. I figure they won't get the speeding ticket 
they so richly deserve at the speeds I'm going! Like Tom and Ray Magliozzi said, 
it's not our job to give them driving lessons.
