John,

Just one more on the side of a good gas unit.  I have a Miller 130 and
it does everything I ever need, though I don't ever need to do thick
stuff.  Never any splatter issues, though I wish I could have had finer
heat control.  The 130 has 5 big steps on its heat range with an
infinite range of wire speed.

That said, I'll step up and say if I had to do it over I'd of spent the
money for a good TIG welder.  Then I could do stainless, aluminum, and
very clean steel welds with almost NO clean up or grinding.  The next
one for me will be a TIG.

Steve
