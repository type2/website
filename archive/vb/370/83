Subject: Re: [VB] Best way to polish jalousie windows? 

OK, I try not to pop up with the "been there- done that" posts but here goes
anyway...

Check the archives of the detailed articles that I have written regarding
careful, common sense disassembly and polishing of the various varieties of
jalousie windows.

Bottom line:

Stock appearance was a non-shiny bare aluminum look.
Polished? Yes, I agree- not stock but they look better.

Cut the crap and take them to a professional polisher. Seek out and use the
guys/gals who do the polishing for the motorcycle parts. You will save HOURS,
knuckles, the price that you pay for various products and get your items
polished the way that you envision and get your rig back on the road sooner
than if you endlessly d*ck around and come up part way to your goal.

Learn that sometimes it make sense to hire out the tasks that you wish to
accomplish.

"Been there- done that- and have the knuckle scars and stains to prove it".

OK, now go back to discussing how I dont know **** and you can do that better.

Professional polishing is accomplished via industrial buffers using
speeds/products and horse power that our fingers and $30. bench grinders will
never achieve. Discuss with your pro-vendor regarding coating with "clear" to
preserve that just-done shine. (I never did and the items remained shiny enough
for me). You may be surprised at how quickly and relatively inexpensively you
can accomplish your task.

Quad ought (0000) steel wool, Mother's Polish and Simichrome can and do result
in pretty good results.... eventually and only to a point.

Good luck,
Jim Ellis
