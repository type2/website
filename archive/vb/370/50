Internet gaming companies continue to book record 
numbers each year.  Revenues from Internet gaming
operators are expected to soar from 12 billion this 
year to 24.5 billion in 2010, according to Christiansen 
Capital Advisors, a Maine-based consulting firm.

Despite great numbers, much of the online gambling
industry has missed the largest Target Market in the 
world, India and China, with a combined Population 
of over 2.5 billion people.

Taj Systems is targeting the Indian market first
with the release of a popular form of poker among 
Indians called, Teen Patti (3-card poker), which has 
had virtually no Internet presence until today.

LoboGaming Corporation, a subsidiary of Taj Systems, 
recently launched a new poker site (lobopoker.com) 
and already boasts a customer base that spans 6 
continents and 32 countries within its first 3 months of 
operations.  Gustavo Morales, CEO of LoboGaming, 
believes their most recent software development of the 
popular Indian poker game, TeenPatti, should bring in 
an excess of 25,000 players using the site before the end 
of the year.
