Subject: Re: [VB] Wheel question 15" vs. 14" on my 1963

If you use a 185R14 tire [same as later bay size] you will find that a 195/70R15 tire on a 15" wheel is almost
the identical tire size.

Go here: http://www.miata.net/garage/tirecalc.html
and put 185 80 14 on the left [a tire with no middle aspect number is a 82 series tire] and 195 70 15 on the
right, you will see the difference.

[A LOT of tire salespeople think you mean 185/75R14 when you say 185R14 because they don't realize there is
such a thing as 185R14!! The 75 series tire is too small. Enter it on the right and you will see the
difference]

Here is a good explanation of tires:
