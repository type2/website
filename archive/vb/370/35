Subject: RE: [VB] I need some valuable input...?

One point when disputing a CC charge.
Contact the seller/retailer one last time, and be explicit that you are
trying to resolve the issue "IN GOOD FAITH".  Then when talking with the CC
company, you can say that you tried to resolve the issue 'in good faith'.
That term seems to be key when attempting to resolve disputes.  I'm not
exactly sure but I think that terminology is specifically stated in your CC
agreement so, if you do it, then I think it cuts down on some of the leg
work.

	For what it's worth all the times that I bring that phrase up,  the
retailers seem to understand that I'm serious and then the issue gets
resolved.
