Subject: Unitentional Spam> "Invite" to IM list NOT intended

Am *COMPLETELY* sorry for any potential spam invite to any instant messaging
groups.

I responded to an invite sent by my nephew. Next thing that I knew - I had
"invited" everyone in my email book.

VERY sorry as I have been intentionally been attempting a low profile.
