Subject: Re: [VB] Best way to polish jalousie windows?

Taking the windows out to polish is the best for not mucking up the
surrounding windows..

I have used fine steel wool and Autosol.... finishing off with polishing
wheels on a Dremel. Shines up beyond factory....

 What's the best way to clean them up?  I am using Mothers
> Polish, but I am not making much difference.
