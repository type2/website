Subject: Re: [VB] Best way to polish jalousie windows?

Glad that I can help. Seeking out the advice and services of a professional may
or may not end up being "expensive". Yes, professionals in any career field
ought to be compensated but ~just maybe~ a trade/broker/"kind-deed" or whatever
may exist as a possibility. I think that I paid about $90. to have all of the
parts of the "show bus" polished but that pile also included a bunch of other
items too... cant recall perhaps roofrack pieces.

My '63 EZ camper had the Sundial single thick frame top hinge type of windows.
I told the same polisher that they didnt need to be Harley crowd show stopper
quality but good enough for camping and to generally look good. A liquid trade
and perhaps a cigar at that time reduced the invoice radically.

Never assume that a door is locked until you try to open it. Perhaps
opportunities exist just for the effort of trying. Give it a shot and- yes, go
camping and park with friends in the swaps at shows. More fun has been
experienced from my vantage point from those choices than from the hassles in
the show display areas. =) Most of the time it's more important to show up than
to be in the show...
I have not had the time to do either for too long. The wind has been whispering
"Havasu" to me lately. Time will tell.

when searching the archives you might check for the terms RFH and VanBondo.
Both were associated to me about 13 years ago already... <sigh>
Best wishes to all
