Subject: Size of 58 Cab vs. later split windows...

Would anyone know if the cab section or seat set up is any larger or 
smaller than that of a later years split bus? Is it an issue of bench seat 
versus walk-thru?
  I was wondering cause I just drove a 58 panel w/ benchseat and I had a 
tough time driving comfortable as compared to my 67 walk-thru? I'm 6'2" so 
it is kind of an issue if I were to get this older bus.... Everything else 
sure seems cool though! Thanks! JD
