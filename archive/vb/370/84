Subject: Re: [VB] Best way to polish jalousie windows?

Jim,
Thanks for the comments.  I always check the archives and my search did 
not obtain the necessary info that I wanted.  Now that I have a 
reference (your name) I'll be able to pull up your detailed articles.  I 
appreciate your efforts and time to help other VW enthusiasts.
After spending hours yesterday on one jalousie, I got some good results, 
but the frame still has places that need work. Between teaching, 
coaching, raising two girls, and my VW addiction, my time is valuable, I 
will search out a professional.  I may not use one because off the cost 
( face it private school teachers are not wealthy ;0).  This is a bus 
that I drive and camp in and not a show bus, so depending on time vs 
money, I'll make my decision.  Thanks again for your input.

Joy Thru Air,
