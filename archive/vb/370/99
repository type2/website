JD -
 Seat Runners to make all the front seats adjustable were introduced in the
63 Model year (Vin 971 550), so this probably why yer a bit uncomfortable. I
had the same problem with a 61 Panel & 59 Euro Single Cab PU I both use to
own. After a hunnert miles or so, time get out and stretch yer legs (I'm
5'9").
 Note: Adjustable Seat Runners were on the M80 & M81 optional walk thrus
thru 1962.
 Now my ex-67 Deluxe 21 Wdw Walk Thru was such a pleasure to drive around
when I switched back and forth between the two at the time (86-93).
