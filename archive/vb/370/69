 Unfortunately, ETKA doesn't cover the Type 2 thru 1967, never has. That
portion died a quiet death when the dealer microfiche(s) was converted to the Electronic Catalog format. You
might wanna check Thom's site to see if he has a link to someone who has scanned the "print" VW Parts catalog
and has it hosted somewhere. I remember someone a long time ago (Matt Roberds?) scanned the parts book - I
just don't know where it's at on the web.  ETKA does show the Type 1, Type 2 68-79 and Vanagon Aircooled stuff
though, but listings are not as near as complete as the books or microfiche(s). That's why I kept my library
intact when ETKA came along.
