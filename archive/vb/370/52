Subject: Wheel question 15" vs. 14" on my 1963

Hi list--

I am starting to look at getting new tires for my recently bought
Panel. I have a March 1963 (VIN#1077700) bus which should have 15"
wheels according to the FAQ at vintagebus.com.** The bus is in rough
shape but has a lot of original parts so I'm not expecting anything
non-stock here.

But, the current tires are all 14" tires (P185/75/R14, except the
spare bolted to the front, which is P195/75/R14). The wheels then must
be 14" wheels.

Why would someone replace the original wheels with 14" wheels? What is
the advantage to a slightly smaller wheel size? Is it worth it for me
to seek out a set of correct 15" wheels before I buy a new set of
tires? What are the handling or performance implications?

Do the same hubcaps fit on both sizes?

**after writing most of this message, I double-checked my Bentley
manual. Page B-11 states that the 1 ton capacity transporters were
fitted with 14" tires and the 3/4 ton with 15" (prior to December
1963). So apparently I have a 1 ton vehicle, not surprising since its
a commercial. The same questions remain, however: what are the
implications if I go to a 15" wheel? I much prefer a narrower look and
I will not be hauling around 2000lbs worth of anything. Is this
possible, or do I have to replace more than just the rims?

Head spinning along with my wheels...
