Subject: Re: [VB] Help installing ceiling panels

Hi Jamie,

I got a set from Clara too. She pointed out to me that the web site
has an installation tips page I hadn't noticed:

http://home.comcast.net/~sunrisebus/install.html

In email she also suggested to me that because of the severity of the
bend that it might help to put them in part way one day to let the
panels start taking the curve, and then finish up another day.
