A chargeback is definitely a good option. For legal action, call your
state dept of consumer affairs for your other options. A small claims
action in Hawaii would be difficult for them to contest also. Your
mechanic may be a good witness since he has another customer with a
bad SCAT.

 problem, honestly - but the rest sounds like build issues. if you
 paid by credit card, contest the charge!  often that will get results
