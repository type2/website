Hi Garrick,

I'm not sure why they decided to go with smaller wheels on the heavier
bus unless they thought the greater weight needed more shock
absorbtion with more rubber, or maybe they thought they could provide
a more economical product with cheaper tires. But according to the
tire article at gowesty.com you get a shorter sidewall with a 15 inch
wheel which they claim is better stability and better handling.
