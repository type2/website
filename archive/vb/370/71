Subject: Re: [VB] Best way to polish jalousie windows?

Jaimie,

I removed mine from the vehicle and hosed them off in a bead blaster. It 
took off all the old icky corrosion. I also had to replace a couple of 
rivets. I then painted the frames with Rustoleum aluminum paint. The trick 
is to overcoat the aluminum paint with a good clear coat. Otherwise the 
aluminum paint rubs off. I Have many a question at the meets as to where I 
got the new jelousies. I then have to explain that these are the original 
windows!! Of course the glass is new. I had a local glass shop cut new solid 
panes from 3/16 material and then had them tempered.

PS, did you ever get the photo of the ceiling panels?
