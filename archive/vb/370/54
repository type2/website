Subject: Re: [VB] Wheel question 15" vs. 14" on my 1963

From Detroit Bus:

 **after writing most of this message, I double-checked my Bentley
 manual. Page B-11 states that the 1 ton capacity transporters were
 fitted with 14" tires and the 3/4 ton with 15" (prior to December
 1963). So apparently I have a 1 ton vehicle, not surprising since its
 a commercial. The same questions remain, however: what are the
 implications if I go to a 15" wheel? I much prefer a narrower look and
 I will not be hauling around 2000lbs worth of anything. Is this
 possible, or do I have to replace more than just the rims?

 Head spinning along with my wheels...

And you believe you have a 1 tonner because a previous owner put 15" wheels on it??

There is more to it than that.

Do you have a 1500 emblem on the rear? [I don't believe there were any 1200 1 tonners?]

Do you have M code M 215?  [THAT is the M code for 1500 engine AND 1 ton]

What is the ratio marked on the back of your speedometer?!!!!!
A bus that used 15" wheels will have W0,77 stamped on the back.
A bus that used 14" wheels will have W0,80 stamped on the back.
It will be stamped into the back of the speedo. The blue paint number is the build date.


After writing the above, I decided to check the www.type2.com archives and found these after doing a search on
'1 ton':

This post says "5 Aug 1963    1 144 303: 1 ton version available"
which is WAY past your vin of  1 077 700!

And this one makes it sound like you are supposed to have 15" wheels, no ifs, ands, or buts :
