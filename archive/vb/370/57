Hi Garrick,
  Probably because as the years passed the 14" rim got easier to  find.  Plus 
instead of taking all the time, trouble, and $$ to have  the old rims 
painted, the DPO found some nicer looking later rims.
A smaller wheel size reduces the radial dimension, which means less  leverage 
against the brakes used.  Handling and performance are really not  going to 
change between the two dimensions especially for the bus.   Handling and 
performance are most affected by tire selection!

>>Do the same hubcaps fit on both sizes? <<
 
Yes.
