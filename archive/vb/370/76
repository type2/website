>have you tried mothers with steel wool?

I used steel wool on mine, progressively through four finer grades (down
to 0000, if I remember right).  No polishing compounds, but elbow grease
(and a dust mask).  Came out looking pretty shiny, and didn't really
take too long - maybe a couple minutes at each grade for each window.
