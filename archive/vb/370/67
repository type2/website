Unfortunately, ETKA doesn't cover the Type 2 thru 1967, never has. That
portion died a quiet death when the dealer microfiche(s) was converted to
the Electronic Catalog format. You might wanna check Thom's site to see if
he has a link to someone who has scanned the "print" VW Parts catalog and
has it hosted somewhere. I remember someone a long time ago (Matt Roberds?)
scanned the parts book - I just don't know where it's at on the web.
 ETKA does show the Type 1, Type 2 68-79 and Vanagon Aircooled stuff though,
but listings are not as near as complete as the books or microfiche(s).
That's why I kept my library intact when ETKA came along.
