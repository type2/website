The longer studs are for the bottom the shorter ones
are for the top ones, the engine will not have the 8mm
studs if they are pulling out because the 8mm studs
are put in with the steel case saver inserts and they
won't pull out, with that said the engine must have
the 10mm studs. This is where I put my foot in my
mouth, I have never seen a 8mm stud pull out of a
case. Just be sure to strip out all the old threads
before starting the Super Stud into the hole, just
lock two nuts together on it and screw it in, to the
right depth, break the nuts loose take them off put a
washer on with the head nut, and torque them all down. Phil
