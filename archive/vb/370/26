All,

Great feedback, thanks!  I will use a bigger series resistor and
incorporate one in parallel in the next version.  I hadn't given much
thought to the amount of heat dissipated by the resistors, so the
epoxy idea is out.

It's true there are companies that sell ready-made LEDs for this
application, but as Matt said, it's more fun to roll your own.  And I
imagine it might be difficult to find them in anything but white.  Now
that you can buy LEDs that emit long-wave UV, you could get the
'blacklight poster' effect from your speedometer and be the envy of
all the civic tuners in your neighborhood :-)
