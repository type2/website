Alas, I have no M-code plate; which is why I asked for help from the
list! There are only two rudely torn bolt holes and an impression
where the plate once was.

I'll check both speedometers that came with the bus (hmmm...now that
becomes more interesting). I think the original is in a box out back
somewhere. Thanks for the help.

Are there any other foolproof ways to determine original
configuration, short of getting a "birth certificate" from VW?
