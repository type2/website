Subject: [VB] New Listee Sticker Submission

Oops, looks like Beto beat me to the front! I'd like to submit this
anyway
since I've got some time into it. NEATO decided not to use my logo, but
I'd
like to see my bus illustration getting use somewhere. If not for a list
sticker, then maybe a future project.

Here's my link:
