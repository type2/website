Subject: Re: [VB] Balancing Tires-For What It's Worth

Now for an old story about balancing the rims without (only 8 mm hole) center
hole.  The 'old tire man' had the car up and the door nearest the wheel wide
open, ran the tire up to speed with an external spinner.  Now for the VooDoo he
just watched it slow down added a weight -- now spin again very close in
balance, move the weight a little, spin again and right on balance.  He did this
on all four tires with only one or two spins each.  We could not believe it
worked. Now that is talent!
