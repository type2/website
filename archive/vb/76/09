Whichever of these neat methods you choose, I suggest using
thread-locking fluid when screwing in the stud to the case. It'll seal and
hold the stud in. I've managed to do this twice in my VW-life (29 years),
and each time the locking fluid helped insure the repair.

Be sure to make the thread surfaces oil-free before using the fluid.
