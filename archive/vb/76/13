>you sound so industrious Craig.  Wow.

no, just determined! i even took 3 hours out for a doctor's appointment
that i had to ride my bike to :)

i was furious the other day when i had to bum a ride to work from my
neighbor... it was cold and raining, and my bus wouldn't even roll down the
driveway; the NEW carb that i had put on the night before was ENCASED in
ice :P    too wet to bike.
first time in 5 years the bus had let me down, tho.

now, i had completely cleaned the heat riser when it was installed a year
ago, but i have been having such trouble with carbs running overrich that i
imagine it just coked up doubletime.
took it out, and ran a clutch cable thru it for an hour or so, until it
would go in one end and out the other.  i'm talkin c l e a n.
when it was all back together, car srtarted right up...  and danged if
there wasn't condensation on that carb riser :P
at least it wasn;t ice, tho it was nearly cold enough for it.
i have the thermostat set up, and i have a preheat hose to the aircleaner.
so i guess my car just likes to set a spell until its REALLY warm before i
take off, or i'll have some mild stumbling due to carb icing.

might wrap the heater tube with muffler tape, too.

other than that, it ran dandy... i'll have to see what my milage is.
the new 30pict1 set me back $150, but it really made a difference.  nice to
have a non-used part once in a while.
