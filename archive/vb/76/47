Subject: engine trouble, part 2

well, i tried putting metal (doubled over coke can slivers) under the heat
riser/muffler junction, but that did not do anything noticeable as far as
nullifying a vacuum leak through the heat riser. so i guess next week i'll
try another manifold i know is good and see what happens. unfortunately the
engine is "too clean" to do the non removal of engine thing--wouldn't want
to scratch all the shiny tin!
thanks for all the suggestions.
