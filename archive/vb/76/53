Subject: [VB] New Listee Sticker Submission


Oops, looks like Beto beat me to the front! I'd like to submit this anyway
since I've got some time into it. NEATO decided not to use my logo, but I'd
like to see my bus illustration getting use somewhere. If not for a list
sticker, then maybe a future project.

Here's my link:

Back on the list after a long slumber.
