 Can the springs themselves be changed to alter the pressure settings?

you can get 'heavy duty springs'  but really what that does is not much.  it 
sends the oil flow through the cooler  when with a regular spring it would 
bypass the cooler.   so if you are driving with the oil warm enough to pass 
through the cooler it makes absolutely no difference at all.   would maybe 
make it take a little longer to warm up the oil, but its a waste of time, 
stick with the stock springs.

oh ya, ahve heard of people pulling the springs out to 'get more pressure' 
and getting ballooned oil coolers.
