  It's OK Dave I'm trailering my 15 window down there and I'm sure I'll hear
about it. It's just between all my swap stuff, 10 tranny cores and a few
crates of cranks and rods it would take me a full day to drive there and my
roof rack wouldn't hold it all.

ps. I might even bring some cut off bus sheet metal and who knows what else

Ok, so, maybe I will/should trailer it for longer distance shows... like if
I could ever get it to Octo... and then, if I do, I'll have to get one of
those shirts that says:

'I trailered mine so F*CK OFF'

Ronnie thinks that I'll only drive it "and on and off the trailer  :) "
