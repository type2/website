Subject: Re: [VB] New Listee Sticker Submission

Well, guys...I really like Everett's graphic.  I had done a detailed graphic 
that was similar and the vinyl guy had a lot of trouble with the details, 
since the stickers were small.

I am having 100 made to start out, and will have at least 50 for OCTO.  I 
would like it if some OCTO attendees would post comments once the stickers 
are seen in person. I am likely looking at selling them for 3 bucks....5 
tops...dependent upon the final price from the vinyl guy.  They are a two 
color sticker and have to be layered...thus the higher price.

They are approx. 5" wide by 2.5" tall.  Black and white.  They actually came 
out pretty cool because the windows are cut out so you can see through them.

I will finalize all the mailing/money info this weekend.  So keep you eyes 
peeled and I should mail some out next week.

I am really thinking about doing few various models (SC,DC,23,etc, etc)

So we'll have to see once I get a little more time.  First think is to work 
on the baywindow sticker for the type2 list.

I will keep you guys updated.....and If you want to see something 
different..let me know.  

Always open to suggestions...criticisms.....

Thanks for all the kind remarks...
