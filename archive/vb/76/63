Subject: Look for My Sweet Bus on NBC

Colleagues of the vintage variety:

Look for "MSB" on NBC over the next two weeks!  NBC will be
broadcasting the Olys, and I live a 1 iron shot away from the Peaks
Arena in Provo, where the women's hockey rounds are being played.  NBC
is broadcasting 15 of 24 games being played here, including the hot
contest between the Ruskies and Finland, two teams loaded with NHL
stars.

There will be exterior shots of the mountains and the valley.  Look for
the Y on the mountain.  Look for My Sweet Bus parked on the street in
front of my house, when they do the airial pan of the city from the
helio.  Most of these will be on CNBC.

Keep ur eyes peeled.  She's white and '57 Chev aqua marine, a common
type2 retro color, I know.  23 window, white rag top.  

Curt . . . soon to be rich and famous
