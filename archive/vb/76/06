i just took out/replaced the SP manifold today - engine IN car!
no trouble at all. i also replaced my gen brushes, cleaned out the heat
riser, and put in a NEW carb. finished just in time to turn the key and
drive across town for the local veedub club meeting!

if the motor had been out, it would still be sitting there, with me under
it, wrestling it in, until after the meeting.

score one for the half-assed way :)
