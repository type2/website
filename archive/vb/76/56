Subject: Daisy, VW Bus Song???

On the local community radio station, KXCI, here in Tucson I heard a
love song about a VW bus called Daisy.  In the song there is a narrative
first from the Daisy's owner's point of view and then from Daisy's.  The
song caught my attention as it begins with an aircooled VW engine
revving up and then driving off.  Daisy is by a group which I think is
called Tongue (and, &, ?) Groove.  Anyone on the list know this song?
