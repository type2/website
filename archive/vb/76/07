 i just took out/replaced the SP manifold today - engine IN car!
 no trouble at all. i also replaced my gen brushes, cleaned out the heat
 riser, and put in a NEW carb. finished just in time to turn the key and
 drive across town for the local veedub club meeting!
 
 if the motor had been out, it would still be sitting there, with me under
 it, wrestling it in, until after the meeting.
 
 score one for the half-assed way :)

only time I swapped the manifold on a sp in situ was in the 53, wasn't sure 
if there was room to do it in one of the small engine compartment buses.   :)

you sound so industrious Craig.  Wow.
