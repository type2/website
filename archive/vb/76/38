Subject: List T-shirt information

  Howdy. With all this talk of list stickers, I thought I'd go ahead and mention that I'll be doing the annual spring printing of the type2 and vintagebus Official List T-Shirts in a few weeks. (I do have a couple hundred of the second generation list stickers left, if anyone wants them for the historical value- they are NOS after all...)
 Anyway, Go to my page
http://www.teamSpatula.com 
and go to the t-shirt page to see pictures of the list shirt, Air Cooled Search & Rescue Team shirts, a couple other designs I have for sale, and a couple historic list shirt pictures including the very first one from 1995, when all generations of bussers lived happily under the Vanagon(-at-)lenti roof...
   I will have the artwork for the EVERYBUS 2002 shirts up in a week or two as soon as I get it ready.
    I'll start taking pre-orders around the end of February. I'm headed out of town tomorrow for 2 weeks, but will post pre-order information as soon as I get back.
Thanks, and happy Friday
