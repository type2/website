Subject: Re: [VB] Balancing Tires-For What It's Worth

The two Costcos in Tucson have the big hole tire balancing adaptors.
Their tire mechanics and equipment seem to be a huge cut above the
average tire shop.  I also see the same employees at Costco's tire dept
from year to year.   That may be telling us something useful....
