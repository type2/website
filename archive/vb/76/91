supposed to go by my orifice(sic) this pm!!!  They're in the garage where
they're supposed to be cuz its cold, snowy, salty roads, etc and there are
more federales around here than you can pass a baton to.  In any event, I
have been thinking of a scheme to get my bus its 15 minutes of fame (other
than Everett's site!) during the Games, but alas, it's quicker to walk
around here than drive the bus anywhere.  Supposed to be 14 degrees tonight
at the opening ceremonies!
I'm sure it'll look beautiful!

Just hoping they use buses in the ceremonies instead of covered wagons and
hand carts, but i'm not keeping my fingers crossed!
