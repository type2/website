Subject: Iron Cross emblem / lowering light bulbs

For all the listees that have emailed me about the emblem. I will post
here when I have them with pictures, price, etc. I wasn't planning on
selling any, just having a few for myself, guess I'll have to rethink
that as well.

I'll keep everyone "posted"

Greg "not lowering the wattage of the light bulbs, but body dropping
them. That way they look lower but still perform as originally designed"
