The OCTO is Sunday 10 February you will have to work very fast, maybe
someone in the bay area will bring them down. LOL
P & C

I am having 100 made to start out, and will have at least 50 for OCTO.
I
would like it if some OCTO attendees would post comments once the
stickers
are seen in person. I am likely looking at selling them for 3 bucks....5

tops...dependent upon the final price from the vinyl guy.  They are a
two
color sticker and have to be layered...thus the higher price.

They are approx. 5" wide by 2.5" tall.  Black and white.  They actually
came
out pretty cool because the windows are cut out so you can see through
them.
