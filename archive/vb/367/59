Subject: Re: [VB] Found a Double Cab/ Mark Rupert on List?

You going to keep or sale?  I'm starting to look for a doulble door panel or
camper (or a Kombi to make a camper) if u run across one reasonable let me
know.  Also if I can get a deal on a Crewcab I'd maybe give up the DD.
Thought I'd found a 15 window I could buy and trade for add.
