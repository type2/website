Subject: 50th anniversary poster

When we stopped by Autohaus VW in Lancaster Pennsylvania a couple days 
ago we got to see the new 50th anniversary poster with the beetles, 
ghias, trucks, and things in the form of a '50' within a circle.  We 
grabbed a snapshot of the poster then identified the vehicle from the 
Herbie & friends cruise across America tour.  There were two type 2s at 
the bottom of the circle.
