No such animal.  Metric bolts have property classes like 8.8 (just a
tiny bit stronger than SAE Grade 5) or 10.9 (just a tiny bit stronger
than SAE Grade 8).  Sometimes the "8.8" on the head of a metric bolt
gets confused with a "Grade 8" SAE bolt.

The most common metric bolts at the hardware store are 8.8.  In new cars,
8.8 is pretty common, while 10.9 and 12.9 bolts get used in some high-load
applications.

I think that's more like a dye that is applied to make it easier to
identify the bolt as metric when you spill the bolt bin on the floor.
I've bought several metric bolts at the hardware store that had a
greenish tint.
