Subject: Re: [VB] Re: 2/3 middle seat

Here is a pic of my seat - I'd sure like to know what year it came from?  So 
is it true that walk through buses had 2/3's middle seats - and bench seat 
buses had full width middle seats?  If I can't trade this one for the 
correct seat maybe I ought to just recover it to match my interior - I'll 
have to recover both my front and back seats anyway.

In my 60 the pleats on the seats are stitched - but on the new seat the 
pleats are kinda pressed in with heat (I forget the term).  When did the go 
from stitched to pressed in?
