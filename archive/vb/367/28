Good call. There is a product by Loctite called Master Gasket and Master
Gasket Primer. I am looking at a data sheet. It claims gap filling
capablility up to .050 with a tensile strength of 1900 psi. It is spec'ed
from -65 to 300 F.  Can be put into service in 20 minutes.  That is quite
strong and will hold the kind of pressure found in an automobile engine.
