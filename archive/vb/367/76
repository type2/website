Subject: 66 bus pop-outs

I need to buy some pop-outs for my DC, and I've found 
a number of places that sell them.

I've never had to order repop stuff, and I've heard the 
pop-outs and safari's seem to be difficult to get exactly 
right.

I also have 6 original VW pop-outs of "questionable 
restorability."

Are there any other opinions? 

Thanks,
Paul
