Haven't bought one, but judging by the number of riceboys I see around
here (Tulsa, OK) with blue headlights, green turn signals, clear tail-
light lenses with colored bulbs that emit about 10% of the light of
stock, I wouldn't worry about it.

If you do get H4s, stick with the "normal" H4 lamps that are 60 W or so.
There are 80 W and 100 W versions but all these will do is melt your
wiring harness and blow fuses.

The thing that got me hassled by the man more than anything was a flaky
(stock) right rear tail-light, until I fixed the ground and the
connections.  Long hair on the driver and a bum tail light are sure signs
that a Bus contains eighteen million dollars worth of ganja.
