Subject: Re: [VB] Axle boots

 I just use the big hose clamps.   
 

was writ:
Tonight tried my first ever change of axle boots on a swing axle.
Could not get the clamp to close enough to secure it.

Any tricks to this, or does it take a special tool? Thought maybe some armor all would wet things up to let it slip better
to take up slack. If no other ideas I will just go to hose clamps.
