>Why not just use silicone sump plate gaskets?<

Good idea!  Next time I order from ac.net I am getting some then :)

The pisser for me is that my 1.5qt sump gasket is weaping a hair.... Grrr!  
Annoying problem, I coated it very well with Permatex aviation gasket sealer 
as well to no avail.

Take Care,
