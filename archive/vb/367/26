All,

I recalled that the late Carroll Smith had a note on gasket goop in one
of his books.  I looked it up; he says he uses Loctite Gasket Eliminator
#515 and sometimes Loctite or Permatex high-temp silicone sealer as a
backup.  He says that #515 used with Loctite Primer N will fill voids up
to 0.050".  Both surfaces have to be clean (like with brake cleaner) and
dry before applying the goop.  Just another data point.
