Subject: re:questions about aftermarket stuff

This is exactly what got me pulled over about two weeks ago!

Was writ:
The thing that got me hassled by the man more than anything was a flaky
(stock) right rear tail-light, until I fixed the ground and the connections.
Long hair on the driver and a bum tail light are sure signs that a Bus
contains eighteen million dollars worth of ganja.
