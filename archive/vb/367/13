Subject: 2/3 middle seat

So I found a turquoise middle seat over the weekend.  It has vinyl covered 
handles about the back and an arm rest on the door side.  Vinyl is MINT - 
well - it's dirty but not a single tear or rip or hole - but piping is loose 
about 2" on the east part.  The bracket that the ashtray is there but not 
the ash tray.

So what years did this thing go in?

Anyone want to trade if for a 60 middle seat in comparable shape :)
