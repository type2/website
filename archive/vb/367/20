I got a 2/3 middle seat out of a tuquois 64 deluxe about twenty years 
ago (I got the whole bus for $35.00!). My seat is all one color, 
turquois, and the vinyl is smooth with lines pressed into it spaced 
about an inch apart. If my seat is a typical '64 seat, then it looks 
like yours must be out of an earlier bus. All the other seats in the 
deluxe were covered with the same stuff.
