Subject: WTB-Table for so-34 Westfalia

WANTED Table top for `61-`65 so-34 Westfalia
camper.

Hi Folks, Just picked up a cool `62 so-34 westfalia
flip seat camper.  It is all there except the darn
table top.  If anyone knows of one or has any
leads...I am willing to pay top dollar or trade for
some cool westy stuff.  I have some so-34 stuff to
trade as well...will make you a GREAT deal.

Thanks 
Todd
