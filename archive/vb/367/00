IIRC, Bob liked the hylomar spray.  I use a thin smear of RTV on both
sides of the gaskets, which is a mess but I don't drop the sump plate
very often and it doesn't leak.

While we're on the subject of chemicals, does anyone know of a retail
source for Ate brake cylinder paste?   I found a part number and MSDS
on their web site, but am having a hard time finding anyone that sells
the stuff here in the US.
