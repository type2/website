Subject: Re: [VB] $99,000 Westy 

The best bus that I had was a rat 1957 "Psuedo-Euro" single cab that I got with
a splitcase, the handcrank and 36hp (whether it was correct or not)and
semaphores. Bondo a mile thick hidden under rattlecan red iron oxide primer.
Bought a tilt and canvas from a neat old man for $75.00. Drove that bus for
many years until I completed a restoration on a 67 Westy.

That Westy, as John D indicated, was nice but - in a sense was a pigsear/silk
purse. Kind of a PITA to live up to all that I wanted it to be ~or what it
became. Perhaps a good lesson in life was learned during that phase.
What is important is family, friends who stick by us which/whatever our
finances happen to be (up or down) and a good daily driver. 

Homes; property; savings; trophy spouse or not; perceived trophy job/career or
not; and trophy vehicles... None of them mean jack if we are not happy or
healthy and in tune with things on a higher longterm plane- as we see it.

A person who has any or all of these things is truly rich. Otherwise either
perceived as half-full or half empty all you have is a glass -potentially to be
broken that needs to be washed and put away...
