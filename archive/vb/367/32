he still doesn't list a name i can tell the flap monkey; gonna have 
to find a REAL parts store somewhere.

btw, anyone have the length of 6mm stud i would need to replace a 
sump stud in the crapcase? one keeps coming unscrewed every oil 
change, even w/ loctite green.  i intend to double nut it, so need a 
longer than normal one....
