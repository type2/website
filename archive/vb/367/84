Craig,

If you can get the bolt inside the lip of the oil hole, you could just
install it and run the head down tight against the case. Don't forget to
coat the threads with a good sealer before installing.

You could cut off the head and install from the outside and reach a nut up
inside and tighten it down. Of course, you could just can the stud idea and
install the bolt from the outside to hold the cover in place. 5 nuts and a
bolt.

Good luck,
Chris
