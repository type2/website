The part number seems to be 03.9902-0501.2 .  Lots of sites in Germany
have it for aroud EUR10-EUR11 but none of them want to talk about
shipping costs.

It also seems to be an OEM specified part for at least Porsche and
Mercedes - you might try a dealer.  There will be a substantial extra
charge for the logo.  The offical VW part number from the 1967 catalog
is "B 1" for a 180 g tube - for a laugh, ask a VW dealer.

I found one reference saying Girling makes a similar paste.

There is a place here in town that does brakes and clutches for vehicles
and industrial equipment.  They are a Bendix dealer, but they'll work on
lots of stuff.  Someplace like that might be a good place to check.

In searching, it also seems like some people use "brake paste" to mean
the stuff you squirt on the back of disc brake pads to stop them
squealing.  This is most definitely _not_ what you want to put inside
the hydraulic system.
