Subject: danke dreike!

mr. dreike was kind enough to send me a grade 8 6mm bolt - thanks!  i 
had a question on approach here: should i cut off the head of the 
bolt, and use it as a long stud and double-nut inside the case? or 
use the head as is?

btw, i DID find another 6mm bolt at a napa ... grade 5 at best, said 
the drone... and the red 'plating' on it came off on my hand!
