Not sure if this would hold up to temps or not...but have you tried teflon
tape? You know-the stuff plumbers use on fittings, to ensure water
tightness.

I think if you put a couple wraps on the stud before inserting-it should
take up the 'looseness'.

I learned this trick from the list-but I use it for my cargo door handle.
The screw kept loosening up while driving around. So I wrapped the screw in
Teflon tape-and it seems to have solved the problem.
