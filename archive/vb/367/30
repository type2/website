Subject: Re: [T2] Marguee license plate from??

I'm not sure, what that was.  Let me try again:

I saw a licenses plate frame at a VW Show that had a programable marguee in
it (the frame),  Owner didn't want to share where it found it. Wondering if
anyone else had seen these before.  First time I had seen it on a Bus.
