Yes,  but you did not "PAY" $100,000 for it and it is
not worth anywhere close to $100,000.  Maybe $15K now
for nice restored common `50 bug, and REALLY it was
worth even FAR less then that from
`66-`86...seriously.  Splits were nothing in
60s-`70s...even in `80s I recall decent splits for a
few thou max...
