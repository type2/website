Subject: Axle boots

Hi Volks,

Tonight tried my first ever change of axle boots on a swing axle.
Could not get the clamp to close enough to secure it.

Any tricks to this, or does it take a special tool?

Thought maybe some armor all would wet things up to let it slip better
to take up slack. If no other ideas I will just go to hose clamps.

Thanks,

John
