Subject: loose #2 rocker arm

Hey guys,

I was just giving my bus a little tune up(ie check valves, adjust points...)
I had just rotated the engine to #2, and noticed that the rocker arm for the
exhaust valve on #2(the one to the rear of the engine) was extremely loose.
I could easily slide it back and forth on the rod that the rocker arm
rotates on. I compared it to the other rocker arms, while adjusting them,
and it appears as though there is supposed to be a spring washer between the
rocker arm and that spring clip...or something like that. Anyway it is way
loose. When I went to check number 3 and 4 number two was then pretty tight.

I can't figure how I could have missed this before, but I also can't imagine
what would have happened to that spring washer...

Is this a simple fix where I pull the spring clip, put a spring washer in,
re-adjust the valves and call it a day...do I need to call the engine
builder(I got this engine from 'Boston Bob' maybe two years ago(I'd have to
check my records).

Thanks for any suggestions...hope you are all enjoying your weekends...
