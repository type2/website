which was the reason i was looking for other options; gasgacinch 
would leave big chunks of hardened goo/cardboard mix welded to the 
screen and case, requiring scraping.  3H wouldn't completely come off 
without lots of elbow grease. i don't use rtv on anything but the 
base of cylinders sometimes.  decided to try the silicone gaskets, 
since they kill 2 birds with one stone (no more sealants OR gaskets 
to buy). IF they work :)
