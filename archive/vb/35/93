Subject: Long time resting bus

Lonnie, I too am starting a long time rested bus, 1967 deluxe. Last time it
ran on the road was 1974. I got it to my house last weekend (thanks to all
who helped with ideas for tires and trailer ideas, it went flawless due to
your suggestions), and am still just cleaning the inside. I am about to
start with brakes (none), undercarriage (surface rust only), and engine
(original), and whatever else comes along just to get it up and road worthy.
My question to you and other listees, what would you think/suggest that I
start/concentrate on? This is a bus that has rested for 27 years in the high
(4200 ft.) desert. I have not seen any ratnests, nor any other signs of
varmits that had homes in the bus.
TIA, I am ready to start this new adventure of VW life (1st vw).
