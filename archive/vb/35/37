Disconnect the battery negative strap.  Hook up an ammeter with the
+ lead to the strap and the - lead to the body.  It'll probably read
a few milliamps - this is the drain on your battery.  Go up front and
remove fuses one at a time until the ammeter shows zero drain.  If
you can't get it to zero drain by pulling fuses, then disconnect the
unfused circuts (like the ignition coil) one at a time.  You'll find
it eventually.  Don't forget wiring diagrams online at
