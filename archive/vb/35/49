pretty much all over the country: I spent $405 to get front and rear blades,
all the overriders, etc, straightened.
    This included patching in the rear blade where it had been cut for a
trailer hitch by a PO, removing all the bondo on the front bumper and
straightening all by pounding out, cutting in, grinding the welds, and
replacing pieces, etc. so that the bumpers looked brand new and could have
been clear coated.
     It took several months and numerous visits to the bumper guy to get
them right, but once that was done, I got them powder coated with traffic
signal white which I supplied the powder for(ordered a 55# box shipped in
for future use and volume discount on the powder).
     All told, I had 4  bus rims, 4 bumper brackets, 1 emblem, and 9 pieces
of the bumpers/overriders sandblasted and powdercoated over a zinc primer
for $205. Of this total the rims were $120 so the other 14 pieces cost $85,
and that included black on the brackets and backs of the rims, which didn't
work out well because of the inherent overspray which collects on the other
side because of the electrical charge used in powdercoating.  The painter
told me this would happen but I tried it anyway, and the backs are mainly
black with about a 25% white overspray. Live and learn.
    In any event, the powdercoating,sandblasting, straightening, etc. look
great and hopefully will last a long time.  However, you can't powder coat
over bondo, so the most important part of the whole process is the
straightening of the bumpers without bondo!!
    The more pieces you have powdercoated, the less each piece costs to do,
so engine tin, splash guards, your spouse's lunch box etc. are all fair game
if you like.
