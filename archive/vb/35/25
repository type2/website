Subject: Middle seat for sale

I have a 2/3 1/3 middle seat I am willing to sell/trade to some one. It has
original material on it but in places it has been re-stitched by hand. This
is a very nice seat for a 62 to 66 bus. I will sell it or trade it for ???
Pictures available if seriously interested. If no interest I'll whore it out
on e-barf.
Rack, tent, westy tow hitch are items I would like to trade it for, either
up or down in price.
