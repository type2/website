 Or you can do like I did to the Pritschenwagen....go to WAL-MART, buy the camouflage spray paint specifically for hunting vehicles (Krylon, me thinks) and have at it.  While you are there dont forget to pick up the obligatory gun rack, a CB radio and some chaw.   Hehehe

Sherwin Williams makes many common brands - like Krylon.

They have an online store.



Did you know you can buy PPG paint online as well?
