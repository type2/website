Back in the old days when computers had an LED display on the front
proudly showing the CPU frequency, I figured out that the display was
simply hardwired to display a single number.  My middle of the road 33MHz
computer suddently became a 99MHz screamer!  :) >

I was perusing one of the Riceboy groups a while back and a fellow there
was bemoaning the lack of performance Honda cars.  He had a little chart
of power to weight ratios, with 16 lb/HP being good and 20 lb/HP being
bad.  A little math reveals that my bus is, roughly:

3000lb/50HP=60lb/HP
