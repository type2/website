I hate to keep referring back to my "builder" (I am not equipped with the
tools or skills to build an engine yet), but he says that the new cases are
"soft" and that an old german case will deliver 10 more horses than any Mex
or Brazilian.

I am willing and able to buy a new case, but the quest, right or wrong, is
to find a good AJ. That is why I put it to this group. Is my builder
correct? Full of it?
