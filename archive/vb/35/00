Subject: upcoming OCTO show q

I need a few good used parts for the bus, mostly mechanical stuff like
old vacuum dizzies and carbs and little parts. Will the OCTO show next
weekend have a swap selling this kind of stuff? I'm new to the bus
thing, haven't been to an OCTO show, and I'd like to know before I
drive the 400 miles to LA...
Any campouts before the show?
Thanks and I hope everyone has a great weekend,
Joel and the 64 Sundial
(Wanted to go to WA show this weekend but couldn't...)
