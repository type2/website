Subject: Clutch return spring/clutch lever questions..... C clamp size for redux mounting?

I just installed my new trans. The problem appears to be that the clutch
lever return spring doesn't return the pedal. Effort to depress pedal is
very low, and appears to move easily. Bowden tube seems right. I figure I
need to replace the spring, since my old trans had a good snap to it, and
this doens't have much. Of course the old trans lever came right off, but
this one won't. I am soaking with oil now, but has anyone made a puller, or
know a trick to get that off with trans in situ? I assume this must need
suffcient pressure, or the throw out will remain against the clutch and
prematurely wear? The clutch itslef cannot be the return mechanism, or what
is the point of this spring? Is this a common problem?
I am assuming my rebuilder scored a case and didn't mess with the lever...

Also, the lever on the trans is curved inward toward the trans, and the
other lever I have is straight, which one is correct for a 66 bus?

Will a 10" c clamp be a suffceint size to squeeze the spring plates to the
redux boxes with the brakes on? I don't want to mess up any more redux box
bolt holes.
