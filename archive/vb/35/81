I've been trying to locate the source of a tranny leak in my '58 SC (orig=
inal
split case tranny).  One spot seems to be at the rear most drain plug. 
Are the tranny drain plugs supposed to have a washer like the oil drain
plugs?  Mine do not.  Also when the plug is sufficiently tight, it seems
like there is still a small gap between the head of the plug and the tran=
ny
case...like a gap where a washer would fit perfectly.  Maybe I'm not tigh=
tening
it enough... is there a torque specification for the tranny plug?

No washer, the drain plugs go into a hole that gets narrower as it goes
inward.  So if you overtighten it, you could crack the tranny case.

My '55 original tranny drain plugs have a much bigger gap than the one yo=
u
mention.

One alternative is to use some teflon tape on the threads, I had to do th=

on one of my reduction box drain plugs.
