Subject: Stupid bumper question

Hi list-

I am about to have a couple of bumpers powdercoated, but before I do 
I want to make sure I have the correct ones.  Looking at my two 67 
busses, I noticed a nice mix of pointy and slash bumpers.

I think that the 67 is supposed to have slash.  Correct?

Thanks
