Subject: Puyallup Score

We went to the Puyallup show yesterday. It was a good show with a nice
selection of parts for sale. We waited in line for 15 minutes to get in, but
once in we found some of the treasures I was looking for. Someone within the
first few minutes of the door opening made the real score though. Seems this
French gentleman with a booth had some toe hitches for sale. When I asked
him if he had one for a split bus he told me he sold his only one to the
first one that made it to his booth. I described a westy hitch to him and he
said that is what it looked like. Then when asking him how much he sold it
for he said $40.00 :-{
Any chance it was a fellow listee?
