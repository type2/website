Subject: RE: [VB] LEAKING TRANNY

>No washer, the drain plugs go into a hole that gets narrower as it goes
inward. So if you over tighten it, you could crack the tranny case. 

Also it is a good practice to clean the threads out very well before
reinstalling the plugs.  

For some reason my tranny plugs all were covered in schmigma that was hard
as a rock to get out of the threads.  I used a table mounted 5" wire wheel
to clean the threads out, very nice tool to have.  The plugs came out
looking brand new!...  Well except that one the PO decided to remove with
vise-grips :(  luckily still usable though.   

Also I learned that the Brazilian swing axle boot kits contain o-clamps that
are worthless!  Under the stresses of use they pull apart and break, leaving
your tranny fluid to leak out of the boot.  I went back to my packrat shelf
and put on the original German 30some year old ones back on, which still
work perfectly.

I agree with Everett, try the Teflon tape.  It is very inexpensive at Home
Depot (less than a $1), but not at the FLAPS.


Good luck,
