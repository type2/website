First you can either put a .82 4th from the stock 89 depending on the year
of the trans. A 3.88 ring and pinion is the norm, which also intales
changing the 3rd/4th gear shaft. It's not just a r/p swap but a lot of
internal work also. Just buy one done, don't do this at home.

Exactly what mods are done when rebuilding a transmission to be a "freeway 
flyer"?
