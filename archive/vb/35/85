Sounds like I'll have to dig out my factory VW tool book for you guys. This
book has every tool listed for VW's with pics of them all.

       I suprized to hear no mention of the other wonderful spring plate 
tools. (brb head'n for the shop).  Bummer mine is numberless, does have a 
bunch of German writing on it.  I've scored the factory fluid level 
protractor a few years back.  It makes setting up spring plates a breeze,
oh, 
great for checking camber too.   As for the spring plate jack, I made my
own. 
 All I can do is laugh when I remember my first spring plate job, floor
jack, 
chain, level, protractor with string and a rock....you get the idea.

                                                                  F.W.Tyler

VW's to list
