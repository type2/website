It's not real important, but which one?  It's important to realize that
there is more than one main bearing.

Probably because of the "AS21" magnesium/aluminum alloy, instead of
the "AS41" that earlier cases were made out of.  Per the "High
Performance" chapter in later Idiot manuals, AS21 is supposed
to take more heat and stay in shape longer.  AS21 started in '75 and
the AJ cases also started in '75, which is probably why "AJ == Good"
in your builder's mind.  Also, being a late-model case, it would
have all the little improvements that VW made over the years.

The engine numbers chart in the Idiot manual implies that "only"
about 140,000 AJ-code cases were made.  Compare this to around
940,000 1300 cases and over 3 million 36 hp cases to get an
idea of what you're looking for.

I would suggest that you obtain a copy of the Idiot manual ("How
To Keep Your Volkswagen Alive", by John Muir) and the Wilson book
("How To Rebuild Your Volkswagen Air-Cooled Engine" by Tom Tom Wilson).
You may also want a copy of "How To Hotrod Volkswagen Engines" by Bill
Fisher.  Those three are the "standard" VW rebuilding and hop-up
references.  Pay special attention to the "high performance" chapter
in the Idiot manual.  Even if you don't plan to do the building
yourself, reading these books will help you figure out what you want
and intelligently discuss it with the builder.

Later you say...

I think I understand what he's saying, but a case by itself cannot
give you horsepower.  Probably what he means is that an AJ case
will flex less and lead to fewer places where frictional losses
can happen.

I would humbly suggest an alternative of going to a Type IV engine.
With the AJ case, you are taking a 1584 cc engine to 1907 cc, a
20% increase.  This is doable, but it will require more work and
money to make it run cool and run right.  Starting with a 1679
(Type IV, 1700 nominal) and going to a 1907 is a 14% increase;
a nominal 1800 (1795) is a 6.2% increase.  It will require less
work to make these larger displacements happy on a Type IV case,
and the Type IV case is stronger to begin with.

Having said that, the place to look for AJ cases is in fuel-injected
Beetles from '75 to '79. 

Good luck!
