Hi Michael and all,

VW tool # 183 is a:

 "C" wrench for round nut. To be used on the nut of the double tapered
roller bearing - automatic stick shift Transmission. It is shown in use i=
n
the 1969ish VW factory Workshop Manual "H" for "Rear Axle and
Transmission", H 4.1 - 5.4

If you have a few other numbers, I may already know them or have them and=

might be able to help you identify them.  Don't bury me though, feed me a=

few at a time.

Us VW Factory tool fetish guys gotta stick together...
