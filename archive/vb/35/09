Subject: #4 Bearing orientation?

Put the gears on the CW crank this afternoon ala the oil on the camp
stove method....boy that snap ring is hard to put on and not scratch the
#4 journal.

I assume the #4 bearing goes on the crank only one way.  Which way????
The Wilson book talks about everything but.  Also how does the oil
slinger stay on the crank?  Concave side toward the pully...right?

Thanks!

Steve
