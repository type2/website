Subject: Clamp for Red. Box and spring plate...

Hi all,

Man, I just LOVE vintage VW tools!  I've been collecting lots of actual V=
W
Factory special tools for quite some time now.  I've been able to aquire =
an
extensive collection of these very speciallized VW factory and dealership=

service tools as seen in the Bentley Workshop manuals.  Having the "exact=
"
tool for a specific job really makes vintage maintinence a breeze!

So I noticed recently that someone asked if a 10" clamp would do the tric=
k
to clamp a Transporter spring plate tightly to the reduction box to help
avoiding the stripping of reduction box bolt threads.  If you aren't sure=

what we're talking about here, staop and get out your copy of the early B=
us
Bentley Workshop Manual (you do have one, DON'T YOU?) and turn to the
tranny section.  In my 1959 VW Transporter Workshop Manual, in the chapte=
r
"Rear Axle and Transmission" (section "H") in section H-2, page 1 you'll
see the correct clamp for this particular job.  There are several great
photos of a mechanic installing a very large "bar clamp" to squeeze the
spring plate tightly to the backside of the reduction box.  This prevents=

the twisted spring plate from assisting you to cross-thread those four bi=
g
12mm bolts.  I believe that these photos are also in the same area of the=

widely available Bentley reprint of the early '60's thru 1967 VW Workshop=

Manual.

Check out those photos closely, and then cruise on over to your local Sea=
rs
Craftsman tool Dept.  Unless they are temporarily out, right there on the=

rack in the Sears clamp section is almost the same tool!  Even better, it=
's
a quality clamp made in Germany by "Bessey".  The one I bought has a 12"
grip range and a 5 1/2" depth range.  The Sears number off my sales recei=
pt
is #9 31637.  The Bessey sticker on the orange wood screw handle says =

TG5.512  (probably a Bessey part number) and on the metal slide bar it sa=
ys
among other things "maximum pressure 1320 lbs at 6 inches".  I bought thi=
s
in April 2001 and it cost $25.99.  It even has non-marring hard rubber
covers on the feet.  While I haven't had the opportunity or need to use a=
nd
test it as of yet, I took grip and depth measurements of my reduction
box/spring plate assembly as seen in those photos, and the 12" x 5 1/2"
clamp described above should do the trick nicely!  I'm not sure that a 10=
"
clamp will be wide enough.

Well, I just thought a few of you might enjoy my discovery, so that you t=
oo
can add yet another newly made, but Vintage VW style tool to your bag of
mechanical tricks.  =


Good luck and happy wrenching!
