Subject: Sevierville_oct_01 and VW postcard

Jan & I made our fourth October trip back to Tennessee and after doing the 
antique thing we went to the Round Yer Wagons at Sevierville. Unfortunately 
it had rained the night before but it was great to see another VW show beside 
the shows on the West Coast.
I also found a neat postcard from a NY hotel with a picture of a 63? 23 
window bus and a bug.
