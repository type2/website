Subject: Thread pitch of redux box bolts.

Bad day in progress....I guess I was due for one. Crosss threaded a redux
box bolt hole. Need to confirm that it is a M12 1.5 25mm deep. I figure it's
that or 1.25, need to confirm to order the chase and bottoming taps.
Any one have a source for the studs in the redux boxes to hold the brake
backing plate on? I could use two as well.
