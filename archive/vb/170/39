Subject: Re: [VB] input shaft play q

The front of the tranny does not have a bushing to keep the input shaft 
from moving sideways. It relies on the bearing in the gland nut for 
this. The c-clip is just for holding the reverse gear in place. The 
internal and external input shafts are actually held together by a 
small stud. The exterior input shaft is screwed onto the interior input 
shaft and then the splined reverse gear is slid over that mating 
section. The c-clip is the applied to hold the splined reverse gear in 
place.
