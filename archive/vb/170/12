A phone call will always work better then an e-mail to them. I have had
numerous customers get stuff from them on a regular basis. I always tell
them to call and order and they have there stuff within 10 days.

I ordered a set of jailbars for the back rear seat three weeks ago 
and haven't heard a peep. I've emailed them twice, once last week and 
the week before asking if they got my order and my credit card 
payment, but I get nothing - silence.

Anyone know if they are out of business or is this SOP for them?
TIA,
