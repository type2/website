Type 1 and 2 engines have the number stamped on the vertical surface
just below the generator flange.  Type 3 engines have it stamped on
the horizontal surface just to the left of the generator flange, between
the flange and the case centerline.  Page 32, top right, of Wilson's
book has a picture.

Page 47 of Wilson doesn't list these.  There is a 311 101 375 dual-port
for Type 3 1600 starting in '67, and a 113 101 375 A dual-port for Type
1 1600 '71-'74.

Have you looked on the vertical surfaces on either side of the oil sump?
Usually there will be a VW logo and a part number cast in there.
