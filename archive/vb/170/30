Subject: input shaft play q

Is there some play here, assuming we have just a c clip holding it in? I
know mine isn't bent and clip is not broken. I checked/spun it a couple
times yesterday, seems fine, just wiggle slightly, though I remebred this on
the old trans and this one after rebuild, just confirming. No sign of any
seepages.

I have some movement in and out, not much, and very little inside to side/up
down deflection.
