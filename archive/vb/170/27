Look especially hard at the grounds at your rear tail lights.  Originally
they just grounded through the reflectors touching the body sheet metal -
they don't have separate ground wires.  Add ground wires from each
reflector to where the battery negative strap bolts to the body and you
will probably be amazed at how much brighter your rear lights are.
