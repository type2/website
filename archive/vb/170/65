Subject: Matt Roberds 9-pin

Well,
after going a month without turn signals I finally got back into my Matt
Roberds special. Sure enough, the rain water from last winter/spring had
rusted up two relays. I replaced them and made sure water couldn't get to
them again. Nifty little circuit for sure. Thanks again Matt.
