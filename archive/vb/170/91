the bit that sticks out- there are two sizes- one its the 3/4 ton brake drum 
(through 63), one fits the 1 ton (bigger) brake drum. (both 63 1 ton and 
64-67)

takes different axle nuts and bearings.

the link pins- there is the small size and the bigger size.  50-63 is 
smaller.   63 1 ton is same as 63& earlier.. 

The link pin size has to fit the size of the hole in the trailing arms.
