Subject: Oil sucking into carb from cleaner.

I noticed my carb had some oil on the top of it from my oil batch air
cleaner. I have always experienced some oozing from the oil filler breather
hose into the cleaner. What causes this? I imagine the oil is getting
atomized and sucked thorugh the filter into the carb?
