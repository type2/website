Subject: Safari's in a Westy

Planning on installing a set of safari's in my 67 westy. Was wondering if
the child's cot can still be used if the safari's are closed? Will the
safari's mounting brackets and sliders be in the way of the cots front
pole?Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance...
