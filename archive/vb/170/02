I saw a few replies to this but no one said:
STOP!  Don't put a 12v starter in!

Unless you pull your engine and replace the flywheel with a 12V flywheel, you
HAVE to use a 6V starter. The ring gear teeth are a different count and
diameter. The starter drives are completely different between 6 and 12V. Get
another 6V starter and put a 12V solenoid on it.
Besides the flywheel size you would also need to put in a special bushing in
the bellhousing. The diameter of the shaft is smaller on 12V. If you did
replace the flywheel and did not want to replace the bushing, you could use
the auto trans self-supported starter....
