Subject: Where can I find a 7 wire US indicator lever/switch ?

I am looking for a US spec 7 wire indicator (turn signal) lever/switch for an
imported Californian bus with hazards here in England.
I understand the European buses have a different 4 wire switch, so can someone
stateside let me know where I can get one of these - ideally from somewhere who
can take a credit card/paypal and send it USPS airmail to me in England.
I really need to get this in a week or two, so any help gratefully received!

Thanks
James.
