Subject: 1960 electrical issues

Hi,

I have a 1960 Kombi and have a couple of electrical issues.  When the brake 
pedal is pushed, the turn    signal indicator light and the generator light 
glow dimly.  When the brake is let off, the lights go out.  The second 
involves the turn signals.  When the left of right rear signal is on, and the 
brake pressed, the opposite light flashes dimly.  I have begun cleaning all 
of the connections and grounds etc, but thought someone with a similar 
experience would be able to help me to locate the solution directly.  

Thanks!!
