Subject: Nose skin neede for a '60 in IL

I'm not in a hurry...it's not like I need it today. The Bus is in fine condition overall but
eventually I'd like to replace "bondo nose". Driver door would be nice too. If anyone knows of any
donors in the Chitown area I would appreciate a little note.

Thank you.
