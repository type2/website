Subject: Bumper brackets

Last Saturday in the UK we had the annual Split Screen Van Club London to
Brighton Run.  There were 950 VWs taking part!  Unfortunately one of my
friends rear ended me near to the end of the run, bending my bumper and the
brackets.
The bumper I think I can straighten easily, but am not sure whether the
brackets are bent and if they are what shape they should be.  Does anyone
have any diagrams or pictures of the shape that the brackets should be?
The frame where the brackets mount is slightly damaged - but this damage
does not look recent however I will straighten it whilst doing it.
He actually did me a favor though - both my bumpers need painting and he is
a car painter by trade so he can now do it for me!

Thanks
Paul
