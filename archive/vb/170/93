Subject: Re: [VB] Safari's in a Westy

My 65 westy had factory safaris and no childs cot or brackets for cot.  I 
didn;t want safaris in teh rainy weather here, so they're gone.

<< 
 Planning on installing a set of safari's in my 67 westy. Was wondering if
 the child's cot can still be used if the safari's are closed? Will the
 safari's mounting brackets and sliders be in the way of the cots front
 pole?Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance...
