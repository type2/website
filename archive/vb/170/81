Subject: re: [VB] Safari's in a Westy- no sweat...

No problemas, Senor!. Stock Safaris will work fine in a 67 Westy.
Yes, I did prefer to use a screwdriver to loosen one of the screws and remove
the other while slipping the front cot pole into place. I finally figured out a
routine wherein the rear most (aft) cot pole was  postioned, then the passenger
side of the front pole. Lastly slipping the drivers' side of the same front
pole in behind the loosened bracket. Retighten the screws and you are ready to
go. It's either that or scratch the F out of your paint job. Trust me on
that...
There is no interference in the basic opening/closing of the safaris.
