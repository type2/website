Since I'm running a crew cab and I can easily reach up and flick on the
overhead light, I decided to use the speedo pod mounted switch for my
back up/warning (I routinely use them to flash drivers racing up on me
in the slow lane at night) lights.  I mounted two of the aforementioned
bug reverse lights under the rear bumper.  Looks almost "factory". 
Works great at waking up tailgaters too!

The bad is that I often forget they are on :-|
