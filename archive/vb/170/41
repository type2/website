Hi Paul,
We have heard it is not a good idea to use a O-ring type FW with a non-O-ring 
crank.  Do check which type of paper or metal gasket (Yes you have to have 
one or the other in there!) you are using and look for scratches in the 
surfaces on either side of this.  Also reshim your endplay and polish the 
bore the FW seal seats into with 300 or 400 grit wet/dry.  Just this latter 
step helped to rid us of a nasty oil leak that had bothered us for over 4,000 
miles and three FW seal replacements!
