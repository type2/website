Subject: Re: [VB] 40hp heads

I still have a pair of rebuilt OG # 373 40 H heads.
These are cc'd, powdercoated black, and ported
exhaust for stock or mild cam application.
New guides, springs, shims, seals, and valves
( stainless optional) .These parts alone cost more than jdd
paid for new heads. I have the case powdercoated as well.
Does anybody know the horsepower output of a 40 H engine ? :)
( I am thinking of using it as a starter for a  911 conversion engine :)
