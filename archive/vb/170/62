Subject: Re: [VB] input shaft play q

If that stud does break, the input shaft will pull straight out of the 
tranny with a slight slowdown at the c-clip. I have not had any 
problems with that stud. It does seem like a flimsy design though. I 
read somewhere that VW beefed up the design in later versions of the 
tranny. However, I have not seen one.

When I assemble my tranny I noticed that the input shafts do not 
tighten fully on the stud and allow the splined reverse gear to slide 
on properly. It may be 1/2 spline loose before it will slide on.
