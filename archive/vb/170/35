I installed the 67 bug type back up light on my 61 15 window and my 65 westy. 
They both have 67 nose cones with back up switches.  On one it is attached 
with a strap around the left rear bumper tube, the other I modified the stock 
bug holder so it bolts to the bus' bumper.   Ran a wire from the 15 side of 
the coil to an in-line fuse then to the reverse light switch on the  nose 
cone, then back into the engine compartment, to the left and out to the light 
on the bnumper.   Light is grounded to the bumper, which is grounded to the 
bus.  I used the stock VW connectors that you push the ends into, for easy 
disconnect.   People started being real polite about letting me back up in 
parking lots, cause the light told them I was doing that. 

You can also get switches that go to the speedo- stock VW ones that make the 
switch go on when the left front tire rotates backwards.   I see them at 
shows for about $25 a pop.   If you use a toggle switch I'd think it might be 
good to use one that lights up so you dont accidently leave it on.

<< Since I have the starter and carb out....   Being that my bus is a 66 and 
 has no backup lights, I picked up a backup light for a 67 bug at the 
 swapmeet this weekend for 2 bucks.  It's one of those hella ones that attach 
 to the bumper.  I have seen other busses with this type of light on them.  
 Would this be the correct light to use or is there an aftermarket one?  If 
 anyone else has done this, would I wire according to the 67 diagram?  I had 
 thought just running a switch up front would be sufficient.
