Hi Volkvan12,
First buy a $15.00 volt/ohm meter from a hardware store and use this to check 
for any voltage drop through out the entire wiring system.  Write down where 
you find loss of voltage for future replacement, cleaning, fixing.  Install a 
grounding wire system from each taillight and directly to the battery ground 
strap.  Then check out the type2 library for rebuilding your headlight switch 
and soldering all the rivet connections inside and out of it.  Also remove 
the fuse box and solder the rivets on the front of it.  Above all when you do 
take apart the wiring system to work on it, disconnect the ground strap from 
the battery first.  There are many wires that are not fused throughout the VW 
and you can burn it up in a flash if one wire grounds out!
