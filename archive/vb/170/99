Subject: Re: [VB] input shaft play q

I have seen the stud break and the shaft slide out when the bearings in the 
tranny are shot.  Really bad.
then again, maybe you have one that just snapped.  I friend of mine drove 
around for years in a bug that the shaft would come out of when he pulled the 
motor.  At least a clutch alignment tool was handy!!!!

 normally there should be no strain on the stud.  so no reason to left it 
extra loose AFAIK. normally you don't torque it, but tighten it then back it 
up to so the splines of the collar fit.  Then the collar takes the twist.
