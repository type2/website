Are 6V and 12V flywheels interchangeable?  I have a persistant front oil
seal leak and several people have said that they reckon it is due to the
fact that I have a 6V flywheel on a 12V 1600 twin port crank.  They say that
although they go together, they do not fit properly.  Anyone have any
knowledge or experience of this - I have searched the net and have not found
any reference for this.

Thanks
