A Fleetline?  That's what the ZebraBus is.  I asked Christian Figenschou
about that and he said "The Fleetlines have pretty much the same wiring
as a late split, the only diff being the changes for the alternator."

I'd suggest starting with a '66 or '67 split diagram from Thom's site to
see how well it matches what you have.  For the alternator, look at the
wiring diagram for about a '73-up Bug or Bus.  The wire for the warning
light at the speedometer is the same, but the connections in the engine
compartment for the alternator and regulator are different than the
generator ones.

Good luck!
