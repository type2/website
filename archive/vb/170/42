Hi Joel,
Hard to say!  VW was always improving things, but sometime those improvements 
came back to bite them.  Does the 371F or the 373 heads have the long or 
short rocker studs?  You could have a welder put in some fins for you.  There 
was a later 40HP head that had a slightly bigger diameter intake manifold and 
thus the casting in the head was opened up resulting in a little better 
breathing.  Which worked better for the big bore P&Cs.
