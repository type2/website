Subject: RE: [VB] 40hp heads

OUCH! My headache motor has 373A ! I can't imagine the overall smaller
combustion chamber size, after being flycut to fit a 1600!

Ronnie, I will have deckheight and shortblock checked out by Sunday I
hope...Will pmail about parts, going to need good SP heads, if the shorty
looks ok.
AL




Don't confuse the 373A for the 373.  The 373A is the head for 1300 Beetles
(66).
