Its a metalizing treatment like I've seen on aircraft engines in light
aircraft.
My Type IV cases tell point of origin on the lower oil pan sides, I can't
see these because of the add on 2 quart pan.
Heads are dual port, No Doghouse it has remote cooler and filter. It has
a block off plate between the generator/alternator pedestal and the
distributor.

Thanks
Stan

Hmm, did someone paint the case with black "crinkle paint"?  
Alternately, there may be no number at all if the case or engine was
replaced.  My Mexican engines have no numbers.
 
Other cluess:  single/dual port?  Doghouse tin?  dates in heads?  If it's
a late model dual port it is probably a 1600.
