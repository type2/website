Subject: Re: [VB] 6volt Starter Life Span and Carb Problem

It could have helped it along.   To change to 12V starter you will need to 
swap the FW on the motor, as the teeth size has to match the FW.   (Watch for 
stepped cranks. ) Or put a 12V solenoid on a 6V body.

Yes- definately put a drop on the wiper motor.  Then it'll last.

did you swap over all the light bulbs- including the overhead ones?  use 
12V5W or the covers (if there) will get melty.

do you have a 12V choke and element on the carb?

do you need to readjust the choke about yr stalling- is this a warm up issue? 
or happen even after bus is warmed up?

<< Hey all.  My starter just burnt out.  It was a 6 volt starter and I 
recently 
 went to 12 volt w/ alternator.  I am going to put a 12 volt  in for a 
 replacement, but I am worried about the other 6 volt items that may go, 
 wiper motor for one.  Did my 12 volt system fry my 6 volt starter?  It made 
 a really bad noise and I could smell it burning.
 
 I have also been having a problem w/ my 34 pict 3 carb and my 009.  I 
 frequently stall at idle.  Will putting a pop rivet in the butterfly cure 
 that?
