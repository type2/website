Subject: sanding crankshaft pulley/pulling oil pump

was writ:
"Additionally when we install a stocker pulley we custom sand the inside
diameter to a slide fit onto the crank.  This takes a while, but is worth it
if later out on the raod the oil pump nuts need to be tightened!  Sanding is
sped up greatly by rotating the pulley on the sand paper just before
installing the pulley by hand till gets stuck and pull it back off.  With
the previous sand paper marks at a 90 deree out of the direction of the
stuck pulley marks you can easily spot where to sand for the tight spots.
Which you sand by hand going in line with the crankshaft direction."

just for clarification....which grit sand paper do you use? are we talking
like 300 grit? i imagine if it is loose-that is a bad thing, so i want the
pulley center hole enlarged enough so the pulley slides on and off without a
puller, yet small enough that it is a very snug fit.

if i understand your post-you sand in the direction of pulley travel, then
try to put it on, and the marks where it hit will show up as perpendicular
to the pulley. Then you sand wherever it hits.

second question-you suggest loosening the case bolts around the oil pump a
little bit to ease the removal of the pump. is this always required? i admit
i fear screwing around with the case bolts-as everything is working well. if
i loosen-how many turns ae you talking about? like one turn, half a turn,
until the pump slides out? should the pump basically slide out pretty
easily?

one more question...what do you mean seal around the exhaust shel to the
shroud? my fan shroud has a secondary type of black tin that bolts to the
back of it-to cover the oil cooler. there is a foam strip between these two
pieces of fan tin. is that where you mean?

thanks
