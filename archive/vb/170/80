Subject: No Engine ID

I've got a 66 Westy and I'm trying to determine the engine size (or
original size).
I've run into a problem.
The case has a black finish, I'll call it oxide but at any rate the
engine ID located by the generator base is no longer there.
Since this vehicle has had the reduction gears removed and a type 2
tranny and drive axles installed I'm suspecting that it might be a larger
than stock engine.
I've been trying to use Tom Wilsons book to locate other indicators that
he mentions in the remarks section on page 33 of his book.
I have very little experience with type I & 2 engines so I'm pretty well
confused.
Are there any rebuilders that apply this black oxide finish to their
cases?
Any help will be appreciated.
