Ronnie is correct on the "P" part.  This should help burn hotter at low RPM 
and cooler at high RPM.  Again this is an experiment.

NOPI was the only local place to carry them in Atlanta that I could find.  
This is not a plug for NOPI either.

The current wires I am using are the NGK blues.  I am fairly certain they 
are resistor/carbon wires.  Either way I think they have burned out.  But 
for a stock application they are pretty nice wires.  Then again for the 
money the Magnecor and Super Mag Plus wires are a better choice in my 
opinion.

Take Care,
Adrian
