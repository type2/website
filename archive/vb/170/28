If you got a '66-down Bus with a backup light from the factory, it would
have been mounted in the body above the left tail light.  For '67 and
up there was another one above the right tail light.  Nothing wrong with
using the Bug light though.

>I had thought just running a switch up front would be sufficient.

The '67 diagram presumes that your transmission has the switch on it,
or that you can get a switch and screw it on to your transmission.
If you don't have that, putting a toggle switch up front is probably
simpler.  Come off the hot-in-run fuse (second to the right) with an
8 amp inline fuse and feed your toggle switch with that.  Then run
a long wire to the back for the light.  16 gauge will work but 14 is
better.

If you want to be really clever, work out some kind of quick-release
mount and longer wire for the light so it can become a general-purpose
engine compartment light or work light.
