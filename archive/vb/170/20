In the picture, the front steel bow is callout number 39, while the three
rear steel bows are callout number 40.  Looking in the parts list, 39
is 225 875 513 "Tensioning hoop, front" and 40 is 225 875 515 "Tensioning
hoop, center and rear".  VW seems to have been very keen on reducing
parts inventory whenever possible, so if they list two part numbers, it
seems likely that the parts are really different.  I don't know what the
exact sizes are but if you have three of one size and one of another,
then the different one should probably go to the front.
