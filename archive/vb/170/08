Hi Kevin,
Kind of depends on the initial fit.  We will use 60 grit to get really badly 
tight places out of the way quickly, but work up to 300 grit as we go.  Make 
sure to clean the pulley center well especially the oil return groove on the 
OD before reinstalling.

Exactly!  The marks will show up as shiny streaks running 90 degrees from you 
last bit of sanding around in the pulley

Basicly you loosen the bolts just enough to relieve the tension off of them.  
The pump will not get loose as in falling out, but half as tight and less 
chance to gall the sealing surface of the engine case around the oil pump.

Yes, that is refered to as an exhaust shell by the late bus & bug parts 
books.
