******************************
The 373 head is a superior head in materials and they fixed all the rocker
stud problems prevalent to the prior 371 series.  You do have to use 193mm
Upper Studs verses the earlier 177mm, so keep that in mind.

The 373 head fit 1965 40hp engines installed in Beetles.  I'm sure the
optional 40hp (65) for the Bus was the same way.

Don't confuse the 373A for the 373.  The 373A is the head for 1300 Beetles
(66).
