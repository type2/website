Subject: Re: [VB] Listees' buses for sale?

Couldn't help but notice that 2 Southwest listees just put their buses up
for sale on the samba(including the owner of the samba).  Do they know
something that the rest of us listees don't know???  Are their areas being
occupied by the gov'mint to practice war games for Saddam??? or possibly
they are selling in order to buy the newbus coming out?  Or they both know
that commercial buses are the only true way to enlightenment?  Or possibly
that I have been sniffing to much POR-15???
