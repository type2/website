Subject: Re: [VB] 6volt Starter Life Span and Carb Problem

I have run a 6V starter on a 12 V system since 1976. No problems at all
except wearing out one starter and a bushing. The + side is that your engine
will start in about 1/2 second. I can barely turn the key and let go quick
enough when I start  my bus. O yeah, and it helps to have a good electronic
ignitiion system.
