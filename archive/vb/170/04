Subject: Panel Sheet metal needed in PNW

Hey guys,

I'm in need of panel sheet metal to fix a butchered panel van. Need from the
belt line to the roof, and from just behind the door to infront of the vents,
also on the pass side from behind the cargo door to infront of the vents. The
bigger it could be cut out the better. Does not have to be out of a panel,
would consider a 13 window, etc. Just would like to have something a little
more correct. Will be at Puyallup oct 13th. Also looking for early panel
doors. Please email me off list if you can help. thanks
Mike
