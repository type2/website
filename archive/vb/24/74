Subject: Euro Tails Again

Hey All,

Never did thank everybody for there replies last time....THANX!!!  The other 
nite I disconected the MC switch and ran 2 wires from it to the right brake 
light.  My euro has one terminal for the top signal light which is easy to 
get to work, and the bottom brake/tail has 2 terminals.  I can use the 
existing wiring to light up both filiments indicating which is tail and 
brake but can make the brake light work with the brake pedal/MC switch.

What oem US spec wires do I continue to use?  I know use one for the signal, 
that leaves the ground to the body and 2 or 3 other wires.  I don't know the 
colors right off hand.  Any leads?  Guess I'm gonna just compare US and Euro 
spec diagrams of Thoms sight.  If anyone can make this easy I'd be very 
grateful.  I'm armed w/ one test light;)

Thanks,

Eric
