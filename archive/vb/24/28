Subject: carb jetting

I need some advice with carb jetting. I have rebuilt my 67 kombi engine ( H
block) to 1641 with all else stock. SP heads with a 30 pict 1 carb. I'm
running exremely rich. Sooty plugs and exhaust, and fuel in the oil. The
carb has a 120 main and 125 z air corection jet. Is it better to lean it
with a smaller main jet or a larger air correction jet? How do you know if
youre too lean? Any help understanding carb jetting and todays fuels would
be greatly appreciated.
John
