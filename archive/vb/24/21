 Hi Real Bus People    OK.....That does it!  Who is
this wonderful person named Claralw(-at-)aol.com  ????  I
have seen the post about how to fix this or that on
the old buses....seems to know just about everything
while I seem to have trouble remembering which way to
turn the gas cap to get it back on.....And now this
person speaks French and German and...MAN !! I am
still working on english...How about some background
to bring a newbie up to date here.....Oh...About the
emails to this list about the WTC and terrorist.We are
real people...I think..and should give our feelings on
this topic SOME air here to a point set by the powers
to be on this list..BUT...I am thinking as soon as
split window buses can type their own emails and start
their own list without us there will be human input to
this list.As I have stated before how sad to check the
inbox and just see that a computer is responding to
questions asked without the human touch
included...does a computer sound good speaking French?
I dont think so...well that's my 2 cents and then
some..
