Subject: RE: [VB] bad manners

I have stayed away from discussion of the terrorist issue, because it is
indeed off-topic.  But I am becoming increasingly alarmed at the misplaced
hatred and even outright racism that is swelling as a result of the attacks,
both on this list and elsewhere.

When faced with acts of great violence, it is easy to allow our overwhelming
sorrow and anger to turn us toward blind hatred. Yes, we certainly must act
to prevent terrorism.  But in our fury and desire for retribution, we must
not direct our individual or collective anger toward wide groups of people
based on ethnic origin, race, or religion, rather than the smaller minority
that is actually responsible. It was racial hatred (against Americans) than
caused this, and responding with racial hatred of our own will only feed an
increasing spiral of violence.  As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, "hate
cannot drive out hate."

We must not let the terrorists cause us to lose our own humanity and
compassion.  For if we do, they have taken from us much more than the lives
of 5000 people.
