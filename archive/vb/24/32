Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome report, more 15window damage, pics (long)

that's a tough one.  <grin>  going to jerome jon and i almost made it there is his 1961 westy.  i got a ride back to cali in sam's "free for a saw" 1970 westy.  (thank you sam!!!)  i think it is ever so nice a bus and would much rather ride in a late model than drive the rental car (non-vw) that was considered.
