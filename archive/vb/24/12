Subject: Splits, Bays and the VW spirt

Here in the midwest, we have the best of both.  We have some of the nicest
VW people anywhere and some of the best looking busses of all ages.  I
would put the quality of our people and busses against anywhere in the
country.  I fact, at many of our campouts, we don't even limit the driven
vehicle to VW's, only to those who enjoy them.

We honor the spirt, not just the metal.
