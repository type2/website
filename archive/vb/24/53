Subject: Re: [VB] bad manners & distributor question

yeah, lets not forget that some of us "hippie types" or peaceniks once
served in the military also.  i, for one, was in the army for five and a
half years, 2 of them spent in the 1st Ranger battalion and about 3 in the
82nd airborne division.  i served my time, so now some other kid can go
fight in another country while i sit here and wait for the enemy to invade
my turf, then ill pick up a gun and fight for our own ground.  we all know
paul has his guns ready, right paul :)  im not gonna protest bombing whoever
is responsible for this, but i feel that people should be able to speak
their mind.  however, this isnt the place to get into stupid email battles
over non-bus topics.  i know ive been guilty of this recently and even now,
but im done with my sarcastic replies in defense of myself and others like
me.  im just going to ignore it all for now because there is too much other
stuff to worry about.  lets all just try to stick together.  as for bus
content, i have the stock distributor for my 65, but the vaccum canister is
shot, i also have a 1300 beetle distributor which appears to be the same
except for the canister.  what difference would this make if i used the
canister from the 1300?  thanks!
josh
