Subject: Re: [VB] Blowing oil

I have the same problem (2110 cc). It's caused by high crankcase pressure
from the large displacement. Besides making sure that the case is well
vented, you will probably have to add a sand-seal pulley kit because the oil
is being forced out past the slinger washer at the pulley end of the crank.
The pulley then throws a fine mist of oil all over everything.

BTDT, still fighting it.
