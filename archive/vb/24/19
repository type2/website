I have used this grind cam in a lot of 1600's, anything to boost up the
power band and HP. VW undercamed there engines on purpose to make them last
longer and it's amazing how a small change in lift and duration makes a VW
engine come alive. A prime example is my wife's 1600 in her 65 B#G. I took
apart a BRAND NEW Mexican factory VW engine, just to change the cam to see
what it would do. More power, better torque and incrediable gas mileage (35
mpg on the hwy at 65/70 mph). CB perforamce makes a cam called a mileage
maker, I don't remember the specs (the ones I use are custom ground from
somewhere else), but I have used them and was impressed with what they do to
the VW engine.
