 Get some white lithium grease and apply it with a brush (the larger cans have them attached to the cap) and apply all over the cable.

I hope you are all hanging in there well. Things must be good for me
(in busland anyhow) because all I can find to bitch about is my
speedometer. Since getting back to CA, where things finally dried out,
it has been all the time squeak squeak squeak like a rusty rat wheel.
I am assuming it is the cable, although I guess it could be the speedo
itself, and I'd like to lube it before it sends me slipping and
sliding those last few steps into madness. Oil? Graphite? WD40?
Something else? I am concerned about gumming things up in there.
Thanks all,
Joel
