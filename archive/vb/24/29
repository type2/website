Subject: Blowing oil

I recently purchased a 1961 camper with an engine that had been rebuilt by
Andy Brown Automotive in Utah.  New engine is 1910 cc w/ dual Weber carbs.
Probably too much power for this van.  An external oil cooler and oil filter
were also added.  Anyway I had the vehicle inspected prior to shipping to
Massachusetts and there were no issues.  After running it a day or two I
noticed oil in the engine compartment, a thin layer everywhere.  I tightened
all connections to the oil cooler etc, but still oil in the compartment
after each use.  Any thoughts out there?  Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks.  Don.
