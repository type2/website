Subject: Re: [VB] bad manners...

hey...

first of all, yes this is getting out of hand. this is bad manners...not jsut straying off the subject of the vintage bus, but also bieng..well, lets jsut say, that wehn i open and email from the VB mailing list, i expect something about bussses...or at least a VW..but i also expect that the language here should be fairly pg.but over the last wekk there have been numerous emails of people talking about going over and killing ever muslim in sight,or some variation of that. please...I dont condone violence, in any way, and, this is also far from the place to tell people of your own personal rascism. i felt theses tragic events as much as anyone, but ranting about killing and violence IS NOT THE ANSWER. i dont expect all of you to understand this veiw, jsut to respect it. please, keep violent and rascist emails of the VB list.
thanks, 
meredith
