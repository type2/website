<<But I am becoming increasingly alarmed at the misplaced
hatred and even outright racism that is swelling as a result of the
attacks,
both on this list and elsewhere.>>

Was this directed at me?? Am I being accised of racism for calling the
terrorists "RAT BASTARDS"? Because if I am being accused of racism do to
that remark you are way way wrong. Those terrorists were, in fact, RAT
BASTARDS. It is the only term I can think of that describes them. And,
for point of fact, my brother in law is of middle eastern decent. He is
a great human being and I fear for him, my sister and their children. So
you see, racism has absolutely nothing to do with it. I am becoming
increasing disallusioned with the way my words are being interpretted by
some on the list. It is as if they are reading into them in a way that
points out their own political views. I suppose that is a common thing
these days, but not something I am used to or comfortable with. No
wonder Bob Hoover no longer visits here.

As for bus content. . . does anyone know a way to keep RAT BASTARDS out
of my bus??
