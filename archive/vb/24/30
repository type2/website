Subject: Re: [VB] Blowing oil

Had the same thing with my 1776cc engine.  Are your valve covers vented?
I'm guessing not.  There is a kit sold (Empi/Bugpack?) with all the
fittings, hoses, puke box, etc. for about $50.  I installed that and it
totally ended my problems.  Drove my Crew cab from FL to CO this last August
and the engine compartment was dusty when I got there.  I'll never build
another engine without one.
