Subject:  Re: [VB] Westy Flip Seat wanted/Questions

Richard,& JP, there is a  reinforcment plate under the ends of the seat,
where the flip sections bolt down , I still have Danny's 62 Flip here if you
wanna come by and ck it out Richard. The seat and all is in it. I had to fab
a replacement plate for those ends when i did the sheet metal work on it.
As far as parts off that bus i do not own it, contact Danny Morganelli
