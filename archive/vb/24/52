1. how old were you when you first got sucked into being a vw maniac?
15

2.what was your first car? what was your first vw? your first bus? (if there 
not all the same)
My first car and first VW was a 66 Bug I bought from this crazy drunk across 
the street for 500 bucks. My first Bus I bought in 97, it was an original 
owner 67 Westfalia poptop, I had to sell it and the kid who bought it 
ultimately destroyed it, someday I'll find him...damn punk.

3.how many RUNNING busses do you have? (dont list all the non-ops, this email 
wiill be HUGE!)
Just the 62 runs, the 54 bucket is light years from moving under its own power

4. do you have a favorite? wich one?
Well I drive the 62 but like the 54 best, its just rustier, uglier and is 
generally awful. Smells funny too. 

5. stock or custom?
Stock appearance, but maybe a stronger engine. How do you slam a 54? :)

6.would you punch an alien?
Is the alien bigger than me?
