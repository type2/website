It sounds like you disconnected *both* wires at the MC switch, which
isn't right.  You have to disconnect one wire and leave the feed wire
hooked up.  To find the feed wire, turn on the key but don't step on
the brakes.  Go under the Bus and try your test light from ground to
each wire in turn.  The one that lights the light is the one that
should stay connected to the switch.  Disconnect the other one and
turn the key off.  Run *one* new wire from the now-open terminal on
the master cylinder switch to the right rear.  Hook that new wire
to the brake (bright) filament, and run a jumper from there over to
the brake filament on the left side.

>What oem US spec wires do I continue to use?

All of them.  The running light wires still go to the running lights.
The brake/turn wires now go only to the turn signals.  The new wire
from the master cylinder switch goes to the brake lights.  Do look
at the wiring diagrams at vintagebus.com - basically each US-spec
tail light has two hot wires plus ground and each Euro-spec tail light
has three hot wires plus ground.

Good luck!
