 friend gave me a 1971 Super Beetle 1600 motor that I will be installing some
 time this weekend. My question is regarding the clutch. The 1500 that came
 out of the DC looks different from the 1600. Do I need to change the throw
 out bearing or anything else on either the motor or the tranny side? Any
 light that can be shed on this will be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks...

the clutch that was on the 71 beetle does not mesh with the throwout bearing 
for the splitty bus.  Swap the clutches over- so the clutch that was in the 
bus stays with the bus.

earlier bugs use the same clutch/throw out bearing as splitty buses.  they 
changed in 1970 I believe.
