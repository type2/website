I'm sorry Ron, it is not hatred. It is not revenge. Who ever supported this act
of cowards must be struck with a blow that is so terrible that their children
will never dream of harming my people again. 

I don't care if they love me; I don't even care if they like me. And I could
care less if the hate me. Just don't F__K with me.

I, WE, have been F__ked with.

Unless you want these RAT BASTARDs (and Lester hit it right on the head)
slitting the throats of more women, they must learn the lesson the Nazi's and
the Emperor did. If you back down as these pepole expect, they will bring this
to your door steps again and again.

ne-mo me im-pu-ne la-ces-sit: no one attacks me with impunity. 

This is the motto of Scotland and the Order of the Thistle. My people are Scot.
Came to this land in 1923. I'm American, but my grandfather's motto works for
me.

I have been on this group for 6 years now. I believe this is my first off topic
posting. Sorry if my words upset anyone. But I feel like others on the list;
these are not easy times for anyone. But I feel like I know a lot of y'all like
family. If we can relay on each other to keep our rides alive, don't you think
we can help hold each other together? Even if it is "off topic"?

May your God watch over you and yours.
