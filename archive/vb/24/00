Not trying to extend a thread, here... but I think you will find that most 
Type II folks will assist a dead bus on the side of the road, unless SAFETY 
is a factor, which may have been the case with the 'fly-by' bay 
windows......  ( I have been broke down on that same stretch...)   I really 
don't think that there is any prejudice when it comes to a bus owner 
helping a fellow owner, just a few bad eggs out there.....

On the way home from Jerome, desperately wanting just a shower and a nap, I 
stopped, to help a busted loaf.... I couldn't get all the way off the road 
to park, ( on Mingus Mtn), but I compromised and stopped long enough to 
scavenge some nuts and bolts from the tool box, for him to bolt his cooling 
fan back on and get down the road.  It never occurred to me what type of 
bus it was....  Many, many of us have gone as far as taking hardware off of 
our own vehicles to get a bus a little further down the road....  ( I 
should replace a few of those missing bolts...!)

So... we may have our preferences when it comes to splitties or loaf's, but 
when it comes to helping someone out, it is the nature of the person, and 
once again, safety, that are the primary factors....
