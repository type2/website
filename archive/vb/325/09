It is important for me to re-state that all trailing arms have been
replaced.  The offset on each side is PERFECT 7mm!  So if the camber is off,
it must be that the frame and beam mounting plates are bent.

According to my level, the left wheel is closer in at top (negative camber)
by .01 degree, and the right is out at top, (positive camber) by .08
degrees.

That is NOT within the +/- 30' stated allowable tolerance!

"if you arranged the shims to spec, that is how the camber is set.  do not
alter the designated shim arrangement, says VW.  If your trailing arms or
parts
are bent, replace."
