Subject: RE: [VB] New Mexi engine with 034 dizzy

I've found over the years the same thing, different dizzy for different
applications. The trike and baja's get .009 and the truck 1641 vacilates
between a 205T and a SVGA, SVGA winning out. My old 71 bug had a 1600
dual point .050/34 PICT-3 and the 72 bug that I did long distance in had
a 1600 .019/34 PICT-3 and 1.25:1 rockers.

Ronnie,
	I've tried just about all of the vacuum advance dizzys in my low
cr
engine on a '67 bus with a 4.12 R&P and the 009 works best at about
12-13 * btdc at idle.  Still, on my high compression dp 1600 '74 Super
Beetle, a single advance dizzy gives great performance!  We need to fit
what works.  This requires time and experimentation!  Gary Gibson
