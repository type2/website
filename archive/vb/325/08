Subject: Re: [VB] (Last one!) Rebuilt Spindles and Center Pin! (Camber

if you arranged the shims to spec, that is how the camber is set.  do not 
alter the designated shim arrangement, says VW.  If your trailing arms or parts 
are bent, replace.  

I once tipped a bus over 61 w/ 61 suspension (icy mountain pass in snowstorm, 
slid on ice), not going very fast, we hit the edge of the road with the 
gravel bump,  and gentley tipped over.. no glass broken.. and it was all sigla.) 
After it was righted (thanks AAA) and spare tire installed it drove with a 
limp... buh- bump... buh bump... buh bump... I know a VW place only 130 miles away, 
so we drove there ( limping  buh- bump,... buh- bump... buh- bump...)   
waited for the Marginal Mechanic to show up, who said there's an early beam out 
back.. take what you want... and in the dry hot desert replaced the trailling 
arms and spindle on one side... not being sure exactly which piece was bent.   
Drove straight afterwards.      except 500 miles later the rear spindle started 
wobbling, but replaced that too.

When  my 61 corner window was hit, it was about directly on the left front 
axle cap.   But amazingly the only steering damage was to the drag link, which 
was bent funny.  and the axle cap was MIA.  must have been the angle

The tricky question, is how to determine if they are bent.   but it may just 
be an alignment issue at this point...
