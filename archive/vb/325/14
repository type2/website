Hi Josh,
Both the 20mm and 21.5mm (we never have seen this latter size) link pins were 
used up to chassi # 1 144 281 (AUG63).  From chassi # 1 144 282 they used the 
22mm diameter link pins.  The 1964 beam used one needle bearing and one 
phenolic bush per trailing arm up until chassi # 215 036 651 (OCT64).
