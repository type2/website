My 63 Dormobile caught fire in Cape Town in 1996 or so. I'd
just had the engine steam cleaned and a blast from the steam
cleaner punctured the acclerator pump diaphragm, causing a
leak which then caught fire. I first noticed the fire after
it had burnt through the fuel lines and the engine cut out.

I was met with a wall of flame in the engine compartment,
and dumped a 1.5kg dry powder extinguisher on it and put out
the fire. Then I watched fresh fuel gushing from the charred
stump of the fuel pipe onto hot metal, psssh, psssh, WOOOOF!
and it was all alight again. I had a second 1kg extinguisher
that I emptied on it and put out fire only to repeat psssh,
pssssh, WOOOF!

Fortunately, from the moment the bus stopped in a quiet
suburban side street I was repeatedly yelling "FIRE! FIRE!
FIRE!!!! at the top of my lungs, so lots of people came out
into the street and we were given two running hosepipes and
a halon extinguisher and put it out for good. A fire engine
arrived about a minute after we put the fire out.

It took a day of replacing wiring and hoses etc and we were
back on the road. The Dormer still bears the scars of that
one.
