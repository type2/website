Subject: re: [VB] Bus fo' Sale --> used to be mine!  Es Bueno Bulli

Bus used to be mine. I bought it out of Payson, AZ. Had OG paint, zero rust and
only a slight grazing in the typical rear corner. I had it resprayed with
single stage Glasurit (matched property) primer-paint system. It was about the
straightest, most original buses that I had ever owned.

I know that Beto has continued to improve on the great mechanical and cosmetic
condition it was at when I sold it to him.

One thing that I can say about that bus is that, at time of sale, the frontend
and steering was like new... but it was original not hashed together with
aftermarket parts. Was and probably remains pleasantly as tight as factory~ or
thereabouts. I put all new rubber in it and paneled the walls with the good
Baltic Birch. Beto completed the interior in fine fashion/craftsmanship.

I wish that I could afford to repurchase this bus- especially this bus, but
funds are tight and focus is on the kids now-a-days.
Good luck and happy driving to the lucky buyer.
