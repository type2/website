Subject: Bus fo' Sale

Howdy bus peeps.....

Well the dayI thought wouldn't come has finally come.  The 63EZ is now up for
sale.  It's listed on thesamba.com, but I am hoping a listee will want this
bus first, I got it from a listee, Krusty VanBondo, and I would love to see it
follow that road.

P-mail me for details....listee discounts in effect....
