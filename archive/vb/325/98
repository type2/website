Subject: Re: [VB]up in smoke - survey

Has anyone here had their VW go up in flames?    I've had a couple fires... one from backfires out the carb, on from bad fuel line on the bug I just got, both times fire was put out almost immidiately by being smothered with rags/ water.  Small wiring repair needed.  both happened a while ago, since then I have learned to tune up the engine better and replace old fuel line  :)  

Perhaps if I/we stood around flailing my arms and panicking, they would have burnt to the ground.  

So I just wondered how many people have had a fire start and put it out, vs. have a fire start and burn the VW to a crisp. What was done in each situation?
