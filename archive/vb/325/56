Hmmm, just getting ready to order WW rockers, jack points, outriggers, etc.
for my 65 Deluxe Westy(?). What about Alan Scofield's products-2-3 times the
cost ((-at-) Bus Depot), but worth it???? I know Kelly makes his up to order, so
looking for something off the shelf. I did compare an inner rocker side by
between WW & Scofield & it appeared they were slightly different depth,
corner radius, etc.

Inquiring minds need to know,
