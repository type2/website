hmmmm,

OK for straightening but once you start rust-repair welding or putting
heat into complexish shapes that aren't 'restrained' you do
end up with some interesting effects possibly more suited to an
art exhibition rather than going back on the bus?

Do you mean cut the corners off the truck, bang, patch, & weld 'em 
back to shape, then re-attach them to the truck? Actually sounds like 
a good idea!!!!
