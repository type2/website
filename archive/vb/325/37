see, this is EXACTLY why i am building an accessory harness, which 
includes wiring for a later H4 upgrade. i have one tentative taker on 
my 'need two other bussers to go in on wire' quest; if i get two 
definites, we 3 would get 33 ft of a 7-wire bundle - 1 8g, 2 10g and 
4 14g - for about $1/ft, delivered. WAAAY cheaper than anything 
except fishing thru a scrapyard.
