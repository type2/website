Volks,

Check your fuel lines today! If they're more than a year old
replace them.

Make sure the brass tube where the fuel line joins your carb
is tight. Make sure you have a grommet where the metal fuel
line goes through the front (FIF) left engine tin.

And it's a good idea to fit a reserve switch or a solenoid
cut-off to your fuel tank.

And always carry a fire extinguisher (or two)!!!
