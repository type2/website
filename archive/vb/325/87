Ronnie,
	I've tried just about all of the vacuum advance dizzys in my low cr 
engine on a '67 bus with a 4.12 R&P and the 009 works best at about 
12-13 * btdc at idle.  Still, on my high compression dp 1600 '74 Super 
Beetle, a single advance dizzy gives great performance!  We need to fit 
what works.  This requires time and experimentation!  Gary Gibson
