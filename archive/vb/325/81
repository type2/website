May I please add to your "carry a fire extinguisher" remark? MAKE SURE IT IS
CHARGED! If it has been sitting for a year, RECHARGE IT!!! They don't do a bit
of good once they lose their charge... ask me how I know? Remember the January
"Burnt Bus" incident? People stopped and helped, but they had no idea they had
to keep their extinguishers recharged so they didn't do much. One lady had had
hers in her car for over 5 years without knowing that. So PLEASE, get one and
keep it charged or you may as well not have one.

Any idea where I can get a fuel cut-off set-up? I think that would have saved
my poor bus, regardless of how it may have started (since we never determined
the definite cause, although it was PROBABLY the brass tube you mentioned).

Volks,

Check your fuel lines today! If they're more than a year old
replace them.

Make sure the brass tube where the fuel line joins your carb
is tight. Make sure you have a grommet where the metal fuel
line goes through the front (FIF) left engine tin.

And it's a good idea to fit a reserve switch or a solenoid
cut-off to your fuel tank.

And always carry a fire extinguisher (or two)!!!
