Subject: RE: [VB] woohoo!

in a way i kinda wanted to see this thing built. i dont get it tho... 
Volkswagen couldnt build this thing for less than $35k?!?! its stupid, i 
dont know where they think their market is going, they build the Phaeton, 
but can build a "competitive" minivan?

who cares, i dont drive water pumin' VW's anymore anyway and wouldnt have 
bought one of these...
