Subject: Ambulance rear door pictures and dry storage

I am fortunate/unfortunate enough to have acquired a new house 30 meters
away form the sea.  This is absolutely great, for all reasons, except
for the poor bus.  Anyone have any pointers on keeping the garage (and
the bus en general) as dry as possible?

Just one more thing:  A friend of mine is looking for pictures of the
rear door (open and closed) of a late split window ambulance. Any
pointers?
