Subject: Re: [VB] Suspension problems or is it tires?

Just got back from the alignment shop and trip shopping...here's the scoop.

I think I found my main problem in left turns!

The right rear wheel is turned out by 13/32".

Here are the readings:

Front:   Left toe: 1/32"  Right Toe:  3/32"  Total toe:  1/8"

Rear:  Left toe:  1/16"  Right toe:  -13/32"  Thrust angle:  0.5 degrees

Caster on front is -2.1 deg left, -2.6 deg right
Camber on front is  0.4 deg left, 0.4 deg right

Any thoughts?  How do I fix the rear toe issue?

Thanks.  I'll be outside putting those other wheels back on to see what
happens since my front toe adjustments with the sticks ended up looking like
13/32" on the computer...and it was adjusted to 1/8" total.
