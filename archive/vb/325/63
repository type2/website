Subject: Re: [VB] Suspension problems or is it tires?

I'm going to look into that right now.  At first, my reaction was that I
didn't have enough time, but I'll consult the Bently and see what I can do.

In the meantime, I'm going back to Redway tomorrow to attempt to return
those bogus tires.  The shop I had my alignment checked at should have some
good Coopers (a brand I've never been dissatisfied with), and they are right
across the street from the crappy tire selling place.  Of course, the crappy
tire place can balance VW wheels, and the Cooper place can't...so I'll lug
them across the street...

I did put them back on to see what they really felt like, and there is a
remarkeable difference!  The 15" wheels I used for the trip to town and back
felt tons better....except that I didn't like the lack of torque.  I've got
a 4:12 R&P, and I don't need higher gearing, so I don't want to be making
the engine work so hard up hills, especially with the ridiculous amount of
food, tools, spare parts, and various sundries that I have packed!

Total guess of our's is the right rear axle tube is bent from some DPO
accident.  We would unbolt the RGB from the swing plate (with the bus on
jack
stands) and see how much or not parallel they are in the front to rear
plane.  If
that does not pan out we would take lots of measurements of the underside of
the
bus to see where things are out of kilter.
