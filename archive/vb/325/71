I had the same problem with my truck. I thought I was being very
carefull in aligning the adjusters top and bottom evenly so that the
shoe surface was square, but when I went to check adjustment the other
day the bottom one seem to be most of the way in on the right. I just
readjusted them.

I noticed a slight pulling to the right when I was braking, so when I
got home, I went to re-check the front brake adjustment.

Wieerd thing is, on the right side, the lower adjuster is almost all the
way in (can't really see a thread), and the upper adjuster is about
1/4"-3/8" out.  Upper one looks normal to me, but the lower one isn't at
all normal...in fact, it's mighty wierd!

The left side is normal looking.
