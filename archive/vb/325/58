If you are only going to have the 34 PICT-3 on a few more weeks I'd just
bump up the volume a little on the small screw and back out the big idle
screw about an 1/8 turn. Should run just fine. The carb I swapped
between my bug motor and the truck with the header exhaust only needed a
little more volume.

 I lucked into a header & bugpak QP at CYR a few weekends ago for $10.
Thought I'd give it a try. Tonite I finally got around to installing it.
It might be a bit rough looking, but man what a fantastic sound. Very
throaty thump-thump.

I assume I'll have to go up in jet sizes, but anyone have any good
pointers. The single 34pict-3 will only be on there a few weeks while
I'm waiting for my duals, so ordering a lot of $8 jets seems counter
productive at this point.
