You know, you two are still the only people I let slide referring to 
them selves in the 3rd person.  I'd even give the Queen of England a 
hard time with the Royal "we" if I ever met her.  Maybe you have a ghost 
writer, if so Steve would like to me him/her and get their take on Eric 
& Barb.  

You guys ROCK!   We are amused :-)
