Any thoughts?  How do I fix the rear toe issue?
Hi Gene,
Total guess of our's is the right rear axle tube is bent from some DPO 
accident.  We would unbolt the RGB from the swing plate (with the bus on jack 
stands) and see how much or not parallel they are in the front to rear plane.  If 
that does not pan out we would take lots of measurements of the underside of the 
bus to see where things are out of kilter.
