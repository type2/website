Subject: (Last one!) Rebuilt Spindles and Center Pin! (Camber Question)

Important question at end!

I am so pleased with myself for going back and doing the job right!  At
least I know that it is the best it can be (without a frame machine!).

The reconditioned torsion arms are on, new shocks (might as well), torsion
arm offset is a perfect 7mm both sides, shims arranged (and triple-checked)
as per Muir, Bentley, and the instructions that came with the spindles.

I drove out the center pin I had jammed into improperly-reamed bushings, and
reamed them all the way.  With my shift linkage out, this was actually
possible!  I renewed the bushings on my shift linkage, and put everything
back together.

I was able to get some grease into the kingpins finally, as well as
everywhere else.  It sure takes a lot to fill up the beam after the torsion
arms have been replaced!

The steering feels nice, smooth, and "normal" now.  I have only driven it
about a quarter mile so far, and everything feels much nicer.  I think I
still detect a "darting" to the left, but it feels really good to the right.
I'll know more later.

I will be taking this bus to the alignment shop on Wednesday.  Hopefully he
will tell me all is good.  However, I have a feeling that he will be telling
me that the camber is off (negative on one wheel, positive on the other)
because of the accident.  I will take all pertinent tools with me.

Here's question:  If I have a measurement, can I adjust camber with the
shims?  How do I fix it otherwise?  Caster is not adjustable, as far as I
know...

Thanks a bunch!
