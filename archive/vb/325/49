Subject: Gene Berg dipstick sensor instructions needed

Hi all,

I have one of thise Gene Berg oil temp sensors - the type which you wire 
into the oil pressure light which flickers the light when the oil 
reaches a certain temp.

I mislaid the instructions and wondered if anyone had the calibration 
details to hand?  something like 1/4 inch off the contact screw in 
boiling water...

thanks in advance.
