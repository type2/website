Wow, I have been following this thread for awhile and it seems like the
princess and the pea syndrome. I didn't think that most people were that
sensitive to a 1/8" adjustment. As far as the rear goes, you only have
up and down adjustment with your swingarm. When I restored the proper
height on my truck I had to make sure I was on a level floor first and
that my frame was level before I adjusted the swingarms.

Just got back from the alignment shop and trip shopping...here's the
scoop.

I think I found my main problem in left turns!

The right rear wheel is turned out by 13/32".

Here are the readings:

Front:   Left toe: 1/32"  Right Toe:  3/32"  Total toe:  1/8"

Rear:  Left toe:  1/16"  Right toe:  -13/32"  Thrust angle:  0.5 degrees

Caster on front is -2.1 deg left, -2.6 deg right
Camber on front is  0.4 deg left, 0.4 deg right

Any thoughts?  How do I fix the rear toe issue?
