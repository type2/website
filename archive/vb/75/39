Subject:  Kombi Globes

Hi Noel,

Ronnie posted this to the vintage bus list.
I'm in Melbourne 8-).  Very hard to find early
6V European globes in Australia now - they are a Bosch
base (BA7? I have it written down somewhere
and could find the Bosch designation if you
really need it).

The same globes were used in very early holdens (FXs)
and often you have more luck trying old stock of
those rather than asking for early VW globes...

It was obviously going to be such a problem
in the future that I converted my 59 to
12V.  12v globes with that base configuration are readily
available from Hella (but at around $40 each!).

regards

RobK

Dear Sir/Madam,

I e-mailed the other day (30th January) regarding headlight globes 
for an old Kombi (Type II - 1957 or 1958, I'm not sure of the exact 
year).

The Globe is an OSRAM Bilux 7324/1 6V 35/35W Exp vkx

I have taken some measurements of the it (below) and perhaps, with 
these, you will be able to find if there are any currently available.

Overall height of globe:  ~2 1/2" (62 mm)

Height of glass: 1 5/8" (40 mm)
Diam of glass: 1 3/8" (35 mm)

Height of metallic base: 7/8" (22 mm)
Diam of metallic base: 3/4" (20 mm)

Two contacts on the base

Two "lugs" (?correct term for these bits that make for the bayonet-fit),
1/2" up from the base, and thus 3/8" down from top of metallic base 
(I thought, incorrectly, from memory that they were offset, but they 
are not).

One lug is 3/16" wide, one is 1/8" wide;
both stick out - horizontally - from the base ~1/8" (2 mm).

I am down to only three of the four beams working now.  If one more 
beam goes on the already-bung globe the Kombi will be off the road 
(because of having only one headlight)!

I await you reply in anticipation, thanks.

Noel Kemp
