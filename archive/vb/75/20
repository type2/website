Do these little brass ends make a difference? And are they "better" than
just terminating the wire with a good solder job? I wrestled with this when
I put in my new harness, but finally gave up when I couldn't find any
locally. Seems like the least amount of material the current has to go
through, the better, but I have absolutely NO electrical background so I'll
just shut up now.
