I hate to be obvious here, but have you tried to put it on? Unless the
highroof is a distance from you, that seems like the quick way to answer
this...

Subject: [VB] Highroof Rear Hatch


Does anyone have a procedure that I can follow to determine whether a
rear
hatch that I have fits a highroof panel van or a standard panel van?
I've
heard there is a difference in the hatch curvature between a highroof
and a
regular bus.

Thanks,

Charles
