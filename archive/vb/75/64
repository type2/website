Subject: RE: [VB] Final verdict on oil hemorrhage

We were all just ribbing you, we knew what you meant, it just gives a little
chance to get someones goat!

I had an odd one on a Brazilian 1500 block that the previous owner said the
shop could never figure out. He had it replaced at 45K and the new engine
ran great. I picked it up from him complete for $250 and It seem to run OK
on the stand, but had excessive oil pressure. I tried about everything and
then tore it down. Nothing was apparent with any of the oil related
componets and the oil galleys and crank and rod oil slots seemed OK. It had
me stumped for awhile untill a friend of mine wanted me to build a full flow
stump jumper for his dune buggy. When I took the block down to drill open
the galleys, the machinist called me up to come down and look at something.
I always have front and rear of the galley drilled and tapped and when he
showed me the galley down #3&4 side I couldn't believe it. There was enough
casting flash and lodged debri to increase any oil pressure. I had him drill
out both galleys and as far as I know today, that's the same engine still
sitting on the back of his dune buggy. Really wierd.

Okay, I knew that I should have researched what I was told before I
posted to the list. I hate to get the terminology wrong. They were
indeed talking about the plungers and the long & short spring being
inverted.

It turns out that I'm not able to pick it up yet, of course. The oil
pressure is still ~90psi and they fear that I might blow another filter
during the normal warm-up period. They are trying to find ways to bring
that down so I don't run into trouble.

Any thoughts? Thinner oil has been suggested, but maybe there are some
other methods? I am not sure of the performance of the oil pump and it
has been suggested that it is a "high-pressure" unit...

i don't think there is any physical way for the long spring to fit in
the
front (short) relief hole, especially with a plunger in there too. i
could
see the short one in the rear hole though, but the long one in the
short?
i'd like to see that.
