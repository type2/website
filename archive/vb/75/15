Subject: pre 60 wire termination... Poll

Well, yesterday I received a wonderful rats nest in the mail from Rich
Barker... a few pieces were usable (the real cool thing was the og horn wire
which I'll keep as a spare) but very few useable ends to snip and restore to
use on the 59 double cab.  Anyway, right after I pulled the harness out from
the box and was looking it over, the guy I work with comes over and points
out in the new DigiKey catalog, all the *correct* little ends I'd ever want
to buy!!!!!!!!  I then called Bob Nodvik at Wiring Works and asked him what
wire sizes were used and he said 18-10 gauge and followed that by saying
that all wires were not terminated with those little brass ends.... sure
sure, I knew that.

So, here are the numbers from DigiKey (manufactured by American Electrical
Inc.)

288-1088-ND which is a 6mm long terminal for 18g wire
288-1093-ND which is a 7mm long terminal for 16g wire
288-1099-ND which is a 7mm long terminal for 18g wire.
(you can order 10, 50, or 100 qty... or go direct and there is a 1000 qty
min)

... the problem now is that DigiKey doesn't sell the correct "Ind 20-14L"
indentation crimp tool from American Electrical Inc. so the search is not
quite over.... maybe I'll just go direct.


Now, here is the poll....

Since not all the ends had these little brass terminals, which ends should
have ends and which ends should be soldered (tinned)????

Oh, and one last item, I'd like to find an original dome light wire and
ambulance fan wire... they should be sheathed with the black casing
material.  Anyone?
