Subject: Bus front courtesy steps / shift extensions

For all of you that were waiting I wanted to let you know that I have a
2nd order of Bus steps and shift extensions in. The extensions are
$12.00 the steps are $40.00 for a pair. Or if wanted I will sell the
pads a separately for $23 pr. and the brackets separately for $27 pr.
I'm going to try and make it to the Toy/Lit show, and OCTO this weekend,
but I can't guarantee anything...........


Thanks,
Greg
