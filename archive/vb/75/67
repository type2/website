Pete,

Short answer:  Yes they make all sorts of carbs to fit VW engines, but you
really should pull the motor to change the manifold.

Long answer:  You CAN change the manifold without pulling the motor,  I
suppose, but you would be doing yourself a great disservice!  To take the
manifold off, you would need to:

Remove the manifold bolts(end casting bolts if it is a dual port).
Loosen the manifold enough to lift the generator(alternator)away for
clearance
Possibly remove the generator stand.
replace the stock manifold with your new manifold.
re-assemble the whole lot.

You will have to perform these tasks even with the engine out, but at least
you get some breathing room!  To pull the motor, you just need a jack, a
17mm, screwdriver, and a basic socket set.

Back when I had my head on straight, I could pull a motor, and do that work,
and have the engine back in an hour(maybe an hour and a half!)

Pull the motor if you at all can.  Save yourself some frustration.

The trip is on....
