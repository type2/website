There are several VW parts suppliers in the Hot VW and VW Trends mags that
sell "Boosters". These replace your screw with an adjustable srew that
allows you to increase pressure on your stock spring. All of the ones that I
have seen on engines that come to me have had leaky threads. The best thing
to do is buy a Boost kit which gives you a better piston and stronger
springs.

Can the springs themselves be changed to alter the pressure settings?
