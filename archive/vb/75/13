Subject: What is ZA delivery port?

This is for a LHD, left side rear door, double cab.
One thing to note is that it has mcodes for a mph speedo and sealed
headlight beams. (among other non related items such as tilt, and safaris)
It was found in a junkyard in MO.
Anyone have any guesses about ZA delivery port? Its not on any list that I
have found.
Also wasn't an "American package"  m-code required on all buses delivered
to america like 362?
