Subject: VW Logo and legal static

While driving to work today I saw very clean bay with no VW emblem on the
front.

This got me thinking...WHEREAS VWofA is quite stingy with its logos AND they
do not really support the vehicles we love...

I wonder why any of us allow the VW logo to be on our wonderful vehicles at
all?

What do you think?
