Subject: RE: [VB] Engine Troubles...HELP!!!

has been suggested by many that there is a manifold leak between the heat
riser and intake pipe.
also has been suggested to take a piece of metal and put it under the heat
risers (both sides) where they meet the muffler to seal the heat risers,
thereby sealing the leak if any, and seeing what happens when the engine is
started.  
gonna try that tomorrow and see what happens...........
thanks for all the input, keep it coming!


oh yeah, it's a 1600cc single port engine.
