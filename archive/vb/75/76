Subject: Universal Corporation, new webpage

Here is the new Universal Corporation homepage:

http://www.universal-co.com/

They make a great product in the Tiger 581 and excellent customer support...
Granted it is not listed these days only the 681 which used to be their
"high-end" unit.  Hoover is a big advocate for the 581 as well and who
turned me onto it.

I know John at aircooled.net is a distributor of Universal Corp products as
well.  Used to be only directly through Universal Corp.
