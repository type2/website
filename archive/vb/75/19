Hi Kurt,
Sounds fishy!  Best to remove the engine and figure what has been done in 
there and what needs replacing before things tear themselfs apart.  Get a 
resistor for the wiper motor or it will not last much longer and 66 motors do 
not grow on trees anymore.  Check your speedo cable connections and replace 
the cable if needed.

  I've heard that a bushing needs to be changed in the tranny for this to 
work.  My

If your starter works when jumpered with a screw driver or open wrench, it is 
fine.  Though you need to know if it matches the FW or not!  Your battery 
cable could still be bad due to not being able to pass enough amperage, but 
since your starter jumpered fine that does not sound like the problem.  So 
you need to check, clean, and solder (Especially the fuse box parts and 
headlight switch pieces!) the connections from the starter to the fuse box, 
to the headlight switch to the ignition switch, and back to the solinoid.  
Check the type2 library for the article we wrote with Matt on headlight 
switch cleaning and soldering for brighter whiter headlights, signals and 
better starting.   Eric&Barb
