Hi Pete,
If you mean a two barrel in one carb there are only very antiquated vintage 
models of those.  You can change the intake manifold with the engine in, but 
it is a heck of alot easier to just remove the engine.  While out check the 
tranny and clutch.  Some friends of our's used to drive thier fleet of 
Westies with a small venturi sized dual carbs on stocker 1600 SP engines with 
stock exhausts.  Great low end torque, increased HP in the 2,000 to 3,000+ 
RPM range and nearly bomb proof.
