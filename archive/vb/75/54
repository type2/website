Subject: RE: [VB] Final verdict on oil hemorrhage

Springs in oil pump, springs in oil pump, I seem to remember two little
gears in there but no springs. Has my engines been missing something? Should
I go get oil pump springs? What's the VW part number?

Well, it turns out that the springs in the oil pump were reversed. Not
sure how *that* happened, but just glad that it's well again. I'm going
to pick it up now...

not long ago I started finally replaced the dead generator on my 65 and
started her up.  It was a cold day (intermittant snow) and the oil
filter
(screw on to pump) blew and spit oil everywhere. what a PITA! ran to the
FLAPS store and bought a slightly pricer one (which cost about $6) that
has
the pressure relief spring.  30 wt oil at about 30*F was just too thick
for
the filter, but the spring relief one worked fine.    Dunno how cold it
is
where you are, what weight oil you are using, or how much pressure your
pump
is putting out, but I do recommend spending the extra couple bucks for
the
filter with the relief valve.  Just in case you had the non relief kind.

 On the way to work this morning, the new oil filter they put on
 exploded. I am getting the feeling that the oil pump valve is sticking
 and the pressure is building to a *slightly* unacceptable level. It is
 back in the shop to get the spring checked.

 Yeah! I love my bus! :(
