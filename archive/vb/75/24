Subject: Repop parts suggestion

I was wondering why there wasn't a little more variety
in the mudflap department now that VW showed the might
and forced the logo ones off the market. Why hasn't
anyone repopped the Sargeant stripe style? I am not
interested in the Mr. Bubblehead style, and I had the
EMPI ones at one point. But I am looking for something
more stock and vintage oriented. Or if anyone knows of
old style mudflaps or other manufacturers, let me
know.
 Mike
