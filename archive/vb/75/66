You can install a 32/36 center mount Weber although loosening the intake
manifolds and routing everything through is a pain on an installed engine.
Heard it can be done.

Hi List,
Can anyone tell me if there is a 2 barrel carb for a
1600 DP and and if so, can you change out the manifold
without pulling the engine?
Thanks,
3DPete
