Subject: RE: [VB] Highroof Rear Hatch

Hi!

	I guess Ronnie has outed me again...
	Unfortunately, I did not find a specific way to tell the difference between
the two types of rear hatches.

	I was mainly looking to answer the same question you originally had.  Are
they different.

	The only thing I can add, is pretty much what everyone else has said.
There is little to no curve to the high roof door.  Look at it from a side
profile and see if you can notice a definite arch from top to the bottom of
the door.  If you notice it straighten out near the top, then it's most
likely a high roof door.

	Pretty much, you need to try installing it on a bus to find out 100% sure.

If Roger N is out there he might have the answer. At the last few shows
I've seen him at he was checking out every High Roof rear hatch there trying
to figure out if and what were the differences
