Subject: Re: [VB] Engine Troubles...HELP!!!

oh yeah sorry. 1600cc engine. nothing fancy. factory rebuilt stamped "H"
case, but appears to have later 8mm oil passages and has bosses for 68-71
bus engine hanger. 
also, there are no cylinder shims under the cylinders, which if the case
has been decked by vw, may be a reason for higher compression. (thanks Dave
for the suggestion)
