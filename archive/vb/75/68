If they didn't install belly pans when they did the conversion I would do so
now. VW put belly pans in both double doors and sunroof buses to preserve
structural integrity. Kelly makes them, and the prototype set I saw looked
good. I think his web site is at www.metwiz.com

Folks,

I have a'66 Kombi that was retro'ed with a '63 23 window rag top.  The guy I
bought it from put in cargo doors on the drivers side to turn it into a jump
through, and it had already beed converted to a bucket seat walk through, by
cutting out the center and bending down the panel that runs along behind the
bench seat.

I haven't really driven it yet, as my son and I are  building up a Bergmann
1835cc long block.  It is taking time because of the extreme weather . . .
watch for us on tv tomorrow night . . . opening ceremonies!  No, not at $800
a ticket!  But we do live right next to the women's hockey venue . . .

My question is, should I replace the solid panel that was originally behind
the bench seats?  It seems to me that would give me back some significant
structural strength.  I happen to have a '67 Westy who's rear interior was
torn out and the body is in bad shape.  The front seat panel is still in
good shape though.  I could just drill out the pop welds, clean it up a
little and take out the messy walk through set up and reinstall the panel.

Is it worth it?  I noticed the white and peach custom in this month's Hot
VW's, 23 window, jump through/walk through.  I wonder what they did to beef
up the structural integrity of the body/frame?

I enjoy this list!  Fun stuff.  I've been driving a VW air-cooled since I
got my licence back in 1965!

Best,

Curt Conklin
