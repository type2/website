Subject: Long shot

   I have a customer who is doing a perfect resto on a 1960 single cab and
has hit a snag. He needs a PERFECT 59-61 deck lid. His original had welds on
it and doesn't want to live with that. He also needs 4 commercial hubcaps,
NO DENTS but need repaint OK.
  He is willing to pay TOP DOLLAR for these items. The bus is in the body
shop, ready for paint and they just discovered the bus had a 64 deck lid
(the one he e-bought, represented as a 1960). He also got e-burned and
bought 4 NOS ha ha commercial hub caps that came from Brazil but were
represented as NOS German, he's learned.

there for him
