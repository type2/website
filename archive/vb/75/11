Subject: Hello, new bus owner

Hello everyone,

I just bought my first bus (1966 21 window) in January and I'm happy as a 
clam.  I've been following the list for the past few weeks and I've been 
blown away at how friendly and helpful everyone is.  Cheers to type2.com for 
setting up this forum for so many excellent and knowledgeable people to 
communicate.

I have a fair amount of restoration work to accomplish so I'll probably be 
bothering ya'll alot.

My current problem is that the bus wont start.  (It will push start fine).  
When I turn the key over the engine does a sluggish half attempt at 
starting.  Battery is fully charged and the cables are all good (I've tested 
the voltage from the battery to the solenoid and that looked great).  I 
hooked a jumper up to bypass the solenoid (err a screwdriver ;) and the 
starter whirred to life.  I've taken the starter out (not as easy as I 
thought it would be) and here is where I'm at.

The PO said the old starter (6 volt) died (didn't explain much)and so he 
went out and bought a 12 volt starter (the bus has been converted to 12 volt 
but I can't tell how thorough of a job was done [wipers go so fast they must 
still be 6 volt + speedometer dosen't work but I'm not sure if that would be 
effected]).  I'm 99% positive that the flywheel is still the smaller 6volt 
size but the PO said the rebuilt 12v starter he bought was designed for a 6v 
flywheel.  Have any of you heard of this?  I've heard that a bushing needs 
to be changed in the tranny for this to work.  My current thinking is to try 
a new solenoid on the supposedly "new" rebuilt 12v starter.  Sorry if my 
questions seem a bit stuipid, I'm very new with busses and automechanics in 
general.  I have a Bently and the Idiots guide but I was wondering if any of 
ya'll know of a hint or trick I'm missing before I go waste my $.
