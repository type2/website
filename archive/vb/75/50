You might also want to check throttle plate bushings on your carbs and float
bowl gasket defects too. I had the sad experience of getting a batch of
Brazilian carbs that were all bad. I fixed two and shelved the rest for when
I got into the carb rebuilding mood again. A long time ago I gave up on
returning carbs for replacement if it was cheaper for me to repair, an make
sure it was right. Besides, jet matching to the vehicle usage at the time of
build is always best. I prefer to do it all at the same time so that when I
load up and engine on the start up stand I can set everything at once.

Jon, Have you set up a vacuum gauge? We know how much you like gauges.
Because like Ronnie we think vacuum LEAK but where?  Intake manifold sounds
to
be the only thing you have not exchanged externally.
What about a High lift and over lapping cam??
What did Rachel think about -- (later i held up a white towel to the
tailpipe
for about 10 minutes--came
away clean)?
