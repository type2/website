actually end of 54 in that context means end of barndoor production, which is 
in early 1955
============
 
  211 601 027E, 4.5K X 15, from chassis # 20-117 902 [1955] up to # 1 219 510

yes, early 64s (model year started in fall 63) came with the 15" rims.  
interesting as they are one tons, but the '63 option one tons evidently came 
with 14" rims. Joel on the list has an early 64 with its original 15" rims, 
which he has been doing much intrepid exploring in.   

you can fit 205 75 15s on the 15" rims and fit them in the wheel wells of the 
flat wheel well (like a 61) bus, but wider tires will not fit into the flat 
wheel wells.  At least there might be problems installing them unless you let 
air out of the tires.   the later (slightly flared) wells do give a tad more 
space.

the size IS stamped on the rims.
