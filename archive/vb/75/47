Subject: RE: [VB] What exhaust should I use?

Look forward of the zoomy tube and check out the tiny exaust pipe leading
into it! These "gofast" zoomy cars are becoming real popular up here in the
Puget Sound. It cracks me up to see the dents and dings and repairs to them,
they just gotta take the chances at every stop light.

Funny, most of the Civics I see running around here have 
a big 'ol coffee can looking exhaust...that and a huge 
wing on the back!
