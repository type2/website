Thanks for all the suggestions.

It turned out the wire from the headlight switch to the ignition switch had
come loose. That explained the lack of lights on the speedo pod. The battery
was also a little weak from sitting. I've got it on a trickle charger, and
I've got a battery jumper I've just plugged in.

 

Hopefully I'll get it started in the next day or two.
