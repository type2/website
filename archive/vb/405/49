Subject: Re: [VB] Heat: Finding Leaks, Keepin' it Warm

back in 1979 (I was 19) and did not mind the cold in my 69 bus,, but my  
girl friend froze. I lived in New York and drove all over the state in  
any temperature.

I insulated as best I could and put a curtain up.  Oddly the bus had a  
gas heater because it was used as a pre school school-bus bus. The  
heater went on fire years before and was junk.

I had a great idea-use an external oil cooler for heat.  So I removed  
the engine and put an external oil cooler in place of the stock filter.  
I built a nice box with a fan from an American
car (it had great air flow). I made a flap to direct air flow  either  
out of the engine compartment or inside the bus. I hooked a control  
wire to the box and up to the driver. I added a conduit to run the heat
up to the drivers area (split  
seat)...................................................................

GUESS WHAT HAPPENED?  NFG the air coming out of the box was luke warm.

So I know one way that will not work!  only 999 to go.

I live in south florida and the heat works great in my 67 standard-it  
is called the sun. It is 80 today. truth be told I hate florida.


Question: are gas heaters available and for what price. Are these new,  
NOS or new new?

thanks for the memories-I still have all my toes.  If you want to feel  
REAL cold try riding a motorcycle in the winter. I rode down to 8  
degrees F till my eyes froze.
