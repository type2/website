Hello Fellow Volks Folks,

Nobody says it better than our Canadian friends to the North. 

Thanks to Greg Potts for the some Hints and Tips for Winter Camping below.

 

Forecast for this Saturday at Pokagon State Park in Angola, Indiana is for

a high of 30F and a low of 8F at night.  We handled colder last year!

********************************************************

True Canadian Hints for Winter Camping at Bus BRR*

 

1) Wear a toque at all times, esp. at night.

 

2) Dress in layers. Remove layers when required to keep from sweating. 

Sweat =wet, and wet=cold.

 

3) Wool or fleece is warmer than cotton and nylon.

 

4) Nylon outer layers are good to keep out snow and ice

 

5) Leave the bug spray at home for this trip.

 

6) Eat lots of high-carb foods. Winter camping REQUIRES 5000 calories per
day.

 

7) Drink lots of fluids.

 

8) Bring a chair to sit on.

 

9) A foam cushion will help keep your tush warmer when seated. Closed-cell
foam

works well for this (carpet underlay)

 

10) Alcohol might make you feel warm, but since it promotes perspiration it
will

actually lower your body temperature. Be VERY careful when mixing alcohol

with cold weather camping.
