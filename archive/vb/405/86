hey guys  this would only matter if you were Wanting to put a 12 v  flywheel 
on it. The 6 V flywheel will fit both types of cranks. You can make a  12V 
flywheel fit a 6v crank by cutting the lip out where the o ring goes and  using a 
6v flywheel gasket.  The 66 bus and ghia ^V flywheel is 200mm which  will 
enable you top use a larger clutch.  Another thing I do use to use a  rabbit 
Diesel clutch disc as they will take more torque and last longer   later  mark
