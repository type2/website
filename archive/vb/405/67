Subject: BusFusion 2008 is happening!!!

 Rumours of the demise of BusFusion have been greatly exaggerated!!!

BusFusion will take place this year as usual at the Fairgrounds in Almont,
Ontario --- June 12 to 15. The fairgrounds are already booked

We will be updating the website shortly with registration and and info about
activities for this year ---- but please mark this on your calendars now.

If you've never been to this great Bus event please check out
www.busfusion.com for details of the location and past activities as well as
lots of pics and videos.

Please direct all inquiries to busfusion(-at-)gmail.com

My apologies if this seems like a repeat posting --- some of the lists have
been grumpy about gmail lately.

See you there!!!

Cheers,

Mike Cuff
