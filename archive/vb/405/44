Tom,

Once you install the new seals, do the paper test. Take a 1" wide strip of 
paper and close the door on it and pull it to see if the seals are tight 
against the closed door. Do this about every 6" around the door. If not 
tight, then shim the seals out until you get a tight fit. Paper is not a 
good shim. Use plastic. Another benefit is a quieter cab, less wind noise.
