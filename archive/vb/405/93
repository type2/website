FWs can be 

6V or 12V
big clutch or little clutch
stepped or O-ring.

most common are 
6V little clutch stepped,
and
?12V large clutch o-ring,

but there are other combinations.??
 Basically, it is best to have a stepped FW on a stepped crank, and the o-ring FW on the later crank.? 

So since?you need a new 6V FW, you should find out whether you want stepped or o-ring and what size clutch

hey guys  this would only matter if you were Wanting to put a 12 v  flywheel 
on it. The 6 V flywheel will fit both types of cranks. You can make a  12V 
flywheel fit a 6v crank by cutting the lip out where the o ring goes and  using 
a 
6v flywheel gasket.  The 66 bus and ghia ^V flywheel is 200mm which  will 
enable you top use a larger clutch.  Another thing I do use to use a  rabbit 
Diesel clutch disc as they will take more torque and last longer   later  mark
