Subject: Arizona Bus Club Brunch Run

Our congratulations to Dan, for the Best Ever Food Run.  126 miles of almost
raw desert scenery,  hand made burgers, home made raisin power bars, a lot
of up and down hills , very friendly people that we met that live out that
way, and the list goes on and on. No problems driving on a road that is a
river bed when it rains. Magoo drove the whole route, she had so much fun,
she would not let me drive. We saw the historic landmark building,  stay
tuned pictures at 10PM   Wow what a "trip"  Bless you and thanks Dan, for
giving me one more delightful day with my beloved bride, uj
