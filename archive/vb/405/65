Hmm, That is odd if the headlights come on, the dash lights should too.

Can you check the battery voltage with the headlamps on?

I thought maybe the battery would be low, but if the headlightscome on nice
and bright(or as bright as 6 volts gets you) shouldn't the warning lights in
the dash pod light up when I turn the key?
