Subject: Re: [VB] Heat: Finding Leaks, Keepin' it Warm

As I'm not one to drill holes right outta the gate i'd check for air leaks first. Having a pedal pan and good seals on the clutch, brake, steering column and gas pedal makes a big difference.  
   
   The overhead vent seems to be the culprit more often than naught.
