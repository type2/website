HI Chris,

I thought maybe the battery would be low, but if the headlightscome on nice
and bright(or as bright as 6 volts gets you) shouldn't the warning lights in
the dash pod light up when I turn the key?

Was writ:
After 5 months of no charging, I would expect the battery to be rather low.
Put it onto a charger overnight.
