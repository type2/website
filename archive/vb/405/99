Subject: Re: [T2] at my wits end

Was never at my wits end. I have a weber progressive that can't take more 
than about 4 or 5 psi or the float will open and then fuel is pumped thru 
the mains. I had my fuel pressure regulator set at 2.5psi and flow was too 
low and again about 30 minutes into a freeway drive going up hill, the 
engine would poop and fart. Solution, set the regulator at 3.5 psi.
