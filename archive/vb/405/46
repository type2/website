Subject: Re: [VB] Heat: Finding Leaks, Keepin' it Warm

Greg put a bunch of NOS grey rubber in his 55, and that bus has NICE heat and it stays inside (to a high %).?? 
The passenger side upper cab door scraper is funky, so there is still a draft there.? :(

Regardless, in the teens it is not going to be toasty warm unless you have a?gas heater.? 
A gas heater kicks some serious butt in the comfort improvement zone during winter.? 

I've used 2" wide blue painters tape over drafty pop-outs, intake grill for the fresh air grill inlet, rear hatch, sub hatch, etc on those very sub-freezing days.?? 
The blue painters tape will peel off w/o leaving messy residue or peeling the paint?(duct tape will- don't use duct tape).?

Newspaper under the front floor mat can help cut down on drafts from rust holes there.

? It's a quick and not too dirty solution. :)
