a couple of things.

1 can you physically spin the engine by hand or wrench or push it in 
gear and make the engine turn-just to make sure it is not seized?

2 We used to run the six volt starter when doing 12 volt conversions or 
with off road buggies.  They ran for years .  So I am thinking that if 
you isolate or unhook the rest of the car from the
engine you might try to use a 12 volt battery just for a try.

3 just a story  -A great memory of mine is the time we were running a 
buggy on mud flats and got stuck. we had to leave the buggy over nite 
under 6 feet of salt water
the next day we got it back and washed out the engine. My uncle stopped 
by with the garbage truck-which had a 24 volt system. Yes yes that 
engine practically jumped
  off the bench when it started-had a 6v starter.
