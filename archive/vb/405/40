Chris,

Yeah, I've been avoiding the gas heater route - not sure why, really, mainly just 
because it seems like it would be one more thing to maintain.  Then again, I
guess that depends on how much time I end up putting into trying to tune
up the stock system.

I've also considered putting a plastic sheet divider between the cab and the rest 
of the bus.  I was going to try it with plastic drop-cloth first to see if it
worked, then do it right with plexiglass (so I can see through it without any
problems).  I haven't quite gotten that far though.

As an aside, I don't think the heat loss through the glass is as bad as one
might think: at least not compared to the amount of heat that's coming in with
even one cfm of 105degF air...  At least that's what my back-of-the-envelope 
engineering calcs make me think, so I'm betting on leaks at this point.

Cheers,
    Avo
