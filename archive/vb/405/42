Subject: Re: [VB] Heat: Finding Leaks, Keepin' it Warm

Drafts make a huge difference.
Grey rubber around all doors.
Good felts on the front door windows.
Scrapers on the front door windows and the pop out
Over head air vent... any air coming in there, or over the headliner? Do you need to goop the sides?

You can hang a curtain between front and back.

I find that stock heat is good down to about 30F, with good seals on the doors.
Is your heat opening all the way?
Do you have your thermostat stuff in place?


A gas heater is really an awesome accessory in freezing weather.



I would not hack for a "re-circulation system"
The stock heat should be coming out of the ducts nice and toasty. ... 
So hot that you can't keep your fingers by the vents (once the engine has warmed up).
