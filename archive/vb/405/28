ok chris

today i drove to work with the spl meter.
idle sitting around 92db
driving at xway speeds ranges from 96 to 102.
pretty typically around 99-100
i did some testing with coasting at xway speed and revving the engine
while stopped.
most of my noise seems to be wheels/wind

windows open, c weighted.

the loudest of 105 was when a particularly annoying semi passed me.
