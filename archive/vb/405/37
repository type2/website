Hey Avacodo,

Get yourself a gas heater and call it a day.
Its hard to get all the doors and windows sealed up. Gotta pay careful 
attention to the seals to get them to fit tight.

Also, the windows are a large area of heat loss. Maybe if you insulate 
those? Might be a little hard to see out however.
How about double paning the windows with some sheets of plexiglass or 
polycarbonate?
