Hey, Volks:

 

Getting things in order for a February 9th road trip to Buses by the Beach
Bus BRR at wonderful Pokagan State Park in Angola, Indiana.  We're going to
bring a nice beef stew for crock pot.  It's great to come back from the
toboggan runs to some warm stew and a big fire.

 

I'll be rolling into Campground #3 around 12:30PM to get the fire going.

I'm looking forward to seeing old friends and making some new ones!  Also
excited to see the brand new Buses by the Beach hoodies and pint logo
glasses.

 

The weather forecast on weather.com 10-day forecast is for a high of 30 (F)
and a low at night of 20 (F).  It's looking better than last year (-5F) and
closer to the averages for that time of year in Northern Indiana.  Also,
Ranger Ted says the heated bathrooms with showers will be available to us
for the first time this year.  Much better than frozen pit toilet!

 

Can't wait to get in the bus and see everybody again.  Just got word Jake
and Julie will be rolling in from Cincinnati.

 

All are welcome!

Chili, Stew or something to share. There are electric hook ups on each
campsite.  Get the buses  leveled, pop the top (and insulated!) and start
the heaters.

 

Then, it's off to the wild toboggan runs for some 35-40 mph runs on the two

side by side refrigerated tracks.   Back to the campsite later on for all

different kinds of Pot Luck Chili, music (Bring and instrument if you play

one!) and great bus talk around the big fire.  Make sure to include the
fantastic brunch at the rustic Potawatomie Inn on your calendar for the next
day, Sunday February 10 th, before hitting the road.

Last year, the daytime temps were unseasonably cold and the low at night was

-5 degrees.   Despite the cold, we were warm in our '87 Westy, JoesVan with

an electric heater running all night.  Most campers lined their poptops with
Mylar sheets before bed and ran small electric heaters or kept the top

down.     Average temps for Angola, Indiana are highs of 32 degrees and lows

of 14 degrees with a mean average of 24 degrees.   This has been the case

the 1st two years.
