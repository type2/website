Subject: Re: [VB] Easier way to replace trans side cover seal?

Hi Conrad,
Heard of some who have cut the gaskets and put each on with cut in  different 
upper positions.  That with a little RTV sealant finger  painted on seems to 
work.  Still you have to get JUST the right amount of  gaskets, not over 
torque the fasteners, and make sure the DPO did not over  torque them distorting 
the sheet metal there.
