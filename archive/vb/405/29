Andy,

Wow,  Great information. Tracks pretty good with my results. So, buses are 
noisy. Be really great if I can figure out how to make them reasonably 
quiet.

I'm now planning to do an engine overhaul and check all the balancing and 
head cc's and deck heights.
My engine is a bit of a shaker and I think most of my noise is from the 
engine.

Chris

 today i drove to work with the spl meter.
 idle sitting around 92db
 driving at xway speeds ranges from 96 to 102.
 pretty typically around 99-100
 i did some testing with coasting at xway speed and revving the engine
 while stopped.
 most of my noise seems to be wheels/wind

 windows open, c weighted.

 the loudest of 105 was when a particularly annoying semi passed me.
