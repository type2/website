Subject: Re: [VB] Heat: Finding Leaks, Keepin' it Warm

Well, it was last January in Utah on the way home from the Havasu campout.??? There was an artic blast blowing down from Canada, and it had got down to minus 23 F the previous night.?? I needed something QUICK!
A trip to Ace Hardware found the painter's tape.?? It was still minus temps in the parking lot putting the tape on the bus.? 
It immediately cut down on the drafts, and that was excellent.

?The bus had been parked for ~25 years, and we did a bunch of work to it, but reached a stopping point and called it good for a driver/ camper.?? It is not fully restored or draft free? :)? I plan to get a bit of metal repair done, and more new seals, but the tape was an instant fix.?

It rarely gets below 20F here, and the stock heat and eberspacher are fine for that even with the drafts, so the painters tape has not gone back on.

Instead of painter's tape, try some magnetic vinyl cut to shape. Easy on, easy off. Store behind the seat. ?
