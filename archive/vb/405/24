Subject: Re: [VB] SoCal  beach campsite in February ?

Bolsa Chica State Beach is very close to OCTO. The only drawback is that 
the campsite is just a section of the parking lot. It is right there at 
the beach though. Because of the parking lot setting, the neighbors are 
very close with little separation between the campers. The closest 
non-parking lot campsites would be at San Clemente State Beach. It is a 
bit of a walk to get to the sand though.
