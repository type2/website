Clara,

Heater boxes are wide open and functioning.  
Thermostat is in place and functioning.  I should probably verify that it's set
properly, and may do that the next time I take her out.  

Temps have been in the teens and 20s which is part of why i'm tuning (and chilled) 
and I've been getting up to about 40degF in the cabin, but not much more.

I've got rubber around all the doors, but it's old and pretty compacted - I may
throw some weatherstripping on there as a stop-gap to see if that helps, then 
order fresh rubber if it does.  

I think the window felt and scrapers could stand some attention, so I'll probably
hit that next.  

I think the overhead vent is pretty tight, but I'll verify.

thanks for all the tips...
