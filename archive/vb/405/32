Hey Rennie,

The plan is to simply check all the parameters: deck height, cc the heads, 
check and maybe lap the valves and seats, check and rebalance all rotating 
parts and put it all back together again. I suspect that there is something 
not right. The engine imo is a bit of a shaker.

Can you (or anyone else) think of any other details that should be checked 
out?

The engine is:
1776 dp, scat counterweighted crank, scat con rods, scat cam, scat heads, 
chrome moly push rods, 1.25 rockers, 8.0 cr, Weber progressive carb, all in 
a brand new case. (no onions please)

I have a bunch of stock VW tin that I'll use on the reassembly including the 
thermostat and flaps you helped me with at the WCM sale.

Need to clean out a corner of the garage before I start, maybe this weekend.

Chris
