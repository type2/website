Hi Tristan, 

Just to clarify-are you suggesting there is a bad link between the headlight
switch and the ignition switch?

-Kevin


IIRC, the oil & gen lights get power directly from the ignition
switch, the ig switch gets power from the light switch, and the light
switch gets power from the unfused side of the fuse block.  Since your
headlights work and the oil/gen lights don't, I'm guessing there is an
open or high resistance joint in the red wire between the headlight
switch and ignition switch.  I would put a meter on the red wire
connection to the ignition switch and work from there.

Doesn't explain why phreaking the starter didn't work, though.

Good Luck,
Tristan
