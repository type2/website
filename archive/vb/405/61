Subject: starting bus?

I have just come back from some time away from my bus. I had disconnected
the battery prior to my storage. Approximately  5 months.

Today I hooked up the battery to try to start it, and it doesn't want to
start. No noise at all. The lights in the speedo pod(oil & gen) do not even
light when I turn the key. I tried shorting the solenoid, and also get
nothing.

I checked the battery, and it has a decent charge - 6.2V. The headlights and
wiper work. I pulled the ignition switch to short the connection, as
suggested by muir, and get nothing. 

What should I try next?

Thanks for any suggestions.

Oh yeah-I have installed one of those starter relays, as I had the hot start
problems since I bought it. I checked the fuse on it, and it is ok.
