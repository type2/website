Hi JP,
Yes, but finding the shops that can is getting harder as time goes  on.  
Rimco is one of the better known VW shops that will do it or you can  check with 
your local FW shop.  Good to have the crank and FW balanced  together 
afterward.  Makes for a much smoother less vibrating engine,  resulting in a quieter 
VW.  VW originally factory painted the FW and  crank with balance marks.
E&B
