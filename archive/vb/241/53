Subject: Re: [VB] front sway bar 

Check out Sway-A-Way (SAW) for a 7/8" front bar.

Also Bus Boys lists a few different options:

There used to be a 1" available but I cannot remember from where.  Probably 
not worth it over a 7/8" bar anyway.  The rear is the weak link in a bus 
handling not the front.

Good luck,
Adrian
