 Well tonight I had a little play around, was able to shift the box relatively
 easy using mole grips on the selector, 4th still tough to get out of though.
 
 Found my old shift plate, and refitted that - I can now select all the gears,
 but it isn't easy to get into 2nd or 4th still, but it seems that my shifter
 is too worn.  If I select first, I quite a lot of rotational movement.  If I
 hold the shifter into the centre of this movement, I can then select 2nd by
 pulling directly back with ease.
 
 4th I can get out of, by a quick flick off the shifter.  If I apply a
 gradually increasing force it does not want to come out.
 
 I think I am going to drive it for a mile or so to get the oil round the box
 and see what it is like.
 
 If it is still poor I may try Clara's trick of running the box on 30weight 
for
 a bit and see what happens then.
 
 Any other ideas??

FWIW< that was just to clean the amazing thick dirty goop old oil dirt scum 
mixture out.    I wouldn't do it is your oil is not nasty.    And I only 
drove around the block a few times *literally!!!!!!*  I mean, I doubt 30 wt 
will lube enough if the tranny is properly warmed up.  But it sure did flush 
stuff out!!!!!!!!!!  This tranny sat a while huh?

Some times tranny's get crunchy from after sitting for years.  and then 
'loosen up' a bit after getting a work out.    However, it'll not 
spontaneously go back to perfect,    I've had good results adding the slick 
50 tranny goo to hard to shift trannies. 

 But eventually you might want to plunk down the dough for a rebuilt tranny.  
  Still, it can last for years, and tens of thousands of miles.
