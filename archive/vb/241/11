Subject: Vegas to Classic?

Anyone going to the Classic that is coming from Phoenix? I could use help
in transporting a Dealership sign out this way. I'll be glad to throw some
gas money your way.

Any interested bus folks please pmail me off list at
scott(-at-)motifstudios.com, or at this address.

Thanks!

Scott Mc Williams
