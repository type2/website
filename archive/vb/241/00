Subject: Bus Sunroof Question

All,

I am trying to put together my 66 bus sunroof and am having some problems 
with the black, cylindrical bows behind the main, square, silver bows.  
First of all, I am not sure what these are called.  Second, I am wondering 
if I do not have the correct bows because they seem a bit too short 
lengthwise.  Does anyone know the correct length of these trailing bows and 
how they should be installed?

Richard
