Subject: Bus Dimensions

Hi,
I am looking into getting my first camper in a few months and so I'm doing a 
few designs for the inside.  As I've never been in a split screen bus I am 
only guessing at the dimensions which isn't easy.

Please could anybody help me with the basic internal dimensions of a split 
screen bus, if it didn't have anything inside.  Length (with/without cab), 
width and height.

Thanks
Simon
