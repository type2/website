You need to tell us which carb you are using.

Hot start usually means the engine will only turn over and start reliably 
when cold, when warm/hot it barely turns over and maybe/possibly/perhaps 
start, or not turn over at all.  Almost always this is due to corroded/loose 
electrical connections in the wiring system.
