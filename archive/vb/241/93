It might be worth noting that I have a closeout on '69-79 childs cots,
for $39.95 (originally $100). This includes the canvas and poles (but
not the mounts). At this price, it's worth it for the canvas alone (as
the original wholesale for the canvas section alone was more than $39),
and may be useful for someone thinking of putting in a cot even if they
did not use the poles (or cut/modified them).  Part # 7001
