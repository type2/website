Subject: Shifting problems - an update

Well tonight I had a little play around, was able to shift the box relatively
easy using mole grips on the selector, 4th still tough to get out of though.

Found my old shift plate, and refitted that - I can now select all the gears,
but it isn't easy to get into 2nd or 4th still, but it seems that my shifter
is too worn.  If I select first, I quite a lot of rotational movement.  If I
hold the shifter into the centre of this movement, I can then select 2nd by
pulling directly back with ease.

4th I can get out of, by a quick flick off the shifter.  If I apply a
gradually increasing force it does not want to come out.

I think I am going to drive it for a mile or so to get the oil round the box
and see what it is like.

If it is still poor I may try Clara's trick of running the box on 30weight for
a bit and see what happens then.

Any other ideas??

Thanks
Paul
