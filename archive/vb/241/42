Subject: RE: [VB] pimpride steering wheels

Chris Dreike, listee and Steering Wheel Man takes OG wheels, removes all the 
molded material and pours new material around the metal armature and into a 
mold taken from an NOS wheel. I have two and they're great. Not sure if he's 
still producing, but save those "hopeless", beat up old wheels for him. Patched 
wheels are OK, but Chris' have all the nubs and are as solid as OG.
