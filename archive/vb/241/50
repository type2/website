Subject: RE: [VB] more support for "steering man"/done

  I just got off the phone with Chris The Steering Wheel Man and he is going
back into production. The steering wheels can only be purchased though me.
  The first offerings will be available in 60 days, we do not have the price
set yet and hope to keep it around the same as before, somewhere between 175
to 200 dollars exchange. Your core can be bare metal as long as it is not
bent or cracked (the metal) and the center hub is good.
  They will be available in BLACK and maybe the ivory color.

If interested in placing a pre-order p-mail me. This will put you on a list
and updated as to the progress and shipping dates, no obligation to
purchase. No deposit required to put your name on the list.

If someone is making a list of potential customers, put me on it!
