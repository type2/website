  They are made by Flat 4 and sold and imported through Moon Eyes. They are
flimsey and would bend if you tried to pull yourself up in your bus with
them.
  Flat 4 only made them in Ivory and ISP is painting them black.

ronnie  hope this helps

What's the quality of these wheels? Anyone bought or used one? Are 
they made to be "used" or for show cars? Will it only crack and break 
a year down the road?
