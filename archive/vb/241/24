Subject: clocks and such

Hello List,
I am in want of a 12 volt clock and gas gauge. I would prefer not to use a 
voltage drop. I also remember reading about a person or company that rebuilt 
clocks to 12 volt specs. Any leads would be greatly appreciated.  Also where 
can I get a restored steering wheel or send mine to be restored. I have done 
some of these myself but they always seem to crack later. I want one done 
professionally this time.
Thanks in advance for any assistance,
Boyd Smith
