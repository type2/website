Subject: westy louvered window seal

Hi lists.
anyone tell me if louvered window seal is available anywhere?
I know the Bay Westy's one is available but I dunno splittys.

Otherwise, are there any good idea to stop leaking from the louverd window?
The seal is shrunk and the window periphery is not completely sealed.

thanks for advance
