Hi Don,
First check the exhaust for leaks especially at where the muffler and heat 
exchangers seal to the heads.  Next wether or not there was an exhaust leak 
take out the engine and dissassemble the engine down to a longblock.  Then 
retorque ALL the engine and then ALL 16 head fasteners.  If one of the head 
studs strips/is stripped out of the threads in the case you can install a 
head stud with oversized threads, if this has already been done one can 
install a solid insert, if this was already done you might be able to install 
a bigger outer diameter solid insert, if that was already done you are most 
likely SOL and it is time for an engine rebuild with a differant case.  If 
the head stud hold reassemble the engine with new exhaust gaskets and after 
straightening any bent exhaust/HE flanges and hopefully that will fix the 
problem.  If not, the heads where they seal to the cylinders have been 
compromised, and/or perhaps due to case damage where the cylinders seat 
against is distorting the cylinders from sealing to the heads.
  While the engine is out it is a good time to inspect the starter, 
FW,starter bushing, clutch parts, various tranny stuff, and fuel lines!
