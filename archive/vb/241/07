Subject: Running very rich

I am running a 1600 SP with a 30 PICT 3 carb. Looking down the throat of 
the carb I can see the squirt of gas when I pump the accelerator. When I 
run the engine up to about 2000 RPM and higher I see gas dripping from 
the tube in the carb. Shouldn't  that circut be shut down when the 
engine revs up? What might be letting the fuel continue to flow from the 
idle circut at ligher RPMs?
