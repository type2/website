Subject: re:on saving stuff

I second the saving stuff idea, although it can be rather
difficult...luckily I saved my original horn when it stopped working.
Although at the time I could see no possible way of fixing it....3 years
later the "new" replacement broke, and I looked at the original again, and
with some searching of the archives, was able to resurect it....back to the
original horn!

the small things make me smile sometimes...
