Subject: Re: [VB] front sway bar

Front sway bars/anti-roll bars are a good idea on old buses.  Ralph 
Nader's Unsafe at Any Speed made a valid point that rear engine Beetles 
and Chevy Corvairs had a dangerous oversteer problem.  This oversteer, 
leading to a tendency for a car's front end to swap positions with the 
rear, got many drivers used to front engine american cars which had a 
huge amount of plow or understeer, in trouble.  The optional sway bar on 
the Corvair was made standard and Beetles also got sway bars.  These 
sway bars do not eliminate the oversteer issue but they do reduce it.

Sway bars work by reducing body roll.  The front ones are one piece with 
bent arms on the ends.  When in a turn, as the vehicle begins to roll, 
the outside turn end of the sway bars follow the suspension's torsion 
arms up.   The inside of the turn sway bar end also tries to move up, 
the bar's one piece, right.  This upward force on the inside of the turn 
suspension arm lowers that side of the car.  This flattens, reduces body 
roll in a turn.

Sway bars do give a less supple ride.  They somewhat reduce the front 
suspension's ability to work independently.  If you spent all of your 
time on rough roads driving 30mph you would not want a front sway bar.

I think that installing a front sway bar on a bus is a great idea which 
will make your bus a safer ride!!!   Camber compensators on the rear can 
also help, but they are a somewhat different animal......  Gary Gibson
