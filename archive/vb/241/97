Anyone have a photo of the brackets mounted in the cab?
Thanks

> As stated before no mods are needed to put an early (pre 68) cot in your
bus, just the bracketsare needed. There are at least four different styles
of childs cots; split bus (army green duck canvas, black round poles),
68-70-1 (round black poles, kahki colored canvas)) 71-? (square U channel
poles, kahki canvas) and the telescopic pole style.
