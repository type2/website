Ah maybe I won't then.  This tranny has only done 45k, it sat for about 13years I believe, then was driven for 3 years, then sat for a few years again, before been drained and removed about 18months ago.  So it has been drained a while.

I would like to be able to shift nicely so I guess I will have to!  My old box used to shift lovely, just used to pop out of fourth (my fault did not notice a leak and after a week being parked up camping, and then a 3hr drive home with little tranny oil)  

In future I will pull forward and check underneath before leaving a campsite!

Thanks
