I didn't even know there were felts until
I sandblasted the frames and found the remains.

The Wolfsburg kit is fairly complete,
but lacks the gray rubber buttons
that go between the glass and frame.
Got a good solution for that ?
faucet washers ?!

They're are available from several places.  I bought one from Wolfsburg and
one from Bus Depot.  The Wolfsburg one has the felt deal that goes against
the side of the windows when closed, the Bus Depot does not.  Wolfsburg's
were like $12 and Bus Depot was around $6.  I'm going with Wolfsburg for the
rest, I really like the idea of replacing that felt piece.
