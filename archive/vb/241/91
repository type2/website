Subject: Westy cot in non westy

Has anyone ever tried to make or modify a westy cot
to go in a non westy bus?
I think there are notches on the pillars for the ends of the poles
to go in on a true westy if I'm not mistaken. The split window era poles
would
be too long but maybe a bay cot with the telescoping poles would work?
I think I can weld up some poles to work but wanted to see if any of you
have tried something like this.
