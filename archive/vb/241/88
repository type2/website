 The other day i ran across a small tid-bit in the Bentley that said
 busses fitted with gas heaters were the ones to get the passenger side
 air cleaner, the others still on the drivers side. Perhaps this is a
 case of that.

 for a while the 1500 style hangers for air cleaner were on the left. around 
63.   the air cleaner had the breather spout on the other side, so it'd face 
the buses' right side.

ya, get an air cleaner on that motor, and turn the filter around.

Cute pics of the kid.  The motor is the right height for someone that size to 
work on.
