Subject: RE: [VB] roller bearing cranks

They are SPG, not SKG....

They make a smooooth running motor and don't let anyone ever tell you
they need balancing!  I'll be putting a 82mm spg in the 59 double cab
vintage 2 liter motor...

My question about them is what was the wrist pin size... 20mm goes into
the 40hp and 22mm goes in the 1500 and later motors... Hey, wait a
minute, anyone know the wrist pin size of the 1300?

A week or so back I mentioned that a  buddy came across a set of roller 
bearing cranks and rods. The feedback I got was that they were SKG. He 
listed them for sale on the samba and there is a picture there. Was 
wondering if someone could take a look and see if that's what they were
or 
not. Here's the link:

I would also be curious about the advantages to using one of these. The 
seem pretty slick. I was told they aren't good for the dragstrip...but
are 
nice in a street machine. What's the scoop?
