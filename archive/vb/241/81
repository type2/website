Subject: Re: [VB] westy louvered window seal

They're are available from several places.  I bought one from Wolfsburg and
one from Bus Depot.  The Wolfsburg one has the felt deal that goes against
the side of the windows when closed, the Bus Depot does not.  Wolfsburg's
were like $12 and Bus Depot was around $6.  I'm going with Wolfsburg for the
rest, I really like the idea of replacing that felt piece.
