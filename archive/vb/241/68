Subject: Re: [VB] painting cargo floor wit POR

Thing is por-15 is it doesn't dry like normal paint.  It absorbs water when
it dries.  So on a humid day it will dry faster than it will on a dry day.
So ... it's unusual stuff.  The por-15 people say use only por-15 solvent.
Given how much the stuff costs in my opinion it is not worth saving a few
bucks and risking the por-15 not sticking.  And really, you would be only
saving a few bucks.  You can only thin por-15 5% so a little thinner goes a
long way.  And when you figure out $ per unit of por-15 thinner vs. lacquer
thinner it is different but not so different that you will save more than a
couple bucks.  I only thin with their solvent - but I do use lacquer thinner
to clean up.

I've por-15'd things on which the por-15 did not stick all that well.  Then
I've por-15'd things and followed their directions exactly.  I've used their
metal ready stuff on sand blasted parts.  Por-15 has always worked perfectly
when I followed their directions exactly.

I've used black underneath my bus but ... I figured it would be too hard to
hide so I used grey anywhere I was going to paint over.  I've painted the
cargo floor of my bus with grey.  I've even painted the inside of my engine
compartment with grey.  Then I used the tye coat primer and sanded and
painted - it looks nice.  I've used a lot of por-15 on my bus.

So got any pics of that mango bus posted anywhere?
