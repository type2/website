Subject: painting cargo floor wit POR

Hello

I have seen last yeard Metalwizard doing a cargo floor!

He sandblasted all the floor then used POR15 grey then  i think TIE COAT
primer from Por-15.

It was a nice job, and im asking myself if i should do the same, in grey or
use POR15 black...


Also i found using por-15 that i can use Lacquer solvent to remove por15, so i
wonder if i can use this stuff instead of the solvent they sell...

what da ya all think ?

I cant find this nice resto in my archive... but i remember it was nice!

mike
