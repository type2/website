Subject: cargo area divider

A long time ago, I remember seeing a panel van that had a divider between the
drivers area and the cargo area.  This divider went all the way to the ceiling
and If I remember correctly had a window in it so one could still see out the
back.  Was this a stock product?  If so, any ideas on where to get one?  it
would be for my '58 panel.
