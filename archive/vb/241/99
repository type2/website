Any reason a telescoping style bay cot would not hook into the split style
brackets?
If the poles are adjustable in length, I don't see a problem other than a
little bunching
of the canvas unless the brackets are not compatible. I want to install the
early style
brackets on the off chance that I find a correct cot but would like to use a
bay style for
now since that is what is readily available. Is this do-able?
