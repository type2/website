The body end goes to one of the studs that holds the front rubber mount
on.  (Page H2-2 of your '63-'67 Bentley, top picture).  The transmission
end goes to one of the nuts that holds the gear carrier onto the
differential housing.  In other words, coming back from the shift rod,
there are two sets of nuts: the first set (small nuts) holds the nose
cone to the gear carrier and the second set (bigger nuts) holds the gear
carrier to the differential housing.  The strap goes under one of these
bigger nuts.  (Page H-6 3 of your '63-'67 Bentley, top two pictures).
