I like to check for the cotter pins on any VW that is strange to me and
that I am going to drive or ride in.  So far, about one in three has had
one or both pins missing.  It might be interesting to go around at a
show and see how many are missing - hopefully the enthusiast/owners at
a show would have taken care of stuff like that, but you never know...
