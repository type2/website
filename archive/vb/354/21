Hi Chris,
We have only seen that once when a friend bought a good used engine.   Turned 
out the DPO or rebuilder when installing the distributor drive, had one  of 
the washers underneath offset.  Instead of removing the drive shaft and  fixing 
the problem.  A hammer was used to pound the drive, which in  turn cut the 
washer and bent it so it occupied the same space in the bore that  the bottom of 
the drive sits into.  The bore casting itself was cracked due  to much 
stuffed into it!!
