Subject: Wanted: Bus Trailer for Sale or Rent

Volks,

I'm moving from Baltimore to Pittsburgh this weekend (~220 miles) and 
had planned on trailering my 1967 bus out there with me.

I just picked up the moving truck and found out that they weren't able 
to get me a trailer!

This puts me in a bit of a bind (esp. since I was planning on driving 
the bus to work on Monday and Tuesday).

Anybody in the Baltimore (Washington DC, Philly, Delaware) region have 
a car trailer they're looking to sell (or know of one).

Or does anyone know where I can rent one on short notice?

Thanks,

	Tom Tarka
