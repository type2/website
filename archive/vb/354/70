Ah, but Sandra can hold her own when it comes to working on
cars.  She's been thowing wrenches around since before she
and Mark even got together, if memory serves right!  (I
wasn't there - it's all heresay.)  It was just not a good
Saturday for anybody to be camping - pretty rough. 
Definitely enough to leave a bad taste in your mouth.

I just had to chime in here. Last weekend, my wife and I were in the driveway painting the chassis of our '52 Ford Pickup that we're restoring (the other money pit) and our new neighbor came over and said "I am so jealous!". We naturally thought he would then say how he loved the truck or wish he had time to work on his etc. Instead he said "I can't get my wife to help me with anything that has to do with my truck!" Cracked us up. Not only does she like working together on our mutual projects, but it's her truck! :)
