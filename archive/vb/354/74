When we did our Hwy 1 tour there were all kinds of buses parked on the
side of the road camped out. We just picked turnouts that were a
little wide to give us some distance from the road. I can't imagine
cops hassling with as many buses that were camped out along the road.

Is there a large CHP presense there that won't allow that or a mile marker that is a good spot? He's looking for more of a non-paying campground type area than a state park kind of area. Thanks.
