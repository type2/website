When I had my bus restored, I had ISP West install new elephant ears onto my
original posts. It took a only a little adapting. The original posts are
about a millimeter larger in diameter than the repros so they are a bit
stiffer and don't vibrate. The part that acts as the hinge pin is also
slightly larger on the originals so the door sags less on the upper hinge.

I also purchased some of those little stick on spherical mirrors and stuck
them into the lower outer corner for blind spot checkin'. Makes driving much
easier and more secure. You just never miss officer Opi hiding in your rear
corner.
