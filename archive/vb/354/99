You're welcome.  I wasn't the only person to mention it, though.  :)

Is this a flat braided strap?  How wide is it?  Most of the hood ground
straps I have seen on other cars are maybe 1/4" wide.  This is fine for
carrying the current (maybe 40 A) back to the generator, but might not
work so well for the large starter currents (200 A or more).  An
"official" tranny ground strap is around 3/4" or so wide, like the ground
strap from the battery.  It's probably equivalent to at least 6 or 8 AWG
wire.  Having _any_ wire there will help your grounding, but you might
melt a small wire with the starter one day.
