Nah...it thought it was funny...I was half expecting a full blown 
explanation on how you should remove the stub axles with 
the RGB's and tranny in place.  It's not like it hasn't happened

on this list long enough to know who will post this stuff and 
who will start flaming over it.

Unless I totally missed the point...
