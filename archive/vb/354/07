Subject: Doing the headlining

I've been waiting for a trim shop to fit me in now for a few months so I 
thought what the heck I'll have a go myself

Check out the "headlining job" link on  www.vwsamba.com

The job is coming on fine and I've saved a bunch of money too.  I've 
done most of the lower lining now so it's time to move on to the roof - 
damn those 23 windows... ;)
