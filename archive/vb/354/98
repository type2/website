Dear VintageBus,

A good many of you know about NEATO and our newsletter Old Bus Review (if
you dont, and are curious, let me know and Ill send you a free sample
newsletter). I edit NEATOs free email newsletter: OBR Lite. OBR Lite is
the electronic companion to NEATOs Old Bus Review newsletter. Its
completely different from the printed Old Bus Review. It is:

* An occasional email of short bits of info related to Split-Window VW
Busing;

* A collection of links to other websites with bus-relevant info & pictures;

* Short excerpts in PDF format of the printed Old Bus Review.

To subscribe to OBR Lite, simply send an email with the word subscribe in
the subject line to <mailto:obrlite(-at-)earthlink.net>obrlite(-at-)earthlink.net.
Your email address will be added to the database----then sit back and enjoy
the ride! Your email address will not be given out to advertisers,
spammers, or other evil-doers.

Membership in NEATO is not required to receive a free subscription to OBR
Lite.

Tom Brouillette
