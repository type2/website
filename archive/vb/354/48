Since I sent out this comment to everyone publicly, I wanted to
publicly appologize to Karl for sending it out to everyone. I am not
the playground police on what should and shouldn't be said. I stand by
my comment, but a simple private message would have sufficed. I
appologize to Karl for acting this way, and taking the list down to a
path that should not have been traveled.
