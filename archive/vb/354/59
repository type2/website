Does anyone have any good knowledge of obtaining a rear bumper for '66 Bus. I
found a 1973 bumper in the U-Pick-Parts in Sun Valley, CA., but I don't know
if it will fit. Who else carries these, besides buying a brand new one. Some
come with guards, but what is the difference of getting the blade only.
