I'm not naive enough to claim this will always work, but I have found
a little bit of carbon can go a long way.  No, not the stuff you scraped
out of the heat riser tube!  Unfortunately, the correlation between the
amount of time you had her lie under the Bus to help you work on it and
proper amount of carbon to compensate for it has to be determined by
experiment...
