I'll second that.  When I towed my Bus from Houston to Tulsa on a U-Haul
flatbed, one of the straps kept coming loose.  The strap on the other
wheel, the chain on the front, and IIRC the chain in the back kept
anything drastic from happening, but I had to cinch up that one strap at
about every fuel stop.

I also remember that the ratchet for the other wheel strap was cranky
and didn't want to turn.  The next time I rent a car trailer, I am going
to make sure I have a small hammer, some Vice-Grips, and a can of WD-40
handy.
