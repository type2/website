Josh et al,
I was thinking of proposing somthing similar, as I live near GA, and I was 
going to contact a friend about a GA registration for a 71 save I'm doing.  
GA will just issure a registration, and SC will balk at that, but eventually 
caves in and issues a real live title.  That may be helpful.  I'll probably 
do the Titles Unlimited/Broadway thing for the 71, byt I may try to enlist 
your aid, Josh, in a parts/reciprocity deal.  IOW, if the East Coast can 
help, let us know.
