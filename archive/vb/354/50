Subject: Engine problems. fuel pump MTBF

Hi,

Got my bus back yesterday via AAA flatbed. Pushed it into the garage. There
it sits lonely hearted and cannot even f**t. Soon I will remove the engine
for rebuild. Hope the dizzy works out better next time. The brass drive gear
it seems is shot. Lots of brass in the oil. Engine won't even start. Need a
new alternator anyway and this is a good opportunity to install one. After
25+ years, a replacement regulator, regreased bearings and 150k+ miles it is
tired.

The upside? I am still running the original fuel pump from the 1500, only
300k miles. How much longer will it last? Any guesses? Bets?

:(

Chris
