sell it "as is" let them work it out, if it is that sweet you could find
another buyer.  or hold it for the kid to pay for it himself, by then he
will be closer to 16

the old phrase  "SEP"   somebody elses problem.   I would not get involved
in any thing like that, especially if the kid doesn't know. he has
seen/heard it run. if he is that smart he will "know" if it is sabatoged

my opinion,, this is between mother and son,  look for another buyer this
is trouble.
