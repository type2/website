Hi Gloria,
You need a bumper from a 1966-67 bus.  Commonly referred to as a  "pointy 
ends" bumper.  The 1968-72ish looks the same, BUT the brackets  inside these 
bumpers are welded in such a way if bolted onto an earlier bus  makes the bumper 
tilt downward toward the front too much.  Look for VW swap  meets nearest you 
and enjoy the hunt!!
