Ah, but Sandra can hold her own when it comes to working on
cars.  She's been thowing wrenches around since before she
and Mark even got together, if memory serves right!  (I
wasn't there - it's all heresay.)  It was just not a good
Saturday for anybody to be camping - pretty rough. 
Definitely enough to leave a bad taste in your mouth.
