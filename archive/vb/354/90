Subject: RE: Chassis to tranny ground strap.

Thanks Matt!  I dug around in my box of wire and found a ground wire from
the hood to chassis of one of my past Sciroccos, had to drill out one end of
the brass end so that the tranny mount bolt would fit thru it, presto.  This
morning, no dimly glowing gen light and wow, the headlights looked like
halogens!
Thanks again,
