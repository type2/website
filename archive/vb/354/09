Hi,

Just parked and engine still warm:  possibly a manx baja, talked to owner
who could not find a manufacterer's tag, 1600 engine with about 700 miles,
$3500 asking, call 310-316-5719. This is not my vehicle. I know nothingk!!!

Bus content:  The engine on my bus is running badly at only 250 miles and
the builder is looking into it. Dizzy advance is jumping all over the place.
Have an 009. The dizzy has been opened and nothing was found to be wrong
with it. I suspect the drive gear. Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Chris
