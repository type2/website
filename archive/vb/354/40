Hi Jason,
The repro Elephant ears type mirrors vibrate too much at highway  speeds.  
Causing the view in them to turn into a blur.  
  We have used the small round mirrors in our panel and turn the  interior 
mirror so the driver looks into it and out the passenger slider window  to 
reduce the right side blind spot down to nearly nothing.  Also keep  side mirrors 
angled outward just a bit to get more of the blind  spots and to look straight 
back must lean slightly.
  Trying Harp mirrors on now and they have the solidness of the small  round 
mirrors, but a bit more bigger.
