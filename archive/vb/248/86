Subject: sticker makers?

Friday!

I ordered one of the sundial camper logo stickers from my cafe press website 
and they are ok, but not worth the 3 bucks to make ea.  I would like to get 
several of these made as that is what most ppl are buying and offer them for 
a much smaller price.  Anyone know a source for sticker work?

Here is what it looks like on my bus (NOTE: I cut it down a little as cafe 
press leaves quite a border)

I also renewed www.sundial-camper.com for another 2 years and will prob be 
bringing the site back up soon.
