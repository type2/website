I thought most cars with carbs and automatic chokes needed at least one
good pump before cranking.  It sets the choke and dumps in a little gas
from the accelerator pump to kick things off.  The VWs I've driven are
like this, and my Dad's '79 (-at-)ldsm(-at-)bil(-at-) was like that.  Before you touched
the key, if you gave the (-at-)lds one hit in the summer or three in the winter,
it would fire right up.
