It would just become a restriction. Even at idle, the stock fan is pumping
out some good air. Besides, most electric fans are high volume/low pressure.
You need pressure for the cooling system to force air past all the cooling
fins. 900 cfm won't do any good if it cant push it where it needs to go.
Plus, if you have a problem overheating while idling, something is definitly
wrong.  :-)
