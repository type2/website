Subject: I scored a '63 double cab

Hi,

This is my first post on this list. I'm mostly a late model Westy bus guy but 
couldn't pass up a chance to own a double(or the '65 buggy I bought last 
month).  When and if my budget ever recovers, I'd like to buy the canvas cover for 
the back. I have the frame.  Who offers the canvas?

Thanks,
Jacques
