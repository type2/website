Subject: 58-61 tail light markings

i met a guy locally that has some nos 58-61 tail light lenses but i noticed
that some have different markings than the others.  one style just says
"Hella"  in the center and underneath says "SRBL17" or something like that.
the set i bought from him has "hella" in the center and underneath has a
squiggly line followed by k13280.  around the bottom it says "bs2515 grade 2".
both types had the gold paint on the back of the lenses.  can somebody fill me
in on the difference?  thanks!
