I second incynr8's suggestion of checking for vacuum leaks.  These lean
out your mixture and make your engine die.

Did you adjust the choke?  Let the Bus sit all night, not running.  In
the morning, go out and take the air cleaner connection off and loosen
up the screws that hold the choke housing down.  With one hand, grab
the throttle lever and pull it back so it's not touching the fast idle
cam.  With the other, grab the choke housing and rotate it - one way
will open the choke and the other way will close it.  Put it to where
it just barely closes, and then maybe a touch more, and tighten down
the screws.  Put everything else back together.

To start, hit the gas pedal once to set the choke and pump in a little
gas, and twist the key.  The engine should start and run at a high idle,
then come down to normal idle as the choke comes off.  Sometimes it
won't come down until you tap the throttle a bit to free up the fast
idle cam momentarily, but it should come down eventually.
