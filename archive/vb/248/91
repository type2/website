Subject: RE: [VB] emergency brake problem

I understand that now...I had only planned on going away for about 4
days-and ended up going for a couple weeks. I have never gotten into the
habit of putting the bus in gear when I park it. I am going to try to do
that...another reason-the last squareback that I owned had it's front end
smashed in when the previous owner neglected his emergency brake, and had
the car roll down the hill.

quick question on greasing the adjusting stars-what do you use for grease-do
you use a bearing type of grease or a lubricant type stuff(like wd-40)?
