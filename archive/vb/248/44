Subject: RE: [VB] bus (still) does not idle

Hmmm, sounds like the problems I tend to have.
Check idle circuit for clogging, jet for looseness. Check jets for too big
main or incorret idle jet.
Check fuel pressure. 3-3.5psi should be good.
Check point seating and dwell.
Check plugs, fouled, gap, tight, etc.
Check for Vac leaks (especially around those DP boots and intake manifolds)
this is #1.

Hopefully someone who has better luck solving problems chimes in.



I spent the last few days removing the carb, cleaning it, putting it back
on, I even replaced the fuel lines ( they were old and nasty) The timing is
correct. The fuel cut-off is working.  Any ideas of where to look next?  the
bus starts and runs as long as you keep your foot on the pedal.  As soon as
you take it off, the bus winds down like you shut the key off
