Subject: Re: [VB] bus (still) does not idle

i had a similar problem last week (2 weeks ago maybe), i had an idling 
issue, my carb was really dirty so i figured it needed cleaning. i rebuilt 
it put it back on and it ran ok for a day, then the idling issue came 
back, but worse. i started checking all kinds of stuff, like timing, 
etc...and was thinking i needed to switch out the carb, or at least 
re-rebuild it and take my time looking for mistakes. then while talking to 
a friend of mine it occured to me that i should give a go at adjusting it 
again, to double check all that. anyway to make a short point long, it 
ended up that when i was adjusting things, i found that the idle screw (on 
a 34pict3, the long one on the lever) had backed itself out, so after 
adjusting it, it ran fine. 

sorry i can't really help, but i thought it may be worth saying to double 
check the simple things first, as that's usually where it's at. i hope the 
problem surfaces for you soon, i feel your pain.

later,
matthew
