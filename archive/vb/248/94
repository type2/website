Since the early eighties I have been rebuilding 34's because they all of a
sudden had become orphans. The German 34's were of real good quality and
lasted a long time before needing a rebuild, but the Brosol carbs gave them a
bad name. They seem to be made of a real poor grade aluminum, almost pot
metal. Being of poor quality they were subject to vacuum leaks from poorly
mated surfaces and throttle shaft wear requiring bushings. The float bowl area
is another bad place for the Brosols. The cast surfaces should really be
machined to fit. I end up taking the 440 grit wet/dry sand paper to them on a
flat surface to make sure they are flat. Also the choke shaft sometimes has a
problem binding. Over the years I discovered that if I picked up a box or two
of orphaned carbs and then took the time to rebuild them I would come up with
reliable carbs that I could depend on.

I've read/heard that one of the issues w/ the 34 is they seem to get
clogged up sometimes. All the sudden my 1600 wouldn't idle good at
all. I suspect a piece of trash or something of the like clogging up
something somewhere. It runs very strong apart from the idle with no
hesitation. All I had time to check was the timing & dwell. I'll
double-check the valves since I adjusted them the day before.

So anyway my question actually is, have people had this experience on
the 34s where it suddenly wouldn't idle well, or was it a progressive
decrease in performance? If need be I'll pull the carb & clean it as
well as a few more checks, but was wondering what others experience
was w/ this. Also it could be bad gas, so I might just run it keep an
eye on temps, etc & clean it at Natural bus if needed :)
