Subject: Wiper arm length?

I'm wondering if the wiper arms are the right length on my 65 standard.  The wipers only clear the bottom 2/3 of the windshields, and I'm a tall guy.  
But longer blades would be too long on the bottom unless the mount were offset.  Maybe I have Beetle arms?

[brief mental picture of guy with black, hooky, chitinous arms]

A PO converted this beast to 12v, but while I forget the details of late-splitty wiper variations, IIRC mine has the correct skinny posts that the arms 
clamp to with a little pinch bolt.

Can someone with "correct arms" give me a measurement of overall length?  Precision's not important; I'm just trying to figure out if mine are too short.  
Rain-X lets me see during the rain, but I want to be able to wipe the beads off every now and then.  And my neck's getting sore.
