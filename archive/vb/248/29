Subject: Burger Meet...

You mean you all didn't know exactly where I was talking about  ; ) .
The Burger Meet is in Seattle, WA. I had a few people e-mail me and let
me know that the world does not revolve around me and I should let them
know what part of I-5 this was on. To them I say the world does revolve
around me but I live in the Gorge and this is Seattle so none of this
applies.

Sorry about not being more specific,
Craig
