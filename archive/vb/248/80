Subject: Re: [VB] scoops are cooler-electric fan q

Speaking of electrics, has anyone tried an electric fan blowing INTO the
fan shroud opening to feed the generator fan? I'm thinking this would be
good in the traffic jams, and help block debris coming in. I believe the
engine bay and vents are sufficent stock, but force feeding the engine
in that environment might be good, although increased/proper stock fan
speed might be all it really needs.
