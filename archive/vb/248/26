Subject: Burger Meet...

The Burger Meet is held at the University Village Burgermaster. They
have great greasy burgers and a chocolate malt that, when ordered with
x-tra malt, actually crunches. To get there take I-5 north to the NE
45th st. Exit (or I-5 south if you are coming from the north). Head east
on 45th until you drop down the hill and over a viaduct. At the bottom
will be a light. Head east for just a short ways more and you will see a
Safeway on your left and the Burgermaster is the next driveway up.
Sometimes it is a little easier to duck into one of the Safeway
driveways and then come around the back entrance to the Burgermaster.

The Burger meet is the best show of the year in my opinion. No one is
swapping anything and no one is all hung up detailing their cars.
Everyone is just hanging out and talking car stuff. Very cool and very
casual. Not to mention those malts.
