Ever had one of those nights when something comes to
fruitition and transcends your expectations?
Well, last night was that for me.
I've been working on my friends 63 SC for more than 6
weeks now, just basically when the pair of us could
get together.
One Sunday about 3 weeks ago we managed to pull a 36
from his '58 Beetle, drop it in my truck, take it to
my place about 80kms away and put it into the SC.
This may seem pedestrian for most of you guys but it's
more than either of us have ever managed before.
We'd played with 3 different possible replacements
before that with little success for reasons varying
from bad compression and lots of filth to entire
rocker gear and a push rod being short on one engine.
Anyhow, we connected everything up, or so we thought,
that sunday but no dice.
Last night another mate came over(an experiences VW
mechanic), fixed the problem in about half an hour(a
missing wire to the coil and a blocked fuel line) and
the 36hp roared into life.
To begin with I didn't listen much....I was just
relieved it was firing.
Then my friend says "Wanna try it out?"
So I took it out onto the laneway behind my house &
got it up and going.
I've never actually driven a Split....I have owned 2
running Bays but my Split is immobile so far.
The purr that engine made was EXQUISITE!!!
I'm totally ruined....
I have to have a stock split now.
The one I'm restoring isn't stock & won't ever be
again even though the mods are
basic(balljoint,IRS,etc.).
The standard exhaust and behaviour of the 36hp was
amazing.
We were revving the ringer out of it and it was fine.
Of course as we drove it a little more we found that
the clutch is actually stuffed and that there's a leak
from the rear main that we think is rather terminal
but it'll do for the moment.
And then of course there's the dodgy brake light
switch and the numerous rust holes.
But enough gushing.
Who ever thought an underpowered standard engine could
be such bliss?
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
