Ever have one of those days where you come home with stuff you 
totally didn't need...but always really wanted.....

Today I traded VW parts for this killer '61 Double Door Panel. It's 
complete down to the original wheels. Cut wheel wells and cab 
divider. Needs front turn signal lenses and correct rear taillights. 
Everything else is sweet! Probably the best bus I've brought home 
ever. Has an engine that isn't locked....havn't had the chance to see 
what's up with it yet. Zero rust. Killer killer bus. Oh yeah, the 
lower hinge on the passenger cab door is messed up. The bus needs 
lots of cleaning. But it's mine! I'm very happy. Here's some pictures 
of it from when I originally saw it in person....

Now, it doesn't stop there. A few years ago I found a '61 Double Cab 
for sale. I talked my friend into buying it as "I didn't need another 
bus...please buy it so I won't!". He's had it for a few years now and 
hasn't done anything with it except collect some parts. I kept 
telling him if he got it running he'd sell it. Today when I went to 
his shop he took me for a ride in it! He had put a nice running 40HP 
engine in it. The tranny boots were replaced and the gear oil 
changed. All the brake parts were replaced...rubber lines, cylinders, 
shoes, ect.  This thing was alive and it sounded good. His plan was 
to take it to the bug-in on Sunday. After talking to him a bit, I 
ended up BUYING the truck! I spent more money on this VW bus than I 
have ever spent on one. I don't want to get specific, but I spent 
over $1000 and under $1500. The underneath of the truck has been gone 
through. All the mechanicals are rockin' good man. It's just an ugly 
body on the thing. It needs bodywork and paint BAD. But I got a good 
cargo door, cab doors, rear apron, rear bumper, taillights, turn 
signals, headlights, emblem, interior stuff....on and on. everything 
to put it together the rest of the way. I figure what I'll do is 
throw that stuff on, get it street legal and use it as my daily 
driver. That'll get me back in a bus again. I don't know if I'm gonna 
leave it ugly as is....paint it ALL primer gray paint....or Rat Rod 
it and paint it flat black with red wheels and white wall tires. But 
I don't want to do anything that will take more than a weekend of 
work. Just don't want to do it at all. It's gonna be a driver and 
that's that. I might be in the market for some Safari windows if 
someone has an old crusty Bus Boys set they'd want to sell or 
something. Anyway, here's pictures of it. These are from 2 years ago, 
but it's more or less the same...just filled up with all the extra 
parts now. And it's got a full set of '15 Bus wheels now too.
