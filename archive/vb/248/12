Subject: Re: [VB] Side Window Inner Rubber Seal

I had less than an inch "extra" and glued them into place. They went in
fine. Be sure that you have the right ones, though there shouldn't be much
of a question about that. If they are too long regardless, then send them
back. Mine were WCM, and I did the work back in 95. Donno how they are
now.

I could bus out an xacto and cut the rubber but that seems jus
t stoopid- mebbe I am missing something obvious. As well does
 anyone know if these seals were originally glued in place or
 was it just a pressure fit?
