Subject: spark plug

I have just finished rebuilding my engine and on a drive the spark plug blow
out.  Unfortunately, it turns out that thread for the spark plug on the head
is worn out and a coil to hold in the spark pulg has already been used. Any
suggestions on a quick fix. Otherwise I'll have to pull out the engine and
replace the head.
