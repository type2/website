Subject: Buses Of the Corn 2003

Hi Volks,

There are now just 9 weeks to go before Buses Of The Corn in Whitby, 
Ontario Canada.  BOTC 2003 will be held August 8th-10th.

This year will be the third Buses Of the Corn, and things are shaping 
up to be every bit as good as last year's event. Even better, actually 
-- www.GermanSupply.com has stepped in to subsidize the camping fees 
and helped us get the price of a VWonderful event down to just $8Cdn 
(slightly over $US5) for the whole weekend! This includes camping fees 
for Friday and Saturday and the corn for the pot-luck cornroast on 
Saturday night.

Please email and let me know if you're planning on attending so I have 
an idea how many to expect.


History Lesson:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
In 2001 BOTC was just a place to hangout during the weekend of the 
Great Canadian Bug Show. In 2002 the GCBS changed to a one-day event 
and we scaled up BOTC to offer Saturday activities like the VW Camping 
Competition, Frisbee Golf and the Driving Skillz Challenge. These 
turned out to be a great success and we're definitely going to be 
bringing them back this year. Our long-distance award last year went to 
a split-window from New Hampshire, and others travelled from as far as 
West Virginia and Michigan to attend. Last year we had 40 buses, up 
from 15 in 2001.


Geography Lesson:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Heber Down Conservation Area is located just North of Whitby,  about 25 
miles east of Toronto, Ontario. The camping facilities at BOTC is 
somewhat... rustic. We prefer this campground because it is close to 
Toronto, affordable and pretty private. Being at the end of a 3/4 mile 
gravel road we just don't get a lot of drive-through gawkers. (although 
a few of the hikers using the trails nearby have been known to stare at 
all the funny looking campers sometimes.)  There are two large 
permanent picnic shelters and and plenty of non-flush toilets. Coin-op 
showers are available, and there is running water. There is a VERY 
limited amount of electricity so please don't count on having a hookup. 
If you need one for medical reasons please inquire off-list and we will 
make sure that it can be accounted for. Pets must be kept on a leash at 
all times. "Red Cup Policy" applies as usual, so be cool.

The weather in early August should be just about perfect in Southern 
Ontario. 80-degree days, and 60-70 degree nights are typical. It hardly 
ever rains. (Ha!) The campground is in a rural setting and well away 
from smelly livestock, urban pollution and noisy transportation 
corridors.


BOTC Events:
~~~~~~~~~~~

Tie Dye Workshop: Friday Night & Saturday Morning
For 2003 we are introducing a new event... we will be having a Tie-Dye 
Workshop on Friday night and Saturday morning. Skilled instructors will 
be available to help you create your own psychedelic masterpiece, so 
bring your own items to color or buy a shirt from us on-site.  Blank  
T-shirts will be available cheap at the event in a variety of sizes. In 
addition to the Tie-Dye, we will also have a simple screen-printing rig 
set up to add a BOTC event logo to people's shirts if they would like 
it. Details on this event will be going on the website soon. There will 
be no mail-order shirts this year, so you'll just have to come and make 
your own!

If you are interested in the Tie-Dye Workshop please let me know 
beforehand so we can bring in enough supplies.

Full Moon Bus Club Breakfast Burritos
This is a wonderful, co-operative event invented by the  Full Moon Bus 
Club  in the Carolina Mountains. Those folks really know how to get 
together and have a good time in their buses. How does it work? Glad 
you asked! ...All you have to do is bring along an ingredient! Bring 
enough to feed your group, plus maybe a wee bit extra. See our website 
for the ingredient list, and e-mail me so I'll know what you're 
bringing. http://www.pottsfamily.ca/VW_type2/BOTC/Burrito.html

Bus Camping Competition: Saturday Morning
This one is as fun to watch as it is to compete in: From a moving 
start, contestants stop their bus, set up for bedtime, and put head to 
pillow. Then set up a for a meal, and consume one mouthful of a food 
item. Next it's relax mode, and time to sit back and relax on a beach 
chair. Finally, contestants pack up and get back in the bus, and the 
clock stops as soon as the wheels turn. Extra points may be awarded for 
style, and penalty points are deducted for sloppiness. Last year's 
fastest uncorrected time was 47 seconds! Teams or single contestants 
may compete.

Driving Skillz Competition: Saturday Afternoon
This will involve a slalom course, followed by a test to see how close 
one can park to a pole without actually hitting it. Then you do it 
again, back the way you came... IN REVERSE, and you have to back up to 
the marker this time. Once the slalom and parking tests are completed 
there is a parallel parking test and points are tallied based on a 
composite score on all 5 components. This event was a real 
crowd-pleaser last year. Licensed drivers only, please.

Frisbee Golf: All weekend
The meadow adjacent to the camping area is a perfect site for a 
9-basket frisbee golf course, so be sure to bring your favorite flying 
disk and play a round. We'll have a spare or two available if you don't 
already own one.

Kids Scavenger Hunt.
Just as the day afternoon is getting long and the kids are getting 
bored, that is when we distribute the award-winning BOTC scavenger hunt 
lists. In teams or singles, no-one has ever come back with more than 
half of the many items that are on the list. But everything on the list 
is in the park somewhere...

Pot-Luck Dinner & Awards
BOTC provides the corn, but it helps if campers can also bring along a 
side dish or dessert. If your last name starts with a letter from A-O, 
bring a side dish. If it's P-Z, bring a dessert. After dinner is 
cleared away we'll award the Event Winners and distribute the door 
prizes.


Volunteers to help out and Door prize donations are welcome. No 
previous experience required. Please e-mail off-list if you would like 
to help out.
