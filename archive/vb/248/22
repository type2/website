Subject: Re: [T2] Tail lights?

Hiya Bryan,

I cannot speak for Indian manufacture, but I have purchased taillight 
housings and lenses separately from sources in Brazil.  I decided that I'd like to go 
with the European (amber over red lens with a two bulb housing) look in my 70 
Bus.  I figured more light - more safety.  So, here's what you may be getting 
from the third world.......

The housings were pretty rough from a workmanship point of view.  But much to 
their credit, two years later I have had no problem whatsoever with them and 
they still look like new.  The lenses (which are no longer available from 
Brazil - now they are selling a real cheapo amber lense with a painted red bottom) 
were also of pretty decent manufacture.  The chrome lense ring was one of the 
cheapest VW related parts I've ever seen.  The "chrome" was flaking off 
inside of two months.  I had those rechromed and everything is hunky-dory now.
