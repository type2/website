Subject: Re: [VB] bus (still) does not idle

It really does sound like a carb issue.   do you have another carb you could 
put on it?

Or swap the one you have onto another VW to see if it gives the other VW the 
same problem?

I haven't heard of the 30/31 having cleaning out issues (like the 34s do), 
but maybe this one does for some reason.  I mean, on the 34s I've cleaned them 
out and still had the idling issue.  Heard there is a hidden passage somewhere, 
but haven't cleaned one out since I heard that, and forget where the secret 
passage is.

 bus starts and runs as long as you keep your foot on the pedal.  As soon as
 you take it off, the bus winds down like you shut the key off.   The engine

 I give up and take it to the mechanic (I don't really want to.) >>
