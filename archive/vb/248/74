Subject: Re: [VB] emergency brake problem

If you let the bus sit a while with the ebrake on, the shoes will rust to the 
drums.  So if your bus is broken and just sitting, do not leave the ebrake on 
or it'll be a big PITA.  Like buying a bus that sat in a field with the 
ebrake on for ten years.   ACK!!!!!!!!!!!  For those situations, take an axe or 
maul with you, and whack the drums.  You can whack the face, or remove the wheel 
and whack the outside .   you can hear the tone change when the shoes break 
free.

If you drive the bus regularly this is not an issue.

If your brakes feel soft, go for the adjust and bleed routine.

It never hurts to pull the drums and give the brakes a look over, peel back 
the dust covers on the cylinders to check for oozes, grease the adjustment 
stars, check the front wheel bearings.  when I do my brakes, I grease where metal 
rubs on metal.  Older ebrake cables have places to grease them (very cool.) 
Your brake system probably should be inspected every year or every 30K or 
whatever. 

Driving round town will get rid of any rust on the inside of the drums.  
Normal amounts that is.

here in the PNW sometimes I feel that sticking sensation went the brakes rust 
to the drums and I fight it loose.  Even in the morning after driving the bus 
home the day before.   In damp weather.

<< ust made it cross country in my new 1971 squareback...as nice as it is, I
 missed my bus. Upon returning I tried to take my bus for a ride the next
 day(today). It had sat for about 10 days, in wet raining weather. When I
 went to release the emergency brake-it wsa very stiff, as though it were not
 really releasing. And my brakes feel really soft...so I didn't drive very
 far, basically about 5 feet, then back into the parking spot.
