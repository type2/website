John,

First and foremost, go here http://www.autobodystore.com

Look around and by all means read the BBS section and then post your
question to it.  You WILL get an appropriate and correct answer of what
to do and how to do it. 

In short though, typically runs are cut dow with a nib file or shaver. 
Then they are sanded out with progressively finer grades of paper then
compounded with progressively finer grades of compound and then sealed
and then waxed.

Keep in mind that since you used Acrylic Enamel you WILL NEED TO LET IT
DRY!  This can take from a few weeks to a few months.  Unlike two part
catalyzed paints, acrylic enamel dries by evaporation, and needs to
FULLY cure before you start any sanding/buffing.

Good luck.

Steve
