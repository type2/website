Subject: idle issue w/ 34 Pict-3

I've read/heard that one of the issues w/ the 34 is they seem to get
clogged up sometimes. All the sudden my 1600 wouldn't idle good at
all. I suspect a piece of trash or something of the like clogging up
something somewhere. It runs very strong apart from the idle with no
hesitation. All I had time to check was the timing & dwell. I'll
double-check the valves since I adjusted them the day before.

So anyway my question actually is, have people had this experience on
the 34s where it suddenly wouldn't idle well, or was it a progressive
decrease in performance? If need be I'll pull the carb & clean it as
well as a few more checks, but was wondering what others experience
was w/ this. Also it could be bad gas, so I might just run it keep an
eye on temps, etc & clean it at Natural bus if needed :)
