 How fast to you have be going to get the cooling effect? Obviously, you get
 zero or a negative effect when you are sitting in traffic idling on a 90+
 degree day.

I only took readings in 3rd and 4th gears.   It is kinda a PITA to take 
readings, as the set up was sort of complicated, and the lap top computers 
batteries only lasted so long.   I took driveway readings w/ scoops on, but not w/o 
scoops on.

In all speeds in 3rd and 4th (25 to 55 in 3rd, 40 to 70 in 4th) it ran cooler 
w/ scoops.

as overheating does not tend to be an issue putting around town, I felt it 
was okay to ignore the lower speeds.

An odd thing was that at ALL speeds in 4th scoops lowered the temps by the 
same amount (10C), but in 3rd the temp drop varied inversely with speed.

I thought this bus was fairly normal,  so I didn't test the 65 with 3.88 FF 
tranny and small gen pulley.   If I had had more time (or less other things I 
had to do) I would have tested more things.

 Your actual experience may vary from mine.
