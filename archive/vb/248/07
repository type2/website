Hi Greg,
That is not good!  Best guess is your oil cooler has a leak or the seals to 
it.  Remove cooler, have cooler pressure checked and cleaned, and replace oil 
cooler seals.  As for getting it so hot, more than likely you have damaged some 
of the main/rod bearings.

Was the bus on flat ground?  If the nose was uphill the oil would be tipped 
to the rear inside the sump.  Never bother to check oil till at least ten 
minutes after running and we prefer 15 minutes so as to insure the oil in the 
cooler and passages has drained completely.

It is not going to do that!

Remove the rest of the engine tin and heater boxes, down to a long block and 
retorque all the case and then head fasteners!  Because it over heated these 
need to be retoqued and who knows when it was retorqued last.

Sounds like you have the rod for the thermostic flaps in the wrong hole or 
jammed.  Also check that the curved arm that hold the top of this rod has a 
popsicle stick width of space between it and the flap it is riveted to.

Just leave it!  It is a fuel injection sensor.
