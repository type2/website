Subject: brosol 30/31 adjustment ?'s

The little screw controls the air/fuel mix. It is called the
"mixture" adjustment. I'm not certain exactly what the
larger screw is doing but it adjusts the idle speed. It is
called the "volume" adjustment.
Three full turns out on each of these screws is a good
initial setting. Be sure not to tighten down too hard on the
mixture screw or you will damage the important pointed tip.
Back off the mixture screw until you get the highest idle.
Then close it back down a quarter turn. If adjustment takes
you more than a few turns away from the initial three turn
setting then something is probably amiss with your carb. If
the mixture adjustment screw has little to no effect it is
probably crudded up and needs cleaning before you can adjust
the carb.
Now the mixture screw is at the right place, bring the idle
back to the right range with the volume screw. Now repeat
the whole process a couple times to be sure you're there.
End of fact, beginning of opinion:
I think the Brosol 30/31 is a fine carb, but I feel that the
120 mains it comes with is too big. I switched down to a 115
mains(1600 single port) over a year ago and found my oil
stays cleaner. Bus copes with 100 degree days and mountains
just fine, thankyou.
