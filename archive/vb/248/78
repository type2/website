Hi Karl, good info - I didn't realise that - they looked the same so I assumed
they would be the same!

Haven't got the 67 doors here with me, but have the catches - my bus is a 66.
The screw holes for the catches look to be in the same place dimensionally -
can you see any reason why I couldn't modify the 67 doors to fit the 66
catches when I weld up the couple of holes that are in the bottom?

Paul
