You might want to put it in gear _and_ block one of the wheels.  I once
managed to leave my Bus in my driveway with the emergency brake off and
out of gear.  I went for parts and a burger in another car and came back
to find my Bus rather closer to the street than I left it.  It rolled
back about 20 feet and stopped on its own; my neighbor across the street
was working on his RV, noticed it, and came over and stuck a chunk of
4x4 under the back tire.

I use high temperature wheel bearing grease on the threads.  I don't
think there should be any on the stars themselves.  WD-40 is a solvent,
not a lubricant - it'll help loosen up the stars if they're rusty, but
then you should clean them up and put grease on them.
