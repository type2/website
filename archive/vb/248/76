Subject: Re: [VB] bus (still) does not idle - update

The choke is adjusted and working properly.  The bus still does not idle.
Checked for vac leaks around the boots, carb base.  I could not get to the
manifold area where it bolts to the heads.  I will see If I can pick up a
spare carb at bugfair next weekend.
