Subject: Re: [VB] RGB Gunk, brake backing plate

Ya when you pull that seal holder thing in the center off, gear oil will fall 
out.   The gl-4 I've found is staylube.   I use staylube 90 weight gl-4 gear 
oil in the gallon jug..    
Like veewee111 said, might as well drain the whole habitrail (tranny & 
gearboxez) and after you're done putting new seals and stuff on refill w/ new seals 
at the stub axles.    Unless you recently changed the oil and it's all clean, 
that is

When removing the backing plates

out of here. I am assuming this is just gear oil from
the RGB, but I want to know how to deal with it before
I take the thing off of the good bus.  So, can I just
replace any fluid that runs out in the process at the
fill plug on top of the RGB. Do I use generic 90
weight gear oil in there or something else?
This is the first time I have dinked with the RGB's so
i am really pretty clueless.
