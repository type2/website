Hi Andrew,

  I used to be a rural post office worker, had a rhd jeep, didn't like it
for anything but delivering mail.  It wasn't my favorite way of getting
around regularly is what I mean.  It would be different if I lived in the
land of Left side driving.  I understand why they put the driving wheel on
which side for which way of driving.  Maybe it I'm overlooking something?

Best,
joe
