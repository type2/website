I'm not the resident expert, but I know lots of people with 67's,
including me, and they all have elephant ears.

Hello Everyone,

I have a 67 standard bus. I need to replace the side view mirrors. Which
ones are correct? Some list the "elephant ear" as correct, while others
list the smaller round ones as correct. Thanks for the advice!
