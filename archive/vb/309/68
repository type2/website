...oooh.  Good thought.  Maybe the sound I heard was just the TOB falling
off (since without the cable on, the TOB would have been pulled /much/
further back...).  That would surely explain the clunking sounds..

We'll see what we get when I get around to taking the engine out.  I'd
been planing a trip back to savannah to get my /tools/ (and aircompressor,
and '79 rabbit..) though.  Gonna have to do that without the bus, I
suppose..

sigh.

We get'm.  You should get'm too, though.  AOL claims to be receiving
them...though they recently made some changes with their filtering systems
that tosses some list mail into some variety of junk or spam folder.  You
may want to check around to see if you can find where the AOL client is
putting the mail.
