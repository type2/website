Hello Guys    The biggest reason for broken crosshaft arms is the TOB falling 
off. What we do is to use the super clips that have a circle on the outside 
and use wire tyes to attach them to the crosshaft,   Also Talking about the VB 
list I don,t ever see any of my posts so I really don't have any idea if 
everybody gets them or not  Later and have fun  mark Dearing
