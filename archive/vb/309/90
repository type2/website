You can use a 31 to 34 PICT adapter plate reversed to fit the single
port manifold and the 34 PICT-3.

Also, is a 34PICT3 a straight swap onto a single port
manifold?
I have a set of 1300cc head machined out to fit 85.5mm
barrels to tweak up the compression.
They're a bit mucky but may be salvagable for a
run-about engine.
As I already have the 34PICT3 it may as well go to
good use.
