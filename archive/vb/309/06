Subject: PLAN B: Revisions to First Annual True Canadian Winter Bus

Hi Volks,

I've spent the last few days researching ice conditions and access 
points, and it turns out that there is too much snow on top of the ice 
to get out there in a bus.

Welcome to Plan B.

Valens Conservation Area in Cambridge Ontario has serviced campsites 
and offers ice-fishing and Cross-Country skiing. The park is about 35 
minutes east of Toronto and less than two hours from the US Border. 
Saturday Feb 28th to Sunday Feb 29th.

I called Valens Conservation Area in Cambridge (Ontario) this morning 
and talked to the Park Superintendent. They don't take reservations in 
winter, but he assured me that there would be LOTS of serviced sites 
available for us on the weekend of February 28th. The parks has heated 
washrooms, showers and laundry machines.  They also have ice fishing 
and cross country skiing available in the park.

I have updated the event info site at:
http://www.pottsfamily.ca/The_Bug_Pack/TCWBC/

You need to bring $7 in change to operate the gate in case it is 
unattended. Pay your way in, then find a campsite and set up. The park 
staff will eventually come around and register you, deducting the $7 
from your fees. Campsites cost only $25.50 CDN, and food should run 
about $10 or so. The event info site has the menu posted if you're 
interested.

If you're planning on coming please let me know. We're also working on 
T-shirts for the event,  if you're interested in one of those email 
Adam Narraway at Adoom(-at-)rogers.com.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
