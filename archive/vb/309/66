Subject: RE: [VB] windshield leak

Billy, the last window repair I saw was what I am going to do this
summer. He had already removed the glass and had started stripping the
paint when I saw him start. You could see everyplace where there were
pits and holes and several small lengths of actual rot out. He cleaned
up and removed all rusted areas over a period of a couple of months in
his garage and then broke out his torch and brazed up the larger areas
through slow build up and leaded in all of the pits. There were also
ridges and valleys along the window frame which he also leaded in. When
it was all ground smooth and primer and painted, it looked better than
factory and the seals haven't leaked at all this winter.

Clara, all,

When the DPO was "fixing" the windscreen ledges in my bus when he owned
it, he used some fiberglass shmoo that leaks and looks like ass from the
outside.

He was so damn proud of himself for that move, and the do-it-yourself
window tint he put all the way around.

I loved telling him about peeling it all off.

All that, and the lowering and crappy car tires and my bus was on the
fast train to hooptyville. Luckily I stepped in in time.

I'm wondering if I'll be able to get the fiberglass off when I go in
there.

Also, what about repair?  Is someone selling the metal bits, or will it
have to be a shop fab?

Took my kids to La Brea this summer. Totally awesome.

Billy
