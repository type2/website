Subject: 66-67 shift rod help!

Volks-

Thanks for the volks that have emailed questions.  Turns out I was not 
specific enough in my earlier plea for help.  The part that I need is 
the rear portion of the shift rod itself.  Mine somehow rotted in half.

Does anybody know if the 66-67 shift rod rear portion is unique, or 
will the rear portion from any old bus work?

It suppose if I really get desperate I could have one made, but I would 
probably still need and non-rusty one as a template.  Thanks in advance 
for any help.
