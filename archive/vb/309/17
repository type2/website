I think you had many options at the time.  

I think the little round ones look cute, but the elephant ears are more 
functional.   

I think the repro little round ones are bettr quality than the repro elephant 
ears.

The oval/rectangle mirrors that go on the harp/ D shaped mirror arms are more 
functional, better looking than the elephant ears, and of course rarer.

Hello Everyone,

I have a 67 standard bus. I need to replace the side view mirrors. Which
ones are correct? Some list the "elephant ear" as correct, while others list
the smaller round ones as correct.
Thanks for the advice!
