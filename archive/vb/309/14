Subject: Re: [VB] Proper side mirrors

Hello Guys    I have 3 buses two have round mirrors ,one elephant ears, I 
think that the ones that came to the USA had elephant ears except for the work 
buses( SC<DC<Panels) European buses came with the round mirrors. The elephant 
mirrors were M194 in the m codes so they must have just been a option. My all OE 
66 westy(Bubbles) was a tourist export from england and it had round mirrors. 
My other 66 westy was a USA reserve and had elaphant ears, These two buses 
were made 15 days apart from each other.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
