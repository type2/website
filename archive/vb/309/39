Subject: RGB Gunk, brake backing plate

Hey Y'all,
I am in the process of replacing brakes on my 67 bus.
I will likley replace backing plates and all from a
parts bus I have. When removing the backing plates
from the parts bus, the center square plate-type thing
that covers what appears to be some sort of bearing
part of the RGB(??), A bunch of fluid starting pouring
out of here. I am assuming this is just gear oil from
the RGB, but I want to know how to deal with it before
I take the thing off of the good bus.  So, can I just
replace any fluid that runs out in the process at the
fill plug on top of the RGB. Do I use generic 90
weight gear oil in there or something else?
This is the first time I have dinked with the RGB's so
i am really pretty clueless.
