I have 2 mates with dual Kadrons on their engines.
One is a blue-printed 1600 & the other is blue-printed
bay 2.0l.
The carbs are great & have been properly tuned by a VW
racing specialist who built the engines but they have
problems warming up, especially winter.
I live in Oz but the town we live in is about 2200ft
above sea level & is renowned for its temperate
summers & cold windy winters.
The guy with the 2.0l reckons he drives across town
riding the throttle as the thing coughs horribly just
to have it hum into a beatiful rhythm when he parks it
at work.
Anyone else have these probs?
Also, is a 34PICT3 a straight swap onto a single port
manifold?
I have a set of 1300cc head machined out to fit 85.5mm
barrels to tweak up the compression.
They're a bit mucky but may be salvagable for a
run-about engine.
As I already have the 34PICT3 it may as well go to
good use.
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
