Hi David,
If it is the TO arm make sure to buy one with a welded bead around the base 
of each arm, or weld it up that way.  We definitely have found the retaining 
springs with the full spring circle much better retaining, instead of the 
cheaper plain "U" shaped ones.  The oil pressure switch hsa a 1/8" NPT threaded hole.
