Subject: Re: [VB] re: windshield leak

Tempered windsheilds? I've never seen anything but laminated, both AS-1 and
AS-2 (aftermarket). Tempered windsheilds sound like a bad idea.

The glass I removed was tempered and laminated. I've installed both laminated
and tempered and the trick to laminated is not to apply direct pressure
anywhere. Slap the glass with an open palm very firmly but not hard, if that
makes sense. Spread the force out and use alot of windex when installing.
