Subject: Metal brake line length

I am a cheap S.O.B.! Therefore I hate paying shipping
costs on parts. Anyway, my FLAPS has metal brake lines
that are 20 inches long in stock.  I see from online
parts sources that rear metal lines on a 67 bus are
21.85" long.  So, my question is:  can I get a 20"
metal line to work or will that extra 1.85" be
problematic?
To order the right lines from internet source, it will
cost me more for shipping than it will for the parts,
and I just hate that ;^)
