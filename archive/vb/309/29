Hi Richard,
Can be done if you flip the differential ring gear to the other side if you 
are going to install RGBs.  If you are using the non-alpined geared 1959-63 
RGBs you will go from 47 MPH to about 42 MPH (-at-) 3,000 RPM, and if you use the 
earlier 1955-59 RGB gears you will even be lower geared!!  This will make you SC a 
real winner at pulling out stumps and plowing the back 40 acres, but not very 
drivable on the higher speed roads of Teeexxxaaasss.
