Subject: RE: [VB] Proper side mirrors

Round would be stock, but the 'elephant ears' were popular dealer
options.

Go with what you like best!

Twas writ:
I have a 67 standard bus. I need to replace the side view mirrors. Which
ones are correct? Some list the "elephant ear" as correct, while others
list
the smaller round ones as correct.
Thanks for the advice!
