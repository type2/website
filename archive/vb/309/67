Ray,

This sounds good. I have no welding/brazing or other extremely hot metal experience, but I'm interested in learning.

Any books on the subject of brazing/leading anyone would recommend?

>He cleaned up and removed all rusted areas over a period of a couple of months in his garage and then broke out his torch and brazed up the larger areas
through slow build up and leaded in all of the pits. There were also ridges and valleys along the window frame which he also leaded in.
