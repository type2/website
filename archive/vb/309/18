Oh, yeah...

27 years ago, I set out with friends in my 67 Campmobile to tour the 
US.  Started on the West Coast of Florida,  4500 miles, 700 dollars, ten 
weeks, 32 states and two provinces later, we dropped a valve in Kansas 
City, Kansas.

Natcherly, part of the trip was down the coast from Washington to San 
Francisco.  Beautiful drive, the most memorable bits were buying an Anchor 
Steam Porter in Olema, Ca. (remember the song?), and trying to find a 
camping spot in Redwood country.  All the parks were full and it was well 
past sunset, so we found a road that turned off the highway and went about 
500 meters to a point where it   Very impressive....
