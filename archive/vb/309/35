Do you think It needs to get dismantled to inspect the heads, valves?
We would definitely do that and if the heads/valves are fine then it is the 
P&Cs that need replacing.  We have replaced one P&C on an engine, but this 
requires getting an exact same diameter size which there are at least three for 
each cc size of P&C, and carefuly balancing the new piston to the other pistons 
on the engine.
