I'm sure that's the reason. Yeah.

The last administrative removal at all was in mid November, 2003 for
posting virus warnings.  And that wasn't even to the vintagebus list.


The last administrative removal from vintagebus was 11/4/03, removing a
majordomo (mailing list manager) that someone maliciously subscribed.
Prior to that, 10/9/03 due to user request.


Phil, the reason you're not getting vintagebus email...you're not
subscribed.  I'll discuss this with you offlist, but it's related to the
attbi/comcast change.
