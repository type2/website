Well, you have to take the axle tubes off.   then take the bug axle shafts 
off and undo the outer rings of nuts and pull the diff and ring gear out and 
swap it side to side.  Then install the bus axles.  Then install the rgbs.  Must 
use the bus nose cone.    Ja, it's some work.  And it's dirty and smells like 
gear oil.   liberally spray your bus w/ simple green in the tranny/ engine 
compartment, let it wait a couple hours, then take it to the car wash wearing 
ratty clothes and pressure wash the engine compartment and under the engine and 
tranns to make your life pleasanter.   Pressure wash the bug tranny too.   

  But not much more than already if you were pulling the RGBs apart and axles 
off to scope out the bearings and the fulcrum plate area.  

You need some big hefty circlip pliers to remove the axle circlips, that's 
about all the special tools.

Read your 50-62 or 63 on splitty Bentle in the tranny/ rear axle section.  It 
has nice Pictures and directions.
 I don't think Muir goes past installing/ removing the trans.   It is good 
for removing/ installing the trans ( taught me how) but don't think it gets into 
axles/ RGBs or any of that. 

But bugs do have lower 4th gears than buses/ ghias.   Unless it's a tranny 
that someone pulled out of a bus at some point and swap the ring gear over in.  
Or pulled out of a ghia.

I have heard of everyone putting bug trans in their busses. I have heard that
you have to turn the differencal(sp?) around.  Is this true? Is it hard?  Do
you need special tools?

Any help greatly appreciated!
