No need to cut your seals to remove windows. When my cargo door glass was
broken out I watched the guy at the glass shop pull my other cargo glass to
get a template. He took alot of little tack nails and pushed them under the
inside seal until the got above the glass. Then he lifted up on the nail and
pushed it into the rubber slightly. He used about 20 nails about an inch apart
and finally had the seal lifted away from the glass on one corner. Then he
patted firmly on that corner of the glass and it moved past the rest of the
seal. I have new seals which is a bonus, old seals might not like this
treatment.  I have done this method to remove all my stationary glass and
POR-15 the channels, then put the glass back using the wire/Windex method.
