Joe, all the best cars are the RHD ones.
See, if you drive on the CORRECT side of the road(the 
left) RHD vehicles are fine.
And let's face it, the left is best.
Here in the real world(Australia, UK, New Zealand,
etc.) it's the only way to drive.
Europe & the US simply got it wrong ;o)
Cheers & God Bless
