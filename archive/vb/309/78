so i am a little behind in my mail due to a break for the shasta trip ;-)

i have been on this road from all of washington to san diego. in a split bus not all 
at the same time.  generally i would say that zapper has probably been on all of it 
as well as other buses and bugs too.
most recently i took 101 to 1 to mendocino then back to 101 at ukiah to richmond then 
caught back up with 101 in sanjose to san louis obispo on the way to bbb8 that was in 
a bubble window riviera (78)  i will say that the first 30 northern miles of 1 are 
some of the windiest i have ever been on!!! fortunately my northern section of these 
roads in january was solitude.  any more on the 101 from may through september lots 
of traffic going very slowly rocking those behemoths around every corner.

in zapper it was all still windy and curvy but slower and fun and 15 years ago when 
there weren't' so many motor homes!
back when there was still soto in about 88 we rendezvoused the splitties in walnut 
creek then cruised down the 1 and 101 to anahiem.  we had about 15~ splits and a bug. 
was way cool to go around all those corners with buses to the back and buses in 
front. all shiny in the sun.... one of my favorite caravan experiences. lasted all day.
