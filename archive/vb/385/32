Subject: Re: [VB] Battery Recommendation

I had another thought about the radio and the battery. There are two power 
leads, one is to be attached to a switched power source for main power and 
another to an unswitched source for the memory. I have both leads attached 
to an unswitched source so that I can run the radio with the ignition off. 
Gee if I were to install a toggle switch onto the main lead and shut it off 
when I shut off the ignition.... Einstein, Einstein....

 Do you have a new radio in the vehicle? The new ones with a CD take a small
 trickle of current even when off. Its not supposed to be enough to make 
much
 of a difference to the natural discharge rate of the battery but in my case
 it does. If I don't drive it each week the battery seems to die down.

 me too.
 i have both hot leads of my radio always on power so not only the standby
 is on but the illumination as well even when its off.
 If I dont drive for a week or longer it needs a charge or it wont start.
