Subject: re:Battery Recommendation

Another thought on this.

They sell shut-offs, that you can install right at the battery. This way you
turn the battery connection off, whenever you are parking the car for an
extended period of time.

I think your best bet is to try to find where the battery drain is. You
should be able to leave your car for a couple months, and start it up. I
have a modern radio in my squareback, and sometimes I'll go a couple weeks
without starting it. And I have no problem starting it.
