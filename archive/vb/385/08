Block the wheels, release the parking brake handle inside the Bus, and
then get under the Bus to see if the cables are slack or not.  Sometimes
the cables rust to the tube they run in, so even when you release the
handle inside the cab, the rust is holding the brakes on for you.  You
might try a reasonable amount of rattling the tubes around to free up
the cables if you suspect this is the problem.

The '74 Bug I now have sat outside for a couple of years and it had this
same problem.  My Dad got in it, put it in first, gunned it, let it come
back to idle, put it in reverse, gunned it, let it come back to idle,
etc.  This made the car raise up and squat down as it strained against
the brakes, but finally the engine torque got the rear shoes free.  If
you're going to do this, you need a lot of clear space in front of and
behind the car, because when the shoes do break loose, the car can move
quite a ways.  Also, put at least the castle nuts back on before you try
this.  Once the shoes are loose, go ahead and pull the drums off to see
what's going on in there.

It's much less likely, but a problem in the lines or master cylinder
might mean that hydraulic pressure is holding the rear brakes on.  To
check this one, open up the bleeder screw on each rear drum and see if
that makes the brakes release.  If it does, the probability is high that
you need to replace all the rubber flex lines in the brake system.
