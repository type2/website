Subject: Bus Mud Flaps

Hiya gang,
I have a set of Mud Flaps that I was planning on installing on my 66 bug, 
but I sold it, so now I would like to install these same mud flaps on my 
67 Sundial Camper.  The mud flaps look identical to the ones that I've 
seen installed on busses, they are black w/ a white VW logo.  My question 
is, will the bug brackets fit for installation on my bus?  Or, do I need 
to search for a pair of bus mounting brackets? 

I understand that these mud flaps are hard to come by, now that VW is 
enforcing their ownership of the logo.  Will I have trouble locating 
replacement brackets because of this?  Anybody have any brackets they 
would like to sell?  Or, I would probably buy a complete set, with the mud 
flaps for a reasonable price.

Thanks,
Ed Richardson
