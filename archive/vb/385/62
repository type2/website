Subject: At least I'm not that crazy...

So,

Some of you may know my goal of "someday" rebuilding my bus as a  
"safari bus" and all the problems that go along with that, such as  
being shunned by resto houses and mechanics, not to mention VW  
purists. But I digress....

This morning I found some evidence that I'm not as crazy as some  
other people:
