Subject: Re: [VB] reduction gear box

 It hapened to me once, exatly with the same wheel. The problem was the 
parking brake that loose one part and
 it make the weel to stop at once. like if i had strongly pull the brake 
very fast.

 Remember to take a carefull look, before open the Reduction box.
