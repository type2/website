Subject: Battery Recommendation

Hi gang,
Need a new battery for my 67 Sundial Camper.  I don't drive it too much, 
and it seems that every time I go out to start it, (about every 4-6 weeks, 
as a rule), the battery is dead.

I was thinking about an Optima battery.  Anyone out there with any success 
stories with this battery?  What model 12-volt Optima did you install? Are 
there any other brands of batteries that I should consider?  I want to get 
the best that I can.

Thanks for your help.

Ed
