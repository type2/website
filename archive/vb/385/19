Subject: Re: [VB] Steering box

 If there is a tight spot in the steering gear box, you should adjust it so that the toght spot goes away.   This may increase play, as the box may have been adjusted tight to get rid of slop, if it's a worn box.  
 
Have you checked the rest of your steering for play?   It rarely is just from one component... so do the lie undereath and have a friend wiggle the steering wheel while you watch things move, and check the play in the king and link pins ala John Muir too.
 
You can get rebuildt SGBoxes, I don't think nwe ones are available.
