The brackets are what I need.  The ones that came with these Mud Flaps 
originally are "L"-shaped.  I think the ones I need now attach to the 
splash pan bolt on the "Outer" side of the bus, and to the bumper bracket 
bolt on the "Inner" side of the bus.

Does anyone out there have a set of these brackets that they would be 
willing to part with?
