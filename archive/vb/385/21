Subject: EXHAUST MANIFOLD LEAK

Every red light my bus was stalling.  Of course, I couldn't find what was 
the problem, took it to the mechanic and he found a hole in the pipe coming 
out of the exhaust manifold.  He suggests I either find the pipe and he will 
replace it .. or I leave it with him and he will take it to a welding shop 
or ?? I was thinking, maybe I get another manifold? OR .. Someone mentioned 
something about a "strap" or maybe they said "band."  Which makes me think 
of bandaid .. but in any case, would something like that work until I get 
the repair done?
