Subject: RE: [VB] Crewcab Interior Panels

The rear panels of a double cab are simple masonite, painted, with the
smooth side out, just like the headliner pieces for all trucks.  Front
door panels are a different material, a tar board of sorts and are found
in most/all other commercials in the era.  Vinyl covering for
commercials happened after 63 or so).  Commercial busses used the same
tar board material for headliner pieces, unlike the trucks.
