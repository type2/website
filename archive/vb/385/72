Subject: Fuel Pump Problems

I have a DP 1600 stock engine in my '67 westy.  I have fuel leaking out of the
top of the fuel pump.  At first I thought it was the bolt that holds the
"dome" down on top of the pump but I have discovered that it is bottom of the
dome where it meets the body of the pump...fuel is seeping out at that point.
I took it apart and cleaned that area and looked for a defective gasket that
sits on top of the screen.  Couldn't find a problem, put it back together and
it still leaked.  I then took that pump off and put on a new Bosch fuel
pump...same problem.  Any suggestions?
Thanks,
Tom
