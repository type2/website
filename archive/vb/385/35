No - Edison, Edison. :-)  That's exactly what I did in my bus.  Unswitched power for the clock & presets, and a toggle under the dash for the main.  I just flick it on when I want to listen to tunes, and the illuminated display on the radidio usually reminds me to turn it off when I leave the vehicle.  Doesn't kill it if I forget once in a while.  I had the sits-for-a-week dead battery prob before, too.
