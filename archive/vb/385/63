Hi Conrad,
There is a HUGE differance between crazy and just plain stupid....   ;-)
  If that bus sells for anywhere near that price we should go into  selling 
new shoes with 3" sawed off the toe end and sell them for ten times  the new 
price.  All because they are "Unique" and "Talk of the  block" kind of shoes.
