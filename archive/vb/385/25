Ed,

Try disconnecting the radio to see if that is really the problem. Sometimes
other issues can be involved such as leaky diodes in an alternator or a bad
regulator or simply worn out insulation somewhere in your wire harness. The
worst that can happen with worn out insulation is a fire, so its worth the
effort to discover the true problem.

  I do have a new radio/cd player in this bus.  If it does draw some current,
then I guess that is even more reason to get a more powerful battery that will
hold a charge longer.
