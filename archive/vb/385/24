Hi,

Do you have a new radio in the vehicle? The new ones with a CD take a small 
trickle of current even when off. Its not supposed to be enough to make much 
of a difference to the natural discharge rate of the battery but in my case 
it does. If I don't drive it each week the battery seems to die down.
