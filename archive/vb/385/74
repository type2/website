I have all components to retrofit the airflaps on the engine, as well as
components for heat risers (1600 DP motor).  The cross-over riser warms up
ok...these will be fitted before I reinstall the engine.  With all in order
the engine should warm properly and minimize the carb-ice stumble after
excessive idle/low speed operation!
