Subject: Re: [VB] Battery Recommendation

Trickle battery chargers are commonly available and are designed for the  car 
that is not driven frequently. 

I have one in my bus and have wired  it so that there is an easy to use plug 
to turn it on when parked and un plug  when I drive off. I use the "Westy" 
shore power device for this.
 
Battery is always strong and lasts longer if kept charged.
