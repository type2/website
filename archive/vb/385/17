Ronnie,
Take another look at the output shaft of the gearbox. Mine rocks up and down 
or back and forth. If yours does this, have a machine shop check the 
roundness of the bore and the shaft. If the bore is out of round, they may 
be able to bore it out and install a sleeve. If the shaft is out of round, 
it can be plated up and machined back to size.

I would be surprised if any  new spare parts are available.

Chris
