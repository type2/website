Subject: Re: [VB] brakes broke

I'd put the wheel back on and hit the lugs with a hammer. Don't pound them  
just a good solid hit. Do that about 3-4 times per lug nut and see if that  
helps. Sometimes the brakes stick to the drum. If that doesn't work then try and  
rock the bus back and forth to jar the brakes loose. Good luck. Hope that  
helps.
