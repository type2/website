Did you check the link pin? Loose link pins make for sloppy steering. Check 
your wheel bearings too. Start at the wheels and work your way back looking 
for anything loose or sloppy. Inspect the king pins, tie rod ends, link 
pin....
Have someone sit in the cap and rotate the steering wheel back and forth 
2-3" while you look at all the parts below.

I have a problem with my box too, Looks like the output shaft is rocking in 
its bushing. I have the advantage of having a spare box, my original. Gonna 
take it apart one of these days soon and try to figure out how to get rid of 
the sloppies.
