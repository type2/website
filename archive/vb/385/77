Subject: HOSED by a transport company!

the waterheaded jackoffs at COMPLETE AUTO SALES of grand prairie 
texas just screwed me over BIG time - after 4 MONTHS of discussing 
the hauling of my 70 bus from phoenix to texas, they said today that 
not only had they scheduled it to be picked up after this weekend 
(the paperwork clearly stated it had to be picked up BEFORE), they 
then DENIED ever hearing about the job! *sswipe, i spoke to you 2 
days ago about it :P

'waaaaaal, tony did the contract, and he quit. so we just tossed his jobs.'

so now i am stuck with a bus that MUST leave phonix for west texas by 
monday, and to make things more exciting, the people i am renting the 
moving truck from (budget) have no more trailers or dollies for this 
weekend.

any suggestions?
