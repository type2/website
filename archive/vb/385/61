The latest use and abuse of the great splitty bus. Perhaps not remarkable
given the fact that buses are selling for $50-70K in some instances. I think
I spy a Dormobile in the second photograph:

P.S. Speaking of Dormobile, I have an original Dormobile poptop for sale on
thesamba.com which I'd let go at a very fair price, high returns not
expected.
