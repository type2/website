Hi Kevin,
There are dozens of reasons for that failure.  So only an inspection  will 
make it clear of what happened.  As for the rest of the bearings, they  are 
suspect.  When a bearing goes so does lots of hard metal chips.   In otherwords it 
is alot like having a circle of friends and have a grenade go  off in this 
circle!  More than likely everyone is going to get some  damage.  We have used 
bearings that have been used and had other bearings  go bad, BUT have carefully 
inspected each outer and inner race of each bearing  to make sure there is no 
damage.  Even then we only use new ball bearings  as a set.  Collecting up 
good used bearing till a set is complete, and ten  will use them.
