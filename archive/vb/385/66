Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Mud Flaps

Hello,
Thank you for your response.

The brackets are what I need.  The ones that came with these Mud Flaps 
originally are "L"-shaped.  I think the ones I need now attach to the 
splash pan bolt on the "Outer" side of the bus, and to the bumper bracket 
bolt on the "Inner" side of the bus.

Does anyone out there have a set of these brackets that they would be 
willing to part with?  I've noticed that parts houses such as CIP-1 have 
complete sets of Mud Flaps with Empi logos.  I've emailed these suppliers 
to ask if the sell the brackets separately, but I have not heard back from 
them yet.

Thanks,
Ed
