Subject: Steering box 

Were can I get a steering box for my 67 bus? Can the parts be bought to  
rebuild them? I know I can look on line but, as most things rebuilt some are  done 
nice and some aren't. I'm in Richmond VA. If someone is local great if not  
that's fine also. I've put 2 "good" ones in and I still have play in the  
steering box. The 2 I have put in have that tight spot in them with 2 inches of  
play. I can deal with the play as I have for 15 years of bus driving. The tight  
spots I can't deal with. 
 
Thanks in advance.
