Subject: Re: [VB] brakes broke

 If the first/reverse thing doesn't work, try taking off the rim, and whacking the outside flat rim of the drum with a large heavy object.  Not the corner.  I like to use a 8 lb maul on a 3' handle.  Feel free to yell while doing this.   It makes a dull thud when the shoes are stuck to the drum, and a higher ring when the shoes brake loose.   Do this one side at a time for safety's sake. :)  I trust you have a good jack. ( not the jack that came with the bus)   Using a jackstand as well is not a bad idea.
