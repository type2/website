One step ahead. I already had that message saved.
Are you running the porsche pulley still?
If so which belt did you decide on?
I like the belt to ride up pretty high as It seems to last longer.
I am also suspecying that there might be a ratio that is too high and the
speed of the fan could start to become a problem either with air flow
(cavitation maybe) or mechanically with the stock fan.
thanks
