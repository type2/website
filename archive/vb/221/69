I couldn't agree more; great chat and good volks! I'm glad you enjoyed our tales. John and I have plenty of them, all true, albeit a little stretched for a more dramatic delivery but good tales none the less! 
I know JP beat you out of the long distance award but if there was an award for "Coolest Mattell Accessory" I am sure that Barbie would have won!
See you at BYOB!
