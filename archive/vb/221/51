Nice side-step ( stud:) , E&B !
The question remains:
How do you replace the oil pick-up mount / sump plate stud  ???
Has Ray got a 6/8/6 stud for that :) ?
My theory... If that particular stud is stripped externally,
and the pick-up side is firm, you must split the case
to repair it. Or seriously bend a wrench !
