Ya, no hardware needed .  There should be two tangs on the body of the bus, 
which clip into the corresponding hoops under the front of the seat.   This 
way to getteh spare tire you take the back of the seat and push it forward 
and it pivots on the bottom front edge.  Behind it are holes that are for the 
screws to attach the rubber bumpers.  Think the seat back mushes up against 
those bumpers.    Never had a 2/3 seat go anywhere, except once when the seat 
had a broken hoop, so it was only attached on one side, that seat wiggled 
annoyingly. (wasn't in my bus)
