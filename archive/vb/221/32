the disc brakes don't need barely any pressure. 
Yes you will actually have to push down on the brake pedal with drum brakes. 
 That said, if you actually stand on the pedal, the bus should come to a 
schreeching halt and things from behind should fly forward, maybe whacking 
you on the back of your head etc.  

Warn any passengers first, please.  

brakes should not pull of course..  Nor squeak.

New brake hoses - the flex lines- make a difference.

<< How hard does the pedal need to be pressed to
 stop the bus. I will be checking the brakes the next day or so, but
 have yet to verify all corners work correctly. When I got in my bay
 window to move it after driving the split, I felt like I was going to
 push the pedal through the floor. Now obviously there is a lot less
 pressure needed w/ vacuum assist brakes, but just wanted to field
 suggestions on how a properly setup brake system should feel.
