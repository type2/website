Subject: time to sell

Time to sell my '67 deluxe. I am wanting someone on the list to get it, to
keep it "in the family" of VW loyalists.

For other pictures of other areas, please email and I will see what I can
do.
Only asking $1k. I do believe it is about 72k miles on it (have to look at
speedo again), all one owner. OG engine, not running. No mods, very little
rust, been sitting in a high desert location for 26+ years on blocks. Nose
has damage from a run in with a Road Runner, I heard. It actually improved
the driving I was told too...LOL   OG glass, front windows cracked, back
window gone. All other glass is OG and good. Front seat is just frame and
does not have back. Middle seat is frame only but is all there. Back seat is
there, with some OG material.

Like I said, want someone who will get it going to have it, not to part it.
Will need to trailer it away.
I have had it in my front yard for over a year, and did 2 things to it.
Removed the motor and gas tank. I will even give you any books I have for
it, and anything else I have that belongs to it.
