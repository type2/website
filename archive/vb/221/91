that sounds like a good idea, I will do that.

I am able to worm my way around the doghouse & see the insert,
complete with scars from a wrench. So it is definately the insert.

yea, somehow. I would love to take a monkey wrench to the side of his
head right now. :) Andy suggested that there is actually enough
clearance in the notch for the bolt to rotate. I'm going to try it
again after work tonite now that I am rested up. but if not I guess I
will have to cut it off.

Oh and speaking of previous owners. The bolts that hold on my drivers
side gearbox on are wheel lug bolts! The ones with the taper shoulder.
Unfortunately 2 of the bolts on that side will not hold the spec
torque so I will have to do some sort of thread insert.
