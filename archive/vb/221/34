Subject: 58 middle seat for sale / shipping ????

Hi, I have a full width metal grab bar middle for sale on the samba, it's
from a 58 and has the pea green original upholstery in pretty good shape.
I  am going to update the ad and include shipping via forward air and
leave the price the same. Anyways, I called forward air and they say it
needs to be in a box. Does this box need to be wood like a crate or
cardboard? I thought I could buy plastic wrap and wrap it real nice and
tight but the forward air guy says no. Does anybody have suggestions on
boxing it? should I undo the grab bars so they don't get damaged? Thanks
for any advice.
