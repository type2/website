That's what I thunk, and I also think I ran across at least one other
vendor selling them when I was shopping around.  But thanx for the tip,
Cal.

I got the other side disassembled tonite, and the plug there was a bit
more stubborn - ended up with 3 dent-puller holes in it and it needs
flattening.  I might go ahead and order two new ones but I want to check
my fulcrum plate/axle/side gear gap first in case I need to order FPs,
too.

The FPs seem straight and flat, but along one long edge they're not shiny,
back maybe 1/4" from the edge.  They have scratches on them, deeper
towards one end.  I didn't see any cracks in them or in the side gears. 
Assuming the gap checks out I suppose they're OK.
