Subject: Aussie bus oddities 

  Well, I am tearing into the bus from OZ and here is what i have found so
far. All the lug nuts have the VW logo on them, it has the right hand drive
belly pan, not a mirror image either, it has some strage shapes in it, A
steering dampner the size of a standerd shock with an extended resovoir on
it. The usual rhd stuff, throttle, brake and  clutch etc. So far I have only
found a rats nest in the belly pan and some weird spider webs in the front
drums. Needs a steering box and actually found a rhd rebuilt at wolfgangs!
The center pin is also worn out.
  So far the front end has come apart very easy, no rust and it was well
greesed feom new it appears. King and link pins are very tight and all the
sals are still in excellent shape. We should have the whole front done by
tomorrow then onto the rear. 
  In the rear we will change the tank out with a 15 gallon bay (going to do
a lot of driving). It has a big nut trans so I will not change it unless it
needs it after driving. Will also tune up the 1500 in it and see how it does
before putting the 1800 or 1904 in it. 
  All in all it's a pretty dry bus except for the body rot.  Anyway it's fun
being able to work on my own stuff again.
