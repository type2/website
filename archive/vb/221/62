Hi Dave,
From what we have heard one has to bend up a opened ended wrench for that 
job.  If that stud is stripped out of the case it would be more likely 
someone put way too much torque on that fastener and is more like for that 
one instance to bust off the stud than to strip it or the case.  Only 6 Ft. 
Lbs torque there or you just dimple the sump plate and strip or break off 
studs.
