Oh yeah.  I didn't mean to correct you or provide an "absolute 100% true"
number, just some more information.

I would think that would tend to work the differential a little harder,
but I guess they thought it was OK.  They were probably balancing that
against the extra labor and parts costs involved with opening up the
other RGB.  I get the impression that RGB gears don't crap out that
often, and I wonder how many "mis-matched" Buses actually resulted from
that policy.

I've noticed that it varies.  There are some numbers that are the same
between all VW-published and aftermarket sources, and then there are
some that vary a little.  Sometimes I wonder if some of the numbers in
non-VW-published sources have been altered as copyright traps.  Or maybe
some records aren't very detailed and people are interpolating the numbers.

>Okay, whose got a bus with VIN between 469 447 and 469 506?

The closest Buses listed in the Registry at vintagebus.com are 468 957
(McArthurs, AL) and 469 869 (Dave Mayes, OR).
