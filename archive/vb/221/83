Subject: Engine bolt question.

So here's a bit of an odd question. I went to pull the engine and
ran into a problem with one last bolt. This is the bolt on the top
drivers side. So the transmission has a notch where the bolt is so
that it keeps it still when I tighten it. Not a problem normally, but
in this case my bus has a 1600 DP engine in it. this engine has one of
those press in threaded bushings at that location. Somehow the DPO has
managed to actually tighten this combination. I tried in vain to use
vice grips to loosen hoping that it would loosen, but no luck. Does
anyone have any suggestions for this? After I gave up last night I
thought about taking a cutting wheel and cutting off the bolt from the
transmission side, I believe I can get my dremell in there. But any
suggestions are welcome.
