Hi Andy,
We used the "Gates" brand belt till we had problems one night (NOV 02) with 
our distributor cap which caused the engine to backfire and even suddenly 
stop or even try to reverse run which broke the Gates belt.  So after 
replacing the cap we installed our spare lower RPMing "Fresh Start" brand 
belt and have been running it since then.  
  With the Gates belt we had no problems with cavitation and so far no fan 
shattering problems in our travels during May to Nov 02 and 5,507 miles of 
driving including a 1,400 mile round trip to Sacramento in the Spring.  This 
could be due to we keep our RPMs when driving between 1,500 & 3,000 RPMs with 
the a rare 3,500 RPM for only a few seconds.  We have noticed an improvement 
in cooler oil temp in warm outside temps and seems to be more stable temp 
during our trips.

>>I like the belt to ride up pretty high as It seems to last longer.<<

We had a problem simular to that when we went to the larger lower pulley.  
This tightened the earlier stock belt well into the upper pulley and promptly 
20 miles later the belt blew up.  Turned out the belt when riding down inside 
the upper pulley in an area that was rusty and this iron oxide acted as sand 
paper.  So we polished the pulley halfs and installed a new belt and had no 
problems for tens of thousands of miles after that.
