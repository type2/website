Subject: RE: [VB] stud repair

They have the over size 8mm/6mm stud replacement. I have used them before. I
just drill out the hole and tap for the 8mm threads and insert the new stud.
On one of the blocks I just threaded it in and went from there, on the others
I cleaned the block squeaky clean and coated the threads with JB Weld before
threading it in. Didn't seem to matter either way. I got my replacement studs
from a place called Tacoma Screw which deals only in hardware related items.
Maybe you have something like that in your local area.

So I was changing my oil and trying to fix a couple of bad studs when one of
em stripped completely.  It is one of those 6 that hold on the little plate
that I take off to change my oil.  So what is the best way to fix those.  I
guess I could either use some sort of insert or a bigger stud.  I like the
insert idea but I want to do what's best.
