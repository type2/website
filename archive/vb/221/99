Hi Matthew,
That would be 37-1/4" by 16-7/8".  If those two measurements are correct then 
you have one of at least five possible lids for 1955-71 bus.  For 1959-65 bus 
you want no push button latch and the center of the bolt hole for the arm 
that holds up the lid when open is 12-1/8" up from the bottom edge of the 
lid.
