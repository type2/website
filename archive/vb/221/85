I got a few responces already, which basically said just get under
then and get on it :) Looks like I did not do a proper job describing
the problem, I should have taken pics. I'll try this a bit more
verbose this time.

So on the engine side there is that immovable bushing in place of a
regular nut. This is (I assume) pressed into the case just like on the
SP beetle engine I have on the floor. It is solid & won't budge. Logic
would tell me to crawl under there & just give the bolt head a good
ole try. This is the problem. I must have crawled under/out of the bus
8 times saying "this can't be right". I can get a wrench on the bolt
however it cannot turn. It's not my feeble arm strength either :) The
transmission case has a raised "V" right next to the bolt. one of the
corners of the bolt head fits in this "V" so that it keeps it from
turning. So basically the neither end of the bolt or nut can turn. 

Not only would I love to get this bolt out, I have no idea how in
bob's name he managed to do this? I have an extra swing axle
transmission on the floor & it has this "V" as well. So this is
apparently how they are built. Very odd though.
