Pretty close guess off the top of my head, though.

Ya, funny the more modern (ie mid to late 60s editions) parts list say the 
55-63 RGs are the same, and do not list the 55-59 ones as different.   They 
do mention the number of teeth on each gear, which is excellent for 
calculating ratios.  So i pulled out the old 59 ed Workshop Manual, and ya 
they do mention the 55-59s have the 25/15 gears (or 1.4), rather than the 
25/18  (1.39) ratio.  late 50s parts lists do not mention the number of 
teeth, have the same upper gear for both BD and post Bd, but sparate stub 
axles (well they did change the housing).   Hm, note said how they retrofit 
the later gears in the earlier buses if new parts are needed.   earlier parts 
I assume were NLA, and they say it's okay to have one kind on one side and 
the other on the other!!!!
That's a surprise.  Guess that shows me to always cross reference with older 
literatre, because of all those supercessions.

Still curious as to why Doliwa has slightly different numbers.  What I'd like 
to find out  is how accurate these numbers are, and how often they are 
inacurate and in what way.

Okay, whose got a bus with VIN between 469 447 and 469 506?

 Doliwa has the change at 469 447, 19 May 1959.  Apparently they changed
 to the "modified 40 hp" or "bastard" engine at the same time.  The '67
 parts list online says the split-case transmission was used up to 469 505.
 I don't think the '50-'62 Bentley directly mentions the chassis number
 for the transmission change, but it does mention a change in the RGB
 ratio from chassis 469 506.
