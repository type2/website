Subject: Safari frame wanted

Hello all,
I'm looking for a drivers side lower safari frame.  The left corner of that frame I have is pretty crusty as someone caulked it.  All I need is the lower, but if someone has a whole (nice) frame, that would work too.  Or, if someone has a frame thats crusty in other spots, but the lower left corner is nice, I could splice it in.  Anyways, please let me know if you have one.  The bus went to the body shop today and I need to get this piece so we don't get held up.  The frame needs to be an original safari frame.
 
Thanks!
Isaiah
