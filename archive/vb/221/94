Hi Jason,
The upper right engine mounting bolt should be the very first one you remove 
not the last.  Also when installing it should be the last one you install and 
tighten.  Since you have removed the other bolts this has now probably left 
all the engine wieght against this bolt.  So put back in the other three 
engine bolts and see if that gives you some looseness in the upper right to 
remove it.  Once out either do the washer conversion Clara mentioned or 
remove the threaded insert out of the case and replace with a normal washer 
and nut.

Sweet!  Try Time-Sert for the solid inserts and make sure you order and use 
the extra long inserts they have for this job.  While you are doing this 
drill and tap the other holes in both RGBs deeper and install new bolts 40% 
longer for much better holding power.
