Subject: Fulcrum plate / axle gap ('65)

I assembled FPs, axles, & side gears tonite and best I can tell the gaps
are about .004-.006, well within spec.  To check, I set the assembly
gear-down on the bench with the axle pointed straight up, lifted the axle
slightly to where I thought the FPs would have the most slop, and tried to
get a feeler in there.

.012 (max) will start, but not slide through (meaning, I suppose, that the
FP will cant far enough to allow it in but not fit it when it is parallel
to the axle blade).  I worked my way down through the feelers until I
could get one to go through, and that was .004 on one and .006 on the
other.  Inches.

I've heard Clara and E&B talk about this process the most but I'd be
interested if anyone can confirm/deny that it sounds like I'm going about
this the right way.

Got the driver's side stuff wire-brushed and degreased tonite & will paint
it tomorrow.  When the tranny gets here I'll be about ready to start
putting things together!
