Subject: Re: [VB] Engine bolt question.

I have a similar situation in my 65.  OKay, you know the half moon bolt used 
on later splittys?.  That are held in a notch on theat side and you spin a 
nut on the rear?  Okay those shorter half moon bolts lying around fit the 
drivers side.   Ya, some tranny cases have that notch and so want the half 
moon which means you oughta have a nut on the other end of that half moon 
bolt.    Some tranny cases take the regular hex type bolt.

Well, the tranny case on my 65 has the notch, and with the doghouse etc I 
have the insert threaded thing on the case.  So I modified a couple of 
washers to fit the notch and space the head of the hex bolt out so I could 
put a wrench or socket on it.

I guess Take a good flashlight in the engine compartement and...um. Double 
check that you have the insert in the case.  Some engines don't.    So if 
there's a nut undo it with yr 17mm.  Can be tricky if you have  doghouse, but 
you can reach it.  awkwardly.

If yours does have the case insert, the DPO must have tightened the bolt down 
somehow.  So get under there with the tools and undo it, or just cut the 
d*%nbolt off.

 Not only would I love to get this bolt out, I have no idea how in
 bob's name he managed to do this? I have an extra swing axle
 transmission on the floor & it has this "V" as well. So this is
 apparently how they are built. Very odd though.
