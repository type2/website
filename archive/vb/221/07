There is a *major* misunderstanding by the general public just
what constitutes 'clearance' of a check.  You can take one of these
checks, deposit it in the bank, and within a few days your bank will
tell you it's 'cleared' if you were to ask them. However, it takes
a while for it to really *clear*.  This delay is what is working in
the scammer's favor.  On top of that, in most instances of this
scam, they want you to *wire* funds (the change) - you can't reverse
the wire transfer.  It's akin to writing a bad check for cash - lots
of cash.
