Subject: Subjective Brake question

Well my 66 made it home from eastern kentucky over the weekend. Comes
complete with the wonder steering option :) I have a few questions now
that I have the bus in my possession.

I don't have another split to compare for this, so I'm wanting (quite
subjective) opinions. How hard does the pedal need to be pressed to
stop the bus. I will be checking the brakes the next day or so, but
have yet to verify all corners work correctly. When I got in my bay
window to move it after driving the split, I felt like I was going to
push the pedal through the floor. Now obviously there is a lot less
pressure needed w/ vacuum assist brakes, but just wanted to field
suggestions on how a properly setup brake system should feel.
