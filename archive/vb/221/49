Subject: Have been lurking -- now scared (a little long)

Greetings.

I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and have been lurking
on this list because I have become interested in possibly
owning a split window bus.  I've found that there are guys
both in Fullerton and Concord California who restore old
busses and presumably other VWs as well.

I think this is way cool because I could only consider 
buying a restored, or at least solid daily driver condition
bus.  Why?  Because I'm NOT mechanically inclined.  I can 
change a battery, change a tire, install headlights, but 
that's about it.

So, I'm a little scared because mostly what this list talks
about is repair and maintenance.  

I grew up with air-cooled VWs and I'm aware that maintenance
is required on a regular basis, i.e., oil changes and valve
adjustments, and I'm prepared for that, no problem.

I don't drive often, just on weekends usually, and I don't 
have plans (at least in the near term) to take a long trip.
The bus would be our 2nd or 3rd vehicle.  

My question is, if I purchase a restored vehicle, is alot of
stuff going to break?  Am I going to have to spend all my
weekends fixing, repairing, tinkering?  Like I said, I'm cool
with the frequent maintenance aspect, but are restored busses
unreliable?

Now, I realize that this list is devoted to maintenance matters,
so obviously, if I just read this list I'll end up with the 
impression that these things are always breaking something, or
you need to go find a funny part for this or that.

Am I mistaken?  Please tell me if I'm wrong.

Regards,
