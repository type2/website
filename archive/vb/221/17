Subject: stud repair

So I was changing my oil and trying to fix a couple of bad studs when one of
em stripped completely.  It is one of those 6 that hold on the little plate
that I take off to change my oil.  So what is the best way to fix those.  I
guess I could either use some sort of insert or a bigger stud.  I like the
insert idea but I want to do what's best.


TIA
