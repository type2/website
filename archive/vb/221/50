Hi Dave,
That elongated stud to bolt the sump pickup tube from wobbling and loosening 
in its hole allowing air to be sucked into the oil pump instead of oil was 
only added to the VW engine about 1970!  A darned good modification to do for 
any earlier engines when rebuilding!  As for repairing a stripped out sump 
plate hole you are best to use the 6/8mm stud Ray has reffered to is the way 
to go.  Since this is going in a running engine and you probably can not 
completely degrease the case area for lock-tight.  You can instead center 
punch around the new stud to snug the hole to the replacement stud.
