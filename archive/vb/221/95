Subject: Tires, Camping/Road Trip preparedness

I got a set of tires at Costco last summer. 195 75 R 14 LTs  Recently I got a 
slow leak in the front right tire.  I got to costco yesterday and they said 
they'd replace it under warranty, but... they didn't have that brand 
(Kirkland) tire anymore.  So they ordered another one that would be almost 
the same.  tread pattern opposite.   hmm. should be in on friday.  Ya the 
side wall have a slight gash in it. hmmmmm.

Planning on taking a camping trip soon.  It'll probably be under a thousand 
miles, down into central Oregon, then east over the mountain and back on the 
dry side, a big loop. Going to go to some hot springs, and take our montain 
bikes.  There may be some rutted back road driving.    I can deal with a slow 
leak for a while putting around town (I don't drive many miles) putting air 
in once a week.  But definately not on a road trip.  Too bad about gas 
prices, but we have time and the weather is not too bad.

Other than having a good set of tires,... well it had a tune up 1200 miles 
ago, I think I'll double check the valves.   Change the oozing axle boots. 
(they were new about 5 years ago)  Check the tool set, return to the bus 
whatever has migrated to the garage.  Maybe polish the dash just for the 
halibut.   Find out why the stereo stopped making sounds.  I think there is a 
loose wire to the speaker.  

hm, those bike racks that strap to the back hatch, where can you get them?  I 
have a roof rack but I thought the back hatch deal might be easier to get the 
bikes on/off.
