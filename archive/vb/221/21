Just because the digits in your account increase doesn't mean the check
has cleared.  If the check bounces in the pipeline (perhaps weeks later if
Africa is involved) your bank will take the money back and you'll be left
holding the bag.

You have to ask yourself, why would anyone want to handle a transaction
that way?  There's no legitmate reason for a buyer to want to float a
check for more than the purchase unless they want to get their hands on
the cash.
