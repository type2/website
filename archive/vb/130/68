Subject: Speedometer bolt size

I decided to pull my speedo and get one of Corona Ryan's beatiful
rebuilt/restored units. He has it in a box waiting to ship, but I can't
my existing one out of the bus dash.

From what I can gather, 10mm is too small and 11mm is too large. I could
be wrong, as the space is quite cramped for much in the way of tools to
get in there.

Any thoughts are appreciated...
