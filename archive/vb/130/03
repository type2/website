What kind of paint is it? Two-stage or one-stage? Enamel or Laquer? That
will tell you more about what kind of products to use, rather than what
the vehicle actually is.

Good luck!

Can someone recommend a good wax for a restored 66 21 window?  I don't
mind paying a bit more for the product if it is worth it.  Thanks all.
