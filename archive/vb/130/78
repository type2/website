Hi everyone,
Is there a way to tell original material for the pre-67 hammocks.=20
What is the length of the rails also?

I just picked up one today that is supposedly original material and it's =
in near perfect unused condition. Told it came out of a 66 westy. But =
just want some list clarification.
The seller wanted $75, but took $50. I haven't seen an early cot in this =
shape before, much less the scarcity of early ones anyways.

Thanks in advance,
Dave Barnes
