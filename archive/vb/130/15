Hi Scott,
On our Doghoused engines this seals completely.

the casearound the flywheel? My immediate guess is that this is not important

anyone....Scott'67 Westy  <<

The ones we have tried do fit the FW properly.  We do weld a engine screw 
mounting point on the left side of this forward tin to both help keep it in 
place and seal to the #3 cylinder tin better.
  We had a friend who got a bus that was midding the complete forward tin.  
We installed a oil temp gauge and a few weeks later pulled the engine and 
installed the forward tin piece.  She noticed a twenty degree drop in oil 
temp right away!
