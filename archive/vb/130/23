Yes, I do have a *period* blue screamer kit.  I have a few santana pulleys
but I'll be forced not to use them due to other factors.   The induction
system will be a bit different than you propose... dual carbs yes (weber
dcns possibly) but think additionally a bit more exotic.

...Sounds good. How about a Santana pulley, bosch
screamer kit (metallic blue 009 and blue coil), and
dual zeniths on empi manifolds!? All period hardware!
