...
After you wash it try using a polish made for
fiberglass like those made for boats. The NAPA near
murder burger might have some! The only other options
available would be to paint it or re-gel coat it.
Gelcoat is expensive and very cost prohibitive.
Interlux makes good paint from what I have heard and
it is stocked at most marine stores, but try the
polish first it works great.
