Subject: RE: [VB] safari window install

If they are OG, the instructions on Thoms site should be just the
ticket.

Hi List,
I'm having a set of OG safari windows cleaned up and
painted by reVOLKS.com. I was wondering if anyone
could give us an idea of what we'll be up against when
we go to install? How much time should this take? Any
answers, tips, or intstruction would be greatly
appreciated. 

Thanks,
