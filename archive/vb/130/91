All,

Eric&Barb provided scans of their 1966 dealer accessory catalog with
VW's bulb charts in them.  In a couple of cases, VW listed ones that
are brighter than the ones in my chart, so I would say to go with the
ones they listed.

The scans, condensed onto one page, are here:

A table with the same information is here:

I hope this helps!
