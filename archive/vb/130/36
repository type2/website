my clamps actually have some sort of spring mechanism in them, which make=

attaching pretty easy. unfortunately i had them zinc plated to protect fr=

rust, and the plating seems to have fused some of the adjustable parts
together. It works for now but if i ever have to adjust them i may need t=

torch them to free them up. I actually started making repros out of
aluminum-but I think alum is too soft, and i ran out of time. I dont real=

have access to a milling shop like i used to.

Pics soon. The legs are T shaped, a rod lays in the gutter, then a
welded tube on the leg houses a Stainless screw that grabs a hook with a
nut welded on and grips the rails, secure, but was a PITA to get the
legs/gutter geometery happy. The silcone hose was another idea I was
considering, especially for the ladder hooks, where it goes on the main
rail of the rack. I probably should just get different sizes and do the
legs and the ladder with a more perm. Fix then.
Thanks for the advice!
