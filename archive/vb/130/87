Subject: Re: [VB] Speedometer bolt size

aren't they slotted screws? Stubbies sometimes work. Or  use a screwdriver on 
a ratchet- I use the screw driver things that came with the Snap-on impact 
set.   I also broke one (tool) getting the wiper motor out of my bus.  I put 
10mm bolts back in, much easier to undo when I took it back out to regrease 
it, but dont tell David Mayes.  :) Think the later splittys got phillips 
heads. 

If you pull the underdash tray out of the way you can actually see what you 
are doing.

 I decided to pull my speedo and get one of Corona Ryan's beatiful
 rebuilt/restored units. He has it in a box waiting to ship, but I can't
 my existing one out of the bus dash.
 
 From what I can gather, 10mm is too small and 11mm is too large. I could
 be wrong, as the space is quite cramped for much in the way of tools to
 get in there.
 
 Any thoughts are appreciated...
