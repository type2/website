Subject: RE: [VB] reaming swing lever bushings

   The weird part of reaming a beam is that it takes about 1 minute once the
bushings are in place. I have been rebuilding a bunch of beams I have here
to sell on an exchange basis, so I have this reaming thing down. I am now
starting to rebuild the king pins also on an exchange basis. Sorry no
lowered spindles I'll leave that liability on someone else.
