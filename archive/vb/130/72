Subject: RE: [VB] Speedometer bolt size

Okay, thanks for all the advice. 

I was thinking it was a bolt of some sort, but a large sheet
metal/machine screw makes better sense. I will check it tonight and try
dropping the tray to get it all undone and out.

I appreciate it!!

Rich,
It's easier just to go ahead and drop the package tray.  Use a small
mirror to look up there.  The stock fastener was a slotted screw.  You
loosen the two screws, rotate the speedo CW as I recall and drop it.
Having the package try dropped makes it easier to get the speedo out and
to look and work up in there.  I've had to do this several times lately.
After the first one you figure out the easier ways to make it work.  I
can usually just feel the screws and hold a medium slotted screwdriver
up there and undo the screws now.  I'm getting better, but will probably
forget it all by the next time.:) John
