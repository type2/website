What is the deal with overriders on DC's and SC's?

Steve,
I put them on the front of my SC because someone in the past decided to make
it a CA Cruiser and lower it by messing with the torsion bars rather than
using lowering arms in the front. I needed to drive it daily so instead of
buying another front end or rebuilding mine, I just beefed up the front
shocks for awhile. I posted pics in the misc section on vintage bus and SV2.
