Subject: por-15 on rims?

I'm getting ready to replace the 14 inch rims on my
'60 panel with the correct (and hopefully gear-ratio
increasing) 15 inchers. The new wheels are rather
rusty and need some dents banged out of the rims. This
is a daily driver, and doesn't have to be real pretty.
So I was thinking about saving some dough, and instead
of blasting them, just sand them up a bit to get the
real lose shit off, and brushing on some POR-15, then
some cheap spraypaint on top of that. Is there
anything in this plan that screams out as a really
really bad idea? Thanks for any advice...
