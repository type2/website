Subject: Re: [VB] engine stand question

Yes, it will sorta work if you use a later bell housing. But you can't split
the case very well. The one you linked to is very scary to use with the one
wheel on the end. You are better off spending a little more for more
stability. This one is double the price but safer to use:

Will the cheap harbor freight stands work or can they be made to work?  I
rememeber trying one before and for some reason it wouldn't work.

I can pick that up tomorrow or wait a week and spend more on one that was made
for vw engines.
