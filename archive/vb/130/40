Be careful on fixing dented wheels. Out of round or out of true will eat up
tires fast.
For paint I used Rustoulem Appliance Epoxy on the 65 Westy bumpers and
wheels and am very pleased with the results. Fairly durable and easy to find
touch up paint. I made one of those spray rings that sit on the rim of the
tire and protect it from paint. 3 years and 8000 miles later they still look
good.
