lucky for you, you've got a '67. That was a good year
for trannys, with a "taller" 4th gear. I'm not sure if
they introduced it in '66 or '67, but us folks with
older busses have to be satisfied with driving 55,
with occasional spurts up to 60 on the down-hills. I
used to have a '66 with a stock '67 tranny in it, and
got it up to 75 on occasion. (with a 1300 dual port
industrial motor in it!) It was a bit shaky at that
speed though. I'd reccomend cruising at 65, with
occasional spurts up to 70....just to keep your tranny
and motor happy. Also, I just don't feel safe with
stock bus brakes going faster than 65...
