Subject: Axle tube retainer gaskets replaced in situ?

Can I remove the axle tube retainer, pull the one piece boot back, the
retainer back, leave the brand new o ring alone (it a 1967 trans),
replace/reseal the two gaskets, and torque (would not be pulling axle or
rgb for this, I could slit the new gaskets and leave the cuts up top and
staggered) with the trans/engine in place? I think the trans shop might
have got a wrinkle in the shim gaskets, for a slight leak when I park
her. I've been blaming the boot clamp for this, and just replaced it
with a wide ss one, no improvement. Not going to wrench it down too
tight, it must now be an oozing retainer gasket/shim.  If I must, all
wil get yanked...later... :)
Al, trying to keep the driveway clean.
