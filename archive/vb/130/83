Please, please, please!!!! Pre-'68 
PRE_SIXTY EIGHT!!!!!

Not that I would ever over react or anything but David, you hit one of my
buttons. For some one advertising that IBUTVS(-at-)aol I am sure that you would know
that 1968 is the first year of the bay window- non-splittie buses. 1967 was the
last year of the splitty buses. I would have imagined that you would have been
tuned in.
Yes, the color of the splitty bus kinder-cots / child's cot is darker green.
Stitching is specific and non-green. Poles are black and differing lengths.
Dimensions are specific. It should be relatively easy to reproduce these items.
The trick is to find one.

Gee, I seem to remember a *1967* Westfalia that has one of these as well as the
correct *1967* Westy tent. Reproducing these things ought to be pretty easy as
long as you have a template. There might be some intrinsic value in finding all
0f these things in one spot all at the same time. Hmmmm...

Weird market in deed, it's a weird market.
