They can be made to work great if you get the bell housing from a Bay Window
002 tranny and bolt it to the pivot.  Then you can even run an engine on
there during break in or whatever else.

Will the cheap harbor freight stands work or can they be made to work?  I
rememeber trying one before and for some reason it wouldn't work.

I can pick that up tomorrow or wait a week and spend more on one that was
made for vw engines.
