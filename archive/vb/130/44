I can also supply a few more (or larger) pics if you tell me where exactly
you need a better picture.

Steve asked:
Does anyone know of a picture online of the underside of a 65'ish bus or
truck?

My 65 DC had some kind of undercar encounter where the left side of the
heater cable conduit was damaged and consequently removed. I only have a
small stub of the conduit near the torsion bar tube and I need to know where
to run a new one.
