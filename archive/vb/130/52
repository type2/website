Just back from 8,000 miles so I feel qualified to throw my two cents in.

No real seceret, save before you go and live cheap while you are out there.
Major expence is gas.  With the VB list, other friends & family, etc. I have
a place to stay about every other night.  Other nights I sleep in the bus.
No hotels, no sit down restraunts.  (One pizza can feed you for a day BTW)
As far as not working, you work like hell before you go and after you get
back.  Live *beneath* your means year round and you can have the money to
spend.

Life is a journey, not a destination.  Enjoy it as you go along.
