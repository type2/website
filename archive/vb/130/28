Best solution would be something a little bit sturdier like the one below
and have a couple of different pivots/mounts for it so you have flexibility
to do different jobs:)  In defense of the single front wheel I have actually
built up a 429 Cadillac engine on the stand I have although it is a little
better quality than the one HF has.

Yes, it will sorta work if you use a later bell housing. But you can't split
the case very well. The one you linked to is very scary to use with the one
wheel on the end. You are better off spending a little more for more
stability. This one is double the price but safer to use:
