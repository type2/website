Subject: safari window install

Hi List,
I'm having a set of OG safari windows cleaned up and
painted by reVOLKS.com. I was wondering if anyone
could give us an idea of what we'll be up against when
we go to install? How much time should this take? Any
answers, tips, or intstruction would be greatly
appreciated. 

Thanks,
