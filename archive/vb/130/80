Should be army green canvas. Two black poles of differing length. Shorter
pole obviously goes to front of bus where cabin narrows in. Don't have a
measuring tape handy to tell you exactly lengths unfortunately.

Frankly I am not really sure why these things command such a price. Two
metal poles and a hunk of canvasshouldn't be that hardto fab or repop should
they?

Hi everyone,
Is there a way to tell original material for the pre-67 hammocks.
What is the length of the rails also?

I just picked up one today that is supposedly original material and it's in
near perfect unused condition. Told it came out of a 66 westy. But just want
some list clarification.
The seller wanted $75, but took $50. I haven't seen an early cot in this
shape before, much less the scarcity of early ones anyways.

Thanks in advance,
Dave Barnes
