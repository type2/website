Subject: Bus sights in a movie!

Hi Volks,
Just been watching and old movie called "Skelleton Coast" filmed about 1964.  
We spotted one blue and yellow Luftansia VW bus from the left engine vent 
rearward after the hero in the movie gets off a Boeing built Luftansia jet.  
Next was complete rightside driveby shot of a blue with white top Kombi with 
the rare AC hump on the back of the roof, when the hero was chasing a guy 
through town on foot!  Otherwise the movie is a slow one.....
