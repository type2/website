I have a reamer that I loan for free with the purchase of the center pin
kit. You just have to pay the shipping back to me.

I'm getting ready to replace the swing lever bushings
on my bus...wolfsburg west rents a reamer with their
kit, but it's reserved until late august! So i'm
thinking about getting my own adjustable reamer...but
I don't want to spend a lot...Does anybody know what
size I should look for, and where I might be able to
get one cheap? ebay doesn't look promising right
now...or better yet, anybody have a reamer they could
lend/rent/sell? I've got some goodies I could trade
for the use of a reamer (pop-out-latches, seat
brackets, gas guage, 14" wheels, ash tray,
etc...)thanks,
-russ henry
