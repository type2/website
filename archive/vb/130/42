There is a good automotive paint & supply place off the 405 at Euclid
that I usually go to.

Not sure if they have it, but they are pretty close to you...

I am having my 61 DC's front nose & rockers sand
blasted tomorrow.  After that i want to Por-15 the
inner frame before i weld on the new outer skin.

Anyone know who sells Por-15 in So. Cal.  Huntington
Beach area would be great.  Looking for a pint of Grey
or black.

Thanks
