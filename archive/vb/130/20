Subject: case numbers, double cab progress

Hi All,

After the classic, I've decided that a 40hp Okrasa engine is just too lame
for the double cab so I'm off for something a bit more *interesting* and of
course it will be totally vintage.  The motor will be based on a 1600 case
with dual port heads of which I have many of the pieces already:
- 78.4 okrasa crank
- 88mm empi P/Cs
- rimco rods
- real 'Race Shop' ported heads... these things are awesome!
- empi header and muffler
- etc. etc. and a few surprises.
- I'll be looking for some vintage hardware of course

Anyway, I have two cases in my garage that appear to be candidates for the
job but I'm having problems determining just what they are based on their
serial numbers:

- one is stamped 53N126 with a VW 113 101 102B cast into the side bottom.
- the other is E579839


Any thoughts on what is what?

David
