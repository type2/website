Subject: ARC vs. MIG - torsion bars

hi all. i am rebuilding the front end in my 56 bus. i have 
disassembled it to the point where i have removed the 2 sets of torsion bars. 
one set, i believe the uppers, are cracked at the welds on both ends, so that 
the leafs can be separated into 3 smaler groups. the lower set is cracked only 
at one end, and only for 2 of the leafs. 

my question is: should i be concerned? i feel like the 
welds are there strictly to hold the leafs from "slipping" outwards, and they 
have no bearing on flexibility or overall strength since they are contained in 
the trailing arm. i have in the past installed the leaf spring clusters with a 
broken weld at one end with no problems, but the set with both 
ends broken is a little alarming to me. i was considering taking a grinder 
wheel to the old weld down the center and making a groove in the weld and just 
MIG welding it to keep them together. any and all VW service manuals i have read 
say to ARC weld. will MIG be too hot or is there something special about that 
fancy looking, nicely laid puddle that the factory did?

i don't think bug torsion bars are welded and i can't 
recall them "slipping" outwards, so again, should i be concerned? i guess i 
could always have them welded when they were installed.

any suggestions?

jon
