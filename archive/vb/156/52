Ok, it's about 5 weeks and counting until that most special of events,=20
Oktoberbus.  Those of you that have experienced this wondrous campout=20
should really keep our secret to yourselves, since we really don;t want=20
others to come and spoil all the fun.

What fun?
Hmm.  For starters, a secluded camping spot in a private campground.  No=20
hookups so your neighbors won;t wake you up at 5am watching the news.
Some of the finest people you'd ever want to camp with.
The usual door prizes (bring prizes to donate if you want door prizes).
The world famous Full Moon Bus Club Breakfast Burritos!  (YUMMY!!!!)
Pickin' and singin' in the pavilion.
A good chance of rain, probably 50% (it either will or it won't).
An engine case might be sacrificed at the ceremonial fire.
Showers and bathroom facilities a pleasant short stroll away from our=20
camping spot so as not to offend the more delicate of nose.

But wait, there's more!
This year is Sherry's and my first time running this event and we have a=20
few ideas in mind.

Many campouts have 'best site' awards and such.  Hallowe'en is our favorite=
=20
holiday so screw the 'Martha Stewart' crap, let's decorate our buses and=20
sites in an appropriate fashion.  There will be a best Hallowe'en decorated=
=20
polling, everyone votes on who did the best job decorating.  This should be=
=20
a challenge, because you still have to camp in your bus.  A haunted tent=20
competition could be an alternative but we'll save that for next year.

What is Hallowe'en without 'Trick or Treating'?  Bring goodies for the=20
young'uns (and "adults" if you've a mind). Costumes are not required but=20
could also be fun.

And, of course, Oktoberbus T-shirts.  Some people might still be wearing=20
last year's shirts proudly (some might not yet have taken theirs=20
off!).  Some could well be found in fine art museums around the world.  But=
=20
no more will ever be made again.  Don;t miss out, this year's will be=20
collector's items to be sure.  Just think - you would be the envy of all=20
your friends when you sport your Oktoberbus 2002 T-shirt at sporting=20
events, the beach, or formal event.  Again, the artwork is a secret, but=20
guaranteed unique and whimsical.

These fine shirts will be printed on high quality T-shirts, suitable for=20
Tie-dyeing if Jay and Lynn bring their stuff (hint?), and available=20
pre-order only, delivery at the campout.  Shipping is available at greatly=
=20
increased co$t.  Once I get the quote from my printer I'll be able to post=
=20
all the sordid details.

Seeya there
