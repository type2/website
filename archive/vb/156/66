Andrew,

What worked for me was to use wrap the seal with masking tape every six
inches down onto the window frame, and leave it on for several weeks - no
grease, no goop. This was recommended by the restoration shop that worked
on the bus. Several weeks later, I removed the tape, and the doors worked
with a bit of friction, but became normal after a short time.
