Mark,

The mechanisms may be worn out - excessive play (wiggle-factor) in
critical parts. It certainly seems this way from your description, as
torquing it down jams it. My locks were getting like that many years ago,
and with the restoration in 94-95, I just dumped some more money into it,
and replaced both L,R front lock mechanisms - bought them from Vintage
Parts, formerly on Victory Blvd in beautiful Burbank, CA. I don't know
where they are now, but a search on Google should tell you.
