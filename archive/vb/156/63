Subject: Re: [VB] loose oil drain cover studs correction

Hi BB,
To properly fix a stripped oil stud hole you need a new stud/s that are 6mm 
for half thier length and 8mm on the other.  Then drill and tap the case for 
the 8mm end/s of the new stud/s and install.  Center punching around the 
tapped hole/s once the new stud/s are in place will help tighten/lock up the 
threads from allowing the stud/s from turning.
