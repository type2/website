Hey Curt,

Next time take them down to your FLUBS (friendly local sand blaster) and
for about 5-10 bucks a rim (maybe less) they will strip them to nothing
in short order.  The only thing you'll have to do is use a dental pick
to get the grit out of the cracks.

No muss no fuss and a bit cheaper when you factor in the wheels and
striper and everything else.
