I drive my Bus everyday and I have had  my rims
powdercoated. They have no chips, no fading and still
look great after 5 years! I had 5 rims done for $150,
not a bad fdeal when you consider the longevity of the
result and the time/materials involved in re-painting
your rims. I do wash bus once a week but even on long
trips they still clean up great. 
 I only use Krylon when I spray paint too. There is no
substitute. I have also added a few coats of clear to
things I have spray painted for a longer lasting and
more glossy finish.
 Also, if you want to keep your rims looking good
longer, tell the tire place to use the "sticky
weights" and put them on the inside of the rim. It
prevents chipping the paint when they put the clamp
style weights on and it is one less place for dirt to
accumilate.
