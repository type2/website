Hey All,

Speaking of jacks....I scored a stock one that looks mint but once I crank 
it util the shocks start to raise it ceases to raise:(  I haven't inspected 
it much but doesn't just have a worm gear or somethin like a scissor jack?  
I want a bus Jack!  My 2 ton craftman sux and is real heavy!  Besides all 
the blocks I need to get Sprout of his 225/70/15s is no pic nic!

TIA,

Eric
