So basically, he's complaining that he
bought an $6K Bus for $2K?  ;(

Yeah, I hate getting a deal too.  That's
why I never buy VWs that are underpriced,
I just refer them to the NADA guide so
they can adjust accordingly, it's only
fair.  I make 10-20 calls per week and
everyone thanks me or at least that's
what I think "Why don't you f%$king buy
it then?" means.

On the other hand, my '55 Kombi is under
priced:

Model: KOMBI STATION WAGON
Weight: 2,127
Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price: $2,295
Low Retail:  $3,600
Average Retail:  $5,500
High Retail:  $8,250

I would say the condition is average at least,
I'm confident I could sell it for more than
$5,500.
