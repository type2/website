JP,
It's more like there's something producing friction to keep the
mechanism from moving all the way (and it won't lock using the inside
door handle, either, not just when using the pin on the back of the
tumbler mechanism on the handle). Still, the extra diameter on the pin
sounds worth a try, since it logically seems that it would help better
force the locking part into place.

Thanks,
	Mark
