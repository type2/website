One think I have learned about Bus wheels is that there is no way to keep
them looking perfect on a street-driven bus.  A trailer queen is another
story, but I drive my bus.

What I do is, just before I get new tires, I take a good rotary wire brush
in a drill motor
and knock all the dirt and loose paint off of the wheel.  Wipe down the
rim with paint thinner (or any solvent that evaporates completely) and a
clean cloth.  Keep wiping until the cloth comes off clean.  The idea is to
leave a firm base for new paint.

Give the wheel a couple of coats of Krylon silver.  It's very close to the
original silver color of the rims.  You don't have to mask the tires,
since they are worn out anyway.

The silver color seems to last about as long as the tires, so you simply
repeat the process when you next change them.

The inside of the rim (inside the tire) doesn't need painting and paint
buildup wouldn't help anything here.

The inside of the rim (brake drum side) isn't seen, so painting here isn't
useful either.  Just get the major tar chunks out of there.

BTW, the original paint on the rims was far from concours-quality!
