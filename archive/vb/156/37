According to the 63-67 Bentleys, the welded end torsion bars are the
replacement for the separate leaf bars. Separate leaf bars were to be used
until stocks ran out, but the welded end bars were preferred.

I only have the '63 - '67 manual as a reference, but it seems like if
the leaves were originally welded, they need to stay welded, _unless_
you change to the later torsion arms that have a washer in the end to
keep the torsion bar leaves from working outward.
