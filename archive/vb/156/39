Subject: Re: [VB] Hard to open pop outs

So what was decided as working the best.  I recently replaced the top door
seal on my '67 Deluxe, and now the doors are really hard to open.  I've
tried White Lithium Grease, WD-40, 3-in-1 All Purpose Grease, Vaseline, and
Silicone Spray.  None lasted longer than an hour.  Any ideas???
