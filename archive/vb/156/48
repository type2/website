i'm a little confused on this, different part numbers?
 different shapes?  i've now seen two original camper
interiors (1960) w/ black hooks.  i've also seen
photos of several w/ chrome...  the chrome look like a
different shape, but the blacks are the spitting
image, at least to the untrained eye.  weird... 
anyone know if chrome is correct for '60, or is
black????
