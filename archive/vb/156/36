I only have the '63 - '67 manual as a reference, but it seems like if
the leaves were originally welded, they need to stay welded, _unless_
you change to the later torsion arms that have a washer in the end to
keep the torsion bar leaves from working outward.

The '63-'67 manual calls for "electric welding".  Thinking about what
most shops would have probably had at the time, their electric welder
would be an arc welder.  As far as I can tell, the only other kind of
welding that would have been common would have been oxy-acetylene "gas"
welding.

The engine section seems to back this up a bit - page M-14 9.  "Close
the outer oil hole on all rocker arms with an electric welding spot...
Gas welding is not suitable."

I am guessing that they were concerned about the heat treatment on the
torsion bars.  I think the heat would be much more localized with arc
welding than with gas welding.  Since MIG is basically another kind of
arc welding, IMHO it would be OK.
