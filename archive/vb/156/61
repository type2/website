Gary,

Go to Sears, and buy their 1.5 ton ($30) small floor jack, and while
you're there, get two nice jackstands too. I did this 12 years ago, and
everything still works great, and the jack is small enough to disappear
under the bed. Use a small 6" length of 2x4 between the jack and the
frame, and lift the front or rear up either on the last two inches
of horizontal area (before the up-curving sections) of the front-to-rear
runners (if they are in good condition), or use the torsion tubes and
then place a jackstand under the torsion tube and lower the jack. Don't
bother trying to use the jackpoints for lifting in any case.
