depends how sharp your drill bits are and how many bolts you need to drill
out.

Thank you for the advise!

My buddy said that this will take me 10 hrs a day for about 3 or 4 days!
He says is SUPER DUPER HARD?!!!
Is that true!

Your have to carefully drill the broken bolts out.   use a smaller size, then
after you drilled all the way through use a size up, till you can tap them
out.   It is a pain.
Be careful
Aim straight.
next time, use an impact when removing those bolts.

Always use grease or antiseize on the threads when installing fasteners.
Then is is easier to remove them years later.

Or, if you hate the guy you are sellingthe truck to, use saltwater.   :)

body where then bolt on/in.
