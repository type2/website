Subject: Stuck rear brake, need advice.

Hi,

My 64DD Kamper is ill. The passenger side rear brake as become stuck over 
the last month while I was not driving her. She was garaged the entire time. 
The parking brake was pulled gently.

Any tips on getting the brake unstuck?  So far I've reved her up in reverse 
and tried to back up. ( don't want to try forward as I could hit the front 
of the garage if she lets loose.

Of course I will want to remove the drum and check out whatever is going in 
inside. I have a socket. Just need to borrow a 3/4" breaker bar. Already 
tried with my 1/2" with an adapter. Sprayed the nut and threads with Kroil 
to try and loosen it up.

Thanks Guys,
Chris
