Thanks Anthony,

Also tried my air impact wrench. No luck. Gotta get that brake shoe loose
first. Thought maybe the impact wrench might shake things up.

  I suggest getting one of those steel banjo shaped tools with the correct mm
size nut hole.  You put it on the not and then you hammer on the panhandle of
the tool.  Works much better than a breaker bar and those tools are very cheap
- I think EMPI makes them.  Does anyone know what they are called?  After 38
years of jumping up and down on breaker bars, I will never do that again.
Geez - scrape together 13.99 and buy one.  A 3/4" breaker bar costs 30 bucks!
Unless you wanna keep going back to Harbor Freight returning them cause thew
"bent".
