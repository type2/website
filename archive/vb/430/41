Subject: re:Camper sleeping

I always slept with my head at the rear of the bus, unless a slope indicated
otherwise. Then sometimes I started to get a bit claustrophobic back there,
so I started sleeping with my head towards the front. This also reduced head
banging on upper cabinet. The problems with this orientation is losing
pillows, and my feet hitting the rear hatch.

My solution was to make a custom screen for the rear hatch, that is held in
place with magnets sewn into the edges of it. Now, I am back to head towards
the rear hatch, the pillows don't fall off, and my feet are free to extend.

My wife and are expecting a child any day now, so this may change our
orientation again-once we figure out where to put the little critter.
