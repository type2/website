Subject: Re: [VB] Single Cab: DROPGATES broken bolts

Your have to carefully drill the broken bolts out.   use a smaller size, then
after you drilled all the way through use a size up, till you can tap them
out.   It is a pain.
Be careful
Aim straight.
next time, use an impact when removing those bolts.

Always use grease or antiseize on the threads when installing fasteners.
Then is is easier to remove them years later.

Or, if you hate the guy you are sellingthe truck to, use saltwater.   :)
