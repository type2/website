Hi strangers,

My wife and I order our coffee from a fair trade / organic place in
Americus, Georgia, and I recently learned that their bus needs work as
described below. Not sure if they plan to pay in coffee beans, but it
might be worth further inquiry if you're curious. The company's
website is http://www.cafecampesino.com.

Cheers,
Joe Clark

Hi Joe,

Thanks very much for the response and helpful offer.

The van needs some body work (mostly to clean up rust).  It needs the
brake system fixed and the engine brought back to life.  No real
specifics to share on these unfortunately.  And I do believe that the
exhaust system and other parts need examination/replacement.



Please let us know if anymore info would be helpful and we'll try to
round it up for you.  Thank you.



Sincerely,

Dave Campbell
