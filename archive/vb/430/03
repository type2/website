Hi Troy,

Thanks for keeping this list alive, etc. etc. etc.

I know you said contact you off-list, but the internet world has changed since I first met your site in 1996'ish... And my job has sure changed. 

What are your thoughts about building a Google Map - or a Facebook Page with a Map? I know that when I have had problems on the road, having access to a Google map with contacts and their locations would have been very helpful.

Thanks,
Conrad
