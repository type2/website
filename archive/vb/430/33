Howdy Campers!

Okay, the USACE Ranger in charge of our area at Mar Twain Lake has confirmed
that they will open the locked "group" campground gates (the site of the BNNTA
event) at around noon on Thursday even though the event doesn't officially
start until noon on Friday thru Monday. They are doing so as a convienence to
any early arrivals, who would otherwise have to go to the main campground
until Friday and then move again over to the event site. We are very grateful
that they are offering to do this for us! Please note that if you take
advantage of this, you are responsible to pay the Rangers for that days
camping fee (I think the daily rate in the main campground is $18 per day).
Your BNNTA event fee (only $30 for the entire holiday weekend) only covers
your camping per vehicle from Friday at noon through Monday at noon. Thursday
evening is your own responsibility, so please pay the Rangers or we might risk
loosing this "early-opening" convienence privilige. Thanks, and drive safely!

Bill
