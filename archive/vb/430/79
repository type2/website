Subject: Re: [VB] Gearing question, quite technical

Hi,

I figured it out. You need to lift both rear wheels and make sure that they 
both turn the same amount. I chalked a mark onto both and cranked the engine 
4 revs and the wheels turned once. Looks like I have about as high a gear 
ratio as one can reasonably obtain in a big nut configuration.

BTW the wheels don't turn evenly due to friction differences and the spider 
gears so I would turn the engine 1 rev and then push the wheel that was 
behind until the chalk marks were even and then turn another rev.

I have everything back together and I'm going out for a spin.

Cheers!!!
Chris




Hi,

As long as I had the rear end of my bus up in the air, I decided to see what
the 4th gear ratio is to the wheels. I have one wheel free and the other is
still on the ground. Does the spider gear do something that will screw up my
measurement? I have 743 crank shaft degrees to make one full revolution of
the wheel.

My trans should have .82 4th, 3.875 r&p and 1.26 reductiongear box for a
ratio of 4.00365:1. So I should really see 4 engine turns to 1 wheel turn.

BTW, the brake shoe broke free after a few good clutch poppings in both 1st
and reverse. I also got the nut loose with the help of a friend and BFH.

TIA
Chris
