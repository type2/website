Subject: hard start

Thought I had it figured out.  Hard start 1600 in a '59 single cab.

new ignition switch, new battery, new rebuilt starter... will start easily
when cold but when hot, turns over briefly and then quits, just as if the
battery is dead.  Generator pumps out 13.95 volts across the battery and the
battery tests as fully charged.

Anyone think one of those hard start relays would help??
