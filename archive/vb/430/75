Subject: RE:Stuck rear brake, need advice

Hi Chris,

 

I think most suggestions offered so far sound good.one last one-if your
parking break was only gently pulled. Try pulling it hard, then
realeasing.this along with the other thoughts might help loosen it up.

 

Also, is there a way to jack up the rear end and slowly move the bus
backwards by pushing it? Then you wouldn't have the worry of smashing the
front of the bus.
