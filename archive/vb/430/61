Looking at the diagram here:

It looks like the fuse does not supply power to the lighting circuit, 
but that the power to the lights does go through the connection on 
the hot side of the fuse.

My first thought is that those push on connectors carrying power to 
the lights might be loose or have corrosion and that the current 
going through them is heating them up and heating up the fuse, 
causing it to blow at much lower current than it normally would.

I would get in the fuse panel and check connections for being tight and clean.
