Subject: Re: [VB] blown fuses

Update:
I just reread the description and realize I had missed that the bus 
is dead when that fuse is blown.

My updated diagnosis it that someone swapped around the red wires on 
that fuse so that the power going to the ignition and start circuits 
is going through the fuse when it should not be. It should just be 
using one side of the fuse connection as a junction point. In order 
to fix it, you'll need to reference the diagram and try to figure out 
which wire is which. Those little numbers next to the wires indicate 
diameter and may be helpful in determining the correct placement of 
the wires.

Looking at the diagram here:

It looks like the fuse does not supply power to the lighting circuit, 
but that the power to the lights does go through the connection on 
the hot side of the fuse.

My first thought is that those push on connectors carrying power to 
the lights might be loose or have corrosion and that the current 
going through them is heating them up and heating up the fuse, 
causing it to blow at much lower current than it normally would.

I would get in the fuse panel and check connections for being tight and clean.
