Subject: blown fuses

my girlfriend has a nice 66 westy that has been converted to 12v.  it runs and drives like a dream, with one irritating problem - it blows the fuse that is furthest right in the fuse panel. it only happens when she uses the headlights, there is actually a smell that occurs leading up to the blow...  when the fuse blows, the bus is basically dead until the fuse is replaced. nothing works....no lights, no starter, nada.  

any suggestions?  all the grounds and contacts have been cleaned. seems to me there is too much on that fuse???
