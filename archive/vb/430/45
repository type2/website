I'd put in a standard lighter socket. You can get nice ones from mid-80's BMW's at the salvage yard. They have an optional light too. 
USB chargers fit as will inflating pumps, Pep boys pathetic defrosters, fans, spotlights and more 12v accessories. It'll only be a lighter if you keep a push in cig lighter. Fuse it properly!
