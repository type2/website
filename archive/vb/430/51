Subject: baby seat lower anchors

With baby #1 due any day now, I'm trying to determine if there is a way to
retrofit seatbelts, or lower anchors for a baby seat in my bus.

 

I imagine you must be able to buy these anchors, and install them
anywhere-as long as they are anchored to something really strong. I just
can't seem to even find them on the net.

 

Any ideas on retro-fitting this stuff?

 

Thanks,
