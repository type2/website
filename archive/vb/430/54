Subject: RE:USB Port

Thanks for all the tips.sounds like cigarette lighter adaptor is the way to
go. 

 

I have gotten a cigarette lighter port from my FLAPS, with a mounting
bracket. I'm going to try to mount this in a somewhat stealth location under
dash. Then I'll insert a USB adaptor and should be good to go.

 

I have already added a radio to my bus, and am starting to worry about too
many things plugged into the fuse box. In my single cab I mounted a 'barrier
block' and ran one feed to this from my fuse box. I think I'll do the same
with my '65. 

 

I'll post some pics when I get it set up..maybe this weekend.
