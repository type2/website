Thanks for all the tips. I  really liked the "Old Bus Review", unfortunately
I never subscribed to it. I am guessing it no longer exists?

 

I think the autors idea on installing belts is great, except my wife says
the kid has to be in the back seat. This info is definitely a starting
point, that along with the other posts. 

 

I think I'll be doing this over the winter-when I take my bus off the road.
Maybe sooner.if I can find the time.
