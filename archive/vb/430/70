I would second that.  I would also take a BFH and rap the hell out of it
first, on the drum face and circumference with the wheel off.  You won't hurt
anything, and often it will dislodge it.  This happens a lot in damp
climates.  Flash rust, rusts the shoes to the drum tighter than hell, but a
little impact often can free them up.

My opinion:  Jack up the wheel with
a floor jack and push your bus backwards 8 feet.  THEN try driving forward by
revving and popping the clutch.
