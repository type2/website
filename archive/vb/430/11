 Hi Harry,
Not hard with engine out or using the proper VW too with engine in, or even
with a tap that just fits the ID of the bushing you can tug it out.
Or you can install a auto stick (12 volt ones are fairly easy to get, 6 volt
models are near impossible) starter that uses 2 bushings inside itself.
E&B


how hard is it  to get the bushing out of the tranny??
