Subject: Re: [VB] baby seat lower anchors

Yeah, loads of people have done this.

I fitted lapbelts to the read, anchored them through the angled bulkhead 
with 1/8" think square plates holding the bolts.  I used a lap belt with 
a new-born baby carried, using the belt to hold in the seat base so you 
can click the baby carrier in and out.

When the kids get bigger you want to go for 3 point belts for their 
booster seats in the back, so it will mean either welding in the top 
plates for the top mount (you'll still have the lower holes from the lap 
belts) or one bus I had just had a big bolt (a proper but older belt 
fitting kit) through the body - maybe not the nicest option.

I've got a 59 westy on the way so I plan to do the job properly by 
fitting plates.

I read that with the 3 point, the shoulder belt needs to anchor higher 
than the level of the wearers shoulder for safety.
