Hi Chris,

My understanding is that they get stuck when rust builds up between
the side of the shoe and the drum or the brake backing plate. After a
month, it can't be that much rust and it should only take a moderate
amount of force to move it. Unfortunately, the parking brake cable is
only good for pulling and not so good at pushing.

So I would tap the drum with a hammer for a few minutes, then try
backing up again. You might also try poking a screwdriver through the
inspection holes, point it at offending shoe and give a few light
taps. Don't know if the last suggestion is actually possible, it's
just an idea.
