Figure for a newbie half hour to hour each screw.  So sixteen hours max.

Other way is to put a nut over the broken screw, and weld the nut to the
broken off fastener.  The sudden heat will swell up the screw, and turn the
rust from a plating to a layer of dust, loosening the screw remains.  Soaking
with water right after welding helps even more to shock the rust into dust.
