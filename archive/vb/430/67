Stan Wohlfarth organizes the show, and it is usually pretty good. Raffle
tons of stuff, seems like I win every time, a nice spot to see some nice
restorations, and daily drivers and everything in-between. It is geared
towards Buses, but they let other VW's in.

 

I'm bringing my '65 ez-camper-which has transformed from daily driver to
weekend excursion machine.

 

Hope to see some other list members there.
