Attach (staple?) a nylon "wall" to lip of bed board and sew a continuous 
loop at the top to hold nylon rope or even a bungee cord that you fasten 
to the arms for above bed or to upper bed/sides of upper arms- no more 
lost pillows.  In our 78 a long time ago I did this for the lower bed 
using thicker nylon (flag material) and a chain run through upper loop 
to large eyebolts I put in the frame at each side of upper bed.  I used 
a chain and heavy sewn loop fastened to bed brackets under seatbed also. 
This protects the sleeping rear passenger from rocketing forward in the 
event of a sudden stop.
