Be careful and go slow when you drill out those bolts.  Work your way up through a few ever-larger holes before you're ready to tap out the threads, or you could end up seizing and busting off the end of an even harder drill bit in the bolt as well.  BTDT on my DC.  Then I had to send out for a couple of pricey specialty drill bits (I think they were diamond coated) from McMaster Carr to drill out the first drill bit too.

I have a 1961 Single cab.  The bolts for the dropgates are broken inside the
body where then bolt on/in.
How do I get them out? What is the process? What tools to I need?
I don't want to ruin my SC
