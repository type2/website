Subject: How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive: A Manual of Step by Step

Hello All,

I own 2 copies of How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive: A Manual of Step by
Step Procedures for the Complete Idiot. One copy is for the shop and get
greasy and the other is my reference manual.  However there are so many
times I need one when I'm on the road. Does anyone have or know how to get
the book on pdf?

If you need proof that I own it...let me know if you need a sentence from
the book

Thank you,
Mike
