Subject: Re: [VB] Single Cab: DROPGATES broken bolts

I second all of Clara's points. Be patient and careful. Breaking a  
drill off in the broken bolt creates a big job. If you can drill a  
big enough hole to begin to cut the threads on the broken bolt and  
hole, penetrating oil can help free the bolt. You then can use a  
small punch or chisel  to try and spin the broken bolt out. Yah,  
don't stick an "easy out" in the hole!
