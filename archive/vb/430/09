Yes, I hated putting one on my '65 Westy, but it just makes life easier,
40 something years of old wiring will do that. I actually use horn
relays out of a Scirocco or Rabbit, easy to wire, Ronnie has a link at
Old Volks.

Thought I had it figured out.  Hard start 1600 in a '59 single cab.

new ignition switch, new battery, new rebuilt starter... will start
easily
when cold but when hot, turns over briefly and then quits, just as if
the
battery is dead.  Generator pumps out 13.95 volts across the battery and
the
battery tests as fully charged.

Anyone think one of those hard start relays would help??
