Good lord!  PLEASE KILL THIS THREAD.  NOW.

You -WILL- get much better satisfaction if you email the list admin email 
addresses directly as you've been instructed to many many times over the 
past -how- many years now?

type2-admin(-at-)type2.com
vintagebus-admin(-at-)type2.com

And, THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN FIXED.  It's just a frigging bounce.  Addresses 
subscribed to the list (may have even been real people once!) became bad. 
The email server software on the other end is a piece of shit and responds 
to the From: address, instead of the envelope sender (mail from: during 
the SMTP transaction - which for list email is a specially formated 
address with software on the other end to handle bounce detection). 
That's it.

It would have been addressed much much much much sooner if people had 
emailed the admin addresses, since lets face it - we don't post as much as 
we used to, so we don't see what you see.   We also don't read the lists 
as much as we used to, so on-list discussion is kind of wasted.  Oh, and 
off topic, in case you forgot about that.

Instead, I found it last weekend while I was at a funeral.  I fixed it, or 
so I thought, but while I rejected the addresses from being able to 
resubscribe, I actually failed to -unsubscribe- the addresses.

So. THE END.
