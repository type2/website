Unfortunately we can't afford to offer the same discount online. It's much
cheaper for us to process an order over-the-counter (many people pay cash so
no credit card transaction fees, plus we save the the labor and materials
involved in packing/shipping/labeling the order).  Of course there is always
your 5% List Member discount, which is ongoing on most orders over $50. 

However, I can give you this pointer - many (but not all) of the Warehouse
Sale items also go online, on the Bus Depot Outlet page -
http://busdepot.com/outlet.jsp .  Mid to late September is the best time all
year to shop the Outlet. The online Outlet selection ramps up gradually
throughout September, and peaks during the week or so leading to the Oct. 1
Warehouse Sale, as many items pulled from regular stock for the upcoming
Warehouse Sale are also posted online to the Outlet. Then the online
selection shrinks considerably right after the Warehouse Sale, when items
sold during the Sale are removed. While the Warehouse Sale discounts can be
somewhat higher (due in part to the coupon linked above), the online Outlet
discounts are still as high as 80% ... and you get first crack at the items
before the Warehouse Sale even starts.
