Subject: Re: [VB] hard start

Hi,

Is there a way to install the starter bushing without pulling the engine?
I had a starter bushing go out once and since the armature of the motor was 
off center, it rubbed against the stator and couldn't turn. Had hard 
starting for quite a while before the whole thing gave up and I had to push 
start.
