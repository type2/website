Subject: RE: [VB] high mileage engines

Hi Ronnie,
Interesting question.  When you see a split window bus for sale, or in a
magazine article that says it has 78K original miles, the questions as to
how long it takes you to put 100K on an engine is an interesting one.

I currently drive my 67 Sundial about 8 miles rt every day to work.  Living
in So Cal, I go to a lot of shows, Pomona, etc, and still drive what is
considered low mileage.

I write down the date, mileage and number of gallons of gas to fill up my
bus, (in fact all my busses and bugs) each time I fill up.  I have done this
since getting my first bug.  I also write down on the same note pad each
time I do the valves, change the oil, plugs, points, rotate the tires,
everything.  Keeps me in the habit of checking to see if it's time to change
my oil, or adjust the valves, or whatever.  Although I don't plan to sell
any of my cars right now, it's also a good record to show to a prospective
buyer that you have taken care of the maintenance of your car regularly.

Anyway, I know you're collecting a lot of data about engines, longevity,
etc.  Any plans to publish your findings.

Keep up the good work.

Ed
