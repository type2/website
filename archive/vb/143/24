Fellow campers unite! I too could care less about
Panels or Deluxes. As far as i'm concerned they either
have too many windows or not enough. Plus they don't
have any wood in them! What's up with that? Are they
VW's or what. Bottom line is it's your stuff,
cut and paste if you want, especially if you can get a
Westy closer to being finished. 
Maybe you could use
the panels you cut from the donor to scape off some of
that rolled on
paint while you were at it! :)
