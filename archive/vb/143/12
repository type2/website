hey all, I thought I would share this.
Yesterday I pulled in to my local dealership with my 65 singlecab. I =
parked up front where everyone could see me, breaking the monotony of an =
endless sea of shiny new cars. The young "professional" looking couple =
that was standing in front of the parking space took one glance at the =
truck and with a look of confusion and disgust on their faces headed for =
the security of the showroom. As I started inside the salesman next to =
me points at the truck and says" you know they are coming out with those =
again in a few years" This time to look of disgust and confusion was on =
my face. "yea I know" I replied, "but they aint gonna be like that, and =
I wouldn't trade in that", pointing at my truck" ,for one of the new =
ones".=20
