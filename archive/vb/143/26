Subject: Bus in wrecking yard

I was in southern Calif the past 3 days and found a 64 or 65 kombi in the Pick
a Part on Peck Rd in Monrovia. If anyone in the area needs sheet metal, both
cargo doors, the rear hatch, or the nose with front glass.....go get it! The
rear corners are pretty decent.
That is about all that is left besides the front beam and transaxle
w/reduction boxes.
I believe it to be a 64 or 65 because it has the floor mounted high beam
switch. [66/67 used the TS switch] All the M code plates are gone and the vin
has been cut out of the right rear sheet metal metal. Gone also is the drivers
dogleg and drivers floor section. Gone also is the edge of the cargo opening,
6" in and the whole length [darn....I needed that!]
It was a kombi with 6 pop outs [they are gone]. Non-walkthru with no rear
heater log. Strange thing is: it appeared to have been a factory two-tone
velvet? green bottom/white top half. I thought kombis were single paint color?
Never appeared to have had a headliner or interior panels in the rear.
