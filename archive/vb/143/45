It's been said before... Non-synthetic oils start life 
at their thinnest. So to get a 10w40 they start with 
single weight 10 and mix in additives that make it 
thicker at higher temperatures. When exposed to the high 
heat in an AC engine these additives break down and stop 
doing their job at higher heat. You end up with thin, 
10w oil trying to keep pressure in the bearings. 

I guess you could test this theory by heating up some 
unused multi weight oil on a hot plate to see how it 
thickens. Do the same with used oil of the same 
type and same quantity. All you need is a couple of tin 
cans, hot plate, thermometer, and two more tin cans with 
holes the same diameter. Gee whiz Mr. Science!
