actually I've used 20/50 a lot and been happy.  but 10/40 is too thin for the 
90s F.
or in your temps even use 40wt.  
40 is thicker than 20/50 is thicker than 30wt is thicker than 10/40
I base that on comparing oil pressure readings using different wt oil in the 
same motor.

I also suspect that single weight is more resistant to thermal breakdown.

no- it is normal for oil the get thinner as the engine warms up- like butter 
melting.
ya- maybe check your pump, but you are running a thin oil for summer so why 
not use a thicker oil first and see how that changes things.  If you do want 
to investigate the pump- spec it with a feeler guage to see how much play is 
in the old one, and also in the new one.

FWIW aircooleds cool better in humidity that in the dry .  Heat transfers 
better with the water.  Like steam will burn you worse than hot dry air.   
Wrapping a towel around a sack of ice and bungeeing it in place in the engine 
bay in spare battery area works to cool engine in hot dry climates.   (just 
dont want the plastic bag or towel getting sucked into the fan)
