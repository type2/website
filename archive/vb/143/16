It's the humidity, not the heat.  Right!

I'm getting roughly the same information from an electrical engineer 
where I work.  Will work on getting a VOM on it to see how accurate
everything is.

I believe I have 10W40 in there now.  I know. I know.  Single weight
only is recommended.  I've been running 20W50 Castrol in my wasserboxer
for 184000 miles and may change the bus to that and check for
improvement in oil pressure.  I have noticed that it starts out OK
(30-40 psi) for the first 10 miles, then drops off as I hit operating
temperature.  Sounds like the dreaded "viscosity breakdown" to me.

Both springs and plungers are stock.  One long spring, one short.  One
grooved plunger, one not grooved.  All are used, however, and I may just
splurge for a new set.  I see Wolfgang Intl has a set.  I went through
my parts stash last night and found a new oil pump, still in bag, which
leads me to think I didn't put a new one in last fall when I rebuilt the
engine.
