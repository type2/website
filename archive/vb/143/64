Probable chain of events:

Nice bus stolen.
Crook buys parts bus and cut plates out of it to transfer to stolen bus.
Crook abandons parts bus on street.
Cops impound parts bus for lack of license plates.
Impound yard sells hulk to wrecking yard.
Listee sees bus and starts this thread...

End result, crook now has completely clean bus, unless someone
notices that a structural M-code (walkthrough, etc.) doesn't match the
way the bus is put together.
The evidence is hauled away and crushed, courtesy of John Law.
Owner of stolen bus is out of luck.

Kind of makes me want to engrave the VIN on every part of my bus!
