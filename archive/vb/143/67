The new bus will suck.
As the new beetle reflects a corporate desire to cash in on a product that
they privately disown, so will the new bus suck the identity out of our
cherished aircooled buses in a cynical attempt to profit for a group which,
at every attempt expresses distaste for our hobby and culture.
Ever wave at someone in a new beetle? I always get that "who the hell are
you waving at" look.
Even when I'm driving my new beetle.
They are not us.

John, not to worry. All the major auto manufacturers are going
retro-nostalgic following in the foot steps of Dodge/Chrysler. There will
always be a niche for us as there has been for other REAL collector cars
from other manufacturerers.
