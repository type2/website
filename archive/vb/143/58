Matt, list,

Unless you're hauling huge butter sculptures there's no 
real need to cool everything in a bus. 
I finally have a working prototype of a "cool seat". 
Sewed some vinyl tubing to a removeable seat pad back, 
added some valves and such and plumbed it to a 
submersible 12v pump that's dropped in an ice chest of 
you know what. It does one thing, removes heat from the 
occupant's backs and puts it in the ice chest. My 
commute is only 10 minutes so no long range tests have 
been done yet. The long drive to Jerome will be a good 
test in a month and a half. 

Speaking of vehicles baking in the sun, see 
www.solarcooking.org for plans to build a sun oven that 
will get to 400f with free energy!
