Subject: Re: [VB] 67 tranny swap...again

doesn't it cost about $300 (plus shipping) to get a rebuildt transaxle?    
That is really not a bad deal.

some bug axles will fit the bus, which means lowering the bus (where's yr 
front end?) and losing ground clearance.  enjoy driveways).   I don't think 
the 67 axles fit, though.

Other options:  use the bug center section.   Remove the bug axle tubes and 
axles.   turn the ring gear around to the other side.   Attach bus axles (use 
best FPlates and crown gears ), attach bus axle tubes and RGBoxes.  You will 
now have a bug 4th, which is lower than a bus 4th, so that gives you freeway 
speed issues.

evidently the karmann ghia tranny has a .82 (like bus) 4th, bugs have .82 4th.

What is wrong with your bus's tranny?   Are the RGBoxes okay?  RGBearings- 
jack up the rear of the bus, and see if the rear axle wiggles in the box- 
easier with wheel/drum off- it should not wiggle, or only a hair.   bad 
thunks means you oughta spend a couple hundred bucks on bearings. 
 How bad is the cash flow... I recommend getting a rebuild.   Cause when the 
tranny in my 65 went (popped out of 4th reall bad) I put in a tranny  from a 
67 which howled and popped out of reverse.  so seeinghow long it takes to 
swap it over  make sure it is good the first time.

<< Hello list,
 I've been searching long and hard for an affordable and reliable tranny-axle 
for my 67 (1600 dp), and was curious if the stock 67 bug setup with long
 axles would fit correctly; that is if I coud use the "long axles" on the bus 
and bypass the reduction boxes altogether.  I don't have the resources
 to check the dimensions, so I thought I'd see if anyone could speak from 
experience here.
 Thanks much for your input, and have a good one.
