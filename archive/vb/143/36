Subject: Should I Cut Up A Bus?

    I really would try to avoid cutting it up.   I don't particularly favor 
DD panels- except for the Hausmann's meats delivery van- but they aren't 
making anymore early VWs.   I am sure some one would really love that bus, 
and would take it out of your yard and give you some money.   

So I'd hawk the DD to someone who is more enthusiastic about it and try to 
find the metal elsewhere.    Many parts and pieces of metal can be taken off 
of buses in much poorer condition overall.   I got an excellent nose from a 
bus that in other places was so rusty you could change the brake hoses while 
in the back of the bus.  

It's a bummer when people do hack up a trashed bus, that they leave so much 
to be crushed.  oughta shift rods, hardware, switches, mechanisms, etc.  I 
mean, the vultures oughta pick the bones till the bones are not edible.

talking about needing sheet metal, the area behind the cargo doors and 
forward of the corner on my 61 is bad.   outies vents, flat wheel well.   
piece the door bolts to is loose from the floor.    25 yo bondo over dents. ( 
I guess I could cut that off the 59 westy...... but hoping I could get it off 
a dead bus )

Also I have a bunch of sheet metal- corners, early noses, tops of side window 
surrounds to fix the lower parts, pop out hinges, misc

why don't you try putting out a list of the parts you need for your westy 
projects?
