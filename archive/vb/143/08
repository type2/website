Subject: Radio shack radio wanted

Did anyone happen to buy on of the Optimus radios that fit right into
the dash without cutting, and now doesn't want it anymore?  It appears
as though they are discontinued in the U.S.., are only available new in
Egypt now!

Please pmail me to work out cash/trade if you have a good working one to
get rid of.

TIA
