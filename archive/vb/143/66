Subject: Re: [VB] RE: new bus

The new bus will suck.
As the new beetle reflects a corporate desire to cash in on a product that
they privately disown, so will the new bus suck the identity out of our
cherished aircooled buses in a cynical attempt to profit for a group which,
at every attempt expresses distaste for our hobby and culture.
Ever wave at someone in a new beetle? I always get that "who the hell are
you waving at" look.
Even when I'm driving my new beetle.
They are not us.
