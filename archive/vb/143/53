I would love to have an effective AC on my bus, (just came in, 96in the
shade and my bus wasn't parked in the shade)

I have one of these and it cools 750sq foot area and never breaks a sweat.

FWIW, a full size city transit bus only has 96,000btu, or about 3 times
what they claim for a VW bus...and they haul around 40-60+ people with the
door constantly opening and closing, it's a wonder they cool at all but
they can handle the load most of the time.

considering the size of bus motors that might not be such a bad idea.
still with that HPBus drop floor I don't know where I would put all the
components, running out of "under the bus"
