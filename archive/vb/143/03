The panels that I got for free each had a log book detailing
the where and when of each fill up and oil change, as well
as trip notes from expeditions all over the western states
and Canada.  Unfortunately, he still only racked up about 50,000
on one and about 60,000 on the other before he gave them to me.

A friend of mine has a '59 standard that he bought in the late
60's or early 70's.  He's racked up at least 700k on the bus -
not on one engine though.  His has also been all over the US,
Canada and Mexico.  It's not pretty,but it runs...
