Subject: !! Buses On The River, August 16-18 


Heard people talking about last year?  Can’t get enough of the breakfast
burritos?  Wondering what to do the third weekend in August?  Pondering the
meaning of life, or at least the theory behind the oil-spot award?
Buses On The River is your solution to all of life’s little pains, sniffles,
sneezes, coughs, aches, stuffy heads, and fevers.  OK, not really… but it’s
darn good medicine, anyway.

The campground manager, L.D., is letting us back; so we’re doing it again for
2002.  Bring your swimsuit, your banjo, your flotation device, and a smile.

If all goes well, we’ll be having a pig roast on Saturday night, and would
appreciate any contributions and pig-eating accessories.  We’re trying our
darndest to pick out just the right pig for roast, but in order for this to
happen, we need an estimate of how many persons will be attending our event, so
that we can figure on the size of our prize-winning squealer.   EMAIL ME IF YOU
PLAN ON ATTENDING, AS I NEED TO HAVE A ROUGH ESTIMATE OF THE ATTENDANCE IN
ORDER TO HAVE A PIG ROAST!  If you don't let me know, then we will NOT be
having a pig roast!  I'm not asking for a committment, just a probability. 
CHECK THE WEBSITE FOR DETAILS on what else to bring!!

We had several folks ask for the availability of a T-Shirt with the design by
T.J. Spivey.  We plan on making those available this year, but with an
inexpensive twist:  We would like everyone to bring your own cotton/ poly blend
shirt for “on-site” screen-printing!  This way, you know the shirt fits, and
you only have to pay for the screen-printing.  If you forget your shirt, or
just don’t want to bring one, we should have just a few classic white shirts
available for purchase, for cheap! ;)  Each screen print will cost only $5.00
each!!

So here’s the low-down:  (copy, paste, print, magnet it to refrigerator)

BUSES ON THE RIVER

along to someone who doesn’t email, then by all means, call me:

For those who haven’t previously attended: We will be camping alongside the
Nolichucky River, at the Nolichucky Gorge Campground in Erwin, TN. This
campground was built by many rafters, kayakers, and hikers hours of fruitful
volunteer efforts. It is positioned within one of the deepest gorges in the
entire Southeast, and has great water accessibility, not to mention literally
bordering the National Forest and the Appalachian Trail. All beverages and all
dogs are WELCOME within the campground, so it is a perfect spot for us! At only
an hour's drive from Asheville and just 2 hours from Knoxville, it makes for
the PERFECT TENNESSEE camping experience! 

If you're into mountain biking, watersports, hiking, eating, fishing, or just
plain doing nothing, then this is the campout for you. The middle of August
will be hot, but the water will be cool and the pines that we will be camping
under will provide ample shade.  Experience August as it ought to be
experienced... with your VW friends, at the Buses On The River campout!

The TN Mechanized looks forward to seeing everybody from last year and MANY
more!
