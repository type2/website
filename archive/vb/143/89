Subject: Harry's amazing seat of cool and my sundial

Well I hope you and Karl fair better this year and good luck on the raffle 
bus.  That seat sounds neat, any pics?  Also what about just putting some 
peltiers under your seat?  You could have a switch to change polarity and 
warm it in the winter.

Side note:  My sundial was picked up in Fresno yersterday and will be in 
Indiana with me on Sunday!  Only took 5 weeks, but I have a question.  The 
person I was storing my bus with was also supposed to cut and polish it 
before it left.  This was not done and I owe him 1 months storage.  Also I 
was told there is a scratch on the drivers door.  I paid him in full for 
painting it, all I owe is July storage.  Should I assess the damage and say 
we are square or pay him?  Could someone explain what I need to do to cut 
and polish or should I just leave it?
