Subject: high mileage engines

  I have a question that has always bothered me. Lots of people talk of
80,000, 100,00 or more miles on there engines, how long did it take to get
there?
  I drive my bus almost everyday, go to over 20 shows a year, each show is a
minimum of 600 miles R T and in 2 1/2 years I have only racked up 43,000
miles (total miles in the 4 years I have been driveling it is 60,000). I
have my 3rd engine in my bus, by choice not necessity and my 2 nd trans,
ready to put the 3rd one in (again out of choice).
  So the question of the week is HOW long did it take to get multiple 1000's
of miles on your buses?
  
  The most driven buses I know of are JP from N M and Bryant from Kansas, J
P is always on the road it seems and Bryant has made numerous C C crossings
in the last year.

  From what I have read and seen, very few Western states people really
drive there buses that much or any long distances on a regular basis

ronnie  just trying to get the facts for documentation purposes

ps. How many of you keep a log on your bus

pps. VW Howard can show you exactly where and how far he has traveled with
fuel records to document milage, I only do this per trip and not on my daily
use
