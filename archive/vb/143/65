Last I heard, the "Westie's" will suck just as bad as
the regular "new-busses" will! (sorry, I just had
too!)
I don't get waves from VW owners out here, so it will
be easy for me to just to ignore them! I'll just
pretend to be overcompensating my steering when they
blow past me in non-buslike fashion.
