I work for a television station in St. Louis, Missouri.  We are picking up
"That 70's Show" in syndication this fall.  We are hosting luncheons for our
clients and we were going to have a limo pick them up, but I thought it
would be more fun, in the spirit of the 70's to rent/lease/borrow a vintage
VW van.  I found your website through Google, so I hope you don't mind me
barging in on you.  I was wondering if you have any knowledge of collectors
in this area?  Just thought I'd try.  Thanks for your time.
