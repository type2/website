Either way, he's got to use at least 12.5 HP to pump 32,000 Btu/hr of
heat around.  It also seems like that if the kit uses 2 16,000 Btu/hr
condensors then the single evaporator needs to be around 32,000 Btu/hr
in order to suck in enough heat to keep the condensors fully occupied.

A/C compressors and alternators are still subject to the laws of
physics.  Bosch suggests that alternators are 50% to 65% efficient
at changing mechanical energy to electrical energy, depending on
speed and load.  They also give typical belt drive efficiencies
of 94 to 97%.

Let's take a 14 V 50 A late-model alternator.  This produces 700 W
of electrical energy.  Therefore, it needs around 1080 to 1400 W
of energy at the alternator pulley, or 1110 to 1490 W of energy
at the crankshaft pulley.  1 HP is 745.7 W, so the alternator
will be pulling 1.5 to 2 HP at full load.

Putting 2 HP into a perfectly efficient A/C system will yield 5,100
Btu/hr of cooling - in reality you will get less.  I do not know what
a reasonable Btu/hr requirement is for automotive air conditioning,
but given that the A/C vendor quoted the original dealer-installed
Bus A/C at 12,000 Btu/hr and is planning his system to handle
32,000 Btu/hr, I would suggest that 5,100 Btu/hr is not enough.
