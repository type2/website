I thought the dual relief setup should get two non-grooved plungers.  Only
the single relief should use the grooved plunger.

I cannot remember where I read/heard that from, but I think it is standard
practice.  Maybe better oil pressure?

You are right about the plungers for dual relief case. Factory is two
straight barrel plungers, interchangable. The single relief case had one
straight barrel plunger from the factory for T-1 and T-2 to 71 on upright
engines. Later it was found by rebuilders that the T-3 slotted plunger
worked a little better in the single relief cases by allowing a little oil
flow earlier. T-3 had the slotted plunger in the European 1300 and later
American 1500 engines because the cooling airflow is completely different.
The slotted plunger should not be used in the dual relief case, that is what
the second relief is for.
