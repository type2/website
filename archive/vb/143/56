In my first post I tried to relate a Bus A/C rating to common home
A/C ratings.  I remembered that I did a calculation a while back on
how much energy it would take to heat up a Bus in winter. 

http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/043445.html

Exactly the same idea can be used to figure out A/C needs.  Please
pay attention to the simplifying assumptions I made in that post,
including but not limited to only heating the back of the Bus, an
empty Bus (no seats or gear or people), no heat loss or gain to
the outside, and no windows.  Basically, assume that the Bus is
surrounded by perfect insulation in the dark as soon as you switch
on the A/C.

In that post, I worked out that it would take around 3130 Btu to
change the temperature of the air and sheet metal in the back of
the Bus by 43 degrees C.  My guesstimate was that doing the whole
Bus would add 15% to 30% - let's be conservative and say 15% or
3600 Btu.  In the original example I was heating the Bus from 
-18 C to 25 C (0 F to 77 F), but the same numbers would apply
for cooling a Bus from 60 C to 17 C (140 F to a chilly 63 F).
In case 140 F sounds like a lot, a little Googling revealed
http://www.marlowesvets.com/newssummer02.htm in which a car
parked in 72 F weather in mid-May 2002 _in the UK_ had an
interior temperature of 137 F.

The Btu needed are directly proportional to the temperature
change, so if you only wanted to cool the Bus to 25 C (77 F),
you can multiply all the Btu numbers by 35/43 or about 0.8.

So, anyway, we're cooling down the Bus and we need 3600 Btu to
do it.  If we had a 3600 Btu/hr A/C, it would take... hey...
1 hour.  A 7200 Btu/hr A/C could do it in 30 minutes.  If you
wanted the Bus to cool off in 10 minutes you'd need an A/C that
could put out 21,600 Btu/hr.  If you only wanted to get it down
to 25 C/77 F, you'd need about 17,600 Btu/hr of A/C output.

I worked out earlier that a perfectly efficient A/C running at
32,000 Btu/hr will need 12.6 hp at the compressor.  So for
the 21,600 Btu/hr (10 minutes to 63 F) you'd need about 8.5 hp
and for 17,600 Btu/hr (10 minutes to 77 F) you'd need about 7 hp.
No air conditioner is perfectly efficient so in reality you'll
need more hp from the engine. 

Again, remember that this is assuming that the external heat
of the sun _stops_ as soon as you turn on the A/C.  It also
assumes no hot and sweaty people heating up the Bus, either.
All of these things will require more output from the A/C.

Hopefully all this shows that the main reason that a vehicle A/C
has to be quite oversized compared to a house A/C is that the
vehicle A/C is expected to do a tougher job (bigger temperature
change) much faster than the house A/C is expected to.  The
5-year-old A/C that's keeping my house cool (~1800 ft^2 single
story in Tulsa, OK) is a 36,000 Btu/hr unit and does a fine job.
The vendor whose message started all this claimed that the original
Bus A/C was 12,000 Btu/hr and his design was 32,000 Btu/hr.

I've been around a couple of newer cars that had WOT cut-outs for
the A/C.  It makes sense that if you have a little engine that
isn't expected to spend much time at all at full throttle, it's
better to trade comfort for performance.

I used to drive an '84 Niss(-at-)n with a 2L FI engine and a 3-speed
auto and factory A/C.  It didn't have an automatic cut-out, but
I soon learned to turn off the A/C myself before trying to pass
on a 2-lane road or when going up a couple of Interstate on-ramps
that went sharply uphill.  I think some of this was due to the
3-speed; a 5-speed stick would have fared a little better. 

My T*y*ta has a 1.5L four, but it handles the A/C just fine.
Running it tends to kill my mileage, though -- I get 45 MPG
instead of 50.  :)
