hey all, I thought I would share this.
Yesterday I pulled in to my local dealership with my 65 singlecab. I parked
up front where everyone could see me, breaking the monotony of an endless
sea of shiny new cars. The young "professional" looking couple that was
standing in front of the parking space took one glance at the truck and with
a look of confusion and disgust on their faces headed for the security of
the showroom. As I started inside the salesman next to me points at the
truck and says" you know they are coming out with those again in a few
years" This time to look of disgust and confusion was on my face. "yea I
know" I replied, "but they aint gonna be like that, and I wouldn't trade in
that", pointing at my truck" ,for one of the new ones". 

later
