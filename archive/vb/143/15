Subject: The Orlando rondevous:  another viewpoint

Yeah,

Yeah, privied info like uh, U.S. Code Section 10987654321, the federal

statutes pertaining to the restoration of VW busses.  Ignorance before
the law is no excuse, and Rachel and I are privy to these laws and
regs.,  Law Librarians we be.  So, before doing anything on your bus,
check with us for the lgality" of it.

I am baaack volks, after a two month absence.  I got to see Rob Kings'
Down Under sweet restoration of his '59, I think it was.  Have to say,
it is both "Legal" and sweet.  He switched it over to right-ahnd drive.

She's  real show car, and he has some trophies to prove it.  What a
sano
job he did with it, and he did it himself.  The paint job is just
immaculate, the upholstery is beautiful, the detail approaches
perfection.  Rob has set his own standard to follow as he begins to
restore the barn door which is up next.  I saw that too, and I didn't
see anything needing to be done on it that he hasn't already mastered
as
evidenced by his '59!  I admire his patience talent and expertise. 
Just
think, in 7 years I hope to be a neighbor of his, at least 6 months
out
of the year. 

I saw tons of busses in Australia, but they were practically all bays,
including a rare bay single cab, I had never seen one before.  I saw
only three splitties, two belonging to Rob and one on the road,
ironically, there in Geelong, with Rob.  We were on oure way back to
his
house from the storage place where his barndoor sits, safe inside,
away
from the elements (except for dust!) awaiting Robs' TLC.  Someday soon
.
. .  And I need to tell you, his wife has a sweet notchback for a
daily
driver.  OTH, to turn either of his busses into a daily driver would
be
a crime agains humanity . . . it it just too far a drive for them.

The visit with Rachel was, as she said, a highlight of the convention
in Orlando for me too.  Sorry Shamu-the-Killer-Whale, you and your
friends just don't cut it!  Orlando in July?  Well, Rachel nearly
drowned trying to find me Friday evening, and we nearly suffocated in
the humidity going to breakfast the next morning.  But the subject of
conversation, . . . predominently bugs and busses, with just a litte
bit
of Library of Congress classification thrown in at the end, made it
all
bareable and worth it.  

I always figured I was a volkswierdo, but really, I am a volks novice.

Volks on this list, including, . . . especially Rachel, are far more
experienced and into the hobby than I.  That means I am lucky in that
I
have lots of people to draw from for advice and volkspertise.  

It is good to be back and on the List.  I am currently pulling extra
wires for a tach, temp and voltage meter before having my Metwiz-made
belly pans welded on.  I just Por-15'd them yesterday.  Then there is
the installation of door rubber, seat re-upholstering, new back lights
(hey Ronnie . . . )  interior kit  I have in hand from
TMI--installation, new rubber where she meets the road . . .  it's
never
done, is it?

Best to all, hope summer is treating your air-cooled's nicely.
Questions ARE coming!

Ahh. beware the librarian and the arcane knowledge to which they are
privy.
