Hi Nicholas,
Definitely, or at least if your 009 wieghts have not been oiled at least
once 
every 3,000 miles they could be stuck and not allowing the distributor to 
advance properly.  If you still think you are sucking air, check your seals 
of the intake manifold, and for any holes in the manifold itself.  Eric&Barb
