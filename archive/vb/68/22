This and even the solid coupler up front sure don't seem like a very 
difficult couple of parts for someone to be machining out of some good 
stainless or something.  I for one would be willing to bay the bigger bucks 
to get good quality parts that I don't have to worry about.  Anyone out there 
agree?
