Ah, the purest have left the building. It was designed to be the peoples
car, easily constructed, and affordable to most everyone. If you want heavy
steel I-beam construction, buy a Kenworth. INMHO

So, Porsche and a bunch of geniuses designed an incredible engine and were
opening the champgne when somebody said "We haven't done anything about how
to make it go zoom zoom, no acelerator." They thought about it for a second
and said "Let Gunter do it" and they all laughed. Gunter was a
booger-picking son of a vice president in marketing. 

That is my theory on why I found this incredible piece of crap where the gas
pedal pushes a rod that pushes a "L" bracket that looks like it came from a
Home Depot and stretches a thin wire that pulls on the carb and make the
engine go zoom.

I had to completly redesign and rebuild the whole assembly with a strong
piece of welded steel and a 1/4" piece of steel rod.

I have found a few other not-well-too-thought-out engineering items, have
you?
