Subject: Scheduling &  mail crash,, dude needing reserve cable brkt?

Ok trying to get my shop scheduling for this year straightened out, for this
year, I need all who are on the waiting list and haven't heard from me
lately to please contact me and confirm your intrest and your spot. Emmet
McGovern your one of those. I will be contacting all who i have phone no.s
on later this afternoon.
Also  i had a major C: drive crash last weekend and can't retrieve my old
mail from last saturday back.(Actually i killed the Celeron desktop i was
using). Mustave been all the uploading to Thom's site, anywho.  So if you
have contacted me lately about parts or something and i haven't responded
please resend or something. ESPECIALLY the dude wanting the reserve brkt off
one of the parts bus , i lost your e-mail and have no idea who you were.
sorry for the band width,, later
