Subject: sighting on Monday

I know this will be trivial, but I ran up behind a brown (I think) split bus
this last monday, MLKday, and tried to have my wife take a picture while I
was trying to change lanes. I am pretty sure it was someone from the list,
but not 100%.
So, if you were in Reno, and there was a maniac in a blue minivan with a
crazy woman trying to take your picture after going thru the spaghetti bowl
south bound, it was me. P-mail me.

BTW, the 2 pictures that she took were not good at all, the sun was behind
you. LOL
