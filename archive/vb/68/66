Subject: Wiring Diagrams


I've just added 162 more wiring diagrams to vintagebus.com,
all of it later stuff, but a lot of you guys have later cars, so...

I haven't had a chance to move them around to their various
categories, but they're usable as-is.

If anyone has diagrams that I'm missing, I'd love to have them!
