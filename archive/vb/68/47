I'm in on it.

Personally, I prefer the vintage look, but I make drivability 
"improvements" like engine, tranny, etc.  Oh, and a CD player.  But
here's the deal, the folks pounding on others for lowering, etc: wouldn't
you rather see a lowered pink and green split parked at the store than a
H*nda or Ch*vy?  All the more power, especially if the bus was going away
forever.  Besides, most mods can be reversed easily, and if they can't,
it would probably take less work to "restore" the bus after the mods have
been done than it would from scratch.  So if non-vintage REALLY bothers
you, just consider that they're keeping it rust free until they sell it
to a vintage nazi.

Amen
