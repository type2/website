   They did that on a budget, people's car you know. Porsche used a solid
steel rod to a bell crank on the back of the fan shroud. They had the
engineering, but just chose not to use it on the VW.

ronnie,  a steel cable has worked fine for me

So, Porsche and a bunch of geniuses designed an incredible engine and were
opening the champgne when somebody said "We haven't done anything about how
to make it go zoom zoom, no acelerator." They thought about it for a second
and said "Let Gunter do it" and they all laughed. Gunter was a
booger-picking son of a vice president in marketing. 

That is my theory on why I found this incredible piece of crap where the gas
pedal pushes a rod that pushes a "L" bracket that looks like it came from a
Home Depot and stretches a thin wire that pulls on the carb and make the
engine go zoom.

I had to completly redesign and rebuild the whole assembly with a strong
piece of welded steel and a 1/4" piece of steel rod.

I have found a few other not-well-too-thought-out engineering items, have
you?
