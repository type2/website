Many thanks to the Lake Havasu bus brothers and sisters for their hard =
work hosting this rag tag bunch. It looked like fewer buses this year, but =
they were spread out wider due to the weird motorcycle track mucking up =
the flat areas. Should have circled closer in that cold wind! I was =
heartened by the young people attending and pitching in. Britt's daughter, =
the ABC's Kiki, the kid with the Westy project and others.=20

Miscellany... Scott Fraser gave tours of Jupiter, Mars and the moon under =
that big AZ sky.  Kyle and Evan provided some unforgettable moments, damn =
them.   I brought 3 items to swap, "Minibus" name plates from an old RV,  =
and they were gone in 60 seconds. One was installed on a bus 5 minutes =
later 10 feet away. I'll use the profits toward a warmer sleeping bag! One =
of our neighbors had major engine trouble and was convinced it was because =
they left the oil filler cap off and lost "crankcase pressure". I gathered =
a lot of info from the bay campers for my '79 project. Dutch ovens are =
neat!=20

Yes, I won the engine... and the hmmm-mermm, and the other stuff. The =
engine will go in my stock '65 21W project. I should have it finished =
before BBB VII so it can visit the fatherland. Thanks again Ronnie, John =
Howard, Jon Stanton, Havasu Lou and the rest of the bunch.=20
We didn't get a VB listee picture! Guess we could flip over last year's =
picture, add some more grey and call it good!=20
