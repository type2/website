Hi S,
Exactly!  Otherwise when the axle when it goes up the seam wrinkles up and 
gaps form betwen the sealing surfaces.  At the same time this seam does not 
get too low as to allow tranny oil to leak.  Forgot to mention also we apply 
a thin coating of high temp silicon to these surfaces to give them added 
sealing qualities. VW used a Sealing Compound D 1 a.  Make sure not to 
overtighten the screws/nuts so much as to cause them to pucker the rubber!
