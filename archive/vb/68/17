On the VW Planet I downloaded the brochure for VW Canada's Canadiana camper
kit ('65). Not sure if this is the same as the Kombi Kamper distributed by
the BC dealership mentioned. Starts at this link 4 pages in all.

Also downloaded paperwork for a '67 Westfalia Tourist Delivery in London
with prices/options etc. for Werke #9913, which no longer exists.
