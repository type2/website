i've seen some well-done customizing!  it still makes me feel funny inside,
BUT if the bus was ratty to begin with, why not??? as long as it is back on
the road. shoot, rex's bus is purty custom, not og, and it is NICE!!

now, the folk who take a NICE, easily restorable bus and hack it up (dude,
i'm gonna put this baywindow popup on that 21window sunroof i bought the
other day! got a sawzall?), well, they make me sad.

and the teenager who bought what was it, bus #45? less than 2000 miles on
it? his parents helped him CHOP AND LOWER IT. and one O them titty rags did
up an article about how kewl it was.

that kid, his parents and the mag editors should all be put in a pile of
36hp cases and torched.

it was like taking that all-aluminum racing porsche from the early 30s and
making a lawnmower out of it..............
