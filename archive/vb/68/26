So, Porsche and a bunch of geniuses designed an incredible engine and =
were opening the champgne when somebody said "We haven't done anything =
about how to make it go zoom zoom, no acelerator." They thought about it =
for a second and said "Let Gunter do it" and they all laughed. Gunter =
was a booger-picking son of a vice president in marketing.=20

That is my theory on why I found this incredible piece of crap where the =
gas pedal pushes a rod that pushes a "L" bracket that looks like it came =
from a Home Depot and stretches a thin wire that pulls on the carb and =
make the engine go zoom.

I had to completly redesign and rebuild the whole assembly with a strong =
piece of welded steel and a 1/4" piece of steel rod.

I have found a few other not-well-too-thought-out engineering items, =
have you?
