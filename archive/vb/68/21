Subject: Re: [VB] BBB VI - Thanks!

I would like to second and even third Harry's thanks, but I must also make a 
correction to them.  I don't like taking blame when it is not due and I don't 
like taking credit when it is not due.  BBBVI was strictly a London Bridge 
Bullis production and they did a super job of putting on an excellent 
show/event.  I, Jon Stanton, however cannot claim any credit for anthing in 
this event.  All I did was show up (not even in a VW), drink beer, and hide 
my face when Kyle and Evan went "swimming".  I deserve absolutely no credit 
for anything else.

On the other hand, if you come to Jerome Jamboree and enjoy yourselves, I 
will gladdly accept any and all praise and/or thanks for helping put on that 
event, thank you very much!! :).
