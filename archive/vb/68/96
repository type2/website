yes, that is exactly what it means, pointing down so you can see the screw 
heads and use a screwdriver on them easily.  

It is possible to orient the screws when putting the boots on with the engine 
out, so it is really awkward to undo them with engine in.  actually, as you 
can cut the boots off, it is more important to put the hose clamp screw heads 
so you can access them easily, in case you don't want to pull the motor next 
time.
