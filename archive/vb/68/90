Subject: Re: [VB] Changing axle boots

i find it easy to replace the axle boots on the bus, engine in, wheels on
the ground. a bus with stock ride height is easy to crawl under to do the
job. this also eliminates the need to preload the axles. it can be a little
bit more of a pain if the hot air tubes are there, but not usually. i just
did one, on the car, on the ground in 15 minutes last week. that included
removing the old one and cleaning the axle tube and the flange on the
tranny. it is a grimy car, so don't think it was trailer queen. i try to
align the seam with the rear upper side nut on the flange (on each side
respectively). 
now a lowered bus or a bug/ghia is a different story altogether......
i'm not sure what is meant by "screw heads facing down", but i find that
installing the boots with the screws pointing down (being able to see the
nuts if laying under the car) makes it easier to get a stubby screwdriver
in there should the need arise to tighten them, which i can't recollect
being an issue. they tend to rust themselves in place fairly quickly. plus
the sealing componud and the crush of the rubber usually holds the screws
fairly well. i sometimes take a paint pen and put a dab of paint on the
screws to help prevent them from loosening. do not overtighten them
regardless.
