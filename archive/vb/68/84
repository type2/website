Checker auto parts has the old style still in stock, 69.95 yes I am not
kidding. I offered them 2 new versions for 1 old version they had 10, but
couldn't due to inventory control and warranty issues.

ok, we're talking early style throwout bearing, 60-70 style.
can anyone tell me where to get or how to make the special grease for
inside the throwout bearing? (sachs brand)
i was thinking maybe bosch "points" grease mixed with graphite powder.
mine is starting to make the growl, and i'd like to fix it before it locks
up.
i refuse to use the "new improved" sachs style with the plastic plugs for
the clips (yeah, great design there!), and i won't use a brazilian or
chinese one without having a gun to my head.
anyone have a source for a german one, the older version, of this throwout
bearing?
