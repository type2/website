Subject:  RE: [VB] Friends don't let friends shift with sh*t parts..

I think you'll find that even the can-type coupler
acts as a damper - it's actually made in two parts.  I don't think
you'd be all that happy with a solid one-piece
replacement .... it wouldn't break but it would 
be noisy and vibrate.  

The early couplers with
the rubber block between the two metal end pieces
are much better than the two piece can type
in reducing noise and vibration  (but suffered
from the rubber failing.......).  I run an original early coupler on my
bus and its quiet and smooth shifting (and I always carry
a can-type spare ready for when it fails...)


Anyway, I don't anyone would be happy with a solid
one piece coupler.  You'd need to make the two ends and insert a rubber
block in between (like the early couplers)......something
like this should hold up if made with modern material and bonding
methods?

p.s. stainless also has a 'grain'.  It won't rust
but isn't necessarily stronger!  You never see stainless
structural fasteners in aircraft for this reason - they're
prone to shearing across the grain.....
