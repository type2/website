Subject: BBB and back

Hi everybody,
I want to say thanks to all who made BBB such a splendid event. And
wow the Ratwagen is now a trophy bus. Not one of your best of show or
such, bus won the Uncle Jerry Jess Award, I guess for being a scruffy
bus that won't quit. Trophy bus, nonetheless.
Thanks too to those who helped with my troubled friend (girl in the
cop car), and I say I am sorry to those she inconvenienced. I wish I
could say she was better. More running away, more trips in the cop
cars, jumping out of the bus at speed, trip in an ambulance, emergency
room, two mental health hospitals, my trip home was a nightmare. It
took me 36 sleepless hours to get maybe 800 miles, no fault of the
bus.
The speedo cable is broken and the gas gauge doesn't really work so I
shut off the dash lights and kind of enjoyed it in an unexpected way.
It was similar to the way the outdoors at night seems much more
expansive without a campfire than with. Maybe I was making too much of
this, but I felt a sense of daring and liberty driving the bus through
the night without any instrumentation.
I won a lot of odd stuff in the raffle. Many thumbs up on Gabe the
locksmith's little keyring sized church key, But those aluminum valve
covers, are they mainly just for show or is there any real benefit to
going to the trouble of installing them? I won a set of bay window
door and window seals, I guess that must be good stuff because people
immediately wanted to buy it from me. Sorry volks, I just can't wheel
and deal that fast. Actually I am hoping I can swap it for splitty
rubber because...
