Ed,

I got the Dark Grey powdercoat, with metallic flake.  Imagine the whole rack
dipped in almost a plastic coating.  It has a sheen to it.  I was expecting
more of a flat finish.  Very impressed.

$425.00 Delivered by Freight truck to FL all the way from WA, where Tom
lives.

There you have it!  Tom should be charging more for these racks!  They are
better than any other rack I have seen.
