Hi Rex,
For us it is by turning the engine by hand and setting the crank pulley and 
distributor to TDC or as close as one can.  Make sure #1 valves are closed 
(Valve lash open on both valves.).  Then remove #1 spark plug and with a 
screw driver feel the top of that piston while rotating the crank back and 
forth to find TDC of the piston.  This seems to be about a 3 to 4 degree area 
where the piston does not move, figure TDC itself is in the center of this.
  Same can be done on #2 or 4 cylinders for your 180 degree mark.
We have a degree pulley we have already blueprinted for this purpose only.
