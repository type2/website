You all are driving around in total pieces of sh*t since I know that thing
you have with four wheels and a VW symbol riveted to the front end that you
call a *bus* is not absolutely ALL OG...


okokok, I'm laughin here... I think a new list member was wondering recently
just what NOT to post up to this list unless they want to unleash the
turbulence that this list can experience... now he knows :-)

To appreciate each *project* is to appreciate the great diversity that we
all can enjoy in this hobby.
