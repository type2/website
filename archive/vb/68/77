I've looked in the Bently on how to determine the order of shims.  How's =
other folks doing this detemination without the VW Tool?  Will a simple =
metal straight edge work, keeping it flat against the bottom one and =
measuring from straight edge to arm on top?  Also can Shims be bought =
from folks like Ronnie?  I'm pretty sure I only has a total of 6 in =
there and the Bently refers to using 8 per Pin.

While I'm at it; Is there a difference in the Link Pins?  Top veruses =
bottom?

Thanks
Dave
