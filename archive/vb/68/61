I couldn't agree more! I too find a Barndoor rather
bland and find myself losing them in Detroits fields
on minivans. Especially the horribly dull chestnut
brown and sealing wax red deluxe. A camper as well
cannot come close to giving anyone a sense of
adventure. Seeing one is as unmoving as spotting a
Winnebago on I5. A stock Kombi, Panel, Single or
Doublecab is often overlooked as it blends in with
it's american counterparts hauling goods to and from
it's many destinations.
 I think you underestimate the Bus. It has plenty of
personality on it's own but don't think it needs YOU
to help it find itself.
