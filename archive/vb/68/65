fair enough--to each his own. i guess i'll go outside, sit on a lawn chair,
drinking a spaten, watching the sunset over the yard full of boring
original vehicles (56 euro 'vert bug, 61 flipseat westy, 67 hardtop deluxe,
65 ghia, 59 hatchtop westy, 62 dd panel), wishing and hoping for the chrome
fairy to come and bless me.

hey ronnie, where was the heat in havasu? it's warmer here on the coast!
