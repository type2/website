Subject: Re: [VB] Split in Annapolis MD area <cheap>

Hey, I live in annapolis and have been on the lookout
for a split for a while and that price range sounds
right.... buuut, there is definately NOT a foot of
snow here and I will be in contact to see what I can
do about possibly taking on a new project. thank you,
and yes...pleeaase send me the contact info before
Dicks Autohaus (you'd understand the rush if you knew
the area) gets a hold on it. 
     sincerely,
        jd wilson III
