Subject: BBBVI Complaint

I have a BBB VI complaint - I purchased a Type 1 parts manual in the swaps
and while perusing the "Body" section, I found some porn.

Family event?  NOT!

The porn has VW content, though, so I am ready to forgive the BBB VI
organizers, provided this happens again, preferably every year.

;)
