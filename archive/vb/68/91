<< ok, we're talking early style throwout bearing, 60-70 style.
 can anyone tell me where to get or how to make the special grease for
 inside the throwout bearing? (sachs brand)
 i was thinking maybe bosch "points" grease mixed with graphite powder.
 mine is starting to make the growl, and i'd like to fix it before it locks
 up.

I once took one apart and regresed it with some sort of thickish wheel 
bearing grease he had around, and turned out that was much thicker than the 
OG grease, at least it was harder to turn.  I was in my friends garage when 
he was working on his 70 (i know its a bay, but same TO bearing) and i 
believe it went into his bus and the motor in and he still drives it I guess 
it worked, at least he never called me up and told me I messed it up.  So I 
wouldn't use extra thick grease.  hm, sorry for the lack of detail, but 
that's my 2 cents
