> Just wanted to let Ronnie and Jon and Rachel, etc. know that the Utah Guys
> made it back to SLC from Lake Havasu Monday evening in spite of an engine
> semi-meltdown! 
> 
> Once again we had a great time and enjoyed getting together w/ the many
> listees and others in attendance.  I posted some of the more interesting jpegs
> on The Planet.  Look for you or your bus, family, etc. under BBB 2002.
> 
> Thanks again to Ronnie for letting us use his Shop outside area for retorquing
> the heads on the 60 DC which allowed us to make it home without pulling the
> engine.  Only used 3 quarts of oil between Las Wages and SLC (420 miles) from
> the pushrod tube leak!  Also thanks to Denise Howard for retrieving me from
> BFE when the 63 DC died outside the Campground on the way in on Friday night.
> The brushes in my 1.5 year old rebuilt generator died earlier in the day, and
> after the 87 mile detour thru Parker, Arizona, I had to turn the lights on
> when it got pitch dark, and the battery went slowly dead before completely
> dying on the island in Lake Havasu!
> 
> Other than the 2 lost hubcaps, the shop rag fire under the 60 DC, the shredded
> generator belt and slight overheating and subsequent tow job to Ronnie's from
> west of Needles, we had an uneventful drive!!
> 
> Left a very limited edition bus calendar w/ Ronnie for all his hard work on
> the event, and would like to thank VW Howard, Jim Bell, and all the Havasu
> Bulli's for a wonderful time.  Hope to see everyone at Red Barn/Kelley Park in
> April.
