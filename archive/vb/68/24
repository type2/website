Subject: Split in Annapolis MD area <cheap>

Hi,

I recently bid on a bus on eBay. (I am not the seller.) The selling 
price was $165. I did not win, but the winning bidder is backing out - 
and contacted me to see if I was interested.

All glass, interior items (might even have a middle seat), good front 
bumper (slash w/overriders), engine of questionable state, wheels and 
good tires, some good sheet metal - what a deal you say!

Oh, the catch - it doesn't run <obviously> and is in a swampy truck yard 
(probably under a foot of snow). Has a "rusty front end" probably from 
sitting in said swamp. AND it is in Annapolis MD. In other words, it is 
a parts bus and you gotta pull it outa there.

If you are interested, I'll send you the picture and the seller contact 
info. (Got one response from my last post.)

Disclaimer: This is a VintageBus List special deal only. I am in no way 
affiliated with the seller. I am not making money on this tip. etc. etc. 
etc. SO DON'T FLAME ME!

Conrad
