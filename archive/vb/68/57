it takes alot more research and parts hunting to make a completely stock
bus than a chromed out pimp-mobile. 
i'm not saying that's what the orignal bus in question is. a good job is a
good job, regardless of the style it's done in, but alot of the custom
stuff i've seen at shows over the years leaves alot to be desired in the
way of quality workmanship.
i think custom often means no respect to the vehicle, the secret desire of
the owner to own something other than a vw, and a credit card with a brain
dead owner who thinks vw parts are made in taiwan.

HARSH!!
