Thanks for clarifying that Chris. I was thinking it wouldn't be much

Those numbers are with music on and off. It didn't seem to make much

are new as is the wiper on the slider window.

I have good door seals that I have shimmed to make a good seal all the way
around. The wiper around the top of the front doors fits fairly well also.
