I'm still here too, and I agree, this list has gotten pretty quiet. I've 
been lurking around on the Samba forums over the last few weeks and it 
looks like everybody has moved over there. I guess I'll have to go ahead 
and sign up. I'm probably the only vintage bus list member who hasn't 
joined the Samba.

As long as I'm posting, I'll go ahead and mention my new bus. Back in 
February I scored a major deal. I got a 1965, one-owner, SWR/BG hard top 
Deluxe with all of the original interior still in it and in good shape, 
no big dents, a couple of tiny rust spots, all of the original engine 
stuff came with it, but aftermarket carb and air cleaner is on it right 
now, and (prepare for a shock) - the original window sticker and title. 
I was really blown away when I saw the sticker. The only original stuff 
I didn't get was the radio and the crankcase. Unfortunately the case got 
replaced during a rebuild back in the '80s. One other slight bummer is 
that the back bumper got cut horribly for a beetle muffler. The apron 
didn't get cut, though, so that's good. There's also a little rust in 
the rain gutter on one side - not too much. The bus sat in a barn for 
the last 20 years.

I was going to post this on April 1 to see if anyone would believe me. I 
still have to look under the cover to convince myself it isn't a dream.

I'll post a link to some pictures pretty soon.

I think a couple of you all need to fill us in on some details. There's 
a new member of Team Spatula? How many beers did it take to get Jamie on 
his ass? I see at least three bottles in the picture.
