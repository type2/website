Frank,

The drive on the freeway last night was short and there was too much traffic 
to do a coasting noise test. Will do that some other time. I expect a good 
drop in the noise level.

I also notice that the noise increases as the engine heats up. I guess the 
engine and tranee both get noisier as the fluids heat up.
