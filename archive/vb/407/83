Subject: Vintage Bus roll call

Hi, all--

I'm still here, too--and am enjoying the roll call.

After a long stretch of being busless, I found one while I was still 
living in California: an early '64 mousegray Standard. It had not run 
it many years, and was an utter mechanical mess. I have eventually 
had to replace almost everything, except the 1500 motor (which seems 
good, so far). I now drive it the majority of the time in and around 
Philadelphia--and it's fun to hear all the remarks I get from 
strangers on the street (I'm sure you can imagine).

I have been editing the NEATO newsletter again lately (Old Bus 
Review), which I enjoy doing a lot. I like collecting stories of the 
VW Bus--I guess that's my hobby within a hobby. If anyone here would 
like to contribute, or have free samples of recent editions (pdf), 
I'd love to hear from you!

Tom
