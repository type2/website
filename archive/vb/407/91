Yeah 99% of the VW people I know are through Vintagebus, type2, and really
many from the old vanagon(-at-)lenti days...

although I do spend a couple hours a day on Samba, most of the people I know
over there are just people from the lists who have crossed over there...

And as for VT, I'm sure the Pack will win at *something* in the next year or
two - has to happen someday!
:)
