Would one of those sound card based software spectrum analyzers be
useful?  I futzed around with the demo version of Mac the Scope at one
time, but there are probably free or open source ones out there now.
I'm just wondering if it would be worthwhile to do an analysis by band
in addition to measuring the overall level?  At the very least it
could make data collection easier,  just need a co-pilot with a laptop
and microphone.

Not sure how applicable it is to our bus engines, but I read a paper
on noise in small aircooled diesel engines published by the SAE.  The
authors found that at least combustion noise decreases with increasing
head temps.  I don't recall if they looked at temps and engine
mechanical noise, but they did find that one critical dimension was
the piston pin to rod end clearance, with a greater clearance
resulting in more noise.  I could dig it up if anyone is interested.
There seems to be a lot of recent stuff on noise in direct injection
diesels, but not much on gas engines.
