I found that having a rubber floor mat on the rear floor, and something (foam for the camper bed, or a rubber mat, etc) over the engine helps.? Interior paneling helps.??? A bare?bus is much?noisier than a bus with an interior fitted.

Sorry if that is already there.?? I don't really know how many ?decibels sounds.? However, seals do help with rattling and whistles.?? It can be annoying and time consuming to install them, particulary to get the front door glass felts in nicely, and the doors hung so the door top scraper fits well.?? But it does cut down on whistly drafts, and keeps the bus warmer too.
