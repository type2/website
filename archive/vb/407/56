Subject: Roll Call, (just to let yall know, I'm going to be in John's

I enjoy reading VB, but I just don't have much to say. John, let me know when
you want my SSN and DOB so you can update that will of yours...

That new '65 that John just bought really is a special find, I have had the
opportunity to see, smell, and yes TOUCH it. Don't let him kid you about a
tiny little rust spot that he found with a microscope, It really is a
wonderful bus, and I'm very glad that he was able to get it, I can think of no
one better to own such a jem.

John, where's the pics man...
