Subject: [VB] OCTO & Classic

We'll be camping at BlackStar campgrounds from Thurs. thru Sun.  Joining the
caravan Sat. morning from BlackStar to OCTO, last year it was 42 buses long!
Sunday we'll skip the Classic and head home to AZ.  BlackStar is put on by VTO
and shouldn't be missed!

Lou in Havasu!
