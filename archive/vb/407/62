Hi;  I always read the emails.  Sometimes there is some very useful information.  I own a 63 SC, and a 67 Deluxe, 13 window.  Nothing is running at this point.
   
  I was talking to a guy outside Harbor Freight, I was in my 65 Bug.  He had an older Toyota van.  Do you remember the small ones?  He had removed the gas motor and replaced it with (I think) a Toyota diesel.  He runs it on half diesel and half drain oil from his tractor and his neighbors.  Says it runs great, starts on diesel and then switches.
   
  He said it may be interesting to put a Rabbit diesel in an older VW (Bug or Bus) and run it on the 50/50 mixture.  This is easy to obtain at any place that changes oil.  He has added a prefilter.  We talked about using a 3 cylinder Kubota engine, it speed was not a problem.
   
  This should send the noise level guys through the roof.
   
  What does the Vintage Bus Group think about this?  Has this already been tried?
   
  Anyway, alive and well in North Carolina.  I appreciate this group.
   
  Thanks, Chris
