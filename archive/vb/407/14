Hey Rennie,

Not sure on the engine mounts however they were new when I installed the 
engine 3 years ago. When I pull the engine I will find out whats there and 
replace as needed.

 I forgot if I asked about the mounts before, are they new/German/soft? 
Even
 the aftermarket German ones I've seen look like junk compared to the og
 mounts.
