I'm still here, only I haven't posted anything in a long time.  I had to get another vehicle to drive to work.  Yeah, I went back to work after 10 years of retirement cause my little annuity wouldn't keep up with the cost of living.  That, and the government reduced it by 4K a year cause of a thing called "catch 62".  So I drove my 67 Westy for awhile until the alternator went out and then an electrical short ended everything.  I quit.  That lasted a couple more years but now I've got that job back and Toyota go get me there.  The good thing is I have some dough to fix up my 67 Westy.  I need to rebuild the front end, trans axel, and a couple spare engines.  I live in Oxnard so if anyone has a lead on a front end builder let me know.

There, I've brought you all up to date.  I wouldn't sell my Westy for anything and I get notes left on it all the time wanting to know if I'd sell it.  It's good to see a bit more action on the list now.  I still read it often and clip out the tech stuff by Matt and the others.  Thanks for all the years and the many yet to come.
