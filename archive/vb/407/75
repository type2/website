I'm still lurking about!  My last post was in...uh...January?  I try to 
get in at least 2 posts a year.  :-)

Currently in the tenth month of an on-and-off engine rebuild project 
while I lurk here.  Held up since early May when I discovered that the 
latest part I needed was a -1 camshaft, which is apparently harder to 
find these days than a hen's tooth.
