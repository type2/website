Subject: Re: Best colors

The original color is blue-white over sea-blue, but I have been  
struggling for years as to whether go back because the body will never  
be anywhere near perfect and that dark color show wrinkles. I was  
thinking of switching to Brunswick Blue for the lower. Which I think  
is a pretty color, but kinda gurly. That's when I decided to go with  
the zebra paint job the bus once had. I'll probably use primer this  
summer to see what that will look like.
