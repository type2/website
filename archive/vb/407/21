Hey Tristan,

Good to hear from you once again.
As for software, I  have LabView. A very versatile graphical based language 
for data aquisition and analysis. LabView can work as a chart recorder and 
record data to memory from the audio channel on my PC. I can program filters 
and frequency analysis. My conclusion is that the bulk of the noise is below 
500 hz. I didn't see any definite peaks. Its tough to damp out those low 
frequencies. I need to run the analysis again and take more time to do it 
carefully. I also have an accelerometer that I can place on various panels 
to check for resonances.
