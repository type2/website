Subject: Re: [VB] Noise (once again)

Chris, your resolve is great.

The methodical way you go about this noise is great.
maybe you could remove the engine from the equation for a bit. What i 
mean Is simply move the bus at different speeds without the engine and 
record and analyze the noise.
I guess the only practical way is to drive he bus ,say to 60 mph then 
shut it off and use neutral. If you have the abilty you could remove 
the engine and running gear and tow it.

Maybe it is too extreme or would not give you data for the real 
problem. Lowering noise. The enging run by itself or hooked up to the 
full trans with a load would give other data.

Detroit engines are water cooled and the geometry is very different.

How about subaru engines I think they still make the flat four. Or grab 
someone's 356 or other porche model withe the ac engine.
I was also thinking about the differences in noise of the other VW 
models. I have driven every one years ago but if I remember correctly 
those split wagons were always loud.

Good luck I get to hear those decibels every day.
