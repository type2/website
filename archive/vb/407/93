Subject: Still here

Hi Chris,
Quite a few buses here in Argentina have been converted to diesel, with the most common engine being the vw diesel. Most buses here are that odd Brazilian hybrid of a split bus with a bay front. The difficulty of the diesel conversion lies in finding a decent solution for the radiator. Most people hang it off a nurf bar on the front.
Not very elegant.
I saw one with a side mounted radiator and electric fans in the area behind the left rear wheel well, opposite the battery.
Vw made diesel bays in Brazil,
Am still looking for a pickup version of one...
