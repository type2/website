Ahhh, I knew someone would have the answer.

I was looking at the M-codes on the NEATO site and saw a code for stiffer 
rear bars and thought maybe that was standard for a delivery.

Unfortunately I don't have the M-code sticker for  my bus. It got destroyed 
somewhere along the way in a paint job.

Anyone know the details on getting a birth certificate from Wolfburg?
