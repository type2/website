Hey John,

Those numbers are with music on and off. It didn't seem to make much 
difference. I don't like loud music. The windows were closed. The felt seals 
are new as is the wiper on the slider window.
I have good door seals that I have shimmed to make a good seal all the way 
around. The wiper around the top of the front doors fits fairly well also.
