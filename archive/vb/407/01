Subject: VW Buses 'n Boats Door prizes needed and more info..drawing,

Howdy Y'all,
Just wanted to let everyone know that we will be
having door prize drawings at the 8th Annual VW Buses
'n Boats Camping event near Cincinnati, Ohio on May
16-18.  So, if you have something fun and VW related
you'd like to donate as a door prize let me know!
Also, we will once again be doing a "split-the-pot"
raffle drawing.  Tickets will be $1 each or 6 for $5. 
Half of the pot will go to the drawing winner, the
other half will go to supplement the fire-wood fund
(and you know how we burn through firewood!!).
ALso, the 2 younger Baker Boys have scored another
case of the popular VW Bus Black light candles (as
sold at RRR) that they will be again selling for $3
each or 2 for $5, pix of the candles are here:

Of course you can also find complete details for the
event here:

LET'S GO CAMPING!!!
John Baker
