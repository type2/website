Subject: nose stuff

please keep us informed.  my major ambition is to be able to drive my  
singlecab and listen to the radio when driving 65-70 mph
 
right now it is wind noise that gets me, not vibration.
 
btw when I worked as an engineer for ford motor co in Europe in the 60's,  we 
used dbB for measuring noise levels. they built some beautifully tuned boxes  
that vibrated great at 100 Hz, at 60 mph. the secondary harmonic of an 
in-line  four at 3000 rpm!
 
the prototype of the Lincoln Mercury Capri had over 95 dbB in the rear seat  
at 60 mph! above the threshold of pain, when first built!  Everything went  
off at 100 Hz.
