I still read Vintagebus, mostly.  Other things in life
have gotten in the way of working on vehicles for
the last few years, but I hope to do some work this
summer, probably on my vanagon tho.

'66 standard (running, restored)
'59 panel (running, not restored)
'84 vanagon Westfalia (engine rebuild from hell)
