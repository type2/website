Wow, it's great seeing so many old familiar names coming up that I haven't
seen in years...since the good ol' days...
remember when Uncle Joel used to post the list stats every week? How many
busses there were of each year/model/location/state/etc???
:)
John - definitely post pics of that new bus, and I'm sure I'm not the only
one who would love to see a good scan of the original window sticker...
And hopefully the littlest Spatula will be ready for EveryBus next year.
:)
