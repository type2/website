Howdy,

Today's Sherman's Lagoon comic strip includes a "60's" era VW Bus! Looks 
like Sherman and his turtle buddy Fillmore are about to embark on an 
adventure.

I checked the Sherman's Lagoon web site and it looks like the site is about 
a week behind so unless you have the strip in your paper, you will have to 
wait until next week to see it.
