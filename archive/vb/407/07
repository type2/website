Subject: Noise (once again)

Sorry about the long delay. My bus, the poor thing, has done a lot of 
resting in her garage lately.
I finally got out onto the freeway this evening and fired up the the ol' 
noise meter and drove down to a DHK meet. BTW, mine was the only bus there.

Here are some results:
35-45mph   84-86dbC
55mph   88-92 dbC, not bad. could still use the radio and listen to music.
65mph   94-96dbC, Getting a little loud and music wasn't so good any more.
70mph   95-98dbC couple of 102 db peaks, Music was not so good at all.

Yes, I know, 'A' weighting is more usual, but it cuts off all the low 
frequency stuff which is where the problem lies.

I have great ambitions to remove the motor and do a bang up balance job, but 
life has gotten in the way lately. I'm trying to plan to do it in July. It 
will be interesting to see if there is any noise reduction. I expect there 
will be some.
