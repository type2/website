Subject: VW Buses 'n Boats Event - May 16-18 near Cincinnati, OH

Holy Crap, it's now May!!! Which means it is only 2
weeks until the 8th Annual VW Buses 'n Boats Event in
Morrow, Ohio (near Cincinnati)May 16-18, sponsored by
the Ohio Valley Tribe of the Full Moon Bus Club.  As
always, the event will feature VW camping on the banks
of the beautiful Nationally Designated Scenic Little
Miami RIver.  There will be an optional canoe trip on
the River Saturday morning, followed by a
Cincinnati-Style chili (for those not familiar think
"Skyline" or "Gold Star") dinner on Saturday evening.
I will be crafting the chili, so feel free to bring
some fixins to go with it like:  Spaghetti noodles,
Hot dogs, buns, SHredded cheese, moonshine, or
whatever you like.
All the info you need, including fees and directions
can be found at the website 
http://www.geocities.com/buses_n_boats
Come on out and enjoy some good ole OVT midwestern
hospitality.
See you on the river!!
John Baker
