Subject: Busing Across the Generations

I'm collecting stories and photos for Old Bus Review around the theme 
of "Busing Across the Generations."
This would be anything related to sharing the Busthusiasm between 
"elder" bus-niks and the younger generation. Any and all 
contributions are invited, and everyone who sends material will be 
sent a copy when it's published.

Also, a plug for Old Bus Review: For free samples of recent OBR's. 
send me a message and pdf editions will be sent to you.

Tom
