Subject: Re: [VB] Toe In again. Factory method?

Hi Again, Chris

    That is a little hard to answer, since it depends on what alignment
machine you have in your shop. Volkswagen, and all manufactures for that
matter, ( except maybe "Fo d" all you need to work on them is sledgehammer
and chainsaw, just kidding "Fo d Guy's" don't start ) sends each dealer a
list of minim required tools. A front end machine is on that list, along
with all the other necessary factory tools.
    There are many alignment machines on the market, from the very elaborate
$20,000.00 computerized laser model, to the very basic $500.00 bubble
protractor for Caster/Camber, and a adjustable bar for toe. It is more or
less up to the dealer to chose one.
    If your having your Wife's late model front wheel drive car aligned at a
shop. Ask the Service Advisor for a 4 wheel - thrust centered alignment. If
your car does not have rear adjustments, a 2 wheel - trust centered
alignment is required. For our old plain jane bugs and bus's a bubble
protractor and tape measure will work just fine.
    No, your sway bar has nothing to do with the alignment spec's. Just be
sure and "settle" your suspension before starting your alignment.
    By the way, the chalk and scribe method was learned at
Volkswagen/Porsche' dealership using a bubble and protractor "machine", I
worked at in the sixties. So now you know how old I am! LOL
