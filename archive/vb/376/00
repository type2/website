The aftermarket VDO sending units that I have seen are adjustable two ways.
The float arm is adjustable length and the main arm (that holds the pivot)
is adjustable for length. Is it possible that the sending unit needs to be
adjusted so that FIF (full is full)? Take a look at this link, if your
sending unit looks like this, then it may need to be adjusted for your tank.
