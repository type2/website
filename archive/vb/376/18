Subject: Re: [VB] Installing 40hp Muffler and Heater Boxes

are you installing the 40hp muffler on a 40hp engine?

I am installing a stock 40hp muffler in a bus that I am desperately
trying to get on the road. The engine is in and the heater boxes are
bolted on. When I go to put the muffler on, it doesn't line up. Do I
need to fit it all together without tightening anything first?
