Hi Eddie,
Kind of hard to tell from here, without an interior.  The best way to  tell 
would be to find a Sundial in your area and see if the  cabinet mounting screw 
holes in the body are the same.    Suggest you keep the hole in the roof and 
replace the vent.  That really  does help keep the interior cooler in hot 
weather.
