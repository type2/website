Subject: Parker Arizona Construction

 The complete main street ( California Ave. ) is torn up from one end to the
other. It has been taking people about a half hour to get through town worst
case. When you leave Parker heading to LHC Hwy 95 is under construction all
the way to Osborn wash ( about 5 miles or so ), after that it's clear. This
info was told to me last night by someone who had driven thru on Tuesday to
LHC.  See you in Havasu, hope everyone has a safe drive.
