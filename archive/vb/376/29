I had a 71 tank installed into my 64DD. Be sure to seal off the breather 
tube at the top. Be sure to obtain the filler spout and hose from the late 
model donor.  I also took the straps off the donor bus with the felted pads. 
You may have to dimple out the area around the exit tube at the bottom and 
it is a tight fit pushing it into place. The pics from Thom are right on. 
The extra driving range is nice. BTW, what is a BN4? is that the reserve 
tank valve? My late model split didn't have that.

Good luck,
Chris
