Tedbear, you must not have been there recently, The
Michigan Fest is an entire weekened event now.  All
the big names and cars from the East Coast to
California are there inluding folks from Germany,
England on and on.  Oh yeah there IS camping too!
TONS of it.  

Just seems foolish to schedule an event in same local
as the Michigan show, a true landmark and staple of
the VW comunity for years.  I have heard about the
Cinci camp out past couple years....I would love to
come to it as I am sure the LEAK OIL bus folks and
many other campers too.  But the Michigan Vintage show
IS the best show this side of the Mississippi and that
is where everyone is.  

It would be nice if the cinci camp out could be
schedulded maybe week after or before perhaps in the
future.  I am one of the board members that put on the
Toledo show and we know the other show heads in the
areas, we all work together and try to scheudle to not
conflict with each others shows.  It works great and
folks do not have to choose.  We should not be a
competition all the shows should work together.
