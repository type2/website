Sometimes a pair of needle-nose pliers works.


Hi Volks,
We have found that while doing this works, it works better if one can hold  
the nut and use the switch to turn it loose.  There is a notch in the dash  
that is designed to lock the switch from turning, but you can wiggle the switch  
loosening the nut up and not putting so much torque that can cause the 
makeshift  tool you are using to strip the notches in the nut out.
