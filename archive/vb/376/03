Subject: Re: [VB] Removing wiper motor switch...

 I a long time a go bought a tool for undoing the escutcheaon from a listee... it fits the 68& later escutcheaons , but not the earlier ones which have the notches closer together.
 
I made a tool from a pieces of flat metal to fit the earlier escutcheans.   I used a grinder to cut it to the correct shape.  The ends are tapered.   This way the escutcheon doesn't get buggered up.
 
the 65 & earlier switches have the screw underneath.  The 66& later ones are held in by the aluminium escutcheon.

You really need the yoke tool that straddles the post to access the
two holes to unscrew the face. In lieu of this, a couple of small
screwdrivers or ice picks can be used.

   I was wondering if anyone had a successful method for removing the dash
mounted wiper motor switch.  The knob screws off but that still leaves me
with a post and only two very small holes on the side of the post to unscrew
it?  I don't want to damage that sucker too much.?  Most of the other ones
have a bottom screw anchoring them..
