Subject: Carb wierdness

Hi Volks,
Soliciting opinions on some annoying behavior.  A while back I started 
getting some major hesitation coming off idle at stoplights - touch the 
gas and almost stall the engine, but tickle it and get the revs up: no 
problem.  I thought I had traced it to a bad accel pump & decided to 
replace the carb.  The decision seemed vindicated when the temporary 
replacement carb eliminated the problem.

But it's back, and this is with a brand new carb.  Stock-size Brosol 
30/31, SVDA dizzy, compufire, CDI on a rebuilt 1600 SP with stock 
exhaust.  Here are the conditions:
- Starts easy, idles fine and has good power while the choke is on.
- Once the choke warms up, idles OK but then will randomly slow way 
down and stall out, die.
- Once the engine warms up a little more (5 minutes), it no longer 
stalls by itself, but the idle runs really high despite several 
adjustments, and it bogs seriously coming off idle unless you really 
jiggle the throttle.  Soon as the RPMs are up, it pulls fine and 
steady.

Vacuum leak around manifold at carb or heads?  Bad carb adjustment?  
Distributor advance?  Valve adj?  Butterfly in China?  Idjit owner?

I am notoriously stupid at troubleshooting fuel/ignition issues, but 
would like to learn from this.  I'm ready to take it to a mechanic -- 
if I can find a real VW mechanic in Tallahassee.  Y'all save me from 
myself.

TIA,
Joe Clark
