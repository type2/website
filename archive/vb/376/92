Subject: re:  lower nose repair

Hey, I have that problem too.  The lower nose on my 67
Westy is rusted out all the way across.  I've gathered
the necessary tools and looked at the stuff on Metal
Wizard.  Does anyone have photos of the job during the
steps it takes to complete the repair?  I'm wondering
how to bend the flanges, get the curve in the flange
all the way across and then bend the flange over the
adjoining piece to form the hem.  And what happenes on
the ends?  As this is my daily driver it's kind of
intimidating to cut it apart and face a long down time
if I goof it up.  Thanks ...

John
67 Westy
