 THIS TOOK TWO PAGES OF THE TUESDAY USA TODAY - IT IS FOR REAL

Pager : 765/420 - 6575

      To all of my friends, I do not usually forward messages, But this is
from my friend Pearlas Sandborn and she really is an attorney.

If she says that this will work - It will work. After all, What have you  got
to lose?

      SORRY EVERYBODY.. JUST HAD TO TAKE THE CHANCE!!! I'm an attorney,

      And I know the law. This thing is for real. Rest assured AOL and

   &nbs p;  Intel will fol low through with their promises for fear of facing
a multimillion-dollar class action suit similar to the one filed by PepsiCo
against General Electric not too long ago.

      Dear Friends; Please do not take this for a junk letter. Bill Gates
sharing his fortune. If you ignore this, You will repent later.

      Microsoft and AOL are now the largest Internet companies and in an
effort to make sure that Internet Explorer remains the most widely used
program, Microsoft and AOL are running an e-mail beta test.

      When you forward this e-mail to friends, Microsoft can and will track it
(If you are a Microsoft Windows user) For a two weeks time period.

For every person that you forward this e-mail to, Microsoft will pay you
$245.00 For every person that you sent it to that forwards it on, Microsoft
will pay you $243.00 and for every third person that receives it, You will be
paid $241.00. Within two weeks, Microsoft will contact you for your address
and then send you a check.

Regards. Charles S Bailey General Manager Field Operations

thought this was a scam myself, But two weeks after receiving this e-mail  and
forwarding it on. Microsoft contacted me for my address and withindays, &! gt;
receive a check for $24,800.00. You need to  respond before the beta testing
is over. If anyone can affoard this, Bill  gates is the man.

It's all marketing expense to him. Please forward this to as many people  as
possible. You are bound to get at least $10,000.00 We're not going to  help
them out with their e-mail beta test without getting a little  something for
our time. My brother's girlfriend got in on this a few  months ago. When i
went to visit him for the Baylor/UT game. She showed me  her check. It was for
the sum of $4,324.44 and was stamped "Paid in full"

Like i said before, I know the law, and this is for real.
