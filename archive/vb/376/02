Sometimes a pair of needle-nose pliers works.  Hold the pliers so the
ends of the jaws are apart a little bit and the switch shaft fits into
the opening of the jaws.  Make sure the ends of the jaws seat down
really well into the notches in the nut.  Then grab one handle in each
hand and press the jaws into the notches while turning.
