Subject: Re: Gas Guage, Horn?

Well I think I have finally figured out the cause of the gas gauge problem.

I bought a potentiometer as suggested and hooked it up as Matt described in his previous post and the gauge worked, except I could not get it to drop below a 1/4 tank and that's with hooking the ground wire to both outside lugs on the pot as described. So I took the sender out of the tank and hooked it up to the gauge with new jumper wires, stuck a coat hanger in one of the holes in the bottom and cycled the float with no action at the gauge. The gauge sat at 1/1 the entire time and I could hear and feel the float going up and down. So it looks like a new sender eh.

Also has anybody done the late Bay bus gas tank conversion? I've seen the "How To" on the VB site but I have some question about hooking up a BN4 with the late gas tank. Anybody have any good insight? I figured it would involve having another outlet brazed on to the tank in some fashion.
