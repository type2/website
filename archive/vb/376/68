Subject: Leaving for Lake Havasu Thursday morning from Bay Area

Jan & I plan to leave in the 87 vanagon westy, for BBTBX early on Thursday morning, getting there at around noon on Friday. See you all there.
We will probably be joined by  Alison driving the 70 westy. Our route will be down 99 to bakersfield , over the Tehachapi pass and on the LHC.
The weather forecast looks excellent, highs in the mod 60's lows in the mid fortys with no rain.
