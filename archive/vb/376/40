Subject: Drag Link 

I finally check out the slop in the steering today. Dtetermined to find 
the culprit, I got my 10 year old in the drivers seat and had her turn 
the steering wheel back and forth.  I soon as I got underneath my '60, I 
saw that the tierod on the drag link was moving all over the place.  Can 
I replace just the tierod end? If this is possible, are they left or 
right threads? Or do I need to replace the entire drag link  Thank in 
advance.
