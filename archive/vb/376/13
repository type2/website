Subject: Junk e-mail

Sorry folks on that junk. I accidentally sent it out to all my contacts. I am
cathing an earful from family, friends and of course you guys. But to make it
up to you, if Billy Gates sends me a check I will donate 100% of it to The
Arizona Bus Club for the raffle bus fund. I truly do apoligize!
