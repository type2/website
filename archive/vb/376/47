Subject: Re: [VB] Drag Link 

I use a small two jaw gear puller to knock out the tie-rod ends.  The 
puller I use also works on the drag link ends, it is a tight situation 
though near the steering gear box.  It takes some patience and most 
likely several attempts messing with the adjustable tie rod and the drag 
link to get the toe-in in spec and the steering wheel centered.  You 
will be very happy with the way your bus steers when you get this 
right!  Gary Gibson
