Subject: was bench test...

Thanx to all who helped and replied..

 

I had over complicated matters, and finally had a vision of what everyone
was trying to tell me..

Once I had the wires connected, I had bad connections, put of different
cables, and finally had the engine turning.

 

The compression test is as follows..

 

#1  110

#2  100

#3  45

#4  85

 

This is a 1500 SP "O" case
