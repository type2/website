Hi Karl,

How does that play with a rim that is not really straight? Will the tire 
"average" out the wobble? If I spin the wheel, the tire has a little wobble 
too. Can I use the inside of the brake plate? Or how about removing the 
wheels and measuring off the outside of the drums? In that case, what 
dimension should be used? Its gotta be something less than 1/8".
