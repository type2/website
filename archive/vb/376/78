Conrad,
	I don't know of anything in contemporary fuel that is able to 
destroy old carbs.   The metal parts at least.   In fact, I've found 
that my solex carbs stay cleaner on the new fuels.  I ran old school 96 
octane leaded fuel as recently as the mid-90's in New Zealand and found 
more gumming issues with that petrol.  It stayed "fresh" in the tank 
much longer, though.
	You need to check the advance on every new ignition distributors 
you install.  Check for full advance, 28-32* BTC, and settle on an idle 
setting based from that.  Good luck!  Gary Gibson
