Subject: Furthur bus rescue

Not a VW, but another iconic bus from the '60s.  Anyone know what
happened to the counterfeit Furthur bus Kesey tried to give to the
Smithsonian?

Pictures of pranksters pulling it out of the woods- great biomass patina!

It'll be interesting to see how they decide to do the restoration, as
I understand it the artwork was often painted over, so it was
constantly changing.
