Hi Volks,

I've never attended the Michigan show OR Buses'N'Boats, but I've  
heard very good reports on both events.  Since these events are more  
than 200 miles apart I really don't think there is a conflict here.

A successful campout is not about numbers. A friendly campfire, some  
teamwork making Breakfast Burritos and a couple buses is all it takes.


Happy trails,
