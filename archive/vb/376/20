Subject: Re: [VB] Installing 40hp Muffler and Heater Boxes

Yes, sorry, it is a 40hp engine as well. I am pretty sure that they
are 40hp heater boxes also, though I will say that it has been a lot
harder to find correct parts and such, since I have been starting from
scratch with nothing to go by. So I really appreciate the help.
