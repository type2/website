Subject: wiring question....

Hello All,
    Well, I got my rear wheels on, fixed the tailpipe to the muffler, took
the bus off the jack stands and went to start it up, and i have nothing at
the ignition switch. Neither of the oil pressure or generator lights are
coming on. Acts pretty dead. I checked to make sure I had put the negative
terminal back on, and I had. I tried the headlights,and they work. Tailights
work. turnsignals aren't working, and when I pull up on the turn signal
switch, the turnsinals were flashing! I was wondering how hard of a job is
it to just disconnect it all at the fuse panel. and clean,  rehook it all
back up? I have a Bently manual but there is no color coding in it? Can you
just use the terminal numbers? Kind of like Rex, I took a step
backwards....Not to far I hope though! It's so darn hot , i'll have to
tackle it first thing in the morning.
Peace, Jason
