There is a product I've used before that was a single part rust
inhibitor that I've never heard mentioned here before.  Its called Zero
Rust.  I've purchased it in oddball colors (like green) for about 5
bucks a quart at autobody stores near me.  Len from the
Autobodystore.com sells it 

http://www.autobodystore.com/new_page_1.htm but I've never purchaced
from him.  This is supposed to be a cheep alternative to POR if applied
correctly.  I've only brushed it but I believe thinned it can be
sprayed.  The only thing I noticed is that it took a long time to fully
cure (much like enamel ).
