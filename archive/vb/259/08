Subject: Re: [VB] Back up lights

Did the nosecone have a place for the switch on all '67 nose cones?  Or just
on the nose cones that were in a bus with reverse lights.  My '67 is an
early '67 without reverse lights, so I'm asking if it would have the switch
or not.  Where on the nose cone is it located?  Thanks.
