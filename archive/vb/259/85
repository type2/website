Matt, List,

The cooking grease makes sense to me.  While getting ready to remove the
alt.  I pulled off the pulley, and noticed that the half with the hole in it
(kinda oval-ish) was not oval-ish anymore.  It has formed a wobble pattern.
bigger on the ends and still narrow in the middle.  Time to order a new
pulley.  Does the alt. come out the same way in the bus as in a bug?  Did
not get far enough to find out last night.
