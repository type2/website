Subject: RE: [VB] undercoating ?

  There is a video available called Built by Hand. It follows a 356 Porsche
through the whole build process. In one scene they show the undercoating
being applied, yes MOST 356's came undercoated from the factory). They
BRUSHED it on all the seems and sprayed the rest of the car. Can't really
say how good it protected them as I replaced a lot of floors and other sheet
metal in them, but most of the rust originated on the inside working out.

Hi Kevin,
We would not!  You want to be able to inspect the undercoating and do any 
brush on repairs to it as needed.
