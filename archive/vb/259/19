Subject: RE: [VB] Help With Brakes Pulling Right

I can second that! When I first got my SC it was pulling to the right and the
brake pedal was really tight. The group lead me to the four rubber brake lines
which I replaced and WOW! brake pedal again. Of course I had to replace my
front brake shoes and wheel cylinders and that was a world of difference. I
also replaced the dual circuit MC with a late model one and an adapter plate.

Wayne,

Sounds like your flexible brake hoses are bad. They're the black rubber
hoses from the back of each brake plate up to the stationary metal brake
lines. When they get old, they constrict flow. I'm speaking from 1967
experience. Your older bus may vary...
