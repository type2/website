Subject: RE: [VB] Seat springs

Paul,

Spring steel is hard to weld and high heat will change the metals
consistency.  Also to weld anything you will need to separate it from all
flammables, i.e. fabric, horsehair etc.  Might consider looking for seat in
really bad shape and ask to buy a spring.  The way you can insert it without
having to destroy the fabric.  Got to be someone on the list that has one.

has anyone got
any other ideas?
