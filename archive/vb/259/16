Subject: [Vb] RE: frozen shock bushing

I may be in worse trouble then I let on because I started to hack saw the
bushing were it meets the trailing arm and I cut in to the stud about a mm
or two... _sigh_ I thought if a cut it there a bit a could put
a hammer and chisel to it, now I'm pretty screwed cause the stud is
no longer any good
