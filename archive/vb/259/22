"Torsion arm", usually.

You have to take the steering knuckle and shock absorber off and loosen up
the set screw in the end of the torsion arm - then it "should" just pull
out.  (I took the ones out of a Bug and they were pretty easy.)  If you
put the same piece back in you should just be able to put everything back
together, but if you put in a new torsion arm you I think you're supposed
to redo the link pin shims.

>Also, is is safe to cut the old stud off, drill and retap another?

The original stud is just pressed in to the torsion arm, not threaded.
The Bentley manual (p. V-6 3) says to drill and ream the hole oversize
and press in an oversize stud.  Sections V-5 and V-6 of the Bentley,
in general, apply to the front torsion arms and shocks.
