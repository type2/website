A 40 W pencil will probably take forever on the fuse box clips.  I'd
use at least a 100 W iron for that job.  When I soldered the big brass
terminals on a headlight switch, I had a 140 W iron and that wasn't
really enough.  Higher-powered soldering irons often let you do _less_
damage to the materials that surround the metal you're soldering,
because you can get "in and out" quicker.

Any place that you have two pieces of metal that conduct electricity
touching one another, solder them together.
