Subject: bus in Nashvegas

So after taking our daughter to the dr for a checkup in Nashville, we
went to McD's. Sitting across the street (at a hotel of all things)
near Vanderbild was a red/white 67 westy. It was loaded w/ all sorts
of accessories (tons of lights) as well as safari front/rear windows.
Had front/rear racks painted red/white/blue w/ several american flags.
It was apparently someone that was associated w/ Ft Campbell b/c it
had base stickers. Anyone know this bus, or the owner? Not many split
people here in my area.
