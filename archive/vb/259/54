Subject: Seat springs

I have just replaced the bottom seat pad of my drivers seat - wow what a
difference!  The padding is now at the same height as the bench seat and it is
a lot more comfortable.

Pulled the seat back cover off, however one of the springs is broken - it is
the top spring which is attached to the seat back and the DPO had bodged a
load of material and gaffer tape to prevent the spring coming through the
cover along with his very thin sheet of foam for a seat pad.  Would it be
possible for me to sleeve this and mig weld it either end?  Or has anyone got
any other ideas?

I doubt I will be able to get a used spring cheaply due to the popularity of
buses in the UK at the moment meaning the traders have bumped up the prices of
all parts to cash in on it...

Thanks
Paul
