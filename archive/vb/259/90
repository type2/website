Subject: [VB] help with double cab roof section shipping


Hi All,

 

A while ago, I asked for some help getting a double cab roof section
from Newark CA (bay area) down to Wilmington (LA/Huntington Beach).  A
list member emailed and said he could help.  Unfortunately, it all
didn't work out so once again, I'm trying to help a friend out in Europe
to receive a roof section that he paid for a loooooong time ago and get
it down to a container in SoCal, bound for BBTs in Belgium.

 

I know my friend paid $75 for shipping on it so at least that should be
available to anyone willing to lend a hand.

 

 

Pmail me for more info.  I have phone numbers and addresses of where it
is and where it needs to get to.

 

Thanks for any help.  

David
