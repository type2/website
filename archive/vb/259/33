Subject: 30PICT3

My bus turned 40 on Saturday. I celebrated with a 30PICT3
carb to match the 205M dizzy I put on a month ago. I'm happy
with the final results, although getting there was a bit
trying. The intermediate step of 205M and Brosol30/31 was
not a happy combo, the engine liked to backfire when I let
off the throttle. The Brosol30/31 dropped the engine speed
down to idle in a heartbeat, whereas the 30PICT3 drops it
over half a dozen seconds. No more backfiring. What controls
the rate at which a carb drops the engine speed? The 30PICT3
I used does not have the throttle positioner arm.
With the 009 and Brosol30/31 I had to be pretty heavy footed
to accelerate. The 205M and 30PICT3 combination accelerates
just fine without me having to open up the throttle so much.
I've been led to believe there is some improved fuel
efficiency in that, but I haven't been counting. I certainly
feel like I'm using less of the throttle when I drive.
The first attempt with the carb was foiled by a bad
electromagnetic cut-off valve. The engine would run nice
with throttle open, but wouldn't idle. Took me some stress
to figure that out, but it is a good thing to have learned.
So they fail closed, huh? On page 133 of Muir's book he
writes about a plug that replaces this. Anyone know anything
this? Anything that can be done if yours dies and you don't
have a spare? Otherwise that's another $20 spare part to buy
and carry...
Jetting:
I meant to jet this thing like my bay book says a 1970 bay
should be: 112.5 mains, 65 idle, 140 air correction. Does
this sound right? I tore apart three 30PICT3s and found two
jetted: 112.5 mains,65 idle,125 air; and one jetted: 122.5
mains, 65 idle, 130 air. I went with the two-thirds majority
and jetted accordingly. I couldn't get the mixture screw to
do its thing with the 65 idle so I went down to a 60 and now
it behaves. The 112.5 mains is scaring me, I used to run a
115, so I know that works. I drove maybe 50 miles on the
interstate today in typical 100F summer temps, oil temp went
to 215F where I feel it used to run closer to 210F. Maybe
I'm paranoid, but maybe I'm right. Oil pressure stayed
strong, So I'm thinking hard about a 115 mains. But without
a cylinder head temperature sensor it is a bit of a guessing
game. I think I best guess rich.
