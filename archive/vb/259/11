Subject: [VB] bottom front driverside shock bushing frozen to stud

I need some advice: 
I removed my front drivers 
side shock yesterday in hopes to replace it and I found that the bottom shock bushing was completely wedged on to the stud!! The shocks were
so dead it wasn't even funny so I can only assume that the pounding
of the bumps caused the stud to get bent by the bushing and as a result the bushing won't come off.  Its on there real good, no wd40 helping here no vice grips puling, hammer pounding, nothing..  I thought about taking the bushing out of the new 
shock and putting it on the old shock bushing but that's too 
much of a hack job even for me (besides, there is hadly any thread showing). 
    What is the part called that the botom of the shock mounts 
to - the trailing arm?  
    What kind of job is it to replace it and what bearings, seals, special tools do i need to replace it?  Also, is is safe to cut the old stud off, drill and retap another? I was bummed because I had just finished the front brakes and replaced the other shock when this reared its ugly head.  thanks in advance,
-rob
