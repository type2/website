Subject: RE: [VB] soldering fuse box

Kevin, Years ago I had a 65 bug with a 6V 40hp. I got tired of my dim lights
so I bought a switch and a 6 volt relay with 20 amp contacts. I then ran power
to the switch from wire 15 and then to the relay to ground. I ran a #10 wire
from the battery positive to the relay 20 amp contacts and then to the
headlights. My lights were MUCH brighter.

Back to 6V problems again...i have never solved this to any
satisfaction...my headlights are still extra dim. I cleaned every connection

Any suggestions appreciated...

Thanks
