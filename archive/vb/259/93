Subject: got it!

I got my wiring problem figured out....well not all of it, but the part that
kept me from being able to drive it. There was a red and grey wire that had
come off of terminal 30 on the light switch that goes over to terminal 30 on
the ignition switch. I crimped the connector so it would be a little tighter
and put it back on. Must have come off when I was puting in the speedo cable
and parcel tray. So, I checked the oil level again, checked my fan belt,
looked for any m,issed tools, and fired her up! He started right up. Oil
light went out, So I assume I got the oil pump installed corretly. Looked
for any big leaks. All looked ok, So i drove it around the block. Rides alot
nicer with the new tires! The steering effort is greatly reduced now i also
noticed. I still need to read up on doing an alighnment. Is it ok for me to
do the alighnment? Or is it better to take it somewhere and have it done? I
would guess that it would be pretty simple? Just need a tape measure? I
drove it over to a body shop and they can straighten out and re-weld my rear
upper shock mount for me for 60 bucks at the most. Have to wait till Monday
for that. So overall it was a great success! Too dang hot to do much else
with it today....Have to wait till this evening. I don't want to drive it
very much anyway, until I can get that shock mount fixed. Thanks for all the
helpful tips !
