yes, you can go to the Obsolete Aircooled Documentation project and look up 
tranny section for nose cone and see when they got the one with the plug.

Thing is, the buses are over 35 years old and the tranny may have been 
changed at some point during that time.   I forget when side the switch is on, bus 
if you crwal under and look at both side and don't see it it is probably not 
there.

 on the nose cones that were in a bus with reverse lights.  My '67 is an
 early '67 without reverse lights, so I'm asking if it would have the switch
 or not.  Where on the nose cone is it located?  Thanks.
