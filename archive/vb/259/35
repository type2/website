Hey Frank, did you say a curse word when it happened?!

You can try extracting it (the broken bleeder) by
various means, but I have found that it is less
frustrating and just as easy to install a new brake
wheel cylinder on that wheel, less tahn $10 at
BusDepot (sorry I couldn't help that shameless plug
;^)
