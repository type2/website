Subject: Bleeder valve repair

 If you broke the bleeder valve off because you applyed turning pressure at an
angle and snapped it off you might be able to carefully drill the center of
the valve until the drill stops, to the smallest eze-out size.  I once had to
do this on all four wheels because of a DPO using a vise grip and hitting the
backing plate while turning.
 If the valve is rusted in this method might not work.
