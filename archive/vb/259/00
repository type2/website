Subject: Re: [VB] Back up lights

That's what I do.  I forget sometimes, but someone here suggested a red
warning light to remind you.  Haven't got to it yet though.

Additionally having the light work with a switch lets me flash crazy
L.A. drivers closing in on my bumper at 80+mph in the slow lane.  Works
every time!
