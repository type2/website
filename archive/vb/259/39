Subject: RE: [VB] Help With Brakes Pulling Right

Just wanted to reply and tell everyone that wrote me thank you.  I order the
brake hoses from Ronnie, installed them, bleed the brakes and am back on the
road safety. Just a few more odds and ends and I will be at the Shoreline
Meet next Sat.  Again thanks for the pointers.

-Wayne
