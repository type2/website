How do you cover a VW T2 muffler with just 4 oz? That isn't much paint.

Have you actually successfully sprayed one with just 4 oz?

#1) Is this a one time deal? reply :It's a standard inventory product.
You can order anytime you wish.
#2) Do new systems need the sandblasting? reply: Yes new systems need to
be sand blasted to remove paint, oil, sealers on the pipes, muffler. The
ALK1104 needs the surface texture for proper bonding. After blasting the
system needs to be wiped down with lacquer thinner to remove any residual
dust, oil, hand prints.
#3) Does this process require baking? reply: The ALK1104 is water based,
and will cure on your vehicle as you drive. It requires about 30 minutes
at full operating temperature.
#4) Can the system be touched up if it gets rock pits etc.? reply; Yes
but the individual part needs to be sand blasted again for proper
bonding, the old material can remain. Spot repairs can be made.
#5) How is ALK1104 different from other coating processes?
