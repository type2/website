Subject: soldering fuse box

Back to 6V problems again...i have never solved this to any
satisfaction...my headlights are still extra dim. I cleaned every connection
I could find throughout the entire bus. I changed the connector at the
headlight-to a newer style. I went through matt's suggestions to find where
the resistance is...still no luck. The only thing I can think that is
left-is to install a relay for the headlight switches, switch to 12V, and
soldering the fuse box.

I know that this soldering of the fuse box has been discussed before, but
now I am actually finally doing it-but my soldering iron just seemed to crap
out on me, so I am planning on getting another tomorrow...is a basic 40W
pencil iron ok(that is what I have, never seemed to get hot enough) or there
is the dual heat soldering gun from rat shack-$29.99. this is 150W or
230W...I imagine this would make soldering much easier, come to think of it,
my friend might have this one-so I wouldn't have to buy a new one.

No in the fuse box I am putting together...there are the connections that
are kind of riveted together...I am trying to solder this connection. Then
there is the area of contact where the two metal pieces "squeeze" into the
black fuse box thingy...should I solder here as well after reconnecting
everything...i have been hesitant to do it this way, incase there area ever
any problems with it...it would be rather difficult to take apart to
reassemble.

Any suggestions appreciated...

Thanks
