Subject: Re: wiring help

Its doable but take notes, download thoms diagrams and think before you do 
it. A few good digital camera pics might help too. I did all of the above 
and still had a few little issues (mostly due to
trying to fix things rigged before I got the bus). I had to change my 
fusebox out later, best way, just do one at a time. Maybe If you have a 
spare one you could change the wires to it, clean and solder your better 
one, then swap it back in. if you get stuck, the diagrams are the best bet. 
Id also find a little file or something to clean the inside of the pushon 
terminals with (i used a roughed up spade
terminal and just kept going until it looked good to me. Tighten any loose 
ones with pliers a
bit too, i had a few things fixed just by that. Now i just need to fix horn 
and gas guage and
I have most the ammeneties of a 35 year old car!

It's doable, but can get confusing. Best to label all the wires as you pull
them off AND make a diagram of your own with remarks about the colors and
thicknesses of the wires that came off each terminal. The combination of
both labeling the wires and drawing the diagram will keep it pretty clear
when it goes back together.
