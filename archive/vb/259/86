Subject: Saving radio settings

Hi Volks- Can anyone suggest a way to keep my radio settings when I
disconnect the battery?  I disconnect my battery every time I work on my bus
and I generally forget to reset the radio until I am on my way out of
town..... Ted (financial report coming- fund drive was a great success)
