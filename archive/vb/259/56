Subject: Selling 66 21 Window

I hate to do it, but here goes.  I will be selling my restored 66 21 window
this weekend at the Shoreline show in Seattle.  I'm giving fellow vintage
lovers first shot.  If anyone is interested and wants to know more or see
pictures, email me or come by the show this weekend.  I'm listing it for 18K.
When you see, you'll know why.
