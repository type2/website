Thanks to mulletman for the above photo. These photos are encouraging me to
grow my hair but not cut the sides. My comment about the above noted photo is
not the hair. It's more related to the shirt. Um, did the shirt get snagged on
the EZ-UP post or did someone, at one point in time, use the "juice" without
hitting the gym enough? Mullet-man's-ierre candidate? Oh I forgot- it's the VW
crowd. Nevermind.

Hair getting longer but no man-boobs for me please!
