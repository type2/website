          Was the Westy racks also painted?  It sounds like Rick Smiths Bus.
He's a Army Special Ops Medic that was stationed on Fort Bragg up until Sept
2000.  He had orders the Fort Campbell before 911.  I tried to track that
Bus down for a year to find the owner.  The came to work one day at it was
parked in the parking lot at work,  Although I was Air Force we were a joint
unit that trained Special Ops Medics.  Any was, if you get a chance to meet
him and look in it.  You'll be amazed at all the accessories he has in it.
He may not remember me, but if you meet him give him my email or get his for
me.  I have heard from him since early winter of 2000.  He has a Ghia that's
pretty nice also and his wife had a nice Bus convertible.
