Subject: RE: [VB] Bleeder Valve sheared off

  It's easier and cheaper in the long run to just replace the rear wheel
cylinder ($ 12.50 or so). If the bleeder was frozen, more then likely the
wheel cylinder is shot or close to it.  The hardest part will be removing
the drum if you do not have the proper equipment.

Hello All,
I sheared off the bleeder valve from a rear hub on a 71.  What is involved
in
replacing this.
Kind Regards,
