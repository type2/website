Hi,

I would not count on any carb you get as being perfect. I got several  
Bocars that run like junk one way or another, and got one from  
Richard that looked like the bottom of a swamp inside. He promptly  
replaced it with me paying shipping, which I inspected before using  
obviously.

I got one of those nifty 13mm carb wrenches from John  
(aircooled.net), which I recommend because you'll be taking that carb  
on and off several times before getting it right.

Conrad
