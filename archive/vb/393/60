You could try Verne's Chrome Plating in Gardena. 1559 El Segundo Blvd. 
323-754-4126
I am in no way endorsing them. Just know they have been in business for a 
long time and they do bumpers and auto parts and other parts of all kinds. I 
have never used their services.

There may be other listees that have experience with them.
