Hey Folks,
All this chatter on the od brake drum got me curious so I e-mailed
the seller in the Phillipines. This is what she returned with:

Hello and thank you for your email.

Re: T2 Brake Drum # 200-609-215 / 200-609-617
Application for :
Early VW Bus, Kombi, Panel and Pick-up with:
Chassis number:
1952- 20-035112

Should  have other concern please free free to email us back again, thank
you so much.

As I said those numbers don't cross in my VW parts book for early bus
so perhaps they are some kind of "repop"? Moreover being listed in the 
Baywindow
want ad section of the samba seems to indicate some kind of 
mis-understanding on the sellers part.
I would think they don't belong there. Overall I would think the wise mans 
money
would stay in his pocket.

 That same vendor has been selling through quite a bit of NOS stuff.
 Maybe its only supposed to be a hub on a service trailer? I don't
 think it has a brake ring.

 Why don't you ask to see a pick from the other side?

 I searched the seller's other items and found a picture of the back in
 an ad for type 3 parts.  I thought maybe it was some sort of disc
 brake adapter, but it does actually have a drum.
