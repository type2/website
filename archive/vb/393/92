Subject: Re: [VB] Odd brake drum on TheSamba

 There is an ad for pentangular brake drums on TheSamba, seller gives a
 p/n 200-609-617.

 What would it have been used for?  If it fits a standard wide-five
 rim, the drum itself must be tiny.

They advertise that drum about every 2 weeks. I asked that same question on the Samba about a year ago......
never did get an answer.
