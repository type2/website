Subject: 1960 Double Cab - Lights, No Start

Last night I was driving home from the Tracy, CA V'Dub Club meeting in
my double cab when she died at a stop light and I couldn't start her.
Doesn't turn over at all, no clicking, no noise whatsoever.  Lights work
fine.  No starting trouble previous to this.  Do you think it might be
the starter or solenoid?  Can't troubleshoot til Saturday.  Any advice
appreciated!  Thanks.
