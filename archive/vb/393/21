Betcha the 113-101-375A head has a dowel pin offset between the two instake
ports.  It's used for help in locating the manifold end to the end when
tightening.  Not actually necessary, but nice to have.  The 311-101-375A
heads usually did not have this.  Otherwise, same valve sizes.  The 311 head
may (or may not) also have a "boss" threaded or blank for where the fuel
injection Temp II sensor goes on the Type 3 Fuel Injection models.
