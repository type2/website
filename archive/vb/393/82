Subject: westy curtain rods

So ... I have two of the westy curtain rods that sort of have the S shape in 
them. And one that doesn't have the S shape. How many more of the S shapes 
do I need ... my bus is a 60 standard. So ... would there be 3 on the 
driver's side and 3 on the passenger side? Has anyone ever bent later 
curtain rods to match the shape of the S rods?

Anyone have any S shaped curtain rods they want to sell or trade?

TIA
