I've seen this part number usage before.  The aftermarket manufacturers use
these numbers because they can make it fit more than one year split.  The
difference between a mid 64-67 and a 68-70 bus rear drum is the way they
meet up with the backing plate.  You could take one, and with a little
machining, make it the other part.

The other type he has looks like the front hubs for the bus sand rail that I
never built!!
