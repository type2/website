Subject: RE: [T2] Only idles with choke fully closed

John,

I would first replace the choke element.

I just went through the exact same thing. I took the carb back and all was
cured since it came from the factory with a huge vacuum leak and bad choke. 

However, there is something funky with the choke on this one as well. I am
just going to replace it and in the meantime, I have to wire the choke
butterfly open if I want to restart it after it is warmed up.

These replacement 34Pict3 carbs are crap. If you replace it, get one from
these dudes. http://www.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=64882

Hey Y'all,
I just got a bus with a 1600 DP - 34pict3 carb- 009
dizzy (I know, I know, no advice about the 009
needed!!).  It seems to run pretty well, but it will
only idle when the choke is fully closed, as soon as
it opens, the engine dies.  I adjusted the choke
element so that the choke stays on (closed
butterfy)and unhooked the wire and it idles great and
runs great, but obviously will be running rich this
way.  So what is the likely culprit that would cause
the engine to idle only with the choke fully closed?? 
I have set timing, adjusted idle screw and gas screw.
So where should I go next??

Peace, John Baker
