Subject: Vintage K.D. tool...

Hi all,

I recently scored a box full of old VW special tools, and among them is a tool
by K D tools that I'm not familiar with.  Stamped in its' side is "K D 52" .
Does anyone have access to an old K D Tool catalog, or have this tool and know
its applications on a VW?  The company says it is a "KD Bingo wheel puller"
for jarring wheel hubs loose without damaging the axle.I understand that it
would protect the threads and threaded end of the axle shaft, but I wonder how
banging on the end of an axle or stub axle might affect bearings, etc.  Does
this sound right?

It screws onto the fine threaded axle shaft of a Bug axle or early bus axle
stuband has a flat end that you could pound on (think of a huge cap nut that
you could pound on the top surface of the cap for some purpose?

Anyway, just curious if anyone knew this tools' purpose...
