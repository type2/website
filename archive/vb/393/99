Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Odd brake drum on TheSamba

 that just seems odd to me.
 
I really doubt the pentangular drum is for a split bus, but it would look good on the wall. :)
I somehow think overseas shipping for brake drums is not cheap enough for me to want one.
 
I have the feeling that the info in the email is maybe off.
