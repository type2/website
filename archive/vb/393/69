'1960 Double Cab - Lights, No Start'

Same thing happened to a fellow air cooler at our last gathering a few weeks
ago. I crawled up under his Beetle and the power wire on the solenoid had
come loose. Plugged it back on the spade terminal and off he went. Hopefully
it's something simple like that on your DC.
Enjoy the journey,
Gary
