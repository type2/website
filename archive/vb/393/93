Subject: Re: [VB] Odd brake drum on TheSamba

I'm far from an expert on type 2 brakes, particuarly '68 baywindow and 
later.
I do however own a '63 15 window deluxe and have a reprint of the parts 
manual covering
1950 thru 1967 split window buses. Those part numbers shown in the photo's
aren't listed for front or rear axle drums on early buses. I notice also 
most type 2 stuff
starts with the prefix 211 as opposed to 200. My guess is, if they are 
indeed
genuine VW, most likely they are for some other application.

[VB] Odd brake drum on TheSamba


 Tristan said:


 There is an ad for pentangular brake drums on TheSamba, seller gives a
 p/n 200-609-617.

 What would it have been used for?  If it fits a standard wide-five
 rim, the drum itself must be tiny.

 They advertise that drum about every 2 weeks. I asked that same question on 
the Samba about a year ago......
 never did get an answer.
