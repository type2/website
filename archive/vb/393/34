Subject: Alternator with 34 pict 3

Got my new bus home this past weekend.  It has a 1600
DP with an alternator installed.  The accelerator pump
does not clear the alternator body.  I thought there
was an adaptor you could buy that raised the carb a
little higher to nake the clearance, but I couldn't
find it online anywhere.  So I browsed the T2 archives
and found that some have grinded the body of the
alernator to get the clearance.  Can I really do
this???? OR better yet, can someone point in the right
direction to find the carb spacer??
