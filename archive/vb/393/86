Hi all

I made one of these neat circuits

http://www.epemag.com/0207p2.html

and installed it in another of my classics with cool results - thought 
you guys might be interested.

Now I'm gonna put one in the Westy and impress passersby with my fade 
out interior light

(It's winter and the nights are long)
