Subject: crankcase filling with gas

I made a test by removing the carb, and (gasp) letting raw gas run down into 
the intake manifold - a continuous stream for around 30 seconds.  It takes a 
while but the gas DOES work its way past the valves and rings and does 
eventually come dripping out of the oil drain plug.  So the carb flooding due to bad 
or incorrect metering valve or stuck float will fill your crankcase with GAS.   
In all my years i have never seen this but now I have.   Anybody know if 
there are different length metering valves for these PICT 31/34 ???  carbs.  I 
think it is Brazilian.  I put one of the standard metering valves from a 11 
dollar kit in there and maybee it needs double washers but I think there may be a 
different one for this carb.  The original I took out was kinda stepped looking 
and different.
