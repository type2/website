Hi Dave,
113 101 375A is more likely the part number.  As for good, bad, or Ok,  it 
depends on how you are going to use it!  For us with daily driving, we  would 
only use DP heads that are the thicker type to prevent head cracking, and  only 
if going to fuel injection.  These improved DP heads have to use a  spark plug 
with much longer than the 1/2" previous type.
  Want to try FI sometime, but for now will stick to single port  because 
this type of head had better lower RPM torque, and no extra pair of  seals in the 
single carb intake manifold.
