Tony,

It can also fill the cylinder and hydrolock (or would that be
petrolock?) the engine.  You might want to make sure the fuel tank is
venting properly by removing the gas cap briefly and see if the flow
rate changes.  Fuel vapors in the tank can force gas through the flap
valves in the pump and the float valve in the carb even when the fuel
level in the tank is below the float bowl.
