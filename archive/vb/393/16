Subject: Wesry interior restore - where to get vinyl, paneling and

Hi
 
We are getting ready to restore the interiors on a 67 Westy and a 71 Westy, 
 
Is there any place to get the yellow/gold colored vinyl to recover the seats ?
 
what about the baltic birch paneling in a size long enough to do the long panel on the drivers side ?
 
and the laminate that is on the cabinets ,  most of that is good but it would be nice to have a source 
 
lastly the correct color yellow/gold fabric for the poptop
 
Thanks for all your help
 
Dave
