Subject: crankcase filling with gas

Its back again - I replaced the fuel pump and gas is still somehow filling up 
my crankcase.  Does anybody know exactly what years are supposed to use a 
4.25" fuel pump rod and which use a 4"????  I cant believe I got two faulty fuel 
pumps in a row.  And as far as the carb, I rebuilt it again and I cant believe 
that the gas is running down the carb, past the valves, past the rings and 
into the crankcase in such a hurry as the dripping starts when i hook up the 
fuel to the fuel pump.  I THINK MY BUS MAY BE EVIL

Tucson in pain
