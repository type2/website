Subject: Re: [VB] SO-23 cabinet

It is just storage!  It has a laminate bottom so no liquids!   If the bus
was not covered in snow and ice on the car cover I would run out and take a
pic but it is covered!  Remind me this spring and I will take a pic!

Here is a picture I took looking down in to the box when I had the bus down 
at the shop!!
