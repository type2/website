Subject: Re: starting issue

Do you have a voltmeter to check the charge in the battery?   If it is 12V the 
battery should be at 12.5V or more.   I have had dimly glowing gen light at idle 
in 6V VWs, but that seems to indicate a charging issue in the 6V ones.  

Are the generator brushes good?  they are the rectangular blocks of graphite in 
the gen... one in the upper slot, one in the lower.   the brushe should stick 
out past the metal 'box' it slides into.  Also check that the wire to the screw 
is intact and the screw isn't loose, on both brushes.  
 You may need a mirror 
and flashlight to check the lower brush.

When I got around to checking the problems with my bug, I also disconnected and 
cleaned the battery ground, neg post, pos post, the things that go on the posts, 
and the connections from there to the voltage regulator and the generator.  (one 
at a time, so I didn't mix up wires).  I used dielectric grease at the connections, which is supposed to 
help against corrosion.   I have a battry terminal brush, which has one end that 
goes over the post and you spin it and the metal brush in it cleans the post all 
shiny.   You take it apart and there is a brush that fits in the piece that 
goes on the post to spin and clean that all shiny.   I used fine sandpaper or a 
wire brush on the push on connections elsewhere.   
I also had a couple fuse issues, that a couple new fuses (installed with dielectric grease) fixed.   Nice to have the lights work!  
 
I take off the the ground post connector at the battery first and  re-connect it last, so there aren't any hot leads while I clean 
them.   

If there is that white powdery ick at the battery, it is a sign that connections 
are bad.  It is corrosive and you should neutralise it with baking soda and 
rinse it out thouroughly with a hose.   That stuff make battery trays rust out!

I don't think the cleaning of connections I did on my bug solved the issue, 
which was seemed to be a connection at the generator, but those connections are 
a common place for problems, and definately couldn't have hurt anything. 


A whirring solenoid but no starter going implies to me a bad starter, though.

I tried Muir's method from the idiot book checking the starter and solenoid.  
Solenoid whirrs but can't get starter to turn over; plenty of spark down there 
though!  

I did have a dimly glowing gen light, and also dash lights/headlights dim 
sometimes.  My husband's mechanic, who did a tune up for my Christmas present as 
our time was limited, fixed some shorts but the gen light will still very dimly 
glow or sometimes when I accelerate while idling it will suddenly flash on.  

Wire at the coil is connected; that happened to me before so I did check that 
first.  
Thanks for all the suggestions - still working through as time allows.

If you cross the starter under the bus (in neutral with ebrake on please) does 
it start?   That would indicate the starter may be okay.
Did your gen light glow at all?
I recently had starting issues with my 69 bug and it turned out that there was a 
loose wire at the generator.  I think it caused charging problems. 

Is the wire at the coil still connected?   Often a connection just gets loose or 
needs cleaning.  Do the dash lights dim when you try to start it?
Hope it is something simple.

Club meeting in
my double cab when she died at a stop light and I couldn't start her.
Doesn't turn over at all, no clicking, no noise whatsoever.  Lights work
fine.  No starting trouble previous to this.  Do you think it might be
the starter or solenoid?  Can't troubleshoot til Saturday.  Any advice
appreciated!  Thanks.
