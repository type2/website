Hi ACapps99,

The longer fuel pump rod was used with the non-alternator type of shorty  
fuel pump.  If you have a non-Single Cab type 2, the upper half of the gas  tank 
is higher then the carb float bowl.  So it is easy to flood the carb  with 
fuel and down into the pistons and rings.....  Try taking off the carb  from the 
manifold, but keep it attached to the fuel line.  If you can get  it arranged 
into a pan you can see if it leaks into it.
  Otherwise it could be you used too long of pump rod and that tore up  the 
diaphram.
