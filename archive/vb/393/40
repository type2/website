Subject: Carburetor Rebuild Question

Hello, Bussers--

I'm rebuilding a 30 PICT 1 carb that was installed on a bus several 
years ago. The pin that restains the choke mechanism has been 
replaced by a small nail (bent and loose, at that!) I have another 28 
PICT carb that has a good pin--is it wise to try to pull it from that 
one and install it on the 30 PICT 1 carb? Or, should I rebuild the 
older carb (which is correct for the year of the bus anyway), and not 
tamper with it?

Tom
