Its back  again - I replaced the fuel pump and gas is still somehow filling

my  crankcase.  Does anybody know exactly what years are supposed to use a  
4.25" fuel pump rod and which use a 4"????  I cant believe I got two  faulty 
fuel 
pumps in a row.  And as far as the carb, I rebuilt it  again and I cant 
believe 
that the gas is running down the carb, past the  valves, past the rings and 
into the crankcase in such a hurry as the  dripping starts when i hook up the 
fuel to the fuel pump.  I THINK MY  BUS MAY BE EVIL




By your desription it has to be the pump. If you don't start the bus and  
just attach the fuel line and "the dripping starts" the pump has to be bad. The  
carb doesn't get fuel until the pump starts pumping. Measure your rod if it's  
the long one get a short one. OR cut yours down to the short length.
