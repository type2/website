Wilson [1] doesn't list such a part number; usually you see 111 or 113
as the first three numbers, not 110.  He does list a 113 101 375 A as
a dual-port 1600 head used on '71-'73 Bugs.

     ISBN 0-89586-225-5 .  Chapter 3 is IMHO pretty good at telling you
     what you probably have when you're staring at a pile of random
     engine parts.
