I've never seen a picture of this cabinet with the top open -- if it 
does indeed open. Not in the type2 library, not on Thom's site, and not 
on the Samba.

Sometimes it's photographed with the spun beakers, sometimes without. 
What is obvious in all the pictures is that the top is in two pieces. 
Each piece appears to be edgebanded in metal all the way around. That 
leads me to suspect that the forward part is hinged, or perhaps it just 
lifts off?

It looks just big enough to have a little insulation inside, for some 
ice and a couple of 7-1/2 oz. Coke bottles.

But I don't know what it is.
