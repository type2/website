Subject: Oktoberbus is coming!

It seems like it's a long time yet, but NOW is the time to start making 
plans to come to Oktoberbus!  In only 10 months the world renowned best 
unknown campout ever will be happening right here in scenic North 
Carolina.  It will be the FIRST weekend on October and not the second, 
due to scheduling conflicts at the castle.  That's OK though because the 
first weekend usually has better weather.
