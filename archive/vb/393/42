Subject: Only idles with choke fully closed

Hey Y'all,
I just got a bus with a 1600 DP - 34pict3 carb- 009
dizzy (I know, I know, no advice about the 009
needed!!).  It seems to run pretty well, but it will
only idle when the choke is fully closed, as soon as
it opens, the engine dies.  I adjusted the choke
element so that the choke stays on (closed
butterfy)and unhooked the wire and it idles great and
runs great, but obviously will be running rich this
way.  So what is the likely culprit that would cause
the engine to idle only with the choke fully closed?? 
I have set timing, adjusted idle screw and gas screw.
So where should I go next??

Peace, John Baker
