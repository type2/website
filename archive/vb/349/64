By the way...I would not be welding funky aftermarket tailpipes onto 'good'
stock collectors...the only reasons I would consider it with this one is
that A) Mine is on its last legs  B) I need as much power as possible on the
upcoming Shasta Trip, as I am carrying two passengers and loads of gear!

BTW, what does it mean when my engine is more clattery than I am used to.
Seems like the valves are loose, but the clearances check out fine.  One
point of interest:  Some of the valve stem ends do seem to be lower than the
round retainer clip, thus making checking the clearances difficult without
bending the tip of the gauge.
