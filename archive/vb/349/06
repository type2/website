ah ha!

I bet the last person who put that nut on (me) didn't remember to put
the lock washer on under that nut when he was putting the transmission
back in.

Suffice to say that when I pulled the nut off my spare starter, I also
pulled off the lock washer and installed them both.

Thanks for the hint Mark!

Cheers,
