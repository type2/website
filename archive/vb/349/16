Sounds rich to me - based mainly on the smell and the mileage - but I
am not an expert (I screwed up the last time I tried to make a
determination based on smog test readings.)  What do the plugs and/or
tail pipe look like?

The Bosch Automotive Handbook has a little graph of what HC, CO, and
NOx do according to mixture.  The Y axis is dimensionless graph, but
I will try to put some numbers (relative to 1.0) on it.  At rich
mixtures (lambda = 0.95), HC and CO start out at about 0.6.  As you
get leaner, both drop in about the same shaped curve, with CO always
running a little less than HC.  At stoichometric (sp?), lambda = 1.0,
HC is about 0.3 and CO is about 0.08.  At sort of lean (lambda = 1.025),
HC is about 0.3 and CO is almost zero.  At way lean (lambda = 1.05),
HC is about 0.08 and CO is zero.  Basically, CO and HC both go up as
you get richer.

NOx starts out low, peaks, and then falls off again.  At lambda = 0.975,
it is about 0.35.  At 1.0 it's about 0.6, and at 1.025 it peaks at
about 0.7.  By 1.05 it has fallen again to about 0.6.

Maybe you need a bigger carb?  You might be working too close to the
limits of adjustment of what you have.  Remember, VW went to the 34
PICT's for the 1600 engines.  According to Solex, it also depends on
how hard you run the engine.  Read pages 8 and 9 of the Solex manual at
http://failsure.net/oacdp/ .  It gives a formula for figuring out what
size carb you need, and when I run it for your 1679 with a max RPM of
4k, I get 33.6 mm.  At 5k you need 37.6 mm, and at 3.5k you need 31.4 mm.
If you don't run it over 3.5k then the 31 PICT is probably OK.

Starting on page 20, it tells you how to figure out the jets.  It starts
with the choke tube, which in most VW carbs is fixed, but this size is
also used to figure out the main jet size.  Assuming you stay with the
31 PICT, it suggests a choke tube of about 24.8 mm, and a main jet of
about 124 and air correction of 184.  They wimp out on the emulsion
tube.  On page 26, it suggests a pump jet size of about 41.3, but I
don't think that is changeable on VW carbs.  Page 31 has more tuning
suggestions and page 37 has suggestions about "too rich".

You might also look at page 45 of the '69 Without Guesswork at the
doc project to see what stock Bus gets for a 1500 (1493 cc) were. I'm
not too sure how to adjust these for your 1679 - the simple minded way
would be to multiply by 1679/1493 or about 1.125.  I would also guess
that your cam might mean that you can use a little more fuel than
stock.  Or, look at page 22 of the '73 Without Guesswork and either
extrapolate from the 1600s (with 34 PICT 3) or look at the data for
the dual-carb 1700s (2x 34 PDSIT).

Yow!  Did he actually let the clutch out that way, or did he realize
what happened before then?

So it sounds like Arizona tests on a dyno?  I hear California started
to do that, then backed off.  If there's more than one testing station
in town, it might pay to ask around the hot-rod community and figure
out which station has the stick-shift and hot-rod-friendly employees.
Either that, or get a Bus that falls before the year range for testing...
