You can check out the Autobody store online
for stripping .  they say it should only take 5-6 hours to strip a whole 
car.

You can strip the parts and coat with picklex and leave unpainted  as long 
as it is kept dry. Highly recommended by the pros.
  Check out the forum on the site too, lots of professionals on there to 
help you out with questions.

Good luck
