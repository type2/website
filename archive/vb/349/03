Any one know where I could source a new Shift Rod Coupling?   (The rear one
that connects the shift rod to the tranny.)   Mine is shot on my 65 Double Cab
work truck and I cannot find one listed for split window busses anywhere.  Any
help would be appreciated as mine is currently held together with hose clamps
and wire.
