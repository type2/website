The cover was designed by Just Kampers in England to fit all busses. This
one is well designed; I have never had a single complaint about the fit.
However, none of the covers I sell have a hole pre-cut for the antenna. The
reason is that antennas (antennae?) on busses were dealer-installed, not
factory-installed, so the exact location could vary.  So you would have to
cut a hole yourself.
