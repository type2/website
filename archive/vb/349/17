If I remember correctly, the threaded sleeve adapter from a spark plug 
will fit over the small starter post. Use it as a lock nut. They also 
fit the tail light screws if you need to affix a ground wire and make 
the tail lights a bit harder to steal.

Who's going to OCTO in two weeks, 2/6? It's also the same day as a 
highly regarded sports event that sells a lot of products to weak willed 
consumers.
