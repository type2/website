Subject: 8 days to go until the TCWBC

Hi Volks,

As it says in the headline, there are now only 8 days to go until the
True Canadian Winter Bus Campout near Cambridge Ontario. This is the
second year of the event, and we now have 10 buses confirmed to attend
the event, with visits promised from several others who choose to live
bus-less in winter. Even if you aren't driving a bus at the moment, if
you're feeling the need to get together with fellow bus pilots you're
more than welcome to stop in and have a visit. Just be sure to let me
know in advance if you're planning on staying for dinner.

What's to do at a winter campout?   PLENTY!!!

We'll have a winter hike/snowshoe/XC Ski expedition to explore the park
on Saturday afternoon, followed by an opportunity to learn ice
sculpture. For those interested in Ice Fishing there's a well-stocked
lake right at the park. If you catch it there, we'll cook it for
breakfast, to go with the Burritos. Or as a late-night campfire snack,
if you prefer.

Dinner time will bring us Canada's best "Chili in a Bread Bowl",
prepared by the "Duke Of Westfalia" himself, Dennis Jolliffe.  After
dinner there are plans for a Camp Coffee Cook-off, with a workshop on
how to produce the best cup of coffee possible when camping.

And then we will begin the Longest Campfire Of The Year, giving us an
excellent opportunity to take advantage of the fact that it gets dark
very early in February. We're planning on taking full advantage of this
with Everybus's "ncbus" Chris coming up from Greensboro to jam at the
coolest campfire jam session of the season.

The www.accuweather.com "Long Range" weather forecast calls for winter
weather, so be sure to pack your woolies and bring lots of warm
clothes. We'll have electric sites and there are flush toilets, heated
showers and laundry facilities nearby so everyone can stay warm and
comfortable.
