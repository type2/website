Subject: Clutch cable

I replaced my clutch recently, 

and now the clutch wasn't taking at the right place,

it seemed to "fall" off the Clutch pedal( it used to take low down on the
pedal, 

and now it was at the very top, the engine was revving whilst in gear) , 

So I made the cable shorter to try and fix this problem, but now

The clutch pedal comes up, and I have to assisted with my foot to help is to
the top, 

I Think It might be springs or something, Please Help
