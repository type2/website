Subject: [VB] clunking from rear wheel/reduction box

I replaced my outer rear axle seal a couple months ago and since have had an intermittant clunking that appears to be coming from the reduction box on that wheel ( driver's side).  It makes the noise with the engine off; engine on coasting in neutral or coasting in gear with the clutch in; it also makes it when driving normally.  It comes and goes and seems to increase with higher temps but that is somewhat anectdotal.  
    It sounds sort of like a bad bearing or a dull thumping/whirring and seems to make the noise every wheel revoloution or every other whell revolution.
   I have taken the whell and drum off to try to see if I can find anything wrong.  I did refill the reduct box after replacing the seal but did not top off the tranny.  I hope that redux box isn't toast. 
thanks
