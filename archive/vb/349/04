Subject: post mortem: intermittent alternator light

So a few weeks ago I was having problems with my alt/gen light coming
on intermittently in my 1967 freedom camper.

When I started having problems with the bus starting, I checked my
bentley and said: oh, well, it's probably a wonky connection in the
ignition switch.

I ran a hot wire from the battery to the coil (that I would attach
after starting the bus) which solved my intermittent power loss
problems for the time being, and ordered a new ignition switch.

The ignition switch arrived, but time has been short, so I continued
with the "push start & hot-wire" method for a week or so until i had
time to deal with it.

Imagine my surprise when I got under the bus to look at the starter and
found out I was missing the nut holding the 12V connection to the
solenoid.  The wire was still on the terminal, but not held down (and
therefore not making much of a connection).

I replaced the nut and have no more starting problems, no more
alternator light problems, no more (electrical) problems in general.

Ignition switch appears to be fine.

Happy happy!
