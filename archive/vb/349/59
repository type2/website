	I was looking for a quicker stop. I have already put a later bay
master cylinder in it to save my legs. I have lost all my brakes and luckily
there was no one in front of me. With that said I am looking to install a
set of Porsche wheels on the bus and install a straight axle kit in the
rear. I drive this to work each day on the highway and I need a little more
speed and a little more braking.  


Thanks again,

What vendors out there sell
kits that are resonable and can I just used a later 68/69 bay front end?
Hi Eric,
Try Wolfgang International for the kit.  You can use a 1968/69 front beam
and use 1971-79 discs.  Problem with the later beam is it raises the front
about 1-1/2" higher.  So you either have to raise the rear or get lowered
spindles or weld in drop adjust sections into the front beam.  We are not
sure discs are really needed.  The only improvement we have heard is they
are supposed to keep cooler than drums.  Have only overheated the brakes
once when we were still using 1955-63 suspension/brakes and only due to Barb
not downshifting and dragging the brakes too much.
  Plus with disc brakes you will absolutely need to install a "Rear Brake
Pressure Regulator" (see VW "Official Service Manual" for 1968-79 bus,
section 8, pages 11-13 to prevent the rear brakes from locking first.
