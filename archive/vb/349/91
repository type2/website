Subject: [VB]  Anyone out there have A project Bus for sale

I'm looking for my next restoration project.  I live in northcentral 
Alabama (Cullman County), and I am looking for a 67> Split Window Bus,  
13-15 window preferably,  or maybe a camper or panel.  It does not need 
to have an engine or be entirely complete.  I prefer a rolling body so 
that I can get it onto a trailer and haul home.  I'm sure someone out 
there within the south east has what I am looking for.   I prefer 
serious inquireys only.  Please Send pics if possible.
   

Thanks,
