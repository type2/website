Hi Rob,
ALWAYS refill the tranny center section anytime you open or drain the RGBs!!! 
 Otherwise about 1/3 - 1/2 of the tranny center section drains down the 
tranny axle tube.  This is set up this way to help the RGB from going dry longer if 
a leak happens.  Giving the VW bus owner longer to find the leak before 
something catastrophic happens.
  Does sound like E-brake lever in the drum is rubbing against the drum.  
Take drum off and look for shiney metal rub area on the E-brake cable end and 
corresponding mark inside the drum.
