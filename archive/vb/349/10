Hey my 64 has on right near the heater knob, it looks just like the
headlight knob. Can be twisted can feel it turn a switch inside it and
can pull it like a choke. If this is what you have i know what it is. It
was for the gas furnace heater, swerat warner was wht mine had in it 18,
500 btu worth of heat. I traded it doe the full middle bench and back
bench seat.
