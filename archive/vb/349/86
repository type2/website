Subject: Looking for Butterball..

I know this sounds weird, but last Sunday at a Porsche show I bought some
slash rear bumpers from a guy named "Butterball"(good price too).  I need to
pick them up but have lost his number.  Anybody in the LA "scene" know this
guy?  I recognized him, but not sure from where.

P-mail me if you know him, his number or email or can help me get in touch.
BTW I asked him why he was not at the OCTO show, and he said because "they"
don't like me...hmmm.

That show was pretty good for VW stuff that the Porsche guys had no use for.
How about a nice unscratched set of original logo'd front glass for $30 and I
found a cool Matra drum puller for $20.  I love it when people look down on
the VW.  Pays to look where others are not.

TIA.

Steve
