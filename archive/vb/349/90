Subject: South African Solex Manual

All,

I have passed along a scan of a Solex manual (more a guidebook really)
which is now on thesamba.com for download in their "manuals section".
While it is a little light on technical details, it does go into the
"hows and whys" of carburettion, as well as having some great exploded
diagrams.

I hope that it will be of use to someone out there in the broader VW
community !

Regards
James
