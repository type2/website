It seems right.  When I accellerate, the advance (using timing light) goes
from the 7.5 degree mark to the 30-32 deg. mark, and falls off immediately
when I let off the gas.

I would check the vacuum advance system to make sure you are getting full
advance and full retard at the appropriate times while the engine is
running.
Just my two cents,
