Subject: aluminum / magnesium repair with HTS-2000 brazing rods 

Do--It-Yourself aluminum / magnesium repairs ? 

http://newtechnologyproducts.net/aluminum_repair.htm

..."new technology brazing rod, anyone with little or no experience 
can repair cracks, holes, leaks, rivets, broken ears, threads 
or fabricate aluminum, cast aluminum, and cast iron quickly, 
easily, and stronger than new!"

"This high-strength brazing rod allows you to repair aluminum 
stronger than a welding machine, without the machine. 
All you need to repair any metal stronger than new is a heat 
source (propane or mapp gas), a turbo tip, or oxy-acetylene"...

"This new repair technology performs well on aluminum, 
cast aluminum, pot metal, copper, magnesium, and all 
white or porous metals. You can easily repair corroded 
or oil-impregnated areas that can be next to impossible 
to fix using welding machines with aluminum welding rods 
or other brazing products."

Debunkers welcome:)
