Subject: Distributor Choices

Hi All,

I am done (basically) with the engine swap as of last night, but now need to
make the engine run better.  Both engines are identical except for the
amount of wear.  1600 dp, with 30/31 PICT.  The old engine I am replacing
had 009 with electronic (in the distributor) ignition.  The new engine came
with a vacuum advance dizzy marked as follows:  0 231 137 035 then under
that:  113 905 205T

I think I can put the ignition module from my 009 into the vacuum advance
dizzy.  Looks like it.

The thing is, I am also putting stock exhaust on it instead of the headers
and bugpack thing.  This could explain why it feels more choked as opposed
to when it was in the other bus?

Sorry for rambling...I don't have time to make sense!

THanks,
