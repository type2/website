Hi Gene.
Could be!  Could also be you need to take the distributor apart for a good 
cleaning and regreasing.  Our 113 905 205T distributor was cruded up this way so 
it did not fully advance or even drop back down very well.  As for the 
smaller exhaust affecting accelleration, you might be running too high of RPMs for 
the engine.  Borrown or buy a tach and see where 3,000 RPM (-at-) what MPH is in 
1-4th gears and 1,500 RPM is (-at-) what MPH in 2-4th gears.
