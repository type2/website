Subject: Bus Cover question

Hello Ron,
Checked out the bus cover.

http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=A0273

Looks good to me, think I'll order one. One question however.....
many splitwindow buses have a radio antenna mounted on the front.
In my case on the extreme right hand front just below the passenger front
window.
Typical location for many splitties I think. Do your covers have provisions
for this,
such as slits or zippers or is it one size "is supposed to fit all". Picture
in the example
looked like a bay window bus with no antenna.

thanks,
Mike
