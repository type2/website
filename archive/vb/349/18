Subject: RGB to spring plate bolts

All,

Some questions about the reduction gear box to spring plate bolts.

It has been recommended here (by Eric&Barb?) to drill these holes
deeper and use longer bolts.  Is it possible to do this without
damaging the existing threads, or do you have to drill the whole
thing oversize?  Is it even possible to do this while the RGB is
in the Bus or is it better to take it out and put it on a drill
press?

Would using studs with nuts on them work at all?  The problem I see
with this is what happens when you want to remove the rear axle; you
might not be able to move the transmission/axle tube/RGB outboard
enough, or the rear end of the spring plate inward enough, to get
the RGB free.  The main idea here is to avoid beating up the female
threads if the rear axle was being installed and removed a lot.

Thanks!
