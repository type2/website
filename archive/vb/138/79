Subject: Re: [VB] Welder on an extention cord?

I have a Hobart Handler that runs on 110, and we took it out to Idaho when 
getting the 54 kombi that hadn't run in ? years, as the throw out arm was 
broken and it was either disassemble the tranny to replace it or weld it back 
together.  used an extension cord.  worked on bus in the dust by the guy's 
shed for three days and drove it 500 miles home very tired and dirty.

 I've got a Lincoln wire feed Mig welder (model sp-100 or something). 
 I was wondering if it could be used on an extention cord? I can make 
 one up with big wire if needed.
 
 Suggestions?
