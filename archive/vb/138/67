Subject: bus roof rack

Hey everyone, I know that the old roof racks are being reproduced for busses
and I was wondering if anybody knew where I could get just the arms on the
top of the rack that secure the bars that go around it. I am building a
teardrop trailer and need these top legs for a modified kind of roof rack
that will go on top of this trailer. I dont want to use OG stuff just repro
so as not to offend the bus gods, thanks
Brian
