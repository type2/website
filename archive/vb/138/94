Assumptions:
* you're keeping the orange/red tail lights
* you're keeping the Euro turn signal switch
* you're going to install a heavy-duty flasher in place of the stock
  turn signal flasher (the stock flasher is only rated for 2 bulbs;
  it will flash 4 bulbs but its life will be reduced)

(Option: Keep stock turn-signal flasher and add a hazard flasher)

Then you need two relays and a switch.  The switch turns the relays on,
and the relays bypass the turn signal switch to make both sides of the
Bus flash.  (Option: you'll also need a flasher)

The relays can be any 12 volt automotive type relay.  The terminals
should be numbered 85, 86, 87, and 30.  If it doesn't have these numbers,
it's not the right kind of relay.

The switch just has to be a single-pole, single-throw switch.  It has to
carry less than an amp of current so the rating isn't too critical.  Any
US-spec split Bus hazard flasher switch will work.

Terminal 85 of both relays is grounded.  Terminal 86 of both relays goes
to one side of the switch.  The other side of the switch goes to a source
of fused battery power.

Terminal 30 of both relays goes to the output wire of the turn signal
flasher.  (Option: To the output wire of the new flasher.)

Terminal 87 of one relay goes to the "L" wire at the turn signal switch
and terminal 87 of the other relay goes to the "R" wire at the turn
signal switch.  If your relays have 87a terminals, leave them unconnected.

Finally, move the turn signal flasher's power wire at the fuse box from
the ignition fuse to the battery fuse.  (Option: leave the stock turn
signal flasher wiring alone, and run a wire from fused battery power
to the power terminal of the new flasher.)

In pictures:

                       `-----> to existing turn signal switch wiring

87             87 -----*----- "R" wire from turn signal switch
|                      |
|                      `-----> "R" wire to bulbs
|
`----------------------*----- "L" wire from turn signal switch
                       |
                       `-----> "L" wire to bulbs

If you take the option of installing a separate flasher, the wiring
for terminal 30 becomes:

30 -----*----- 30
        |
        `-------------- new flasher ----- fuse ----- battery +

I hope this helps!  Please let me know if you have any questions.
