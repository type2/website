Well, guys (and gals),

I'm off this weekend to pick up my newly "restored"
'62 Panel from the body shop this weekend.  Rich Yost
has finished the body work, paint and other work on my
panel, and Ronnie and I are going to get it.  Taking a
train to western AZ Friday and we're going to the LA
area Saturday morning to grab the bus and other
goodies (ask Ronnie), then back to Havasu to get my
6v, small nut trans, 40 horse, hasn't been drive in a
couple years, bus ready to drive from Havasu to
Albuquerque (550 miles).

Please keep me in your thoughts this weekend, and I'll
report anything more than a great adventure driving an
almost completely stock bus cross country.  My first
long distance bus experience was from Corpus Christi,
Texas to the LA area in July of 1963, and I hope this
one will be as uneventful, other than driving my newly
painted baby home.

JP
