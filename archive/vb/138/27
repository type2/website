Did you drain all the fuel completely out of the carburetor when
the engine was stopped?  To do this you either have to disconnect
the fuel pump and run the engine until it dies from lack of fuel,
or take the carburetor apart and shake all the gas out of it.  If
there was any gas at all in the carburetor for the past 5 years,
you will have to take the carburetor apart, soak it in cleaning
solvent, and THEN dry it out with compressed air.  My Dad's Bug
sat for over two years with gas in the carburetor and we had to
run it through the cleaning solvent twice to get all of the old,
dried-up gas out of it.

Also, use fresh gas.  Don't try to use gas that's more than 6 months
old.  It would be a good idea to replace all the rubber fuel lines,
the rubber grommets around the metal fuel lines, and inspect the
metal fuel lines for rust and corrosion, too.

Good luck!
