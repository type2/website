Subject: New EMPI steps

   I just picked up a bunch of the NEW (old style) EMPI steps. These are the
ones with the semi stamped steel bracket and the offset pads with EMPI
molded in.  Cost is 85.00 a pair plus shipping. For a pic go to
http://www.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/pix/50893.jpg. The only difference
from the pic is that they are zinc plated instead of powder painted
