I thought the Faraday cage effect had to do with an AM radio not
working when your physics teacher takes it inside a grounded 
chicken-wire telephone booth.  :)  
http://www.powdercoating.org/industry/faq.htm seems to indicate that
the problem is with recessed areas, not reflective surfaces.  This
makes a little more sense to me.  The net effect is the same as you
mentioned, though - it's hard to get the powder into the channels.
