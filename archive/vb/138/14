Do you have a john Muir book- flip to the 'VW doesn't go " section- it needs 
gas, air, spark

remove distributor cap, turn ig on, and turn engine round by hand- you shouls 
see a spark jump across the point when the engine turns about TDC.  Put cap 
back on.

Does it have gas? pull line off carb.   point it away from your face or 
electrics.   Have a friend turn key for a few seconds-  does the pump pump 
fuel out?    Does it have gas?  clogged lines?  What if you pull the in line 
to the pump off- gas should flow out of it.  I have had to run buses out of a 
gas can if they sat for too long and gummed up the lines and tank, till I 
could pull the tank and install new lines.

If it starts if you dump a little gas down the carb, though soon dies . but 
doesn't start normally, it's a fuel issue, perhaps carb is clogged/bad.

I recommend changing the oil after it has been running a few minutes- get the 
old stuff out of there, and check the oil for it mayget dirty and need 
premature changing.   Just do round town driving for the first few hundred 
miles.

 Who might have an idea of what I might have missed to start the engine of my 
 67 microbus deluxe.The engine was silent for 5 years, but was running when 
 stopped 5 years ago. Ignition was prepared as per guidelines of technical 
 review, and the carburator (1 single progressiv) was cleaned with air 
 pressure.
 At the end, engine simply does not want to start, although if I put gasoline 
 straight in cylinder...
 If anyone has an idea of what is wrong...I would appreciate some help on 
 that one. >>
