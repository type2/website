Subject: Re: [VB] og front floor mat color?

the green/white, red/white, and white/white 6-67 deluxes came with tan floor 
mats and seat stand mats, like the blue/white ones came with blue mats.  
your mat came out of a 66-67, and I bet the high beam switch hole was roughly 
cut by a PO.

 Part #vw 211 863 711E, I thought all the dirt and debris would come off
 and it would be black under there, but it is still a light brown color
 after all the scrubbing.  What's going on here?  It is a walkthrough,
 and the mat between seat stands is a nice color black after cleaning
