I dug out another German 009 and moved the Pertronix over. Either moving
the Pertronix jiggled it into working OR it was in the Dizzy. I have a
nice strong TDC signal now.
thanks to any who were going to respond,
Craig
ps - I guess I will be digging around for more German 009's.

Craig, are you sure your original .009 didn't have bad shaft bushings and
wobbles around?
