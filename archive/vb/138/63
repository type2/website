Subject: Using tire paint on worn out floor mats

My floor mat is already ripped almost in half, and has a hole cut in it
for hi beam switch, and is brown, so I did some quick google searches,
and found some companies advertise their "tire paint" for restoring
floor mats, mud flaps etc.  Until I get a nice new mat (low on the
list), I thought I might give it a shot.  Anyone ever try this?  If so
where might i go to get a smaller quantity?

Just curious
