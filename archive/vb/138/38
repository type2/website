Subject: 2/3 front seat question

I am installing a 2/3 passenger seat in my 66 bus.  When I bought the bus
the seat was in it but just kind of laying there.  I see there are two pins
that hold the front of the seat but what holds the seat bottom down.  There
is a small hole below the frame on the right side and a short platform on
the left side.  Is there a special clasp to secure the seat?  Anyone know
where I could find a diagram of the seat hardware or where I could find the
fittings?  This is my first split so I don't know what to compare it
against.
You have all been a great help with my project.

Thanks
