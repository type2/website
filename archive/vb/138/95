Subject: RE: [VB] Anyone have Sundial tent pics ?

Thanks Ed! It was actually "oldschoolvw" that posed
the question. I have a Westy and would never own a
Sundial, the "bastard-child" of VW campers. :)
(Suddenly remembering the guff he received last time
he dared to post a joke on the list , Sean writes the
following sentence)
I am JUST KIDDING everyone. Just trying to have a
little fun, even on a Thursday.
