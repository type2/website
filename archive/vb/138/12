Subject: Westy hitch parts (Do you need any?)

Looks like selling repro westy hitches will not be
viable.  They will cost too much for what the market
will pay.

I am probably going to make some of the parts for my
own use.  Is anyone in need of the following?  I could
probably make a few extra's.  Not sure of the cost yet
though.

Westy "U" bolts
Westy Electrical mount plate
European Electrical Socket  (Part that is on the
hitch)
European Electrical Trailer plug (Part on the trailer)
Westy Bumper mount backing plate

Thanks
Matthew
