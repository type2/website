Subject: replacing outer pop out seal

I'm putting new roof panels in the westy and so took the whole camper kit 
out.  Oh- it was a german sold bus, so has no louvers, but the rear two side 
windows are pop outs.  I had painted the bus a few years ago, but removed the 
pop outs to paint the bus, but didn't do the pop out frames.   The stuff in 
the closet was a bit damp,   I figured I'd oughta replace the outer seal on 
that window, as I can get to it with the closet out.  So I found a correct 
size screw driver, set it to the screws.

...and the screws just came loose.   Wow.  

cut the old seal out with a razor blade.   Wasn't as hard as I thought to get 
the new seal on, using spray lube.  Though I put it on backwards at first, so 
I had to start again.

Had to have help installing to, as the window frame needs to be pushed up to 
the side with the hinge so the screws will line up, and the new seal liked to 
push it away.  Installed the (greased) screws.
When I shut the window it fit nice in three corners, but the lower right had 
a wierd gap pucker.  I'll have to open it again and try to scoot the seal a 
little so there is more in the corner.   Dont think it'll be easy to open it 
for a while, but how often do you need a window in a closet?
