It's not that hard, but it does take some time and grunt work.  I'd plan a 
weekend with help from a friend. Maybe an extra day if you haven't pulled a 
tranny before

My record for starting with an assembled, driving bus (bumper on),  to having 
the tranny out and axles off - by myself -  is three and a half hours.  


===========
 I imagine the same swing axles and all that can be used and the RGB bodies
 just flip flop with each other.  Hopefully this is all that is necessary.
...............
remove engine
remove tranny
remove RGBoxes and axle tubes

I'd remove the axles and check the fulcrum plates

install early RGbxes/tubes- bearings good? make sure on correct sides
new shift bushings?
install tranny in bus
new axle boots/gear oil
new fuel line, engine to body seal, etc?
install motor.

ta da!

freeway flier- i think is aka for a 3.88 r&p.I got that in my westy, and the 
gearing changed hugely.  (The previous tranny turned out to have a 4.12r/p 
and a bug ,89 4th)   There is something about splined vs keyed shafts, and 
needing to alter the shaft so it'll take a .82 (bus) 4th.  I never messed 
with gear stacks, think you need a jig.  There is info in the bentley, could 
read that.

 Anyway, with the 1.26 RGBoxes and 205 75 14 s this gearing was a big high 
for my 1600sp, and it felt sluggy and could not take advantage of the 
gearing, in fact I was unpsyched.  Changed to smaller tires and it was 
better.  Plan to eventually put a 1679 in it.
