Subject: Anyone have Sundial tent pics ?

Hi......I am looking for pics to put up my 1965 Sundial Tent

is there a website somewhere that shows how the poles go....

I am pretty sure its complete , but do not know what it looks like up

Also will it fit on any bus ?   the Sundial is long gone , 
but I have 66 Kombi to mount it on if necessary

thanks for your help....
