Subject: hehr crank out windows

hey folks,

i have a '65 e-z camper kombi, with the crank out windows, one hinge on t=
op,
crank in the middle. stamped into the top of each window is "HEHR L 2186"=


Two of my cranks had been replaced by the PO now the others aren't quite
working too wellto not at all. So I tried www.blainehardware.com-pointed =
there
by Hehr Windows. I sent some samples in-my original, and the replacement.=
 They
can remake these for around $12-13 each. The little plastic glide is betw=
een
$4-5/for two. they come two to a pak.

There is a small discount on these if purchased in bulk. Unfortunately th=
ese
take about 6 weeks to make-they have to "shop alter" them-i guess on an
individual basis.

I need 3, but i may just get 5-so that they are all the same, and i have =
a
replacement.

Anyone else interested-let me know.
