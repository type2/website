Good for you Ronnie! I want to see that picture!! 

Here's an idea: Line the buses up side-by-side facing the camera and
turn all the emblems upside down. Hold up a sign that says "NO SUPPORT
CAN GO BOTH WAYS"

   My wife has wanted a new car for a long time now. It's to hot for her
to drive her rag top beetle, she won't drive any of my buses, so I went
out and bought her a NEW car. I really would of liked to get her a VW
product, but with all the BS that VW is doing I followed suit and bought
her a PT Cruiser (at least it looks retro) instead of a VW product (I
really wanted a Eurovan).. I am going to take a pic of it in front of my
6 buses and her bug at my house and send it to VWoA customer relations
with a note saying " I would have bought one of your products, but with
no support of VWoA in the vintage community I refuse to help support you
(VWoA)

sighed  a loyal vintage VW owner
