If it is only the spring you will be lucky.
Usually it's the return stopper part that's busted.
A lot of these handles I have found at the swaps are broken
there. If your handle tip touches your door, that is probably the
problem. It is caused from letting the handle "snap" back when you
let go. If the busted off piece is still in the bottom of your door,
you can epoxy it back together and be real gentle with it.
FWIW I have a handle with key I got from Gabe that I can't use.
Part #211 837 205 B. Pretty sure it's for pre 62.
I'll sell for what I have into it.
