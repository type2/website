Lincoln says it pulls about 20 amps at 120 V.  You can use it on an
extension cord - 14 gauge would be the minimum and I'd probably only
use that on a 25 foot cord.  For anything longer, up to 100 feet, use
a 12 gauge cord.  Use as short and as heavy of an extension cord as
you can and it should be OK.
