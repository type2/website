Subject: parts YOU should bring to the vintage meet and sell to ME!

Hi All,

I thought I would post this up and see if I could get any response.... if
you have any of these items, either email me or find the tipper at either of
the friday or saturday vintage weekend events in Seattle...

- 1967 bus tie rod ends in good shape.
- nice rubber windshield washer reservoir cap
- 6 or more gas tank divider screws for a 59 double cab (dome head phillips
about an inch long)
- 3 sun visor screws... similar to door panel screws but not quite (I think
at least)
- double cab headliner pieces and of course, any other nice gray panels
would be appreciated.
- Koni bus shocks with the 'wing' logo stamped and the 211 513 035 part
number (or a set of koni 1350 shocks)
- Original wood slat screws... I once thought I had found some and now I'm
not sure as they never have shown up :-(
- heater duct fabric
- '58 ghia turn signal switch... or a just the little 'C' clamp part that
fits into the switch housing
- '58 ghia ignition switch
- Pepco supercharger



TIA
David
... just look for the tipper...
