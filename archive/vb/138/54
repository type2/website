Subject: re:og front floor mat color

the rubber color can shift due to some chemical cleaners...when helping a
friend clean her old volvo i ad some wheel cleaner stuff. i think it came
free with something else i was buying. anyway i never tried it on my bus-but
i used it on her wheels. unfortunately wherever some got on the tires it
streaked them brown-like a chemical reaction, because we could not rinse or
wash it off.

there is some stuff called tire black. i have not seen it for a while, but
just saw it in a old parts store yesterday. i always thought it was just for
tires(as the name suggests)but the container said it could be used on floor
mats. this might work for you; although i would try it in an inconspicuous
spot first.

good luck
