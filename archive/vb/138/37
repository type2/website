Subject: re:replacing outer pop out seal

these seals are a pain in the a**. I replaced mine about 9-10 months ago. I
used some tar where i thought neccesary-due to the fact that after the first
round-i still had some leaking. The tar did not seem to help. I still get
some leaking in there-even though the window appears to be closing nice and
tight.
