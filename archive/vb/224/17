Subject: Dash Hole in 64 Bus

Hello,

I have a 64 highroof that we are fixing up.  It has a factory hole in the 
dash below the gas guage.  It also does have a flasher and we know where 
that goes, but we can't figure out what would have gone in the hole below 
the gas guage.  Anyone have any ideas that would help us to identify what 
goes in this hole?   Maybe a switch that was an option back in '64?

Thanks,

Charles
