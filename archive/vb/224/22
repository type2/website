Tell you what I did...............
Tried to be polite and ask speciics. They kept being vague, so I started 
ingnoring them. I figured I could be vague too. When they finally got 
around to sending me letters (previous contact was via email) I read the 
letters have good laugh and then toss them. When they tried to contact 
me by phone I givr thrm the old "who's calling?, sorry, he's not in" 
routine. They got tired of it and moved on. Probably to you............. 
sorry.
