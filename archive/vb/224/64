Subject: Re: [VB] Hubcaps/Emblem Painting..

I have read in one of my bus restoration books that
the later split models (post 64?) the emblem was
chrome. The earlier ones, the emblem was painted
black.

I think your spray directions are pretty good, you may
want to burnish the inset emblem first to help
adhesion. You can also mask it by covering the entire
thing with masking tape (press it into every curve of
the surface with your fingertips) and cut the emblem
out with an exacto knofe, carefully, using the curves
as a guide.)

 The chrome hubcap emblems were were painted the color
of the VW they were on  up to about 1963.  1964 and up
to 1967 this was simply black painted.  Best way we we
have found to paint the emblems is to simply spray the
paint on and  give a swipe with a cloth to remove the
overspray. 
 Polish out any traces of  this overspray on the
chrome where it does no belong.
