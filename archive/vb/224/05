Subject: Re: [VB] restore or not to

Okay, my two cents....

I am a sucker for all things Australian...make it a bus, and I'm even more 
head-over-heels for it!  I would say get the cargo van mechanically solid and 
weatherproofed (weather? in AZ? ;)  but leave the look as it is.  Although, I'd also 
advocate meeting halfway....restore it, but do it in the colors that the bus was when it 
was logo'd and also recreate the original logos as best you could.

That's what I'd do, at least.  :)
