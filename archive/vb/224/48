Subject: RE: [VB] Good source for Redline MT-90?

Summitracing.com sells it.



Can anyone recommend a good online or local (north FL) source for Redline
products, specifically the MT-90 synth tranny fluid?  From what I'm
reading, this sounds like the best juice to put in my bus tranny and redux
boxes.
