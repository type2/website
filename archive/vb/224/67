Subject: Window doors & popout glass

I scored a pair of '66 doors off a wrecked '66 Kombi
from a friend as well as the glass.
I think the doors will fit on my Panel which was built
in late '66/early '67 but I'm not sure about the
glass.
It comes from popouts and while one of the pieces of
glass still has the popout frame the frame is rusted
to hell.
Is the glass slightly bigger for non-popout glass or
with the correct seals will this glass fit?
I'd like to use it because it is Australian VW safety
glass.
It has a capital A next to a VW roundel with safety
glass printed in a circle around it and,like my Panel,
the bus it came from was an Aussie bus i.e.high vents
on the rear panel.
:o)
