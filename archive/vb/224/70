Subject: Amazing busses

It never fails to amaze me how a VW bus will just keep on running even
when things are completely fubar. My 66 which I drove down form KY
(380 miles) made the trip with no problem (except for generator
failure), but mechanically it made it. A few days ago I posted some
pics of my axle shafts which were, and I quote "the worst I have ever
seen in 30 years of working on busses". I got some new fulcrum plates
yesterday, dang I didn't even realize these had oil paths in them. :)

Well last night I tore apart the 1600 DP that was in the bus. The
middle top bearing stud was actually just hanging out of the case, so
I decided to split the case so I could try and seat it properly. Well
it turns out the webbing that holds the #2 main bearing is now not
part of the case anymore. It seems to decided that becoming 3 seperate
pieces is a much better design & did it on it's own. Oh well, guess I
have to get a replacement motor. At least I won't have to worry as
much about the engine after this :) I'll post some pics of this sorry
engine. Many things were also missing which made me a bit warry, such
as no rear seal. apparently the person who tore into it last time
decided it really didn't need all the seals.
