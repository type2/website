Subject: Relay information and part numbers - was H4 light wiring

The hunt for relays was hard and easy...

I went to Radio Shack and found relays for about $5.99 each... And they 
looked cheap.  So more hunting.

Went to into my garage on Sunday and started poking around in the 944 I am 
parting out...  Hmmm, those look like relays!  Yes, yes they are!

So here are some good part numbers that are helpful in getting relays for 
the headlight wiring:

- Porsche 928.615.203.00 (has a test light hookup in it, but I have no idea 
how that works - I guess easy to see if the switch is good)
- VW/Audi 141951253B  (the one probably easy and cheap to find. No test 
inputs.)

Both of these are rated for 30 Amps, which is plenty.

If you need 50 amps there is a 944 relay (for the ignition switch) that can 
handle it with larger connectors (1/2"? as opposed to the standard 1/4").  I 
doubt anyone needs this, but e-mail me offline and I can supply that PN to 
you.

Also I tried to find the relays that Matt mentioned in the 9-PIN box 
replacement article with little luck and need some direction.

- Where are 5 prong SPDT relays purchased?
- What is the full VW PN for a 12v #559 flasher? (I have no clue what this 
is)


Thanks,
