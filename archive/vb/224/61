Hello!
       I actually work at a VW dealer in the parts dept. They have all the 
fisches (sp?) including all air cooleds up to New Beetles. I've been trying 
for some time to get this stuff but for some reason they just dont seem to 
keen on selling them. Same goes for the old lollipop sign in the cellar. They 
were being used as a backup till about a year and a half ago. Now all they do 
is collect dust in the basement. I'll keep checking. If I can make off with 
this stuff I'll let you folks know!
