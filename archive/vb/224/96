Odd, I've been running synthetic trans oil for the last 7 years, not
problems in any of the transaxles because of it. Old stock trannies, new
stock trannies, and built trannies for drag racing. Never a problem with any
of them. Everyone I know that's run synthetic in thier trannies has not had
any problems either, and that's a lot of people on all the various forums.

Go figure.....
