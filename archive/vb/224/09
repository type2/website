Most of the ones you find, as you have probably discovered, are bright
plated and have the plastic barrels on them.  Most good hardware stores
#include <hardware-store-rant.h> will sell ones without the plastic
barrels but they're still usually bright plated.  I think most of these
are nickel over brass/copper or maybe tin over brass/copper.

I have found the real brass ones in a _few_ hardware stores.  Prowl
around the local Ace and True Value stores, especially the small and
grungy-looking ones, but prepare to be disappointed.

I'm almost sure that there is a reliable supplier of these to the vintage
car market but I don't know offhand who it is.  Maybe Hemmings Motor News
would be a good place to check.
