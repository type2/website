Subject: RE: [VB] Dealer Microfiche machine value?

I think my local dealer that just changed hands has both of these machines.
I scored all my aircooled tools from them, will try and wring these out, if
you guys want them, I have no space for these machines. I saw them though.
Will try and get info and pictures.
Must act quick the building they are in is due for destruction.

  I have the original fiche machine from PIMA VW that used to be in Tucson
and it is different then the fiche machine that I got from Chick Iverson
Porsche/VW dealer that was in Newport Beach, Cal. 1 reads the small fiche
(PIMAS) and the other reqads large fiche (Iversonn)

ps. still looking for the machine that reads the dealer training lp's with
the 35 mm film strips. I have over 60 of the dealer training lp/film strip
with little test booklets
