Subject: Re: [T2] Dealer Microfiche machine value?

I wonder if the fiche's could be read on a scanner at all.

I would love to see someone at the old vw documents preservation site
take a look at the possibility of doing that....be nice to try and 
preserve those things for posterity.

Maybe if the museum would take theirs and get them on cd or something
we could get our birthday papers from them a lot easier.

Cheers, dave
