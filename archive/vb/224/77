i put redline in the old geargrinder and it did make it quieter and 
easier to shift... for a while! while it prolly helps PREVENT wear, 
it can only do so much remedially.
as soon as my new david crow-built tranny is broken in (assuming i 
ever get a motor together) i'm putting redline in it.

the idea behind syn tranny fluid is a bit different than syn motor 
oil - in tranny oil, regular oil molecules can be sheared in two by 
the action of the gear teeth, allowing metal molecule-to-molecule 
contact. metal is going to be removed from one surface or another at 
this point!
syn makers claim that their molecules are so 'slippery' that they are 
harder for the metal to pinch and shear. dunno the chemistry or 
physics, but that's what they say...........
