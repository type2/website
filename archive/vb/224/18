As a common practice, I run a # "O" (OH) drill through all pump stands, new
and used. On the used ones I also sand down the outside a little or touch it
up on a grinder lightly to prevent them from binding in the block from
swelling. I use Permatex 3-H sealant on the top and bottom of both gaskets
even though the pump is packed with grease before installing.

Hey y'all
The previously reported fuel pump problem wasn't the pump after all.  Turns
out the block the pump sits on that the pushrod runs in was warped slightly
and wouldn't allow the rod to return down after a stroke.  I fixed that by
hammering on the rod to get it out and breaking the block, necessitating a
replacement that I just happened to have in another engine waiting for it's
turn on the bench.

Gettin' pretty good at replacing upright fuel pumps in place.  Note to self -
don't put Nylocks on the side of the pump towards the fan shroud.  Limited
wrench swingin' room there.
