Offered up the tubes & played with shims.  Three appears to be right --
with 2, it seems to bind and with 4 it flops around.  Checked this dry
with nuts torqued to 14ft-lbs.  Tomorrow night I'll finger-paint shims
with RTV per E&B and get everything torqued down.

<<<<Use clear silicon on the gaskets, it seems to be more plyable then the
colored RTV's. I have used every clor and brand and find that clear works
the best on the gaskets>>>>>>>>>>

Next step appears to be to tap in the upper inner bearings and the lower
axle shaft, then crank down the 41mm nut with some loctite on it.  Also
per E&B I ground two extra notches on the lower axle to have multiple
staking points for the nut.  Then plugs with RTV and paint the backs of
the plugs.

<<<<< On the plugs I use high temp BLACK RTV, LIGHTY coat the inside of the
plug hole and then put a thin coat on the RGB plug edges and lighty tape in
to prevent warpage>>>>>>>>>>

At that point I'll go ahead and horse the Klingon bird of prey back into
position and get the bolts started, make sure everything's about right and
snug them down.  Outer bearings etc. then seal the redux boxes up.  From
there I'm back on familiar turf.

<<<<<<<On the RGB half gaskets I use Permatex Aviation gasket sealer>>>>>


I have never had a leak from any of the places I have used the above
mentioned sealers, this is from numerous trans rebuilds and numerous testing
of different products over the last 7 or 8 years.

ronnie   been there done that to many times

PS: Much thanks to Ronnie for investigating the nosecone bush issue.  I
will donate my spare plain bush as a door prize at the Lovebug campout. :)
