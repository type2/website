I had this problem in a 65 bug in Alaska. The viscosity of synthetic is too
thin to use as tranny oil by itself. I ended up mixing MPG-2 silicone based
grease and Mobile 1 to make something close to the viscosity and thickness
necessary so as to not leak through the poorly mated surfaces.

Synthetic gear oil caused my older Transform rebuilt trans to leak like
a stuck pig.  The leak stopped when I changed back to Stalube gl-4.
