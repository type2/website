Hi Justyn,
Try this info:

The chrome hubcap emblems were were painted the color of the VW they were on 
up to about 1963.  1964 and up to 1967 this was simply black painted.  Best 
way we we have found to paint the emblems is to simply spray the paint on and 
give a swipe with a cloth to remove the overspray.  Polish out any traces of 
this overspray on the chrome where it does not belong.  This is the only way 
to duplicate the OG painted emblem hubcaps we have collected.
