Subject: tranny oil: Rancho sez....

Sheesh, I shoulda made a 1-800 call a while ago.

I just got off the phone with Rancho.  Told them I had one of their rebuilt swing-axle bus trannies.  They said for their rebuilds any good quality regular 
hypoid 85w-90 like Valvoline, Mobil, Castrol is fine.  GL5 no problem.  Said don't use synth.  No break-in recommendations.

Call 'em at 800-304-8726 if you want to raise hell.  I spent 30 minutes at a FLAPS today while he tried to get the guy at the warehouse to understand 
what GL specs were, and then condescended at me afterwards.

Stopping by the grocery store on the way home....
