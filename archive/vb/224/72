Subject: Looking for a bus?

I don't have the time or resources, to do anything with the bus that I have,
I have a project bus and a parts bus, and a few small bins of misc. parts.
I am located in Vancouver BC.
I am hoping to recover the 2500 dollars Canadian I have spent on acquiring
this stuff.
If interested pmail me.
The only thing that I ask, is everything I have here bus related goes
together as a package.
