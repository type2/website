Subject: Hubcaps/Emblem Painting..

Greetings, Honorable List Members:

I hope this isn't a silly question, but it has been on my mind for quite some 
time. I notice in many of the bus pictures that I see, that some have painted 
emblems on the hubcaps (usually black). Was this done originally, or is this 
just a personal cosmetic choice that people have made? It seems many of the 
barndoor buses I see have this done. I'm thinking of doing mine, but wanted 
to find out the "scoop" on it first. :)

Thanks in advance,
