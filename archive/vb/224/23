Maybe it's my browser, or it's late, but that bus rear image has got a
lot
of spare room back there in the engine compartment - looks like he forgot
to install the GEX (maybe it's already gone out!). cal

It isn't your browser ............. I enhansed the image and the engine
bay is empty.
Guess he's going to buy one if somebody comes with the money.
Somebody should ask if they can have a Jake Raby engine with the bus for
the same price.
