One of the guys in the local club says he uses MT90 in his bike and that
it's more prone to leak, though maybe that's not an issue since everything
on mine is rebuilt, with new seals, gaskets, RTV, etc.

I'm gonna ponder this some more, thinking about Sta Lube GL4 some as well.
I emailed Rancho through their site to get a recommendation from them as
well and will pass on their response.
