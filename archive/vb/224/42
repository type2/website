Subject: Dealer Microfiche machine value?

THe VW size microfiche is not the standard USA size,
its much larger....

You need the big reader to see the VW fiche, unless you want to cut them in 
half.....

the service department started using the smaller fische for some reason,

Porsche  sold the fische to anyone,
but I think VW would not sell them.....
