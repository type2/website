Subject: round mirror question

   It was brought to my attention today that there are different size ball
ends on round mirrors with the change being made sometime in the late 50's
early sixties. I have gone through all of my OG round mirrors and they all
have the same diameter ball on the end of the stalk. So if any of you have
any NOS round mirrors or any on your barndoor etc, could you check the ball
size for me to end this question. 
  The part number on all of the mirrors, including the one with the
supposedly smaller ball are all the same.

ronnie      just wondering!
