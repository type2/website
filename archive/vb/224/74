OK, uncle! uncle!  :-)  I'm going to at least start with Sta-Lube GL4 and change it after 500 miles, then determine my next step from there.

I found the ref you mention at http://www.aircooled.net/gnrlsite/resource/articles/mods.htm:

"If you have a new transmission, do NOT use synthetic initially (during the break in period). You can start using synthetic after your new tranny has 
about 6000 miles on it."

Thanks,
joe
