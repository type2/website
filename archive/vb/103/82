Hi Matt,
Sounds like you have too much fuel pressure from the fuel pump or the float 
and/or shut off valve in the float chamber of the carburetor are bad.

That accelerator nozzle has a tapered base on it which one should tap with a 
slot tip screwdriver and hammer into place to lock it there.  You must first 
aim this nozzle to spray through the opening of the lower throttle butterfly 
valve when it first opens.  This nozzle should came back out with a little 
twisting pulling by hand, but you really do not want it to loose and pop out 
to get sucked up by one of the P&Cs!

Unless you know that Loctite works wil fuel bathing it we would just peen the 
screws.  Installing brass screws would make it far easier to remove them next 
time.

That does not sound good!  Does the bushing fit snuggly in the bore when you 
try to push it in by hand?  If so you probably can get away with just 
pressing it back in.  We would apply high temp silicon sealant to the outer 
diameter to help prevent vaccum leaks there.

Best to just use the gasket.  Using sealant will just make roadside repairs 
harder.  Lapping out the gaps or at least down to .003 should do.  It sounds 
like the DPO of  this carburetor just torqued the heck out of these upper 
screws instead of replacing the upper gasket or fixing some other leakage 
problem.

The main jet sounds a bit too big and the air correction too small.  
Definitely check out the jetting data for the German version of this 
carburetor in the "Without Guesswork" manuals.

  The Without Guesswork and Bentley manuals suggest that there is also a 
pilot

We are away from our collection of "Official Service Manuals" right now, but 
that sounds correct if you mean this jet air bleed can only be viewed with 
the top of the carburetor off.  the pump injection tube is the same as the 
brass accelerator nozzle.

That should be the one way valve and inlet for the accelerator nozzle AKA 
pump injection tube.
