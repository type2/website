Hi Steve,
There are many differant sizes of cam gears to fit engine cases that have the 
cam and crankshaft bores closer or farther apart.  These cam gears as far as 
we know start at +7 for the largest, down to 0, and -3 for the smallest 
diameter.  It sounds like you have a +1 so go back to the shop that supplied 
you with the cam and see about buying a -1 and see how that fits.  If still 
to tight try a -3.  If either of those are too loose go one size bigger.  You 
want a slight click slop between the cam/crank gears that is more feel than 
visable.  If you do not have this properly done nasty things can happen.  We 
know of one type 3 owner who installed a +3 in an engine that needed a -3.  
About 30 miles down range the cam gear was shoved off its rivets!
