Subject: RE: [VB] pop-out latch refurbishment AND CHROMING GOODIES

My chromer is near Portland OR... he'll tell you 3 weeks turn around and it
will end up being 8 but then again, I haven't heard much different about
others... I think they're just like anyone else in trying to balance work
loads.
Anyway, you can reach him at:
Vic Vanderstar at Starbright Chrome in Molino Oregon (1-877-247-6634)

Tell him Dave the VW bolt guy sent you his way and he won't speak to you
ever ;-)

Charles asked:
Where can we take/send out things to be chromed, like a bumber?  Any what if
its pitted and rusted pretty bad?
