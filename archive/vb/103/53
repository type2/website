I am rebuilding an engine for my 66 bus.  It came with a type 3 engine =
and I
had the case cleaned and checked  by a machinist and bought a reground =
crank and cam and
bearings.  Everything was going back together well until I tried setting =
the
cam in.  For some reason it will not go down into the bearings.  I have =
a
1/4 inch gap on the bearing closest to the cam gear and it sets in the =
one
at the flyweel end.  I have reseated the crank a few times and I am sure
that it is setting correctly.  It looks like they do not mesh together.
My question is this.  Is it possible that the timing gear has a =
different
pitch than the cam gear and it would prevent it from seating properly?  =
I
looked on the cam and there is a number one.   I have heard somewhere =
that
there are different sizes.  Is there some trick to making this set =
properly
or should I buy another cam?
