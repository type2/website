All,

In May I'm going to travel to the East Coast, but not in my Bus.
I'm going with the University of Tulsa's hybrid vehicle team to
the Tour de Sol, a series of displays and races for alternative-fuel
vehicles put on by the Northeast Sustainable Energy Association.

Stops on the tour include Baltimore, Washington DC, Sandy Point
State Park MD, Philadelphia, Trenton NJ, and New York City.  There
will be displays in each city, rallies between the cities, and
races and competitions in some cities.   

Bus content: One of the entrants in previous years has been a 
bay-window Bus converted to electric power.  The team that built
it consists of fourth through eighth graders - none of them are
old enough to drive!  This year, one of the entrants is a 
converted Vanagon.

I'll probably be pretty busy during the tour, but if any listees
want to drop by and say hello that'd be great!  The TU car is
a blue Geo Metro and will probably be #17 again this year.
