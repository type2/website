Hi Thomas,
We fabricate our own.

  Did you retain the item popularly known as the "Hoover bit?"  I have the 
Berg kit

Yes, we use the Hoover bit and lengthened it.  Plus reinforce it so it does 
not break off like it does even with a stock length.  There is plenty of room 
between the type 4 cooler modified doghouse tin and bell housing.  We have 
been able to install the upper left engine mounting nut by hand in this area. 
 Then we install the two exhaust tins from the cooler.
