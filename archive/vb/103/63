Hi Eric,
Well hopefully that will help it out!

 This engine has been sitting for 13 years so it all needs to be replaced. I

We doubt it will do well or last long.  The biggest problem with parked 
engines is the last fellow almost always never changes the oil after the last 
running of the engine.  Once about 6 months passes the gasolene that had 
gotten into the oil during start ups has turned the oil into a nasty acidic 
state.  This attacks the engine interior components and even can eat it's way 
through the engine case itself.  Plus any water vapor that got into the 
engine case from the burning of fuel produces water which rusts up any steel 
and iron parts.  Especially cam, tappets, crank, connecting rods, and 
cylinders.
  When Eric got our white 1963 SC out of a back yard in Texas where it had 
sat for 8 years the engine died due to rusty crankshaft journals about 50 
miles later.  The engine had just been rebuilt before it was parked due to a 
pulled rocker shaft stud!
