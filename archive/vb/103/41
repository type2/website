Click and Clack did this little skit about 5 months ago where they had 
people write in and vote on what they thought was the worst car ever.  They 
had to explain why they felt so, also.  They simply put together the 
responses they got and presented them as humor on their radio show.  It is 
not meant to be scientific or even the last word on what cars are really bad 
and what cars are really good.
