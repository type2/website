Yup, same bus.  John has been working to restore the rear where there was
fire damage.  The front 75% is really nice.  The rear still has some issues,
but very easy to restore.

As far as I can tell it is the original case for the engine.  Single relief
and all that.  Good power from my rides in it with John.

I can vouch for the new generator and voltage regulator since I put them in
with John :)   

The price is very reasonable from what I have seen.  E-mail me off-line for
more details if you are interested...  Still need to hound John as to why he
is selling it, was news to me when I saw it FS!
