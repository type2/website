Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome '02 dates?

I can't answer you for sure on the brothel.  I do think that it is more of a 
"historic" icon than anything else.  I will say that besides the ABC's Jerome 
Jamboree event, the town of Jerome, the Gold King Mine, and the surrounding 
area are not only really historic (for the Southwest), but pretty cool to 
check out while in the area.  Just one more reason to come to the event!!

Hope to see you all,
