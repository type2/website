Subject: redbarn parts list

Hi All,

Prior commitments will keep me from this weekends festivities at redbarn and
kp.... but I'm wondering if I can put a few thoughts in whomever's mind is
attending for a few parts that I'm looking for....

- pair of original mudflap brackets.
   (see <http://www.dsquared-dev.com/davem/wheels.htm>  -for a picture
- original battery ground strap.  This should have a copper battery post
clamp
- a few old style band clamps and heater duct fabric in good condition.
- a nice pair of 67 bus wiper pivots.
... and if you find any thing, give it to Greg Noble in his *new* 55 westy
with the circus tent....

Keep your eyes peeled and thanks in advance.... and I hope to return the
favor someday.


David
