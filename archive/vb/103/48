I asked for more information, I might pick one up to play around with.
At least it could be a possible simple spare to many VWs.
Best, a nice runner, hoping it would fit with a stock aircleaner.

Wow, I didn't know anyone was still making this carb. There was an
article in one of the 1960's Popular Mechanics about the history of this
design, but that's all I thought it was, history.

To start off, a link: http://minnowfish.co.uk/carbs/intro.htm
I am not looking for unbelieveable claims of lots of gas mileage or
power, they seem a bit too good... Does anyone have experiences with
these carbs? It seems as if they don't require jets to tune, and are
supposedly more efficient. This might be an alternative to Solexes,
although most of my problems are probably due to my ignorance and lack
of tons of bodies, parts, or decent bushed lower halves of the solex
units. Al
