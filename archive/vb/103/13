Subject: RE: [VB] Carbs again....116?

Mikuni's are the same MAINS, they look slightly diff, but screw in,
sizing similar. I have them, but only 120,100,90,lower. I would like an
elusive 116 jet, if anyone has one.

I'm running a 125 with that exact set up (similar to 100 cam I think)
and mine (brand new 30/31 stock 40 hp air cleaner) is running really
rich.  I'm going to try around 117 and see what that does.  Once warmed
up it does run really nice...no hint of a stumble.

What size Mikuni carbs do you ask for.  Are the mains the same?????
