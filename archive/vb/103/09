Hi P&C,
When the VW is at high speeds the interior is at lower pressure then the 
exterior air.  Thus any leaks are sucked through and water wells up inside 
the VW.  This is the reason VW dealerships would suck the air out of VWs 
through the heater system to water test the seals.  Also VW factory and 
dealerships used a special sealant on all none opening windows to prevent 
leakages.  We have after much experimentation use roofing tar to seal these 
and repel rust from forming under the seals.
