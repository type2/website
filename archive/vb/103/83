Chris --

Went out and crawled under my bus for you.  The front passenger brake line
(mine is still the original) runs along near the top of the rear side of the
"bulkhead", then drops down an inch or so in an "S' curve after it passes
over the accelerator cable. It then runs into one side of the "T" fitting.
The "T" is mounted on the rear side of the bulkhead, straight in alignment
with the master cylinder. (The driver side line comes to the other side of
the "T" in a simple, short curve.) The line from the bottom of the "T" goes
down about 1 1/2" then passes through a grommet in the bulkhead into the pan
area and curves toward the driver side, about an inch-plus above the bottom
edge of the bulkhead. It then makes a vertical 180-degree curve (shy of the
clutch cable) downward and into the rear fitting of the master cylinder. The
passenger side brake line (where we started) is clamped to the bulkhead just
to the outside of the heater air duct, and the "T" is of course bolted down,
too. So, it looks like your second drawing, except you showed the "T" on the
wrong (downward or "front") side of the bulkhead.

Hope this helps!
