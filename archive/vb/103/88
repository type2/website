A little.  Between my native ability, http://babelfish.altavista.com/ ,
and http://europa.eu.int/eurodicautom/login.jsp I can usually make
sense out of things.

>"Gebrauchte Anh=E4ngekupplung f=FCr VW K=E4fer vor Baujahr 1960 mit unsync=

BabelFish says:

Trailer coupling for VW beetle before year of construction used 1960=20
with unsynchron / teilsynchrongertriebe. Unfortunately without vehicle
identification plate and besides something " deposited ".  Mounting
elements are missing, are however as copying hurry without problems
to refer "=20

Which I would clean up to:

Trailer hitch for pre-1960 VW Beetle with unsynchronized or partly
synchronized transmission.  No identification plate, something
encrusted on it.  The mounting brackets are missing, but you can
get reproduction ones.

The last sentence is the one I'm least sure about.  I'm sure about
the "mounting brackets missing" part but I'm not sure what he's
trying to say after that.

I haven't had any formal classes in German.  All of this comes from
online translators, studying German phrase books and a couple of German
VW books, and hanging out around my sister who has a degree in German.

<disclaimer>
What I'm trying to say is that I'm not an expert in German and that
towing something with your Bug is a potentially dangerous activity,
so you have to decide for yourself what kind of hitch you need and
how safe it is.=20

>How much is "EURO 6,00"?

About US$6.00 .  Punch "foreign exchange" into your favorite search
engine to get today's rates, but in general, a Euro has been about
a dollar since the Euro was introduced.

Note that German standards for decimal points and thousands separators
are pretty much the reverse of the US ones.  One million five hundred
thousand forty-two and a half is 1,500,042.5 in the US convention and
1.500.042,5 in the German convention.
