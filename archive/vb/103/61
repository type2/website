Subject: Re: [VB] pop-out latch refurbishment?

Thanks to David for the tips. I am still curious, like Charles asked
about chroming. If the part is pitted and the chrome is flaking how do
they get a nice finish with the new chrome? Is the old chrome removed,
and how do they do this? Thanks again, Chris
