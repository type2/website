R, any old timers,

Yeah, I remember those Renault Dauphine's.  They were stiff competition
for the Bug in the early 80's.  They disappeared in a hurry though.  I
remember as a kid driving my dad's '56 oval and feeling smug over the
Dauphine's.  I got in one once and noticed how everything was plastic,
plastic, plastic, . . . the kind that disintegrates upon exposure to
sun.

Reminds me.  Between my Jr. and Sr. year I worked on a cleanup crew for
an 80 unit apartment complex on Florence Ave. in Santa Fe Springs . . .
for the benefit of ewe Angelenos. It had covered parking in the back and
along the side.  A guy I was working with had an old Model A his dad had
restored.  It was in pretty good shape, as was my '56 Bug.  We had a
couple hundred yard drag race down the parking lane.

Anyone care to guess who won?  Its Friday.
