Subject: Re: [VB] Check out this custom bus!!!

I used to live in Wilmington NC, then moved North to
New Bern NC.  I drove past this bus every couple
weeks, and it does look pretty sweet.  Sad to say, it
is quite a let down up close.  The body work is older,
filler cracking out and paint flaking.  The interior
wis as described below, almost non-existant.  It is my
favorite billboard though.  Definatley catches your
attention.
