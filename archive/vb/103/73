I like that Thom,
subtle, but fun.
I went over to that site and even tried searching
tried member David Kelly
tried search terms custom and bus
not much luck
didn't want to wade through the 200 bus photos

David, The URL that is at the top of the screen will not point us to your
photo.  The ASP part of it is the dead giveaway.  The ASP will fetch the photo
based upon your search parameters and then build a webpage on the fly for you.

Oh well,
Scott
