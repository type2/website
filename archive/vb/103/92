Hi Jose,
OK, our best ansewer to a minimum of data offered.
1.  You will need a complete doghouse cooler and tin setup.  Get the 
thermostatic flaps also if you drive in areas that get below 70F.
2.  You probably have an earlier single relief case so you will need:
     a.  Three step studs of 6mm and 8mm on half of thier lengths and install 
them in place of the one in the case and two in the dog house oil cooler 
base.  Yes you could drill the ears of the case bigger, but this weakens them 
drasticly since these do not have the bigger thicker cast ears of doghouse 
cases. 
     b.  Two tapered seals to mate the small oil passages of the engine case 
to the doghouse large oil passages.  Do not use the copper plated washers 
that often come with these seals.  These washers are only for installing a 
early oil cooler on a doghouse case and then go between the two.
