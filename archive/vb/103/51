Hi Bertrand,
Not sure what "LJ/REG" means, but "/180" = 180 Watts.  /6 =6 volts.  /25001-8 
(or 3) means nothing to us either, but it is a probably a L3 not an 8.  By 
the parts book which is also online in "Obsolete Aircooled Documents" webpage 
this is a 113 903 021 B used from engine 5 000 001 up to 8 209 812 and was 
superseded by 111 903 021 H.
