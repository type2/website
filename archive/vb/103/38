Subject: Re: [VB] Friday question, Ned Ludd...

    Joe Clark is right in that the original Luddites were not against
technology per say but were pissed off at losing their private,
personally owned jobs and quality of life to the industrialization of
the weaving biz.  Factory jobs, unhealthy towns, lack of freedom...  If
they could have gotten their hands on some better technology to meet
their desired ends, destroying the mills, we would all be wearing
clothes that last for decades.
    VW Bus content, in a round about way, I'm reading Susan Zakin's book
on the birth of Earth First! and the environmental movement, Coyotes and
Town Dogs.  There she describes the desert trip to the Pinacate area in
Sonora, Mexico in a VW bus in'79 where the idea of Earth First! was
first tossed around.  Zakin tells of Dave Foreman selling his Ford pick
up to get the classic desert rat vehicle, a 1960's VW minibus with "
paint rubbed raw by sandstorms and beating sun".  The bus lacked a
working starter and was named  "Parks on a hill".  Foreman and Earth
First! started a press in Tucson in order to print the book  Ecodefense:
A Field Guide to Monkeywrenching.  The name of this press was
Ned Ludd Books!!!    Gary Gibson   Tucson, AZ
