Subject: pop-out latch refurbishment?

Hello fellow bus drivers - can someone please explain how to refurbish
regular short pop-out latches. I have a dozen or so in various
conditions, some broken pieces, bad chrome, etc. I was thinking I could
at least put together the best pieces to make a few good ones. Do the
little white knobs pull off or unscrew ( I've tried twisting them with no
luck ) and to take apart the pivoting parts would you drill out the hinge
pin rivet thing? Then could it be put back together with a tension pin?
On the good parts that just have bad chrome, what can be done? Can chrome
be removed, and then could they be powder coated instead of chromed? 
Thank-you, Chris the clueless latch owner
