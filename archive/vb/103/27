My 2nd wife lived two blocks from the Shell refinery in Deer Park.  Had a
white and black speckled 67 Ford Fairlane when I met her.
I had a 67 westy and we met kayaking on the upper Guadalupe.  I used to
pile 7 big old fiberglass boats on top of it.
I remember camping in it with all the jalousie windows open and feeling
like I couldn't breathe.  Mosquitoes and stuff too.  Now I'm spoiled.
