Subject: Re: [VB] Carbs again....

I'm running a 125 with that exact set up (similar to 100 cam I think) and
mine (brand new 30/31 stock 40 hp air cleaner) is running really rich.  I'm
going to try around 117 and see what that does.  Once warmed up it does run
really nice...no hint of a stumble.

What size Mikuni carbs do you ask for.  Are the mains the same?????
