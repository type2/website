Yes more air mass helps with heat transfer ( although only slightly )  
so more humidity = slightly better engine cooling.  Rain may help  
cooling by splashing water on the bottom of the engine which keeps  
things cooler.
At sea level more air mass so cooling is better.

Main factors for engine temp are ambient temp, ignition timing, gas  
type (octane, alcohol, etc), jetting etc
