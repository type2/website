This is my fantasy, as every time I price something like this I  
realize I'm not a wealthy person.

I have considered buying a marginal-quality rebuilt long block with  
the intention of tearing it down. But that's about as realistic as my  
intention of buying (which I did at one point) WBX 2.1 to convert into  
an OxyBoxer.

The end result is that I have a 1500 SP that was rebuilt in '82. :-)
