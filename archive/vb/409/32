Subject: Re: [VB] Trip Report and Gas MPG 

This discussion involving specific heat, viscosity, and coeficients is fascinating. It gets me thinking too. 

The specific heat of
water is 1 calorie/gram 0C = 4.186 joule/gram 0C measured at 250C which is higher than any other common substance.
2.080 joule/gram for steam measured as a gas at 100 0C
magnesium is 1.02  joule/gram 0C
aluminum is  0.897joule/gram 0C

As a result, water plays a very important role in temperature regulation. The specific heat per gram for water is much higher than that for a metal.


Thanks for the ideas.

I added .030" shim at the base of the cyl to lower the compression ratio and help keep the engine cool. It runs great but I haven't read temps.
