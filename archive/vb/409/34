I had been thinking more along the lines of misting something colder like
nitrogen into the cooling air stream. Anyone thought of that or done the
math?

Yes more air mass helps with heat transfer ( although only slightly ) so
more humidity = slightly better engine cooling.  Rain may help cooling by
splashing water on the bottom of the engine which keeps things cooler.

At sea level more air mass so cooling is better.

Main factors for engine temp are ambient temp, ignition timing, gas type
(octane, alcohol, etc), jetting etc
