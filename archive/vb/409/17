I tried a smaller generator pulley (the small 6V one) and found that my oil temps went down significantly.

In fact, the engine barely got into the 170-180Frange when driving hours on the freeway to go camping.? In a rainy March or April day.??And had a bunch of camping?stuff in the Hardtop?SO-42 westy with 7 ft steel roof rack.? When I went back to round town speeds, it cooled down to where the engine was not?properly warmed up.?
 It was in the fifties.
?I swapped back to the regular pulley and belt and could get the engine to warm up.? yay!!!
The small gen pulley may be a good thing if you are in a hot climate or the heat of summer, but not so good on temperate days.

So, I guess you should keep an eye on the temps.
Swap back to the regular one if it gets too cool.?? It doesn't take very long to change a pulley and belt (unless the pulley is stuck to he generator)
?It's?like the three bears, you want it not too cold, and not too hot, but just right.? :)
YMMV.??
