Hi Kevin,
	The wavey/spring washers are a problem when they break.  The clips  
that hold the rockers together will soon break afterwards and then  
the rocker arm will move places you do not want it to go.  You'll  
need flat washers of various thicknesses to fix this.  Buy a kit  
designed for this repair.  Pull both rocker arms apart and get rid of  
all of the spring/wavey washers.  As Gene Berg use to say, "don't get  
clipped!".   Gary Gibson
