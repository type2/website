Subject: Re: [VB] David Mayes - R.I.P.

Could someone please update TheSamba discussion:

Just notes and random thoughts. I'm sure that Clara/Greg/Lind will  
update when they get back to civilization.

Clara, Greg, Lind and I attended David's Mass together this afternoon.

There were about 250-300 folks from all walks of life in attendance.  
(or to put it another way, one to two percent of La Grande's entire  
population.)

The Boise contingent set up a table in the reception area with  
miniature buses and a loose-leaf notebook with a color printout of  
the samba discussion through early this morning.

The priest (Fr. Hank) is a car guy. (fitting)

Anna seemed to be doing okay.  Was surrounded by v. large family.

David looked just like his dad.

Burial tomorrow.
