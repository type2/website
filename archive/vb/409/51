Subject: spring washer on rocker arm

Well I was just giving my bus an overdue tuneup..and noticed that I am once
again missing one of the wavy washers/spring washers that hold on the rocker
arm, next to #2.

I checked my records and this is the 2nd time this has happened in 3 years.
In less than 8,000 miles.

Three questions:
1. Does this indicate a bigger problem I should be worried about?
2. Where did the washer go? Last time this happened, Boston Bob(who built
the engine) said it was in the bottom of the engine, and not to worry about
it. He sent me replacement washers then.
3. Where do I get these washers, as I'm sure I'm out of warranty?

Help, as usual greatly appreciated..
