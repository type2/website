Wow Jamie, you really blew it. 8^) A 21 window Deluxe for $250 and that 
wasn't a good enough deal? Hell, that was even back in the day when a 
Canadian Dollar wasn't worth more than a U.S. Imperial Petrodollar. I 
paid $1000 for my 21 window in 1980 and though it was a good deal.

Muir's book and the story by Gurney Norman, "Divine Right's Trip", which 
appeared in The Last Whole Earth Catalog, were both major influences in 
making me determined to have a bus. It had to be Red and White too. The 
bus in Divine Right's Trip was Red and White.
