Decided to chime in on this one.

My Dad was taking the family camping in our 64 DD camper bus around that 
time. In the fall he would take my brother and I up into the Sierras or the 
coast range for deer hunting too. Had some good times in that bus. I later 
took my family camping in that same old bus. Its lookin pretty good these 
days since the restoration.

Here is a photo of it in my driveway.
