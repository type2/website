Subject: Re: [VB] was spring washer-now stretched valve stem

Hi Kevin,
	The valve stem with the "dent" in it needs a lash cap.  This is a  
machined cap that slips over the valve stem and supplies a smooth  
flat surface to the rocker arm.  Your broken wavey washer probably  
was caused by this damaged valve stem, though I recommend that you  
replace all of the springy washers with flat washers of the proper  
thickness.  You probably will have to dress down the sides of the  
valve stem a bit for the lash cap to fit.  Good luck!  Gary Gibson
