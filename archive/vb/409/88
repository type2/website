Subject: was spring washer-now stretched valve stem

Well I was driving around town the other day, came out to my bus, and saw a
puddle of oil under right side of engine. Not huge, but enough for concern.
I checked, and it appeared as though the valve cover gasket was leaking.
Unfortunately I did no have spares with me, as I usually do. Fortunately I
was near my mechanic. I drove to his shop. I pulled the valve cover, and
went to replace the gasket. I then noticed that the spring washer on the #2
cylinder rocker broke. Again.

I asked my mechanic to take a look, and we couldn't figure it out at first.
Then he noticed that the end of the valve stem was concave where the rocker
hits it. This was only on one stem-all the others are flat. So I am thinking
that the valve stem stretched due to overheating? And the rocker hammered it
concave?

Any ideas what I'm doing to my engine here, or how to fix it? 

By the way, after the valve cover gasket replacement-the oil leak seems to
have been solved.

Thanks,

-Kevin
