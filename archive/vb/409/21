Why, yes it was.
I prefer not to pay extra for the fancy brand when I can get the low cost version.? ;)

I think I may have had to place small shim between the pulley and the generator to line up the belt evenly from gen pulley to crank pulley.?
? Then?I had to figure out what size belt it needed, which meant a couple trips to the autro parts store.
