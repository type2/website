 Oil temps stayed around 220-230 F while cruising at 50-55 mph: higher thanI'd
like, but something that I've come to be ok with. Hopefully a shift to15" rims
will help this by bringing down the RPMS ... go go gadget RubberGearing!
------------------------------

15" rims is not going to change gearing. The diameter of the tire does. Taller
14" tires will slow the engine down. BUT it also slows down the cooling fan!
