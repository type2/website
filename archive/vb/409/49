All good questions. The normal high-performance mods done to VW engines are
for increased performance at the drag strip, or for light-to-light races on
the street, or just to let that rude Lexus driver know what your bug can do!

Unless you plan to take your bus to the drag strip, the heavy weight of
buses is a whole 'nother story. Bus engines are designed for the torque
needed to get them going, and if you put in an engine that takes away that
torque, you don't have a very happy driving solution. So while you want that
street demon bug to breathe, and you put on the extractor exhaust, ported
heads, big cylinders, wild cam, etc, for the bus you need the single port
head, stock cam, stock exhaust, and if you want to modify it, do a stroker
crank. I hear Ronnie at oldvolks.com builds a mean 1800 stroker that really
cooks for buses. In an upright motor, I would make sure the crank is
counterweighted, and the entire rotating mass should really be dynamically
balanced for maximum engine life on the weak magnesium cases.

Oh, I would lose the 009 distributor too. It is really only appropriate on
high performance carbs where the throttle is not very far open under most
driving conditions, thus forcing the vacuum advance to remain nearly always
advanced.
