From the Idiot Manual, "How to Buy a Volkswagen" chapter:

"On the first of August, 1968, my old '58 bus made the fatal error of
  breaking down in the mountains causing untold travail so we patched
  it up and made it to Albuquerque looking and seeking.  We went to the
  two Volkswagen dealers first and found out that an early '64 bus would
  cost $1095 and it was, we decided, about what we wanted but we didn't
  have that much bread.  We bought a paper and found and ad that said:
  "Volkswagen Station Wagon for sale - 1963, gas eater - good condition -
  (the address)."

The story goes on; the dealer would sell the '64 for $995 with a 3
month, 3000 mile guarantee, but Muir ended up buying the one from the
newspaper ad for $675.

Just as comparison, http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl says (to
three significant figures)...

  1968   2008
$1095  $6,890
  $995  $6,260
  $675  $4,240

VWoA doesn't currently sell anything that looks like a Bus.  VW AG sells
the Multivan, which is arguably as close as you're going to get.  Their
price list for the 2009 models ranges from EUR 24,920 (about US$38,700)
for a Multivan Startline, 1.9 l TDI, 5 speed, 62 kW (about 83 hp), all
the way up to EUR 46,050 (about US$71,500) for a Multivan Highline,
3.2 l V6 (Otto), 6 speed, 4Motion, 173 kW (about 232 hp).  The prices in
Euro don't include "MwSt", which is some kind of tax on cars in Germany;
it adds about EUR 4700 to the cheap one and EUR 8700 to the fancy one.
