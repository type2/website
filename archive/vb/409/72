 Hi Clara,
 Was reading your post and it raised a question in my mind. Your comment
 about the 12volt system being "still pretty new and not
 yet considered reliable." I hadn't heard or read that before. Was that an
 issue back in "the day?"  VW offered 12 volt as a customer option
 for some time previous to the '67 model year I've read. Not trying to 
"flame
 ya" just curious what your thinking was as you wrote that.
 I sure agree wth ya on one thing. I'd love to find a ten year old '58 
(maybe
 stuck in a "time warp?")
 Reading between the lines, I think Muirs '58 was probably "high time" as
 they say in
 the aviation world. He put 17 grand on his "new" bus in a bit
 less than a year. Like you, I kinda figure that 36 horse just wore out.
 He claimed to do lotsa "back country, off road" stuff.
 The main thing I took from Matt's piece was the prices then and now
 (adjusted for inflation)  You've probably heard me relate the story of
 buying my '66 bug new in San Diego while in the Navy. It was 2,300. dollars
 with
 financing then. Seventy five bucks a month car note out of a monthly
 income of $400.00 seemed a bit high back then. How I wish I could have
 that kind of payment today though! I still own the car and every time I put
 gas in it
 I'm amazed at the price. Two bucks to fill-up in 1966, twenty-six or so, to
 fill-up today, ugh!
 My 15 window bus that I've owned almost 15 years would be a financial
 struggle for me
 to purchase at todays prices, even though it's forty five years old. Go
 figure.
 Mike
