Hey your a LOT further north than me!
I am at lat: 43B021'0"N. Longitude (lon): 80B018'0"W
Potlatch State Park is 47.36N  long 123.15 W 

That is 4 deg.. or 280 statue miles or six hours in the camper ! lol 

no wonder it was cold there! lol 

Where I live and camp in Ontario Canada is as far south at Roseburg Oregon.
I have my fingers crossed it will be warm and sunny! :-)
