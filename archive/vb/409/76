Subject: Bus article in Skinned Knuckles

There is an article by Bill Siuru, who writes the foreign car column, in the
current issue of the magazine "Skinned Knuckles" which is a "journal of car
restoration".

The article has some errors, but gives a fairly good history of busses,
primarily splits.  If anyone is interested, it's in the August 2008 issue
(Vol. 33 - No. 1).  Back issues can be ordered at www.skinnedknuckles.net

I've been subscribing to this publication for a number of years, and it has
had some very good articles of all sorts - history, tech, shop hints, and
more.
