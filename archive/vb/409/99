Chuck,

Thanks for the compliment.
This is an extremely rare camper by Kamper Kits of Cupertino, CA, USA. I
believe that they mostly converted American vans.
Only seen one other and it was only partially there. The interesting feature
is a narrower closet that leaves room for a 4x8 sheet of plywood on the
folded down bed!!
