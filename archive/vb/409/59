Subject: Problem in the head (valves)???

Hey All,
I went to adjust the valves on my 1600 DP in my 71 Westy and found that the #1 valves would not adjust.  No matter how far I backed them out, I could not get even the thinnest feeler gauge in there.  Did a compression check and I got ZERO compression on #1 but very good compression on #2 (140 psi).  The starnge thing is that I have noticed no loss in power or performance?!?!?
Soooooo, I am assuming that it is a valve issue on #1, sound right??  Is there anything else that would cause this?? Other possibilities? I have a replacement head to put on, but if there are other possible culprits, I'd like to know about them before wasting my time with installing the new head.
PEACE! John Baker
