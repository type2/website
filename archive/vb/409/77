Subject: Re: [VB] It was forty years ago today...

In 1980 , I had a chance to buy a 21 window, 66 or 67 ish, with a new engine
in it..  He was asking $250.00 and it was in great shape body wise,, I have
no idea about the mechanicals....  I knew he was in arrears for $150..  so
<cheapskate me> I offered to pay the mechanic and tow it no charge,   D'Oh !
I didn't find out until after I missed out on buying that one how much fun
buses are !

  my 1957 Beetle was sold at an "OK" used car lot in 1960 .. listed at
$990.00  and the fellow I bought it from bought it from them with a 10
percent discount.. total of $900.00

too. My double cab was purchased for $8500 in 2006.
