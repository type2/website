Subject: Re: [VB] Trip Report and Gas MPG and oil temp

I thought I knew vw engines, but now I feel like a complete novice. 
There is so much complexity. One example my stock sp1500. It has a 
stock exhaust,  which is obviously a restrictive exhaust pipe.
I read that this is designed to maximize "low end torque".  Lots of bug 
mufflers were installed on busses and holes drilled in the bumper for 
the pea shooters-the shop I worked at at age 18 in 78. made it standard 
procedure. Then people use higher flow extracter exhaust systems. So 
which should a stock engine use ? what rpm is considered low end. I 
have realized that any mods must be done with the knowledge
of how a change here will make a change elsewhere. this effects 
driveability. You get flat spots and other problems. I worked on 
motorcycles as a mechanic at a honda dealer.  When we would modify a 
bike for performance (customer request) - most popular was exhaust 
pipe. OK so now we needed to change the air filters for more flow and 
rejet the carbs. A lot of work and almost impossible to get the 
original driveability. Most guys with a crotch rocket just cared about 
wide open and put up with any flat spots.
Very humbling when one calls himself a mechanic.

I type too much BS- what muffler do I use for my stock sp 1500 with a 
009 distributer
