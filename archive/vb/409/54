Subject: Re: [VB] spring washer on rocker arm

Hi Kevin,
	The spring washer pieces are now in the case somewhere and I  
wouldn't worry about them.  They're not going to get past the oil  
screen.  There are kits out that you can use to replace the spring  
washers with regular flat ones.  The goal is to use the various  
thickness washers to eliminate the freeplay between the rockers arms  
and whatever they run against.  The spring washers break because they  
are old and worn thin or maybe you've installed stronger valve  
springs which will break them.  Just eliminate the springy washers  
and you'll be fine!
