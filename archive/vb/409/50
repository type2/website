Subject: High Torque For A Bus

Since having a torque motor is always what bus owners want, I thought
I would also suggest that going with a type-4 motor is another
alternative bus (and bug) owners have.  I've got a basically stock
2.0L T-4 motor in my '66 E-Z Camper and I can tell you that torque is
NOT a problem.  If you upright convert the cooling, it's a bolt-in mod
that requires no cutting of the precious bus metal and looks like it
belongs there.

I've built several 2.0L bus motors using a Web #73 cam and 8.0:1 CR
for clients over the past few years and I get nothing but smiles for
the power and torque these motors produce.  You usually don't even
need to use 1st gear with a type-4 since they easily have double the
torque of a type-1 motor.  Oil temps are normally 180-200F (-at-) hwy
speeds and head temps average around 300-325.  The added finning on
type-4 motors sheds heat from the oil and heads much faster than a
type-1 so cooling is never a problem if the motor is built right.

This post is not meant to get into a type-1 VS. type-4 posting war.
Type-4s are not for everyone.  I just thought some may want to know
that there are options out there for high-torque engines other than
just ones based on a type-1 engine.
