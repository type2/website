Well thanks for the suggestion and tips on fixing this.
I ended up getting a whole rocker arm assembly from my mechanic, he just
pulled it off a pile of engines he had in his storage area. This included
the shaft, 4 rockers, and all little hardware...

It's in, and adjusted, and I'm driving again..

Thanks,

-Kevin
