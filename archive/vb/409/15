Subject: Gearing & RPM in a 63 singlecab

I?went to a 3.88 Rancho R&P with the 63 one ton option 'little-big nut' RGB's. I have 205-75 15's for tyres, and my 1600 DP burbles along at 3000 RPM at 60 MPH.

It is a neat setup thanks to Clara and Greg.

I will be driving my singlecab up to Olympia WA and the VW shows on July 16th.
Probably about 2000 miles round trip from Cupertino CA.
Anyone need a load taken upo to the gret PNW?
PS see you at Vintage Meet on July 19th?
