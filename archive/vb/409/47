On a 1776cc engine, I would vote for a aftermarket extractor exhaust with 
quiet pack muffler. There is a noticeable difference in power on the freeway 
over the stock exhaust. The noise difference is negligable.

 Hi again Frank,
 Computer sent last Email off too soon!
 If you are running a 1776 or smaller engine, lower than 4,000 RPM, and not
 drag race it.  Best stick to a stock 1500/1600 muffler.
