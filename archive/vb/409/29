I have. I ran a long temperature probe (indoor-outdoor
thermometer) from the engine bay of my air-cooled '80
Vanagon to the passenger seat.

I took a gallon pressure sprayer and rigged it up to
feed water into the intake louver on the left side
(away from the electronics) and to a mister fitting.

I could turn the pressure container on or off with a
valve.

I was driving a consistent route every day, so I could
repeat the experiment. I'm in the foothills of
California so we don't have a problem with humidity,
so where I am located would be ideal for the test.

Bottom line, I couldn't measure any difference in
intake air temperature with or without the water, so I
discontinued the experiment and didn't proceed to full
implementation.

If it could be implemented with the mister just ahead
of the cylinders, it might work, but I didn't have a
CHT sensor to be able to check.
