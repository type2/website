Subject: Re: [VB] Trip Report and Gas MPG and oil temp

Hi,
	A good place to begin dealing with heat and fuel economy is to buy  
91 octane gas and adjust the timing to run best on it.  Really, use  
91 and increase the ignition timing.  Try adjusting the timing to  
around 30-32 BTDC at speed and see how it runs.  At higher elevations  
you may get better cooling and performance with more advance.  Don't  
worry what the timing is at a slow idle.  With a 009 distributor the  
advance at idle will likely be at least 10 BTDC.  Gary Gibson
