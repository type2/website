We went camping a LOT when I was a kid.
I also rememeber how we drove from Michigan to California when I was about 
two.??? I think it made a lasting impression on me.

Amyhow, we'd go camping all the time.?? It was great.? even after we didn't have 
the bus anymore.?? We had a '55 Chevy station wagon?and it'd tow the boats on a 
trailer.? (for camping by a lake or sailing in the ocean)
I hear that camping is getting more popular now, with the current economy.? (ie 
can be a cheap vacation)

My brother is not very impressed with VWs.?? 

Redwood bumpers were cool at the time.?? So were bell bottoms, and long hair on 
guys.? And chickens.? Evidently having chickens was?very hip.? 
And that light orange color was a cool color.? And that curved print font.

People will look back at narrowed beams and raised steering boxes and tubbed 
front wheels just like they do at the seventies/eighties mods.
