Hi Tom,

The change is immediate. The engine runs cooler with synthetic. Per the tech
discussion on type2.com, Mobile 1 and Redline are the only true full
synthetics on the market now. I use Mobile 1 because it is cheaper. The 5
quart jug comes on sale at Walmart frequently for $18 to $24.

Was the change immediate or did it take a while to have an effect?

And (dare I ask) what weight/brand are you running?
