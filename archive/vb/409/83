Here are soime pictures of us camping in 1972 in our 63 Kombi.

I really did not know what a gem I had. Did not know about VW roof racks, or campers. I built the interior myself, and had rear facing child seats from England.

I did not know about the kiddy cot, so had a sheet of plywood with a steering wheel cut out for my son to sleep on.

But it was a lot of fun and we saw most of California.
