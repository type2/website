CIP1 has the wavy washers for a couple of bucks along with the
hairpins and flat washers.

Were your wavy washers sandwiched between a couple of flat washers?
It's kind of suspicious that the same one broke, maybe there is a
slight burr on the rocker or it's worn in an odd way?  If the rockers
were switched around on the shaft it's possible the face of the rocker
that is against the washer was previously against the riser block,
maybe they wear differently?
