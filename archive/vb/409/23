Howdy All,

Finally received the Birth Certificate for my bus.

ID number:  1 164 691
Model:  215 Delivery Van  *Loading doors both sides
Engine: 42bhp, 1.5 liter
Color: L 380 Turquoise,  ** Upholstery Grey
Built on: September 6, 1963
Shipped on: September 11, 1963
Destination: San Francisco
Extras:  M 425 Mountings for Safety Belts.

Its on a nice grade of paper suitable for framing. I'll most likely hang it 
inside the bus.

Quite the bare bones unit. However the dealer had a nice camper installed.

Chris
