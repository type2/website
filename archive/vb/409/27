I read that yes that it true.? Specifically, that when you drive in the dy desert, when there is little moisture in the air, that there is less 'stuff' in the air to take the heat off your engine, but when the humidity is higher, the moisture in the air has mass to take the heat from your motor.?? So it run cooler at 80 F and 90% humidity than 80F and 20% humidity.

We?help our cooling?with evaporation, which doesn't work as well with high humidity.

I have always wondered if running in the rain was sort of like water cooling. I am not kidding.?
Anyone ever experiment with water and the vw engine. Motorcycles (air cooled ones) sure run cooler in the rain?
