Subject: Re: [VB] Birth Certificate

Isaac,

Go to this Samba post.
http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?t=95862&highlight=birth+certificate

Go to page 3 and find the post dated May 20, 2008 from NOVA Airhead. There 
you will find the link to the application as well instructions for filling 
out the on line application. The on line app is in German, the instructions 
do a good job of translating.

It took about 5 weeks for my cert to arrive.

It is a little pricey at 35 euros, about $56.

Worth it? That is in the eye of the beholder.
I've had my bus for 36 years and was with my Dad when he picked it out on 
the lot. I have some sentimental value here.

Chris

Isaac asked:

 Would you mind telling me how you got the birth cert. I remember
 reading somewhere (i think on the the Samba) about that.
