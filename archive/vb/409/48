Right. Thinking of liquid nitrogen. Dry-ice seems like too much of a hack.
Maybe bottled liquid CO2 would have the same effect. I remember a college
physics demonstration of how fast liquid nitrogen froze a hot dog solid, so
I was thinking that would be a good source of cold cooling air if misted
into the air stream. Can't be too expensive if racers can afford it. Of
course, a burst of nitrogen for a speed boost will make that bottle last a
lot longer than a continuous injection into the cooling air.

as I understand it our air that us and our engines use is about 80 percent
