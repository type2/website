We went camping a LOT when I was a kid.
I also rememeber how we drove from Michigan to California when I was about two.??? I think it made a lasting impression on me.

Amyhow, we'd go camping all the time.?? It was great.? even after we didn't have the bus anymore.?? We had a '55 Chevy station wagon?and it'd tow the boats on a trailer.? (for camping by a lake or sailing in the ocean)
I hear that camping is getting more popular now, with the current economy.? (ie can be a cheap vacation)

My brother is not very impressed with VWs.?? 

Redwood bumpers were cool at the time.?? So were bell bottoms, and long hair on guys.? And chickens.? Evidently having chickens was?very hip.? 
And that light orange color was a cool color.? And that curved print font.

People will look back at narrowed beams and raised steering boxes and tubbed front wheels just like they do at the seventies/eighties mods.

Sweet pics! Now isn't that the life? Makes me wish I was out in the
great outdoors now!
I love the 4 x 4 redwood bumper! Adds a bit of nature to the bus.
Isn't that what it's about? Not just perfect restorations!
PS - I'd like to know what the kids think too!

Boy I really was naive.
