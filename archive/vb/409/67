Subject: Bus driver in need of assistance - George Utah/Las Vegas

We have been contacted from the AIRS list by Jane of Seattle area who is 
currently in George Utah and plans to head towards LA via Las Vegas 
later today (leaving about 11am). 

Her 76 Westy is running ok, even with the heat, but needs at least an 
oil change and valve adjustment.  

Looking for help.  Kids not doing well with the heat so looking for a 
cheap room in Vegas or other alternate places enroute. 

We have her cell number but no email.

Appreciate any help, contacts, or ideas.

P & C
