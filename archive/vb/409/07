John,  

My webserver recently went away, so I no longer have pictures up.   I'll see
if I can't get them up sometime soon though.

That said, my bus came with the interior...uninstalled.  So I've found some
pictures online of what it was supposed to look like, and, I have most of 
the pieces to get it back to that state.

That said, the original interior was pretty ugly and not necessarily functional.
As a result, I might be going more custom and for an almagam of the original, 
a standard westy, and my own bits.  We'll see how it turns out.

Anyway, I'll post pictures when I get them back up.

Cheers,
   Tom
