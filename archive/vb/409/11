Subject: TR Addendum: Gauges are Good! (was: Trip Report and Gas MPG)

Quick Addendum: 

About 50 miles into my trip, I noticed my oil pressure start to drop off.  The
engine was good and warmed up, but as I started to hit ~30 psig (at cruising speed)
I took notice. 

I found a nice place to pull over (empty parking lot) and took a look under
the engine to see exactly what I expected: the valve cover gasket had a very
slow leak.  I had checked this before departing (ran the engine for 5-7 minutes 
in the driveway), but I guess the gasket was sealing "good enough" to keep the oil
in until I got moving and the oil started sloshing about.  

So I dutifully hit the gasket with some RTV (left the open tub of bearing grease
at home...although on second thought, it might be in one of the cabinets), 
topped up the oil, and was on my way.  I was down about 3/4 of a quart from full.

So, once again, gauges are good for qualitative data: they tell you when something
is "off" from the norm.  

Side note: my oil pressure gauge has been doing this thing where it will periodically
just stop working.  In these cases the idiot light seems to still work (and not
come on) so I haven't been too worried, but it is annoying.  Thoughts?  I'm thinking
it's either a bum connection (but everything seems good) or something else.  
Next step is probably to pull the sender and clean it and/or put a different
gauge on there to see if it works any better...
