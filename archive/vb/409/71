Thanks, Matt!

Funny, the gas eater turned out to be a gas Heater, IIRC.
Other thing, a '58 was a ten year old bus.??? I don't know what it did in the break -down, maybe the?36hp engine?wore out.??
I think any of us would be very happy to find a '58 bus in ten-year old condition.??
 It would be so nice compared to how they are today with so much worn or needing catch up.

The Idiot book was first published in 1969, when all VWs were air-cooled, the dealerships had all the parts you need, there were independant VW shops all over the place, and split buses were not very old.?? 
A little basic maintenance, and you're good to go.
In 1969 the first 1600 sp engines were available.??? They were sold in the new buses, and I doubt were widely available in junkyards yet.
People were still hot-rodding 40hp and 36hp motors.

The 12V system was still pretty new, and not yet considered reliable.

It also seemed that VWs were cheaper then, aiming at the lower end pricing... now they are aiming for higher up in market scale.
