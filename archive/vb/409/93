Kevin,

How long have the heads been on that engine? If it's been around 40K 
miles I would go ahead and do a valve job. I haven't shopped for new 
heads lately, but unless VW heads have gotten hard to get, it's probably 
cheaper and easier to just buy new ones to replace the ones on your 
engine now. If one valve is acting strange and causing a lot of trouble 
it is time to get rid of it. The last thing you need is a dropped valve 
out on the road somewhere, or anywhere for that matter. Was the concave 
ended valve sticking out of the head more than the other valves? You 
mention "stretched stem" in your post, so it sounds like that was the 
case. I'm sure valve stems stretch over time, but what I've seen when I 
replace my heads is major valve seat recession. The valve seats wear 
down and as the valve follows the seat into the head, the stem moves 
closer to the rocker arm, closing the gap you put in there when you 
adjusted the valves. After enough of this you can't adjust the valves 
any more and then it's time for new heads.

I just read through what you wrote again. I would definitely plan on 
replacing the heads soon. You can't adjust the valves properly if the 
end of a stem is messed up and valve adjustment is critical, especially 
in a bus.
