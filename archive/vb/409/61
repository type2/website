Subject: RE: spring washer

The washer is right next to the rocker. I replaced it once before, a couple
years ago. I'm just trying to figure out why this would happen, and can I
replace it with just any washer that fits, or do I need to use a special
high-strength washer?

I don't even know where to get this kind of washer-I know I've looked for
washers like this before at local hardware stores, and had no luck.

Based on responses so far, sounds like it is not something to worry about,
just replace it, and keep going. It just seems to me that there must be
something that is causing this.

What goes up the middle of the washer? A bolt or a shaft? Where's the 
bolt/shaft?

Maybe the washer is cracking and falling out?
