Hello Guys What I did was to go to a boat store and get 2 of the bouy mate 
cup holders these will swivel I also picked up an extra set of attacters and put 
them in my canoe so that I take the cup holders from the bus canoeing with me 
 Got mad at spilling my beer in the canoe.  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
