The best time to resolve a warranty issue
is prior to purchase, and with written copy.
A receipt with "engine- $xxx " is not one.
This engine is most likely a used core with
all the visible parts ( carb, coil, fan belt, etc.)
replaced. The cracked case, damage hidden
by the flywheel ( installed uninspected )
is essentially a "mystery engine" containing
all used components, and may or may not
last the 6-month verbal "warranty". It's replacement
will be equally suspicious, and it is very likely
no inspection of the exchange will be allowed.
This merchant is still in business. It is more likely
this procedure has been successfully applied
to numerous preceeding unwary customers.
An independent inspection from an authorized
repair facility would reveal the defects and
potential legal situation, which will be more costly
than the value of the replacement.

When the defect was discovered, this customer
did not directly resolve the warranty issue, but
proceeded with additional work-for-profit, which
lead to additional questionable repairs, again with
no written work contract, and was overcharged.

Diane hopes to gain a complete working knowledge
of the bus this week, and compete with the merchant
on his own level.
