The brake pedal should contact the end of the master cylinder with about
1mm of free play. Then it should have some pressure for the first inch,
but should not be difficult to move. After the first inch, it should be
harder to push down, but not difficult at all. Just firm, and the bus
should be slowing down and stopping at this point. Pedal should not go to
the floor at all, Should be at least an inch or more up from floor at full
stopping power.
