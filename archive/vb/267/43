Doug,
Looking at the 1966 USA wiring diagram at http://www.vintagebus.com

I find a couple of things.

1. the circuits that you speak of are fed from the ignition switch.
2. The combination that you mention is very revealing.  The blinker and 
wiper are on the load side of the fuse and the fuel gauge is unfused 
directly from the ignition switch.

Few questions for you.  With the ignition switch ON,
1. do your brake lights work?
2. do your oil, generator lights work?
3. does the engine start?
4. Do you have a voltmeter or 12V test light you can use?
5. With the ignition switch on, does a test light light up putting it on 
both sides of the 2nd fuse from the right?

The common thing for all these items you mention is the ignition switch.
Check your connections and we'll go from there.
