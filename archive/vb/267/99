Subject: 6V Starter

I have a 6v starter that I can't get to spin.  The solenoid works great,
but I just sits there and won't turn.  I've tested it on the ground and
in a housing with the correct bushing, but no go.  I even hooked up a
12V battery to it and still nothing...started to smoke though.

 I pulled the end cap off thinking I would clean up the brushes and
comutator, but my soldering iron would not get hot enough to remove the
brushes from the bracket.  I shot motor cleaner in and blew it
out...still nothing.

Is it toast? Are new 6v starters available?  Anyone have a good one I
can buy?

Thanks!  I have to get this motor running!

Steve
