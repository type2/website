Weren't two-windshield buses made after '67 in South America or South Africa or 
Australia? 




I've heard buses called bugs as recently as yesterday. Maybe it's short for 
buggy?




Spent the weekend in the Sierra at 7500', a cool 40f at night. Kaiser Wilderness 
south of Yosemite, north of Sequoia. The '63 DC ran smooth & under 210f the 
whole way over a 10,000' pass.
