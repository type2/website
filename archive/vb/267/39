Subject: Dormobile owners, I need help!!

I started the Dormobile conversion on my camper this evening, but I have a few questions regarding measurements, and mounting 
locations/procedures.
If you have, or can get pictures, etc. from your Bus for me I would appreciate it.

Drop me a pmail with a phone number and I will give you a call with specifics.


Thanks,
Greg
