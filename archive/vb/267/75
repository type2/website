I seem to get plenty of front row notice with my daily driver. The unknowing
always ask me how hard was it to cut up a bus to make it a truck!

 Sure, it's nice to be in front row but I really believe if
your *rig* is worth seeing, it WILL be noticed AND appreciated.  Most of
the populous relates to the deluxe bus so even if you were in front row
with your truck, they'd merely pass you by.

I say don't sweat it and enjoy the show.


BTW, for the 'split window' thread, how 'bout the term 'rig' :-O
