During the "drag the bus out from under the tree stage" [I was going to call
it restoration, but it just doesn't feel like that.] MrMechanic said "order
some wiper arms."  [and a gas tank] So I did.  When it was getting close to
time to drive the bus home, MrMechanic said "order some wiper arms."  I told
him "I did, they are here and you have them someplace.  They were in the box
with the gas tank."  He held them up and said .. "that's not what I meant, but
you need them too."  So I went back to the Wolfsburg website and ordered what
he was calling arms, that weren't really arms, they are 2 flat metal strips,
left and right, one longer than the next.  They came and he said .. "that's
not what I meant, but you need those too."  He said .. I need the part that
sticks through the holes in the bus that the arms attach to.

Meanwhile, by this time it was time to take my bus home.  So I coated the
windows with Rainex and drove away with the wiper motor sitting on the
under-the-dash-shelf connected to a wire .. Does this motor work one might ask
??? I have no clue ..  Apparently there are more pieces that I need.  Someone
said "could it be the transmission?"  I don't know .. I know there must be
something that attaches to the flat metal pieces .. something that I attach
the arms to .. and something that holds the motor instead of the
under-the-dash tray.  Before that was installed .. the motor just bounced
around - banged around is more like it.  I was going to secure it with duct
tape but the dash tray came and I didn't need to.

So two or three questions.

Can someone tell me the names of the parts I need ?? Where to order them ??
Or does someone here have those parts to sell?
