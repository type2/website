I have one that was made by a list member, if I remember correctly it was
Richard davis who fabricated these. I think it was a one run thing...it is a
fairly simple device the screws to the under side of the dash(I actually
used a pre-existing hole, so there is no need to drill).

I don't know if he still makes them...if there were enough demand he might?
