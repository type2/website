Subject: Ambulance fan rubber seals

Hi All,

After putting it off for what seems like an eternity, I realized that I
needed to post up a question to maybe build some consensus so I can
continue... 

Here is the dilemma:
On a normal fresh air vent plate, three sides are sealed with black
rubber strips and the forth side uses plumbers putty.  However, if you
look real close on the service bulletin regarding the installation of
the ambulance fans, it appears that the fourth side has a black rubber
strip instead of a mass of goo... 

So, I have the plumbers putty, and I've also scrounged for a very nice
set of (4) black rubber strips.  What should I use?

Anyone out there with either og installed ambo fans or possibly some og
dealer installed fans that could lend me some advise as to what is
correct?

By the way, Todds comment in the 'Truck show class' thread; "I doubt
even David Mayes truck could pull off a win (when finished) which is
a..." spurred me to write this and possibly move forward :-O



Thanks


David
