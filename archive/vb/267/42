Subject: front hub grease seal

I'm replacing my old felt/metal grease seal with the
new-type rubber seal and need to know which way to
seat the seal.  Does the cupped side with the metal
spring face towards the inner bearing/race or towards
the spindle?  Also, should that seal sit flush with
the drum?
