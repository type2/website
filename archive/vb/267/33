Uh-Huh. Perhaps you bus got a vin # conversion.
Find the vin # stamped in the body on the flat plate
to the right side of the engine, just in front of the
diagonal edge of the removable rear apron.
You may scrape the old paint to find it.
The third digit in the vin# is the year.
Big silver/red sticker 12 v. lightning bolt-
Did that get scraped off the dash left side?
And he only charged $350 for that ? :)

I must be mis-understanding .. I know my mechanic wouldn't have lied to me.
Are you saying that 67s are 12 volt .. naturally 12 volt ??? Then my
mechanic did not make it 12 volt .. is was already ??? diane
