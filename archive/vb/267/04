Subject: Volkswagon 1958 - 1975

Ever hear of that video ?? Volkswagen 1958 - 1975 .. that is the only label on
it.  I haven't put it in the VCR yet, wondering if it is worth watching .. or
worth wiping the dust off the TV the VCR is attached to in order to watch it.

How do I have this and not know what it is about you ask ?? Well, my mechanic
when he was trying to score points and make me feel secure enough to give him
money, one evening after 5PM when he and all his buddies were sitting around
the shop drinking beer from a cooler out of the back of a pick up truck, he
"loaned it to me." Said it was an interesting video.  I still have it and I
don't think he remembers that I do.
