Subject: oil filter remote mount

I have a CB Performance filter/pump on my SP 1600.  I'm running a stock
exhaust and so I had to "modify" the preheat riser that comes off the
left side of the front of the muffler.  The result of the modification
is that I can use a small (BMW 2002) filter but it is extremely close to
the tube/muffler.  I'd say that they are about .25 inches from each
other.  I'm using piece of aircraft quality asbestos flexible heat
shielding that I wrap around the filter to try and keep the heat
transfer down.

There are no problems as long as the ambient temp stays in the 80's or I
just drive around town.  If the heat rises and I hit the freeway the
temps climb (at 60-65) to the point the Berg temp-a-stick gos off.

The question is:

Does anyone make an adapter that would have outlet/inlet which you
copuld just thread on to the pipe on the filter pump??  I could then
remote mount the filter awayfrom the hot exhaust.  

I know...I should have just full flowed the case, but I did'nt :-(

Thanks.

Steve
