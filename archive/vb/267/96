Subject: used engine installed

I am so stoked! The used engine I paid too much for ($450) is all cleaned up,
tin painted shiny black, dog house and all, and is installed in my 57 DD
panel. I was surprised how quickly things went.

Over the weekend, I found some patience and decided to retorque the heads. I
was surprised how loose they were. I thought maybe the long studs were pulling
out of the case, but after several movements, they finally tightened up. I
then reinstalled the rocker shafts and readjusted the valves and put on the
rocker arm covers.

To install the engine, I had to move the engine from my gravel driveway to the
bus parked on the hill in the street out in front of the house. I tied it to a
small pallet with ropes and just dragged it six inches at a time. It only took
me maybe fifteen minutes. I need to get a dolly! It was a sight and one of my
neighbors saw me.

Once behind the van I tipped it up, pulled the pallet out and rolled my little
cheapie floor jack under. Then just jack it up and roll into the alignment.
The box end ratched wrench is such a great tool. It makes the wrenching pretty
quick and easy. Wires hooked up, gas hooked up, trottle hooked up, confirm
spark present, pour a little gas into carb, and it actually fired then started
right up. OK, only one time around the block to check clutch adjustment and
everything seemed fine. I will finish the rest in the next few days. I will
change oil right away to deal with the cascade of sludge, avoid running more
then 15 minutes to ease it back to life. That stage, you know-installation of
mystery engine, is so exciting! At least the old beast is under its own power
again and it can be among the living.
