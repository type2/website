Is this REALLY a sensible question???
I think not!
Definitely get a grip.
If I talk about my 67 panel, I use the term split
window if the person I'm speaking to doesn't
understand which model this is.
When I talk about my '77 Microbus I don't always refer
to it as a bay.....VW didn't build "splits" in the
70s.
If I talk to anyone outside the bus scene here in Oz I
speak about Kombis, which they presume means
everything from campers to deluxes to microbuses to
panels to DCs & SCs, & then go into specifics from
there.
If we want to get picky, doesn't "vintage" refer to
cars over 50 years old?
Even if it is 40 yrs old that'd make alot of the
"buses" we talk about "veteran".
Should we have a "veteranbus" list???
Of course not.
I think I've made my point.
