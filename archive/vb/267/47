What I am saying is the pedal basically doesn't move at all.  I don't know if
it will even go down an inch.

  The brake pedal should contact the end of the master cylinder with about
  1mm of free play. Then it should have some pressure for the first inch,
  but should not be difficult to move. After the first inch, it should be
  harder to push down, but not difficult at all. Just firm, and the bus
  should be slowing down and stopping at this point. Pedal should not go to
  the floor at all, Should be at least an inch or more up from floor at full
  stopping power.
