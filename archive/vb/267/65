Be happy with your truck and get use to getting passed over! Commercials are 
usually lumped in with everything else. Good luck getting a trophy when your truck is competing against a 23 window barndoor (or even post BD for that matter) for votes, no matter if it is a much better resto. I doubt even David Mayes truck could pull off a win (when finished) which is a real shame. Everyone knows commercials are the coolest *ducks for cover*

 ooooooohhhhhhhh chrome! .....what a bunch of sheep.
