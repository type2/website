Dave, as I am usually the only person in my daily driver I hang one of the
over the window channel hooked cup holders on the passenger window with it
open the width of the hanger. The cab is narrow enough that I can reach over
and get my cup and return it without any trouble.

I am wondering if anyone has designed a cup holder for a 67 or older bus. I
wish I had one in my 57 double door van. How are you all dealing with this
popular accessory?
