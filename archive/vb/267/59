Subject: familienfest, aug 23, new location

srictly vintage 2s has moved san diego's largest vw event, familienfest, to a
new location, just a couple of miiles away from deer park, (the old location).
certain issues with deer park could not be resolved, so we're trying something
else. it is now going to be at the gaujome historic adobe museum park. the new
site INCLUDES friday night camping! no more getting up at "dark thirty",
packing up, moving across the street, to get in line. simply come in friday
night, set up, and enjoy. the date is still saturday prior to pamona, so
travelers can make a weekend of it.  the guajome park is a county facility, as
well as an historic site, self guided tours of the museum are available. we
will have more room, for car haulers, campers, and everyone. trees shade and
grass are included, no hot black top parking lot here. we hope this will be a
positive move, please come out and tell us what you think. for more info you
can contact jay wallace (928)317-2585 jaywsvws(-at-)yahoo.com or john winkley
(760)630-4655. we have directions and more info on our web site.
