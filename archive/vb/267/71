Subject: Deluxe headliner

       OK all you deluxe experts,  We are ready to install the headliner in 
the Jerome raffle bus this weekend.  It is a 1967 13-window.  When we stripped 
the old headliner out, a bunch of 1 inch sponge foam came out as well.  Is 
this something we need to replace??  Or is it somthing that a PO added for 
"improvement"?  
       I don't know where the new headliner came from and haven't seen it 
yet, but for the $180 that it cost the club, I am assuming it should be fairly 
complete.  We have the bows and some small hardware items that were installed 
when we dissassembled it.  I guess my other question, besides the foam thing, 
is:  Is there anyother materials we need to have on hand for this installation?  
I know there is plenty of adhesive needed.  What type?  Spray?  Contact?  I 
suppose we also need to install the windshields and fixed side windows once the 
headliner is installed (?).  All suggestions and advice are very welcomed.

Thanks,

Jon Stanton
