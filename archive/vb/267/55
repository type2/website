I believe this link will help a lot Diane:
http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5867part/611.png

it's a collection of great information on the web of all the parts, if
you are looking for something else start at the page listing here:
http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5867part.html#f9

you can get the part numbers from these pages, then your search will
be much easier.
