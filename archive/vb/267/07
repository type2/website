  My email starts with:  Bruce, Making a list and mental note of a few 
finishing
 touches that I would like to take care.  I believe these should be covered
 under warranty same as the engine case..

 His reply starts with:  i informed your friend that when i got a short block 
 built-up we would schedule you in as agreed, and i would need the bus for a 
couple (2) of days.
 
 But he ends it with:  until you talk to me in person and we discuss what you
 would like to do, and schedule it in on a "NO-RUSH" time frame, i can not 
drop
 what i am doing and do your bus when you dropit off at YOUR convenience...i
 have other customers that really do "schedule" their jobs....
 ............................
why can't he schedule your repairs?   BTW, it doesn't take me 2 days to pull 
and motor, swap stuff to a new long block, and install motor.  but they may do 
that jsut in case.   It is normal to schedule repairs.  Why shouldn't yours 
be scheduled?  You pay bills, this is a warramty fix job and should be 
scheduled in asap.

 I said: The clutch still needs one final [I hope] adjustment. Have to try TOO
 HARD to shift without grinding the gears. I think it is just an adjustment.
 
                    He emailed back: the older busses grind gears when
 shifting, that also may be improper procedure on your part...
 ...................
while old trannies can go bad, it is not true that all older buses grind.   
One way of keeping the tranny from going bad is having a good clutch.   I can't 
tell from here what's happening.   Read your Idiot book.  really.   read 
about adjusting the clutch.  there should be 1/2 inch to one inch free play at the 
pedal, that is before the arm on the tranny starts moving, just enough so the 
clutch isn't on all the time.  You can check this with a friend.  Do check 
this.   Another thing is keep gear oil in teh tranny.

 I said: Brett [must have been him] pulled the horn off. The button broke and
 was hanging there by the wire, but he [or you or Bian] pulled it out. I don't
 want to have to pay someone to wire it back, so would you please have him
 [whoever HIM is] re-run that wire again? I am looking on eBay and in parts
 places for the button and the horn .. I like to use the horn, AND OFTEN ..
 
                     He emailed back: . the horn was not working, center 
button
 was broken and horn would not stay where it was supposed to. I un-plugged it
 to prevent it from tangeling up in the steering wheel.
.......................................................
did the horn work before?  if not, well, you can pay him to fix it. or do it 
yourself.

Is the horn button missing now?   Are the ends of the wire freshly 
cut/broken, or old?  I had teh impression you had a button with wires attached tp it.  
The wires could not get tangled up in the column, or cause any problems.  Is 
the button broken?  We havn't enough info to know what's up here.

 I said: When you installed the gas tank, was there a float or whatever it is
 that makes the gas gauge function ?? I don't want to try and hook up the
 wiring to the gas gauge, only to find there is not a whatever it is .. that
 tells the gauge how much gas there is .. is it called a sending unit or
 something like that ?? Being the tank is where it is, I figured to find this
 out while the engine is out .. know what I mean ???
 
                 He emailed back: . sending unit is in tank, wether it works 
or
 not is agood guess..you seem to forget that we do only limited electrical ,
 get a good electrician that is familiar with vw's. (perhaps , scooter).
....................................................................
did you guage work?   Sounds like he just doesn't want to do electrics on the 
old bus, take it to the other guy.  But yes when the engine out and tank is 
out so when to install a new sender unit if yours is dead.   Read the Bentley 
on how.

 I said: The brakes are just a tiny bit too hard .. I read that on long drives
 that can cause a problem. I don't think that Steve knows how to adjust them 
..
 or I would just have him do it this weekend. I will ask him though .. same 
for
 the clutch.
 
             He emailed back: brakes are SUPPOSED to be hard , thats what 
makes
 them work, you mash em, they grab drums, bus stops.
 ...................................
Hard brakes are good.  When you stomp on brakes, bus should come to 
screeching halt, stuff fly forward, warn passengers first so they don't hit head on 
windsheild breaking glass.  this is no discs, just drums.
