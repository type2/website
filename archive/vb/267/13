O.k., this my last contribution to this thread.
A number of arguments seem to based on actual
production titles 
VW NEVER made 'split window' bugs, which most of the
protagonists in this debate seem to have used as basis
for not using the term for buses.
And on this point I've heard more people describe this
model of 'bug' as a 'split-oval'.
In fact we should actually call these early models
just Sedans & refer to the later ones by other names,
using the logic that says pre-67 Type2s should just be
called Buses, needing no reference to their
appearance.
In addition, they did not even refer to the cars as
Beetles or Bugs, even issuing a factory mandate to
stop dealers using this nickname.
The only 'bug' VW ever made was the SuperBug & if
we're getting picky about vintage they're also getting
old.
Further more, the buses after 1967 were called Mk2s by
VW, not 'bays', it was again an enthusiast designation
to prevent confusion.
So if we live in a world where post-67 vehicles don't
exist feel free to describe early Type1s featuring the
distinctive double rear window as 'split windows' &
call Type2s buses.......except for the delivery vans &
dual & single cab pickups.
Now wait a moment, perhaps I should've used the German
names??
Uh, oh, I forgot to take the little pink pills that my
therapist prescribed for my obsessive problem.......

:o)
Cheers & God Bless
