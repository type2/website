  OK .. I need the pivots I guess.  I have the arms, yes .. the part the blade
connects to.

  The motor just dangles, or did, until I laid it on the shelf .. there is
nothing to hold the motor, wherever it goes .. and for sure these flat pieces
are 2 different sizes .. But I will look once more ...

  Seems I bought what they call "wiper linkage" 211955325A left   211955326A
right [at Wolfsburg]

  So I have motor [but does it work ?? who knows]  linkage and arms.  NOTHING
ELSE.  I don't see any other parts available at Wolfsburg.

    Wiper pivots are the things that stick through the body of the bus.  On a
67
    you have to remove the wiper motor/frame, and undo the tiny circlip at the
end
    of the old broken pivot and pull the shaft out of the tube, and revers
ethe
    process for installation into a 67 wiper frame.   the bracket thing is the
    frame, the round cylinderical thing is teh actuall motor.   Look in teh
archives
    and read what I wrote about redoing my wiper motor in my 65 when I got it.
I
    also wrote something more recently about going through the wiper motor  in
my
    67 riviera.
