I had a rocker arm stud strip out one time.  Made the same type of
"clack" like I'd not adjusted the valves correctly and one side was WAY
too loose.  After checking them (the valves) a bunch of times I took the
rocker assembly off only to find that upon reinstallation, one of the
studs would not tighten down.  The threads were stripped and so the
shaft was "slapping" against the boss every time that cylinder's valves
were being opened/closed.  JB welded the threads and it solved the
problem. 

Just a thought.
