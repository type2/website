Gee... and here I thought the behavior that 
downgraded the list was people who post questions 
that are easily answered by doing a little research 
intsead of asking stupid questions, then acting 
like they cannot wait over 6 hrs for an answer...

There are no stupid questions, only stupid people.

The answer to your question can be found on a 
hundred web sites, with the easiest being in the 
type2.com library under "engine letter codes".

Since you are probably too lazy to find that, the 
url is http://type2.com/bartnik/enginecodes.htm
