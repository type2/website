Subject: Full Moon Bus Club campout Nov 30, Dec 1&2,

forwarded for a friend in regards to a Full Moon Bus Club Campout the last
weekend in Nov.  (Nov 30 & Dec 1-2, 2001)

Please feel free to post to other VW bus or Van lists.

Yes! The campout is still on. We are not that great with making the final
planning, we were tossed between three different locations, yet have finally
selected one. If you could please post the following.

North Florida
Full Moon
Stephen Foster Folk Culture
Center State Park

This link will give you the information on the Park,
following the "Camping Information" icon will give you the camping details.

                Price:               $12.00 per night
                Electricity:        $ 3.00 per night
                Extra Vehicle:  $ 2.00
                Pets:                 $ 2.00

                Reservations are accepted, yet as of November 1st all 45
sites were available. Please E-mail me if you are interested in attending. I
will be making a list of all those who are planning on coming, and if you
are interested in doubling up (sharing a site) please let me know so that I
can pair people. Making reservations to attend is the responsibility of
those that are attending, yet if you want to share a site, e-mail me first.
The number for information/reservations is (386)-397-4331.  I must apologize
for the length of time it took posting the location, there were three
possibilities, and as for proximity sake we went with the central most
location. Hope to see you all in the light of the Full Moon.
