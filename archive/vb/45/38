Subject: sunroof parts for 65 deluxe

me too, me too! I also need that short 5"track piece for the sunroof.  I
need it for both sides plus the "tack strip" that screws into the roof
and anchors the sunroof in the rear. I think the two short 5" tracks
could be cut from one long piece with a band saw if somebody happens to
have an extra long piece or a damaged one. ( they do have the same
profile, right? ) Also if someone has dimensions for the rear "tack
strip"( or whatever that part's called ) could you please e-mail me,
maybe I can make that piece. TIA for any help or leads, 
Thanks, Chris
