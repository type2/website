Get a long piece of angle iron, drill to match two of the lug nut holes,
bolt on, and work against the ground while loosening the nut.  Remember,
righty tighty lefty loosey!  :)

or, remove the axle from the tranny and take the thing to someone with a
big impact wrench.  The drum won't mind the impact, but the tranny'll hate
it.
