Hi Hart,

This probably won't make it to the list, I get bounced by the new spam
filters.

Just pick up one of those aluminum 4 to 5 bolt adaptors at a swap meet. They
work dandy, just bolt it to your wheel and they can use their cones in the
center hole. Shouldn't cost but a few bucks, and you only need one. If you
buy a  pair you can sell one to a buddy.
