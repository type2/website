This is all you need to know: The setscrews dont touch the flat part of the
bar they touch the *opposite* side of the bar.
The flat spot actually mates with the bracket piece on the flap which has a
flat spot as well. I can post a pic if that doesnt make sense. Will have a
write up shortly on my site since im in the process of doing one now on my
57
