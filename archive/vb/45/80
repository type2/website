Subject: Re: [VB] front end rebuild Q's

Hi Mike,
Depends on what you are trying to do with your bus.  A complete original 
resto then you need to rebuild the front end you have and weld new suspension 
snubbers back on it for leaf spring safety.  If you are mainly interested in 
driving it and having the best VW built, a 1966-67 front suspension is better 
due to the two needle bearings per trailing arm instead of the one needle 
bearing and 1955-64ish earlier bushing.  The needle bearings are much better 
longer lasting!  Plus the 1966-67 suspensions have the stocker anti-sway bar 
which helps alot to keep you from shifting from lane to lane in side 
winds/semi passing you when you are trying to keep straight in just one lane.
Come out for our Spring meet at Puyallup 28APR02, there should be tons of 
good VW stuff as usual.
