This is going to sound really stupid, but I have more than once put the hoses
on the fuel pump backwards!  The pump is trying to pull gas from the carb and
push it to the tank.  Don't work too well huh?  Anyway I usually figure it out
after a bunch of cus'n and a bid doh!

Check it out before you go pulling the pump or buying a new battery.
