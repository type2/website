Subject: Case Bore Size?


A couple of questions:

1.) On a pre-1965 engine case with a "B" coded engine that was originally a 
1500cc, what was the original case bore size on the number 1 bearing?  Our 
case is measuring 2.5745".... comments?

2.) Can you use the 1600cc cylinder bores in a 1500 case without machining?
