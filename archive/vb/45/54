Subject: More BD Westy hitch

Thanks to all who replied.  I am trying to get
pictures of the BD unit right now.  I should have them
this weekend.  What i have been told is that it has a
Westy tag of some sort that is marked 1951.  It is
made from round tube's instead of square.  It came off
a 1954 bus.   I will try and post the pictures to
either Vintagebus or VW Planet when they come.

Thanks
Matthew
