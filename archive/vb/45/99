Bentley lists the following main and air correction jet sizes for
various 28 PICT, 28 PICT-1, and 30 PICT-1 carburetors:

main  air   difference
117.5 135z  17.5
115   135z  20
122.5 145y  22.5
115   145y  30
115   150z  35

For more numbers, see http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/wog69/045.png .
It looks like only the early 36 hp engines with the 28 PCI have large
differences between the main jet and air correction jet numbers.
