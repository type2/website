Subject: On Balance

Greetings Honorable Bus List Members:

Unbelievable! No tire shop in town has the "spider" adopter to balance the
tires on my 1967 21DLX! I get the same story, need the adopter to balance!
Is this a part that can be purchased? Or am I SOL? Any comments,
observations, or cuss words will be appreciated.

Cordially,

Hart H. Ponder, Jr.
