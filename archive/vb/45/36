A Binz is a coachbuilt doublecab.  In the early days of production, VW
only built singlecabs, then farmed them out to the Binz company to be
converted to doublecabs.  Binzes are the Holy Grail of VW buses.

If you look very closely at the letterbox version, you can see a binz
parked outside Castle Anthrax  :)
