Subject: Early Bus Sunroof Parts

Anyone searching for early bus sunroof parts that are not presently in use 
has quite a journey ahead of them.  I have done a pretty good scouring of 
the VW junkyards and famous to infamous retailers and hobbyists, and found 
nothing.  One place that does have a few bits lying about is Koch's in Santa 
Clarita, CA.  Their number is 661-252-9264, ask for Reuben.  I was looking 
for the small piece of slider track behind the main piece (I don't have it 
in me to cut up a big piece - - it would be like burning a book!), and they 
had a part matching my description.  No one there knew for sure what it was 
off of, but the dimensions and description matched, so I told them to box it 
up and send it to me.  They said they had a large piece or two of track, as 
well.

Good luck

(and if the part arrives and it is NOT what we thought it was, I will be 
back on the search again!)
