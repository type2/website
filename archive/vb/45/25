Subject: Barn Door Westy Tow Hitch

Has anyone ever seen a Barn Door Westy Tow hitch For
sale?  I have the opertunity to buy one along with
some post BD hitch's but do not know what they go for.
 I have no need for the BD one so i will be re-selling
it anyway.  The guy wants me to make an offer.  Anyone
out there interested in one or know what they should
sell for?  I would think they would sell for more then
the post BD ones. 

This one is dated 1951.

It also looks like i will have a Type 2 Peka hitch FS
also.  It is dated 1965.  This one is very similar to
a Westy hitch.

Thanks
Matthew
