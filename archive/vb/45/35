Woah!  I hope you mean "generator" and not "alternator".  Attempts to
polarize an _alternator_ will damage it!

If it's a generator, you're probably hearing the new commutator segments.
Keep an eye on the brushes to make sure that the commutator isn't wearing
them out fast.

Get the alternator fixed first.  I've never seen any need to switch to
electronic ignition, but some swear by it (and others at it).
