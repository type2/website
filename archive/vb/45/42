Subject: sundial interior

every pic I've seen of sundial interiors have had a leatherette or vynal
camp cushions. our new to us 66 sundial has a heavy almost saddle blanket
type covering which I would normally assume to have been added later except
that its done too professionally and also covers a little bit of the wall in
the rear and also the front seats. has anyone run across this before? should
all sundials be vynal?
thanks all
