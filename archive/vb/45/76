Hart,

Wouldn't it be possible to take an extra front drum,
balance it, and use it as the adapter?  I've wondered
this for some time, as I think they can use some of
their small cones to center on the bearing races.  My
local tire dealer said he's willing to give it a try,
but I've never gotten around to it.
