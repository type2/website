I'll keep my eyes peeled. I seem to see lots of split buses when I'm in
my GTI and none while in my Panel, so shouldn't have much trouble
running across it...

Hi all,

Just had someone send me an email about a stolen Crew Cab in Orange
County.
It's got a camoflauge paint scheme and safari's, so it shouldn't be THAT
hard to spot.

Photos and details here:

Thanks,
