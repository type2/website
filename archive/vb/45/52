Subject: Houston we have liftoff! But not all good

Well, volks!
Got the fuel pump solved, seems the aftermarket gold can Brazilian ones have
the input up top, output down below, why it's different from german ones I
have seen, don't know.
Engine ran, like crap. I abandoned trying to break her in, ran rich or
richer, not what I hoped. The carb leaked at the accelerator pump rod area,
scary thought. So much elese is new, i am going to replace the carb anyway,
as big screw wouldn't even change idle above 800 rpm, never leaned out.
I must go throught the valves ones more too, she was why too noisy, you'd
think a 1700.00 engine never run would have well adjusted valves form the
builder?> No? Pays to triple check outher poeple's work, double check yours.
Timed at 7.5 BTDC statically, wil get dynamically timed when she runs right.
All in all aprehensive about the engine, but I think it wil work out in the
end.
Must redo the gaskets on the bearing caps, getting some trans oil seepage
out there, not kewl. Might go to silicone here? I use permatex gasket
adhesive. Think I need at least aviation permatex here.
Almost there...
