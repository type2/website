That seems to be a German or Euro thing.  I have seen a few pictures
of old European Buses with trailer hitches, and they usually always have
that style - the neck comes up from under the bumper and has a ball on
the end of it, and it's apparently seamless.  When I was in Germany a
couple of years ago I saw similar hitches on late-model cars - I don't
think I saw any "American style" hitches where the ball bolts through
a flat bar.

It might be a TueV thing - if the ball and hitch are one piece,
it's harder to fit a bigger ball and tow something that's too
big for your engine or brakes.  Not impossible, but harder.
I don't know for sure, though.
