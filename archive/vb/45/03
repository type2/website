Subject: Re: [VB] Stolen Crew Cab - Orange County CA.

I've been in contact with Randy.  He lives in N. Orange County CA.  Beach and
Artesia if you know the area.  Keep your eyes peeled...even if you're out of
state as the camo paint is very recognizable.  It has/had safari's too.  Stock
height.  At any up coming shows people should be aware that is could pop up
with new primer too.

I've got a DC and am in the N. OC area, so I'm a bit sympathetic to Randy''''s
plight.
