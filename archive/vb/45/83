Hi Hart,
You can just have them gravity balance them.  Since we have invested in 
powdercoated rims we just have them install the wieghts on the innerside of 
the rim for better looks and no scratches on the outer visible side.  
Probably because we only drive up to 70 MPH tops (Coasting downhill.) this 
seems to work so far for us.  Eric&Barb
