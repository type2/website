I'd expect the tin to have a 1/16 gap at the case but otherwise to be OK.
There should be enough tolerance built into the attachments to the front
and rear tins to absorb 1/16 inch per side.  The ends of the fan shroud
might have a small gap as well, but the tin is flexible there.

Still, you're the man on the spot, so look carefully for other alignment
problems that might exist.  I spend quite a bit of time on tin, and often
loosen and twiddle bits of it to get it all happily in place.
