Subject: Re: [VB] sundial interior

Chuck,
   I've not seen an original with anything but the vinyl.  What year is 
yours?  Is yours a Kombi or panel, does it have the logo?  Have any pics?  
Post them on http://www.sundial-camper.com

you said it matches the front seats.  It is probably an after market job, 
Sundial usually left them salt and pepper.  Someone correct me please if I 
am wrong.
