Subject: Re: [VB] "The Great Bus Tour" and Hubcap... Also Bulli 7

Hiya Folks . Yea "The Great Bus Tour" and Hubcap  are  currently in Archdale
NC, any one wanting to carry it from here contact me p-mail. I haven't hada
chance to look at it much but will later today. Any suggestions on which
area it needs to head next ????
 I also want to thank Kris, Mark , and the rest of the group for the
hospitality on friday nite,(good grub too). I would also comment that Bulli
Brigade 7 was one of the best shows i have attended. Hopefully next year i
can attend again, but this time the Binz might look a bit better and
hopefully next time it won't be such a whirl wind trip. I'll post a trip
report later i'm still recouping from 1605 miles to fla and back ,,later
