Subject: Re: [VB] Stolen Crew Cab - Orange County CA.


I would add one of those steering wheel locking bars... hmmm, named ???, 
memory is the second thing to go :-(.  Even a shift locked car can be rolled 
around the corner to a carrier so you need to cover the alternatives.  FYI, 
I have found that the shift lock housing tends to move a little over time 
with use regardless of what I have tried to keep it in place and will need 
adjustment from time to time depending on how much you drive... second gets 
difficult on mine.  The maintenance only takes a few minutes to correct and 
does not affect my high opinion of them.  A simple maintenance item compared 
to some others I know.

Course, you could try something really creative with hardened chain to keep 
the car from rolling in any way shape or form that my son and I have 
discussed from time to time... then he becomes critical of my paranoia but I 
love my VWs and would be cut to the core if something happened to them that 
I might have been able to discourage.  I hope he takes security a little 
more seriously someday.

Hey... speaking of which.  The police use a wheel block/locking  mechanism 
for vehicles parking illegally and waiting to be towed.... can those be 
purchased (at a ridiculous price probably)?  Seems that would be a pretty 
intense security device :-) .. and I am not entirely joking.

A friend of mine here who is a "cop" comments that if they really want the 
car they will probably get it... the trick is to make them have to invest 
more time than is safe to get the car moved.
