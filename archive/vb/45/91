And even a car with the wheels locked up or a "boot" around a wheel
can be dragged up onto a flat-bed with a sufficiently stout winch.
If they want it that bad, they won't mind a little flat spot on the
tires.

A friend of mine with a '65 found that poor maintenance is a good
anti-theft measure.  He had some guys out to do work on his house
and he thinks they just came back later.  Whoever it was grabbed his
TV, VCR, microwave, etc, loaded them into his '65, and took off.
Now, this Bus was missing the spring at the bottom of the gear
shift and had a slightly tempermental trans.  The accelerator cable
has included a piece of baling wire as long as I can remember.
My friend wasn't kidding when he said that he was the only person
that could drive his Bus.  They found the Bus about a mile away -
apparently it had stalled out and they couldn't get it restarted.
They took the electronic loot with them but the Bus was otherwise
undamaged.  He started it up and drove it home...
