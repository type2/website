 For those interested, i posted the pictures of the
 1951 and the 1965 Westfalia Tow Hitches on VW Planet. 
 Search "1951 Westfalia Tow Hitch" and "1965 Westfalia
 Tow Hitch" to find them.
 
 The 1951 unit is similar to the 1965 except the curved
 piece behind the ball that fit's into the pressed
 bumper.  The date code is 1951 although i did not get
 a picture of it.
 
 Thanks
 Matthew
