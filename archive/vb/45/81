Hi Scott,
We are real happy with the 3.88R&P and .82 fourth gear with our SP 1641 CW 
engine.  With 205s on all four rims we get 58MPH (-at-) 3,000 RPM and still get 24 
MPG.  Have not tried it at 3,500 RPM with the tach to see where it RPMs at 
yet.

<<Which VW transmissions carried the 3.88? >>

The majority of post-1972 type 1s.   Eric&Barb
