Greasy Volks,

Taking Bernie Bermann's advice, I used a 1750 pound clutch plate for My
Sweet Bus and her 1835 mildly souped.  It is proving waay to strong and
hard to use.  First my son snapped an axle on the paddle end, just
inside the tranny case.  Resulting in a need for a new tranny  (thanks
Ronnie) On Shunday I thought I lost my clutch cable, as it went soft,
but not completely to the floor, just soft.  Son Bry thought it was the
cable or perhaps the throwout bearing.  

Well, you know what it was.  We put in the new cable and same problem,
so we are going back to a stock plate. 

Here's a question.  The little rubber coated metal coil/tube that the
cable runs through just before hooking onto the clutch lever on the
tranny, gave us fits last night.  We had to pull the innard plastic
tubing out to get the clutch cable threaded end through it.  This
worries me as I realize that there is now metal on metal in there,
despite the oodles of grease we put in.  Son Bry says, yeah, in 20 years
it will break.  But I dunno.

Are these generally available?  Where?  About how much?  How do you get
the threaded end of the cable through it?

Best,

Curt
