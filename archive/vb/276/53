Subject: Josh Rogers Memorial campout and Tulsa show.

Here is the information I recieved on the Josh Rogers campout and Tulsa VW
show.  

If you don't know who Josh was, he was a very active bus person who had a
big hand in creating the type II archives.  Josh loved busses and campouts,
thus the memorial campout held every year since his passing.  Josh was the
kind of camper that was ready at the mention of a campout.  When camping,
Josh was the last one to bed, he would go from campfire to campfire until
there was no one left awake to talk to.

Hey All,
I made a decision on the camp out, it will be Sept. 26-28 at Keystone Lake
just West of Tulsa Oklahoma. The Tulsa VW show is the same weekend at the
Tulsa Southern Hills Marriot. I will see if we can reserve an area but I'm
not sure. I think this will be great for a lot of people. Pass it on and
I'll see you then.
