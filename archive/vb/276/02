Sounds like you're talking about the bowden tube. Readily avaliable new from
just about any VW parts place. You can't have the tube in place when fishing
the clutch cable through it, as the long threaded end of the cable will not
manuver through the bend in the tube (you must shim the tube so that it has
1/2" deflection).

You're close to us, and can pick one up today if you wanted.  :-)

Still going on the bus cruise this weekend Curt?
