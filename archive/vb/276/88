Subject: VW camping in KC area this weekend!!

Attention all VW Camping Enthusiast!!!
 
Mo-Kan VW club is organizing its first ever weekend campout/Fall Picnic.
 
Camping: Friday, September 19th through Sunday, September 21st.
 
Mo-Kan Fall Picnic to be held on Sunday, September 21st.
 
Clinton, Kansas...Bloomington Park on Clinton Lake at the Hickory
Campground.
 
Each campsite is $14.00 per night,  a maximum of two units per site is
allowed ( 2 tents or 1 tent and 1 trailer ).  Each site has its own
electrical hook-up and picnic table.  The campground has modern showers and
restrooms as well as a swimming area.
 
To join in the fun, reserve your spot today!  Go to www.reserveusa.com
<http://www.reserveusa.com>  to book a site.  Select camping and Kansas then
go to the Clinton lake area and choose Bloomington park or hickory campsite.
We think sites 160-166 & 192 - 196 are the best choice since they have a
grassy common area and are right next to the walking trail to the swimming
area.
 
Check in Friday night is at 6:00 p.m. and check out Sunday is at 5:00 p.m..
We will be heading a caravan out to the park on Friday night from Don's
Steakhouse parking lot in Lawrence off Hwy 10.  We will be there by 6:15 and
leaving out for the lake at 6:30p.m.  If you can not make this time call
Mike at 785-843-5981 for detailed directions.
