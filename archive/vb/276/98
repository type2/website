TOTALLY!
A point those people who claim to know so much about
their pets & for that matter ALL dogs miss all the
time.
How differently does your dog act when you have
visitors over?
Generally quite a bit, depending on the person.
Now imagine you have about 200 or 300 visitors over
for a party....AND they all bring their buses.
Total over stimulation and disorientation since a
dog's hearing & smell is far more acute than our own &
of course they're mostly at knee height.
If it was happening at your place you'd probably leave
the dog at a friend's place or put it into a kennel
for the day.
Add to that the fact that your dog may've travelled
for a couple of hours in your bus to get there & is
now stir crazy.

It's sad, but it's the dummies that ruin it for
everyone.
Oh, for better owners.
Maybe you should start a new club, Sean.
Good Busses & Good Dogs.
That way you can filter you membership & avoid the bad
ones.
And on that note, I think I'll don my flame-proof
suit.........

Cheers & God Bless
