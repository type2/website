As having been bitten by a dog in a similar circumstance and then not being 
able to find the dog afterwards, I had to undergo the series of rabies 
shots.  Not fun at all, one shot a day in my stomach for two weeks.  The 
dog bit into my stomach and broke skin through my clothes.  It happened so 
quick, I really didn't realize what happened until all the blood.  All I 
remember is walking up a ramp from one level at school to the next, with 
everyone else and all of a sudden seeing a dog coming down the ramp with a 
panicked look in its eyes.  Next thing, I know, I'm on the ground with 
blood all over the place and the dog running away as fast as it could.  I 
didn't reach out to it, provoke it or anything.  It just wanted by and I 
happened to be in the way.

Even the best Bus Hound can be spooked to the point of biting.

Now, reread that above and think how you would feel if your dog did that to 
one of your fellow campers or worse yet, one of the kids.
