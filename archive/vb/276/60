Subject: Sharing my good news

Finally .. finally .. found the wiper assembly and shafts for my bus.  FINALLY
some good
news.  Rainex works GREAT .. but still .. there are times when you want to
brush some
ugly spider that is crawling up your glass off .. and you can't pull the bus
over to do so before
he finds one of the holes from the missing shaft .. know what I mean ??

ALSO . .ordered and received a pint of that Rust Bullet.  Thought I would give
it a try on my
dash.  Rolled it on yesterday.  Dries real nice.  Leaves what looks like a
bare metal finish, silver,
finish. [not chrome, just more silver than grey primer.]

If the Internet was a real super-highway it would
be traveled by slow moving garbage trucks with
big flashing corporate logos on them, little kids
riding tricycles carrying supersoakers filled with
battery acid, and HUGE yellow schoolbuses with
America Online painted on them, filled with kids
throwing stuff out of the windows.
