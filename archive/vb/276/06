Subject: need to know

I have a problem with the 1600 dp engine on a 67 splitty, it is not the
original engine. At a speed of 45 mph the engine experienced a loud backfire,
when I pulled to the side the engine continued to run.  Being in a dangerous
spot on the shoulder of a highway, I had to keep it running on three cylinders
hoping no further harm would come. When I got to a place where I could look I
found the #1 sparkplug totally missing and compression poofing out that
position.  Shutting off the engine and trying to install a spare plug I found
the threads stripped. What I need to know is WHAT HAPPENED? HOW TO REPAIR IT?
CAN I DO IT MYSELF? I have very rudimentary skills when it comes to mechanics,
but I am willing to try, I have a repair manual but haven't found this exact
problem described. I am going to attempt removing the engine this morning and
see what comes next? Any help will be appreciated and needed! thanks.
