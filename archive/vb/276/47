Wha-? You have to take more than that?  Dude, I always thought some 
stash, a bag of doritos, and an old blanket was all U needed for 
camping.  OK, maybe not the doritos or the blanket.

Seriously, I can relate to the Donner Party Camping Plan.  I smugly 
convert necessity to virtue whenever I look at my comrades with 
young'uns and chuckle that mine are 16 and 21 now, but I remember the 
day - case of Huggies, toys out the wazoo, formula, dipey-wipes, 
gerber's, and spanish-inquisition Infant Restraining Devices till there 
was no room for the doritos *or* the stash.  Shizzay, stay home and 
watch PeeWee Herman instead.

The Almaden campouts will return one day, ol' Dad, fear ye not.

I remember road-tripping to Crescent Beach FL from Gainesville in about 
'76, driving up and down the beach all afternoon in my MGB (you could 
drive on the beach for miles), and sleeping in Anastasia State Park 
campground under an old army tarp that night -- I *think* we had a 
groundcloth -- shivering with sunburn and burping fritos all night.

Now there's a merit badge worth wearing: Camping with as Little Advance 
Preparation as Possible.  OTOH, from my one time at Jerome I don't 
think I would do that there, but feh, I'm old now.

Y'all have fun this year.  I hope to make it back one day.
