Patience, my friend.  Spray the blaster, tap it with a hammer (lightly!) 
Don't beat on it...you just want to set up a little vibration to jiggle the 
blaster into the joint.  Go off and do something else for thirty minutes or 
an hour.  Then repeat the process.  Two or three times.  Then give it a 
good blast, and forget about it until tomorrow.

The next morning, give it a good blast and tap...wait a few minutes and fry 
to pry/jiggle/vibrate it loose.

You could heat it with a torch, but you would probably set your bus afire. 
- not a good thing.  Maybe one of those halogen work lights that are so 
hot, but maybe not.


Or, you could take out the bolt holding the square rubber pads and pull the 
tranny with the coupling attached...........
