Hi Bart,
OK, if your passenger (LHD) tie rod is original it does not adjust and does 
not have a way to replace tie rod ends due to the rod being swedged onto the 
tie rod ends.  Slide back under your bus and take a look at the driver side tie 
rod.  Where the tie rod ends are threaded into the rod there are a locking 
clamp much like a water hose clamp at both ends.  You can view these parts in:
