Here's another ?, Is the outer tie rod end passenger side left or right
threaded?  Which way should I turn it.  I think these are the original ones
from the factory...

TIA.
you either turn it clockwise or counterclockwise.

I just set the toe in yesterday on a bus that had a NEW adjustable tie rod.  
It has a nice square area in the middle for something to hold or turn the 
center, and had lock nuts at each end where the ends go on. So i undid the 
locknuts and the center turned.   looking at the threads I figured out which way each 
one turned, and it also told me which way to twist the center piece to reduce 
the toe in.  I like that nice square section.   nice addition.
