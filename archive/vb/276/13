Subject: Re: [VB] plug blew out/need to know

you can get a insert to put in there.  however, I'd do a compression test on 
the other three.  and check the end play.   You may decide it'd time to do a 
rebuild.  I mean, I have heard you can do an insert with the engine installed, 

But personally I'd pull the motor and pull the head off.  and new heads 
aren't too pricey, so why repair an old one?   and if you are  at that point, if 
the other head is worn, make it symmetrical.   so check rings, rod bearings too. 
   Hope this helps.  Read your idiot book on pulling motor and heads and 
checking for wear, but ask back on the list if you have more questions.

I had a spark plug come out with messing up the head threads on the motor 
that is now in my 61.   Couldn't put one back in.  So I decided it was time to 
switch to SP.   every thing checked out w/ little wear, so new rod bearings and 
rebuildt heads and put it back together and it's been good.

found the #1 sparkplug totally missing and compression poofing out that
position.  Shutting off the engine and trying to install a spare plug I found
the threads stripped. What I need to know is WHAT HAPPENED? HOW TO REPAIR IT?
CAN I DO IT MYSELF?
