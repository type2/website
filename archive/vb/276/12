Ya, the silver white isn't very silver at at.   more greyey beigey.  bleaches 
lighter in the sun/age  though, if you have an old wheel w/ original paint 
and polish it you see.  I was surprised when I got my 65's wheel powder coated 
the lady there told me she had the exact colour I wanted, though the paint chip 
was darker that I thought, it perfectly matched a *polished up* piece of a OG 
paint rim

I have rattle canned bumpers cheap white, wheels ditto.  but if I was making 
it nice I'd get a better match.

I don't believe that the inside of the bumper was originally painted white.

yes, the old OG paint under the later paint on my 61 does look somewhat 
bluish.   splash pans black.

I have determined through research of the archives that my '66 Deluxe's
bumpers should be painted L82, Silver White.  My question is this, I bought
a can of L82 from WW just to see the color, it appears to be a much'darker'
white than the L680 Cummulus White of the top portion and interior of my
Bus.  Were all Bus bumpers painted L82?  And do most folks go with the L82
or with the white of the Bus?  Mostly just curious.
