Well, I'll weigh in here and attract the ire of the pet folk away from
you. I've gone to many outdoor events and find that pets are more trouble
than they are worth. Pets that are normally well behaved can change in
strange surroundings, particularly surroundings as strange as a bus
gathering.
 
 
I agree to a point, but there are people who fit the above comment as well. As a responsible dog "owner" I too am irritated by dogs running freely at events. But what is often not remembered is that most problems are directly related to the owners and not the dogs themselves. Some breeds are more aggressive by nature and a bad owner can bring that out by not raising the animal properly. I have two dogs, a mix and an English Setter that I left at home this year. They are a little too young to travel, but the real reason was because of all the other bad dogs and owners that always tend be present at campouts.
