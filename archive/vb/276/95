I think I didn't want to spend money on a rat truck before it runs.
Did you see them, David?  They had original felts.  <snip>


WOW... I saw them but didn't turn them over to inspect.  I did notice
they were $40.  I have the covers already for the double cab and I guess
since I saw they were a little crusty on the bottom edge, I didn't
really pay attention.  I really didn't pay that much attention at the
swaps.  The mind was kinda in neutral and I ended up spending more time
with the v80 and talking with people than at the swaps (a new concept
for me :-O  )

So, anybody know who that was with the divider panels at the swaps at
Yakima????  Then again, I guess I should go out to the garage and see if
the current felt stash is enough to finish things up.... again, all the
time has been spent getting the v80 fully functional as I knew I wanted
to make the Yakima show and to accomplish a few favors I owe friends
using the truck.  BTW, thanks for a few list members that have sent me
felts so far.


Also, I have a trip report posted up on my web site but I'm waiting for
a few pictures from my friends camera that show me out on the drag strip
with the v80 before I advertise it publicly...
