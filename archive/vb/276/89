Yeah, with that selection the aftermarket guys don't have anything to 
worry about for a while.  They seem to be associated with the museum 
more than VW, but it's hard to say.  Interesting.

The "Technik/Technical" parts catalogs are fun to browse, but there's a 
bug that causes right-column links to appear in the left column instead 
of center, which is annoying.  I wrote them about it.  At least that's 
what happens on this machine.
