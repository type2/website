Subject: NOS Barndoor wiper blades found.........

I found about 50 sets NOS Barndoor wiper blade this weekend. They have the arms, but no bases.
They are original SWF and still have soft and workable rubber on them.

My question, since I'm not a BARNDOOR guy is, what can these be SOLD for that is reasonable to both parties?
The reason I say SOLD, is I know I could price them at $XXXX.XX and sit on them forever, but that's not my style.

Thanks,
Greg
