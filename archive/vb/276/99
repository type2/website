Subject: Monza to stock exhaust on a 1776.

Can I ditch a 4 tip monza for a stock bus exhaust on a 39mm valved 1776
running a 34 pict? I have backfire on decelleration currently, but only if
throttle is really snapped shut quickly, and idle is poor, starting is hard.
I'm thinking exhuast leak, plus the thing is damn loud.
