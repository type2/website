During my resto, we had to replace lower front side door hinge plate. The
welder guy in the shop made some small cuts, pulled out the bad plate, we
put a replacement in, and he welded and ground out the beads so fast - the
whole thing was beyond my ability to even come up with a solution, and he
had the job done so fast, my head was spinning!
