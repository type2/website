In my last post I wrote:

"Common sense. Accountability for self in general and leave the dogs with Mom
or
at a kennel. Your rabid "bad assed" penile compensating Pit bulls and Rotties
do not mix well with strangers and other peoples' kids.
Leave the drugs at home or duh- perhaps don't do them and save your brain for
the years in which you will need it.
Drive safely, remember that it is *SUPPOSED* to be a family oriented club with
a desire to raise money for one or more charitible causes."

OK fine, I expressed my opinion and THEN talked to my little Mrs.
She wanted/wants to take the three dogs. *THREE?* especially after I just
upbraided the list emasse for choice of pets, what they represent and the
audacity for bringing them to a public event. Bringing three dogs, two kids
under age 4, packing for a campout that will, for us, last less than 23 hours
and arriving late... camping away from the event.

Drugs? naw, but I could certainly make many quick jokes about my situation.
To me, "family" camping events are becoming less and less attactive when it
entails packing for passage of the entire Donner Party across the Rockies
rather than just grabbing a loaf of bread, a jug of Almadene, a couple of
sleeping bags and shoving the keys into the rat bus and hauling AZ.
