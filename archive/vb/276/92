Subject: Re: [VB] The espresso bus has returned - pics

As of yet, Spokane, WA has yet to try to enact a stupid tax like what Seattle
is proposing.  I think All of us espresso bar owners would go burn city hall.
As to the logos, they are vinyl.  I did not have the bread to spring for hand
painting.  Perhaps someday....

  Tom,
      So will you be charging the espresso tax next show?  Also is that logo
vinyl or paint?
