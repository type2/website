Subject: Re: [VB] Stuck Tie rod end

...
OK, how do you get a tie rod end out.  I removed the entire right or
passenger
rod and both ends from the bus, but I can't get either end to budge.  I've
been using wd40 and am now trying heat.  When I clamp it down in the vise and
turn the end the rod wants to twist....  Any ideas?  For a '66
...

Here's another ?, Is the outer tie rod end passenger side left or right
threaded?  Which way should I turn it.  I think these are the original ones
from the factory...

TIA.
