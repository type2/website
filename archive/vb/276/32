Subject: Water tight Microbus ?

A direct quote from my Science and Mechanics 1959 Annual Car Repair Handbook -
Road Test on the Volkswagen Microbus Deluxe.

Quote - "Water penetration tests showed the MIcrobus to be watertight under
medium to heavy rainstorms, a record only a few cars we have tested can
match"

Obvious question - And which cars were worse?..... or are we missing something
in our knowledge base?
