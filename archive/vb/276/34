Subject: Stuck Tie rod end

OK, how do you get a tie rod end out.  I removed the entire right or passenger
rod and both ends from the bus, but I can't get either end to budge.  I've
been using wd40 and am now trying heat.  When I clamp it down in the vise and
turn the end the rod wants to twist....  Any ideas?  For a '66

Thanks,
   Bart
