Amen brudda, amen.

John Moore sez :nein, nein!" to 1750 pound clutch plates. 

I lost a paddle end of my driverside axle to a d*mned 1570 plate, thus
a tranny 'cause the shards fell into the tranny bearing, then like you,
a throwout bearing "wishbone."  PITA.  I just replaced it this weekned,
and we HAPPENED to have a beater ''78 home made camper that was given to
us sitting out in front of the house,so we pulled that engine for parts
to go on our '72 Westy project, and I pulled the gas tank and put it in
while the engine was out of My Sweet Bus.  

Missed the Salt Lake Group's cruise up into the Manti-La Sals.  HOW WAS
THE TRIP, ERIC?  I know this, it was cold up there because Saturday
night/Shunday morning we got a mild frost here in Provo.
