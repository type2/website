Jim,

Having done this repair and the tight confines involved..... the probability
of finding the plate AND threading it back thru it's holder AND getting the
first bolt thru are pretty slim. However I stand to be corrected!

With my own minor surgical cut , I dropped the plate about three times
before I was able to get the first screw in.....

Anyway slit the post, before your wrists on this one.....
