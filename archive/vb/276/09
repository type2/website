No, you aren't supposed to have to ream them.  It you get a new links set, 
they come with the pin in the needle bearing in the bushing.   You are warned 
that each set is a set, so don't go swapping pieces around, like you don't mix 
and match cases halves.   

Sounds odd, I'd call up the place you got them from.

Now for the problem (there's always a problem!), The driver's side installed
fine. Now that I'm on the passenger's side, the top pin will not fit through
the bushing. The bearing cage fits in fine on it's own, but once I slide the
cage onto the pin and try to install it, the needle bearings are forced
outwards and cause the assembly to be too large in diameter to fit into the
bushing. Same happens if I install the cage first them try to slip in the
pin.

So...did bus boys neglect to ream this bushing? The manual says nothing about
