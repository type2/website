Speaking of bowden tubes, I just got my us back from the mechanic (yes, I
actually found a good VW guy that does not charge an arm and a leg and
drinks coffee!)  Among the many things that he said he has never seen on a
VW until mine, I was missing the bowden tube.  All is well, and I have have
a new bus !(that looks like my old bus and still has all my old bus stuff in
it)
