Dan,
	I fixed a blown plug on a '72 Pinz Gauer at Burning Man three weeks 
ago.  This aluminum head had long reach plugs and was fairly easy to fix 
with a repair kit on site.  In your case, I'd drop the engine and pull 
the head off and send it to a shop.  There is a system, Time Cert, that 
really works.  At Burning Man, I had to fix the Pinz just to get it off 
of the Playa.       Gary Gibson
