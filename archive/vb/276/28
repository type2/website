Subject: [VB] Jerome... Dogs?   Please, no!

Common sense. Accountability for self in general and leave the dogs with Mom or
at a kennel. Your rabid "bad assed" penile compensating Pit bulls and Rotties
do not mix well with strangers and other peoples' kids.

Leave the drugs at home or duh- perhaps don't do them and save your brain for
the years in which you will need it.

Drive safely, remember that it is *SUPPOSED* to be a family oriented club with
a desire to raise money for one or more charitible causes.

Have fun, raise the roof until ten pee-em, quiet down there after, go to bed at
a decent hour (Midnight is lenient). Be prepared to have more fun Sunday
morning, contribute financially to the fund raising and remember that there are
families ( KIDS ) present who dont need to hear the F word every two seconds.

You might win a refurbbed 13 window deluxe! =)

For myself? Pfft- Have attended Jerome, on and off, for more than 10 years...
Working Saturday 06:00-Noon, leaving three dogs at home, Slowly rolling up by
sundown for few laughs and then intending to camp near Cottonwood at night for
a good nights sleep. Let the partiers party. =)
Leave the dogs at home.   X:-op
