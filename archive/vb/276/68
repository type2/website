Subject: re: Bad advice (stiffer pressure plate)

Following a friends suggestion, I installed a stiffer pressure plate in my
65 Westy many years ago.  First it was tiring to drive, then the clutch
cable broke, then the lever where the cable connects to the clutch pedal
broke, and finally the throwout bearing carrier (wishbone) broke.  No, I
would say, stick with the stock pressure plate.
