this is something that i've been wondering about. the 241's are always
refered to as bench seat or 9 seater buses, even in factory literature that
i've seen. my 64 deluxe is a walk through with the 241 model number. BUT it
did have a full width middle seat, making it an 8 seater. the bus also has
m427 that is unkown. anyone else have a 241 walk through deluxe? or a 22
walk through standard?
