That's the thing. I never said if the bus got into an accident, and i've
never heard anyone talk about the bus in an accident when they talk about
the bulkhead being cut out. What i've heard over and over is that with the
bulkhead cut out, it will get tweaked, the body will twist, blah, blah,
blah. I've always heard that just from normal driving, going through dips,
over speed bumps, driving along dirt roads, all that will cause things to
get tweaked without it. And that's what I just can't see, and was wondering
if there is any actual info on something like this, or if it's just one of
those things that gets spread around enough that it just becomes "common
knowledge".

Of course any extra metal in the body structure will make it stronger in an
accident, but that's not what i'm talking about.

And also, i'm in no way condoning cutting out the bulkhead, this is just
something I'm wondering about. I have a bench seat and would LOVE to have a
walkthrough again, but would never cut the bulkhead out to get it. I'll sell
my bus and buy a walkthrough if I want it that bad.  ;-) Besides, it's been
a bit slow latley, and thought it might make a good discussion if people had
direct experiences to share.
