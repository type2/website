Hi Kevin,
Yes, check the voltage at the battery and see how much is getting to the 
headlights.  Also a good idea to check the fuses and headlight switch shaft for 
getting hot when driving.  For the 55/60 Watt halogens you should be fine 
without relays.  For much more wattage bulbs then one probably would need to go to 
relays.
  Still soldering the headlight switch and fuse box is a big help because the 
relays only improve the headlights by removing any voltage drop through the 
headlight switch.  One still has the coil and starter solinoid, running lights 
voltage pass through both the fuse box and headlight switch.  Plus all the 
other items like wipers, horn, turn signals, etc. the voltage to these passes 
through the fuse box.  
Also is the bulb advertised a straight swap or would I need to make some 
modifications to my headlamp assembly?
All the H-4s we have been using there is modification to any part of the 
headlamp assembly!
