Subject: Re: [VB]slider deluxes /was front seat area? 

 the samba says the 4th digit if present, is paint finish. 1 for primer, 2
for nitro lacquer, 3 for synthetic resin, but the list only goes up to 3. I
was curious about the 6 too.

the lack of a 164 makes me wonder if the roof was grafted onto the slider
bus and the m-plates and vins went with it. unless the other sliding door
buses out there are missing the m-code, it seems likely, whether the stamped
number matches the others or not.
