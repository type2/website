ya, my parts list shows M164 as sliding side door for deluxes.

I don't understand how you are getting the M codes from the overhead  airbox, 
though.  Normally the M code tag  is behind the passnger  seat.  At least in 
RHD it's behind the pass seat.   Are those  *all* the M codes on your tag?

No I am geting them from behind the passenger seat. They are all  on the tag 
bay except the 164 tag. Ronnie said about the Vin plate in the  engine.   I 
just said mine was on the  overhead airbox.  Mike
