ya I have a gas heater too... not working, in the garage lol.  A friend was
using one to heat his garage actually, worked pretty well.  ( ya the exhaust
was routed outside)

could you use a manual choke cable for control?    that might even be what
they used.

there are somes rainex type things that are supposed to repel water from the
glass.  but the design of the bus has water run through the door. which gets
water where the window slides, which will freeze when it's cold enough.

I have a way to heat and melt them I guess, the issue is that it happens
every time it gets wet, maybe the lithium grease might help?
