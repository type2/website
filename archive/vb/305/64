Subject: Re: [VB]slider deluxes /was front seat area? 

mmm.. the earlier buses had the VIN plate in the engine compartment instead 
of on the airbox overhead, ya and Ronnie has an earlier bus.     I guess I was 
confused about how you said it,   "They are all on the tag bay except the 164 
tag"  I am not sure what that means.

But were those ALL the M codes on your bus?  or are there also some others?

Roger.. the 67 slider deluxe you had... did it have the lower trim on the 
rockers?   It had the subfloors, didn't it?

I don't understand how you are getting the M codes from the overhead airbox, 
though.  Normally the M code tag  is behind the passnger seat.  At least in 
RHD it's behind the pass seat.   Are those *all* the M codes on your tag?

No I am geting them from behind the passenger seat. They are all on the tag 
bay except the 164 tag. Ronnie said about the Vin plate in the engine.   I just 
said mine was on the  overhead airbox. Mike
