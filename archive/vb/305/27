Subject: Re: [VB] front seat area?

I've owned a lot of parts buses with the wall hacked out. some where ok,
some where not, but they where parts buses so most had other problems. one
in particular was badly twisted from what looked to have been a minor
accident. if you would have replaced the lower rear corner and engine lid/
apron you wouldn't have known just to look at the body. but the cargo doors
where all out of square and the the passenger front door didn't close
properly. the drivers was stuck shut, but it looked ok, that could have been
from sitting. i have seen a bus with the walk through partition in place
tweak like that, but it was hit by a van at speed and flipped on it's side
into a block wall.

I don't think the egg theory applies, eggs don't have 5 doors. i do think
the
wall helps prevent twisting, and possibly some flex from side to side in an
accident. i don't see sagging as being a real problem though, the frame
rails
are pretty beefy.
