Subject: Burnt bus fund reachs 2000 dollars

  I almost broke out in tears when I read this, what a bus community

quote     "have loved VW's since my teen years back in the
70's and love driving/working on VW's in general and buses in particular
since then.  I am also blessed with the financial resources to continue
this hobby.  That being said, I would like to anonomously donate $1,000
to the bus fund for Chris"

This absolutley blew my mind and we now have over 2000 dollars to find Chris
a nice bus or a cheap one and the money to make road worthy. I can not say
enough of the bus community.

At BBB there was a pretty clean 70 pop top westy for 1500 dollars. I think I
will check it out more thourohly and check with her and others to see if
it's worth it.

hassel setting up. Money orders work fine contact for who to make them out
to
