Subject: Apron wanted, goodies to trade

Hey Y'all,
I am looking for a rear apron fo my 67 bus.  I would
rather not spend money ('cuz I got none!) but I have
the following parts I can trade for a use-able rear
apron:

*A couple of crank out split bus camper windows, glass
and frames with missing cranks

*Split bus Westy table, the kind that goes on the
inside of the drivers side rear passenger area

*Split westy water tank

*Late Bay (79) padded steering wheel 

*A plethera of bug & bus ash trays

*A full width rear passenger seat for a split bus
(grungy and dirty, but otherwise good-I cannot ship
this item)

*Split bus speedo guage

*Split bus gas guage

*Split bus gas tank (probably will need a good
cleaning but NO leaks)

*Bunch of side window glass for bays plus ONE REAR
WINDOW WITH DEFOGGER ELEMENTS

Anyone want to barter? Or make me a cash offer on any
of these parts, NO REASONABLE OFFER REFUSED!
