 actually, passed through, but the point is that there was a piece you
 could screw off, replace that nipple with the BD fuel tap.  possible
 that vw went to something else later; karl, you da king, did they
 change this?

then Karl answered:

75 and up tanks have two nipples fixed to the bottom, one outlet and one return. No screen, no removable
tubes....
The fuel tank screen, 111 209 147 A, was used to the end of 74.
