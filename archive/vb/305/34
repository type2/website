I agree, seems to be a severe lack of documentation to back up either point 
of view.  

I have seen a *very* rusty 63 23 window body flex as it drove down the road.  
  In a bad way.  

re:  cutting the divider... some years ago i met this guy with a new bus in 
town and was checking it out.   " Bummer how someone hacked the spare tire 
well."  I said.   He got all offended as he had just done it!!!  lol
