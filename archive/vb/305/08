What was the 'frame reinforcement for the roof.'  I plan on putting a small
pop-top on my 60.  The top is actually from a Canadian conversion company
called Dorper.  The top is very similar to the small pop-top but is, I
think, a little bigger.  I have an extra one of those roof support bows in
my bus - think that'll help.  My bus had roof problems when I got it and
since I redid the roof last summer the repair is virtually invisible ... but
still ... I got the small pop-top all painted and ready to go - just got to
cut the hole and fasten it on - anyway - what was the frame reinforcement?
