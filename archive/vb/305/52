Subject: Re: [VB] front seat area? /sliding door deluxe

I'll second Ronnie on that.   The dormobiles were made on sunroof buses.   I 
think hi roof buses had subfloors, as well as the DD and sunroof buses.  I've 
only seen a couple deluxes w/o subfloors, and they were "home made" deluxes.  
pics of your bus?

re rocker trim, I haven't seen that many sliding door deluxes,  don't 
remember , can't find the pics I thought I had of the 2 that were at Bad Camberg 5 
years ago
