hmm, your bus has m 080 or m 081, right? 
  there is a code for full width middle seat for walkthroughs, I forget which 
it is.
NEATO did an M code survey a few years back,   I seem to remember that VW 
didn't always do the mcodes the same way... and that one bus had about 3 (more?) 
codes for being a walkthrough.   If you didn't get that OBR, I could go dig it 
up.  I think Dave Easterwood was handling the M code info.   He might be able 
to tell you how many buses in the survey had that combo.

this is something that i've been wondering about. the 241's are always
refered to as bench seat or 9 seater buses, even in factory literature that
i've seen. my 64 deluxe is a walk through with the 241 model number. BUT it
did have a full width middle seat, making it an 8 seater. the bus also has
m427 that is unkown. anyone else have a 241 walk through deluxe? or a 22
walk through standard?
