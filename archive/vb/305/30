I could see it over time twisting a bit, but i wouldn't think any major
flexing would happen just from driving either.  unless you regularly carry
heavy loads or drive it hard off road.

i had a martin walter dormobile with no belly pans and you could see where
it had flexed at the seams in some places. i've never noticed anything
similar on a bus with the bench hacked out.
