Subject: 64-67 "Big Nut" Reduction Box Rebuild Pics

For those who may not venture into the Samba forums, I
have posted a bunch of pics of the procedure for
disassembling and re-assembling *big nut* reduction
boxes. Here's the link to the Samba forum thread with
a brief description of what's going on in the pics,
and the link to the pics is included there.
Enjoy, and I hope this may help.
