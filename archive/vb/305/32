Well I am home from the hospital---operated on twice in 4 days--almost died
there twice---first with phenomena--second with a screw up on drugs that
were given to me--I am trying to get on my feet --Lady Magoo will NOT allow
me into the garage--My 1967 single cab that is shortened 4 feet -- will have
to wait---it still needs a few finishing touches--but for now I still need
your prayers--
Bless all of you for all your prayers -- they were most needed and I Still
need them--OOOPPss here comes Lady Magoo--gotta go--in more ways than one
!!! uj, TWWM
