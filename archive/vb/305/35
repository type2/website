Subject: RE: [VB] front seat area?

Having worked sheet metal on racing cars back in the 70's and early 80's
I have found that if you properly box in your structure your resulting
new shape will still retain the intended integrity. I would definitely
have a 2" raised section in the walk through containing ribbed pieces
between the two seat pedestals to prevent center floor flex. Besides
that I would have to see what the factory walk through looks like.

I agree, seems to be a severe lack of documentation to back up either
point
of view.

I have seen a *very* rusty 63 23 window body flex as it drove down the
road.
  In a bad way.

re:  cutting the divider... some years ago i met this guy with a new bus
in
town and was checking it out.   " Bummer how someone hacked the spare
tire
well."  I said.   He got all offended as he had just done it!!!  lol
