Subject: Re: [VB] frozen sliders

what about going through the drive thru???   You gotta open the sliding 
window for that.   I think the dryer I dea is good. 

  I had had this problem once or twice, but it doesn't usually happen and if 
its that cold I don't open the windows much.   

Get a gas heater.   Then it'll be 70* in the bus with snow on the ground 
outside.
