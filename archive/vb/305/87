Saw a fellow stopped on the Autostrada near Rome back in 1993. His nice 
little Fiat 500 was on fire. I was passing by in my Beetle and swerved over 
and stopped handing him my fire extinguisher that I always kept in the car. 
I stayed long enough to see that the fire was out and he was calmed down 
and then left. He tried to pay me and take me home for dinner (the usual 
response - and quite valuable to a single guy living on a diet high in 
Ramine Noodles) but I hoped by in the Beetle and headed back to Naples with 
a BIG grin on my face. Felt good to help him out even if it did cost me a 
$12 extinguisher.
