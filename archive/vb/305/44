I like the tank/choke cable idea, definetly want a shut off at the tank (and 
would also like to be able to spell definetly), and would also like a 
bulkhead shutoff as the fuel line enters the engine compartment.

That's what I'm waiting to find out, what valves would be the ones to use.  
I can check the McMaster-Carr site but I need to know what size, what 
material, what type would be best.

Also, I could check to see what types/styles of filters they have availible. 
  Basically, I want to put together'the' mac-daddy fuel system, bay tank, 
double shutoff, double filtered vibration proof.
