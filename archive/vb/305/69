Subject: Re: [VB]slider deluxes /was front seat area? 

 it's not a vin plate i was looking for in the engine bay, it's the
vin number alone *stamped into the bus sheet metal*. it should be there. i
asked because if that number doesn't match the plate up front, or has been
removed it can be a good indication that it's a pieced together bus with the
m-codes swaped around to suit what ever the builder was building. or best
case that it's been hit hard enough in that corner to have to replace a good
portion of the metal. it's a good thing to keep an eye out for if you're
buying a bus to restore and pour lots of money in.

056= steering ignition lock
119= eberspacher heater
220= limited slip diff.

no mention of a slider. do you have, or have holes where there was, a gas
heater and locking steering?
