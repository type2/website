sortof a surprise... went by mainly cuz my free retest deadline was 
expiring, thought i'd see where things were going and tweak again 
later.
  new test:   HC  loaded - 117ppm    HC idle - 189       CO loaded - 
.09 %    CO idle - 2.13    pass= 500/500    4.20 / 5.50

old test:     HC loaded - 60     HC idle - 852                CO 
loaded - .26        CO idle - .20


i had: rejetted main from 120 to 122.5; emulsion from 135y to 130 y; 
idle jet from 65 to 55g.   i was getting 22mpg in the city, so it 
looks like the folks who said i was too lean were right. :)
i DO have a problem stalling at stop signs and a HUGE bog when cold 
(proper vac dizy, too), but at least now i have a year to fiddle with 
it. i will be sure to write down the jet info and turns per 
adjustment screws for next  testing time............
