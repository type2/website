Subject: weber 30mm carb?

Hi all,
I recently picked up a new single barrel weber carb. There is no literature
with it. I believe it is a 30 mm. The #s are W-223065 with L 85 stamped
below. Anyone know what this is and where I can find tuning info about it?
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
John
