This is the latest on my 911 crew cab.

It has been parked for a while waiting for money to fall from the sky. 
This came in the form of several trips to Pomona and weeding out my 2
storage units.  After one year, I finally have all the parts to put the
2 litre back together.  What started out as a valve job ended up total
rebuild.  Too bad 911 piston/cylinder sets aren't $200 like VW.

As it goes back together, I'll take plenty of pics for anyone interested
in this conversion.  A bit pricey, but great fun when finished.

Anyway, just got some pics of the body part of the resto.  I put on a
new front clip after I tapped someone.  I hit someones rear mounted
tire, so the dash had to be replaced as well.  I filled the 62-71 tail
lights in and put in the correct 61s.  These are old pics, but they are
all I have scanned.

Take a look at the decklid.  I would love to hear any ideas on
alternative decklids I could use.  The engine fan blade is flush with
the rear end of the truck, so clearance is an utter nightmare.  Even the
decklid lock is 1/4" away from the fan belt.

There's also a few shots of my 67 kombi that I had.  That was one
original bus.
