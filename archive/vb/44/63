I emailed Brian cause I want to do this, this year. He
asked me to spread the word. Check out Gene's site to
see what last year was all about. This is an event for
the people who want something rather than the lowered
shiney loud stereo buses all the time. It will happen
on ground hogs day weekend, so ask your boss of that
friday off.
 Mike
