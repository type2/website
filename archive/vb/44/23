It might also be worn throttle shaft bushings.  Grab the arm of the
throttle shaft, where the accel cable connects, and wiggle it.  If you
can see or feel play, gas could be leaking from where the throttle shaft
passes through the carb body.  Rub your finger around these spots and
check for moistness.  The fix in this case is to have the bushings bored
out and replaced by a machine shop like Rimco.

My 30-PICT-1 is just starting to leak in this manner.
