Subject:  RE: [VB] Pop-out screws

Greetings All,

I'd go and buy a 3mm drill bit and a 3.5mm tap (and handle).
Is my memory right for screw size (3.5 mm)?

Just drill em out with a 3mm drill...punch the centers of the existing
screws first
- you've gotta try and drill em out centre, then separate the frames and
retap the hole.

If you really miss centre or go too large just get someone
the mig up the old holes, and then drill and tap new ones on
assembly.......

I'm REALLY frustrated.  I've spent most of the day trying to remove the
small screws that hold the pop-out frames together.
