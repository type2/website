Subject: Looking for a Double Door panel

I am looking for a 61 or earlier Double Door panel and would prefer a
walk thru. I would consider any split window panel van though. I am very
negotialble and open for trade ideas. We just built a new house and my
wife wants these gone. I aslo have a 60 Double Cab and would be
interested in any cool parts that could go towards that would work on my
double cab such as a canvas for the back or BRM wheels or any other cool
accessories.

Two bugs will trade for one bus or sell out right.

1972 Convertible Super Beetle project. Was a running and driving car
with all new brakes. Car was disassembled for restoration and never
finished. Includes most parts including top and frame. NO ENGINE. Good
tranny and brakes. Also includes sunshine yellow paint to finish the
restoration. $800 or offer.

1963 Ragtop bug with some cool accessories. This is an original white
bug and would make an excellent Herbie replica. Comes with a bamboo
parcel tray, one piece Wolfsburg floor mat, aftermarket wood slat roof
rack and extra fenders, deck lid and hood. Needs pasenger side floor
pan  and all mechanicals gone through. NO ENGINE. This is a very
restorable car. $800 (includes extras) or offer. Will sell seperate of
accessories.

thanks

ps - I have been clean for about six months now without even wishing for
a new bus. Time has come to start pestering the wife again and telling
of the plans for the perfect panel van.
