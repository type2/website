Subject: Signing off (for now)

Hello All,

This is it for the time being.  We're moving, and the list pile will
overflow, and we'll be too busy to enjoy it, so we're signing off until
after Thanksgiving at least.

Sounds like Brian Piercy is wanting to do another Shasta Snow Trip (go to
www.sonic.net/~mizamook/Linkspage.htm and click on Shasta Snow Trip to get
an idea of what that's all about.

Hey, the agent up where I'm moving to has a sandrail with a 1776 that he'll
happily haul out to my new place for me for the price of me taking it off
his hands!  Nothing like having a spare engine when you've got a four hour
commute!

BTW, we're moving to the Garberville/Redway area of N. Cal., actually, west
of there, near Briceland, maybe there's some Listees there?

Anyway, gotta go.  My email still will work, but I won't be getting messages
for a couple weeks, and I'll have no phone for a while.  That sucks.

I'll see ya on the other side of whatever....

Keep on Bussin!

Gene Cornelius
