Ronnie,

Thanks for the discovery on the heat flap in the defrost tube.  I will check 
my '56 Kombi this weekend and see if it has the flap.  This could explain why 
the heat comes out the floor OK but when closed, I don't seem get the same 
volume of air out the defrosters.

How is the rubber gasket around the stop light on that '56?  I need one, and 
none of the rubber replacement places seem to have them.  I am about ready to 
cut up an old inner tube.

Thanks,
Jim Cahill
56 Kombi
