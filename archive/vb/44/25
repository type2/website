Subject: 40 Hp engine saga

What was wrong with the 40 Hp. engine for my 23-window bus was indeed too mu=
ch
Permatex (got under the bearings and decreased the clearance) and metal burr=
s=20
that
needed to be sanded from the bearings (clearance too tight). The 40 hp engin=
e=20
now=20
turns around freely, and the crankshaft end play is now fixed without having=

to hammer the crank back and forth.

Lee Roy at Knight's Foreign Auto Parts figured out what was wrong. I guess=20
Scott is
not too swift an engine builder, but he'll learn with time. Lee Roy is gonna=

shave 0.007 off the flywheel so that we can run two 30's and a 32 crankshaft=

shims. The latter fits the shims that we have in hand and gives an end play=20
of 0.006.

I think this same problem is what's wrong with the 25 Hp. Hebm=FCller engine=

At least we're gonna try to fix it this way.

Meanwhile, we bought beaceaup parts for the 1974 Super Beetle plus a front=20
bumper
for the 1971 bus, four axle-boots, and 7-feet of vacuum hose for the 1971=20
plus a dual port intake manifold for the 1971. The dual port manifold is for=

the disc brakes on the 1971. Right now the 1971 has a Bugpack dual carbureto=
r=20
that we're gonna replace with a PICT-3. The Bugpack carb is built for a much=
=20
larger engine and stalls on the engine in the bus.
