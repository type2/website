Subject: Re: [VB] Pop-out screws

Hi Ed,
If you have soaked them with penetrating oil for the past few weeks and still 
can not get them out you might try heating them and quenching with water to 
break up the rust in there.  We have heard that melting parafin into the hot 
screws works well also.  If all else fails you just have to center punch each 
screw head and use a drill bit about .015" (or smaller if you are not good 
keeping center/straight with a drill!) smaller diameter than the threaded 
screw shaft.  You need to drill at least enough so you can pop off the heads 
of the screws.    Eric&Barb
