Went to the Bulli Brigade show in Tampa today. Saw 74 split window buses
all together in a VW dealership ( Reeves Volkswagen) who graciously allowed 
the
best show in the southeast as far as buses are concerned to happen. I saw 2 
binzs, 2 highroofs; several awesome restorations; a totally restored sunroof 
standard done by Mark Rafferty; & a totally unusualy project by Panama Mike 
from Jacksonville which consists of the chasis and motor of a Toytota truck 
that is water-cooled & has the body of a single cab on it.  Probably the most 
unsusual converstion I ever seen or hope to ever see.  Mike Brown greatly.  
The caravan has the show consisted of 33 split window buses along with an 
assortment of bay windows, vanagans, cool beatles & an assortment of water 
cooled VWs of all types.  There were also two  vintage trailers one was the 
vw parts guy. Missed the party after the show but expect it was a riot 
considering the fun I saw at the show.Tomorrow am headed to the Florida Bug 
Jam Which is always great.
