Subject: Pop-out screws

I'm REALLY frustrated.  I've spent most of the day trying to remove the
small screws that hold the pop-out frames together.  Although my frames
are in ok shape, the screws all seem to be rusted into their holes.
I've tried 6,473 different screwdrivers, and I seem to just break the
heads of the screws.  I went to one tool store, and they have a set of
screw extractors, which each fit into your electric drill.  The
extractor has a small blade-like device which, when your drill turns it,
cuts down into the head of the screw, and supposedly removes it.  The
set costs $40, which seems a bit much to remove 16, (I have four
pop-outs) screws.  I did get two others though.  One is a drill like
device.  You drill a small hole into the top of the screw head, thread
this device in, and it is supposed to grip the sides of the hole you
made and back the screw out.  Didn't work, it just made the hole
larger.  The other operates on the same principle, it is square and you
make a hole and then turn it and it's supposed to back out the screw.
Also didn't work.

I suppose that the tiny $%&#(-at-) screws were not made to be removed.  I'm
about ready to fill in the window holes in my camper with plywood.
Anybody got any suggestions?
