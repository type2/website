Subject: Re: [T2] Jake Raby motor reviews ?

Chris,

Aside from the Type 1 and Type 4 engines I've purchased from Jake, I know 
several other people who have gone through Raby's VW as well. I recently 
traded the car away that has a Type 1 (1776) in it from Jake, and after 2.5 
years, several thousand miles, and many 4-grand front-tire-lifting-launches 
the car is still going very strong.

The most amazing thing about his engines is how cool they run. I picked up 
my 72 Camper (with a fresh engine) this past Tuesday night and drove it over 
100 miles home without fail. When I pulled in the driveway, I went around 
back and put my hand all over the engine with no fear of getting burned 
(kids don't try this at home). It sounds un-orthodox, but that is one of the 
ways he'll have you check to make sure it's running right. My wife and I did 
the 1999 Hippie Days run in our bug with the 1776 with only 1200 miles on 
the engine, by the time we got home we had racked up over 700 extra miles - 
hit over 100 mph (racing Jake) and never once had any troubles. Everytime we 
stopped for gas or directions people would come over and look at the engine 
and want to touch it. No one could believe that it was running that cool.

Sure, this may sound a little biased, but that's only because in the 11 
years I've been in the VW world, I have been rooked by almost every crooked 
or sorry VW mechanic in the state of GA. Jake's attention to detail and 
strong belief in customer service are the reasons this sounds so flowery - 
other than well-deserved grattitude, I don't owe him anything.

If you'd like to talk some more about this, feel free to send me a pmail.

Oh yeah - most everything he builds comes with a warranty that he actually 
stands by!
