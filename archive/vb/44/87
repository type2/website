 I am looking for a set of used mud flaps. Just as long
 as they are black w/logo and don't have any burn marks
 from exhaust or excessive wearing at the bottom from
 being too low. I have the brackets.

I have a set of new ones made in Brazil, I think. I'm not happy with them 
because they have the logo painted on and the painting is not straight. They 
need to be repainted. The mud flaps are black with white VW logo. I will let 
them go for what I
have into them, which is about $65 + shipping. They are bus mud flaps and 
they have the brackets as well.
