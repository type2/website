Subject: Re: [VB] Pop-out screws

Warning: Do *NOT use those extractors in an electric drill with or wothout a
clutch or variable speed, if it is a very important job.  Those bass turds
are known to break if not turned with a hand-held, small wrench.   I know a
guy who broke one in an oil-pressure sender's threads once and then couldn't
drill out the "tool steel" that I...er, he  left broken off down in the
threads.  Ended up dropping the T4 2.0 litre just to correct.   If you don't
know, removing the t4 isn't like the t1 "lego separation" engine pull.
Argh!  Ok, it was me.  Good luck, Jay
