from the library:

to wit:  you'll probably want to plug the port on your intake manifold,
although you could probably use that port interchangibly with the
port that is on the Rear (Rear Is Rear) of your carb.  Both of these
ports should be roughly equivalent, although if the vacuum port
on your intake manifold is off to one side of the manifold, the vacuum
there will vary somewhat based on which cylinder is firing.

anywho, read David Schwarze's writeup on engine vacuum, it's required
reading when trying to learn all this stuff:

good luck!
