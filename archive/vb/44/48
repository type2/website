Subject: Missouri VW Fallout gathering next weekend

Hi all,

Just a reminder that this coming weekend November 16,17 and 18, is the
weekend of the Missouri VW fallout. This had in the past been a mainly bus
event, but since fall camping seems to have a lower turnout this year we
decided to make the theme volkswagens in general, rather than busses
specifically. This is, however an oficial NEATO (bus club) event so expect
to see lots of busses. Last year and the year before we had a turnout of
well over 10 type 2's and several other Veedubs, and 1 1954 GMC schoolbus
converted to a motorhome.

We will be bringing both my 81 diesel rabbit pickup and my 61 micro.

For directions, detalis etc. go to:

Hope to see you there,

Stephen White
President, Missouri Micros

P.S. please feel free to forward this to any other list or persons where
you think there might be interest.
