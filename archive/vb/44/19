Subject: Re: Az Cold? Really!

Yes--There was a time in AridZona when we actually did get Winter!!
For 4 days I had Snow in my back yard that was in the shade!! Of course that
was the same year that we had 121 degrees in the summer or is that Simmer?--
No doubt you would really need a Many Multi Grade oil for your Splittie--
Running straight 50W in the "Simmer" here with daily temps at 110+ is a real
test for 3 quarts of oil to do the cooling--If you want to see your oil
light come on real fast at idle--  just try using 30W at 115+ degrees--after
about a 1/2 hour at 65MPH--But then its a "Dry" heat--
TWWM, uj
PS: Bessie will be at Karl's VW show in Mesa this Sunday with her Puck--
