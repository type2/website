Hi Martin,
The flap and all the rest are going to be swap meet, junk yard or some VW 
fiend's garage finds.  The correct rear tin for a 40 HP engine will not fit 
due to the wider spacing of the 1500 engine between heat riser tubes.  The 
most likely find you will be able to fit in there is a 1967 only bug rear tin 
with heat riser holes of correct size, but on both side of the rear pulley.  
Then all you need to do is plug or weld up the hole on the right side.  As 
for the air cleaner bracket make sure it has the dimple in it for clearance 
of the fresh air tube coming out of the shroud.  The pre-DEC1962 VWs had no 
fresh air tubes due to being stale air engines!   Eric&Barb
