A dry cold? YES!
OK Fitz, if you want to 'speriment about how funny the "dry cold" affects you
then come on down to a place near Phoenix called White Tank Mountain Regional
Park for a campout on December31-January 01. Bring the non-insulated Panel bus
and a T-shirt, no bed roll or jacket. You can camp, freeze celebrate the New
Year AND dodge bullets at the same time. Alternative would be the Tucson meet
in early March just before the Desert starts to heat up. No bullets there, just
shots.
