Now your talking.  Chuck, just how do you have such "intimate" knowledge of
the Signal Hill area?

For those who have never heard of Signal Hill, its a small city built on a
hill that pokes up out of the surrounding area.  It is surrounded on ALL
sides by Long Beach.  Was the site of much oil pumping and still provides a
bit of oil.  Shell Hill is one VERY steep drive and the top is where oil was
first discoverd on the hill.  It has been used as a launching pad for all
types of contests.  I think they used to have a Ford Model T hill climbing
contest on an annual basis.

We have been using the the traverse over Signal Hill to practice.  She's been
driving the truck up Cherry which is just a good incline, not a killer one.
That's the same route that I smoked up my clutch after finding myself in
bumper to bumper traffic up the hill a few months ago.  Its on the way home
from her high school.  I have kept her away from Shell Hill, maybe it's time
we pay it a visit.

The summer after high school, I had a job as a laborer working with an oil
company on that hill.  We were installing pipelines all over the place for
ARCO.  There came the time when we had to cut across the road and narrow it
down to one lane.  We set up traffic control, but did people pay attention to
it?  Nope.  By the time they got to me, they had passed the bottom control
point and with people already coming down the hill, the up hill travelers had
to STOP mid-hill.  Talk about being pissed.  I've never been called so many
colorful unheard of names in such a short period.

That is the place if anyone in SoCal wants to some intense hill practice in
their bus.  The city has made sure that there are plenty of stop signs along
any stretch of hill to make you slow down as you are going down.  That
translates into plenty of stops while going up hill.
