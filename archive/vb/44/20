We just drove down 99 from Hayward (east bay south of Oakland) to Hesperia.  We
prefer 99 over 5 for the same reasons you stated, more helpful people along the
way and the cars and trucks do not run you over too bad while traveling at 50.
We go up 138 over Tehachapi and through Mojave to 395 and 395 does go south to
San Diego.

101 is also a pretty good road but have not driven our bus on it ... yet.
There is one pass there and it is steeper but not as high.

It will depend in part on weather also.  101 is usually worse in wet weather
(more curves) and both 101 and 99 can suffer from fog.  You should be early
enough not to have winter weather (since it is 80 here in Hesperia today.)

On our 4 month VW bus journey (we just arrived home from) we drove 5 for about
250 miles total, from here to Washington and back, mostly in short stretches.
One stretch of 3 miles in Oregon we drove about 5 times between my cousins and
uncles since this was the only way over the river.  Until we found the ferry.  A
4 car ferry tops.  You could throw a rock across the river.

We will either be in Hesperia (395) or Ventura (101), so send us an email and
let us know your route and schedule.

This drive should be easy - slow and steady does it.  You have pre-flighted the
bus right??
