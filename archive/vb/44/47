Subject: how can you tell if...

I just picked up some mystery wheels from a friend of the original owner that 
bought them in the early 70's (wide 5 look like American Racing knockoffs, 
maybe aluminum centers with steel rims) He thought they were Empi's but no 
they most defiantly are not (bummer!) They have no markings on them as far as 
I can tell. I was showing them to a few older American Hot rodder guys and 
they seemed to think they were magnesium wheels. How can you tell the 
difference between magnesium and aluminum? I know you can burn them to see, 
but I don't really want to screw them up. As soon as I can borrow a digital 
camera I will post some pics to maybe help with identifying them.

Thanks,
Brian
