George,

Ooops.  That .006 I wrote should have been .060!  I meant to have said I
shimmed the cylinders 60 thousandths...not 6 ten thousandths!  The engine is
.120 wider.  Not much, but that is the only thing I can think of for the tin
miss fit.  In all other respects the cylinder cover tin fits like it
should.  Tight against the exhaust ports and the attachment screw hole
around the intake hole are in the proper spot.

BTW I'm using a German exhaust and it still fits...even with the wider
engine.

Steve
