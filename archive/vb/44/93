Ed,

Carefully drill out the screws with an appropriate sized drill. If you do
it nicely, you won't bung up the threads, and have to retap for a larger
size and then have to look for matching screws. I went thru this with my
restoration. They drill out easy. Use a bit of cutting oil as well, to
save wear on the bit. Go easy and lightly, and you'll be done in no
time. WW sells the screws, and I believe so did Vintage Parts, Burbank.

If you use a small bit, the vibration usually loosens the screw up anyway,
and some Liquid Wrench will allow it to be removed by turning and or
prying, without ruining the threads.

As others have mentioned, if you ruin the threads, have someone weld it
up, sand it smooth, punch it, drill, thread it. 

When you reassemble, coat the threads with anti-sieze (Loctite/Permatex
133K).
