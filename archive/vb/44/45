I would appreciate it if you would forward this for me too.

 I've been filtered for a week or so now. Apparently the massive
proliferation of teen porn posts to this subscription-only list have
motivated the admins to install filters. It is not you per se, Chris, it is your
IP address they are bouncing. If you wish to post to the list, you must change
ISP's. Then, if the new ISP gets included on the spam list that they use, you
will have to move again. If you followed the link on the message that came with
your bounce notification, you will see that it is up to you to notify your ISP
that they are harboring spammers and that they should change their ways so that
you may post to the list again. Since Qwest has
never responded to an e-mail request for technical support, I doubt they will be
moved by such a request from myself. All responses to posts that I have made
lately have gone to the original poster, but bounced from the list. I can take a
hint.

 My last couple of messages were bounced back to me by the
