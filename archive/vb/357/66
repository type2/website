This is the proper maintenance - who's joking.  The VW dealers along the 
road have been advised to have a bay open and mechanics ready when the 
cruise rolls in.  Rumor has it near St Louis a VW dealer has offered oil 
changes for all of the VWs in the cruise.  There will be a trailer of 
parts and tools and VOA threw in their museum mechanic.  The cruise will 
not be stopped for breakdowns but there will be folks to help. 

We plan to have the airs list with us but if there are any additional 
people along the route who want to offer help like storage space or work 
space or towing for vehicles that cannot continue the cruise, send us a 
pmail with name and full contact information and we will put you on our 
list we carry and not publish it if desired.  Just let us know in a pmail.

thanks
P & C
