Hi Gene,
BTDT!!  Barb got a crash course in driving without clutch due to same  reason 
in LA freeway rush hour traffic, and did very well!  Best  to take the old 
front clutch lever, weld up the whole area and redrill the  hole.  Any other old 
used lever is going to be on its way out the same  way.  Unless you find a 
NOS one!!
