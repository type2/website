I had to drive approx 150 miles today mostly on I-95,  it was
intermittently not having any get up and go, once I got to 65mph it
cruised fine.  sometimes it felt fine, better as I got more miles under it
and it got warm, but never got over 200F (oil sump sender)

?? I'm not sure if it has a condenser or not, I really don't remember,
will have to check, first thing I plan on doing is changing the
distributor cap and fuel filter  since it gets real hard to start when it
is damp and humid. (but not when raining??)
