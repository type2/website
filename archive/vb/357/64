Yes, I removed the bushing 20 years ago, and I glue the bolt in. It stays
there until I need to remove the tranny, and allows me to simply thread a
nut on from the rear, and tighten/loosen it with the handy flat ratcheted
17mm wrench from Sears or Proto. See my page on how to glue the bolts
(yes, both) in properly. Makes the engine removal/install a quick and
clean operation.
