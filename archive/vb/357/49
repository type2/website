Subject: Clutch Lever Thingy Needed

Um....so a year ago, Michele and I were bouncing over rocks and through
gullies in the campsite roads near Mt. Shasta, and suddenly, as two hippies
come out of the woods, to inquire after a ride, the clutch pedal goes to the
floor gently, and I think bad thoughts.  Turns out it was not the cable, nor
was it anything that required moving an engine out of the way to fix.  It
was the little lever that the clutch cable attaches to up front.  Instead of
a smooth pin, there was a threaded bolt through the cable eye, which had
been eaten through by the threads.  Lucky us, that little arm is reversible,
and with a little work, we were back on our way...knowing that the end of
the arm/lever thing, instead of having a hole through which goes the pin,
was terminated in a sort of hook.

Anyway, all that was unnecessarily written, but what the hay.  I flaked on
it until now....we are about to go on a solo hard driving trip, into the
wilds of N. Cal, and I don't want that thing giving up the ghost in the
middle of nowhere.

Anyone got one to send to me?  I'll pay whatever it's worth and shipping...I
just need it by Tuesday or Wednesday.
To fit a '66 bus.

Thanks.

p.s.  The hippies left.
