Reminds me of an experience I once had in Mexico.  I was driving south on
Mex. 15 between Obregon and Navojoa at a fairly fast clip in my old
Datsun.  I came up behind a VW bus "ambulancia" and swung out to pass it.
As I pulled back into the lane in front of the bus, I was surprised to
look in my rear view mirror and see the red light on the front of the bus
flashing furiously.  There wasn't a flashing light on the back of the bus,
so there was no way to know that it was on a "run" before passing it!  I'd
be a bit foolish to pull over for a vehicle I had just passed, so I kept
my foot in it and the bus soon dropped back out of sight.

Thinking about it, my '71 wouldn't have been able to keep up the speed I
was making in the Datsun, so the splitty ambulance didn't have a chance!
