Hi ronnie



Welded nut should do fine, it will not come out the inner side of the brake  
backing plate unless the bolts was threaded its entire length.  Are you  
applying a little grease or better yet "never sieze"?  We even lube up the  brake 
line nuts and brake wheel cylinder relief valves to avoid stuck and broken  
fasteners down the road.
