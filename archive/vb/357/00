Subject: curtain hardware

Hi:

I have a 66 Kombi that I want to put curtains in. We will be making our 
own custom curtains, but I need the hardware.

I would love to have OG rods, but I am not hung up on it. The British 
curtain makers use Silent Gliss tracks, but can't ship to US.

Can anybody help me locate some hardware?

Thanks in advance,

Mark
