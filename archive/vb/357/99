Hi Eric & Barb

I think the real key is the part that says air can enter the
crankcase. The crankcase is sort of a pulsing between vacuum and
overpressure as the pistons move up and down. If air is sucked in
through a valve cover leak on a vacuum pulse, there is more air in the
crankcase on a pressure pulse, and by the gas law more gas is more
pressure, forcing oil out anywhere it can get out.
