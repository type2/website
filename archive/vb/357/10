Hi Clark,

Search the archives or go to thesamba.com and search in the split bus
forums there... there is a lot of information regarding what is what
when it comes to safari windows.

I am continuing the renovation of my 67 Westfalia, and I'll soon be
pulling the windshield.  I found an ad on eBay for a set of new,
aftermarket, safaris at:

I can't imagine there are too many manufacturers of this kind of
product, does anyone know whether these are of decent quality?  I
understand some don't have the reinforcing rib inside.  Who makes/sells
the best one?

When you find an original set, they are in such poor condition I can't
imagine the fact that they are original make them better functionally,
but please correct me if I'm wrong.
