An announcement:

NEW VW BUS BOOK: A collection of stories of life and adventure with the VW
Bus is coming together! Were looking for tales of travel adventure;
tidbits of daily life with a VW Bus; memories of your first sighting of a
Bus; the first Bus you ever owned; weddings and celebrations where VW Buses
held a prominent position; stories of Bus enthusiasm passed down from
generation to generation-anything related to the glories (and agonies) of
VW Busing. Photos and artwork are welcome. The book has an emphasis on
pre-1968 Type 2s, but stories of later year Buses and Vanagons are very
welcome, too.

If you have material youd like to contribute, or for more information,
please contact Tom Brouillette (former editor of NEATOs Old Bus Review)
at: <mailto:type2tom(-at-)earthlink.net>type2tom(-at-)earthlink.net.
