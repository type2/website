Subject: Busted zerks and hard starting

Hey all,
Did a tune up on my '65 Bus that I aquired recently and discovered two busted off grease zerks. One is on the beam, the other on the king pin assembly. Anyone ever try to drill out a busted zerk? These are snapped off flush, but I wonder if it is a good idea to drill them out.
I also am having a hard time with starting this beast. Its a fresh 1600 sp with newish 30/31 PICT carb and a brand new, well aircooled.net rebuilt '68-'70 series dizzy. I am running points in it, which I replaced with the tuneup. I have the diz timed at TDC, as specified by the VW manual. When going to start it, especially after it has run and the choke is off, I have to turn it over several times and step on the gas to get it to kick over. I have adjusted the carb to what sounds right by ear and it idles and runs fine when started. All my other VWs kick over with one twist of the ignition, but this one wants to fight it. Any ideas? Sound like a carb issue or ignition?
