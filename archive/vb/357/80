Hi Dan,
Yes it does!  When you say you have timed the distributor by the  manual, 
which manual?  Best distributor website (and a lot  more other info) we have 
found is (-at-):
_http://www.oldvolkshome.com/_ (http://www.oldvolkshome.com/) 
 
We would check for voltage drop throughout the wiring system, or at least  
the difference between the voltage at the battery and the voltage getting to the 
 coil and solenoid.  Soldering the brass clips in each fuse box pocket  
together and doing the headlight repair in the type2.com library is a must for  max 
voltage.  Of course clean and tighten both battery cables and the  tranny to 
body cable.  
  After that take out the starter and clean it out, replace starter  brushes 
if they are shorter than the cages they ride in. Even pull engine and  check 
starter bushing for wear by wiggle testing the starter shaft, if you can  see 
more wiggle in the 7 to 2 O'clock plain than the 10 to 5 O'clock plain the  
bushing needs to be replaced.
  If all that is good to go then you should move onto the  carb....
  As for the zerks get a set of left hand drill bits and use those to  drill 
out the pieces.  If there is any chance for the zerks to just come  out these 
drills will grab and spin the remains out.  DO NOT use an Easy  Out in these.  
Easy Outs are hardened and when broken off in a blind hole  the only way to 
remove the Easy Out remains is to grind.
