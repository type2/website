You might just take it to a welding shop and have new metal welded on and
then drill the proper hole.  That's what I've been doing with all my VW
clutch levers as they need them.  Finding one in good condition is not all
that likely unless you get one that has already been repaired.

If you feel really fancy you could drill the hole oversize and press in a
bushing, making the wear surface replacable!
