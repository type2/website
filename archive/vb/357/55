Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch Lever Thingy Needed

If we're talking about VW # 211 721 374 Clutch Pedal Shaft to Cable
Lever, I've got a bag of about a dozen brand new ones sitting in a box
somewhere - fits 50-67 Type 2.  Made in Brazil (and the proper size
too), but I've never had a problem with 'em as long as they're greased
up after installing the clutch cable clevis clip.

I'm sure some of the vendors on the list carry them in their inventory.

Pmail if interested
