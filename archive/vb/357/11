Clark -

Wolfgang International sells them for the same price (I am not affliated 
w/ Wolfgang & have know experience w/ them). 

I think the bottom line on safaris is:
    * there are a few aftermarket kits out there all of which work but 
none as good as original VW safaris
    * if you plan on driving in the rain be aware of the fact the they 
leak
