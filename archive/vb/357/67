<Short version>
Does the idle jet participate in the mixture at 60mph on 4th gear with
a stock tranny on a 1600dp ?
<End of short version>


<Long version>
Here was the setup: Brosol 30/31 idle 65 main 120 air correction 125Z
Power jet 50
Dual Vacuum dizzy
1600cc dp stock AFAIK

Has been running hotter than optimal at 60mph on long runs. That means
it gets to 227 degrees when driven reasonably - measured with the Gene
Berg dipstick sensor.

I started with putting a 125 main. Seems to run cooler.

Now I would like to downsize the idle from 65 to 60 or 55. (To save
gas when driving around town).  However I do not want to lean it at
cruising speed on 4th gear (60mph).

Question : is the idle circuit (idle jet modulated by the idle mixture
screw) providing ANY mixture at the above cruising speed ? If yes,
what fraction of the mixture comes from the idle circuit ?

This page seems to say that it does not provide significant mixture
above 2500rpm  : http://www.geocities.com/vwresource/jets#jet
