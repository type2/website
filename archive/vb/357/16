Sure...

These will have at least three wires.  If there's a black one, that's
usually ground, then one is an input and the other is an output.
Sometimes input and output have two wires each: sometimes the two
ground wires are common and sometimes not.  Anyway, hook up ground
to a battery, and hook your voltmeter across what you think is the
output wire and ground.  Briefly touch the input wire to 6 V (maybe
through a 10 A or so fuse) and watch for the meter to respond.  If
no response, try it again, then try swapping the input and output
leads.

Some of these may whine audibly when they are working.  Not all of
them do, but some.  You might have to put the thing right up next
to your ear to hear it, or it might be loud.

All 3 terminals should be open circuit to the outer metal case.

The two low-voltage terminals should have a very low resistance
between them - on the order of a couple of ohms.

Either low-voltage terminal to the high-voltage terminal should
yield a higher resistance in the .... umm... don't remember, but
it's at least a few hundred ohms and possibly more.
