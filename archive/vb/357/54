Subject: 65 Reduction Boxes

Hi All,

My friend who is helping me put together the 65 Westy said that I have
mismatched reduction gear boxes on the right and left sides.

We are trying to find out which one is correct for the year, and if
the wrong one is compatible with the other one. I know some can have
different gear ratios, so we are worried this will cause problems.

If this is the case, does anyone have one they can spare, along with
the correct brake hardware?

Thanks,

John
