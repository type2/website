Subject: pulley leak

Got an oil leak at the pulley, and am on the second pulley.  First was a 
used original, second was a used degree pulley/  I'm sure I know the answer, 
but, what is the recommended best hold in the oil pulley or method to make 
the oil stay in?  Please don't explain the PFM way the pulley keeps the oil 
in.
