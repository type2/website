Does the idle jet participate in the mixture  at 60mph on 4th gear with a 
stock tranny on a 1600dp ?

Hi Arnaud,
Yes, but that is not really what is going to affect higher RPMs, unless you  
have a huge jet in there which will not run well at idle.
  Best if you have an air/fuel gauge setup, but can be done in the  following 
way to get close enough.
  Install a small size main jet (See "Without  Guesswork" manual  through the 
vintagebus.com website for stocker sized engines), then test the  engine with 
smaller and smaller pilot jets.  Having a jetting gauge is a  must because 
old jets can be worn or DPO drilled them out OR even new  ones often turn out to 
be a different size from what is stamped on  them!!!!  Once you can not 
adjust the air fuel mixture screw to  compensate for the smaller pilot jet that 
does not allow idling, go up in  size two or three sizes of pilot jets.
  Follow this with driving in the 1,500-2,500 RPM range and try  smaller and 
smaller main jets till you can not get a good amount of get up and  go.  Go up 
one or two sizes from this for your final main jet size.
  For the 2,000 to 2,500 on up RPM range install bigger and bigger air  
correction jets (these allow more air into the air fuel mixture at higher RPMs  to 
keep it from getting too rich) till you feel the engine kind of hiccup.   So 
at that point go down one or two sizes of air correction jet.
 
  We feel you need to RPM/MPH each gear!!  Good to know  where 3,000 RPM (-at-) 
what MPH in 1-4th gears and 1,500 (-at-) what MPH in 2-4th  gear.
