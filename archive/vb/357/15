Are you sure the outside turn signals are working reliably?  Do they
have the right bulbs in them?  The original VW turn signal flashers
wouldn't turn on the speedo indicator light if the outside lights
weren't drawing enough current (one bulb burned out, or bulb of too
low wattage installed).  The flasher will still click and the working
outside lights will still flash, but the speedo light won't come on.

A bad connection at the speedo is a possibility.  If your Bus is stock,
you'll have a nine-prong box.  Find this box and the blue wire with a
white stripe connected to the KBL terminal.  Pull the wire off the
terminal and ground the wire end to the body - the speedo indicator
light should come on.  If it flickers, then you most likely have a
bad connection at the speedo or a bad blue/white wire from the speedo
to the 9-prong box.  If not, you might get the wire end connected
securely to ground (the turn indicator in the speedo will be on all
the time) and drive around to see if you have a loose connection that
is affected by vibration.

This is a little further down the list, but a flasher that is starting
to crap out can get flaky with the indicator light.  Check the wires
for tight connections first, thow.
