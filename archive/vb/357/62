I have found that there is a particular sweet spot when touring with other
buses.  Up to about four buses helps to ensure that one of them will have
a needed part or tool in case of mechanical mishap.  More than four only
helps to ensure that there will _be_ a mechanical mishap that will delay
the entire group!  :)
