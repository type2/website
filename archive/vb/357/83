Hey there,
I used the thin blue Bentley for 68-70 Beetles, which is the same diz I have in the Bus. I also checked the site you referred me to and the timing is the same, TDC.
I guess I misrepresented my problem. My starter works fine. The Bus turns over no problem, it just that it has to turn over several times before it fires up and then will only fire up if I push the accelerator down about half way. Not sure what that is an indication of, too rich? Too lean? Something else?

Hi Dan,
Yes it does! When you say you have timed the distributor by the manual, 
which manual? Best distributor website (and a lot more other info) we have 
found is (-at-):
