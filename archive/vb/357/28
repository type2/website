Subject: Friday Police Roof Lights

Good for Friday. The LHC city auction in Sat. They have 16 sets of "Patrol
Vehicle Lights" up for auction. These are the red/blue/clear flashing light
bars on roofs from mid 90's cop cars. Was thinking of bidding, but don't want
all 16. Anyone else interested? Look cool on our bus roofs at night shows.
Know not legal for highway use, would be fun though. We could sure light up
Fri. Classic Campout!. Pmail if insterested with how much you would be willing
to pay. Need to know tonight.  Can bring to the Classic in June.
