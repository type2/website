Subject: Brosol 30/31 vacuum port vacuum advance dizzy.

Hello,
Tomorrow I will swap the 009 for a stock dizzy on my 1971 1600ccc dual
port. I do not have the dizzy part # handy but know that it is one of
these VW 211-905-205Q, Bosch 0231 167 055 or 211-905-205S, 0231 180
001 , 0231 176 033. Thanks to

The vacuum can has two connectors. A small one and a larger one. Now
here is where I get lost:

1) The vacuum retard is the smaller connector on the vacuum can and it
is hooked up on the right hand side of the Brosol 30/31 (near the idle
speed screw). Right ?

2) the Brosol has 2 (if not three? ) vacuum ports on the back side of
the carb. Which one should I use for the vacuum advance ? Why is there
more than one such port ? I hate these because they are so leak-prone.

3) What is this gizmo screwed in the left hand side of the lid. I have
seen pictures where hoses connect it to a two port flat device on the
carb. I believe the thing on the carb is throttle positioner. But then
what is this thing next to the door ? I have the gizmo but it just
sits there, not connected to anything.

Thanks
- Arnaud
