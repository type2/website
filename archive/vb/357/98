Hi again John,
Ah!  Found it:
Workshop Bulletin of 22 December 1970
  Modifications on Engines
  Cylinder head cover
 The upper sealing surface of the cylinder head cover (Part No. 113  101 475 
B) has a locating lug.  This ensures that the gasket cannot  move.
  With this type of cylinder head cover, only the straight type of  gasket 
will be used (Part No. 113 101 481 E/F).
  Assembly Note:
After clamping the cover in position with the cover retaining spring, the  
cover should be centered by tapping it lightly on the side. This ensures that  
the gasket makes even contact.
  For cylinder head covers without lug (Part No. 113 101 475 A) will  be used 
together with gasket, Part No. 113 101 483 B.  These parts remain  availible.
