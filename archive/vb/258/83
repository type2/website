Hi Jdd,
Kind of depends on the year!  Somewhere starting in the 1950s you buy at 
least three kits from your VW dealer that supplied you with one only reverse 
light.  One had a round light that looks from the photos to only fit on left side 
Euro bumpers, one was rectangle that would fit under the left overrider tube, 
and the third rectangle that was cut into the sheet metal to the left of the 
engine compartment.  Of course for RHD countires these lights would be mounted 
on the right side.  All of these reverse light used a switch mounted under the 
bus and a clip screwed to the shift linkage.  When you would shift into 
reverse the clip would push against the switch and turn on the reverse light.
  Sometime in the 1960s the VW dealers had a reverse light switch that 
mounted between the speedo and the speedo cable and when you backed about turn of 
the front left wheel the switch turned on the light.  
  Halfway through the 1967 model year the reverse light pair was finally 
factory installed with a reverse light switch built into the tranny nose cone.
