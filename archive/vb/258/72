Look at pages 267 (picture) and 273 (text) of the '67 parts manual at
http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5867part.html .  Stock, the right
tie rod wasn't adjustable and I don't know if the ends even came off of
it.  The left tie rod was adjustable, but note that the inner tie rod
end has left-hand threads.  I _think_ you can install an adjustable
tie-rod on the right as well, but still, one end will have left-hand
threads.
