I'm not sure that any 2 part paint is as good - maybe you are right - but -
I do think it would be rare to get any sprayed paint on as thickly as 2
coats of por-15 applied with a brush.  Maybe 2 part paint applied with a
brush would have a similar rust stopping effect as por-15.  If I remember
when I shot my roof with epoxy primer next weekend (at least I hope to) I'll
brush some epoxy primer on a rusty piece of floor that I have behind my
workshop and I'll do an adjacent portion with por 15 and .... test your
hypothesis (is that an hypothesis).
