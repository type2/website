Hadn't worked on the truck this week until today. I hit my wife up 
early for a helping hand to install the front windshields. The old 
ones were cracked and I had 2 non-cracked ones with bubbles at the 
bottom on another bus so I swiped 'em for this project. Jim Share in 
Abilene got my spare set a few months back....oh well.

I was able to use the old seals. They actually look like they were 
new when put on 4 years back or whatever it was. Not bad at all. I 
put 'em around the glass and left them in the sun for a while. When 
my help arrived I grabbed the glass with the seals on them and lubed 
'em lightly with some dishwashing soap, put my nylon string around 
the channel, added a little sealant (yes I know Eric & Barb...roofing 
tar, roofing tar, roofing tar), then put them in place. While my 
lovely and understanding wife put some pressure on the glass I worked 
the lip over the windshield frame. Worked great. Piece of cake. I did 
the other side exactly the same. A little push here and there from 
the outside to make sure they were seated and all was good. Took 
maybe 10 minutes to get 'em in at best. Can't believe how easy it was 
actually.

After that I decided to swap out the gas tank. The one in the truck 
is all rusty. The engine is actually running on a plastic gas tank in 
the engine compartment right now (real safe..huh). So I put my spare 
tank with a sending unit in there. I've got big bay tanks for all the 
other busses, so this one was actually bottom of the barrel. It was 
nice and clean enough so in it goes. Unfortunetly I've got to pick up 
the fitting for the bottom of the tank so I can hook up the fuel line 
from out at the ranch. Don't know how I ended up short on those guys. 
I might as well hit the hardware store and get a cut-off valve for 
this sucker while I'm here. All the reserve valve fittings I've got 
leak and I don't want to mess with them right now, so I'll just stick 
with this plan I think.

Believe it or not the truck would pass inspection right now. But I'm 
gonna do the right thing and get the gas tank taken care of before I 
go get it inspected and registered.

Other than that, it's cosmetics that are left. And with it being a 
Rat, not much of that stuff to do at all.

REMINDER TO SELF: If my buddy doesn't get my wide white wall tires he 
promised me real soon it'll be time to open up a can of whoop ass on 
him complements of Guiness Stout.

Computer geek...maybe. Rawdy Redneck Drunk....definitely.
