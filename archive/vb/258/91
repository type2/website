there is a switch.  either you have one in the nose cone (67 nose cone) which 
mean if you don't you have to remov ethe tranny to swap nose cones, major 
PITA.  But if you do pull the tranny you might keep in mind the reverse light 
switch nose cone.   That activates a switch when the bus is in reverse.   you run 
a wire from the coil 15 to an in line fuse to the reverse light switch on the 
tranny, then back and to the reverse lights.   I did this on my 61, thought I 
put a pic on the samba, not sure.  attached a 67 bug style reverse light to 
the bumper.

Or you can get the switch that goes between the speedo cable and the speedo.  
This means when you are moving backwards  the light goes on, but not when you 
are in reverse planning on backing.   I see these switches around the swaps 
for about $30 now and again.
