Subject: leaky carb

While going through the motor that came with the dc, I noticed there  
was a light mist of gas forming on bottom end of carb, and going about  
an inch down the manifold.  I tightened the nuts, wiped it off, and it  
seemed to stay dry.  After a couple of hours,  I started playing with  
the throttle, and noticed that as I pulled it down, gas immediately  
appeared on the surface of a small round "plug" directly in front of  
me, and on both sides of carb on the nuts at the end of the shaft that  
the throttle pivots on.  I let it sit overnight, and this morning, it  
was back to the light mist forming and spreading down the manifold,  
plug was dry, and bolts were dry. (until I rocked throttle again)

I've included a link to a couple of pic's I took, and a short movie(let  
me know if it works) of what happens when I pull down on the throttle.

Seems like there are multiple problems here, but I was wondering if  
they could be solved with a rebuild, or just try and replace it?  If I  
need to replace, what would be an available compatible carb?
