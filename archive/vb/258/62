Hi Diane,
Nice bus!!  Finding a good body shop for an old VW is a hard thing to do.  
Most only want work where they buy a new fender paint it to match and bolt it 
on!!  Are you going to have your bus painted what looks to be the original white 
over red?  We hope you have already gone through the steering, brake and 
suspension.  If it does not steer, stop or the wheels spin properly it can become 
an unguided missle way too fast.
