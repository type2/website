A big part of the expense for me is the fact that I already have 2
connections to the sewer; my house sits on a corner, and some rocket
scientist plumbed one bathroom to the street on one side and the
other to the other street.  I have to pay extra for a 3rd connection;
a 2nd wouldn't have incurred the fee.  As such, I also have to pay
$X/foot for them to tear up the street and run the line.
