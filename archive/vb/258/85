Subject: 67 Bus Project continued

Someone asked about brakes etc .. I complete replaced the brakes.  Master
cylinder and so on.  Emergency brake cable is broken, that needs to be fixed,
but the rest of the braking system is brand new.  Traded my 71 bus for a new
engine, so hopefully I will get many years from this bus.

As for paint.  Some people were urging me to go with the traditional paint
job, but I am NOT a traditional person.  Going with a pyschedelic paint job.
Going to primer it when the rear end is finished. It looks like someone tried
to pick it up with a fork lift and punched two holes on either side just below
where the bumper sits. I already have the curved panels for those areas.  But
the "body-guy-from-hell hasn't shown up to finish the job, and I am not giving
him a 3rd or 4th chance to show up.  I waited all day yesterday.

Guess that's about all .. hope to have more pictures when it is clean, new
seats, and of course, the paint job.

You are driving down the Highway of Life. . You spot another VW in the
opposite lane ...
As you pass, hands go up ... Eye contact is made and you both smile ...
VW's are more than just transportation ...
They're your soul, your inner peace ... and sometimes your worst nightmare!!
