Subject: RE: [VB] Westy Hitch VS. Eriba Puck

As former owner of a 1968 Puck I have the following comments.
We always used the 1 7/8" ball. In my case could not get the 2" to fit. If our
friend Ricky Fu is able to use that size then great. I was unable to.
It is agreed that 50mm is proper and recommend obtaining one if you have any
doubts in your mind. It is great doing business with Ronnie and am sure that
the price to be established for the item will be fair.
Good luck with the Pucks!

How hot in Phx? It's not the heat, but the action that matters...
