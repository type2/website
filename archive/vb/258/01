Subject: Anybody seen her?

Hi, I am new to the list. I am wondering if anyone out there knows the fate
of my old bus. Ha ha, you may be laughing, but she was quite unique, so I
will offer a short description: (sorry, no pics)

    1963 Kombi, Dove Blue
    German import with Euro lenses and Bumpers, and the "D" sticker on the
back.
    Ambulance fan AND Ambulance sliding-glass partition. Partition looked
like it was factory installed (if they did, I don't know)
    Possibly home-made or kit semi-camperized with fold-down benches, table
and cabinets in back, with small pop-up roof vent.
    Locking steering column ignition switch.
    Hmmm, what else..  foot pump window washer.
    Other details will bore, so enough.

    Regretably sold out of need in the Vancouver BC area in 1995.  I just
think it would be a kick to know if it was restored, and to see some pics.
(God forbid it was wrecked or parted).

    I am currently looking for a DC for resto / base vehicle for electric
conversion (good pun!). On a DC, has anyone successfully installed a
treasure chest door on the left side? Will need one for improved battery
access.

    Ben
    Pender Island, BC
