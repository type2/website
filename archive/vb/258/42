Subject: 67 tie rods

HI there again,
    Well, I went out and figured i'd get started on the tie rod ends. Got
the wheels off, pulled the cotter pin out, took off the nut, fired up the
torch, heated it up. Smacked it with a three pound brass mallett, popped
right off. YAY!!! loosened up the clamp on the tie rod side, squirted it
with WD-40, put the wrench to it. Nothing. Three more times....Nothing.
Fired up the torch again, heated it up.....tried to get it off....Nothing.
Part of the problem is everything is at a bad angle. So i figured i'll take
the whole thing off, so that I can really work on it. Have to do the torch
thing again to get the inner race loose from the steering arm, so even
though the joint was tight....I cooked the rubber. Oh, well, I guess I can
replace the inner ones also. So I get the whole tie rod off, take it in the
shop, stick it in the vise, ....AAARGGGGGGGHHHH!!!  Nothing. Holy S**T is
this thing on tight! Go back out and get the torch, heat it for 5 minutes,
nearly glowing....Put on welding gloves, vice grips.....UGHHHMMMMMMM!!!
Nothing. Dang!!! What is the deal with that? Is there another trick to
getting the tie rod end out of the tie rod tube? I hope I can just replace
the whole thing. Shouldn't have to though....I'm out of Ideas......
