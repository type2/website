Subject: RE: [VB] Westy Hitch VS. Eriba Puck

  On Ricky Fu's vehicles he has a 1 7/8 on his high roof and a 2" on his
other vehicle (currently towing his Eriba). They actually use a 50 mm ball
which is half way between the two. Ricky says it takes a little effort to
get the trailer off of the 2" ball but either will or should work (or maybe
the coupler on the trailer is a little warn out


ronnie

ps. I have 50mm european cast shank/ball recievers being sent over from
europe along with the trailer recievers for those wanting the european look.
Ordered them from the equivilent of NAPA in Antwerpt Belquim, even got a
shop discount!!!!!

My Westy hitch ball measures exactly 2.0 inches in dia. (with two coats of 
primer and three coats of paint)  So, I'm looking to purchase an Eriba and
the 
seller says his 2.0 in U.S. ball won't fit the Eribas hitch.  He uses a 1
7/8" 
U.S. hitch.  He also says the Eribas hitch is original European.  Is a U.S. 
ball bigger than two inches or is the receiver slightly smaller?  Does
someone 
out there who tows with a Westy hitch or a U.S. one know the answers?
Thanks,
