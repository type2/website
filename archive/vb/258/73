Subject: Re: [VB] undercoating ?

How about painting over undercoating?

I sandblasted to bare metal, primed with enamel, sprayed with undercoat,
primed again with epoxy and top coated with acrylic enamel. Think it will
ever rust again?

Go with the high content zinc primer.  Must be at least 85% zinc content or
you are wasting your $$$.  Without the zinc against the metal POR 15, and
any
other type paint will just cover spreading rust from any chips or scratches
in
the finish, and rubber, plastic undercoating do even worse becoming a
greenhouse for the rust as water works in.  Paint and then a thin coating of
roofing
tar, and apply chainsaw oil to places like inside lower nose, doglegs,
rockers,
lower doors, etc... after throughly washing out and let dry.  The stuff Stan
is talking about sounds interesting, but we do not know if it has the same
rust repelant action as tar.
