Don't know about you, but I always hot tank and clean up/restore sheet metal
and paint and store. Exhaust parts I get are usually over the hill and get
trashed. Nuts, washers and bolts that were replaced that are still serviceable
get tanked and cleaned and put in my used hardware assortment by size and
type. I usually replace all  bolts, nuts and washers with new ones and even
the long case bolts. Every now and then I will throw together an engine for
some purpose or another and then I will use my nice clean sheet metal and
stuff out of my stock.
