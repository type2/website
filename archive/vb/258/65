Subject: undercoating ?

Was writ:

"but the undercarriage is so nice and clean (rust wise).   yum.   pretty
grey paint (or is 

that primer?)   thinking about sanding the surface rust off and zinc
primering the outside.    It needs a paint job."

 

I have been contemplating this undercoating thing for a while now.i.e.
procrastinating. But I am wondering what the best method is.

 

a)rubber/tar type undercoating - I think this is bad, because any rust under
this coating will accelerate, and you will never see it

 

b)por-15 - supposedly very good, may require a lot of prep work, and a
little pricey

 

c)zinc primer-where can you get this would any FLAPS have this, I think I
read you need to find something that is like 95% zinc? I assume since it is
a primer, you need to top coat it

 

d)corroless 

 

e)chassis saver

 

f)bar and chain oil-I guess this has some acid in it to convert rust to
something or other, like naval jelly, then the oil keps the water away, down
side is when ever you go to work on  it, I imagine you get really dirty and
greasy, kind of a rust & maintenance deterrent.

 

 

Am I missing any options? I guess they all require some form of prep
work.but what do you do when if your whole underside is not rusty, most of
mine has surface rust, and I think a lot of these special paints will not
adhere to the areas that are not rusty without really a lot of sanding.

 

Anyone see why one is far superior to another-my bus basically has surface
rust on it, and I don't have access to a lift, so I will need to basically
jack the bus up, and probably just do one section at a time..

 

Appreciate the feedback.
