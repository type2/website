Geocel 2310.
Call me crazy but I have used this Geocel 2310 on undercoaring.
It is a clear polimer material that can be cleaned up with mineral
spirits.
It is a roof patch product.
After 20 years on the roof of a commercial metal building in blazing
Texas heat it never peeled, cracked or let go.
It showed some discoloration after about ten years.
When the building partially burned it reflowed and ran down the roof
(5/12 pitch) a couple of inches, but still didn't let the roof leak.
This stuff is about $26.00 a gallon from commercial roofing supply
houses.
It's one of the few products that my supplier set out in his showroom
area; They sell a lot of it.
I've never tried to burn or ignite this 2310 but it didn't burn on the
roof when the fiberglass skylights flamed and burned out.
If you use it for interior undercoating it is self leveling after a few
minutes and requires about 48 hours for a complete dry cycle.
