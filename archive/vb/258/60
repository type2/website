Subject: 67 Bus Project of my own

Been lurking here for some time.  Didn't want to post because my bus was so
far from being road ready.  But it is getting VERY close now.  A bumper and
tags and away we go.  I have a 71 bus right now that is going to a good home.
[ I hope ]   Wish I could take all the good karma etc with me into my new bus,
guess I will just have to make some more.  That last 2 times my bus broke
down, it was in my drive-way.

So, hi there everyone.  I am diane in Orlando.

diane [ that was redundant wasn't it ?
