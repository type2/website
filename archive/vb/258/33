I use a product called aircraft stripper, I'm not sure what the name of
the
manufacturer is. 
------------------------- Clip ------------------------
Get Strip Eze at an Auto Paint Supplier.
It is Called Aircraft Stripper.
Use it this way.
#1) Wear Gloves
#2) Wear Eye Protection
#3) Get up in the middle of the night when it is very cool and paint /
brush on a coat of the stripper.
#4) Mask off anything you don't want stripped, pitted.
This will strip paint in about 15 minutes.
Keep a water hose handy in case you need to flush off your arms, wash out
your eyes, wash off your hands and wash your gloves and brush after
you've finished.
Just take a scraper and drag it lightly across the paint after it dries
and wrinkles.
Does a really good job, about $10.00 a quart.
A quart will strip about 50 square feet.
Good luck, and don't breathe the fumes ................ Hot Stuff.
