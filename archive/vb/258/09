Subject: Friday: Buses in Charlie's Angels 2

I'm not sure if anyone else posted this earlier, but Amber & I saw CA2 last 
weekend and in the beach scene..."the" beach scene, ya know...Cameron Diaz, 
Demi Moore, bikinis, surfing, yeah <nods>...Demi's character leaves in 
(what I think is) a Lamborghini and there's a wide shot of the parking lot 
as she shoots down between the cars.  Lower right corner of the frame, 
there's a lowered green & white double cab in the foreground.  Is that 
anyone's?  It kinda looks like Tony Christina's but I'm not 
certain.   Later, when Cameron's character is talking to the assassin dude 
(whose driving a late 60s Camaro?), they're standing right next to a real 
nice red & white 21-Window!  Anyone's?

"Listen to the motor. Listen to the wheels. Listen with your ears and with 
your hands on the steering wheel; listen with the palm of your hand on the 
gear-shift lever; listen with your feet on the floor boards. Listen to the 
pounding old jalopy with all your senses; for a change of tone, a variation 
of rhythm..." - John Steinbeck _The Grapes of Wrath_
