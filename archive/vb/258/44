Subject: Broken tank stud on truck

I need to replace one of the fuel tank strap studs, the stud that sticks up and the tank strap
slides onto and then the nut/washer, anyone ever do this? Is it threaded in or is welded to the tank
saddle piece? The parts manual is calling this out as a hex bolt but i assume that is for normal
bus?
Thanks for any insight
