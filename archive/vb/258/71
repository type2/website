Hi Kevin,
Duh!  Forgot to mention that when we last bought the high zinc primer a 
couple of years ago from NAPA,  ordered a full case to get 10% off the normal 
price.  Biggest problem with this primer is the zinc settles quickly and sprays 
like mud if you do not go out about two days before using this primer and turn 
the cans over a couple of times a day and start shaking the cans you are going 
to use a couple of times the day before usage.  Everytime we go out to our 
storage shed with this primer in it we flip over the box to keep the primer 
stirred a bit each time.
