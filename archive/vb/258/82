		I actually bought a pair of those "Mechanix gloves" and they
are super!

		I might have said this before, but do consider getting a box
of latex gloves. 
		  It is really nice to just peel off the gloves and not have
oil/scum on my 
		hands.   For the greasey jobs like a suspension lube I use
the nitrile (blue) 
		gloves, as the latex gets soft and falls apart when all
covered with grease.  
		Also nitile ones are good against solvents, like when
cleaning a carb.   I 
		found nitrile gloves for $5 a box of 100 at Harbor Freight,
and they are fine for 
		people with latex allergies.
