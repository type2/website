Subject: Re: [VB] 67 Bus Project of my own

Wow, lookls like quite the project also.....One thing that I did notice is
that your bus has back up lights....Mine is a 67 also, but i have no back up
lights. I looked in there and it looks like there never was any . Different
models?
your pictures came out pretty good for a palm camera...I'm going to talk to
my web page guy and get a link added to my page so I can have Bus pictures
also!
Godd luck on your project. I want to see more as you go!!
Regards, Jason
