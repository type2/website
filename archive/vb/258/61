Gosh.  They know me by name now...I better go hide.  :)

I couldn't be nearly as helpful with electrical questions if it wasn't
for Thom's collection of color wiring diagrams.  For those of you just
tuning in, that's at http://vintagebus.com/wiring/ .

The other day, I found a good write-up on understanding VW electrics
by Jason Hamilton.  If your eyes glaze over at the maze of wires on the
diagram, you should read it: http://www.type-14.com/electrical.htm .
It's based on a '69 Ghia diagram, but the same principles apply to
Buses, Bugs, etc.
