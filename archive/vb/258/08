Best reason I know to have a septic system.

Why don't you tell the county to take a hike and put in a septic tank for
the shop?

Damn!  As far as I can tell from reading the local laws, getting the
permit for a sewer hookup in Tulsa will only cost you $50 or so.  I guess
you could spend the other $4050 on a really nice Crapper...

I think you should do your best to make sure that you get $4100 of use
out of your sewer.  Invite all your friends to frequent chili cookouts
at your garage and serve Ex-Lax brownies for dessert.  Skip a couple of
trips to the recycling center for your used Bus fluids.  Stuff like that.

Fun fact: at $3/40# bag, $4100 is around 28 Bus-loads (55,000 lbs) of
cow manure...
