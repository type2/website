When you ever end up with extra pieces, especially DORN, Kamax, Rasche,
bolts, nuts, washers, etc etc etc... box them up and send them to:

David Mayes
807 Penn Ave
La Grande OR 97850

When they arrive, they will be lovingly cleaned, wire wheeled, and
placed in an appropriate container along with like sizes.  And then
someday USED :-)
