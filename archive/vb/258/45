Subject: Westy Hitch VS. Eriba Puck

My Westy hitch ball measures exactly 2.0 inches in dia. (with two coats of 
primer and three coats of paint)  So, I'm looking to purchase an Eriba and the 
seller says his 2.0 in U.S. ball won't fit the Eribas hitch.  He uses a 1 7/8" 
U.S. hitch.  He also says the Eribas hitch is original European.  Is a U.S. 
ball bigger than two inches or is the receiver slightly smaller?  Does someone 
out there who tows with a Westy hitch or a U.S. one know the answers?
Thanks,
Arthur
