Subject: Re: [VB] headliner ...

John,

I can tell you that the original ash plywood headliner in my Kamper Kits is 
in 2 pieces. A left and a right. Cut from 4x8' x3/16"?? thick material. 
There is about a 6" wide piece that goes up the center that ties them 
together. Installation is one piece at a time and screwed into the stringers 
that go across the roof. Driver side, passenger side and then the strip up 
the middle. After that all the rest of the Kamper pieces go in. The ply is 
fairly flexible because it so thin so it conforms pretty well to the roof 
curve.

Can anyone tell me the trick to making a headliner out of Baltic Birch . I
have pieces that go in the cab ..and I have stuff for around the pop-top
(non-westy style) . but I can't seem to get the  5 x 5 piece (cut down to
54" I think) in . I broke two . damn it!
