Subject: Overheating distributor

Ever heard of an overheating distributor ?  I went out camping a few 
weeks ago and when I arrived at the site the engine died.  I had a look 
around and turning the engine over after a while gave a petrol smell so 
I knew that gas was getting through.

When I felt the engine it was not unusually hot and I could touch the 
case and dipstick no problem, but the distributor was too hot in my 
opinion.  Since I have Compufire transistor points I figured they had 
thermally cut out.  I put a damp cloth on the distributor body to take a 
little of the head away then after 10 minutes or so I tried it again and 
it fired up no problem.

Setup is a stock 1600 with a SVDA from 
http://www.aircooled.net/new-bin/viewproductdetail.php?keyword2=IGD0001 
installed a few years ago with no problems.

Any thoughts on my I would get a hot distributor ?

thanks

Lee
