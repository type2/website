Get the front roof panels in first.
Wait, have you got good directional flaps in your fresha ir vent?   You cannot
get to the upper screw for eth directional mechanism (to send teh air to teh
sides or teh back, that knob on teh air vent you know)  once the roof panels
are in.

After the panels over the front seat are in, work on the big camepr area
panels.
get one side in,
then (this is the tricky part) bend the middle of the panel down, so the panel
is an M
Then slide the other side in from above.

Now you have an M with both edges in place.  :)
next pop the middle of the M up so it's an upside down U.   :)
Then you may have to shift the panels forward or back before screwing in the
trim strips.

Easier with two people than by yourself.
