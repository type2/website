Subject: pics of my '65 & sound stuff

Well I am kind of figuring this picasa thing out. I've posted some random
pics of my bus undergoing it's restoration.

 

The last few show the final paint job, and the sound proofing I'm currently
installing. I am using Damplifier and luzury liner pro. I have just
installed a bunch of Damplifier, but am not done with that yet. The bus
sounds much nicer when you thump any panel on it-it sounds real solid now.
