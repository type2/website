HI Busbaby,
Are you using a mechanical fuel pump???

If so...
Did you measure the highest point the fuel pump rod comes out of the
fuel pump base as you turn the engine by hand????  If so how high????

Which fuel pump are you using?????   Is it the one that the lever the
push rod pushes against up inside the fuel pump or even with the base???

If pump rod comes up a bit too high fuel pressure will be so high that
shut off float and the shut off valve will be pushed open, pouring fuel
into the manifold.
   Using the long version of fuel pump push rod with pump with lever
even with base of the pump (requires shorter version of push rod) will
result in too much fuel pressure and all too soon broken fuel pump!!

If all the above is correctly setup.
   Could be your shut off float in the carb is cracked, or just too
heavy, so not shutting off the valve above.
  Sticking or bad shut off float, OR you are missing the gasket for it.
  Missing, loose or incorrect jets in the carb.
  Crack in the carb float chamber.
  Choke not opening.

Can also be your gas cap is not vented so fuel tank is getting
pressurized when gas in tank gets warm, but after a while the tank will
get a vacuum when engine
running for long periods, and gas tank will crack from flexing in/out.
