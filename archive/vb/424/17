Subject: Re: [VB] Freeway Flyer tranny

A Freeway Flyer is higher gearing installed in your swing axle tranny.
This can be a higher 4th gear, or a taller r&p.
If you get too high gearing the engine will seem wimpy, especially if you tend
to carry heavy loads.
There are a number of options for higher gears, so "Freeway Flyer" does not
actually say which it is.
But if you are running a 1600 the stock for 59 gearing is designed for a
1200cc motor.
That gearing is lower than would have come with a 1500 motor in a split bus,
and you have room for taller gears and still have decent oomph.

I supposed the one ton 63 tranny in my 56 westy is a freeway flyer, as it is
taller geared than what the 56 came with.
  The PO installed it in the seventies so he could go faster.  It is a good
match for a 1600, the gearing was designed for a 1500 bus.

You might just want to swap to big nut boxes from small nut and leave the
center section alone if yours works fine.
Is your 59 SC an early 59/ currently splitcase tranny?
