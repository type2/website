Subject: ISO a picture of a Porsche 356 and Early Bus photo

Volks--

I'm formatting an article by Dan Proudfoot on the
origin of the Bus--and we're looking for a photo
of an early Bus beside and Porsche 356, front view.

I searched on the intertoobs, but only came up
with pictures of either one separately, never side-by-side.

The article shows evidence of how the two
vehicles are tied together--something of a "lost history."

Any help is appreciated and will be recognized.

Got a VW Bus Story you'd like to share?
Do you know someone else who does?

A collection of stories of life and adventure
with the VW Bus is coming together! Were looking
for tales of travel adventure; tidbits of daily
life with a VW Bus; memories of your first
sighting of a Bus; the first Bus you ever owned;
weddings and celebrations where VW Buses held a
prominent position; stories of Bus enthusiasm
passed down from generation to
generation-anything related to the glories (and
predicaments) of VW Busing. Photos and artwork are welcome.

If you have material you'd like to contribute, or
for more information, please contact Tom
