Subject: driven home...

Well I finally got to drive my '65 kombi home two days ago!

 

I want to send out a thanks to all of you, for your help while trying to get
this thing done, your insight into parts, how to put things together, and
how to properly install gaskets, have been very helpful. Whenever I heard
trip reports, I missed driving mine. Now that the weather is great, my wife
is anxious to take it camping again this summer. I plan on a few trips with
it in-complete.until I can get it really complete. A lot of the work left is
wood working(which is what I love to do, and have the proper tools for).

 

I've still got a ways to go, but it is home, and I can work at my house.
This alone should save me some time-before I had to  do a lot of driving
back and forth to the body shop, and try to get there when he was available.

 

Time to start building the interior.

 

I will soon post some pics on thesamba of the end product.
