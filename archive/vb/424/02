Subject: '63 bug needing a good home

So I have this friend down Austin, Tx way...

He has a '63 bug that's been a member of his family for a whole lotta  
years. Lately he's been simplifying his his life and he's determined  
that it's time for Gertrude to go to a new owner.  Beebs, the owner,  
put together a little presentation to share his and Gertrude's story.   
If you're interested in reviving a bug that looks from here to be  
eminently revivable, please take a look at the webpage and drop Beebs  
a line.  (I could put this on The Samba, but I just think that the  
lists are a more likely forum for locating the kind of person that  
will be allowed to adopt, ya know?)
