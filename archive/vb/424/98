Right. It gives kind of that virgin from the factory look you hate to
lose. I thought of just running bare metal for aesthetics, but after
reading this thread I am thinking noise suppression is more important.
Still, it's a bit scary for me too as I hate to apply anything that
years down the road when the adhesive dries up, separates, and becomes
a moisture trap.
