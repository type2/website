That damplifier stuff is dangerous...I put it in, and used a roller, but on
one edge I ran my finger to smooth it out. The aluminum facing gave me a
nasty slice.

I was planning on using the luxury liner pro over the damplifier, but not
sure where yet. I have the Damplifier on most of the walls and the roof. I'm
trying to decide how I am going to do the engine compartment. This is where
a lot of engine noise comes from, but it is also exposed - ie seen, whereas
all the other stuff will be hidden behind panels. 

I guess the main floor area will be covered, so that will get the
damplifier...also the floor in the front cab... I don't think the damplifier
would be good there. But maybe I can put it underneath the bus, as this will
be protected by the pedal pan. Ie unseen, and hopefully unheard. They
recommend to install on the wheel well areas, to take away road noise. I
think I can put it under the matts that go on the front wheel wells, not
sure about the back ones.

I  got a couple pieces up in the nose too. I think I'll try to get more up
there too.

My goal to have a real quiet bus. I also have a bunch of that foil bubble
wrap stuff, that acts as insulation. I would like to get some of this in,
although I may be running out of room! I'll try to document and photo
everything real well.

Hey Kevin,

Pretty cool to see the before and after transformation.
I used Dynamat Extreme and put it into the same places. I also filled the 
voids with 2 layers of the NASA insulation. The walls now all thump instead 
of clang when you knock on them.
