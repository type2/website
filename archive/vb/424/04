Now I never loved the stained glass vanagon myself, though I've spent a lot of
time under it, but get what Steve has here folks.  This is a BRAND NEW
rebuild, admittedly an AVP, but still, what is that now $1500 or more?  It is
as good as anyones stock rebuild, and unless he's changed em out, also damn
near new set of Agillis on it I bet.  That folks is over $2000 in shit sitting
there, and I bet Steve doesn't want much for it.  Plus it all used to work,
full Vanagon camper interior, admittedly a very, very early one.
 
Anyway ugly as hell or not, this Vanagon was running solidly before Steve
started having some issues so he couldn't fix it, and it could be again, for I
bet a lot less than his conjectured $1000.  Or it is a parts trove.
