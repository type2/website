Subject: RE: [VB] clutch ... what do i need? 

One more thing ...my engine is from a 71 bus (bus is a 60) .... I notice
71's had a one year only cutch kit ... why? Maybe I'd need that clutch kit?
The fly wheel is (as I've said) a 12 volt flywheel with 6 volt gears. Would
I need the earlier throwout bearing? 

I'm thinking I need this throwout bearing:
