Subject: accelerator cable nut

Was installing the engine today and turned the nut a bit too tight, it
broke right at the end, so it is holding, but will have to remove it
somehow. Drilling it will be a pain as it is so small and at a bad
angle.

Any ideas? I was thinking dremmel tool and cut top and bottom to free
the cable end.
