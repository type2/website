I picked up this old radio and I'm guessing its 50's .  I think it is short
wave, fm, am - it is meant to be mounted in a car but it also operates on
batteries such that you can pull it out of the mount and take it to your
picnic with your favourite frauline . I've been told that there is a link
for vintage german/ Austrian radios . anyone have it?
