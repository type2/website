Subject: Re: [VB] What is your diagnosis?

I took it apart last night. It turns out the early bay clutch pressure
plate has a collar in the center. This collar is what what was
shattered in there. The clutch disc plate actually looks ok.

Also, my local flaps says they have all these parts. We will see.
