Subject: Fw: [T2] Re: [VB] Freeway Flyer tranny

Sorry sent to wrong list.


The answer to the do it yourself question is, it can be done, however its
quite a bit of work.  You may want to pull the trans to do it. I've done it.
Put the vehicle on jack stands, good ones. Have a hydraulic floor jack. Pull
engine, pull trans. Now you need to remove the axles. The trick is to be
able to remove the big snap rings once you get the side plates off.

If you have a split case trans, I'm not sure if the newer axles will fit.
Others can answer that one.

Regards,
Chris




Is this something an average Joe could do or would a transmission shop need
to do it??  I do have a 1600 and small nut tranny.  I was thinking about
building a big bore motor over the winter.  Hate to replace anything as long
as everything works, however.  I don't do a whole lot of freeway driving
(the wife refuses to go fast in the old single cab!) but I have heard good
accounts of the better transmission.
