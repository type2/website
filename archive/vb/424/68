In the US we switched to a new "standardized" VIN for the 1981 model year. 
Prior to that, it's pretty hodgepodge, and difficult, if not impossible, 
to parse.


I dont know of anyone who deals with records for cars prior to 
1981....there may have been some electronicly-accessable-data rules 
kicking in starting around that time that make these services possible, 
perhaps...
