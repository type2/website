This year is shaping up to be a spectacular year with some spectacular live
music. Below is a list of some of the artists that will be performing at
this year's event. 

*	Live music from several artists playing their blend of roots rock,
folk, bluegrass, jam and singer song writer genres. As in years past we
showcases some fine home grown Michigan music. There is a lot of great music
coming out of our state in recent years and it is nice to have an
opportunity to share their music with others from other parts of the
country. Performing this year will be:
