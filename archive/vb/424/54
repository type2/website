Perhaps your WHITE should go to the IGNITION, Then you can have TACH light
when you have your IGNITION on, even if you do not use your bus LIGHTS..


Of course, if you need to see your TACH when the engine isn't running, you
could go WHITE to LIGHTS.


I have an electronic TACH / CLOCK that SHOULD fit into the ASH TRAY
opening.  I just have to 'square the corners' of the ash tray opening - I
plan to incise the four corners with a hack saw blade, and square the
corners with a BFH and chisel.  [Sorry, a B*M*FH -> 3 lb]   The ash tray
will still be able to be replaced without concern.

I have a wire for constant voltage which is needed for my electronic CLOCK.
Another wire goes to the IGNITION so the LEDs light up when I turn the key
on.

Now I am asking, in your case, just what do you need the RED wire for?

Oh, in my previous '78 VW bus, I pulled a single wire from the coil to my
glove compartment.  Then I set a partner ground wire from the front firewall
to my glove compartment.  With this, I could use my digital multimeter to
either read the RPM, or switch the digital multimeter to read the DWELL. (No
clock, darn it...)

It has been so long since I had a VW bus running that I will have to check
which coil terminal to use to check DWELL and RPM.  Of course, if I pick the
wrong terminal, the testing wire seems to melt real fast!!
