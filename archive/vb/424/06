Subject: re:vent window rivet & window sealing

Thanks for all the suggestions.I decided to go with the ball bearing and the
vise-grips. While trying to find a ball bearing at the hardware store, I
came across some acorn nuts. I thought these would be perfect, as the flat
side would not roll on the vice-grips. Dang, I thought I had come up with
something great! Then I tried it, and the acorn nut just crumpled.

 

So ball bearing it was. It was hard to get the ball bearing to crush the
rivet evenly, and the rivet kind of smooshed more on one side. Anyway I got
them in, and noticed the latch on one was loose, then the other latch broke!
Dang pot-metal, so after reading in the archives.it seems like the best
thing is to get new windows with the hardware already installed. I don't see
how you possibly get the glass out of the window frame, to be able to
install the latch.

 

When I redo it, I may try the c-clamp instead of vice grip.

 

One question about these windows. My old ones never shut great, and there
was always a bit of a whistle while on the highway-which was only cured by
opening the window.  When I got my new wing windows in, I noticed a pretty
big gap between the glass and the seal. 

 

I saw some suggestions on how to cure this by using silicone on the edge of
the glass. I was wondering if there is a better way. I mean, they must have
sealed well originally, right?
