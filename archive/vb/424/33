Subject: new spare tire for my bus....

Have you guys seen this new thing by VW? It is an electric bike, that is
supposed to fold up and fit where you would store your spare tire in a
modern vehicle(ie the trunk or boot). I think this would be pretty cool
instead of mounting the spare tire on the front of your bus.
