Hi E&B,

Can you explain what you mean by fix or shim the wear on the lower pivot
shaft? I am talking about my '65. I don't see any wear?

I am leaning towards putting an extra seal on the glass.

Hi Kevin,
Best way would be to fix or shim the wear on the lower pivot shaft of 
those.
   We have taken household door foam rubber seal tape, and after cutting 
it down with scissors taped it on the glass where the rear seal is 
supposed to seal against the glass.  Most volks never see it, works 
well, and easy to replace without all the mess of silicon sealant.

Yes a C-clamp would apply straight pressure, where vise grip will shove 
to one side.
