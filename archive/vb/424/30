I've done this a couple times--be aware that the aluminum is rather 
soft. Try to not actually touch it with whatever tool you'll be 
using: finger nail, popsicle stick, or crowbar (just kidding on that 
last one). The aluminum trim will mar very easily.

Yes, a warm day helps with the plastic being pliable.

I also remember that the plastic shrank after I put it in--leaving 
gaps at the ends! Maybe the newer reproduction belt beading is better 
than what I used 20 years ago.

Other folks may have other suggestions, I'm guessing.
