Subject: RE: [VB] deluxe molding insert

Very meticulous use of your fingers...I also used a small plastic trim
tool and it helped to have the rubber insert heated up, either by
sticking it in hot water or letting it sit out in the sun. Just be
careful because it will shrink up.
Good luck.

What is the easiest way to insert the vinyl strip into the chrome body
molding on a deluxe bus? I couldn't find a reference on the "list"/ T
