Subject: type2.com server move

We are in the process of moving and the type2.com server will be moving as
well. We are a couple weeks out at this point, and will send out another
message before it actually takes place. Expected down time will be about a
half at most, and it will remain under the same hosting scenario has it has
been for the past couple years. DNS propagation will take longer than the
physical move.  More later.

Peace, Troy
