Subject: Re: [VB] re:vent window rivet & window sealing

Hi Kevin,

I have the whistling wings too. The current available seals are just not 
right. I did discover that the whistle is from the straight, vertical piece 
at the trailing edge of the window. The 2 ribs don't make good contact with 
the glass. I found that glueing  a narrow strip of rubber that sticks up a 
little between the 2 ribs to contact the window can solve the problem. I 
happen to have some rubber sheeting here that works OK, but not great. You 
might try some thing else, like stick on foam rubber.

One question about these windows. My old ones never shut great, and there
was always a bit of a whistle while on the highway-which was only cured by
opening the window.  When I got my new wing windows in, I noticed a pretty
big gap between the glass and the seal.

I saw some suggestions on how to cure this by using silicone on the edge of
the glass. I was wondering if there is a better way. I mean, they must have
sealed well originally, right?
