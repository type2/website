Subject: Re: 1600 rebuild ...

I've got an engine rebuild/build sheet on my website that is down  
loadable in MS Excel format that may help.  It also doubles as an  
engine build spec sheet which can come in handy if you sell the  
vehicle/motor or have to do work on it years later as a memory  
refresher.

Hope this helps. . .  Good Luck!!
