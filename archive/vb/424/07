Subject: Re: [VB] clutch ... what do i need?

Pressure plate and thowout bearing must match the transmission.   The  
major difference is if you have a sleeve around the input shaft (late)  
or not (early)

Assuming your flywheel is cut for the 200mm disc you just want a  
regular early (70 back) 200mm kit.

Only if your transmission has a sleeve around the input shaft should  
you use a late t/o bearing and matching pressure plate.
