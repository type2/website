Subject: Re: [VB] Freeway Flyer tranny

Hi,

There are several flavors on the freeway flier. I chose to have a 3.88 r&p 
installed to replace the 4.125. You DO want to have a slightly larger engine 
to push the higher gears. I have a 1776.

In your case, if you have a 59 with a stock small nut trannee, a 3.88 with a 
1600 would work. The 3.88 is 6% higher ratio so you can go 6% faster in each 
gear. Let's see. 60 times 1.06 equals 63.6mph.

You may want to go for big nut reduction gear boxes. I used to drive 70 all 
day with a stock trans and big nut rgb's and a dual port 1600. I do get 
better gas mileage with my fwy flier and 1776.

I've heard many people discuss this and I am unsure exactly what it is.

Is it a IRS tranny fit to a old bus??  If so, how much work is it to do?

Someone suggested one to me for my '59 single cab and I am curious about it.
