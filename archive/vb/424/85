Subject: 1600 rebuild ... 

I'm starting to put together the things I'll need to rebuilt my 1600 . or
even build a spare .. Anyone know where I can find a list of what I need?
Re: P and C's . what size should I be looking for to build a 1600 sp .. And
what manufacturer is best or who should be avoided.
