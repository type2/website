That contraption might come in handy if you were expecting a breakdown from causes **other** than a flat tire, and you were also expecting to be somewhere out of cellphone range, and might need a ride to find a phone/mechanic.  Although, there are stretches of Route 50 between Fallon and Ely that I still wouldn't want to get stuck with an electric scooter of limited range!

Have you guys seen this new thing by VW? It is an electric bike, that is supposed to fold up and fit where you would store your spare tire in a modern vehicle(ie the trunk or boot). I think this would be pretty cool instead of mounting the spare tire on the front of your bus.
