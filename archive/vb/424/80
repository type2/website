No, but not having the right plug in stock, I was sold a compatible
NGK. At first I was happy because it had the narrower socket size so
it wouldn't interfere with my CHT sensor as bad, but when I went to
unscrew the standard plug top so I could use AC VW wires with it, it
broke off! It wasn't threaded on, it was permanent!

So I took the rest back and got the BP5 or 6 ES instead.

Bosch used to be the recommended plug, but if you check the list
archives, it appears that since going to global manufacturing the plug
quality has really come down in some of these countries. I don't know
if the country of manufacture is on the box somewhere.

So it seems NGK is the best quality available at the moment.
