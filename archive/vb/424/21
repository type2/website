My experience here was I think the simplest route for my 57 bus whilst 
retaining a stock look.  I junked the split case trans (with alpine 
ratio r.boxes) as I could just about manage 47mph with the 1200 motor.

I read the book to get the best ratios and sourced a 1200 bus box 
(highest r&p as I recall) and fitted later big nut '66/'67 r.boxes (best 
r.box rations).  This overall gives a final ratio slightly better than a 
1500 '66/'67 stock setup. I'm runing a stock 1600 DP so no worries and 
can cruise at 65 for just over 3K revs.  Main thing is that I wanted to 
keep stock height and r.boxes for the original look.  I have the big nut 
brakes on the back so had to fiddle with the lengths of the handbrake 
cables and I've fitted the CSP bolt on disc brake kit (wide five) up front.

I had to get an adapter plate to mount the tunnel trans in place without 
hacking off the split case mount incase the next owner wanted to put it 
all back.  I've been running that setup for a few years now
