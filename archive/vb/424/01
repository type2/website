Well, since the flywheel is not stock, it really depends on what they
made for you.

Don't the transmission input shafts have the same splines on all
versions? I don't know, but I've never seen a different size clutch
centering tool.

So that would make the flywheel alone the sole determinant as to what
clutch kit you need, both in terms of the disc diameter and bolt
pattern for the pressure plate.

Best to pull the motor and see what you have and match it. Or is this
for a fresh build? Then just measure your flywheel's disc surface
diameter and pressure plate bolt drillings.

Throwout bearing, of course, would fit your transmission if you are
buying that too.

 tell me what I need. I have a 1600 . with a  12 volt flywheel with 6 volt
 gears (I think)  . I had it made by rimco to fit my 6 volt transmission and
 1600 engine . so, what size clutch kit do I need?
