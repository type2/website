I was going to put a full Collins stack in my Bus, flight computer,
glass cockpit, dual ARINC-429 buses, the works.  Then I found out
I'd have to upgrade the Bus to 28 volt.  If the wind gets real bad,
an HSI might help.  But the thing I reallly want is TCAS with
moron prox (kinda like ground prox, but different -- helps avoid
those ugly CFISUV incidents).

There is a Bus in a junkyard near Tulsa that was apparently owned
by a pilot or aircraft mechanic; it has all kinds of placards that
belong in an aircraft stuck on the dash, air vent, etc.
