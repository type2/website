Subject: RE: [VB] Engine Break In

Well, I'll throw in my two cents since I have been rebuilding engines for
twenty five years and have had only two brought back in all that time, both
for defective components.

I generally run my engines for two or three hundred miles with standard
non-detergent oil, pull it, retorque, and put in 30 weight detergent oil for
the rest of its life. Depending on the application, I can usually get a
reliable 65 to 80K out of them, but I make them work for it. My old 65 DC
hauled garbage, gravel, trees, you name it. My 71 West failure took us
camping all summer long every year and not on the paved roads either! My
current project 67 SC hauls as much or more than the 65 DC and I hardly ever
give it a rest since it is my daily driver. But, as with all my motors, I
pulled it around 400, retorqued, and run 30 weight detergent. It runs what I
would consider normal temperatures, but I don't have a gage on anything, I
know what a hot motor feels and smells like!

Good luck

After a long hiatus our 63 Panel is nearly ready to go.  8-years it has 
languished: garaged in Winter, driveway in summer... my son has redone the 
entire underside in corrosion protection, new electrical, rebuilt trans and 
redux boxes, pedal assemblies, brakes, hoses... a long row to hoe.

So now, it is time to break in the engine... we have "heard" stories of 
different weight oils to help with the break in period... and now it is time

to hear from the list.  What weight oil and why?  We are going to go with 
Gene Bergs recommendation to go 200 miles and then pull to  retorque but 
some have "commented" lighter oil for break in others not.  Constructive 
opinions plz... Clara if you could, Ronnie? Thom?  I respect many of you out

there so make your opinion known and remember to say why... just an oil 
weight is not going to cut it.  Blame it on my son the Machinist... sigh.

This list is killer... don't know if there are any Willie N fans out there 
but remember the tune... "On the road again"?
