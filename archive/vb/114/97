hi bus listers, I thought my dad would like the B-52 comment and this is
what he said in the message below.
Bus content:
A. I like my sunroof bus 21% more than my hardtops
B. I saw a non barn 55 panel sell for only $200 at the Ennis bug in

From Dad:
To my knowledgeable VW Son,
I understand what they are talking about and they are not quite right. A
B-52 pilot and other military flight crew members  would know that you
need an opening to use the sextant to shoot the stars, as Dhube, Altair,
Vegas and others. However, the B-52 pilot would not know what end is up
with the sextant.

The Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) is / was in my days the one who used
the sextant. The Radar Operator and Navigator were suppose to know also,
but with 3,500 hours in a B-52 E/F and G models as a B-52 EWO/ Raven, I
never saw any of them pick up the sextant. My B-52 G hours would include
some combat hours high over Vietnam and Cambodia from Guam. Conversly the
B-52 pilot knew things that other crewmembers did not, I am not just
picking on the pilot as I can figure the drift also.

You can quote me as an expert on this B-52/ VW statement.
I know about B-52 and you have taught me about VW with a sunroof.

Question for your pilot friends, does any one use a E6-B computer (A
circular slide rule of sorts) anymore? Why would anyone want to use one,
other than beginning flight lessons?  
DAD.

Enquiring minds want to know:  Do you have a sunroof deluxe?  And if so,
do you drive with the sunroof open for your passenger to take readings
with a sextant?  If there are any B-52 pilots on this list they will
understand.  B^)
