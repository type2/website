Subject: Brake pedal and BN4

Is there anyone out there who knows how to fix this?
My brake pedal is real sloppy. I have regreased it,
installed a new spring and it still isn't too great.
Can these wear out? Can a new sleeve or bushing be put
in or are they even available?
Secondly, Is there anyone out there who has an old (67
earlier BN4? All I really need is the stand; the part
that mounts to the body and supports the heater, The
rest I don't need.

Thanks,
Sean
65 Westfalia
