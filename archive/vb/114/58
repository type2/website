Subject: 58 deluxe up for auction in MN


         Hello. I have been reading this list online for 3 years, but 
haven't joined until today. I am friends with several listmembers, and have 
3 split buses, between the wife and I.
         The reason for my post is that the 1958 15 window bus advertised 
on Everett's site and up for auction is not described accurately, and I 
wanted anyone who is considering bidding on it to have accurate 
information. The seller does not mention the rust holes in the passenger 
rear corner, both rockers and cab floor, passenger side collision damage, 
pushed in rear hatch, several broken windows including hatch and atleast 1 
corner, lack of headliner, or that it does not run. It turns my stomach to 
think about buying that bus expecting it to match the seller's description. 
I have emailed the seller, too, asking that he be honest and include the 
problems the bus has in his description. All 3 seats are very nice, as is 
the nose, and it still has the pedal pan. If you are considering it, please 
ask the seller as many questions as you have, or pmail me and I can give 
you some info and pictures of the bus that I took last weekend. Billy in
