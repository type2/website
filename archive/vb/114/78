From September 1961, which would be a 1962 model.

M 222.

No idea.

The M-code listing I have says M 222 was only available on models
211, 213, and 214, which are all panel vans.  I don't think you
could get a high-roof with regular Bus side windows in the back.
The '67 parts manual at the doc project backs this up:

>5) How hard is it to find ambulance innards? (Besides "Very VERY".)

I get the impression that the ambulance package was not sold much,
if at all, outside Europe.  So I don't think there'd be many innards
floating around in the US.
