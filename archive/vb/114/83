I don't bother to plug the tubes up- I figure some gas is going to spill out 
of the filter anyway.   Also, gas should not pour out, just a little bit.  I 
am assuming your filter is between the furl pump and the carb, right?  Gas 
should not flow through the gas pump under gravity pressure.   If it does 
spill more than what in the lines, I mean if it keep pouring out of that line 
from the pump, you need a new fuel pump.  If your filter is before the fuel 
pump, you do need to clamp the line in, or the gas tank will drain all over 
the place. 
Use hose clamps everywhere downstream of the fuel pump, everywhere the lines 
are under pressure that is.
if your fuel line ends look cracked, think about getting enough new German 
5mm fuel line (the american stuff is the wrong size) the do the whole bus - 
including from the gas tank to the engine I think it takes about three feet 
(?). 

 only you can prevent VW engine fires.
