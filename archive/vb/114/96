>it is time to break in the engine<

Big fun!  

Alright first put in 30 non-detergent and run it at ~ 2,000 RPM for 15-20
minutes to let the cam setup, get it warm, and run all the assembly lube
out.  Now drain the oil and visually inspect the valve train for odd things
(you cannot adjust them on a hot engine, if they are out wait till it cools
down to a cold status).  Check the drain plate for debris and other unhappy
stuff, if metal exists there then a bearing is rubbing and time to rebuild
it again.  Seal the thing back up and put in HD30.  Drive for 400-500 miles.
Change oil to HD 30 or 20-50 (your choice on what you like to run), torque
heads, and adjust/check valves.  Now flog it however you like :)

  
Good Luck,
