Subject: RE: [VB] DC rear seats

The 59 dc (may 19) has a pedestal with the dip in it...  It is nothing more
than a bent piece of metal... i.e. no extra pipes, tubes, or other bits
bolted or welded.

Everett asked:

How many styles of Double Cab rear seats are there?

I thought 3:
1. Binz
2. 59-65 - seat stand has a dip in it
3. 66-67 - flat seat stand

But someone mentioned to me that they thought there was a 59-early 60 style
with "bent pipes underneath".  I don't know what that means.  My ex-Feb.
1960 Double Cab seat looked like normal rear seat to me.
