Subject: Oxidized Paint fixes

Perhaps this is flogging a dead horse but here it goes.

I have a 65  sealing wax red/beige grey buswith original paint that is =
quite heavily oxidized from sitting in the sun for years. I want to keep =
the original paint but would like to revitalize its original shine as much =
as possible. Note that the paint has burnt through in a few spots due to =
sun damage. So what suggestions/products do people have for removing a =
minimum of paint (as most polishing/buffing procedures do) while also =
restoring the shine?

Other question- wasn't someone like Wolfsburg West selling touch up cans =
of VW original paint? I had a look on their site and can't find any =
mention of them any more. Anyone have any experience on how accurate their =
touch ups are. I realize I can't expect miracles but something reasonably =
close to the original would be nice.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
