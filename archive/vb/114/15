Subject: speedo question

My 1958 Single Cab came with three speedos.  Not all were installed of 
course.  A bug speedo is currently in the vehicle.  I also have a mph bus 
speedo and a kmh speedo.  As the truck is a European Bus, I'd like to get 
the kmh speedo in there.  The problem lies in the broken needle.  Is there a 
way to remove the needle from one of the other speedos (the bug one) and 
place it in the kmh bus speedo?

Thanks,
