Subject: [VB] Stuff going in trash

My brother, a former splittie and type 3 owner has to part
with his collection of stuff he gathered over the years of
his VW ownership.  I am going to make a run out there soon,
but need to let him know what he should try to save.  He has
a splittie front bumper, lots of tin, old generators,
starters, a couple of blown engines (he said spun bearings).
For type 3, he has some engine stuff including a pair of
heaters.  If there is any interest, let me know at
terry.mcginnis(-at-)lmco.com and I'll see what I can save from
the junk heap.

peace,
terry & Sunshine ('64 Westy)
