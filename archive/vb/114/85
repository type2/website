Subject: Re: [VB] Puyallup Road Trip [long]

I didn't go camping, but the Puyallup show was fun.  Nice seeing the listee 
travelers too.  I ended up with a swap space outside, and got sunburnt!!!!    
I was looking at a ratty 63 SC with green crust growing on it and got 
interviewed by a reporter from the New Tribune.
