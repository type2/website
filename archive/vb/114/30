What are folks using to seal between the Westy Window and the Frame that
attaches to the Bus?  The Material that was in there looked like
something we, in the Autobody field, use to call Dum Dum Putty.  I
thought I had heard of someone here mention that before.  Lowes doesn't
seem to carry it.  So I guess it will be Silicone Chalking.
