Subject: Engine Break In


After a long hiatus our 63 Panel is nearly ready to go.  8-years it has 
languished: garaged in Winter, driveway in summer... my son has redone the 
entire underside in corrosion protection, new electrical, rebuilt trans and 
redux boxes, pedal assemblies, brakes, hoses... a long row to hoe.

So now, it is time to break in the engine... we have "heard" stories of 
different weight oils to help with the break in period... and now it is time 
to hear from the list.  What weight oil and why?  We are going to go with 
Gene Bergs recommendation to go 200 miles and then pull to  retorque but 
some have "commented" lighter oil for break in others not.  Constructive 
opinions plz... Clara if you could, Ronnie? Thom?  I respect many of you out 
there so make your opinion known and remember to say why... just an oil 
weight is not going to cut it.  Blame it on my son the Machinist... sigh.

This list is killer... don't know if there are any Willie N fans out there 
but remember the tune... "On the road again"?
