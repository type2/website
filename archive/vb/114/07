Subject: bus sighting (longish)

hey everyone-
today my ex showed me two busses he noticed while driving around ( who would 
have known he was good for something!!) they are both really rotted, one more 
than the other. one is a 62 camper, i think a so-22 or 23, or posibly a 
sundiel??? it has tent mounts, but not the runner kind, the ones that look 
like oles would slide through them. it has all the origianal seats ( the 
doors were open, and it was out on the street), the bed isnt the z-bed kind, 
i think the rear seat and the 3/4 reare-facing seat met to become a bed. i 
looked around and everything is there- thought the body is COMPLETELY rusted. 
there is moss growing in the rain gutters and barely and floor left. it still 
has som savable bits, like the nose, dash (w/ origianal radio) reaer 
corners..tranny...
the other is a plain 65, but it has about half of all the origianal "salt & 
pepper" door panels, and also has the origianal radio. this one isnt AS 
rusted, everything but the floor is salvagible. 
they are parked in chico, ca...anybody know anything abou them??
ps..i asked a guy across the street about if he knew anything, and he said he 
didnt,...but he knows of a junkyard with "about a dozen old busses"  hes 
heading up where it is later this week, and is going to call me and tell me 
if there sitll there...ill tell you guys wher eit is later ;)
