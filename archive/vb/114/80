Subject: Re: [VB] Brake pedal and BN4

crawl under you bus with a flashlight and look at the area unde rthe brake 
pedal, just in front of the MC.  look at where the push rod attaches to the 
pivoting arm.  if that end of the arm was not kept lubed, it has probably 
worn-  holes ovaled. look at the pin holding the push rod assembly on- 
probably grooved wore in it.  can you get a new push rod holder? (the push 
rod screws in to the holder) I dunno.  you can get a new pin  (clevis pin) at 
a hardware store though.

or you can adjust your MC push rod- to give the right amount of free play 
before the brakes come on.

is this what you mean?  or do you have squishy brakes?

 Is there anyone out there who knows how to fix this?
 My brake pedal is real sloppy. I have regreased it,
 installed a new spring and it still isn't too great.
 Can these wear out? Can a new sleeve or bushing be put
 in or are they even available?
 Secondly, Is there anyone out there who has an old (67
 earlier BN4? All I really need is the stand; the part
 that mounts to the body and supports the heater, The
 rest I don't need.
