Here is the wiring of the 12V equiv of the 6V Emergency relay for a 65 and
earier bus.

Terminal #                             bus wire color

30                                           Black with blue stripe
86                                           Gray
87b                                         Black with white stripe
87                                           Black with green stripe
85                                           Ground (no wire exists on 6V
version)

All wires but ground are a direct plug-in to the 12V relay. You have to make
your own ground connection to the body on this relay. On the 6V relay, the
ground was made through the clip on the top that attached the relay to a
boss on the body.
