Flaps without a thermostat is just louvered holes. Good luck to your
longevity.

I know conventional wisdom these days is to run both
thermostat and flaps, but I have had good luck running
only flaps, no thermostat (even in North Country
temperatures decades below zeros).  That is,
everything in its place except the bellows.  You might
have to let her warm up a bit, but one of the selling
points of an air cooled engine is how fast it warms
up.
