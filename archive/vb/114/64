Matt, just add another battery tray to the other side and add rack clusters
to a cutout on your overhead vent. If you pull your luggage tray that should
give you enough room for extra equipment and throwing away the radio and
installing your ILS/VOR along with the VHF/HF radio panels will compliment
your Collins rack. Now if you had an SC like mine, you could install it all
in the treasure chest with appropriate cooling system ! Also, you may want
to install ARINC 629 if you plan on installing a Connections Phased Array
antenna on your roof for future phone, internet, and cable TV options.

Food for thought!

I was going to put a full Collins stack in my Bus, flight computer,
glass cockpit, dual ARINC-429 buses, the works.  Then I found out
I'd have to upgrade the Bus to 28 volt.  If the wind gets real bad,
an HSI might help.  But the thing I reallly want is TCAS with
moron prox (kinda like ground prox, but different -- helps avoid
those ugly CFISUV incidents).

There is a Bus in a junkyard near Tulsa that was apparently owned
by a pilot or aircraft mechanic; it has all kinds of placards that
belong in an aircraft stuck on the dash, air vent, etc.
