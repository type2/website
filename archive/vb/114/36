If you are running a 32/36 Weber you need to check it for vacuum leaks.
These carbs are a pain in the rear to get right, but when they are, they
are!

Greetings Honorable Bus List Members:

I am perplexed: I own a 1967 DLX with a 1776 motor single carb with oil
bath. Running great except for this: When warming up, the idle is set to
around 900 RPMs. When fully warmed up, the Idle goes to 1300-1500 RPMs when
standing still. I turn the idle screw clockwise (the big screw on the left
side of the carb) and bring the idle back to 900 RPMs. I drive away, and at
the next stop, it is back to 1300-1500 Rpms. I repeat my steps three more
times, and the same thing happens, back to 1300-1500 at idle.

Any observations, comments or cuss words would be welcome..........
