Subject: RE: [VB] Stuff going in trash

I sent the original message and neglected to mention that
the stuff is in Sacramento, CA and that I am in Santa Cruz.
He also has a couple of spring plates in addition to the
front bumper, tin, type 3 engine parts (including a pair of
heaters), generators, starters and a couple of blown
engines.  Since he hasn't had a VW for years, his honey is
getting tired of moving the stuff, so it is going to
disappear forever soon and he and I hate to see that happen.

peace,
