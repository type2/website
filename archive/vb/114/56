Thanks for the heads up. I found it here:

BTW- anyone know who the owner of the early Bay that 
appeared on "Dharma and Greg" is? It was on screen a LOT.
Kinda kool, although a split would have been better.

Looking at the REI spring cycling mailer and on page 
26: "Sugoi Windows Jersey"
a cycling shirt with a picture of a red and white 21 or 
23 window rolling
through a psychadelic desert, $70. Very nice but too 
expensive for my tastes
(kinda like the 21/23 window) but maybe you have the bus 
and need the shirt to
go with it...
Bus is best.
