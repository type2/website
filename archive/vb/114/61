Subject: NEW  36 HP pistons and cylinders/monday

  I have been informed by my importer that the new 36 HP pistons and liners
will be available on Monday. These (I was told) are Kolbenschimdt, Germany.
They are NEW not NOS. There is a limited supply and I'm sure will be sold
out by tomorrow. Check with your local supplier or with me. I have as many
sets as I was allowed to order on hold. I cannot say if this is a one time
deal or not.
