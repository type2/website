And be sure to refill that RGB with oil before running the bus!

 Hi Lee,
 Depends on what shape the used plugs were in.  We would just drain that side
 RGB, then unbolt that RGB from the swing plate and degrease the RGB inner side
 and the area of swing plate it seats against.  Then apply a thick enough
 application of silicon sealant and before it sets bolt the RGB back to the swing
 plate.  So far this has worked for us!
