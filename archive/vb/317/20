Subject: Re: [VB] 67 only tank?

right... here what you are finding is that parts list show what the 
dealership sold at the time the list was published... NOT what was originally sold on 
the bus.

you see the 055B version fits through 67, so teh A version  would be the fuel 
sender less version.   the plain (letter suffix) version would be barndoor, 
and I think the earlier barndoors were different, but that was with the 
previous numbering system and so wouldn't shown up  on the laster style number

I've found that some parts were changed cosmetically without changing the 
partnumber.   like the reinforced slider window laches have the same p/n as the 
non reinforced ones... same application so same number I guess.

The hump addition to the tank is not listed in progressive changes either, as 
least that I coudl find.

So I did a little research in the parts book..... tank # 211 201 055B fits 
from chassis # 20- 117902    One
tank for all from about Dec 54 to the end of 67 year models.

Unless I am missing something in the parts book, I do not see any bulging 
factory tank in 67.

I do have reservations about 'one tank for all' since the early buses did not 
have a fuel gauge?
