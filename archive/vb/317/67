Well, in the summertime your heaterboxes are in the closed position, so the
airflow through them is minimal (the little turtle shell looking tings up
top are the exit vent for air to continue moving through them) compared to
the big picture. I don't think the gain of airflow would be noticable.

I would personally leave the heaterboxes in place, as they complete the
lower cooling system. Without them, hot air from the heads and cylinders
would not be forced out the back of the car as much, and instead, a portion
would exit out the side. That may not cause a problem, but I personally like
having everything in place.

Another reason I would vote to leave the boxes in place, is just in case
something happened to the gas heater, you still have some heat. This
happened in my old 64. Driving down the highway when it suddenly started
getting really cold in the bus.  If I had my stock boxes wired up, I could
have driven to a good place to check the heater out instead of having to
pull over right away (where puddles and heavy traffic was) to see what was
wrong with the heater. Luckily it was just the fuse on the heater, othewise,
I would have been a mess after crawling under the bus on wet ground to open
the stock boxes. And with a 1 year old in the car with me, i'm not about to
drive for any distance on a cold winter day without heat.

JMHO.
