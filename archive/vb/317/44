Subject: [VB] bus joint/group ownership?

  As most agree that bus prices are high; I was wondering if anybody out there has or does own a bus with another person or people?
	The amatauer airplane people do this.  Since alot of people don't depend on their bus for regular transport -or- have their own bus for that, could it make sens to share.
