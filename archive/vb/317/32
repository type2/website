Hi volks

Check out the link below for some nice words about my busses.  I was 
shocked when the reporter called to do an interview.  Turns out she had 
noticed my busses and recalled how much she liked them.  And,. there 
are now quite a few in our little town.  She didn't get all of the 
facts quite right, but it is close to true :)!

The fun part or all this is that the article will probably send one of 
my neighbors into low earth orbit.  We have a 72 hour parking ordinance 
in our town, and this particular neighbor calls the police at 72 hours 
and 1 minute if it involves one of my busses.  I never say a word to 
her, but I do plan to continue my VW appreciation efforts by parking in 
front of her house as often as possible!
