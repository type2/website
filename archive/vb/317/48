Yes well placed and order for these and some other
parts with Bus depot and week or two later just a note
saying they did not have most of my parts and
cancelled my order ???...so came on here to look for
them...still no luck as of yet 
any help?

Ronnie do you have theses??? or even the bubble bus
ones used would work great...anything just so i can
drive this truck...
