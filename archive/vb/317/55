The shifter can be replaced by one person. I've done it several times.

You get everything in position as if you were going to drop the shifter
in, bolts in holes, the works. You feed one bolt loosely into its hole,
and then use masking tape to secure the assembly as close to the hole as
possible; I can get it right in there. Then go under and start the nut on
the bolt. It's actually a floating nut in the lower assembly. Once the
first one's in, it's a piece of cake. Undo the tape before finishing it
up, or it'll be there like mine is, from my last adventure with the
shifter - just a piece of tape showing under one of the bolts.
