BUS CONTENT: Traveled from Phx to Irvine last fall to see Neil Young's
Greendale concert.
I was about x beers into the Greendale CD and pressed the SEND button with no
response/feedback. Sorry for the multiple posts. Not sorry for the multiple
beers! =)

Newbies note: This list used to be pretty wild and fun. Now IMHO it's about as
interesting as reading the daily obituaries after the cat has soiled them.
Basically, I have made the transition from hypothetically being a member of
Vintage Transporters Only (shout out to my peeps!) to needing to form a new
club called Watercoolers Only to describe my driveway.
Total support and encouragement to those who continue to enjoy and pursue
aircooled buses.
