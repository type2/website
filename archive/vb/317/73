Subject: 63 Oz bus and twin cab trivia

Well,

After hitting a pair of the 'one ton' spindles
(early pre-63 20mm link pins, later post 63
king pins and spindles) on my twin cab I came
across another pair on another 63 bus. And another
pair on another 63 bus...

Anyway, based on a small sample size I'd say it looks
like this combination was a standard fit an all 63 busses
produced in Australia rather than an option.....(we love
tracking our country's perversions).  The same spindle 
sets were used to build the Australia 'country buggy'
(on beetle beam with torsion arms reamed out to 20mm)
so VW Australia must have had a bunch of these things..

Australian twin cabs also have different tail light
housings (this is the oval post 62 rear housing).  
Same external shape and lense but the one on
the battery tray side is 'thinner' than the one on the other
side (by about 5mm)! Designed to stop battery battering on the housing - or 
to fit a 12V battery if 12v optioned (ie housing was standard
12v was option)?
Same for a sample of 3 twin cabs here.  Is it the same
in the US?
