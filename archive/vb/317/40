Subject: Re: [VB] Sealing r.box core plugs

Hi Lee,
Depends on what shape the used plugs were in.  We would just drain that side 
RGB, then unbolt that RGB from the swing plate and degrease the RGB inner side 
and the area of swing plate it seats against.  Then apply a thick enough 
application of silicon sealant and before it sets bolt the RGB back to the swing 
plate.  So far this has worked for us!
