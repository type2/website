Subject: 67 only tank?

So I did a little research in the parts book..... tank # 211 201 055B fits from chassis # 20- 117902    One
tank for all from about Dec 54 to the end of 67 year models.

Unless I am missing something in the parts book, I do not see any bulging factory tank in 67.

I do have reservations about 'one tank for all' since the early buses did not have a fuel gauge?
