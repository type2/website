Subject: Sealing r.box core plugs

So I've just rebuilt my r.boxes and the used the old core plugs, but one 
of them leaks.  After I put the first one in I decided to put a smear of 
liquid gasket around the second before I put it in.  The first leaks the 
second doesn't  Should I have used sealant anyway or do you think the 
leak was just coincidence ? or should I get a new one ?

thanks all.
