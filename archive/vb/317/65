Subject: Mid America Swap meet...

Hi all,

John Baker, were you at the Mid America Motorworks swap Meet yesterday in
Effingham, IL?  So were we, I wish we had made arrangements to meet up!  I
scored a nice Securit pre-'68 windshield, and two good matching 40hp heads,
rocker arms and covers all for $15. Woooo Hoooo!  I can't wait for their June
Show and swap meet.  But next stop is the huge MVVC Michigan "Vintage VW
Festival" in Yipsilanti, MI in May.  Lots of Buses make it to that one too.
