Subject: Re: [VB] humpy 67 gas tank

I have replaced the tanks in 3 split buses I have
owned: 2 67's and 1 66, with later bay tanks. [I still
have the 66 and one of the 67's]
NONE of the 67's had a bulge in the tank. All were the
same as the 66, flat on top. One 67 was a very early
one [July 66], the other is a late one [Feb 27,67].
