Subject: What do tractors have in common with our buses?

For Christmas, my lovely and wonderful wife gave me some books about the
restoration of tractors.  While buses and tractors may have different
uses, I found a lot of useful information there.  Much of it involved
removing frozen fasteners.  Since the common tractor being restored is a
product of the '20s or '30s and has often been slowly sinking into the
soil behind the barn since Eisenhower was president, their problems with
fasteners is often more severe than those we deal with on VWs.

Their solutions are similar, though.  Penetrating oil, tapping with a
hammer, heat and paraffin wax, and left-hand drilling are all mentioned.

One new method I learned:  The Norwegian Torque Wrench Techique.

Using an air chisel, hammer a groove in the flat face of the offending nut
or bolt.  Then angle the chisel in the desired direction and buzz the
fastener off.

This is similar to Muir's method of removing high torque fasteners except
that the air chisel is used instead of a regular chisel.  Seems pretty
slick.

Tractor Restorer Roger Welsch also has a set of rules entitled:

"Roger's Rules for Collecting Old Iron and Living With Your Wife"

It's on the web at:

Just replace the word "tractor" with the word "bus" and these rules apply
to our passion as well!  :)
