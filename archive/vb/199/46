Yup.  And the coil mount is wrong, too.  I set it aside and
went back into the stash and got the 'correct' one.

Speaking of fan shrouds and such, I had one of those triangular
dealies that goes under the coil and you hang the air cleaner
from.  But this one had a funky lip on one side, while the
others I'd seen didn't.   Now I know why - it's to clear the
fresh air outlet!  Subtle...
