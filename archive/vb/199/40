I have one, it was mounted on a fool injected Beetle.
It's a " flux capacitor"- This "squirrel torque" multiplier
may not provide the 1.8 gigawatts needed to propel
your bus to the prerequisite 88 mph, but at least they
won't lose their nuts trying.
I think this needs some "Clara-fication".
I was under the assumption that it was a venturi, but
from Ray's description, it doesn't sound like a speed part.
