Subject: Sad Tale of Windows

I have been restoring my 1956 Kombi for two years, which included repainting
the inside window frame (for the pop-out side windows) and new rubber.

Last night someone broke into my garage and broke out the two side windows
with a rock they found outside.  They didn't steal anything, none of my
tools, not the repainted VW front emblem laying on the seat, just busted the
windows and chipped the paint.

As you can imagine, I am very bummed.  I only have a few things left on the
restoration, and I havn't had time to get to them in the last months -- and
now this.

They were two Sekuit (sp?) side, pop-outs.  If anyone has some extras for
sales please let me know -- just need the glass.  Also, can someone give me
a rough price for the windows -- so I can tell the insurance company.
