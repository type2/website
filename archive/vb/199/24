Subject: soldering fuse box

was writ:
"Soldering the individual brass clips in the fuse box is a must"

I thought i remember reading about someone on the list soldering the
connections in the fuse box, and then realizing there was some reason the
weren't soldered?

if this is not the case let me know, that may the "missing link" in my
voltage problems in my bus, and it would be an easy fix...

thanks
