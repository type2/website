Subject: Accelerator push rod hole

I am fitting my new pedal rubbers and have come to the accelerator one.
Unfortunately the seal does not fit in the hole I have in my floor, it looks
as if that portion of the floor has been replaced at some point as I can see
seam sealer underneath.  Anyone know what the diameter of the hole should be?
Its a 66 bus if that helps.

Thanks
Paul
