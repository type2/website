If I can dig it up I will post a few pics of obscure uses for dub engines,
upright and flat. In one of the pics it shows an upright driving a hay ladder
for farm use, thus the feathers I presume. I have seen in person the 72" mower
deck with a T-3 and a T-1 engine. Brazil still sells a Kubota style farm
tractor with the T-1 slung underneath and there is the mid-engine Isuzu type
box truck with the T-1 engine, in 4W drive !

Bernoulli Interval: Do I really have enough data to draw a valid conclusion ?

I'm wondering if an industrial motor would have a
doghouse. I'm also particularly concerned about the
chicken feathers.
