Been on vacation, just saw the hub-bub on this Samba ad while catching
up on my emails.

FWIW the 'Old Cars Price Guide' gives its highest ballpark value to a
mint-condition, trailer queen 1966 Deluxe as $27,000.  A 'merely'
outstanding resto rates a value of only $19,000 and our seller should
keep that in mind as most of his target audience probably knows it
already.  I agree that this fellow is either a) thinking emotionally and
not rationally, or b) starting with a high price expecting to be talked
down (but then why scare off lookers with such an outrageous price?), or
perhaps c) he's decided to limit his market to foreign buyers figuring
that they have excess bucks to spare and don't know the real value of
this merchandise.

How else to explain such an unrealistic asking price for this vehicle?
