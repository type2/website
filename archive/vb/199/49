yup - FI bug, and if you don't mind a little tweaking, prolly the 
best shroud to use on a bus... that venturi was added to improve the 
air flow (not sure if it simply speeds it up - venturi effect - or 
smoothes the flow into the fan to a more laminar state), and i have 
been told the vaning inside is slightly different. haven't cut mine 
open to look!

i drilled a new hole for my accel cable and plugged off the FI cable 
holes - it is a bit tricky, as there are some vanes very close to 
where you want to drill the new hole.
