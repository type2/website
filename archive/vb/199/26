Subject: RE: [VB] soldering fuse box

When I had my 71 westy and 65 DC I had a couple of tabs break off because of
age. I used 95/5 solder and my jewelers tip for the propane torch to solder it
back on. Regular solder is more lead than tin and is too soft. 95/5 is hard
after cooling and has a better tensile strength for the springy ends of the
fuse clips. It is standard code water pipe solder. Be sure to use the proper
flux.

was writ:
"Soldering the individual brass clips in the fuse box is a must"

I thought i remember reading about someone on the list soldering the
connections in the fuse box, and then realizing there was some reason the
weren't soldered?

if this is not the case let me know, that may the "missing link" in my
voltage problems in my bus, and it would be an easy fix...

thanks
