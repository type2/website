Hi Kevin,
As far as we have heard and can figure it was just an inexpensive way to just 
push the individual brass clips in each spot in the fuse box.  Sometime in 
the late 1970s VW spot welded these brass clips together after finally 
installing a ground wiring system for the bus taillights starting about 1970!
