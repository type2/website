A real collectors piece, most of those don't make it into the country since
hardly anyone in the US wants VW industrial motors. They were intended for
motors that run at a single speed for long periods at a time and acted like
kind of a governor for the air. The engines rarely operated over 3600 rpm,
most around 2800-3200 rpm. My VolksAir air compressor operates at 2400 rpm and
will probably outlast me!

It's a fan shroud I got at the Big Binge out in Rio Linda a couple of months
ago.
