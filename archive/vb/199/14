Hey,

I thought it was funny watching the TNN James Bond marathon last week - 
they were showing From Russia With Love, and a red/white deluxe 
followed James home from the Istanbul airport, showed up in the scene 
when the taxi let James out at the hotel, then showed up again the next 
day when he left the hotel. I think that was one of the best parts of 
the movie...
