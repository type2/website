good point - but rimco clearly states 'clearanced for 73' on 
invoice.... maybe why i had to do extra clearancing?

>main and rod journal measurements vary by.03mm ( .0011")

they also give spec at .000  lift there is .390; at .050 its .355

>You measured to base circle. Subtract the lift.

not sure if i follow - i measured with cam pointed at lifter, lifter 
fully seated in bore. perhaps this is where i goofed?

my local shop buddy said drive it for 25 miles (gingerly!) and then 
drain oil. look for shavings. if none, it ain't internal - hopefully!
if metal, apart it goes.

in any case (HA HA) i need to build my previous motor back up with 
the leftover parts, and get a spare so's i can at least get around...

btw, many thanx to dave, who has 'talked' to me almost as much as 
ronnie - poor guy :)
