I have a doghouse fan shroud with an additional 'ring'
where the cooling air goes in, similar to a 36hp thermo
ring - what's the purpose of this?  I'm guessing it's
some sort of velocity manipulator, either that or it's
a conspiracy to blow up engines (ala thermal reactors
in the mid 70s).  Should I leave it?  Take it off?
