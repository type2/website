Subject: Tranny Question

My son's 66 split-window has had a RGB go bad. I am going to bit the bullet
and have both boxes rebuilt and the tranny replaced with a "freeway flyer".
Any sugeestions on  gearing./ One tranny rebuilder suggested a 3:08 another
sugessted 3:88. We just want to cruise 70 without the
RPM's maxing out. (I do not know if the bus has a 44mm or 39mm nut)
Thanks
