  If you never had them on the road, I am sure Bus Boys would be more then
happy to replace them for free, except shipping. They are very good on
warrenty issues

Hi,

A year ago December, I got refurbed king pin assemblies from Bus Boys. 
They have seen no road use since then. Today, I was moving over to the 
spindles to work on putting the hubs back on and noticed that the top 
king pin rubber seal is cracked.

Is this common? I would not have guessed that it would have cracked so 
easily. I had the parts greased through the zerks, but assumed that new 
rubber seals wouldn't have done this.

Also, the passenger side spindle is very tight, I have to exert about 
80 lbs. to move it. The other side is obviously much easier to move.

Are these spindles hosed, and time to send them back? If/when I spend 
another $250 on these, what should I do to make sure this doesn't 
happen again?

Thanks,
Conrad
