Time to go back to the sand box for you boys, literally. My grandfather showed
me a method that I have used a couple of times since. You take a couple of 2 X
10's about 8' long and whack 1' off of each one. Those two pieces become the
ends of a 7' long sand box. I get my sand by the truck load, but bagged sand
will work just fine. Lay your bumper round side down in the sand and use your
curved body hammer to form out the smooth dents and a torch to heat up the
sharp dents before pounding. Take it slow and easy and after awhile you will
have your dents pounded out. If wrinkles remain, you can always take your
torch and lead them in, grinding down smooth when cool.

If you have the time and patience, with a good body hammer, body dolly and
file, you can take these parking lot dents out yourself. Takes a little
practice to get the "touch", but the old VW bumper metal is quite workable.
