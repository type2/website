Subject: RE: [VB] soldering fuse box

This is  a common improvement on VOlv0s as well, and I did this to my 4 fuse
544. YOu need a HOT iron so you don't bake the box trying to get good solder
jobs on the banks with a POS iron.
You could also adopt keeping it very clean and tight, and resulting to
solder as a reaction to the circuts you can't get tight.
I'm still trying to prove the other half Coke is posion by cleaning all the
electricals in it, just the connector seems to suck power down unless
cleaned VERY well.
AL


was writ:
"Soldering the individual brass clips in the fuse box is a must"

I thought i remember reading about someone on the list soldering the
connections in the fuse box, and then realizing there was some reason the
weren't soldered?

if this is not the case let me know, that may the "missing link" in my
voltage problems in my bus, and it would be an easy fix...
