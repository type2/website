Try a True Value hardware store or possibly an Ace.  Home Depot and
Lowe's are not hardware stores.  Around 8 years ago, my Dad and I were
searching for an 8mm tap for his Bug and it went like this:

     Home Depot: "Metric?  Huh?"
Builders Square: "No, we don't have any metric taps."
     True Value: "Sure.  You want regular or fine pitch?"

One way to find a good hardware store is to ask somebody who owns a
50+-year-old house where they buy hardware.

Another possibility is Harbor Freight tools.  I know they sell sets of
taps and dies that are inexpensive and I think they sell individual
pieces.  The quality may not be real great but for chasing threads,
as opposed to cutting new threads in hard steel, it's probably OK.
