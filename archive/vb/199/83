Maybe this guy is getting pressure from his wife to sell the bus.

He's probably telling her "I have it advertised and everything, it's not my
fault if nobody wants it", when all the while, he's put such a high price on
it that it could never possibly sell, and he's done this so he can keep it.

Just a thought.  I know that's what I'd do if I was getting pressure from
home to get rid of one of my projects that I really wanted to keep.
Fortunately for me, my wife would never do that, but I know some guys whose
wife's only thoughts towards their busses is that the project has turned
into the money pit.
