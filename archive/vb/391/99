Subject: Re: [VB] Engine Tin - for 1641 into a 60

John,

As far as loud goes, I don't think the 1641 will be any quieter. I have 
about 200 pounds of insulation and soundproofing in my bus. With extractor 
exhaust and a quiet pack muffler, it was too loud on the freeway to ride 
without ear plugs. I have since installed a stock muffler and its now OK on 
the freeway. Still noisy, but I don't feel compelled to install the 
earplugs. The stock muffler made a larger difference than I was expecting in 
HP at freeway speed.

BTW I have a 1776 in my 64DD delivery camper. I also have a 3.88 freeway 
flier big nut trannee. Sorry I didn't go with the 3.44. That would have 
dropped the freeway RPMs down far enough to reduce the engine noise ( travel 
at 70+ on the open road). Also, make sure the valve lash is properly 
adjusted. As I found out recently, my engine is a whole lot quieter when 
that is done right. You might think about hydraulic lifters, always zero 
lash with those. Also, a good balance job on all rotating parts will help.

Cheers!
Chris
