Depending on how much is torn, it can be pounded back into shape and the 
rivets welded from the back side.  I (meaning my TIG-welding friend) did 
this on an upper hinge where the rivets were pulling out and tearing the 
door metal around the rivets.

This requires you to remove the door from the Bus to gain easy access from 
the back side, of course.
