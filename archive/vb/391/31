Subject: Looking for 5.5 or 6 inch wide wide 5 Bus rims

Looking for a set of Stock 15 inch Bus (split window type) rims that have been
widened to 5/5 or 6 inches.  Anyone have any for sale?

Can't seem to find anyone on the east coast to widen rims. I know of Stocktons
on the West coast.  But with shipping and charge it's a bit much.
