Subject: Engine Tin - for 1641 into a 60

So ... I'm having a couple of problems.  I'm planning on putting a 1641 into 
my 60 - it currently has a 40 hp engine.  What tin will I need?

Also - what do people use to attach the heater things to the bus in a 60. 
I'm currently using that flexible foil stuff - but that ain't right - ideas?

TIA
