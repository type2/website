Hi Dave,
Well definitely get yourself a copy of one ASAP.  It will save you a  lot of 
$$$, and keep you working on your bus safer.
 
Cracked doors can be repaired with reinforcements, Part No. 211 831  525/526, 
as follows:
Remove door, and weld cracks inside and out.  Rivets must also be  welded.  
If badly cracked an additional reinforcement, as shown in  illustration must be 
welded on.  Place reinforcement on  outside so the holes in the reinforcement 
coincide with rivet  heads.  Weld reinforcement to door inner panel as shown 
in  illustration.  Electrically weld rivet heads to reinforcement.
