Subject: Camper Interiors

Funny how there seems to be at least 5 or so places in the U.K. selling 
interior/camper kits and ......... zero here in N.A.  I'm sure part of it 
must have to do with the unavailability of Brazilian buses in N.A. but still 
.... too bad someone wasn't selling those fancy U.K. kits .... I kinda like 
this one http://www.vanwurks.co.uk/type2.shtml

but some of the others are nice too.
