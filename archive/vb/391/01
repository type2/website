Hi Harmony,
Hmm, we have a 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion.  We do not need  no 
stinking fuel gauge!  ;-)
  That is what the reserve switch is for to get you the last 20-30  miles to 
the next gas station, especially in town.  Plus we keep both track  of last 
fuel fill up, and any maintenance in a log book.  That way we can  keep in mind 
that every 100-150 miles on a stock ten gallon pre-1968 tank  to fill up.  
Need more miles between fill ups?  You can install a 15  gallon 1968-71 bus tank 
and stretch the fill up stops to easily 150-200  miles.  Check out 
vintagebus.com website for step by step info and images  on this upgrade.
  Invest in oil pressure and temp gauges, that are much more  important to 
your VW.
