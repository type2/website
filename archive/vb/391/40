Subject: Long block vs turnkey

I've got a 64 bus to restore.  Currently has no engine and I have shopping for
the best deal on an engine.  Wouldn't mind putting in 1776 or 1835 instead of
a 1600.  Now the question is, I have seen pricing on long blocks and turnkey
engine.  Price difference of $1,000 to $1,500 more for the turn key.  Is it
worth it to pay the turnkey price or can I collect the additional parts for
alot less?  I know it would need carb, manifold, generator and stand, pulleys,
distributor and cooling tin.  What else would a long block need?
