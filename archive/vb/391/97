Subject: Re: [VB] Engine Tin - for 1641 into a 60

Hi John,
Each piece of tin used will depend on the piece of tin you choose  near it.
  EG you have to use doghouse front tin if you are going to use a  doghouse 
shroud system, and if you use an earlier shroud you need to use  non-doghouse 
front tin.
  If you use a 1500 or 1967 only rear tin you need matching  under pulley 
piece, and the left or later right hand tin under at the rear tin  with small 
heat riser tube.  If you use later rear tin, you must use a  matching under 
pulley piece, and figure out how to convert the later larger  preheat tube to the 
earlier air cleaner tubing size.
   Fortunately the head tin and the lower heater  channel tin are not so 
problematic, and can be used with most other  1300, 1500, & 1600 tins.  Though 
with the head tin you need to make  sure it is for thermostatic flaps or the 65 
of earlier throttle ring type of  thermostatic system.  
  There are sure to be more ifs, ands, & buts to  this........
