Subject: ADMIN: Subscribers can post to both lists

Hello all!

This is a reminder that anyone that is subscribed to Type2 can post to
VintageBus and anyone that is subscribed to VintageBus can post to
Type2.  This is done as a convenience to subscribers.  If you love your
'72 Westy but have a few questions about that '61 single-cab that's for
sale down the street, or if you have memorized the parts list for your
'67 Deluxe but can't find the carburetor on your friend's '78, then
this feature is for you!  A good way to see replies to your question
without subscribing is to use the Web interfaces at
http://www.type2.com/type2reflect/ and
http://www.type2.com/vintagebusreflect/ .

Please note that each list has its own group of moderators and the
standards are somewhat different between the two lists.  Before posting
to the "other" list for the first time, take a moment to read the last
few days' worth of messages for that list on the Web interface to get a
feel for the difference.  If you find yourself posting many messages to
the "other" list, subscribing to it is probably a good idea.

Thanks!
