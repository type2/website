Hi,

I stripped a '65 Mustang that had that stuff. I used a heat gun and  
scraper to get it off. I'm sure it was toxic as all hell and  
eventually I'll pay for it. But that was when I was 19 and didn't care.

My '65 Bus had/has pink bondo on top of paint on top of blue bondo on  
top of paint on top of gray bondo on top of the original paint. :-0
