Have you asked the Type2 list?  There should be more experience there on
the later model engines.  If you subscribe to VintageBus, you are
automatically allowed to post to Type2, and vice versa.  I'll send out
an email shortly with a little more information on this.

My '64 Bus has the mystery motor that was in it when I bought it.  By
case number it's a 1500 from a '68 Bug but it may have been rebuilt to
a 1600.  Either way it's pretty tired so I can't really tell.  I put a
new 009 on it when I got it - I know it's probably not the best choice
for this engine, but it had a Porsche 356 distributor on it that was
even worse.

Anyway, I timed the 009 statically and then hooked up my handy dandy
advance adjustable strobe timing light.  As I revved up the engine,
I could see the advance.  This was a while back, but what I remember
is that with the engine revved up to and held at about 3500-3600, the
timing was pretty steady.  The mark might have jumped a degree or so
left and right of center, but to me that's within the margin of error
for this system.

I agree that you want to check the full advance timing and not have it
advanced "too far", where "too far" is defined by people that know more
about an 1800 than I do.

You may want to set it a little shy of the "max" to give you room to
play if you want it.  For example, if the late-model types say "don't
go over 36 degrees total", you might set it at 30 or 32 degrees and
drive it to see how you like that.  Then advance it to maybe 32 or 34
degrees total and drive some more.  Basically you are trying to match
the distributor advance curve to the carb, engine, gearing, your driving
style, etc.

I hope this helps!
