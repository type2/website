Subject: Who has gas? I don't know, no gauge...

Good morning all!
I am working on this 60 bus, it is pre-gas gauge era.
Anyone ever retro-fit a later tank with a gas gauge in
one of these early splits? To me, it seems like it
would be as easy as puttin in the new tank with a
sender, intsalling a gauge on the dash and running the
wires as normal?? Am I over-simplifying this
retro-fit, is it really as easy as it seems to me???
If so, anyone want to trade a later split tank with
sender for an early split tank with the reserve tap included??
