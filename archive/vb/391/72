What am I missing here?

"Completely restored within last 8 yrs"

and then:

"Straight axel rear, ajustable front beam, 1641 W/dual dellortos"

Not restored in any way shape or form.  Like someone calling a '57 Chevy
with a 350 engine/350 auto trans
restored. The word is MODIFIED!

Sorry, had to rant.
