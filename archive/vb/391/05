Subject: Re: [VB] bug fenders

I agree with Clara (hi Clara!), these are OS2.  At Airhead Parts in Ventura,
CA ( http://airheadparts.com ), they have their fender boxes custom made, so
they are sized just right, but they're still OS2 for UPS or FEDEX.  Keep in
mind that with their boxes and the typical fender shaping, you may only pack
one FRONT fender per box, but can pack 2 REAR fenders in one box.

I really can't see how any savings will be made by putting them on a plane
as oversized luggage.
