To those of you who could have gone to this FREE car show benefiting Toyz
for Totz, you really missed out. There was a total of 5 VWs in a car show
that exceeded 400+. !!! What a Bummer for the VW Hobby in this area. This is
a FREE show and every car that comes gets a free raffle ticket to win a door
prize. The quality of the cars is incredible, but there are also a lot of
just plain drivers. FREE coffee and Doughnuts, At the show there is hot food
and crafts and a Chinese auction.  You name it, it was there for you. This
was the 21st year.  The first one had 6 cars. !! It's held every year at
this time.  So you want to cruise in your VW.?  Then show up. !! Needless to
say I am not happy with the VW people that could have made it and did not.
Bummer, Bless all of you and thanks, hope to see you there next Year.?, uj
