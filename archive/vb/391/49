Subject: FS: Tucson AZ '62 Custom Kombi Camper

I'm telling the good folks at the VB list about this before I advertise
it; pictures and more details to come.

1962 Custom Kombi Camper (small rear window, icepicks, churchkey gas and
engine lid), 1600DP late model longblock with alternator; also have what
might be original motor in parts.  Full length roof rack.  Front seats
are P.O.'s custom job with Toyota buckets, divider was cut out.  I have
the divider and correct seats (springs and frame only, not
upholstered.)  Cabin has a custom bed platform, rear and overhead
cabinets.   12V, Done Right, Doghouse and Engine tins complete, old
type, and Done Right, By Me.  HPC-coated heaterboxes.  A good reliable
weird splitty camper, which has served me well as a daily driver for
years and years, and has been my friend on many a road trip. 
Could be yours. 

$4500.00.  Located near Speedway & Wilmot, Tucson AZ.
