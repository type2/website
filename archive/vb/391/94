Subject: RE: [VB] Engine Tin - for 1641 into a 60

John,

Not sure about the tin, but it would seem any late model tin would seem to
fit nicely. As for the heat, for lack of a better term, I call them 'heater
mufflers'. I attached mine to the heater tubes on the Bus using the stock
clamps and 13mm head bolts and then used some fresh air hose, 3" ID, to
attach to the heat exchangers. To connect the fresh air hose to the heater
mufflers, I used 3"OD PVC pipe, a couple of worm drive clamps and it flows
nicely.
Good luck,
Gary

So ... I'm having a couple of problems.  I'm planning on putting a 1641 into

my 60 - it currently has a 40 hp engine.  What tin will I need?

Also - what do people use to attach the heater things to the bus in a 60. 
I'm currently using that flexible foil stuff - but that ain't right - ideas?
