Subject: Re: [VB] Engine Tin - for 1641 into a 60

OK - well - I'm planning on a 1641 sp - out of a 1500 or 1600 - I planning 
on running my current tranny and redux boxes (not sure what year but small 
nut for sure).  I might plan on a fwy flier eventually - but I want to see 
how it runs with the original tranny (or period tranny) and the 1641 - I'm 
guessing slow but not as loud as the 40 hp ... anyway - I want to start 
gathering up tin - can you advise my as to what I need?

My bus is a pretty much stock 60. I don't want to change redux boxes as I 
have a spare set and I like the idea of the cheapish bearings in the small 
nut boxes.

TIA
