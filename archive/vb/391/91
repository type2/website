Morning ladies & gents,
   
  Question for you all that are smarter than me.  
   
  I have a 1965 bus with newer 1671 cc engine with a 34 pic3 carb.  For the most part, the engine runs beautifully.  However, when it's hot, at higher RPM, from time-to-time, there is a stuttering, almost sounds like backfiring without the bang (for everyone up north, it feels like a fuel line about the freeze up).  The car will be cruising along greatly, then suddenly get these spurts of lost power, jerking.  Drop the clutch, let the bus slow down, bring the power & speed back up, runs great for another bunch of mile, may or maynot repeat the loss of power.
   
  I've checked the valves, timing, carb, etc.  Anyone know what this is?  I have not removed the head to check the cylinder for carbon etc.
   
  Thanks,
   
  Jim.
