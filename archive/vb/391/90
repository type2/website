If the dual-circuit master cylinder is a retrofit, and your Bus
originally had a single-circuit master cylinder, you might make sure
the two brake light switches on the master cylinder are wired correctly.
They should be in parallel, not in series.  In pictures, you should have
this (use a fixed width font):

from fuse box---*---front switch
                 |   front switch---\
                 |                  |
                 \---rear switch    |
                     rear switch----*---to 9-prong box

and NOT this:

from fuse box------front switch
                /---front switch
                |
                \---rear switch
                    rear switch------to 9-prong box

The first way (in parallel) will turn on the brake lights when _either_
switch closes.  The second way (in series) will only turn on the brake
lights when _both_ switches are closed.
