My 60 had some roof damage - I tried to fix it but and it worked OK - no one 
had ever noticed the damage but I knew it was there - so, since it had that 
damage I'm cutting in a pop-top.  I have two Dorper tops and a small westy 
top - the Dorper tops are like small westy pop-tops only bigger (Dorper was 
a B.C. camper conversion company). I was going to use the westy pop-tops but 
... since its on a 60, a westy pop-top is clearly not right but the Dorper 
top ... while still not right its not right in the way that a Dormoble 
wouldn't be right.

If you have any friends or family ... looking for a small westy pop-top - 
from a .. 65 or so westy complete with hinges and all the hardware ... :) - 
I'll let it go cheap - or at least at my cost.
