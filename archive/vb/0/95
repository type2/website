Subject: Generator pulling

Hi renoir here,

I overtightened my belt and fried the bearing.
I seem to remember reading about that here once before, boo hoo.

Thinking, motor out.
Can I pull that out straight through the back, without pulling off the
doghouse?
Change the bearing or put in another generator, and slide it back in.
I thought I had read this somewhere.

Thank the stars for AAA extended towing, from San Bernadino, back to San
Diego.
And I just got through putting in new tranny and cv's.

Renoir
Somewhat exacerbated!
