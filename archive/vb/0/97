    Here you guys go, beat the scaplers and the e-barfs and order your new
bus direct

http://www.libertypromotions.com/cars/BlackVwBusOrder.htm

You get a free oil change coupon when you order also, so the deal is 1 free
bus with the purchase of an oil change,  and you can order up to 5 more at a
discount rate.
