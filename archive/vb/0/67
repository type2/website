Subject: Re: [VB] Dead mouse removal?

I was just taking down the headliner on my 65 and lots and lots of debris
fell out including a few mouse skins...... Bus was sitting in a barn since
1979 and wherever you look there's mouse and squirrel nests. Behind gas
tank, on top of the tranny, in battery tray, in the back, over the
headliner, in parcel tray..... etc, etc...... I took pictures while
dismantling the bus to clean it and prep it for a respray so I'll post them
later. Problem with dead mouse might arise after all when I decide to start
the bus up and crank up the heat. I can see parts of what probably is left
overs from their nests sticking out of the heat tube in the back..........
would compressor do the trick?? inserting the hose inside the heat tube??
anybody done this?

Thanks,
