Subject: '64 westy FS on the samba

On my way over to the samba to chk out the previously mentioned '54 FS in 
germany, there's also a pretty rusty subhatch '64 westy in Ohio for sale.  
There's a pretty good set of pix with it, this must be the "transition" 
interior that was used between the SO-34/5, and SO-42 era, no?  Is this an 
SO-33?  I've never seen an example of this type of interior, so I thought it 
was kinda cool.  it looks to me like this interior shared the icebox, cargo 
door "bathroom" cabinet, and right side side clothes cabinet with the 
flipseat westy, but everything else is pretty one of a kind.  The bed 
arrangement doesn't look like it would be that comfy either.

In case anybody needs interior parts for a camper like this, this might be a 
good contact.  Anybody have any idea of how many of those campers are 
around?  It seems to me that this era of westy's in between the flipseats 
and the SO-42's are kind of like "bastard children."  Nobody seems to be 
looking for them.

Now that I've said that, in case someone does buy it for parts, I'd be 
interested in the bathroom cabinet ;-)
