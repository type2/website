Subject: Re: [VB] '64 westy FS on the samba

Does any one have a website or brochure or something that shows the earlier 
(pre SO-42) kits-  I know there is a flip seat, and a icky white formica, and 
the wood with metal trim etc, but have really only a vague concept   Any one 
have something set out that says which kits were available which years and 
what each kit was?  I have a basket case 59 westy with the wood with metal 
trim, and I don't even know what kit it is.
