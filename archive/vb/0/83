Thom--

If all else fails, check out the website of the Automobile License Plate
Collectors Assn. -- http://www.alpca.com/.  Or there is another
excellent plate collectors website at http://www.pl8s.com/ which also
has tons of info.  You are sure to find links at both places to people
who do restoration and/or sales of YOM plates.
