Subject: HCBF - sorry I missed you

Sorry to have missed the HCBF this weekend. I was really pumped about being
there, and it didn't happen. I did get an alarm system on the bus this
weekend. Nice. Anyone want help buying one or installing one? Not bad at
all! couldn't bear to drill holes for pin switches though. Ordered all the
weatherstripping and electronic ignition, will order safari latches and dash
tabs tommorrow.
