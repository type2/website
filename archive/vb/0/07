Subject: pass. door help in SoCal

Hello Listees,

I asked this question to the list about a year ago, and didn't end up acting 
on it, but this time I'm gonna!

I'm in need of a front passenger side door for '61-early '64 bus (icepick 
handles).  They are nowhere to be found in Salt Lake City.
I'm in LA (Westchester, actually) right now, here for another week, and 
Anybody out here have a door they'd like to sell?  Or that can point me in 
the right direction to find one?  Good junkyards, etc.? I've promised myself 
that I will pick up a door for my bus while I am here in the land o' plenty.



Thanks!

Mike A.                 I'm in LA.
'64 SO-34/5 "Sherman"   He's at home in SLC.
