I'm 6'2" - 6'3" and the only way I can see out of the bus while driving is
because the springs are shot and there is a hole in my driver's seat.  I'm
afraid if I ever redo the seats, I'll sit too high and have to cut a space
bubble viewing port in the roof so I can see.  I might have to tack it on
with some bark brown silicone and pop rivets. :-)
