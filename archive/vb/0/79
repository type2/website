  Hello List,
  
  Has anyone ever had to fix/replace the pin in the door hinges?  I have a 61
 
  panel that the lower door hinge pin is broken.  The top one is fine and 
  would like to leave that one alone.  Is there any easy way to get the old 
  pin out without drilling it out?  Where do you find a replacement pin?
  
  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
  Thanks
  Mike
  
 Replacing the pin is a bitch without the tools. One needs a modified "C"  
 clamp to get the old pin out. My hand's building one right now. I believe 
 replacements are available at RMMW. I'll let you know the status of the tool
 
 after it is built.

Rocky Mountain Motorworks.  They have pins for 46-79 bugs, which should fit 
busses. They cost $4.95 to $6.25, depending on whether you want one that is 
used for mirror mounting. RMMW's phone no. is 1-800-258-1996.
