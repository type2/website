Subject: Re: [VB] Dead mouse removal?

I want you guys to be careful when playing with dead mice, their remains,
their nests, and especially their dried fecal matter.  The Hanta virus has
killed people - it got a guy last year in Lincoln, NE.

Although rare, prevention rather easy.  Read all about it at:

If I have to paw through dust and dirt, I wear a dust mask.  And even though
I know this isn't a VW topic'd post, I think enough of us to junkyarding
that it warrants mention.
