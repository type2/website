Subject: Thanks for the help! - Horn wire fiasco

Thanks for the encouargement and the tips. You were right, just push the
wire through. I had to get over the "new bus" thing, and get it done. The
best I can tell is that the mystery beercan piece is the exact diameter of
the blinker switch and looks to be a small piece of one. Misc trash I guess.
The woodruff key was "spare parts" that some one accidently let fall in the
shaft. I checked and the one at the steering wheel is still there. Lesson
learned?
- The steering shaft is hollow. The slot on the outside of the shaft for the
woodruff key goes through to the inside. Do it wrong and the key falls down
the shaft. Some poor bloke may find it later.
- The list was right. Pretty easy. Now I need the set screw for the horn cap
ground wire connection.
