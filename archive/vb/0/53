 Hello List,
 
 Has anyone ever had to fix/replace the pin in the door hinges?  I have a 61 
 panel that the lower door hinge pin is broken.  The top one is fine and 
 would like to leave that one alone.  Is there any easy way to get the old 
 pin out without drilling it out?  Where do you find a replacement pin?
 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.
 Thanks
 Mike
 
Replacing the pin is a bitch without the tools. One needs a modified "C"  
clamp to get the old pin out. My hand's building one right now. I believe 
replacements are available at RMMW. I'll let you know the status of the tool 
after it is built.
