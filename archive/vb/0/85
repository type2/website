Subject: 1956 logo'ed front windshields for trade and truck canvas

Well don't get two excited just yet, I was talking to a friend of mine that
is in the process of making me a new tilt canvas for my crew cab and
discussing the progress on her 56 panel that she has. While I was looking
over the 40,000 mile beast I noticed that the front windshields were the
original logo'ed ones with no chips and no fogging. She is wanting to
restore the bus to a very nice weekend driver not a 100 point concourse bus.
I told her she should consider trading the front glass for aftermarket
glass and other parts she needs. One of the parts being the tail lights.
if there is interest in this type of trade please send an email to me and I
will forward it on to her. I guess she can contact you afterwards if she is
interested. What else does she need? I am not completely sure as alot of the
parts have been removed and are in her garage with here husbands bug. She
is in the central Washington area.

In regards to the canvas she is making I gave her my original canvas to use
as a pattern. her work is excellent so far and she is planning on offering
them soon for sale. As soon as I get it from her I will post very detailed
pictures of it so everyone can see the quality of work she does.
