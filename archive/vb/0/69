Subject: RE: [VB] Dead mouse removal?

Interesting cunundrum, what does your Bentley say? I 
would not want to drive a boubonic-plague-mobile so here 
are my suggestions:

1) Since the assumed-room-temperature rodent is 
organic...Liquid plumber?

or 

2) Get a big, fat, strong rat that will just fit through 
your ankle warmer kick vent. Insert said rat into vent 
followed by the business end of a blow torch. Rat runs 
down tube to escape flame and pushes the aforementioned 
obstruction down the tube and out the end into waiting 
cage. Toss nasty cage into the nearest body of water and 
go wash your hands.

This can also be combined with the vacuum idea if you 
think your rat is too wimpy.
