Subject: The Planet comes through

   Again my thanks to Everett and The Planet.  Posted that I was looking for
a STEEL side step (for a reasonable price) and had one in a day. Just goes
to show that a lot of lurkers watch his ads THEY DO WORK. Now if anybody
would come up with 2 Westy Clamshell light holders and a Lens (again for a
reasonable price), I would be a happy camper (no pun intended). Have parts,
new, used, NOS for trade.
