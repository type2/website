Subject: Re My New 21 Window Bus!

Hello Everyone

    Before the list went down I was in the process of picking up my new 21
window bus. A lady at work told me that there was one in town but because
her boyfriend wanted it she wouldn't tell me where it was. Well a couple
months go by and they are no longer an item anymore so she told me where it
was and so I contacted the owner and he agreed to sell it to me for a very
good price. I am very happy that I was able to get one of these busses they
are getting very hard to find at a good price.

    I have one question I am looking for the information on these number or
a location where I can fine them. I can't remember where they were posted on
the web. The numbers are:

90    9
425 081 114 797
UH 2412 121783  5022675

Thanks in Advance!
