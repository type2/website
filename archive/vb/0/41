Subject: gear ratios + ext oil cooler questions ..

Dear list
I have a 67 single-cab .

1) are my final ratios 0.82 / 4.37 / 1.26 ??
2) If so I am planing to swap 4.125 , my current engine is a 1.6 single will 
it result worse ? I am not planing to load anything heavier than 500 kg 
(1100 pounds)
3) Did anyone try an external oil cooler adapter which mounts under the 
original oilcooler ?. If so does it serially add the external cooler after 
the original one or before it ?
4) The oil-temp seems to increase easly over 120 C ( 250 F) I am not feeling 
happy with it , is it normal ?
5) Can 0.82 4th gear be fitted to a bug ? my bug has 0.92 with 3.88 , 0.82 
can be cool with 1776 , 100 hp .

thanks for help
Eren
