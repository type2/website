Subject: De-Rustization & Body Repair

I have spent the last couple weeks disassembling the 21 window and Tuesday or 
Wednesday the real work will begin. Local cool guy Dave Sweinhagen will be 
repairing the rust and body damage from the top down. Repair the skylights, 
windshield frames, passenger dogleg thats been bondoed (is that really a 
word?) over, section in rear corners rom my 67 kombi, repair a couple pillars 
and a few other things. He will be doing the cutting, welding and grinding 
while i follow behind doing the sanding and finishing. Luckily all this work 
fell under my budget so maybe just maybe the bus will be on the road in a few 
more weeks.

I just bought a new spray gun. A binks 2001 to use once the body is finished. 
I have a 62 beetle shell out back that I wil be using to kind of practice on 
with my dad. He used to paint for a really long time before i was born so 
this will be a refresher for him.

I'll take lots of pictures for those who care of the sandblasting, body work, 
the home-made spray booth using a nice negative air unit here from work and 
the spraying once it all gets under way.
