I think that's probably right.  The pic at http://www.supernet.net/~jclark/vw/pitch/p_erect.html (see "Point C") is probably the closest thing to a spec I've seen.  
You want to be able to reach the 'nut' on the back.  The upright pole from the bumper to the side frame can be adjusted to fine-tune the length.  I used to have one 
of these tents mounted on a 68 Westy and it worked fine even mounted to that.
