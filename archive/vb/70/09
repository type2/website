Subject: Re: [VB] front spindles - stiff front end problem close to solved

Dave the bushing has a groove around the outside, the grease should go thru 
it if it isn't really dried up. The bushings will knock out with a big hammer 
and a socket. the late 63 bus spindles are a one year only item, I think 22 
mm link pins, the early ones are 20 mm. Doug Lewis
