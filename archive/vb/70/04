You can buy these off the shelf in Germany.  Apparently it is standard 
procedure there to use these on stranded wires.  I don't know if these
are brass or not - they look to be bright plated if they are:

If those links don't work, go to http://www.conrad.de and navigate to 
Steckverbinder -> Kabelverbinder -> Aderendhuelsen .  They cost about
$1-$2 per pack of 100.
