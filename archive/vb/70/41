Subject: RE: [VB] valve noise on new rebuild 1600 sp engine

did i miss something? were the heads rebuilt or are they new? i don't
remember seeing the original post mentioning one way or the other.
why even bother with rebuilt heads when the cost of new ones is minimally
more than rebuilt?
if they are rebuilt, were the seats cut too deeply? were the guides
replaced (as mentioned)? are the adjusters/rocker arms in proper
alignment/geometry?
