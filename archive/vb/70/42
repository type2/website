Subject: Front engine compartment seal

I'm putting a new front engine compartment seal in the '65 Single Cab before
the engine goes in.  Never used the early type before.  Which way does the
lip go?  Pointing up or down?  Pointing up gives a smooth installation
around the curves.  Pointing down looks a little like ruffles around the
curves.  Bentley doesn't even show the seals except for how the rear seal
fits around the sheet metal cylinder tin and rear tin (breast plate?).  Any
pics to be sure?  Also can replacement seal track be purchased through any
sources?

Thanks,

Thomas
