Subject: Re: [VB] Battery weirdness....

If the points were closed for the battery discharge hours then they maybe welded shut or burnt  (also this may have destroyed the coil )
Now the battery sounds internally shorted due to age and/or the heavy discharge. That will cause the clicking sound coming from the charger, and the needle is swinging wildly. Just like shorting the two leads together on the charger.
