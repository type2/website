Subject: Bus wanted central NC

Hey y'all
A friend has finally seen the light and wants to rejoin the VW fold but with
a bus this time.  He's looking for a weekender, preferably with child cot
but I can make one for him if there isn't one.  He needs it running, no
major problems, can spend around $2k and is in the central NC area.  Chris
would make a good bus owner so if you know of one, p-mail me and I'll get
the info to him.
Thank you very much.
Dave Jersey
