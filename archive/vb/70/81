Subject: speedometer calibration

Rebuilt my speedometer last night but I guess I put it back together
wrong because it now reads maybe 5-10mph less than the actual speed.
What determines the calibration, is it the position of the needle on
the splined shaft, the winding of the spring, or something else
entirely? Just got the thing back in and now I have to pull it again.
Aaargh! Looks good though...
