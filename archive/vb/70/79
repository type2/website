Mine is on the passenger side and it looks like a dealer hole. I had to
squirt some silicone sealant around the inside beacause of water leaks.

Is there a "correct" location for a radio antenna, or were they just
installed wherever the dealership felt like that day? I see them most
often either center of the nose emblem or on the passenger side of the
nose, any good reason to pick one location over the other?
Thanks,
