Subject: RE: [VB] valve noise on new rebuild 1600 sp engine

did you run-in the engine for 20+ minutes at a varying speed above idle to
harden/break in the cam/lifters?
i had a new cam go flat on me which chewed up the cam, lifters, piston
rings, and all bearings. the symptoms were perpetually loosening valves and
really bad loose valve noise all the time. i'd adjust them and within a
very short time, they'd be rattling angain. 
i got about 1k out of the engine before it required total re-rebuild. 
this may be a radical suggestion, but it may be happening.
anyway, good luck.
