Subject: RE: [VB] front spindles - stiff front end problem close to solved

I had the same issue, concerns aboput the 'hole' and the grease fitting.
I was refurbishing/rebuilding OE 66 spindles, lucky enough I was reusing
all the parts. Did a soak in thinner, and used a pressure grease gun to
blow out and check each fitting, completely disasemmbled (but no with
bushing pressed out), got out nasty grease, recleaned the bores,
regreased, and assembled. The hole doesn't have to line up, as long as
grease gets around. Pumping it through disassembled to check, clean,
flush out the old crap worked well for me, also gave clean grease to
prelube to assemble.
Since you have wasted (maybe?) needle bearings, you would need new
bushings anyway to match, so you have the change to line them up real
well, I imagine, mine were all very close from factory (guess they had a
good day).
*I agree, don't drill.
I know 63's had a lot of specific parts, but am no help on brake
happiness and spindle fits. I do recommend double checking the shimming,
and replacing any bushings that the needle bearing is toast on. If they
are good, make sure not to move them around, or they wonj't be good
long.
You might want to do (rebush, replace) all of them, but I know that is a
lot more work.

 After cleaning the passenger side and getting the spindle and backing
plate
 on I try and fit the drum. No go.....doesn't friggen' fit. Ok I check
my
 parts manual to see if the spindle was the same. Parts manual says so.
Check
 the 1963 factory workshop manual, looks the same except there's a
difference
 between the 1200 and 1500 transporter. Not sure how that's gonna make a
diff
 in my bus. Maybe it's the 63 1year only spindle deal.
.................... if you have a 63 1 ton, you have 1 year only
spindles, that take the earlier
links, but later drums.  dont think the fronts have special drums for 1
ton,
just the back.  But the 62 drums will not fit the 62 1 ton spindles.
think a
64-67 drum would.  If you have the 1 ton front end and one ton rear, why
not
keep it?  better brakes.

 So I figure I oughta check my old spindles that came off the bus to see
if
 they can be salvaged. All the needle bearings happen to be frozen on
both
 sides. Link pins came right out and looked good. King pins were nice
and
 tight. Grease looked terrible in the needle bearing and had dried up or
gone
 bad. So, now I'm soaking the bearing in lacquer thinner to see how
they'll
 clean up. Looking good after 20 minutes of soaking.

 The next problem and this is where it gets tricky. I'm cleaning out all
the
 grease fittings and checking the hols to make sure they get grease. In
the
 upper grease hole on the spindle the needle bearing bushing is not
lined up
 with the hole for the grease fitting.
 Other than sending the spindle out is there an easy way to get the
bushing
 out of the spindle or can I drill a hole in the bushing to allow grease

 access to the needle bearing.
  >>
there is a groove on the outside of the bushing that the grease runs
through.
 the workshop manual says you dont have to line the holes up.  The
groove
lets the grease around to the hole to get to the needle bearings, so you

don't need to line things up. if you really want to you can tap it out
(socket and rubber mallet, but you have to line up the bushing to the
spindle
just right exactly straight or the bushing tilts and won't go in.  Or
you can
stick the zerk back on and pump the old crud through .  Voila!

 Drilling is a bad idea as you don't want a rough end at the bottom of
he
drill hole scraping the needle bearings.
