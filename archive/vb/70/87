Subject: Re: [VB] Strainers-Magnet/bumper/etc.

I found an NOS sold by vw in the box-with-all-the-cool-logoes-on-it round  
magnet that sits on the sump plate under the screen.  It came with a nifty 
spring to keep it in place.  It was the 25/36hp version, and is in my 53, but 
I am sure they sold the 40hp/1500/1600 size too.  

but a filter might be better, if you use a filter with a relief spring :)  
the kinds of filter pump readily available cannot be used with a stock 
muffler nor in a later bus that takes the engine brace.  The mystery motor in 
my 65 has a (Shock! Horror!) header on it, and so it sounds annoyingly not 
like a stock muffler.  But the oil filter pump fits.  Maybe the dist doesn't 
advance either, that would make it not sound right.    I think a floor mat 
would help quiet the road noise down.  hm.  I successfully drove it today, 
but will wait until the weekend so I can tinker a bit more.

my 65 came to me with a slash front with the tent mount on it, which 
indicates it was the original.   deluxe trim would have indicated it was not 
original to that bus.  this 65 did not have a rear bumper when I got it.   I 
have seen pics of new 65s with slash front and back, and also with slash 
front and pointy back.  I think the pointys were later 65s.    But either 
fits.  A lot of people chimed in on this topic!   Mine wore a john muir 
special slash rear for a while, then I acquired a nice straight pointy rear 
that came from a deluxe -it does not have the trim but has the holes.  Dunno 
what the bus came with when new.
