Subject: RE: [VB] gas in oil

i don't think the flange will be the solution to your gas-in-oil. more
thanlikely the fuel pump diaphragm.
as to getting the piece out of the case, do it carefully. i have had to run
a tap into it, grab onto the tap with a vice-grip, and hammer on the vice
grip. sometimes this works, other times it breaks. it really is a
hit-and-miss situaion.
just be sure to get the really big chunks, and if you notice a piece has
fallen in the case, run it and then change the oil and remove the screen to
get it out. \good luck, been there a few times.
