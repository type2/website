Subject: Re: [VB] Tire Size for IRS Conversions?

Stock height IRS conversion with '79 bus parts
14" wheels from '79 bus  5 x 112 bolt pattern front and back
Tires 205/75R14  load rating 1532 lbs / 695 kg

Not that you asked, but ff you do an IRS conversion, IMHO stay away from the kits that use bug parts.  Go for the ones that use parts from later
Bays.
