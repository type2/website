Subject: 70 westy brochure with tent set-up instructions

I am posting this to both air-cooled bus lists because when camping there 
seems to be a significant number of bay window westy tents with splitties.
I had not put the tent up for a year so was really glad to have the manual a 
Lake Havasu. Thus I have put up the westy brochure from my 70 westy on my 
literature page.

If Thom or Everett want to move it that is fine by me.
