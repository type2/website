I run the cow magnet strapped to the pick-up tube, but you have to run a
deep sump with added pickup tube.  I have also used the magnet type I
think Harry is talking about.  It's a ring magnet, ceramic covered that
just fits inside the strainer plate nuts and around the drain plug.  I
would pry the magnet off with a big screwdriver at oil change time.  They
are really strong magnets.  After loosing two cams in one engine I have
seen that it can help.  I had a fram HP1 full flow filter the first time
and the bearings were trashed, crank needed polished.  The second time the
cam/lifters were much worse, but running a K&N 3002 filter the bearings were
perfect.  Both times the cow magnet had lots of metal sticking out on it
so it did what it could.  Filters are better than magnets in my opinion,
but I figure use any thing that helps.
