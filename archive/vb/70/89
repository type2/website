Hey all,

I'm finally getting into the '65 Kombi that I just bought, doing the =
tune-up, valves, all that good stuff. I found that the coil was just =
putting out a wimpy orange spark at the dizzy wire, so I figured I'd get =
a new one since it looks like the original coil. While I was in there, =
though, I checked the resistance of the coil-to-dizzy wire and found it =
to be 5K ohms. This seems awfully high for a 6" wire with no resistor =
cap. Is it time for a new wire? I then checked resistance in the #2 =
spark plug wire and found it to be 2K ohms (all the way to the cap), =
which doesn't surprise me for a sparkplug wire. My BMW motorcycle (also =
aircooled) specifies 5K Ohm resistance in the sparkplug wires (actually, =
the resistor is in the cap), and I was wondering if there is also a =
standard for VWs. Anyone, anyone.....
