 I started to root thru my daughters stuff to see if I could 'McGuiver' a
 solution.  I came across a roll of duct tape in one of the boxes.  I used 2
 3 inch pieces of tape and covered the hole.  I drove it 15 miles to her new
 house and back home; it drove as if there never was a problem.

I though the factory solution was to file a dime, or pfennig,  smaller to fit 
the hole and then JB weld it in place (be artsy and let the face of the coin 
show.)
