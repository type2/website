Hey all,

I have kind of a weird problem. I accidently discharged the 6V battery =
in my '65 Kombi. The PO rigged some heavy wire and a toggle switch on =
the column to send power straight to the coil. So, basically when you =
turn on the engine, the key only starts the engine; on and off to the =
coil is controlled by the toggle switch. He explained that he did it =
because he found only 3.5 volts at the coil and figured the wires must =
have built up resistance over the years. ANYWHOOO....that's not the =
problem. The problem is that I forgot to leave that extra toggle switch =
off last night, so the coil just sat there merrily charged up all night =
long waiting for the distributor to tell it when to fire. At least =
that's what I'm figuring, because all of a sudden the battery is totally =
dead today. Now here's the weird thing: I figured, "hell, I have a =
charger, and it's got a position for 6V, so that'll fix everything" =
Right? I hook up the battery, out of the car, and it's doing it's thing. =
Fifteen minutes later, I hear a clicking sound coming from the charger, =
and the needle is swinging wildly back and forth, like it can't figure =
out if the battery is completely charged or completely discharged. It's =
rated to charge 6V at 6 amps. Is that too much, too little? Is the =
battery totally fried? It's a pretty new battery, and was working fine =
up until today. Are there any tests that I can run to determine if it's =
the battery or the charger? I used the charger just last weekend on my =
friend's '71 (12V of course) and it worked great. Any clues? Anyone, =
Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?....

sorry for the lengthy explanation. comments on more successful solutions =
to "high resistance over the years" also welcome. I am planning to get =
in there at sand all of my grounds clean; recently got the bus, and =
haven't had a chance yet.

thanks!!

'63 Standard
'65 Kombi
maybe tomorrow I'll add a '77 Westy!!

hmmm....anything I should know/be aware of when checking out a '77 Westy =
to buy? It's the original owner and the guy gave away the sink, fridge =
and stove!! Grr.... good price though....
