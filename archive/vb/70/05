First off, take a look at the '66 _Bug_ wiring diagram at 
http://www.vintagebus.com/wiring/bug-65+66.jpg .  I think this is the
closest diagram there is to what you have.  Clara is right in that
there is no Bus diagram specific to the '65 one-speed self-parking
wiper motor, she schooled me on this before.  :)

You only have three wire ends, right?  Here's what I'd try to sort out 
which wire is which.  First go back in the back and disconnect the thin
wire between the distributor and the coil so you won't melt your coil
fooling around if the points are closed.   Back up front, get a test
light and ground one end.  Turn on the key, and try the other end on
each of the three ends you have in turn.  One of them (probably the
one with two wires in one connector) should light the light.  This is
the power wire.  Now touch the power wire to each of the other two
wires in turn.  One of the other two wires should make the motor run
for as long as you hold the wires together - hold the wires together
long enough for the wipers to make a couple of complete sweeps.  This
is the wire to the motor windings.  The other wire will do nothing for
most positions of the wiper blades, but when they are parked, it will
make the motor run for just a second and shut off.  This is the park
switch wire.  Once you're done, turn the key off.

Now that you've figured out what each of the three wires do, hook them
up to the switch.  Plug the power wire on to 54.  Plug the motor winding
wire onto 54d.  Plug the park switch wire on to 31b.  Mount the switch
in the dash (for ground), turn the key back on, and try it out!  When
you're happy, don't forget to hook the wire back up at the distributor.

If you have four wire ends it's a little more interesting.  Post back
if you do and I'll see what I can find.

Clara, if you or anyone else with a '65 with the original one speed 
self parking wiper motor can send me the details of the hookup, I will
draw a nifty color wiring diagram and put it up on the Web for all.
This question seems to come up every few months so I figure it would
help.
