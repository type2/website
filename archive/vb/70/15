Fifteen minutes later, I hear a clicking sound coming from the charger, and the needle is swinging wildly back and forth, like it can't figure out if the battery is completely charged or completely discharged. It's rated to charge 6V at 6 amps. Is that too much, too little? Is the battery totally fried? It's a pretty new battery, and was working fine up until today. Are there any tests that I can run to determine if it's the battery or the charger? I used the charger just last weekend on my friend's '71 (12V of course) and it worked great.

6V & 6amps sounds like you may be overtaxing the charger and its having a bit of a hard time.  don't know what type of overcurrent protection the charger has, but I wouldn't be surprised if that is the troublemaker.  I would expect that a fully discharged 6V battery to draw far in excess of 6 amps.

You could just leave it connected and after a while the battery will get some charge and the charging rate will reduce more in line with what the charger can provide.  Keep an eye on the charger and if it feels like its getting too hot to touch, unplug it, let it cool down and then resume the charging cycle.  Eventually you should get a full charge on it.

Oh yea,  don't forget to open that ignition coil switch.
