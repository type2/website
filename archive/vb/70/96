Later Bay parts here. Rear weld-in IRS with wolfgang flip spindles on
the front. 195/50-15 or 195/60-14... Speedo is off (see related post)
but otherwise it's great!

Stock height IRS conversion with '79 bus parts
14" wheels from '79 bus  5 x 112 bolt pattern front and back
Tires 205/75R14  load rating 1532 lbs / 695 kg

Not that you asked, but ff you do an IRS conversion, IMHO stay away from
the kits that use bug parts.  Go for the ones that use parts from later
Bays.
