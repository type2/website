Hi Ric,
Well the heads should have been re/built well enough that the valve heads and 
seats did not need any wear to seal/seat properly.  Also if the engine is 
running hot especially during warm weather and # 3 cylinder valves the valve 
stems will stretch causing too tight of valve lash.  As for getting loose 
valve lash the wear going on between the lobes of the cam and the cam 
followers will do that.  Just get up twenty minutes early and adjust the 
valves before going to work or at least if the weather is good after work in 
the parking lot.
