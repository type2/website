I've not seen a magnetic screen, but I have experimented with magnetic
plugs.  You have to get (or make) a very flat plug or otherwise it will
interfere with the oil screen structure.  I've found very little junk
adhered to the magnetic plug, probably because most of the sliding
surfaces in an engine are non-magnetic.  Now if they made an aluminum
magnet...
