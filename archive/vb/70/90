Subject: Re: [VB] Another Speedo Calibration Question

If you look on the back of the speedo you will see a stamped number
that isn't the part number and isn't the manufacture date. Mine is
0.77, which means calibrated (before I screwed it up) for 15" wheels.
There also exists a 0.8 for 14" wheels. Putting one of these 14"
calibrated speedometers on your bus with the small 15" might give you
a reading "closer" to the "truth". But knowing how to adjust the
reading would be better. Clearly it can be changed because it seems I
did it when I didn't mean to...

Well well,

Today looks like my day to piggyback on everyone elses threads.

I have a lowered bus with 195/50-15 tires and the speedometer reads
about 5-10mph faster than I'm travelling. Some research reveals that
stock tires (6.4-15) are 25.7" tall and mine are 22.6", which is a 12%
reduction in total height.

It appears to be possible to alter the speedo, but can it be done
reliably? I do like the false sense of speed that I get while driving
"70" in my bus, but would prefer that the odometer be a bit more
reliable for servicing, etc.

Thanks,

~Rich
