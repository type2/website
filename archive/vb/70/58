Subject: 79+  009?

I was browsing the aircooled.net site, and came upon the 79+ vanagon 009...
john says that if used with the proper 'box' from a vanagon, ANY upright
can use the dizzy.

anyone done this? difficulty in splicing in box? hard-to-find parts or
pricey?  difference in drivability?

they make the claim that this setup is better than a pertronix.......
