 After cleaning the passenger side and getting the spindle and backing plate 
 on I try and fit the drum. No go.....doesn't friggen' fit. Ok I check my 
 parts manual to see if the spindle was the same. Parts manual says so. Check 
 the 1963 factory workshop manual, looks the same except there's a difference 
 between the 1200 and 1500 transporter. Not sure how that's gonna make a diff 
 in my bus. Maybe it's the 63 1year only spindle deal.
....................
if you have a 63 1 ton, you have 1 year only spindles, that take the earlier 
links, but later drums.  dont think the fronts have special drums for 1 ton, 
just the back.  But the 62 drums will not fit the 62 1 ton spindles.  think a 
64-67 drum would.  If you have the 1 ton front end and one ton rear, why not 
keep it?  better brakes.

 So I figure I oughta check my old spindles that came off the bus to see if 
 they can be salvaged. All the needle bearings happen to be frozen on both 
 sides. Link pins came right out and looked good. King pins were nice and 
 tight. Grease looked terrible in the needle bearing and had dried up or gone 
 bad. So, now I'm soaking the bearing in lacquer thinner to see how they'll 
 clean up. Looking good after 20 minutes of soaking.
 
 The next problem and this is where it gets tricky. I'm cleaning out all the 
 grease fittings and checking the hols to make sure they get grease. In the 
 upper grease hole on the spindle the needle bearing bushing is not lined up 
 with the hole for the grease fitting.
 Other than sending the spindle out is there an easy way to get the bushing 
 out of the spindle or can I drill a hole in the bushing to allow grease 
 access to the needle bearing.
  >>
there is a groove on the outside of the bushing that the grease runs through. 
 the workshop manual says you dont have to line the holes up.  The groove 
lets the grease around to the hole to get to the needle bearings, so you 
don't need to line things up. if you really want to you can tap it out 
(socket and rubber mallet, but you have to line up the bushing to the spindle 
just right exactly straight or the bushing tilts and won't go in.  Or you can 
stick the zerk back on and pump the old crud through .  Voila! 

 Drilling is a bad idea as you don't want a rough end at the bottom of he 
drill hole scraping the needle bearings.
