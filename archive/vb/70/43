I have heard that tourqing the heads of a new rebuild is very important at
about 500 miles on the rebuild, but since you said you only have about 200
miles on it, it probably isn't that...unless the torque specs on the heads
were wrong to begin with.  I dont know for sure, but compression ratio may
have some to do with heads loosening up.  I had a 1776cc in my '56 bug
with high compression ratio and those heads seemed to be always loose, but
it ran hot also.
