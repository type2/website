Subject: Re: valve noise on new rebuild 1600 sp eng

Hi Ric
Were these new or rebuilt heads?  I've had heads where it took a little
while for the seats to settle in, the valves get worn into the seats, and
all the places that rub wore until they got acquainted.  All these little
wears add up.  Another thing to ask is when are you going to do the retorque
on the heads?  I've had heads get loose after 200 miles.  Checking the lower
studs is easy, if they're loose drop the engine for a proper retorque.
Which side didn't need the adjust?  was it the side that sounds louder?
