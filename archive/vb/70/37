Subject: Re: [VB] Front Shocks????

We got it straighten out.  I had order form online.  After a few calls with
them on Friday I noticed in the print mag that they had made a correction on
numbers.  Turns out somewhere in the past they must have caught this.  Just
not straight on the webpage.  Simple mistake, they sending out the correct
shocks and reimbursing me for shipping the others back.  Can't ask for
anything else.  Got to expect some mistakes along the way I guess.
