Subject: Re: [VB] resistance question


I'm finally getting into the '65 Kombi that I just bought, doing the tune-up,
valves, all that good stuff. I found that the coil was just putting out a wimpy
orange spark at the dizzy wire, so I figured I'd get a new one since it looks
like the original coil. While I was in there, though, I checked the resistance
of the coil-to-dizzy wire and found it to be 5K ohms. This seems awfully high
for a 6" wire with no resistor cap. Is it time for a new wire? I then checked
resistance in the #2 spark plug wire and found it to be 2K ohms (all the way to
the cap), which doesn't surprise me for a sparkplug wire. My BMW motorcycle
(also aircooled) specifies 5K Ohm resistance in the sparkplug wires (actually,
the resistor is in the cap), and I was wondering if there is also a standard for
VWs. Anyone, anyone.....

You should have solid core wires with a resister end on the plug connecter.

But then again, you have a 65. It may be different then a 66 or 67 or any other
bus.....
