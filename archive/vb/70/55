Subject: 1961 Bus for Sale

Hello All
I have a 1961 Bus for Sale it has been sitting around for a long time but it 
has much potential..no rust and it very straight.  It has it's rear wheel 
wells cut (you can get replacements for around $50 each side) and the inside 
panel where the spare has been cut (I have the piece).  Let me know if you 
are interested.  $3000
