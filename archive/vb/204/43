Subject: Foksy T2 front beam adjuster

Saw this with claims it has better ride than other front beam adjusters.

http://www.bluebird-type2.co.uk/  Click the "Parts" link for more info.

Just curious if anyone on the list has used them or has opinions about them.

p.s. I realize there are dropped spindles and other methods of lowering, 
and that not lowereing is prefered by some folks...so I don't need any 
explanations regarding those. Just looking for discussion on these 
adjusters versus the other adjusters available.
