Subject: BBB7 polar bear nightmare!

I figured this should wait until Friday =)

I am so friggin glad I slept in on Saturday morning...gotta love the Powercat 
heater and a warm bus =)

After taking a looksee at the pics of the so-called 'Polar Bear Club" I 
almost crapped my pants from laughing then had nightmares for the rest of the 
week!

Looking at the samba.com forum and ramva, it seems that Kyle has a new 
nickname of "Big Foot" haha  

I sure as help hope that was for a good cause......did they pay you guys to 
put your clothes back on?

All in fun....and I'll have to say.....I never realized how firm Johns ass 
was  = O

Had a great time...see y'all at OCTO
