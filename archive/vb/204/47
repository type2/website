Subject: Question for the PNW-ers...Wiper motor Q

Hey...

I just arrived here, South of Seattle in mid summer, when it was DRY.

Well...It is not so dry these days.  I would really like to have my wipers
up to par, and I am having problems that I haven't seen addressed as yet.

First off, I have a 63' panel, been running 12 volts since I have owned it.

My wipers are hooked up, AND WORK - sort of.  Here is my observation.  The
wipers are VERY slow.  There doesn't seem to be a voltage drop however,
which I find confusing.  They even stop often, like they don't have the
power to scrape the glass.  I can nudge them, and they continue on their
sweep.  The sweep is slower from Driver-to-Passenger side, and then pick up
a bit going the other direction.

I was wondering/hoping this would be some sort of procedure, like pulling
the wiper motor, and re-greasing it.  Looking for documentation, somewhere.
Is it in the Bentley?  Tips? Tricks?

Hopefully not a burnt motor..!
