Subject: Re: Mudflaps on Ebay

   This weekend I paid $100.00 for a set of new repo  VW mud flaps with "65"
on them, and I was happier then hell. It was at BBB7 and I bought $100.00
worth of raffle tickets and they are all I won. The big winners were the kids
of Lake Havasu. Thanks to all who came and had a great time at the new
location. Thanks again for supporting the event.  Report comes latter, still
kick'n back and resting. Haven't even unloaded anything yet, plan on that for
Wed after work. Got to rest up for the Sun. Super Bowl Party.
