Reminds me of a joke.  

Sven and Ollie enter a charity raffle.  Sven wins a case of 
spaghetti sauce, and Ollie wins a toilet brush.  A couple weeks
later, they run into each other.
"So, Sven, how was the spaghetti sauce?"  asks Ollie.
"Pretty good, actually.  How'd the toilet brush work out, Ollie?"
"Not so good Sven; I think I'm gonna go back to using paper." says Ollie
