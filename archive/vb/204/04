ah, but you can!  that crappy 'second chance' BS hung me up for a 
minute... but to email someone when ebay doesn't WANT you to, just go 
to their feedback page, or someone else'e page who left feedback FOR 
them.  you can then 'email an ebay member' from there.
ebay claims not to monitor this traffic, but who knows.

fwiw, most bidders assume you are simply trying to screw them ouuta 
the item, and that you are gonna bid last minute!! i have gotten some 
VERY nasty mails back from those i've tried to warn; gave up.
caveat ebayptor!!
