Subject: woman driver - bbb7 trip report

first off i want to say that there seems to be something about being a woman driver.  it's either something good or something bad, depending on interpretation and perspective.

jon and i left monterey for lake havasu thursday about 2pm.  we stopped the night at a rest stop outside of needles and arrived at lake havasu at about 11am.  during the approximate 560-mile drive jon's 1956 standard ran hot, refused to idle, shredded a fan belt and then refused to start at the rest stop.  His cleaning the carburetor (twice) rectified some of these problems.  my 1956 single cab preformed flawlessly.

for the return trip, our friend roger joined our caravan.  we left lake havasu sunday around 2pm.  we stopped the night at a hotel outside of bakersfield and arrived home at about 4:30pm.  during this part of the drive jon's 1956 standard blew the main seal and then the oil cooler seals.  we had to pull over about every 100 miles to let the oil drain out of the transmission bell housing so the clutch wouldn't get fouled.  roger's 1967 deluxe sliding door almost lost a heater box and then blew the same fuse, the one that brings electricity to the engine, over and over.  again my 1956 single cab preformed flawlessly.

there seems to be something about being a woman driver.  either my truck and i are an invincible combination eluding breakdown or the combination serves only to bring misfortune to others.  i have to admit that when my truck's turn signal started acting up i was almost relieved.

however one reads these events, i do know that i had a terrific time at bbb7 and already can't wait until bbb8!

cheers,
