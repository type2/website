Subject: Re: [VB] Mudflaps on Ebay

All I was saying by that statement (which I should have clarified), is that
take your choice.  No VW mudflaps, or the ones that RMMW is selling because
of a 'loophole'.  I'll take the RMMW ones over none.  Also them being made
out of old tires, well, at least they'll be good for about 40k miles if I
keep em rotated!
