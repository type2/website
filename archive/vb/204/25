Having to miss this show AGAIN because of work (F'ing pretentious
Hollywood award shows!), I need to hear some good stories of fun and
frivolity ...not to mention a runaway double cab or heater induced ass
burning story of some sort....John H. ;-)  The ones so far are starting
to dull the pain of missing that event AND Pomona in one weekend.  Keep
it up please.

Would any of the benevolent event organizers consider moving the date
forward or aft one weekend???   Sh!t, I'd even forgo working this
weekend down in SD just to get a chance to freeze my butt by the lake
for once.  You can take my place at the game.  I'll teach ya every thing
you need to know about a Betacam in 10 minutes ;-)

Glad everyone had a great time.  I'm jealous :-|
