Last week I posted a wanted ad on my site, the results were this:
o One person said a bug hood seal was the same:

or
http://wolfsburgwest.com/_securefolder/wwshowpn.asp?PN=3D113823731B
o One person said a Bug decklid seal was the same:
URL above
o One person said a Bug decklid seal was identical and the splash pan seal
only has a different part # because the length is different.

>Was looking at the swaps at BBB and i see this seal that my friend had.
 He says its bug, decklid seal. I took it over and compared it to a ribbed
bumper splash pan with og seal that had laying there, its exactly the same,
*identical*. So i say ok ill take it. He saw all this happen then all the
sudden he doesnt want to sell it to me?
