Maybe you should host a weekend of "tool time" for your fellow travelers.  It sounds like they could use a little refresher course on VW maintence! j/k

It could also just be a curse that Jon has. I seem to remember that stretch of highway eating  up another one of his motors.

The singlecab looks great with it's new paint, by the way.
