Subject: Want a real aluminum T1 alternative?

Check this out.  The T5 / oxy-boxer revolution.  Take a Vanagon wasserboxer 
and turn it into a T1 engine, amazingly simple operation.

I am working on one myself that will be a 2.1 air-cooler, but geared for 
torque and not high HP.

In my opinion a better solution than the cruddy AL T1 being imported and 
much easier than an upright T4 conversion.

Check it out,
Adrian
