Subject: Re: [VB] Question for the PNW-ers...Wiper motor Q

Most likely the motor and gear assembly needs to be cleaned and regreased.
While it is open, use some 600 grit silicon carbide paper to clean the
commutator, the copper (maybe black if dirty) segmented thing that the
carbon brushes rub against). I just had my 64 open, cleaned the commutator
and closed it up again. The grease was nice and soft and factory fresh
looking. Careful poping off the connector arms. Don't drop them behind. It
is a (-at-)#$%% to get them back out.
