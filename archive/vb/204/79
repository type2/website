Hi Kevin,
Station Wagon (All Models) 1956-66, Model #8332, BTU/Hr Output 20,000, Fresh 
Air Temp Range 70-190F, Volts 6, Currant Amps 10-11, Fuel Rate Gal/Hr. .3.
  About the only bad thing about this model is if you have a walk thru bus 
with the spare tire in the left rear position you have to cut out the spare 
wheel well out and plate it over.
