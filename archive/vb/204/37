I can tell you first hand that 14" port a walls are going to be next to 
impossible to find. For some reason Atlas will stopped making them. I 
sell port a walls regularly and can't get 14's through *anyone* right 
now.  I did find 2 sets of 14 x 2 about a week ago while moving things 
around. I posted them on Everetts site and sold them both, fast!!
