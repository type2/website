Subject: Mudflaps on Ebay

Seems like someone could get some pieces of real mudflaps from a truckstop
and some emblems off watercooled (useless) VW's and put together their own.
Angle iron or galvanized shelf brackets from Home Depot. This is a
disposable item, not the Holy Grail! Weren't there \X/ flaps made with
reflective metal pieces out there somewhere? You can get reflective address
numbers and even letters to make your own statement. Aren't buses a symbol
of non-conformity here in the U.S. both then and now? I'm tempted to make
some hula skirts like the UPS trucks are wearing!
