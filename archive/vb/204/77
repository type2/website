The sending units work either on6V or 12V, so you dont worry about the sender 
when the volts are diff.

Are you sure it's the sender?   easy test:
 un plug wire from push on connector on fuel sender (on top of tank, you are 
playing twister with th engine) and ground that wire to the body.   Secure it 
with an alligator clip.  go to the front an turn the key to on.  The guage 
should read full.  If not, the wiring and/or gauge are bad.  

I had to replace both sender and guage in my 65 to get it working.   Some say 
you need a 12V guage, but I've seen 6V ones work on 12V so I dunno.

 to be replaced as well.
  My question is this:
 Since it is a 6 volt gauge(?) Do I nee to replace it wiht a 12 volt gauge? I
 have found aftermarket sending unit/fuel gauge 12 volts units that are the
 same size as the 66 gauge, is this the way to go?
 Thanks
