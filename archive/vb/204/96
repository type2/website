This is the online SW manual http://vw.itgo.com/heater.html but contact Rick Taylor and buy the real deal from him at http://pages.prodigy.net/busbarn/southwind.html  

BusBarn(-at-)Prodigy.net 

This is the page to your specific heater http://vw.itgo.com/cgi-bin/i/b13.gif

You can convert these to 12v with a little thought or Rick may have the parts.

As said already SOP=Standard Operating Procedure.

Actually I do not have a walk thru. I was just trying to make sure it was
not for a bug...from what I understand you mount these things opposite the
battery location. Is it easy to convert these to 12V, if I ever convert my
bus to 12V?

What does SOP mean?

Thanks

That is an engine compartment mounted bus heater.The thing to look out for
on these units are rusted exhaust outlet on the burner and missing pieces of
duct work that connect to the body for the heated air.

I believe your bus is a walk thru and this means removing the spare tire
well and capping the hole.This is SOP as described in the SW install
instructions.
