Subject: BYOB - Are you Ready?

Hey everyone,

Now that the might BBB Weekend has passed, it's time to set your sights on 
April 12th!  Yes, we've been quiet lately, but BYOB is definitely happening 
again this year!  Currently, The Red Barn is still our location which means 
Friday night camping for all who are coming from out of town or who just 
want a night of busness before business begins Saturday!  More information 
will be coming your way in the following weeks...mark the date on the 
calendar and tune to this list for more info.  Or you can check out the 
webpage of the Silicon Valley Chapter of SV2s at

Now, I just need to sell my Bug and get back into a Bus by then!  ;)
-Taylor
