I am from the UK and lowering is pretty popular here - some people like
these others hate them.  I think the people that like mainly like them as
they are much easier to fit.
I can't see how these can give a better ride- you will have the two sets of
leaves working against each other.  
If you just rotate both sets of leaves the same amount, then the ride should
be similar.  However it is the shock absorbers that have the biggest effect
in reducing ride quality- beetle rear shocks are used a fair bit.
