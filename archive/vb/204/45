Subject: Hinge Covers

I have seen hinge covers for sale on thesamba a couple times recently.  I was not aware they even existed.  Does anyone know the history on these.  Are they for specific years, doors (high hinge)?  Were they an original accessory of some after market item?

Just curious.


Enjoy your day!
