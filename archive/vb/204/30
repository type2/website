I might go Sunday; I'll be (-at-) Sears Point for a DE/TT on Saturday..
The single solitary split sold, allegedly for $400.

I was one of the first to set foot in there the inaugural weekend;
there can't be much left unless you swing the 'bay' way 

<flamebait> 
'bay' meaning 'baywindow', not 'San Francisco' although some would argue
there's not much difference
