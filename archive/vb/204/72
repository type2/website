Subject: RE: [VB] more heat questions

That is an engine compartment mounted bus heater.The thing to look out for on these units are rusted exhaust outlet on the burner and missing pieces of duct work that connect to the body for the heated air.

I believe your bus is a walk thru and this means removing the spare tire well and capping the hole.This is SOP as described in the SW install instructions.
