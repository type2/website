There is another stash in Lander Wyoming. You can see it from the road as you
are coming into town from the north. The guy had a pile of 40hp motors and
misc. sheet metal along wit T1-T3 bodies. There was a 66 shorty I was
interested in but had no way to haul it to Worland.

I went the first two times they had it open - the lone slitty is gone
now,and the place is prety well picked over.  You might find some stuff if
you're into Bays or Super Beetles.  I did have one great score out there
the opening weekend - a complete Motorola "Big M" radio for my Oval.
