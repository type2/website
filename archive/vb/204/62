There is a 12 V conversion you can do with the armature from a Bug wiper
motor: http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/050535.html  If the motor
is still 6 V, the voltage drop could be at the motor, switch, or even at
the fuse box.  Or maybe somebody just hooked it up and let it rip.

The grease can get hard, or it can separate.  On mine, the oil was coming
out of the grease, running down the shaft, and fouling the commutator.
Just cleaning off the commutator helped a lot, but I went ahead and
repacked it with grease as well.  Check the pivots at the base of the
windshields too.

I wrote a little on re-greasing mine
http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/066882.html using inspiration
provided by Clara W.  http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/035645.html
and others.
