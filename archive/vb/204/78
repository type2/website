Subject: Bus and Bilstien + 944 Phones pics

Hey everyone,

Just wanted to follow up with some pictures of some of the things I have 
been blabbing about here lately.

Check out www.germanlook.com and head for the technical articles.  There you 
will find two different bus articles.  One for the Bilstien shocks install 
and one for the 15x7 Phones fitment.  The pictures do blow up as well so 
just click on them to see the bigger picture.

I am hitting the junkyard this weekend for short grease fittings though to 
elliminate the minor rub for good.  Annoying.

Enjoy,
Adrian
