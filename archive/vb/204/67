I am going to re-seal my son's 66 spltie's fuel tank.The sending unit needs
to be replaced as well.
 My question is this:
Since it is a 6 volt gauge(?) Do I nee to replace it wiht a 12 volt gauge? I
have found aftermarket sending unit/fuel gauge 12 volts units that are the
same size as the 66 gauge, is this the way to go?
Thanks
