Subject: re:6V bulb upsizing

I checked out the website you mentioned Eric & Barb...from the classic
garage.

I have soldered my fuse box, and my headlight switch(as per your
instructions in the past. I have not checked the voltage at my headlights
since I did the work, but they do appear brighter. If I were to switch to
these H-4 lights you are writing about, how would I insure no electrical
fires, wire melting etc...do I just check the voltage at the bulb, and if
there is not too much drop, then I should be ok? Also is the bulb advertised
a straight swap or would I need to make some modifications to my headlamp
assembly?

thanks
