Subject: Third wire on Generator where goes?

1600 DP, 12volt system.  On the generator there are
the two terminals that connect with wire to the
voltage regulator.  There is also a third screw on top
toward the front (front means front ;^) of the
gernerator where another wire attaches with a
ring-type connector.
Where does this third wire go to?  Does it just go to
a body ground???
