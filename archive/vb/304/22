You had better check that. I just pulled a failed thermostat last month
that, like all broken bellows thermostats, remained in the unexpanded
condition with the flaps closed. Only when the bellows fails in the
expanded condition and stays there does the flaps remain open.

When the thermostat bellows fails, it fails in the open position. They
are pretty failsafe devices.
