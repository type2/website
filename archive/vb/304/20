Mark, are you sure? An expanded thermostat actually pushes the flaps
OPEN to allow more cooling air around the cylinders. A broken bellows
will not expand thus the flaps will not open and the cylinders and heads
WILL overheat. The spring on the flaps lever in front of the fan shroud
is designed to hold the flaps closed and the heated EXPANDING thermostat
forces them open.

I have also had thermostats that expand too rapidly when the engine is
only partially warm and allow cooling air in too soon causing the engine
to not come up to temp properly and lesson their lives.

Hello Guys  Let me throw my 2 cents in here I have seen therostats that
had
overheated so bad that they were bellowing out of their bracket, when
this
happens the flaps will end up in the close postion and can overheat the
motor
,which was already over heated
