Is that complete, everything up to the wind wing tab?

    I just recieved an order from WW and am pleased to announce that
they have made a beautiful reproduction wing vent latch. These are
avaiable in chrome and black!. Even thouh they are not really correct
for a bus a little ginding on the tip and you have a beautiful well made
wing vent latch that should last as long as you own your bus.
