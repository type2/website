This is a good idea in general as it will help any headlight shine more
brightly.

The stock sealed beams were 40/50 W.  The H4 bulbs are available in 55/60 W,
80/100 W, and 100/130 W.  In other words, you're running at somewhere
between 30 W (2.5 A) and 120 W (10 A) more than stock on low beam.  30 W
more is probably fine; 120 W more may cause you problems.

For far more than you wanted to know about it, see
