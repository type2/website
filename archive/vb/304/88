Subject: Re: [VB] 6v bulb upsizing

Good question

I believe they have 6V halogens.   I have the 12V halogens in my 61, they fit 
just like the regular bulbs and give bunches more light.

Hi guys,
Is there a way of upsizing from the standard 6v bulbs to more powerful ones?
It's easy in a 12v bus or bug but I'd imagine that that sourcing more 
powerful 6v bulbs is an issue.  Has anyone tried it?   Do any of the big shops sell 
them?
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
