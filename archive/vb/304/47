Subject: Burnt bus fund

     A nice lady named Chris Graue was on her way to Buses by the Bridge
VIII and had her bus catch on fire and burn to the ground. She was traveling
with her 2 children when this happened. Chris and the children are all OK
except for the trauma of loosing a lot of the stuff you own. This bus was
her only means of transportation and she is now wheeless. Not good with 2
children and living in the midwest with the snow cold and all.
    So far a couple people have offered her a car to use till she gets
another bus.
    
   At BBB VIII we are going to have an auction to raise money for her, we
have had a couple items donated so far
1. GOLD VW pendent with a diamond in the middle, donated by Teddy Bear
Finesman
2. Silver  VW pendent and chain donated by the Feitelson family (owners of
Old Volks/type2parts.com)

   We hope to raise enough money to get Chris another bus and to help
replace all of her lost items


thanks to all   ronnie
