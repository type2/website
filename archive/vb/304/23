Subject: Thermostat revisited

OOPS, sorry people, I opened my mouth when the brain wasn't engaged. You
shouldn't ever type technical stuff when holding a conversation with
other people on a totally different subject.

The spring and the lever in front of the fan housing holds the flaps
OPEN. It's the unexpanded thermostat bellows that holds the flaps closed
when the engine is cold. If your thermostat fails because of a cracked
bellows and does not expand then your flaps will remain closed. If your
thermostat over expands and the bellows wrinkle keeping it expanded then
the flaps will be open.

Sorry for the foul up. I will go stand in the corner and take a time
out.

Bernoulli Interval: Do I really have enough data to draw a valid
conclusion ?
