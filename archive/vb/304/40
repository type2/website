So that's where my original ended up?! ;-)

Ray,  I just bought a new thermostat for the bus from Gene Berg. They no
longer are supplying the bellows type, and sent me this funny contraption
made of brass, with a large open spring type thingee, terminated in the
usual hardware for the bracket and rod. Are you familiar with this new
thing?
