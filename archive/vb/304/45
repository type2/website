the defective thermostats I've seen have failed in the open position, which 
would keep the flaps pushed open.

I clean them, then test them before installing them (drop in pan of hot 
water, see if they expand, then contract when pulled out of the hot water)   All 
the bad ones I found seemed to be permantly expanaded, I didn't find any that 
would stay closed.

Hello Raymond    The one that I had that overheated so bad had bellowed 
completely out of the bracket so that it had pulled the flaps closed, this
