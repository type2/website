Hi Michael,

It's been a really long time, but lemmee see... the replacement bulbs are
small bayonet style, bulb with metal shoulder and body, which implies that
they fit a bayonet hole. The original lamps are sealed full lamps, and fit
into the standard VW bucket. Hmmm.... let me check outside....

The H4's fit into a hemispherical half-dome that has fits into the back of
the bucket, replacing the standard lamp, and has a bayonet bulb opening in
the center, for the H4.

It was offered to me that it may have been a standard part for Vanagons,
or some other later VW van. I don't recall where I got them, but it could
have been at a large VW show, like the Classic, or Kelly Park. Back in
the mid-90s.

That's all I can say at this point. Try checking with WW, or Ronnie in AZ
on the list, or Bus Depot, also on the list.

Good hunting!
