Is there a way of upsizing from the standard 6v bulbs to more powerful ones?
Hi Andy,
There are H-4 55/60W 6 volt bulbs out there for sale.  We have used H-4s, but 
requires having the light switch and fuse box soldered to prevent burning 
these items out with heat from loose connections and corrosion resistance.  Once 
that is done our 1963 SC has nice white bright headlights!
