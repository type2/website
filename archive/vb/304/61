Subject: Need artwork for EveryBus shirts

Howdy. With Everybus around the corner, I'm getting the final artwork 
together for the official EveryBus t-shirts, and I'm also doing a new 
camper shirt, as there have been so many requests for one over the    
years. What I need is line drawings of the side views of busses with  
the pop-tops in the up (camping) position.                            
I have a few, but some of you might have some better ones. Here's what
I need:                                                               
Splitty with square top                                               
Splitty with sub hatch                                                
early (68-73) bay westy                                               
late (74-79) bay westy                                                
vanagon westy                                                         
Eurovan westy/winnie                                                  
If you have any sundial, riviera, or others, send them- the design    
isn't exactly finalized yet, and I might use one.                     
Again, what I need is SIDE view, line drawings (not pictures or       
photos)                                                               
like in the owner's manuals, or Bentley cover. Smaller, with less     
detail would be great, as these will be scanned in and shrunk down to 
about 3". Too much detail might get blurry.                           
Please e-mail them to me ASAP if you can. If you don't have access to 
a scanner, and wanted to mail copies, I could work with that also, I  
just need to have everything together by the end of next week.        
  Anyway, as soon as I get the finished artwork, I'll post it and     
start taking preorders. Look forward to seeing everyone at EveryBus   
this year!
