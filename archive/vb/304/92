Subject: RE: [VB] 6v bulb upsizing

  Are you talking about headlights, if so you can use a cheap aftermarket
hallagon headlight (7")bulb and replace the bulb with a 6 volt H4 bulb,
according to my books there is a 60/55 watt H4 bulb available. Another
interesting thing I found was different wattages of bulbs for the T/S ,
brakelights ext.

  These bulbs are sold by a company called NARVA out of Germany. I have
ordered a complete bulb sales board from them that has every bulb any bus
would ever need in 6 and 12 volt in different wattages

Hi guys,
Is there a way of upsizing from the standard 6v bulbs
to more powerful ones?
It's easy in a 12v bus or bug but I'd imagine that
that sourcing more powerful 6v bulbs is an issue.
Has anyone tried it?
Do any of the big shops sell them?
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
