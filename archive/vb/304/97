We have two kids, and indeed we didn't own just the bus.  We also had a
VW bug that was two years older.  The bus is a perfect vehicle for kids,
being roomy and having great visibility.  Ours has served in this way for
over a decade and it looks like it will continue until our children go
off to college.

No it isn't.  Having a vehicle burn isn't a common experience, but it
isn't unknown either.  You take precautions to prevent it.

No, the lady wants to drive a bus, as do most of the people on this list.
Why should we question her choice?

Nope, not at all the same thing.  Loading the family in a bus and heading
off to an event isn't irresponsible at all.  I've done it for over a
decade and don't intend to stop.  I've seen a Ford pickup, a Chrysler
minivan, and a Chevy corvette on fire in the last month, so should we
ban those vehicles?  Of course not.

Mat, you are obviously a person who views buses as anacronistic
toys, not as serious tools for living.  Many of us drive our buses every
single day without incident, a fact that you seem to have missed.

There are few other automotive events where the participants care enough
to help out someone who had misfortune along the way.  This is a trait of
the VW community that is very impressive and shouldn't be criticised.
