Except for a few pictures, I have never seen a factory 25/36 hp
thermostat bracket. Most of the motors that I got back in the early
seventies were missing all that hardware. Even most of the 40 hp were
missing their flaps and thermostats back then. It seemed to be the rage
to pull off all of your thermostat stuff and let the air blow! It's some
California thing I'm sure.

You'd think by now we'd be able to discount the 25/36 because who
besides David has a running daily 36hp? heh heh Hi Ray, Yes, but we were
thinking of the poor volks out there that might try to mount
the pre-40 HP bracket on thier post-36 HP engine and not have any
adjustment
for proper flaps opening!  Berry berry bad!
