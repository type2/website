http://www.type2.com/library/electris/bulbs.html has the 6012 listed,
and the base data on that page is made from a couple of years of dealer
accessory catalogs.  The 4458, 6014, 6015, and 6016 bulbs are all
useful upgrades to the standard 6012.  For all of these, on low, 25%
more current buys you 25% more light.  On high, 20% more current buys
you 19% more light.

The halogen types H6024 and H6026 have a slightly wider beam and better
light output in low beam; the H6024 is a particular winner on low beam
at the same current as stock with 35% more light output.  On high, 30%
more current buys you 30% more light.  Wagner also has a "long life"
version of the H6024 that is rated at 900/1500 hours.

The specs from a Wagner Lighting catalog...
