Micheal-
Yes you can put the H-4 type headlights in your bus. That is the only ones I
run in all my buses. I have tried the 15 dollar a pair ones and they are
decent. I no longer run those in favor for the hella ones. Hellas are about
80 dollars a set but are well worth the extra $$$. The pattern & intensity
of light is far superior to the cheapos. But one thing you have to do to run
them is make sure your headlight circuit connections are all clean and well
connected (especially the ground ). I have heard people talk about H-4's
burning up light switches (they do pull a couple of more amps) but I have
yet to have one fail running H-4's. If that is a concern to you then you
could wire in a couple of relays to handle the load.
