Subject: Re: [VB] Thermostats...

Hello Guys  Let me throw my 2 cents in here I have seen therostats that had 
overheated so bad that they were bellowing out of their bracket, when this 
happens the flaps will end up in the close postion and can overheat the motor 
,which was already over heated The worse case was caused by a mouse nest on top of 
the clylinders. I have also seen the bellows split around the thermo. and 
cause them not to work. But for the most part they work well and last a long 
time. I personally run them in all of my bugs and buses except my 51 standard bug 
which has the old stlye ring behind the fan. Either way it pays to an eye on 
them Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service  Salem Va     PS
