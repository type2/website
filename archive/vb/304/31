I am not a thermostat expert, but from the manuals:

The '67 Bus parts manual at the doc project lists 111 119 159 up to engine
6 120 730 (1200, about October 1961) and 111 119 159A from engine 6 120 731
onwards.  The bolt and washer are the same for both applications and are
Normteile N 11 654 2 (washer 9.5) and N 10 238 7 (hex head M8x15).  The
'54 Bus parts manual gives the 111 119 159 number, different Normteile
for the washer (N 11 517) and bolt (N 10 515), but similar descriptions
for the washer and bolt.

The '69 Without Guesswork manual says that the thermostat for the earlier
engines (6 120 730 and before for 34 DIN hp, 3 930 188 and before for 30
DIN hp) should be tested "in water" at 75-80 C, while the thermostat on
later engines should be tested at 65-70 C.  The '73 Without Guesswork
also gives the 65-70 C spec.

The reprint '50-'62 Bentley, on page M-4 5, has a note that from engine
6 120 731, chassis 834 154, the thermostat is 65-70 C and is marked with
"65" and the degree symbol.  Previously it was 75-80 C.  This corresponds
to the Without Guesswork information.
