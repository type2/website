	Actually there is another kind with the all the way around loop,
and the round hole.
	like you say, the ovalled hole is useful for adjusting the
thermostat.

	 If you have an older version with the circle hole you can oval
it out with a drill bit  (BTDT)

	Think I have the set up on my 53, think it's the original
bracket and thermstat to the bus.  Maybe I'll put a picture on
vintagebus.com
