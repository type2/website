Subject: Re: [VB] Westy cabinet installation

There is a metal U channel that attaches to the side door with 4 screws along 
the top of the door panel.   The spice rack hangs on this.  At the bottom an 
L bracket is screwed to the middle of the rack and door.  I have seen people 
use two L brackets at the top if they are missing the channel.

The table has hinges that screw to the table and the door.  The telescoping 
leg has a bracket that screws to the door.  the trick is to screw it to the 
door where there is metal under the wooden panel.  

I might be able to find pictures.   I am looking for an OEM U channel for my 
65 SO-42 westy actually, if anyone has a spare   :)  

I could make one, but it actually has a funny angle in it, and me being kind 
of a vintage pervert and all I'd like a real one.

How does the spice rack and table attach to the inside
of the cargo doors on a 67 camper??
