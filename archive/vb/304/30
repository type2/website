if 1)chris is somewhere on her way to flagstaff and we know where she is at, 
and 
2)someone can ferry her and her children up and continue to flagstaff, 

becky and i can loan her our '66 westy indefinitely until she gets her next 
bus again. the last thing i know is that she was on her way to flagstaff and 
was going to stay at my home b4 arriving at havasu. wish that would still 
happen.

jp is with us here and he mentioned a '68 or '69 dormobile shell and some 
camper interior parts that he might be able to get together. 

ricky
