If it is a bad center section, what exactly causes that symptom?
Hi Wade,
Well it is most likely a problem in the center section.  Sounds like it is 
getting into two gears at the same time, because of a detent ball and its spring 
geting weak.  This is an easy fix now, compared to when it causes damage 
sometime in the future.  Much like hearing a rod knock and getting it fixed 
quickly before all heck lets loose in an engine.
