When I did mine, the only rivets I could find at the local hardware store
were 1/4" and 1/8". The holes in the flap were somewhere in-between. I
really didn't want to drill the holes up to 1/4", in case I ever came across
the correct size (plus I would have to open up the holes in the rubber
gasket too), but next to the 1/8" rivets were packs of small washers made
for riveting a smaller rivet into an oversized hole. Worked perfect, and if
I ever came across "correct" rivets for a good deal, I can put those in with
no damage done to the flap. Super cheap  too.
