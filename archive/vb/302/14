Subject: Re: [VB] speedo removal

If you've removed the two short phillips screws, it should drop right out.
Try pushing gently on the face as you pull from the rear. It's prolly just
stuck (rust?) in there. The two brackets that the two screws
hold down have curved slots in them, and the speedo may need to be turned
slightly to remove. Can't remember which direction, it's been too long.
Get a small mirror and a flashlight back there and check it out.
