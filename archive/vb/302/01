Subject: speedo removal

hey all,
   im workin on my bus today ( as usual ) and im trying to remove the speedo so i can clean it and reset the miles on it. i removed the two screws, and all the wires are off, but when i go to pull it out, it wont come out. so my question to you all is, how can i get it out? i dont want to disturb the rubber seal. thanks in advance.
