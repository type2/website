Andy,

Lead/tin/rosin flux solder was used on all the original old tvs and radios
and they all had steel chassis. Use a 100 watt or more iron, and when you
get the area hot enough, the solder/flux will flow on. I used to use steel
chassis's when I was an experimenting kid way back when. Plus, I've done
the repair.
