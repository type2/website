Subject: Re: Battery hold down

When I got my '64, I think the battery was lashed down with a bungee
cord.  The fixed end of the strap was still secured to the outboard
part of the floor, but the strap had rusted through about 6-8" (15-20 cm)
from the floor.  The other half of the strap, with the latch, was in
the usual "random parts" box that came with the Bus.  The hook on the
inboard part of the floor was also still there.  The floor itself was
not scary, but not perfect either.

What I did: Removed the original stud for the outboard end.  I used a
piece of cardboard to make a template, and cut out a piece of 1/4" or
3/8" (6-9 mm) plywood to fit on the floor.  I drilled a hole in it where
the fixed end of the strap goes and cut a square notch around the hook.
I put a long bolt with a big fender washer up through the bottom to hold
down the fixed end of the strap - I can adjust the strap length by moving
the nut and locknut up and down on this long bolt.  I spliced the strap
itself back together with two lengths of pipe hanger strap (mild steel,
not too great, I know) and some bolts.  I made a battery cover out of
two lengths of 1x2 stood on their 1" side along the long edges of the
battery, with a piece of the same plywood over the top.  I had to
notch the 1x2s to clear the battery terminals.

The net effect is that I can put the strap over the battery+cover and
latch it down with the original latch.  After a couple of initial
adjustments, the battery has pretty well stayed put.  YMMV.
