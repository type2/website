Yes, but...

The dripping has to start sometime, and standing still is the best way to
accumulate dripping gas. Example - last summer, my engine, which usually
never drips anything ever, developed a huge gas leak within the space of
two minutes. I was fortunate to smell it as I was leaving the bus to mail
a letter. And I do regular maintenance.

I would never tempt fate by even using an incandescent bulb near the bus.
Uh Uh!  Not me. I put too many decades into maintaining this silly bus to
do something crazy like that.
