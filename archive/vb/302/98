Subject: Seeking travelers Lancaster (Rosemond) to Lake Havasu

My wife is jonesing for a smallish dog (Corgi-mix, Female) that is in Rosemond,
California. Very near Lancaster on CA State Rt. 14. Somewhat near I-40 when
using a really wide brush. I want another dog about as much as I want Michael
Jackson to babysit my kids, but hey, it's not a first marriage so...

Is there anyone who is or could come through that area on their way to Lake
Havasu? The Buses by the Bridge event will be held in Havasu next weekend
(01/16-18/2004). Your choice I could promise you either a cold beer or to leave
you alone at the event once the dog is transferred.

Please pmail ellisjames at yahoo dot com if you can assist.
Thanks,
