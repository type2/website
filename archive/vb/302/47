Subject: ADMIN: AOL Users - AOL Dropping Mail

All,

Over the past week or so the Type2 and VintageBus admins have been getting
complaints from AOL users about missing mail.  Most commonly, AOL users
cannot see the mail coming from the mailing list, but can still post to
the list.  There have been other problems, though.

The mail server logs at type2.com show that all messages are being
accepted normally by AOL's mail servers.  And the admins haven't removed
AOL addresses from the subscriber lists on purpose.

As far as we can tell, the mails are getting trapped in AOL's junk mail
filters.  Apparently AOL has made some changes lately that make it rather
easy to inadvertently add email addresses to the "blocked senders" list
for your address - you may want to check your mail filtering/sorting
rules and preferences.  This may be slightly more likely to happen with
AOL version 9.

AOL may be having other problems that can't be resolved by changing the
settings on your account.  If looking at your mail filtering options
doesn't help, you may wish to contact AOL support.

If you are having trouble, PLEASE DO NOT POST TEST MESSAGES TO THE
TYPE2 OR VINTAGEBUS LISTS.  Instead, write to vintagebus-owner(-at-)type2.com
or type2-admin(-at-)type2.com .

As a workaround, you can read the last several days worth of posts for
either list on the Web at the following links:

VintageBus  http://www.type2.com/~splittyreflect/

Type2       http://www.type2.com/~type2reflect/

Again, write to vintagebus-owner(-at-)type2.com or type2-admin(-at-)type2.com
with questions.

Thanks!
