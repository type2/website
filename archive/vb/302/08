Subject: Hey New Yorkers...

Three of us are coming to NY from the UK on the 14th for a mini 
vacation.  We're all vw owners in one way or another (57 samba, 74 
Karmann, 72 T3) and I wondered if there was any social events on between 
14th and 18th where we could swap stories of life on the wrong side ; )   ??

thanks

Lee  '57 samba
