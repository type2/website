I had to put in a new battery corner sheet metal when I restored the bus.
Used a cheap repro piece of replacement sheet metal that works but could
have done better in hindsight...... Anyway, running a 12 V battery so I
bought a universal non-metal tray with the j-bolts and battery hold-down
they bolt to. The tray is held by four bolts  with thick rubber washers
between the bottom tray and metal..... Area cleans easier with a bit of an
air space between the two, but still disassemble every spring to clean
up....

Not stock but works nicely....
