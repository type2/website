Subject: Battery hold down

Happy New Year to everyone.

After changing the Bus's oil last nite, I decided it was time to do
something about how the battery is held down in my '66.  I am fortunate that
the original hold down strap is still in place and works fine with a piece
of 2x4 on top of the battery to take up for the space lacking since the new
12V battery is much shorter than the old 6v battery. Everything is held down
tight, but I was curious as to how some of y'all may be holding down your
battery?  

Thanks
