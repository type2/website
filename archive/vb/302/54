Subject: Re: [VB] Battery hold down

I haven't gotten to it yet but I think I'm just going to have a piece of
wood under the battery in the 57. It's 6v still but it's one of the small 6v
optima batteries, looks like a 12v optima cut in half. I thought about
turning it on it's side and shorting the strap, i just hate to cut it.
