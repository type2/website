From LA, take the 14 freeway toward Palmdale, take the Pearblossom Highway
exit, go past about three traffic lights, and look for the restaurant on
the left.  If you get to Four Points, you've gone too far.

Bring your appetite, this place serves great breakfasts!

We'll probably hit the road at about 9:00.  I drive a stock 1600
so expect to cruise around 60 or so.  Bring your FRS radios (on
Ch 2, of course) so we can converse.
