Subject: Single Port Head Help!

Hey All,

	I'm refreshing an engine I got and it's turning out to be a nightmare.
	I thought I could tighten some nuts, clean a few parts and have a nice
'putt-around-town' motor.  Boy, was I wrong.
	So.  My dilemma.  I have a sngle port head that has a rocker arm stud that
stripped.
	The thing is it's a weird configuration for the stud.  looks like it was
rebuilt and 'reworked' with some special type hardware.
	Has anyone seen anything like this before.  Does any one know where I can
get a replacement.  Does anyone have a stack of junked heads that they are
willing to take a look at to see if I they happen to have one.

here are pix

as a side note, the 'stud' looks to be a single machined piece.

	Thanks in advance for all your help.
