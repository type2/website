I agree.  For quite some time on non-VW cars we had a reflector heat lamp
(like is used in bathroom ceilings) mounted on a ceramic swivel base for
the express purpose of warming the sump.  It would work even better on a
VW sump, but I've never needed to keep a VW warm to start it in my mild
climate.

If your vehicle is dripping gas, cold starting is the least of your
worries!
