Subject: Selling 65 kombi Portland, OR

Hey list,

I am getting ready to sell my 65 kombi this spring. I need to do a little
pretty-up work on it and light mechanical maintenance etc, and then get
serious about getting rid of it.

Does anyone have any advice about using Ebay?

I'm thinking I'd like to get about $5k for it...

Thoughts?
