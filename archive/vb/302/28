Subject: battery explosion cleanup

As you may remember, I posted an earlier message about
my battery exploding.  I've since replaced the
battery.  Now I am facing the problem of cleaning up
the mess.  Right after it exploded I squirted the area
with water and mild soap I use to clean the windows. 
Later when I got it home I hosed it down again with
water.  The next couple days I noticed a white and
brown corrosion building up in places.  I mixed up
baking soda and water and applied that with a squirt
bottle and then dried it off in the sun.  Then I
applied some diesel fuel and wiped it off thinking it
would leave a light film of oil.  It looked better, 
but a couple days later some places again showed
corrosion with a white powder deposit.  Does anyone
have experience with this kind of contamination?  It's
left the engine and compartment with splatter like
corrosion deposits. Thanks for the help.
