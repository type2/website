Paul,
back in my Formulae Vee days we used to do a lot of radical things to
the 1200 and even the 36hp cases. The 40 hp case has some real
challenges, the primary being the tiny oil pump and oil galleys. A lot
of people are concerned with the cam riding on case material because the
early cases had no cam bearings, but this area is rarely damaged when
the cases go into the shop. I have had several cases machined for cam
bearings but the expense is not worth the effort. The current 40 hp I
have sitting on the shelf is a factory bearingless cam case. I have used
69mm cranks, 36 hp rods, and Corvair cylinders to give me some real
CC's, but with all big bore mods on the 40 hp case something will break,
and it's usually the case. IMHO, I would track down a good used late
model case with the big oil galleys and spend your valuable shop time
putting together an engine that will haul your bus around comfortably
and last for awhile.

 looking for a rebuildable engine and he said many years ago they would
take a 1200 case, have it machined, and put in 1600 pistons and
cylinders.  What is the general feeling on this?
