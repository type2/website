Subject: 1200 40hp case to 1600

Hello friends,
A question for you.  I am acquiring a 64 or 65 bus this next weekend.  It doesn't have an engine in it, but, I have a running 1200 40hp motor from a 65 bug.  This bus will be a school project for myself for this current semester (I am training to become a shop teacher).  I have acess to a great shop with every tool I could ever need, and more.
One of my main goals is to rebuild an aircooled motor to really get my hands dirty.  I was talking to my mechanic friend today, looking for a rebuildable engine and he said many years ago they would take a 1200 case, have it machined, and put in 1600 pistons and cylinders.  What is the general feeling on this?  Am I asking for trouble with the 1200 case and internals?  Can I have it machined to accept a 1600 crankshaft?  The reason for all of this is to build a motor for as little money as possibe, using parts I already have.  I also want to keep the 6 volt electrical system.
Thanks in advance for your input,
Paul Klein
