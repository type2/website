I know nothing about this particular product, but here are some general
cautions:

In order to keep the oil warm, it has to circulate.  With a heater that
heats the oil directly, the only way to get it to circulate is to put the
heater in the bottom of the sump so the warmed oil will rise and be
replaced with cooler oil.

The dipstick heater doesn't seem to do this, so you'll end up with very
hot oil around the dipstick, but the oil in the bottom of the sump (where
it counts) will still be very close to ambient temperature.

The heat should also be applied over a large surface area, so the oil will
not be heated to too high a temperature.  Another minus for the dip stick
heater.

If I were contemplating a sump heater, the variety that replaces the sump
plate would seem to be best.

Even a radiant heater laying on its back under the sump would probably
work better than a little dipstick heater.
