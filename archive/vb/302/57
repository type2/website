Subject: RE: [VB] Battery hold down

When I got the firebus, half a log was (still is) sitting on top of the
battery and then the strap over that.  Neither the v80 or the tipper
have anything holding the battery in place :-O

The battery covers fit perfectly over the original VW issued batteries.
I have an NOS Canadian VW battery that will go in the double cab and the
original stamped metal top fits like a glove. (unfortunately the battery
is from the early 80s so let's all just keep that a secret!... then
again, I've never given it a charge so I don't even know if it is good)
NEVER throw away and original VW battery.  They CAN be rebuilt.

The hold down straps came in a multitude of lengths.

Twas writ:
After changing the Bus's oil last nite, I decided it was time to do
something about how the battery is held down in my '66.  I am fortunate
that
the original hold down strap is still in place and works fine with a
piece
of 2x4 on top of the battery to take up for the space lacking since the
new
12V battery is much shorter than the old 6v battery. Everything is held
down
tight, but I was curious as to how some of y'all may be holding down
your
battery?
