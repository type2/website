Subject: Tires + sheetmetal

preface- trying to get my more or less stock 65 standard bus back on the road after a 20 year hiatus...

1. Need tires for my 65 bus- have been recommended michelin agilis however they seem to be discontinued in canada (toronto more specifically). Can anyone make a recommendation on a comparable radial (i am not going to wade into the bias ply discussion) that would be suitable (michelin or otherwise).I had a look at type2.com but most info on tires seems pretty dated

2. also need to redo the front floors on pass and drivers side- anyone had any experience w/ Wolfsburg West sheet  metal or MetWiz's? I prefer OG metal but seems like a needle in a haystack finding front floors that are better that mine and don't require someone drilling out 50 spot welds.

I am not on list so please p-mail with any suggestions, much appreaciated..

hopefully one more bus on the road this spring!
