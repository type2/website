my dormo (even after catching the whole thing (battery) on fire has the top and the 
press board insert. i have added duct tape around the exits where they can touch the 
metal battery connectors and cause bad things to happen when off roading....... the 
top fits fine on my new 6v battery also.

see you at bbb8 i will be leaving this saturday and driving patch the 78 green riviera.
