Subject: VW Greats Magazine  Bill May.......Someone must have these!!!!

I am looking for the issues Jan/Feb 1974 and Issue July 1974 for a project I
am working on!  If any body has these issues would you please P mail me!  I
am only needing the info out of them!   Could a member of
VintagVW(-at-)listproc.sjsu.edu please forward this there as I am not a member
but might have best luck there!
