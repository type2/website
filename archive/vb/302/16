Subject: Original signwriting paint ?

I'm about to signwrite my bus with an original style design and wondered 
what was the best paint to use.

I want to use cellulose, so that it dries hard enough in a couple of 
days so that I can buff the writing  to look faded and original, but 
figured that cellulose dries to quick to brush.  Oil/house paint will 
fix this but never really hardens enough to buff out with wet-n-dry.

Any suggestions ?
