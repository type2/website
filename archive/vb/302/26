Subject: autobody class near Kansas City, Kansas

The Northeast Kansas Technical College will offer an autobody class in 
Atchison, Kansas, during the spring semester if we can get enough 
interested parties.

I know this doesn't apply to most of members of the list (sorry), but I 
know there are a few KC area VW folks who are not on the local lists.

I have been after our tech college to offer a class for the last couple 
year.  They finally agreed to offer an evening program if I can get at 
least 6 people interested and enrolled.

If you are in the area and have any interest in joining a bunch of 
other bus folks in enrolling in the class, drop me a p-mail and I will 
send details.
