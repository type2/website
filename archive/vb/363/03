Subject: Non-T2/VW help needed in Watertown, NY

Anyone close by Watertown, NY? Happen to have a pair of crutches in the
attic/garage?

My wife, Lisa, who's been at Ft. Drum since mid-May for birth of grandson
(sigh.. #11), managed to badly sprain her ankle yesterday and needs to borrow
a pair to give her a bit of mobility until we get her back here to Oregon for
the 'real' Dr. visit next Saturday.

Distance searching only finds "Help, I've fallen and can't get up." type
companies and the local sources such as Goodwill/Salvation Army don't seem to
have the two hundred pairs or so pairs that the charities here have.

If you're in the area, and if you have a pair cluttering up your
attic/garage/storage, we could sure use them.  It just seems silly to to give
a large corporation $ for something that I already own like half a dozen pairs
of.

I'll gladly send them back to you or send you a similar sized aluminum pair
now or I can pass them on to the next person in need.

She's 5'4" so a shorter pair would be needed.

Please reply p-mail if you're in that area and either can help or can point me
in a better direction.

Thanks,
