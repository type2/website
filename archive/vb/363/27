Hi Richard,
Please do edit down the past Email/s you are responding to in your Emails  to 
the list!!  See above for example of editing.  Otherwise it costs  more and 
more store multiple copies of old Emails in the archives!
  As for your question.  Go to Wolfsburg West and enter "cable  seal" in the 
search engine there.
Thanks,
Eric&Barb
