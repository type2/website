Hi John,
When Eric was sick for a while we bought a rebuilt engine.  The engine  
rebuilder was a friend of our's and had included the slip in 1641  P&Cs.  We were 
quite a bit leery of these P&Cs due to all of the  talk we have heard over the 
years of them warping.  The engine before that  we had figured on keeping our 
oil temp well below the 230 F mark and prefer  below 220 and when getting 
above 210F we start to slow down the  engine RPMs.  Doubled our engine lifespan 
from about 40,000  miles.  So now with over 60,000 on this same engine, and it 
is  still working like new.
  On the other hand we have been wondering about building an engine  with 
stock 1600 P&Cs with a 72 or 74mm CW stroker crank.  This would  deliver more 
torque which is a buses best friend and less possible cylinder  warping problems.
