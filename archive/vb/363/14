Been told that muriatic acid is basically just hydrochloric acid watered
down for pool use.

Try Kroil from Kano Labs. Go to www.kanolabs.com. You can order a can for
8.95 plus shipping. I have had a 10 oz. can for years. You only need a
little and it seems to work pretty well when ever I had a problem. Spray it
on, wait a while(10-15 minutes), spray a little more, bang on the bolt/nut,
try to tighten before loosen, it has always worked for me.

Anyone else used it?
