Subject: [VB] Porsche Pulley 

Is a Porsche pulley, 7" bottom worth it depends on where you live and how/what
you drive.  Going from a 1:1.73 to a 1:1.93 doesn't seem to be worth the
effort.  My ratio is 1:2.20 and my Westy is loaded pulling a trailer in
100-110+ temps.
The cost of the pulley(s) compared to hurting the motor is well worth it in my
book.
