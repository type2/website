The linkage needs to be modified so that the 3/4 side will clear the fan
shroud. As it comes from Scat, it doesn't clear (how they let that one go, I
don't know). The bracket does need to be attatched to the fan shroud for
stability or you will end up with linkage that keeps coming out of
adjustment. FWIW, all Scat carb kits we sell we modify the linkage so that
it will actually work as a "bolt on" so no modifications on the customers
part is needed.

You need to install a return spring in the system. If you are running an
alternator, the easiest way is to drill a small hole in the outer lip of the
alternator, and connect a pull-spring between that and the lever arm that
the throttle cable attatches to. You can put the spring anywhere you want
really, but this is the most common. The return springs on the carbs are
only for the accel. pumps to work properly, not to return the carbs to idle.

Other than these two minor details, the Scat kits are VERY nice, especially
for the price.
