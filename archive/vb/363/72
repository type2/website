George,
	Behave!  We all know that you want to burn really bad.  Last year I 
missed Jerome because of Burning Man.  This year I'm heading up the VW 
Bus Camp at Burning Man and you folks need to think about joining us.
www.vwbuscamp.com.  Join the list.  The info address is wrong.  Just 
join the list....  Gary Gibson
