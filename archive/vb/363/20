Subject: Removing Speedometer cable from left front wheel

Hey everyone

Is there anything inside the drum that holds the speedo cable in place?  There
does not seem to be a connector on the back where it enters and I've
disconnected the cotter pin but I can't seem to remove the cable from the
back.  Any ideas?

Thanks
Dave
