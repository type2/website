Subject: Re: [VB] Shift rod bushing

Hi Lindsay,
To remove the rear shift linkage you need to remove the engine and  tranny.  
Then unbolt (most likely these will shear off due to being rusted  in place) 
the front solid shift linkage, and slide out the rear shift rod.
  Once the rear shift rod is out it will be obvious how the  bushings fit on. 
 Especially when you remove them.  Kind of like sex  for the first time!  
Whoo Hoo!!  ;-)  We found our replacement  shift bushings had nasty casting flash 
on the inner lock stub.  We had to  carefully pry each shift bushing open 
with one hand and with the other  hand exacto knife the flash away.
  With new bushings the shifting was vastly tighter!!!
