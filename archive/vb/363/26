Subject: Another Bus Project

Hey Everyone

My wife and I are embarking on journey to restore a 64 Bus.  I have set up a
web site to show everyone where we are with the project and how it is
progressing.  If you have time check it out at
http://www3.telus.net/public/conmar/Dave/index.htm

I know it's a long URL but that's what free web space is like.  At least there
are no ads.

Thanks

Dave & Jenn
