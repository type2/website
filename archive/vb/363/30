My kids are gone & I am still looking for it! The 65 Deluxe Westy? is still
sitting on jacks in the Garage waiting for new brakes-for 7 months now. New
engine installed & running, but not sure if it will stop! Too many other
projects.

Tom Buese-do it while the new project excitement is still burning!
