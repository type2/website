Subject: Shift rod bushing

Afer lurking for the last seven years or so, I've got a silly question that 
I can't seem to find in the archives.

I've got a '67 Deluxe that appears to not have had bushings for the last 
seven years (oops, and there I thought shifting was supposed to be that 
sloppy), now I've got them but am unsure how they go in. I've replaced the 
shift coupler recently so I'm slightly familiar with the rod itself but want 
to make sure I've got enough information before I get under there to do the 
job.

Can anyone share a photo of what they look like when they're in? How are 
they held in the tube? Two of the bushings look like badminton birdies - I 
assume one goes in the backside of the rod tube (just infront of the 
coupler) and the other at the front of the tube? Do I grease everything?

I'm on digest so pleae email me directly if anyone can help me, I hope to 
get this done tonight!

Thanks,
Lindsay
