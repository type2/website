Subject: Re: [VB] More on 356 Porsche Pulley and ramblings

I just did the pulley swap too. All the talk on the list over the last 
few months pushed me off dead center.

The first belt I tried was a match for the Gates XL 7340. It was a 34" 
belt and was so short I couldn't get it on the pulleys. I have the late 
model D pulley, which I don't think is really any bigger than any other 
pulley. I have a bunch of old pulleys and they all look the same to me.

The next belt I tried was a Kelly Springfield 13345. Another part number 
on the belt is 10AV0875, which stands for 1 cm wide x 875 cm long. This 
worked, but the fan sounded like it was going to explode. The ratio of 
fan to crank with this belt was about 2 1/4:1. The next belt I tried was 
a KS 15350, or 11AV0890, 1.1 cm wide by 890 cm long. This resulted in a 
2:1 ratio and a much quieter fan. The stock VW pully gave me a 1.75:1 
ratio, so I'm getting a little more out of the fan without running too 
big of a risk of slinging parts through the side of my bus. I decided to 
keep the 13345 belt just in case I want to see how it works out on the road.

I have a 1600 mile road trip comming up starting on 7/18, so I should 
know if all this makes any difference by the end of the month. I only 
have an oil temp gauge, no head temp gauge, unfortunately, but I'll post 
what I see after the trip.
