Subject: Re: [VB] Another Bus Project

Tom,
  I've got a '79 bay hulking in my back driveway after sitting in other back yards and ranches since I bought it in late 2001. Tail lights came in from Brazil, tires and tent stuff from Pennsylvannia, misc. goodies from Karl a few blocks away. Oh, alloys from the Pacific NorthWest due in a few days. There's always something to do, helping a cousin with his kid's first Ghia, a buddy trying to sell a convertible, guys at work without a clue. It's all someone's project and sometimes it comes together for you. Hang in there and it'll get done. 

   -Harry

btw, bays hulk, splits wait patiently
