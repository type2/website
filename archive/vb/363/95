Hello Guys    tedebare had a report right after Naturalbus this year  he 
drove down from Ohio to my shop on a friaday and we installed a true porsche 
pulley on his bus . took about 15 mins.  he reported that the oil temps dropped 25 
degrees on his ride back home . I dont remeber if he has a head temp or not.  
hopefully he will be reading this and respond   later   mark dearing
