Hey Folks,
It's been a long time coming but it looks like my '60 DD will be on the 
road in three weeks. I decided to go all out ( as much as this poor math 
teacher can afford). It's sea blue on the bottom and pearl white up top. 
I replaced the panel doors with window doors with jalousies. This is my 
dream camper. It will makes it debut at High County Bus Festival in 
Boone, NC
