Subject: pimp my ride question

It would be nice if everyone could afford to spend thousands and thousands of 
dollars getting there buses in "perfect" shape. Unfortunatley that isn't 
always possible. As much as I would love to have you (Metwiz) or any other well 
qualified body man make my bus as nice as it can and should be that isn't going 
to happen any time soon. I will be happy with my $800 paint and bodywork. My 
bus doesn't look great but, considering no matter who does my bodywork it's 
going to have some amount of bondo in it. I have 3 kids and 1 one the way. Ask me 
how many times they have bumped and banged into it. How many bike handle bars 
have hit it. So if I have to invest $800 every 3-5 years and not have to be a 
worried about someone scratching and denting it then I'm all for it. when I 
got my bus it had been hit real hard in the front. So much that the heater tube 
going to the dash was bent. Both rockers and both rear quarter panels. The 
right rear had been replaced before. I stripped the bus down. My friend did the 
bodywork and prep inside and out for $300. He painted inside and out for $200. 
Then the materials cost about $300-$400. Ok then add in the $300-$400 for 
window and door seals poptop seal and latches ect..  $1200 and it's done. That 
would maybe get one quarter panel replaced. So is it worth it to me. Not a 
chance. 
Please don't take this the wrong way. I have seen Metwiz's work and yes it's 
wonderful. I have seen Mark at Salem Imports work, wonderful. I just choose to 
be cheap and have my bus redone every 5 or so years. I do enjoy looking at 
well done buses. So keep up the good work. Maybe one day I'll go all out and own 
a nice bus. Until then me and my friend Bondo will be rolling hand in hand.
