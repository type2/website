Do you have numbers to support the choking air supply/ pressurisation  
theory?  Looking merely at the results of a change on head temp does not  actually 
show the mechanism of the cooling.   
 
It may or may not be what's going on in there.

air flow from the heater  went down with air scoops  on the bus, and the 
engine ran cooler.

I think engine compartment temp was much more important, actually.
 
I didn't put up my pressure data.
I didn't test a Porsche pulley either.

So is  the Porsche pulley worth it? IMHO I think it is still inconclusive.  I
haven't seen anyone do a true back to back test with a stock pulley  ratio
versus an increased ratio to see what difference it actually made.  "It seems
to run cooler" doesn't jive with me. If the numbers aren't there,  then they
aren't there. I want to see head temp figures between the two  before I
decide if it does anything or not. Yes common sense says "more air  = more
cooling", but it's not that simple really.

Another  spot people overlook a lot is intake into the engine bay. At 4000
rpm the  cooling system is pulling a TON of air. But the stock louvers can
only pull  so much through them. If you only rely on the stock louvers on the
side of  the bus to provide enough intake area for the engine and fan, and
you're  running anything larger than a 1500 singleport, you're choking off
the air  supply to the motor (In my opinion even a 1500 SP is pushing it).
You can  increase the fan ratio all you want, you aren't going to pull much
more air  though those louvers. You have to provide enough opening to the
engine bay  that you will not create a vacuum which inhibits your cooling
greatly.  You've got to have that pressure build up in that shroud to take
full  advantage of the cooling you have.

But now i'm rambling so I better  stop now. :-)
