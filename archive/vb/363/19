I've removed the original rusted in hex head bolts by running a small 
sharp drill along the side of the bolt, maybe cutting into the threads a 
bit.  Rust buster can now loosen the bolt and it will unbolt.  This 
sounds kind of messy and potentially weakening the joint but it should 
not be an issue.  If you saw the joint,  getting things properly aligned 
again is important.  Make sure to safety wire in the new bolt!  Gary
