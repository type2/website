Subject: [VB] UNSUBSCRIBE

Hi,
I apologize for sending this to everyone ... this is a wonderful list. I've 
sent numerous e-mails to the unsubscribe address for the past couple of weeks 
and I'm still on the list. I'm passing this e-mail address on to someone else 
who does not want to be subscribed... 
So... can the person in charge of this list PLEASE unsubscribe this address?
Thank you and carry on, everyone! You're a great bunch.
