Hi Phil,
Used on upright type 1 & 2 engines.  Will not work on pancake type  3 & 4 
engines because they use a cooling fan that is directly  bolted to the 
crankshaft.  "Try a search in the archives with "Porsche  Pulley" for more info!  
  BTW thanks to Mark Dearing!  We went to our FLAPS and  tested out the 15345 
& 15350.  They fit the  pulleys much better widthwise than the 13XXX ones we 
were  using.  Will see about figuring out the resulting fan ratios in the  
next couple of days.
