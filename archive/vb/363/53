Subject: Re: [T2] inspecting engine -dial indicator support

For anyone using a dial indicator to check end play, timing gear
runout, flywheel runout, cam lift, or ..... I highly recommend a flexible
arm to position the indicator. Particularly good around aluminum which is
not magnetic. Every time I use this I hate myself for not buying it 50 years
ago.
