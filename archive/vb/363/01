I don't know about the cooling but one thing for sure they could have spent
the money on doing the work properly and come out a whole lot better than
paying somebody later to redo the crappy wanna be work that they did. DO it
right the first time you'll come out a lot cheaper in the long run. I know
cause I have to charge to undo the non top notch rigging all the time. It
addes up fast, plus it's a pain in the a$$. Later
