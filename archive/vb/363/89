Anything you can do to help air into the upper engine compartment should 
help get cooling air through the shroud. If you can create a positive 
pressure  it will reduce the work the fan must do to move it into the 
engine. The fan will turn at the same RPM's but will take less energy to 
do so. If you put an unplugged electric fan on the top of your bus, how 
much external energy does it take to turn it at 55 mph?
Idling to 40 mph relies on sucking power of the engine to cool itself. 
Over 40 aerodynamic forces come into play. Side scoops only work if 
there is laminar flow along the sides of the bus. The bus is a blunt 
object pushing a lot of air out of place. German engineers may have 
learned that the returning positive pressure of air hits the body right 
at the louvers. At a certain speed. Go above the engineered speed you 
might find that displaced flow of air comes back to the vehicle's width 
past the length of the bus wasted.
 If the louvers don't have positive pressure, they have negative or zero 
pressure and your engine will have to work harder to suck air in, 
loading the engine for that work.
I think Lou's scoop is a good idea. The air under a bus is either 
laminar at lower speeds or trapped at higher speeds and would pressurize 
the upper engine area to move more air through the engine.
The proof would be to use moveable scoops on hoses or something. Move 
them further out and measure the oil or head temp. Or use Lou's bus and 
some duct tape to close it for a controlled run.
Just thinking out loud in this 100+ heat.
