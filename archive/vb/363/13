Just a thought and something that should be on the last-thing-to-try 
list before breaking out the hacksaw... Muriatic acid, used by pool 
people, will attack rust and remove it pretty quickly. It's messy, toxic 
and should be well respected with the use of nitrile gloves, eye 
protection and a ready source of water to neutralize it. I've used it to 
remove rust from bumpers, so it might free up a very rusty mechanical 
connection.
Let us know if it works, I'd think a well placed brush-full on a shift 
joint would do the job.
