Hello all,

I used to be a subscriber on the list, and since I have sold my bus I
lost contact.  I have a question for you all.   I am looking for a VW
Bus RC car body.  Needs to fit 1/8th scale cars.  I would like to paint
it to match my 58 panel that I used to have.  Some of you may remember
it, it was dove blue and I converted it into a mobile espresso.  You can
do a search on the samba for groundzero espresso and see some pictures.
If anyone has any info on where I can find a VW Bus RC body, or has one
they want to sell, please let me know.
