Subject: Re: Re: [VB] Soundproofing

In my '65 panel, I used an asphalt based product that is used by the construction industry around new window installation. It has a peel off sticky back that adheres very well by itself, though when you use a heat gun, it works better. It is pliable enough to form around the metal variations. I have found it in most hardware supply/lumber yards and it comes in different widths. It is also much, much cheaper than the commercial soundproofing stuff. If anyone is interested, I can supply the product name; I don't recall it off hand. I covered almost the entire back of the bus, but haven't done the front doors yet. When you rap on the exterior of the drivers door and the on the side of the bus where the stuff is applied, the difference is amazing. My panel is much quieter and will be even more so after I panel it. Jason
