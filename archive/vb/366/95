Subject: transmission woes

i have a 1967 deluxe and my mechanic mentioned that he thinks the trans may 
need to be replaced in the next year- he made it sound like it was a BIG 
ordeal- are transmissions even around for my bus anymore? and how expensive 
are we talking here? anyone with any information?
thank you so much-
this list is my lifeline!
