I don't know... Sometimes I think it's just half-vast.

You should have three wire ends at the flasher relay - one should have
black/white/green and black/purple wires on it (hot feed from the fuse box),
one should have two black/white/green wires on it (pulses to the turn
signal switch and hazard relay), and one should have a blue wire on it
(for the indicator light in the speedometer).

My Bus has a flasher like this right now.  Whoever installed it used an
adapter with one female push-on and two male push-ons to get both wires
onto one terminal.

My '64 Standard, built in November '63, has pull door handles and a big
nut.  Big nut allegedly started for the 1500-engine Buses on 1 July 1963
at chassis 1 041 014 - technically, these were the very late 1963
production.  Big nut started for the 1200-engine Buses at chassis
1 144 303 on 5 Aug 1963 - the first 1964 production.  Push-button door
handles didn't start until chassis 1 222 026 on 18 December 1963.
Basically, if your chassis number is between 1 144 282 and 1 328 871,
you've got a '64 model year Bus.  If your chassis number starts with
2x5 (x can be several things), it's a '65, and if it's 1 144 281 or
below, it's a '63.

'63, '64, and '65 US-spec Buses all have the same wiring diagram anyway.
Some of the wires are longer or shorter in different years because a few
of the components were moved around, but the connections are the same.

The flasher you have is probably from a '71 through '78 Bus.  You can
make it work like this.  Take the two wires that are crimped together,
and plug them onto the 49a terminal.  Take the other wire and plug it
onto the 49 (or +) terminal.  Make up a ground wire, at least 16 gauge
and preferably brown.  Put a female push-on on one end, and put whatever
you need on the other end to get a good ground - a ring terminal under a
bolt or screw often works well.  Plug one end of this ground wire onto
31 and connect the other one to ground.

The same flasher is used to generate the pulses for both the turn
signals and hazard flashers, so once you get the 12 V flasher hooked up,
that part will be OK.  You might have a problem with the hazard relay,
though.  This is not a flasher, but a relay that VW used so the flasher
only has the load of two bulbs (plus the relay) on it in hazard mode,
instead of all four bulbs.  The 6 V coil of this relay may last a while,
as it only operates when the hazards are on and pulses on and off with
the lights, but it will eventually burn out.  You can either install a
resistor or some diodes in the coil wire to the relay, or replace it
with two standard 12 V relays.

The diodes are probably simplest.  They will each drop about one volt,
so six in series is about right for the relay coil.  First off, find
the hazard flasher relay, and pull off the coil wire - terminal 86,
probably a red or orange wire.  Measure the resistance between terminal
86 and the case of the relay.  If it's 6 ohms or more (the most likely
case - mine was about 11 ohms), you need 1 amp diodes, and if it's 5.9
ohms or less, you need 3 amp diodes.  Go down to Radio Shack and buy
either one package of 276-1653 (1 amp) or three packages of 276-1141
(3 amp).  If you got the 1 amp diodes, fish out six of them whose part
numbers start with "1N400".  If you got the 3 amp diodes, use all six
you have.  Notice that one end of each diode has a stripe on it.  Take
one diode and put a female push-on on the striped end.  Then solder or
crimp the 6 diodes together, end-to-end, so that the striped end is
always next to an unstriped end - in other words, all the diodes are
pointing the same way.  Put a male push-on on the unstriped end of
the last diode.  In the Bus, plug the female push-on onto terminal 86
on the relay, and the male push-on onto the wire you disconnected.
Try the hazard flashers - when you're happy, mount the string of diodes
somewhere where it won't melt anything (it will get a little warm in
operation) and where it won't short to ground.

For the resistor, you need to measure the relay coil resistance as
above, then get a resistor of that same (or close) ohm value and with
sufficient power rating.  I measured my relay and posted the values
I would use in http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/043584.html .

For the two standard 12 V relays, you can use any of the 1" cube 12 V
relays that you often find in the electrical aisle (especially near the
fog lights) at the FLAPS.  You have to use two unless you can find a
relatively rare type of relay - there's a VW part number for it in the
post above.  Wire them up as shown in
http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/059222.html .

I hope this helps!
