Thanks Eric,

I purchased some Dibiten from a local roofing supply house for about $48
with tax. It's about 1/8" thick and a square weighes in at 88 pounds. Is
that the stuff you are describing? It does not have a sticky back, but one
side has a very thin plastic film on it. It is meant to be torch welded at
seams. I am not that ambitious that I want to risk a fire inside my bus. I
do have a propane torch that might do the job however.

Did you stick the material directly onto the metal panels? Or did you put
some material in between?

BTW I did look at home depot and all they had was mineral surfaced roll
roofing similar to the unsurfaced material that I purchased.

Chris
