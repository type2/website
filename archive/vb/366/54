regrets? Iv'e had a few:)

thomas, I know you will seriously regret selling your
Bus. it's been three years since i parted with my very
cherry 60 DC.

I rationanlized it going to a caring family, who would
keep it warm in the fridgid New York winters, And they
have.....But, I often click on the photo's from the
past, & I know it was one of my more dark moments when
I saw the truck leaving to take it away. SOB!! SOB!

Put it away untill, the little ones become of age,
your wife & Your  hair is turning grey, you will "not"
live to regret, having "not" sold your bus.
