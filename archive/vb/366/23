Hi Jason,

Where are you located? The supply of reliable engines changes  
drastically with location.... In the East I'd recommend Boston Bob,  
in the South Jake Raby or if you're in the West, NW Conrod.

Start with a leak down test and find out how bad the engine is. Then  
take a look at the end-play on the crank to get an idea of the  
condition of the bottom end. You may be lucky and only need a new  
head on one side rather than a whole new engine.

Steve Dolan always suggests buying a bus with a known bad or missing  
engine; that way there's no guesswork about it. Good luck with it.


Happy trails,
