Hi Volks,
Sounds like the stuff we found in a VW recently.  Eric's Bro-In-Law  bought a 
1967 Bug from a towing yard.  Eric noticed a horizontal line of  rust bubbles 
in the passenger door.  He pulled the door panel out and there  is this dark 
grey stuff and at the top where a bit of dirt collected is  where the rust got 
its foot hold.  Now the rust has worked down under the  sound deadener.
  If we were to use this stuff, would thinly tar the area, and cut the  sound 
deadener into a diamond shape so it can shed the water/dirt easier.   Sound 
deadeners do not need to completely cover the panel, just dampen the  vibration 
traveling through it.
  Check out 1970s bug doors and the factory sound deadener glued on  with 
tar.  This area never seems to rust out here in the PNW.
