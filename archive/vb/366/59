We always agonize over the better driving and better camping of the
Vanagons, but here in Cali we have to worry about smog, and the spits
and bays are easier to work on, so we are experimenting with camping
interiors. Bought a cabinent for the 62 and will be setting up a 75
sportsmobile (or rivi?) shortly as it's interior is gone.
