Subject: Re: [VB] Cool tin?

I don't have any feelings about 'cool tin', but suggest replacing the rod  
bearings.... you can use a socket and extension to remove them without cracking  
the case... they are cheap and good insurance as long as you have the pistons 
 and cylinder off...
 
also, clean out the casting flashing on the heads.   It does help  cool the 
engine better when you do that.    so when you look down  from the top, the 
areas between the fins are nice and clear... I used a file and  a drill and a 
hacksaw.  
 
I did these things on a quickie top end rebuild on an engine about 6 years  
ago, and it still seems to push my red bus around now.
 
Best of luck with the move going smoothly!

I'm  doing a quick, partial top end rebuild on an older 1600.  Keeping  the
old heads, (they look OK after cleanup), but replacing worn pistons  and
cylinders.  I finally unpacked my set of 'cool tin', and am  putting them in
place of the under-cylinder deflectors.  Before it is  too late, does anyone
have any experience with this 'cool tin'?  The  pistons I am replacing were
dished, btw, and the new ones are flat.  I  know my CR will be higher, but
haven't really done the math.

This is  a quick semi-overhaul to get me more power than the engine currently
in my  DC, so I can take a load of stuff from my old house near the coast to
my  new house in Sierra City.  It is approximately 300 miles.  Not a  whole
lot of freeway, but some interesting hills.  I will likely be  leaving the DC
at the new place, so all I really have to do is make it  there.

I have an oil temp guage with a sump sender.  Will be doing  the dipstick
feel test and spit test also.

Thanks in advance for any  thoughts!
