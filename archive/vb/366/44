Subject: Resister?

Volk-a-maniacs,

So, I was helping out my Sister-in-law's SO this last weekend with his 66
standard and its various, yet simple (so far) electrical issues.  I figured
out by why the gas gauge and the wipers only work when he has the headlights
on ---> be sure to use the proper plug on the fuse block.  Along the way to
working all this out, I discovered this porcelain resister like thingy.  The
gas gauge and wipers were routed through it from the fuse block.

It is 2-3 inches long, has one electrical connection at either end, consists
of what appears to be white porcelain, and has a wire though it that is wound
around what appears to be another porcelain solid tube-thingy.  At first I
thought it was an old school fuse since a part of the center tube-thingy was
rotted or what appeared to be burned out.  It was located to the left-hand
side of the fuse block and bolted upward with a huge lag bolt, which seemed
much larger than necessary for its purpose.

I looked in the other two '66 buses he has that are in various stages of
restoration (meaning... very early stages of restoration) and each of them had
the flange where this 'resister' bolted in, but neither had one in place.

My questions to the crew are... is this a resister?  Should I replace it to
save the gas gauge and wiper from impending doom by over-amperage?  Where the
heck does a fella find this sort of thing to replace it?  I have looked in a
couple of the usual online spots and 'resister' does not come up as a product.
What do I call this if not a resister?

Thanks in advance for your help,
Greg
