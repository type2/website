Hi Jason,
Please do not take this badly, but you really should take questions for  
buses made after the 1971 model year to the later list.  As for engine  suppliers, 
it would depend greatly on your location.  Engine size, as  long as it gets 
up to 60 MPH easily on the flats while not over  RPMing, then in our opinion it 
is fine.  There is always going to  be those who will feel the need for more 
HP and probably a few  who will try to shove a V-16 in their bus.  The type 4 
engine is going to  cost you twice what a type 1 engine will to rebuild, but 
will last two to three  times longer with proper maintenance, and not flooring 
it and ignoring it.
