Thanks Kevin, All good advice. Noise in my bus is from damn near everywhere.
Putting the roofing sheet on the floor in back and on the hump over the
engine made a fair improvement. Next stop is wind noise through all the new
illfitting seals on my front doors. After that, what to do with the roar
coming from
the vent.

I also have a lot of exhaust noise.  Did I see a thread on Samba about a new
muffler by Ronnie? Anyone know if that will be available?
