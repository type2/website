Subject: RE: hot wire at light switch

I see one of my mistakes...I've been getting the wiring diagrams
confused...I should be looking at the one labeled bus-62-usa.jpg from Thom's
website.

I see how the resistance here could cause my lights to be dim. I'll try the
wire around (i.e. work around) to determine if I need to replace that wire.

Thanks,

-Kevin

No, it goes to item J2, the dimmer switch on the floor that you can
stomp on.  The brake light switch is J3.
