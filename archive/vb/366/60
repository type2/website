Subject: 62 Devon interior

I just got back from pulling the interior on the 62 Devon Caravette - must 
have been an amazing bus in its day.  Looks like it had stove, sink, etc.. 
Huge mother of a water tank. Must have been very nice - still tho - not a 
floor plan for me.  If it doesn't have a z-bed then it just doesn't seem to 
be an efficient use of space.  I think I will use a few of the cabinets 
though - the over the z-bed cabinet is very cool - and on either side 
attaches small cabinets.  There is a ballast that hides in there that powers 
a teeny tiny florescent bulb - sets in the same place as a westy light 
fixture - the plastic cover is perfect - I was gonna dig around for some 
clam shell lights but now I think I'll just use this.  I'm also taking all 
of the switches and lights etc.  The head light rings are very nice - as are 
all of the lenses.

Two bad this interior is so GD rough - but I think the rims and over the 
z-bed cabinet w/ light and the switches etc.. will make up for what I 
over-paid for the interior

Anyone know how do I tell a 15" beetle rim from a 15" bus rim?  I got two 
off of this bus and the guy gave me an extra two - but I'm not sure that the 
two he gave me are bus rims - although the drum I put in to check em out fit 
fine. I couldn't see any part numbers on these rims - did they have em?
