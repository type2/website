Subject: Re: Selling your bus

For me, family comes first. That's why it has been over 14 years  
since I last drove my bus on the streets. However, I have never lost  
touch of the magic that the bus brought to me and my friends  
throughout high school, and in my college days. This is the reason I  
have not sold my bus.

However, my bus has had to weather some adverse conditions as a  
result, being parked in the back yard (under a cover), or under a  
leaky carport. The bus now sits in a dry garage, and my cat enjoys  
snooping around inside, and sleeping on top of the roof. It does make  
a very good storage unit for boxes and things. I do work on it, about  
1 day in 30 - which is enough for me to talk to it and reminisce  
about old times.

This is not to say that I haven't heard 100's of times about how the  
bus would be better off with someone else.

If you have the space, I would say don't sell it. However, you will  
have to forego both time and money that you would otherwise spend on  
it. You have to be OK with this. Many people can't stand old or  
broken things. If you aren't OK with it just sitting around, then I  
would say pass it along to someone who does have the time and/or money.

If you do park your bus, please make sure it is adequately protected  
from the elements. Parked over a bed of gravel is best if you have to  
park it outdoors. Keep it under a car cover, or better a portable  
carport/garage. Buy some nice plants and landscape around it - your  
wife will never know.
