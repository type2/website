Subject: Found 66 westy for sale in WNY

Fellow busers,

I stumbled across a decent 66 westy sans engine over the weekend.  The
PO had a lot of work done at a local shop and couldn't pay the bill. 
The shop owner just wants the bill paid and will sell the bus for the
cost of the repairs.  It has no engine, but otherwise it's probably one
of the most solid buses I've ever seen.  If anyone wants pictures or
more information, e-mail me at paulcwilliamson <at> yahoo <dot> com.

Paul
