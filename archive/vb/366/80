Subject: Wanted original dog legs/sheet metal

I have a `62 westy just picked up.  She is rusty and
need some serious repairs.
Looking for original steel or someplace-someone that
may sell from clean scrap buses out west maybe?

Needed non rotted straight (surface rust ok)
-Dog Legs both sides any years I can make em work
-steel under pass and driver seat above dog leg
-Outriggers
-Rockers

I can use the repop rockers and outriggers but really
wanted to go with the original dog legs.
Thanks 
Todd
