Dielectric grease aka bulb grease is good to use at all connections to  
ensure a better connection and prevent future corrosion.  It is excellent  in the 
contacts of the dome lights as it makes the pieces move nicer as  well.  You 
may also want to remove the headlights and clean/dielectrical  grease the 
connections to the bulbs and grounds there as well.  some times  there are funky 
splices in there that cause a loss of voltage.
 
You could also have corrosion inside your light switch, which  could be 
helped by taking apart and cleaning/ soldering as per  Veewee111.  I think Jon (aka 
hazetguy) had a couple fs on thesamba that he  had done that to.

I see  one of my mistakes...I've been getting the wiring diagrams
confused...I  should be looking at the one labeled bus-62-usa.jpg from  Thom's
website.

I see how the resistance here could cause my lights  to be dim. I'll try the
wire around (i.e. work around) to determine if I  need to replace that  wire.

Thanks,
