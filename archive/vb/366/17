Let's not go down that road with this. I don't know Lee, but did pass
along a link to victors bus to him. He has been a vb member for at
least several years, while that doesn't mean he cannot be a scammer,
the chances are quite small. Couple that with the other known and
trustworthy people involved with the purchase of this bus, this deal
should be rock solid. The internet scams have made doubting thomas' of
us all. I sure am happy the bus has found a home. (even if lee has to
drive it on the wrong side of the road ;)
