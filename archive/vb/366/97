I forgot to mention that I found a similar product at Home Depot but they stock it very sporadically so it may show up at your Home Depot again. I was turned on to the Home Depot product by another member (thanks, Eric!)but could never find it, which started my search for a similar product that was more available.

I found a roll of that stuff one time at Home Depot. Turns out it was the
last roll in the store and they had discontinued it. I bet it is available
at other outlets.
