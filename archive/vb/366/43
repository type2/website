Subject: thinking of selling my bus- anyone have regrets?

dear volks folks,

i am a relatively new bus owner ('67 deluxe) of four years. my wife and i 
have had some good times with our bus- took it for a trip around the country 
and it was ouronly car for quite some time, but now we have a child with a 
second one on the way and the bus is breaking down constantly- one problem 
after another! i am frustrated and pouring money into it.

basically i am thinking about selling- is there anyone out there who has 
sold thier first vw and has seriously regretted it? should i suck it up and 
hold on to her? i am having doubts. any encouragement? any offers?
