Subject: prepping sump plates gaskets

in an effort to slow the leaks on the aluminum crapcase, i've been 
painting the oil sump plate gaskets with gasgacinch... but it usually 
makes the dang things stick to case and plate, requiring scraping 
next oil change.  what else have you folks tried?  i'm thinking maybe 
a gasket shellac?

i know the first response is gonna be 'they go on dry;' however, most 
of the ones i've been getting these past years seem to be made of 
wadded-up newsprint! these ABSORB the oil and weep it out the sides 
:P  i do remember a bob hoover post about the fact that the older 
ones were oil-resistant and the new ones weren't, and you needed to 
treat them, but i can't recall what he suggested...
