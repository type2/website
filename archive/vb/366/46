From gns.wagnon:

So, I was helping out my Sister-in-law's SO this last weekend with his 66
standard and its various, yet simple (so far) electrical issues.  I figured
out by why the gas gauge and the wipers only work when he has the headlights on ---> be sure to use the proper 
plug on the fuse block.  Along the way to working all this out, I discovered this porcelain resister like 
thingy.  The gas gauge and wipers were routed through it from the fuse block.

 It is 2-3 inches long, has one electrical connection at either end, consists
of what appears to be white porcelain, and has a wire though it that is wound around what appears to be 
another porcelain solid tube-thingy.  At first I thought it was an old school fuse since a part of the center 
tube-thingy was rotted or what appeared to be burned out.  It was located to the left-hand side of the fuse 
block and bolted upward with a huge lag bolt, which seemed much larger than necessary for its purpose.

 I looked in the other two '66 buses he has that are in various stages of
restoration (meaning... very early stages of restoration) and each of them had the flange where this 
'resister' bolted in, but neither had one in place.

 My questions to the crew are... is this a resister?  Should I replace it to
save the gas gauge and wiper from impending doom by over-amperage?  Where the heck does a fella find this sort 
of thing to replace it?  I have looked in a couple of the usual online spots and 'resister' does not come up 
as a product.

What do I call this if not a resister?

My educated guess:

Your 66 was 6v.  Some one partially converted it to 12v. All the consumers are still 6v. The 'resister' you 
have is a volt-a-drop. It reduces 12v to 6v so your consumers will run.
