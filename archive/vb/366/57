Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Selling your bus

I sold my first bus and I regretted it. I took my wife camping in it  and had 
the best of times. I sold it because I thought I could put a dollar  amount 
on fun. Well that may be true for some but, not for me. So after that I  spent 
a long time trying to replace it. I finally found one and I can say that I  
will never sell it. Well, I will not say never but, I can say I will never sell  
it without having another one ready to go. I can't say that I would have the  
fun, friends and memories that I have had without it. Talking on line is ok 
but,  driving and meeting many wonderful people is worth more than I ever 
thought. So  if you enjoy having it and plan to use it then you may regret it. If 
it's  another money pit to you then you may never think twice. I know there are 
many  people that would love to have one.
