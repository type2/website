Subject: Anyone in the 29 Palms area ?

Hello list. This is David from Gainesville Florida. I
was on the list a good while back, but got back in to
my Studebakers, although I do still have my VWs. . 
 
Im rejoining the list because I have just helped my
daughter and son-in-law, move from Beaufort SC to
Twentynine Palms California. He is a Marine and this
is where they just transfered him to. 
 
I've noticed a lot of VWs in the area, so I was
wondering if there is anyone from the list thats
around here. My son-in-law would love to find a
bug/baja or sand rail to tinker with.  

So if anyone is from this area, please drop me a note.

 
Thanks,
David
