Subject: Missing oil pressure switch

What's the engine ID number? And is it along the engine case seam,
instead of below the generator stand? It sounds like you MIGHT have a T3
case, in which the senser was on the oil cooler! AL

Does anyone have any suggestions as to why this engine would not be
drilled/tapped for the pressure switch, and what I can do for an oil
pressure warning light ? I figured this must be from a later vehicle
(type 4 ?) which had a different setup for the pressure switch.
