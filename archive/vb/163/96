Subject: RE: [VB] Lug nuts - the FINAL word




A few notes

1) NOTHING on the wedged recess surface of the rim
hole. 
  
   Make sure the bolt seats in the rim are not OVERSIZED or the lug bolt is worn,this may allow the lug to bottom on the DRUM and not the rim.On my brake test vehicles with steel wheels we sometimes replaced the rim more often than the tires because we had the wheels off and on so often. 


2) CONSISTENT or UNIFORM torque of the nuts, be it by
torque wrench, grunt, weight, whatever. All the same
torque means they are equally working to hold the rim
on, no slackers to get loosey-goosey.

   By all means torque wrench.You can change to runouts both radial and axial of drums and rotors without  the correct uniform torque.On the test cars when we needed to induce runout on the rotors we would use the air gun to install one or two lug nuts and torque the rest.
