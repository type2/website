Subject: RE: accel. cable cut tranny case

actually my metal tube through the fan shroud is fairly secure-it is locked
in with a spring on the end of the accelerator cable. i think i will try to
get some brake line shroud from a bike shop near by, then run that shroud
through an old fuel line, that way no way of jamming, or cutting.

As long as the fuel line can't slide back and forth it shouldn't jam up.
On my Bus, I didn't have the metal tube that runs through the fan housing
secured very well and my throttle would occasionally jam; I am convinced
it was because this tube was sliding around.  Once I fixed it in place
the throttle quit jamming.
