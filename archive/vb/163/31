A lot of people quote static timing... Which is not that accurate for a 009,
which has varied over the years...  Not sure if any two of the Brazilian
ones even match each other :)

Get a dynamic timing light from you parts store/Sears/Harbor Freight for
like $20 and you have a good tool for a lifetime.

Set the 009 at 30 degrees BTDC over 3500RPM (I go for 3800 just to be sure
it is "all in" - you can tell with the light anyway)...  Some people push it
to 32, but I err to the conservative side.  Some even claim that 28 is the
most to go.

Also a lot of people get screwed up when they use the stock pulley to time
with...  Hmm, lets see is this pulley set for 5, 7.5 or 10 degrees???  Just
mark/notch TDC and time it from there.  I am sure (and seen) people setting
these things statically and ending up with 30+5, or 30+7.5, or 30+10!!!
Ahhhh.

A lot of people report that the aluminum degree pulleys are not even
accurate, so check them as well.

In summary IF you have a German 009 you could time it statically if you know
your stuff, but  if you have a Brazilian one you have better odds in Vegas
than getting that thing to hit 30 degrees by static timing it at 7.5.

On a related note, has anyone yanked one spring off the 009 like Bill Fisher
explains in his book?  Apparently by yanking one spring off the 009 it will
act more like a 010 or 091(?) as used in the very early busses.  Then you
get "all in" at like 1800-2000 instead of 3500.

Just a thought.

Also even Bill Fisher likes the VW SVDA for road going with a stock center
mount carb (even the Bug Spray).  He notes that with the vacuum you can run
40 degrees when needed just as John Connelly had been saying recently.
