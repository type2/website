One reason might be that it seems almost impossible to get the
correct distributor for, say, a 1600.  You can get as many  different
answers about which one to use as people you ask.  Since the 009 is
the only distributor that's widely available, and since it's so easy
to tune up, and since it works so well on Type I, you find it
everywhere.  Sure you can get piles of distributors at swap meets, but
who really knows which one to use?
