It is one of the very last 1959 models.  Probably built around 23
September - in other words, it's 43rd birthday is right about now.
From Doliwa I have the following:

24 Sept 1959  511 907  
28 Sept 1959  514 149
30 Sept 1959  514 885  Begin 1960 model year

This is a little unusual; generally the model years started on 1
August.

This Bus would probably have orignally had the "Bastard" 40 HP engine
in it.  It falls in the right time frame, May 1959 to June 1960.  It's
pretty likely that this engine is no longer in it, as VW had a recall
campaign out on them.  If the engine number is between 3,400,000 and
3,580,000 then it's a Bastard.
