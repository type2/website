this list and was wondering if Type 2 is a registered trademark with VW.

I doubt it because there are a lot of things out there called "type 2".
Do a Google search on the string "Type 2" and you'll get over a million
hits  Even VW doesn't have enough lawyers for this fight!

VW never used the phrase "type 2" to identify its vehicles to the public,
so no confusion can result from other people using the same term.
