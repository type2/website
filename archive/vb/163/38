Subject: High Beam relay for 67'?

Split nosers,

  The days of having another car besides my Type II's are now over.  The
 Geo Metro Convertible tranny went up in smoke for the second time. Either
the Aamco work was defective or the Toyota 3 speed was just a poor design.  
66K failure, $1.7K rebuild lasted less than 25K.  The junk yard gave me
$50 for it.  Although it was a clown car, it gave me time to get my Type
II's preserved. I was looking at getting the new microbus single cab --
when it came out and wanted the Geo to last until then, but no sir!

  After thinking about it and owning 3 cars again was just too much.  I
decided to take either the 61' (perferably) or the 67' (because it has
emergency flashers and back up lights) off the historic plates and make it
Street Legal (btw good album by Bob Dylan!)  Got to get the documentation
ready for insurance now.

  Last night I was going over the 67' for dreaded NJ Parsons Inspection
and the High Beam relay was kaput!  I believe I had vw part #111 941 583
with terminals 30 and 56 jumpered.  Is this the correct replacement part
since the orignal relay is no longer available?  Any Split noser's been
through the new inspection?  Do they demand you have flashers and back-up
lights?

Best,
joe
