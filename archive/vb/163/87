My '71 uses this relay with the terminals jumpered.  Oddly enough, the
recepticle in the fuse block has the slot for the extra terminal, but it
isn't connected to anything, so the jumper is needed to provide power to
trip the relay.

The "real" applications that use this relay unjumpered are those where
power is supplied to the trip relay separately so that the relay may be
switched from high to low without the headlights being on.  Jumpering the
relay draws power from the lights for relay operation.

If you relay sits in a "pins up" position in the vehicle, it is a good
idea to drill a small (1/16) vent hole in the lowest part of the case, as
installed.  If you get a water leak, the "upside down" headlight relay and
turn signal flashers fill up with water and die.  A little hole lets the
water out so they live.
