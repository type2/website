Subject: missing oil pressure switch on engine - any suggestions ?

I have just bought a 65 Deluxe which was imported from CA last month, and flew
through its MOT (UK vehicle inspection) last week, and is being registered as I
speak.

The engine is a very clean and good running 1600, but there is no oil pressure
switch, in fact the casting has no hole for one in the usual place (left of
distributor), and I can't see one anywhere else either ??

Does anyone have any suggestions as to why this engine would not be
drilled/tapped for the pressure switch, and what I can do for an oil pressure
warning light ? I figured this must be from a later vehicle (type 4 ?) which had
a different setup for the pressure switch.

Thanks for any suggestions or advice !

James.
