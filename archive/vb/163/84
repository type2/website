On my DC this part of the heater tube is covered with the plastic sheath. Couldn't be a vent could
it?

Ok people, this little hole thing in the heater tube has been bugging me...
are we talking about the small 'C' or 'U' cut (depending on which way you
look at it) and it's near the cross member right after (or before, again
pending on which way we're going) the long straight tube???  This hole is
stock.  You can see a picture of mine on one of the last pictures of my
front beam page

And I've included a larger picture of it on my underbus page with a red
arrow pointing to it.

I think it's to allow some air flow even if all the forward vents are
shut... or maybe its to allow some of that valuable heat to escape just to
keep things on the *cool* side.
