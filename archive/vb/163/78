Subject: rear seat?

i thnk i hust foudn a bus rear seat on the side of the road. in apparently
very good condiditon. i was just driving down the road in my sqbk. and saw
the legs poking out of the trash. i pulled over and check it out...the
construction seemed very similar to the construction of my fron seats. one
section of the seat(passenger side) tilts forwards when release lever is
pulled.

the upholstery looks to be in very good condition-just dirty i think. no
tears visible at first glance. it is white with grey sides.

there are also handles/grab bars on the back of the back rests.

how would i determine the year-and also if this is even for a VW.

thanks
