Subject: S.P. Longblock source in Central TX & sighting

Howdy all,
I've got a computer-less friend who is looking for a single port longblock
for his '67 kombi. He wants to be able to pick up and is looking for one
near Dallas, Austin, San Antonio etc (he lives here in Abilene.)
Any leads would be greatly appreciated!

Oh yeah, on the way to the big bug shootout in Ennis in the Westy I spotted
a lowered dove blue '62-ish panel with 5-spoke empi's on the end of a car
hauling rig going east. Anyone here?

Thanks,
Jim
