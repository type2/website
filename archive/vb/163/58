Is anyone still running with an original bastard motor??  If you have one has 
it been rebuilt.  How about dependability??  I'm purchasing a 1960 Kombi with 
an original  bastard 40 hp motor.  I would like to use it on weekends and to 
go to shows.  Should I think on replacing the block with an updated 40 hp 
one, or should I drive it until something happens.
