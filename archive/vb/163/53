You know, I never thought of that. I had a 65 crewcab but never really
explored underneath as much as I could have. Generally, if everything is
working right, there is no reason to find out why !

I wanted everyone to make sure that when I referred to "duct tape" I meant
the metal kind, not the cloth kind. I found that the adhesive backing sticks
for extended lengths of time in varying temperatures without coming loose,
since it was intended for heating system ducts anyway.

I want to go back to Kevin's question about the heater tube for a
minute:

>the heater tube under the front floor pan, or actually right where it
>king of turns up to go into the front compartment, on one side there
> is a whole.

Ray said cover it with duct tape.  Matt Roberts said it's not stock and
agreed with Ray.

I'm not clear on where Kevin found this "hole" which he described as
half cut out like not going through with a cookie cutter.  I'm going to
throw out one more idea for good measure.  If it's on the right side,
about 6" in front of where the heater tube comes through the cross
member, it could be where a cut-out for double cab rear seat heat hose
would attach.

From the description it could have been stamped like an electrical box
"knock out" and removable if the heater tube was going into a double
cab.  There's also a strange flat spot in the "toe space" behind the
front seats in a non-walk-thru bus.  It's covered with the rubber mat,
glued vertically.  I always wondered about it--until I acquired a double
cab.  That's where the other end of the heater tube goes to distribute
heat to the rear seat.

I didn't want to remove the heater tube insulation on my other busses to
check on this, but I think it would explain what Kevin found.
