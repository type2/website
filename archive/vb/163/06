Subject: RE: [VB] engine bolts

thanks for the tip...you are correct i do have a doghouse oil cooler, my
previous engine did not-hence the different attachment method.

thanks

Since that side is threaded, I'm guessing you have a dog-house style oil
cooler on your motor.  It's threaded because you can't get to the other side
of the case with a nut to put on the bolt.  I noticed the same thing when I
helped my buddy put a 1600dp in his '66 Westy Weekender.  Good luck with the
bus.
