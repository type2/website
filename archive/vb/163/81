Subject: RE: [VB] Sheet Metal Wish List - only 50 submissions?

Hey list,
I cannot open up the page that this wish list is on.  Couldn't do it on the
original post, and can't do it on this follow-up post.

Keep getting a message that says that there has been an illegal operation
performed, and the page will be shut down.

Am I the only one getting this message?

Ed
