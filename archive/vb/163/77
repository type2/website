Subject: RE: [VB] engine bolts

A friend of mine used to take 1500 blocks and convert them to 1600 DP with
dog house oil cooler. This effectively covered the drivers side top bolt
hole and made it impossible to get a nut on. His novel idea was to peen the
area around the hole with a sharp punch and then JB Weld a 17mm nut on while
being held with a short bolt. I saw a couple of these blocks and marveled at
the simplicity of the idea. One of them had the nut broken loose, I suspect
from improperly mixed JB Weld, so I ground off the remainder and replaced
the nut which I scored with a sharp chisel to hold onto the epoxy better.
Seems to work OK and is far cheaper than getting a press in nut insert
installed. 

The other odd one I saw was where someone had welded a large lump onto that
hole and then had it drilled and tapped. Can't imagine the threads would
last very long and I bet it was hard to find someone who could safely lay a
bead down on that kind of material.

i think i will leave the drivers side as is, but try the block of wood on
the clutch pedal while inserting the bolt. as for the passenger side-i
usually do the reverse of this...i put a vise grip on the head of the bolt
above the starter-before i insert the engine. it stays relatively
secure...then when i insert the engine it is easier for me to tighten the
nut from the engien compartment. the vise grip keeps the bolt from turning.
when finished i reach up and tap the vise grips with extended fingers till
the thing pops free. i read once about welding a little bar to the end of
the bolt to keep it from turning...but i get nervous about that ever
breaking partially off and not being able to ever get a wrench on the thing.
