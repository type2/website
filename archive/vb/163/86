Hi,

My name is Joan and I'm a legal assistant at a law firm in Texas. I saw this list and was wondering if Type 2 is a registered trademark with VW.

Also, I don't know who the administrators are on this list but if Type 2 is a registered trademark, could they be held personally liable for starting and or administering the list?

My firm doesn't specialze in this area of expertise so I couln't ask anyone here. Does anyone on the list have an answer to this?

 

Joan D.
