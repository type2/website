Subject: RE: [VB] Bus is hot need help

I remember someone posting printable degree markings before.  Anyone know 
what I am talking about?  I could eyeball the mark, but I would really like 
an accurate reference before I tackle this.  I think I am gonna go home 
early and try and figure it out before our club meeting tonight.  Just so I 
got it right, pick up a timing light and set it at 7.5 BTDC (-at-) 3500 RPM

Thanks for all the help everyone.

Bart
