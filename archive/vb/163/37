If this is accurate then my '59 DC w/ vin# 514942 was actually the 57th bus of 
the '60 model year, probably completed on the first day of 1960 model year 
production!

24 Sept 1959  511 907  
28 Sept 1959  514 149
30 Sept 1959  514 885  Begin 1960 model year

This is a little unusual; generally the model years started on 1
August.

This Bus would probably have orignally had the "Bastard" 40 HP engine
in it.  It falls in the right time frame, May 1959 to June 1960.  It's
pretty likely that this engine is no longer in it, as VW had a recall
campaign out on them.  If the engine number is between 3,400,000 and
3,580,000 then it's a Bastard.
