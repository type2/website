I opened up both, must be you. You're not using Netscape with Windows 98
first edition are you? That used to happen to me all the time with that
combo. I bought a clock module and use the Win 98 first edition CD as my
clock in the garage!

Hey list,
I cannot open up the page that this wish list is on.  Couldn't do it on the
original post, and can't do it on this follow-up post.

Keep getting a message that says that there has been an illegal operation
performed, and the page will be shut down.

Am I the only one getting this message?

Ed
