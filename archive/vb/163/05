Subject: accel. cable cut tranny case

i notice when i pulled my engine that my accelerator cable is slowly slicing
through the tranny case. has anyone else ever had this happen? any
suggestions of remedies...i was thinking of sliding some fuel line over it,
but i dont know it that will jam up or maybe not last very long. the slice
in the tranny is pretty bad, at least 1/8".
