If the bars did not come with that particular door, then they may not be
the correct bars for that door. There were many different ones over the
years, and there is no way except trail and error to get them right. The
fits are subtly different. Don't ask why this is true, but I recall
reading about this or hearing it from someone knowledgeable some time ago.

If this is the case, then it's off to your local salvage yard or onto the
list for help. By all means, try and determine why it is jamming. The
mechanism is simple, there is no trick involved. Observation should be
enough.
