Subject: RE: [VB] Bus is hot need help


What main/idle jet? I'd imagine you want at least a 120main/55pilot with
a stock splitty aircleaner, but it depends.
I set my 009 dynamically to no more than 32 total advance at 2800-300
rpm, and let static lay where it may, usally around the magic 7.5.
I would check jetting, might be too lean.

Well after a few months of trying to get a progressive carb working in
my
bus.  I tore it out Friday night and couldn't get the stock one in till
today, causing me to miss busengruvin.  Traded my vacuum dizzy to
Richard
Barker for a 009 and now I am unsure of what the timing should be.  Muir

says for and AE case it should be at 5deg ATDC, but that's with a vacuum

dizzy.  I have it at about 11 degrees ATDC, it's running well and idles
fine
around 900 bud it is damn hot.  All my tin is in place and the
progressive
ran pretty cool, but too rich no matter what.   So what gives? 34 pict 3
on
an AE case w/ 009.
