Hi all,

There was a recent post referring to the "Bastard" 1200cc 40hp motors ins=
talled in Busses from around May of 1959 for about a year or so.  They we=
re supposedly recalled and replaced by your local dealership with the new=
er version of the 1200cc engine.  My question is, does anyone out there h=
ave in their literature collections any original VW literature, VW techni=
cal bulletins, or workshop manual references about the "recall" program a=
nd the procedures a dealership would follow when a customer came in with =
a "Bastard" motor for replacement.  I have a June 1959 Double Door Panel =
that originally came with a Bastard" motor that was long ago removed.  It=
 now has a mid-July production Factory rebuilt replacement motor in it (a=
nd it's doing just fine, thank you!).  I, as well as several other late 1=
959/early 1960 Bus owners out there, would really enjoy the chance to hav=
e a photocopy of any VW paperwork about the "Bastard" engine recall progr=
am for our information and our files.  Can anyone out there help me (and =
others) out with the info?  I'm not having any luck finding any of this i=
nfo in my own literature collection.  Thanks in advance for any assistanc=
e!
