Subject: restoration.

Howdy,

Long time off the list. Finally decided to send my bus off for restoration
and repairs. Any thoughts or feedback on the work by ISP West?
I toured the shop over the weekend and the buses and bugs I saw looked quite
nice.

PS, I have one more pearl white wheel. First $195 takes it.
