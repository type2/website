Hello All,

I have my 1973 VW Transporter (Automatic) (Camper) finally up and running after a very very lengthy time sitting. 

I am in need of a Front Transmission Mount, the complete mount including the transmission mount that attaches to the transmission hydraulic section and the attaching bracket that attaches to the car. 

So if anyone is parting out a Automatic bus, knows of one in a yard, or has one in a pile in their garage. Please Let Me know.

Thanks in advance,

Chris
