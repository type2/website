Subject: In search of bus owner

Hey all, most specifically in the Washington Puget Sound area. I spotted a
white over green bus this last weekend in the Renton/Kent area and was
wondering if he/she is on the list. There is a all beige bus that runs
around on the east hill also that I see often, is he on the list too?

Just trying to find people in my neighborhood.
