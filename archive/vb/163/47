As long as the fuel line can't slide back and forth it shouldn't jam up.
On my Bus, I didn't have the metal tube that runs through the fan housing
secured very well and my throttle would occasionally jam; I am convinced
it was because this tube was sliding around.  Once I fixed it in place
the throttle quit jamming.

The simplest way to do this is probably to use a long enough fuel line
that you can fit it over the body tube at the front and the through-the-
shroud tube at the rear.  Put a little grease on the cable as you put
it in the fuel line.
