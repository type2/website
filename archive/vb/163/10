Regarding reinstalling the coupler, smear a liberal amount of anti-sieze
on all internal and mating surfaces, as well as screw threads, then
assemble and tighten well, but don't overtighten. Use a stainless steel
safety wire thru the holes in the coupler screws to secure the whole
assembly. If there are no holes thru the  screw heads going side to side
thru the  head, then clamp them into your bench vise, or hold them with
your vise-grip, and drill a 1/16" hole thru yourself. Use some oil on the
hole as you drill it, to save the drill bit, and speed up the drilling.

The next time you have to disassemble the coupler, it'll come right apart.
