Hello,

I just bought my second split window. I used to own a 1965 21-window when I
lived in Virginia Beach many moons ago. It was a great vehicle, but I always
reverted back to Bays. But, I never lost the love I had for driving a split.

So, I bought another one.

I currently live in Canada, thus finding a bus is rare. Finding a restorable bus
is a godsend. Finding a '60 30 minutes from my house is downright incredible.

After searching the type2.com library, I found conflicting information on VIN
decoding. I thought I bought a '60, but the following three links lead me to
believe my new bus could be a '59.

My VIN is 511518

Can somebody tell me what year this bus is?

Collie

'60 Kombi, '77 Sunroof Bus, '78 Champagne, '79 Auto Westy, '00 NB
