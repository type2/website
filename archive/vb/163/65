 Is anyone still running with an original bastard motor??  If you have one 
has 
 it been rebuilt.  How about dependability??  I'm purchasing a 1960 Kombi 
with 
 an original  bastard 40 hp motor.  I would like to use it on weekends and to 
 go to shows.  Should I think on replacing the block with an updated 40 hp 
 one, or should I drive it until something happens.
 
I have two 40 Hp motors, one in a 1964 beetle (which runs fine, i might say) 
and one
built for but not yet installed in a 23-window bus. Neither is a ball of 
fire, but both are dependable. I don't know whether either is an original 40 
Hp. It was a chore finding 
crankshaft shims for the 40 Hp. They are not the same as 1500 and 1600 engine 
shims. If 40 Hp shims are used on 1500 and 1600 engines, they can cause a bad
groove to be worn into the 40 Hp crankshaft in short order.
