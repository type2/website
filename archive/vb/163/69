Some headlight relays need this jumper and some don't.  The ones that don't
only have 4 terminals - power in, high beam, low beam, and wire to switch.

Around the first of this year I talked to a guy in Delaware who was fixing
up a Checker cab (!) that someone had put a VW headlight relay in.  He had
a broken 111 941 583 A, and the VW dealer (!!) sold him a 411 941 583 L
which worked in his application.  The 411 part had 5 terminals so he had to
jumper it, like yours is now.  I don't know about the mechanical fit of that
relay; you may have to make up a small bracket or something to mount it in
the stock location but electrically it should work fine.

I don't know what that guy paid for the relay from VW.  Bus Depot, Wolfsburg 
West, and Rocky Mountain have the headlight relay in their catalogs from
$19 to $25.  You can't use a plain relay from the FLAPS; this is a latching
relay and the FLAPS ones aren't.
