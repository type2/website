That's two for the rear, one for the front. Use the wire....

Al



was writ:
"Use a stainless steel safety wire thru the holes in the coupler screws
to secure the whole assembly."

are there supposed to be two screws? I only saw one, and only needed to
remove one to take the front linkae out. should i be looking for another
screw hole...missing screw?
