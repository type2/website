When I had this problem, I ran a ground out of the license light over to
the grounding wiring that I ran for the tail lights. Solves the problem
fast.  If I recall (I'm 3000 miles from the bus right now), I took a wire
into the license light assembly, and either soldered or clinched a ground
lug onto the bared end, and slipped it under one of the mounting screws,
then out a hole in the bottom following the other wire.

Get creative, and you can have it fixed in a half hour, for good.
