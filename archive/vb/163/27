30 sept at vin 514 885 was the start of the 1960 model year, so your bus with 
vin 511 518 was one of the last 59s.

elsewhere in the book I got the above number from, it says vin 511 713 was 
made oct 7th.  however that was an ambulance and special models took longer 
to complete.  
then 511 907 was 24th sept.  go figure

Info does sometimes conflict.  Sometimes people make mistakes deciphering it, 
or typeing into the websites.    but there isn't much differene betwen an 
late 59 and an early 60.  :)  enjoy yuour new bus.

 After searching the type2.com library, I found conflicting information on VIN
 decoding. I thought I bought a '60, but the following three links lead me to
 believe my new bus could be a '59.
