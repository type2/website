not sure if houston is too far, but there is a place called JBS (used to be
Jeff's bug shop). This guy is quite an expert on VW's, he used to race them
a long time ago-i think he was one of the best at oen time.

i cant find his number but if you call ASK auto parts in houston (-at-) 713
780-1331, i am sure they will give you his number gladly.
