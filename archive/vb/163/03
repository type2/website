Subject: Re: [VB] walter vw wrenches?

Never heard of Walter but sounds like you have an old Gedore wrench. DIN895
is basically a German Regulating Body (Deutsche Induatrial Norm if memory
serves) for Double Open End wrenches. I am not sure what the American
Equivalent but here in Canada the equivalent orginization would be the CSA -
Canadian Standards Assoc. They basically set the technical standards for a
given product (electrical products etc.)
