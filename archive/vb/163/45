Subject: Fw: failure notice/ was bus is hot need help


009? you can do it 7.5 at idle, but not at 3500rpms. I set mine at 30degrees
at full advance(give it gas untill it stops advancing). for some reason
almost every bus I ever buy has a 009 and thats the method I have the best
luck with


Just so I got it right, pick up a timing light and set it at 7.5 BTDC (-at-) 3500
RPM
