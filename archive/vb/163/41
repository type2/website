Subject: Re: [VB] New BUS!, True story

Although I don't have dreams like this my Bus is not here also. It's still in Arizona five weeks
after I placed order for transport.... I don't think I'll recommend this company to others...

hope I don't have dreams like this and that in reality it's gonna be a beautiful, rust free 15
Window DeLuxe with cut-up wheel wells and fat tires in the back...

;-)

peace,

| Hi All,
|
| I got a new bus!  I was so excited when it arrived, I had been waiting for
| some time to receive it.  The previous owner told me that it was capable of
| running and driving so I hopped in and started to check it out.  But
| something was wrong.  I remembered it to be more of an orangey/red color but
| it was yellow so I looked closer.  More rust than I remembered started
| appearing in front of my eyes everywhere I looked.  I looked under the
| rockers and to my astonishment there was NO metal under the one side and the
| skin was just some cheap patch job simply hanging there with no
| reinforcement behind it.  I frantically looked inside and to my bewilderment
| half the floor in the cargo area was gone.  I was standing on the ground
| inside the bus!  What went wrong.  How could I have made such a bad decision
| and why did I not remember all these problems when I looked at it last
| several months ago.  I exited the bus very upset.  Then to make matters
| worse, the bus started rolling forward.  I had started the motor and left it
| running before I noticed the problems and went frantically checking out all
| the rust that I had somehow forgotten about.  I ran after the bus as it
| veered across the street.  I had to catch it and pull the e-brake before it
| hit something.  Barely missing a street sign and a telephone pole, I opened
| the driver side door and pulled the brake handle.  The bus came to a sudden
| stop and the lower hinge of the door broke and it hung on the top hinge
| swaying.  I was confused, upset, and feeling very tired.  I realized that I
| had better get the bus off the easement of the neighbors house before the
| police showed up and started asking questions.  I stood there staring at the
| bus, the hole in the rear cargo floor area with the ground staring back up
| at me and the front door hanging on a single hinge.  Then I remembered that
| the bus I was supposed to be getting was another single cab and this was
| some sort of kombi, or a standard, or something else but it wasn't a truck.
| My mind raced and my wife nudged me and told me that I really should get up
| and out of bed lest we all be late for work this morning.  I let out a sigh
| of relief, got up, took a shower and met the morning feeling better knowing
| my new bus still hasn't arrived and it IS a truck with hardly any rust or
| other bad problems.  whew.
