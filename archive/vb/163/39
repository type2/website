Hi all,

There was a recent post referring to the "Bastard" 1200cc 40hp motors =
installed in Busses from around May of 1959 for about a year or so.  They =
were supposedly recalled and replaced by your local dealership with the =
newer version of the 1200cc engine.  My question is, does anyone out there =
have in their literature collections any original VW literature, VW =
technical bulletins, or workshop manual references about the "recall" =
program and the procedures a dealership would follow when a customer came =
in with a "Bastard" motor for replacement.  I have a June 1959 Double Door =
Panel that originally came with a Bastard" motor that was long ago =
removed.  It now has a mid-July production Factory rebuilt replacement =
motor in it (and it's doing just fine, thank you!).  I, as well as several =
other late 1959/early 1960 Bus owners out there, would really enjoy the =
chance to have a photocopy of any VW paperwork about the "Bastard" engine =
recall program for our information and our files.  Can anyone out there =
help me (and others) out with the info?  I'm not having any luck finding =
any of this info in my own literature collection.  Thanks in advance for =
any assistance!
