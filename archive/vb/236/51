Yeah, I still tool down the road in Uncle John's Van listening to Uncle
John's Band, and I feel a strange sense of remorse for those who never
tasted or even dreamed of such times .... Peace, John

I've been sitting here thinking about this, and descriptions are
deceiving. 
To describe a hippie would take a hundred avenues because every hippie
was his motivation of own self.
I see it mostly as a great American Adventure that the whole world
embraced.
Some good things grew from it and some bad things remain.
