Adam Smith is unhappy with you; you don't appear to have a well-developed
sense of "enlightened self-interest".  I know you've seen the crazy prices
for mis-represented VW stuff that some people ask for and apparently get.
Apply the same concept to the above situation - you won't believe the
mark-up and net profit you can get out of an economy-sized can of paisley
and a package of sandwich bags from the grocery store.
