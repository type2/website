Subject: [VB] I need to idle

Help, its been 10 years since my last vw experience, and last fall I
bought a 64 standard, which now is not idling properly.

1) It will run fine when started up cold,
	So i thought the choke might be sticky, disabled it
	no - choke seems ok

2) I checked the timing for the first time since I got  it
	( yes I know, I'm bad but it was -30 degrees with constant snow
and rain for the last six months so I haven't driven it but 200 miles. )
	the timing seems a bit advanced when it will idle ~15 degrees

3) The points seem ok - I probably should check them again

4) I would love to do a full tune up but I am afraid, the PO didn't know
what kind of motor it was -> the case says AS002..etc & made in brasil
which from what I can tell is a 74 bug motor, so I don't know what to set
the valves & timing to, oh and its a single port..

5) it has a 30/31 solex carb, bosch 009 ( centrifugal advance ? )

6) sigh... one more thing... I replaced the clea fuel filter byt the
carb today and it collected alot of rust colored material fast

7) sigh.. sigh..sigh.. after a trip to the store it stalled out on me
and wouldn't start again.  Eventually, it started, and I don't really know
why.

Maybe I just have a dirty tank

I haven't tested the compression yet but the motor seems to run pretty
good


I just want to pull up to a stop sign without straining my neck to try and
hear if the motor is cutting out while reving up the motor and stepping on
the brake at the same time.  Most of us have been there on some vehicle or
another..

thanks
