 Any ideas as to what they Wanna Be?.

 

 Different from the rest of "society", brother. Look at your nearest "non-corporate" mall for the latest in drop-out fashion garb. I think there is a "kit" being offered for just a few hundred dollars. Comes with a tye-dye by Diesel, birks, Hillfiger cargo shorts, hemp bracelets via Abercrombie, Amazon discount card for the latest GD "Dick's Pick's" or Dave Matthews cd's, and a pot leaf hat by Calvin Kline. Oh, you can get pretty well done up in the latest Punk Rock fashions too only a few racks over! :)
