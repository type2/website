Don't use it unless you plan to keep your bus out of the elements. PPG gives
OMNI a 5 year life span. The OMNI on my 60 DD started to powder out and go
flat after 3 years, been 5 now and it looks like a 40 year old paint job,
really makes my bus look vintage though.

does anybody here have experience with omni single stage paint by ppg.  im
considering shooting my 61 panel with it and would like to hear some
opinions
about it.  is it urethane?  also does anybody know about using a flattening
agent with single stage.  thanks!
