Subject: Finally, I bought my FIRST bus

Hi All, 

 

Sorry about my post a few hours ago. I couldn't help myself with the
threads of recent and adding some complete gibberish to the mix.

 

Anyway, a few of you know that I purchased yet another type 2. but this
time, I bought a bus. not another commercial pickup of sorts, but
something that I can actually haul people around in.
