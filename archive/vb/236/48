I had a 65 Dodge flower van, 3 on the tree 170 CID, that reeked of the burnt
bud. Had to get rid of it, no amount of mirror hanging green trees would cover
it up. Quite frankly, I think that's what they used for insulation in the
walls, shades of Cheech & Chong. Funny, didn't see any VW emblems on it
anywhere. Must have missed it.

I'm calling it quits on this thread. Chiming back in when real dub talk
occurs.

What is a "VW" Hippy? I admitedly wasn't there, it was before my time, but
weren't VW's new cars then? When did the VW "tye" start? From the pics I have
seen and other various media most "hippies" had other cars, like old amercian
cars and school buses. I'm not saying that they weren't around but why don't
Ford Econoline vans have the same rep?
