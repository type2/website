Subject: RE: [VB] Re: Finally, I bought my FIRST bus

Yes, fried eggs on the front and big lights on the back... all for
German TUV compliance.   I'm looking for one nice og hella round tail
light glass (I have the correct buckets, rings, etc to replace, just
need one more piece of glass).  The front has been resprayed once so it
won't really matter if I remove the front turn signals and patch a few
holes up front and respray og red.  But this isn't really a priority.
There shouldn't be any front turn signals as the semaphores should act
to warn other motorists of my intentions.  (the semaphores were one of
the reasons for getting this bus in the first place...)

No, this bus won't get the chrome treatment either... along with the
tipper and v80.... chrome is strictly reserved for the DC.


I have yet to even look at the M-code plate!!!  All in good time.

Matt inquired:

Questions: Are those late-model fried egg/fisheye/frogeye turn signals
mounted under the headlights?  There appears to be a bump above the
right headlight - a vestigial bullet/nipple turn signal or something
else?  The '66 wiring diagram shows a relay for Austrian vehicles that
made the license plate light come on with the flash-to-pass headlights;
was that retrofitted to your Bus?  M codes?  Are you going to chrome
every bolt or leave it stock?
