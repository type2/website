Shiny!

Questions: Are those late-model fried egg/fisheye/frogeye turn signals
mounted under the headlights?  There appears to be a bump above the
right headlight - a vestigial bullet/nipple turn signal or something
else?  The '66 wiring diagram shows a relay for Austrian vehicles that
made the license plate light come on with the flash-to-pass headlights;
was that retrofitted to your Bus?  M codes?  Are you going to chrome
every bolt or leave it stock?
