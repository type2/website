It was tough breaking it to her because we were due to have our first
child a month later. 
--------------------- Clip ---------------------
With a new 64 Pontiac that had dealer plates still on it, I took my wife
to the hospital for the birth of our first child in a T bucket roadster
that she hated with a passion. The new Pontiac just wouldn't start and we
pushed it back far enough to get the roadster past and drove across our
lawn to get out.
Turns out she spent 14 hours in labor, we could have taken the Schwinn.
