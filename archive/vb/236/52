In 1992 when I asked my wife to go with me to look at a 1963 double cab I
had found she went, but when we got there I pulled up and shined the lights
on it ( it was in a barn lot ) She said, " You want to buy THAT? That is the
ugliest damn thing I have ever seen." I bought it any way and drove it home.
We later took 2 different trips to Calif. ( We live in Arkansas ) One of
those trips we went to Baja Ca. and spent 10 days on the beach. Ol' Ugly has
become a member of this family.
