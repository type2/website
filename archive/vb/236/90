Definately give it a tune up.   Timing goes by the distributor, not the 
engine #.  Look in the archives for the lists of what to do when you bus has 
sat for ages and you need the 60,000 miles service.  set valves to 0.006

Yes, you have rust in the tank.  Get a magnet, sew it an a bag like a T shirt 
sleeve, and attach a stretched out wire coat hanger.   Stick it down the gas 
filler pipe, and hook the out end over the filler neck.  Your cap won't fit 
right (only with one ear), but don't worry.  Drive around.  pull the magnet 
out every so often, and knock the rust particles off.  If you have a roof 
rack, you can hang it on the roof rack while you pump yr gas, and it'll be 
dry when the gas is pumped, and it's easy to brush the rust off th bag. When 
you stop picking up rust with it, you can remove it and leave it in the 
garage.  Or give it to a buddy when just got an old bus.

    You might need to remove your carb and clean it out.  You probably have 
rust in it from the gas.  or goo from old gas sitting.

I had this problem when I got my 65, and the magnet worked a treat.  much 
better than going through a filter every couple days and repeatedly cleaning 
the carb and fuel pump.
