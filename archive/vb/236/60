Subject: wives - don't tell 'em til it's too late (risky)

I bought DARTHVW on thesamba (thanks Everett) and had
it trucked to SoCal from Wyoming. I didn't "ask" my
wife until a couple of days before it arrived. 

That's a stunt that even Evel Knievel would think
twice about trying. 

We're still married.

It was tough breaking it to her because we were due to
have our first child a month later. But I figured, I
had always, ALWAYS wanted a 21 window bus, and it was
now or never. And it arrived on my Brithday.

I even told her what I really paid for it.

Jason
