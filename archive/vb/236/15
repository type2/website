Me too - maybe  we can set up some sort of suicide pact...

I wouldn't go in for the hippy thing any more that I would getting
a pink leisure suit and driving around in a white Testarossa, or
an Izod shirt and a red BMW.  

Some things are best left in the past.  Yes, I was a child of the 80's, but
I was able to let it go.

The original hippies were an interesting bunch and all, and were part of
a larger legitimate social movement; but the latter-day, affectacious, 
products-of-marketing droids are a bit of a strain on the nerves.  My back 
yard isn't big enough to bury all of the dreadlocked wanna-bees who've come 
up to me and said "nice bus dude, got any weed?" - I may have to buy a 
chipper like the guy in "Fargo"
