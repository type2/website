Subject: VW  Hippie Bashing

Strange how" VW Hippie Bashing" is such a "sport" to some people--I even
wonder IF these "Bashers" would know a real VW Hippy if they saw one?--I can
partially put myself into the VW Hippy Class, as my age is 67, and I am
proud of what I stood for many years ago, And would do it again, and Still
do--

Even though I have been "Bashed" on this list numerous times because of
Bessie, my Grateful Dead Bus and my Tye-Dyed cloths, and pony tail--I have
yet to criticize any ones taste in THEIR VW--If that makes me some sort of
"VW Hippy"? I love it !!
Peace to all--whether you want it or not--Drive it and enjoy it--and just
let those "Other" people who do not fit into Your mold, do their thing, just
like you are doing yours-- PEACE Now and Forever, uj

PS:  Smoking "The Devil Weed" has Zip to do with any life style--Back in my
days on the Lake Shore of Chicago, and Lincoln Park,in the 60's, I knew of
at least 4 millionaires who had to "Just one Toke over the Line" before they
went to their Downtown Chicago office, to command Their Company--They ain't,
and never were, and never will be, a "Hippy".
