hmmm...
i have to say the same about my wife, 3 years ago when i told her i was 
thinking about buying a vw bus, she laughed at me. i quickly countered 
with the fact that i knew all the cliche "warnings" and i was currently 
doing my research on them beforehand. she approved of my "looking into it" 

so i continued to study, then the day came soon after when we went as a 
family to look at what would become our first vw family daily driver, and 
it still is.
now she has her own, a 67 fastback, she loves it! i'm still her mechanic, 
for now...but if this idiot can lern so can she, if she wants to.
she has encouraged me whenever i've found a new "deal" and couldn't live 
without it, as long as we could afford it. a couple times we couldn't but 
she was there too....

we have five of them now, 3 drivers, 1 restoration bound, 1 getting it's 
legs back.
i guess i'm lucky too, my wife is happy to ride along with me and she 
loves it too, sometimes more than i do. sometimes.
