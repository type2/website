I set my fuel pressure to 3-5 lbs for my T-4 34 PDSIT-3 carbs with their
bigger float bowl, and it is the same with the Center mount progressive and
the dual 34 PICT. Anymore and you flood the bowls eventually. It will work
without a pressure regulator for a while, but eventually the float bowels
level control valve/float can't compete with the pressure raw from the pump. I
have set it as high as 7 on the dial for full out highway, but around town
stop and go won't take it for long. Just my experience with the three set ups.
I pulled the Progressive on the trike when I went to the dual carbs. PITA to
balance and keep balanced, but lots of go juice off the line! I had the best
fuel mileage with the dual 34 Baby Dells, not too much different in feel from
dual PICT 34's.

Been there, done that. It's a vacuum problem with one or both 34 PICT-3
carbs.
Oh, and if you are running an electric fuel pump, check to see if the
pressure regulator is set right. Those cheapy regulators can go out of
adjustment and flood the carbs.

There is no balance tube between my Carbs, they just got short manifolds
that bolt right to the heads.
Second .............. it has an electric fuel pump but I haven't found a
regulator. If I find one what is the PSI that I should set it at?
