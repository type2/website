Subject: Hippie Bus Backfires

My 66 Hippie bus with a 1600 Dp, Dual PICT34 Carbs, Bug Pack Extractor,
hot cam, 009 distributor backfires when I let off the accelerator pedal.
I'm going to first adjust the valves, then double check timing, points,
dwell, then sink the carbs.
Would this be the best sequence to address this problem?
Or is there a simpler solution.
