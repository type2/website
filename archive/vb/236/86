Subject: Gauge locations

OK, where do y'all put your accessory VDOs in splits?  I had a nice 
3-gauge pod on top of the dash in my 71, but that won't work in my 65.  
Right now I have oil pressure & temp in an old chrome panel hanging 
under the parcel tray to the right of the steering wheel, but one of 
the gauges is not that easy to see.

Just looking for ideas.  I'd like to mount my CHT gauge as well, since 
I have it anyway.  Those of you with gauges, where do you like 'em?
