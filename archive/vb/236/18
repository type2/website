What, more hippie bashing?! Haven't we covered this
already? Perhaps we should talk about what tires to
use on our bus, or whether synthetic or natural oil is
better in an aircooled engine. How about the pros and
cons of lowering your bus?....

Peace, John "tongue planted firmly in cheek" Baker
(and I really mean that to say "peace", like REAL
peace, not department store advertised, trendy every
kids wearing a sign tshirt kinda peace. ;^)
