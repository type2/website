Why would we all want to look the same ? That's Boring !! 

 

 Wearing tye-dye in a bus, i would agrue, lends you to "look(ing) the same" it's 
like going to a Lead Sled show with a white t-shirt and pomade in your 
hair thinking you're an individual that stands out! Both are the expected 
"uniforms" for those scenes. I find it refereshing to see a nice bus 
without any reference to the dead plastered all over it, how played out 
is that?

 

  --But LOTS of other people as we cruise on down The
Golden Road--

 

 Me too and all I have are travel decals and asolid stock 
paint job on mine. I guess that's not too boring if people are waving 
to me as well.
