Subject: Re: [VB] SOs, Buses, Stuff Like That

I have to throw in my two cents regarding the SO topic. After 12 years of marriage,  a couple
kids and owning an assortment of  "unnecessary" vehicles, my wife has not been into any of
them. She could care less. The vehicles ranged from Mustangs, old Pontiacs even a close
brethren to air cooled VW's a Corvair. We even had a '66 Beetle that she really didn't care
much about. All were nice cars to be proud of. But our '66 bus is a whole different story. She
absolutely loves it! She is actually buying things for it, it's shocking. Some things I don't
agree with but I don't say anything, I'm just glad she is into it. A very good example of this
is, I came back from lunch today to find in my office a surfboard. I'm in Indiana so of course
you see Hoosiers surf about as often as you see SoCal's shovel snow or picking corn.  My wife
had purchased it used over the internet to put on the roof rack of the bus. Can't say I
totally like the idea, but it doesn't disgust me either. Same thing with a bobbly hula
figurine. She wants to put it on the dash that was freshly painted over the winter. This one
is actually growing on me a little bit. Anyway, I guess my point would be that since we are
both into Splities they will be in our family quite some time.
