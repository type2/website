Been there, done that. It's a vacuum problem with one or both 34 PICT-3 carbs.
There are several areas I would look at from experience. If this is the CB
Performance dual 34 carb set up, look for a bad vacuum balance line between
the two carbs. Other things to look at are worn throttle plate shaft holes
because of the pressure exerted from the overhead linkage. Had to rebush a
couple of carbs because of that. Check manifold gasket. Worst case, check
float bowl for leaks. The dual PICTs work good, but have these things to look
out for. Oh, and if you are running an electric fuel pump, check to see if the
pressure regulator is set right. Those cheapy regulators can go out of
adjustment and flood the carbs.

My 66 Hippie bus with a 1600 Dp, Dual PICT34 Carbs, Bug Pack Extractor,
hot cam, 009 distributor backfires when I let off the accelerator pedal.
I'm going to first adjust the valves, then double check timing, points,
dwell, then sink the carbs.
Would this be the best sequence to address this problem?
Or is there a simpler solution.
