 Hi all,
I have bought Porsche pulleys from Bernie Bergmann, he machines 
the center piece down to T-1 size and this eliminates the alignment 
issues.  This set-up plus the T-4 cooler works very well for me. I live
in Lake Havasu, Az. and even with my 1904 motor being brand new,
on the trip to OCTO/Classic weekend, the motor past the "spit" test
easily where a new Mexican 1600 sizzled badly.  Both buses with
3:88 freeway flyers, 100 plus degree temps.
 Just my thoughts and findings,
   Lou & Liz 
PS. We'll see everyone at Jerome in Sept., hopefully I'll have my
interior cabinets all in place on my '61 Hatchtop by then.
