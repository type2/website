Clara,

Ronnie gave me this lecture over a year ago about oil weight.

History: I have a 55' standard 1600cc and was running 10-30 oil, with a dip
stick tempeture shorter to the Battery light to indicate oil over heat.  On
I-5 from Seattle to Bellingham, I couldn't do 60 mph without the battery
light coming on becuase of the dip stick sensor.

Ronnie said (If I miss quote you let me know)

1) Get rid of the dip stick sensor. They are not accurate.
2) Run 40 weight in the winter, 50 in the summer.

He claims that he is running 50 weight in AZ and really hot (compared to
what you are saying) and that us WA folks are scared of our oil tempetures.
So I am going to try 50 weight, and all out on I-5 without a oil sensing
gauge -- in this July heat we are having and see what happens.  Sorry I
missed the Vintage show.

-Wayne
