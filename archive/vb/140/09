Subject: Cascade Kombi Seattle show

Hey, finally made it to a show in my neighborhood after missing Puyallup
earlier this year. It was sad I missed the actual show because I was down
below hawking my wares at the swap meet and couldn't leave my truck till the
end. I was able to get a face to face with Dave Mayes finally and present
him with the long awaited used drag link from my 67 SC. He was totally
uninterested in a nicer set of hubcaps for Tipper though, hmmm, have to
think on that one. I totally forgot to ask him if he had found his three
visor screws. Thumper was more than willing to be a donor considering
someone busted my right side visor off two weeks ago. Dave, if you still
need them, I'll slip them into an envelope to your Pmail address.

It was quite obvious I knew nothing of the value of body parts. I'm an
engine man. So when I stated a price, they threw the money at me and ran off
cackling like they had robbed a bank. Hmmm, I'll have to re-evaluate my
position here too. I did get a couple of engine jobs, and no Clara, I didn't
sell your 40hp I promised you. I'm holding out for the front torsion bars.

There was a primer gray DD up on the east hill of Kent Sunday with a loaded
roof rack and bicycles I drove by. I wonder if they are on the list? Anyway,
Got some nice Tie Dyed cloths from a booth near me and VW trends took a
picture of my custom aluminum roof rack and ladder on my SC.
