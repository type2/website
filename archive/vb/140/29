Hi everyone,
     I finally am ready to put the  57 together to send out for the finishing 
bodywork and I was looking at the wire harness. Since I am doing everything 
else I might as well replace it and is there a good source for them? I found 
a few places but they will need to be "modified" to fit.  Also would anyone 
have: : 
          
                        The piece that holds the early fuse holder to the 
front skin frame,  mine had the front section replaced at one time and the 
holder for the fuses is the later style located to the left of where mine in 
suppose to be, that support piece towards the pass side ( I hope I explained 
it ok)

                         Piece that holds the brake arm to the shaft on the 
frame
                        
                         Divider section by gas tank /underneath bed

                        Support piece for the bed that goes above the divider 
section

                        Turn signal "holder" the u shaped piece that holds 
the bubble lights 
                        to the body

                        Center brakelight/assembly------plate light assembly

                        Lisc plate holder

                        battery hold down strap (12 volts)

 P.S. Any good VW shops in the Chicago area?
                       
                                                                              
     Steve 57 singlecab (early)
