My '64 DC certainly has plenty of space back there (out of site, for 
emergency use).  Enough room for a large box with extra distributor, 
throttle and clutch cables, belt, fuel pump, small (tire) air compressor, 
etc.... and another box with tow strap, come-along, jumper cables, 
etc....  Plenty of room is left directly under the seat for battery box, 
tool box and other junk.

The last time I moved, I removed the seat frame and seat and had space for 
phenomenal cargo, also...
