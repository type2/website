Hi Steve,
To remove the knob to remove/replace the heater cable you unscrew the knurled 
collar below/behind the knob.  Punching the pin that hold the knob will only 
result in broken knob.  BTDT!  Check out the 1963-67 bus shop manual section 
M-5, pages 6 & 7 for must more complete instructions and four dandy images.  
As for any for sale you need to figure out if you have the si;ver gray knob 
or the black one.
