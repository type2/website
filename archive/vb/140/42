First I must say the Binz is quite a score!

>The tag reads as follows from top to bottom:

Comparing it with the tag in 
http://www.type2.com/library/images/steveh9.jpg :

>1750

Heat output in kilocalories per hour

>6

Voltage

>Benzin

Fuel (gasoline)

>~~S 015

"Testing mark" (I think this means it conforms to German standards) 

>8573

"Apparatus Number"  (With this you should be able to figure out the
  model number, but I don't know if there's a translation table
  anywhere.)  

>1561

"Factory Number"  (I think this is the serial number of the heater)

>(next box is blank)

So is the one in the picture.

Rick Taylor seems to be a good gas-heater guy; he put on a seminar
about them up in Kansas City.  He's on the list and will probably
be chiming in shortly.  :)
