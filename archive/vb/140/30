OK
So I believe those to be the correct #s.
Belts.
I know the 10mm contis come in 905 and 900, I see the orig porsche belt is
825. From the previous belt post It seems like we would ideally find
865-875mm x 10mm from continental.
Does anyone have a continental belt full catalog?
FWIW
you can get the 3 pulley parts for around 40.00 from either stoddard or
parts obsolete (thank ronnie for all the links). or 50 from pelican.
