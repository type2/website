Subject: re:radio speaker

I got a replacement speaker at radio shack. fits in the exact holes as my
original-no drilling required. not sure how great the potential sound is as
my radio is very crackly and staticky-i was thinking of spraying some of
that stuff that is supposed to clean the contacts inside the volume knob-or
i have another radio that may work, is also 6 volt i think, i just need to
clean it up a bit, and maybe i will have a normal on/off switch instead of
the auxiliary one i have hooked up now....
