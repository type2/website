Subject: '59 Single Cab....KHM speedo!

My '59 Single Cab is a European model with semaphores instead of blinkers. 
I plan on installing just blade bumpers. I thought it'd be cool to get a 
KHM speedometer as well. Not really as functional for driving...but 
hey..it'd be cool and give me some kinda bragging rights I guess.

I looked around for a while and finally scored a very clean and nice bus 
one for a '60 off of eBay for $45.00 shipped. Came straight from Finland!!! 
Funny the kind of stuff that makes you happy.

On a simular note, when the British guy took delivery of my '59 Kombi, I 
asked him if he wanted me to take him for a ride in it first to show him 
some of the tricks to driving it....he said yeah and pulled open the 
drivers door and hopped in. I figured he wanted to drive. But it was 
actually just a mistake. He by habit was hopping into the passenger seat of 
a RHD bus. Pretty funny.
