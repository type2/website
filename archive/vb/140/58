Hi Joshua,
We bought them from our FLAPS called Cut Rate Auto Parts.  They said there 
was a inbetween size, but did not have it in stock.  Next time we are in 
there will order one of this mid size and see what ratio results and if any 
change in cooling ability compared to the 2.75+ ratio we are now running.
  BTW does anyone have a particular engine RPM in mind where cooling fans 
tend to explode?
  If you know of someone who had this happen do you know what size lower 
pulley of better yet ratio used?
  We have heard often this fan explode limit was well over the 5,000 engine 
RPM.

Keeping cool with type 4 cooler in doghouse shroud with Porsche generator 
pulley and knowing how much it really cools due to having guages instead of 
just guessing!  ;-)
