... how does one go about checking whether a cam bore is aligned properly?
is there a spec of how far off parallell to the case half it can be?
anything i need besides a steel straitedge?

That question has been around a long time, but mostly the hot rodders know
the answer. Back in the late 70's and early eighties when they started
messing with Chevy rods, type IV, porche, and Chevy mains, there came a
question of clearance. I beam and H beam rods were thinner and didn't force
the engine builder to move everything else around, but the larger
components, including Hi lobe race cams proved to be a serious clearance
problem. 

Generally, you are allowed 3 degrees tilt max on any one lifter. The pushrod
riding in the cup of the lifter tilts farther and farther towards the lip of
the lifter cup as it travels upward and centers as it reaches the farthest
point down. With a tilt to the lifter, this pushrod to lifter lip distance
becomes narrower. 

Oh, I forgot to answer your question.
1) slip in a lifter and wiggle, if there is play then that bore, and block,
is done for, if you don't know a good magnesium/aluminum welder who can fix
it for you.

2) with all four lifters in, place a steel straight edge across the top of
them and then shine a light across them to see if there is a gap on one side
or the other. make sure you use flat top lifters, not new or reground
because they are high in the center. an old dished lifter will do also
because the dish is usually uniform because the lifter spins in the bore
when the cam strikes it.

3) place a feeler gauge in the gap if present. You are allowed .001-.003
inches max. Don't ask me how they figured this, I got the numbers from Gene
in 78, and if you could figure something out mathematically, Gene could give
you the numbers.

That's all the info I have on lifter factory bores.
