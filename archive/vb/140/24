Subject: re:dim headlights/voltage ?'s (plus trip to canada)

not sure if you all remember bu i was working on getting the voltage up
closer to 6 at my headlight assembly. just an update post. i have been doing
a bunch of other things trying to keep this in the back of my mind turnign
over and over...

some suggestions included replacing the three prong headlight connector. i
have been to 6 different FLAPS, either they do not have them(most of the
real FLAPS) or they have them and they use really thin wire(most of the
autoz*ne type places) i found one place in england that sells something you
can put together yourself...they prvide the plastc thing and three clips-you
just need to crimp your wire ends on. aside from ordering this stuff from
england(seems kind of silly for a relatively simple/common part) anyone know
where to get a decent version of this thing?

thanks

ps i am off on another trip-this time north to canada. probably leaving
tomorrow, but maybe late this afternoon. boston to london, ontario. wedding
up there this weekend.

so if you see a white kombi w/roof rack wave hello...

anyone live nar that route(i think it is basically route 90 across NY to
niagara...
