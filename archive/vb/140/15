Hi Oldscholvw,
We looked at that and it seemed the offset of the pulley to its enter was 
such as to cause the forward side of the pulley to rub engine tin badly.  
Also this would ruin the crank/generator pulleys alignment.  Would be nice if 
it worked, the 53-54 VWs used a bigger 2.1:1 ratio lower pulley with the 36HP 
and later thin belt if memory serves correctly.
