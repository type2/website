Subject: westy panels - flip seat

List,
I just got done installing the new book ended birch door panels and front
kick panels that Clara made for my 61 flip seat (Jon's old "shinny bus").
Tomorrow I will be installing the roof panels. I must admit Clara does
excellent work!!! I had seen here gray hard board panels at the local shows
and liked what I saw, so I decided to see if she was up to the task of
making me a set out of birch as per the original specs. Not only do they fit
perfect but the quality of wood and finish she applied to them makes them
look like pieces of fine furniture you would expect to see in your
grandmothers living room.
For those of you that saw the panels in here swap area at the Vintage meet,
you can all attest to this, for those that didn't I am sorry you missed
them. I know she has taken pictures of them though and I plan on taking some
once the installation is complete. Thanks Clara, I will be in touch in a
week or two for the last few I need to get.

Anyway now that I am putting them in and am carefully lining the new screw
holes up with the original holes, I realize I still need 11 original screws
and 13 of the aluminum grommets to complete the installation.
I also need a set of door handle trim rings, the  plastic protectors that go
underneath of the trim rings and a set of springs (I think) for the door
handles. If anyone can help me out it would be appreciated. Cash or other
parts are available for them.

Also this is a long shot but does anyone out there have a table leg and or
table top for a flip seat they would be willing to part with?
Thanks again
Shawn
