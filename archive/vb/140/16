Again, Stoddard Imports (Ohio), Pelican Parts (cali), Tweeks (part of real
source),Parts Obsolete (Oregon), The Parts Shop, 356 Limited, Bernie Bergman
and I think Gene Berg. You can also order from any Porsche dealer as this is
in there NLA (something VW should do) parts program. I will look in my
Porsche book for the part numbers, yes they come inner pulley, outer pulley
and the hub, 3 pieces. You can buy each piece seperate

Hi Andy,
We have not been able to find a source for the Porsche generator pulley yet.

Perhaps Ronnie will have connections in the direction!  As for belt size
Matt 
Roberds kindly deciphered the belt numbers we tried below.

Snip> Stock 905 mm  35.6 in (Will not work with Porsche upper pulley!)
Fresh Start 13345 10AV0875  875 mm  34.4 in (Results in 2.4:1 ratio, but had

only about half the Porsche spacers between the pulley halfs.)
Gates       7340      864 mm  34.0 in  (Results in 2.75+:1 ratio, but 
requires additional Porsche or VW shims between pulley halfs to be not too 
darned tight.) <Unsnip
