Probably, but you should be able to use the Rabbit reservoir as
Ray mentioned.  I put a bay-window dual-circuit MC on my '64 and
the Rabbit reservoir from the junkyard plugged right in.  As a
bonus, the cap on some of the Rabbit reservoirs has a float switch
that you can wire to an idiot light if you're so inclined.

If your junkyard reservoir is cruddy, rinse it out with some fresh
brake fluid or denatured alcohol, let it dry out well, and then
install it.  Put a little fresh brake fluid on the reservoir outlets
and they'll slip right in to the MC seals.

Depending on how O it is, this might not be such a good deal.  Are
you planning to rebuild it before putting it into service?  Read
page B-9 3 of your Bentley manual and think about it.  Going is
optional, stopping is mandatory.  :)
