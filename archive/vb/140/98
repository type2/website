Subject: Call for HELP, Rochester, New York

 Kevin Guarnotta [kguarnotta(-at-)usa.net], known on most list just called me and
is having charging problems in his bus. It is still 6 volt and his generator
light just came on, he is on his way to Canada. He is currently on Hwy 90?
30 miles EAST of Rochester, New York. His belt is OK so it's either his
generator or regulator. If anybody is in the area, he could really use some
help.
