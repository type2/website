Subject: Heater knob - busted!

I had to remove my heater cable on my '65 DC to weld in a heater cable tube
that got ripped-off the truck somehow. While trying to remove my heater
knob, I busted it to pieces. I was trying to be carefull and used the right
size punch but, its hard to hit the punch while keeping it aligned correctly
so it won't shatter the knob.

Does anyone have any tips on how to get this thing off without busting it?
Also, does anyone have one that is intact for sale?
