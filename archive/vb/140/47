The "Electronic data catalogue" at 
http://www.contitech.de/ct/contitech/themen/produkte/antriebsriemen/kfz_ersatz/download_e.html
might be what you want.  I can't tell because I don't do Windows. 

Looking around for other manufacturers of AVX10-profile belts,
the standard sizes in your range seem to be 850, 864, 875, and 888 mm.
