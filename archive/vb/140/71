Hi Steve,
Good question!  The ACVW upright engine is a WWII device that was somewhat 
slightly redesigned in the early 1960s.  Your VW VR6 engine has what probably 
50 or 60 years of improved technology in design?  The ACVW has a cooling 
system that not only is 25 times less efficent compared by square inch/cm 
surface cooling area to water cooling, but does not run a stock full flow oil 
filter.  Additionally because the ACVW heads do not run water through them 
they have hotter spots in them to cook oil to a less lubricating condition.  
If you ever have seen the inside rocker arm areas of the aluminum heads 
blackish coated this is the result of cooking oil much like cooking grease to 
coat a cast iron pan to a nice black finish.
  Somewhat the same results happened to the type 4 engine in 1972-79 buses.  
Back when the national speed limit was 55 MPH these buses got 200,000 miles 
between rebuilds with ease if maintained properly and often could reach 
300,000+ miles.  Ever since the abolishment of the 55 MPH speed limit there 
has been nothing but trouble for these engines and rebuild or at least major 
repairs to the heads/cylinders often at about 120,000.  The only change was 
higher RPMs and thusly higher engine temps!
  Interestingly we just saw a "Modern Marvels" show on proving grounds.  
Seems there is an Army base near Yuma AZ that heat tests military equipment, 
especially vehicles.  They take prototype trucks and load them and drive them 
in 130F outside temp up a certain steep incline.  The coolant temp can not 
exceed 220F or the prototype truck has to be redesigned by the supplier to 
meet this limit!
