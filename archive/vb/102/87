Subject: was Re: [VB] Grrr  Westfakia!  now its two tone westys

Why is it so hard for anyone to accept that this is a
westy? Why is there so many that think its a hack?
Because it has one jaulosie window?? Didnt dormobiles
come with one popout, one stationary, and one
jalousie? You guys never seen two tones westys before?
I don't own the bus, don't live near the bus, never
seen anymore of the bus then what is on the ad, but it
gripes me that everyone thinks its a fake. I thought
we were more educated than that.
