<< Volks,
 
 I bought a new brake switch because my new master cylinder was exerting
 too much pressure on it, or so I thought.  I ride my bike to work and
 when I got home yesterday there she was, sitting under the carport with
 the brake lights on.  I had to take out the far left fuse to get them to
 go off.  What is going on here?  I can't soften up the push rod in the
 master cylinder any softer, or my brakes will be down too low.
 
 What gives?  Any ideas?

there is a little sender screwed into your master cylinder.   go under the 
bus with you test light and find the master cylinder.  ground the test light, 
and see those two wires plugged into the sender?   one of them should be hot. 
  Your fuse is back in. right, ok  so pull one of the wires off the sender, 
and test to see if it is hot?   test the other one, it should not be hot.  
leave the hot one plugged into the sender, and test to see if the other side 
of the sender gets electricity.  It should not.  pull the brake lever down 
with you other hand, now it should be hot.

I think your sender is stuck on, and you probably need a new one.  think they 
are about $3, good thing to have a spare of around.
