I gave Gary Miller from Miller FI a call today and left a message that I was
looking for his vanished web page.  His new link is

http://www.sandrail.com/millerfi/
I think David and a few others have been looking for Gary over the last few
months.

He was having trouble with his web host and moved shop over to sandrail.  Seems
like a synergistic combination.

For those that don't know, Miller FI is the outfit that makes CIS FI systems for
type I and type IV motors.

I have a CIS FI system on my 2L Type IV and it hasn't given me a hint of trouble
in the over 20K miles I have on it to date.
