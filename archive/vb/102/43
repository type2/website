I have seen many euro westfalia's retroactively retroffited with a NA =
issue  "Hehr" jalousie window. I believe that euro westy's came with =
standard VW pop outs as the jalousie windows were perceived as a safety =
hazard in Europe- so owners have take it upon themselves to substititue a =
jalousie window when they get their hands on it. Note as well on this bus =
it appears to have the european stlye mirror on the pass. side arms. Would =
be interesting to see what kind of tailights it has on it. Definately a =
mixed breed just hard to say if it started out life as a standard or a =
westy.

    The ONE jalousie window doesn't make sense.  Halfway swap over is what =
