Subject: Re: [VB] should I feel bad or good

Hiya gang,
Been trying to follow this thread.  It's a double-edged sword for a lot of
people.

Personally, I'd be flattered if someone posted pictures of my restored 67
Sundial on their site.

But on the other hand, are we moving towards site owners needing a signed
release from a bus owner in order to post, or even take pictures of their
buses?

Don't know about the legal implications, but if someone is not profiting
from a picture of your bus being on their web site, what's the harm?

On the other hand, if someone is putting portions of your web site on their
web site, seems like the common sense approach would dictate that they get
the site owner's permission before doing this.

I don't own a site, but I got a boner once when I saw a picture of my newly
restored bus on Everett's site, so I'm not sure what the solution is.
