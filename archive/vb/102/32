Subject: RE: [VB] My wiper blades suck

  I have found thet the SKF OG blades last around 1 year, in Havasu about a
month, before they split and at 20 to 30 dollars a piece it isn't worth it.
I would have to take them off the make them last. The repops I sell (12
dollars a piece) I wish I could buy them cheaper but the guy that makes them
kinda gouges these being he is the only one making them (his bug blades are
half as much), seem to last longer but I don't know how long. I know of a
couple people that have had them on there buses since I started selling them
18 months ago and they are still holding up

Hi Rich,
I think the problem is a mixture of things.  First off, it may be my
imagination, but wiper blades for all vehicles seem to not last very well
any more.  Second thing to check is the spring tension in the arm.  I had
this problem once.  New springs or new arms may hold the blade to the
window with a little more force.  I think new blades are about $20 each
here.  Crazy.  Ronnie, how about some cheap repops?  $20 for a year or two
is too much.  Being a cheap-assed bus person I just run the driver's side.
The passenger side arm fell off and I thought, hey this will save wiper
costs.
