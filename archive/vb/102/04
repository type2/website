Good point.
I have found that by not adding my last name to my gallery submissions I get
lumped in with that Greg Noble character (just kidding Greg) and his 624+
pictures. So for the last couple days I have been resubmitting my pictures, and
at the same time bettering mt rating as a "contributor" on Everetts site. I
guess Thom's is next.

I think asking first is always the way to go. It's just polite.
