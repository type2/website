Subject: Bentley Workshop Manual...invaluable!

Hello, All....
Recently, I posted a question about the repair of loose
lower front door hinges. I received many responses (thanks
to all!) and Eric&Barb suggested I consult a passage in the
Bentley Workshop Manual for details.  Well, I didn't have the
manual... but with a quick call to Ronnie, I am now the proud
owner of the most valuable piece of reference material about
our buses...bar none!  I have been drooling over the pages for
hours (I received it this afternoon) and it has answered many
of my nagging questions. This has been the best $75(plus
shipping) I ever spent on my bus. I just had to tell someone... 
:)
