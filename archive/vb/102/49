Perhaps this is for a so-called "City Light"?
Its a small light that lights the globe of the light without being
obnoxious.  It doesnt /provide/ much light, but it makes you visible from
the front....useful as DRLs or cruising around well-lit areas without
spotlighting people.  (and for camp grounds! :)


Of course, we splitty owners have city lights built in to our parking
light systems...but other cars dont.

(it's my understanding that City Lights are a bit of a euro thing.)
