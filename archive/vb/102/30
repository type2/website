No, this is 100% wrong.  If I look at a photo in the newspaper of a car
accident scene, did the newspaper get permission from everyone pictured
in order to print that photo?  No.

my bus that I didnt give someone permission to take.

I was referring to photos I take with my camera.  Just to clarify, the ma=

manuals are, i.e. no copyright notice.  No copyright notice before 1974
(approx., I didn't spend the time to go look it up) =3D no copyright.

Actually the poster is probably not copyrighted.  I don't think stealing
an image of the poster is wrong if he scanned it, probably just rude.  If=

he took a photo of the poster, then the photo is his property, no matter
what it depicts.  Now if he takes a photo of something that is copyrighte=

or trademarked and then uses that photo to make money, that, of course,
would be a problem.

Which ones?  If this concerns you, you should contact the advertiser with=

the "stolen" VW images and warn them.
