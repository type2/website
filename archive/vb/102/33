I think it just comes down to common courtesy.  If someone takes a photo
of my Bus anywhere, at a show, in front of my house, etc., and I see it
posted somewhere, I should expect to have the right to have it removed if=

I don't like it, it's my Bus.

I've removed photos from my site as the owner's request or made modificat=
ions
like blanking out the license plate, it's no problem.  I also have a lot
of digital photos that are for private use only - Buses stored in owner's=

garages, people's back yards full of parts, etc..
