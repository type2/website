>>Actually the poster is probably not copyrighted.  I don't think stealing
an image of the poster is wrong if he scanned it, probably just rude.  If
he took a photo of the poster, then the photo is his property, no matter
what it depicts.  Now if he takes a photo of something that is copyrighted
or trademarked and then uses that photo to make money, that, of course,
would be a problem.>>


The image of the poster was taken with a camera... I don't have a scanner
that big.
