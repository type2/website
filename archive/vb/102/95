 Hi Chris,
 Then you need to find a pre-1964 40 HP air cleaner and its triangle bracket 
 to mount it to the coil mounting bolts.  You will also have to make a small 
 adapter bracket to allow the earlier air cleaner to connect to the traingle 
 bracket on 1300cc and later engines.  This is due to the slight shift to the 
 left of the intake center manifold section that the carburetor mounts to on 
 later engines so the carburetor could easily clear the generator.

 you can mount the 1500 air cleaner on the left- it clips right on to the 40 
hp air cleaner tubing (need triangle).  If you get the 63/earlier 1500 
aircleaner the breather hole is oriented to the right which make it easier to 
connect a tube to the gen stand.
