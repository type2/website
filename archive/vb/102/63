All,

Another good copyright resource is Terry Carrol's Copyright FAQ, at:

http://www.faqs.org/faqs/law/copyright/faq/part1/

It hasn't been updated since 1994, but most of the material in it
still applies.  Probably the biggest change in copyright law that
isn't covered is the Digital Millenium Copyright Act[1] or DMCA.

    can buy.
