The solution is simple, ASK permission to use the the content.  It does two
things.  It lets that person know your site exists and they may find or know of
other stuff for your site to use.  I for example have found a few things on
Everette's and Wade's site, asked permission, been granted and have since
received all kinds of stuff from Wade for my site.  I haven't posted or
contributed much to anybody else's site a few here or there, but know where some
of the Double and Single cabs are in my area and will one day get around to
submitting pics of them to Wade's site.

Brian, you are a smart guy, your building your own site, but why would you not
want to be courteous to the people who have already done the work of putting it
up on the net.  It takes less than a minute to say, "hey I'm building a Wheel
site, and want to use your pic, cool.  Nobody is going to say No, we are all
curious about what you find and to see a collection of all the old options out
there.  I keep a draft copy of my little "hey can I use this pic" letter in my
email for just such an occasion.   So why not take the ten seconds to ask for
permission and you would be amazed at the kind of outpouring of support you get
from this group and others.  Who knows maybe that wheel you are looking for
somebody here has, but now won't post because of your attitude here.  We all
loose, cause we aren't going to see it on your site.  My site is less related to
our hobby than yours, but everybody here has different interests and come across
stuff all the time and are willing to share.  All it comes down to is common
courtesy.
