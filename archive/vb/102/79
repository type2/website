Hi Chris,
We are running a SP1641cc CW engine in our 1960 panel camper conversion with 
40 HP air cleaner.  Definitely one has to do some jetting to make a smaller 
air cleaner work with a bigger engine so it does not run too rich.  Even if 
one moved a 1600cc engine with 1968-71 air cleaner directly into a pre-1968 
bus, one would still have to work on the jetting to make up for the 
differance in how the engine compartments are intake air vented differantly.
