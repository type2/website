Subject: Re: [VB] should I feel bad or good

A)David,  maybe you should ask "randawg", the one who originally Kojacked
your images and put them on everetts site. I don't know what his problem
is. I *graciously* offered to post a BIG ass picture of his camo Doublecab
slapped across the main page of my site when it got stolen from him, which
I did along with his stolen info and ran it there for more then a few
weeks. Then he returned the favor by stealing images off my site and
uploading them to thesamba.com? wtf?!?!???????? So I had the images removed
from everetts site but then randawg recently re-uploaded them *again*! I
never got a 'thank you' for running his DC on the front page of my site,
and I didnt expect one, but having the pictures that I snapped and
scanned - stolen and upped to other sites was NOT what I had in mind.
yah buddy, your welcome.
Its not like hes propping his *own* site by upping cool images along with
his web addy, he doesn't even have one.

B)Is there a prop war going on? Are people wanting props THAT badly that
they have to go around stealing images from other peoples site just so they
can have a high number by their name in the "contributors listing"? Is
there a prize or something? Does anyone sit around and go damn I wish I was
that guy that has uploaded 400 images?? I know other images have been
stolen from my site and upped to thesamba, but they aren't "mine" since
they were photographed and submitted to me by someone else, so I do
nothing. How do I know they were from my site? I make a small mark or
alteration on them before i post them, for fun when I first get them, just
to see what other sites they venture off to and sure enuff. People have
also emailed me and said "i have such and such truck, there are pics of it
on so and so's site, go ahead and grab them". I guess when/if the webmaster
comes down on me, i will just refer them to picture owner. Still makes me
weary.

C)On the other hand there is no way for other sites to know if the unmarked
image was stolen from your site, so all you can do is tell them. I have
been emailed a couple times from people saying 'that is my image" so I
either remove it, prop them, or whatever they want. Typically I was sent
the image by other people and I figured it was theirs originally.
Name your images weird names and then after a few months run searches on
them. People are stupid and leave the same filenames on the images. You
will find your images and more, somewhere else. I found a site before that
said " these are cool VW's that I have seen and would like to own" or
something like that. He had 23 images, 21 of the images were photos I had
snapped and scanned.
 I get emailed images all the time which i already know for a FACT are from
certain sites, taken by that webmaster, so I dont post them. Webmasters go
to the same sites everyone else does. duh.

D)David, you put *my* scan of my bed slat screws on your website without
propping me or asking me or putting my name! Should I feel bad or good?
heheh

E)any picture can be stolen no matter what method is used to protect it.
But if someone went thru all the trouble to scan a whole manual or
something which is for YOUR benefit, why would you steal and upload it to
someone elses site or put it on your own? If everyone has the same images
on there site, whats the point. Think about it, webmasters are
'entertainers' in a way. They spend all their time (and quite often their
money for hosting and etc) making something they think others will enjoy,
and typically trying to have a fresh unseen material, yet they get
backstabbed by thievery. sick sad world. I do however agree with thom, Ebay
is fair game unless otherwise noted.

F)why am I lettering each paragraph? because everyone else was using
numbers and I want my 'props'.

-Wade
all in jest
