Hi Rich,
For any wiper it is a good idea to wash and scrub the wipers just before the 
wet season starts with a tooth brush.  Spring pressure is important and so is 
even flexing of the blade as it swipes side to side.  Without even flexing 
the blade can often pogo in one direction in such a way as to not wipe water 
at all.  Reducing the effectiveness by half.  If you windshield glass is 
heavily scratched the water will cling and not bead up on it which makes it 
far harder to wipe it off.  Also makes it hard to see at night with on coming 
traffic even without rain!  From what we have heard C-J jeep blades will work 
on bus wiper arms.
