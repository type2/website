it is NOT your imagination - smog and ozone in most major cities are so bad
that rubber  parts are disintegrating at a rate of knots!
when i lived in houston, i was lucky to get 6 months out of wipers, and
that was years BEFORE Dear Ol Georgiepie our former guv made it the most
polluted city in america.

here in austin, my new window rubber has begun to split after 4 years on the 70.

True Story: when i first moved to houston, my girlfriend's dad said:
"nowah, if ya'll go ahtsahd in the moanin and see littul gray specks on
youah cah, don leave em thar... it'll et the paint off."

i bought the bus and got a driver's license at the age of 25 to get OUT of
houston...........
