Subject: Re: [VB] Jalosy vs. EZ windows was Kill copyright/web-geek thread?

That's pretty good! Jealousy vs. envy type windows may be the question that 
leads to the down fall of man!:) Anyway, the subject of camper windows is 
very much on the forefront of my restoration project on my '62 EZ Camper 
right now. I have a set of 5 HEHR windows that came on both EZ and Sundial 
camper conversions, I don't know what to call them, (jealousy or envy?) I 
believe that jalosy windows are the louvered windows with 3 or 4 separate 
panes, correct me if I am wrong? I my assumptions are right, I do not have 
those, but I have the single hinge windows that have the operator track 
running down the middle of the single pane of glass.

What I am hoping to find out is:

1. Should I fix all the operators of this set of windows? Or should I trade 
them or buy a set of functional jalosy louvered type windows to use in their 
place? Are the windows that I have rare?

2. Does anyone know where I can get the hardware to fix these windows? I 
have a couple leads but I would like to hear what the list has to say.

This will really help me to make a decision about what I should do.

Thanks,
Joshua
'62 EZ
