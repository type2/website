Hi Tom,
  Do not focus on just one jet!  Try a 125 main jet, g 60 pilot jet, and 60 Z 
air correction jet.  These jets are for a stock 1971 DP bus so if you are 
using a pre-1968 air cleaner you will have to adjust these jets for a little 
leaner running.  If you have to us a 009 distributor stacic time it for 7.5 
BTDC.  This should result in 28 to 30 degrees total BTDC at about 3,000 RPM.  
Also what RPMs are you doing (-at-) 45 MPH?
