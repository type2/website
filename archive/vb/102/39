ya- that bus seems to have an original interior there, and carefully doesn't 
show headliner-   

 I have heard that once in a rare while westys were made from standards,  
Though it's much more likely that someone hacked in a flip top, and installed 
the kit.  You could buy kits for installing yourself back in the day, make 
your standard a 'westy'.        
    The ONE jalousie window doesn't make sense.  Halfway swap over is what it 
implies.  Seen them w/ 5 (with solid in the closet) or with the regular 4 
solids 2/ popouts, but any mix and match jalousie and popout was home grown.

volksnutsguy(-at-)yahoo.com (Brian Bergesen) said he could go look at it- cool, 
check out the M code tag.   remnants of glue around windows from headliner on 
sides in back of bus?   Wiring for interior side lights new or old?
