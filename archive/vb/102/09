I just deciphered the faded part of my bus above the
tail light to read as the title of this email states.
I have always noticed the dull remnants of some sorts,
but only tonight have I solved my mystery. Anyways, I
would like info about the dealer if anyone knows
anything I guess. See a photo? Are they still around?
Tag Frames?
 Mike
