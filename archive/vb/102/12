Subject: Re: [VB] My wiper blades suck

I heard about this trick on TV or somewhere. When blades start to streak,
its usually due to a build-up of oil and dirt on the blade, it usually isn't
due to the blades wearing-out.

Put some lacquer thinner or fingernail polish on a rag and wipe the blade
edge with it. You should see a lot of crud come off and this usually stops
the blade from streaking. Of course, if the blade is cracked or otherwise
damaged, it is time to change blades.
