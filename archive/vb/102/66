You need to talk to Curt Conklin.  His brake lights are on all
the time.  I think he might have stolen all the photons out of
your tail-light bulbs.  I don't know about your horn and turn
signals; if somebody posts in the next few days that their horn
or turn signal goes all the time, you should check with them.
You engraved your Bus' VIN on each photon, right?  

:)

Six fuses, right?  The leftmost one (hot all the time) should be 
for horn and interior lights, and the second-from-left (hot with
key on) should be the brake lights and turn signals.  If you can
start the engine, the feed end of both of those fuses should be
getting power.  Grab a test light and check both ends of these
two fuses.  If your high beams and tail lights work, the right
four fuses in your fuse box should be OK, so you can substitute
them for testing purposes.

At a guess I'd say it's probably bad connections right where the 
wires attach to the fuse block.

Stock, no.  After 40 years of DPO creativity, who knows.
