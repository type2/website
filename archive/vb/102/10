Not really. A fellow list member said this was a good way to get peoples
attention though.

Seriously, since it seems that a few people might be on the road to go to
shows this weekend, I thought someone would look-out for a cargo door latch
(the locking side) for sale.

If you see one, I need it and if it is in good working condition, I will
definitely buy it from you. Don't care about the inside or outside handle, I
just need the latch. Its for my '65 crew cab.

Who knows, what you make on it might pay for a six pack or so.

Hope you all have good and safe trips!
