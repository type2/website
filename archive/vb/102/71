Sounds like a vacume leak when the carb heats up and then the joints expand.
Probably a Brosol 30/31 replacement carb. You can fix it but you'll have to
buy a rebuild kit and check two things. 1) good flat surface between bowl
cover and bowl
2) good tight choke and throttle plate shafts after hot. Mostly the throttle
plate and will require it to be rebushed. Probably cheaper to get another
carb.

Oh, while you are in there, pull out that 112-117 main jet and put in a 130
if you plan on driving on the highway, around town the lean jet doesn't make
too much difference.

Hello All

            

            I have a 1600sp engine that came with my bus. It runs well
when you first start it up but after a few minutes it dies and won't
keep idle. The engine if kept at a fixed RPM with my hand on the
throttle will eventually die.  I checked the idle switch on the side and
appears to be working.
