FYI ; any photograph that is taken by a person can be copywritten by that
person Unless the subject or owner of the subject (given that the subject is
not a copywritten object 1st) in the photograph has not given permission to
have the photo taken.

Has everyone who takes pics of VWs at kelly park or The bug jam ask the
owner first before they take the picture or post it to their web site. there
is no difference in that than copying one off the web.

That is an entirely different matter.  Your bus is yours, your bought it,
you invested into it, you spent money, restored it, made it entirely your
"creation" your personal property that you paid for.
 A scaned image of a 1962 brochure is not anyones, Unless of course the
rights to it have been bought from Volkswagen. Nor is a scaned picture of my
bus that I didnt give someone permission to take.

I guess i still dont understand,
If Dave can infringe on VWs copyright by copying a volkswagen poster and the
putting it on the web to PROMOTE  the sale of his items(a clear voilation of
the copyright law), using a trademark VW emage to make money, then why is it
wrong for me to use that image, He didnt create that image , he just uses it
to make money.

 As for the samba.com,  The banner ads on it use Trademark VW images, doesnt
that constitute "stealing" a copywritten image? Isnt that doing the same as
what i am accused of doing? If not worse because money is being made.

This whole thing sound like a spinoff of VWOAs complaint.
