Hello All

            

            I have a 1600sp engine that came with my bus. It runs well
when you first start it up but after a few minutes it dies and won't
keep idle. The engine if kept at a fixed RPM with my hand on the
throttle will eventually die.  I checked the idle switch on the side and
appears to be working.
