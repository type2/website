Subject: RE: [VB] My wiper blades suck

If you are looking for a functional, economical wiper blade alternative, I
modified a pair of wiper arms to accept the hook style bug blades. I cut the
hooks off of a pair of arms I had and heli-arc welded them to a pair of bus
arms (which I shortened slightly to get the right length). I can now use the
relatively cheap bug blades, which also work better than the stock blades.
If you really want the stock blades for show, keep two sets, one for show,
one to go.
