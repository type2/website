Subject: this bus was likenew...

I cant believe it !!

look at Item # 1818673518

this guy say "this bos was like new when it was parked 4 years ago"  and
"the rest is surfice rust mite need little carb work.and needs paint "

if it was looking like new 4 years ago, god it perished a lot in 4 years!!

bwaahahahaha

This is the same as i bought a Dogleg (from a 59 van) advertised on Everett
site, it was advertised NO RUST, than i bought it fo 60 $ + ship,  okay it
still a nice dogleg, but it has a hole in it and enough rust  to avoid the
term  NO RUST, i feel i was bit crooked, next time ill wait for a picture,
dont assume it is the truth, too late money was sent.. 

Anyone has a driver side dogleg for a 60 bus?  im okay to pay the righ
price, in my opinion a dogleg rusted but no hole is no more than 30 $
