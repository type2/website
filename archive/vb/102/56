So this could just be a "steel wool" the connections and spin the fuses? 
As far as the fuses, can they "look good" but really have gone bad
without blowing?  Gretchen doesn't sit around all winter, it's my daily
driver.  Just really blew me away that everything is gone at once.  (Head
and taillights work though, as does the starter, of course, and the CD
player.)  Thanks for the response.
