Subject: RE: [VB] should I feel bad or good

Thanks all for commenting... I feel better.

Here are my ending thoughts:

1)  I don't mind people using my images as long as they ask first (and of
course, I agree).  Sure, it makes me feel like I've contributed and someone
noticed.  :-)

2)  Everett, You can leave the two images on your site... actually, one is
Bob Van Heysts image which I believe he posted on your site a long time ago
and the new one is simply a duplicate.  If you could, edit the description
and link my tipper page: http://www.dsquared-dev.com/davem/67tipper.htm .
Now, this brings me to a thought to myself of why I have never posted a
gallery pic to Everett's site and have only posted to Thom's site... hmmmmm.
I like them equally well and applaud them both profusely... but I digress.

3) Thanks Rachel for the link:
http://www.templetons.com/brad/copymyths.html.  The one comment I have to
make here is in regards to the image of my 'Getting ahead with Volkswagen
Trucks' poster, and like images of rare items... these fall in a gray area.
If I owned a Picasso, I can make copies of it and sell them since I own the
original.  If I own a copy, I cannot.  So where does this poster stand since
it is probably one of only a few left in the world?

4) I strongly believe that all my digital images are mine and are definitely
copyright protected.... but like I said earlier, if you want to use
something that I post, ask me and I usually am a quite a generous person.
