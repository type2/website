Hi Rich,
I think the problem is a mixture of things.  First off, it may be my
imagination, but wiper blades for all vehicles seem to not last very well
any more.  Second thing to check is the spring tension in the arm.  I had
this problem once.  New springs or new arms may hold the blade to the
window with a little more force.  I think new blades are about $20 each
here.  Crazy.  Ronnie, how about some cheap repops?  $20 for a year or two
is too much.  Being a cheap-assed bus person I just run the driver's side.
The passenger side arm fell off and I thought, hey this will save wiper
costs.
