We just like to see pics and it does not matter were they came from if they are posted at more than site more chance for us to find them. It is a hobby and just don't make money from other's work.

From a musician's point of view, it's kinda like getting one of your songs covered by a band that obviously admires you, otherwise they would not do a cover version of one of your songs. HOWEVER, if they are selling that song and making money from it, then I want my royalty check also!  So, everyone feel free to snake any of my pix, graphics, lyrics, or whatever. But if it goes on an album or a commercial advertisement, I WANT MY PIECE OF THE PIE!  FWIW,
