Subject: RE: [VB] Tell me 'bout this brake hone thing

The only problem with the hone is getting the two bushings true to each other.The factory reamer has a guide so it runs true in the top and bottom bushing.

A hone may get the job done but a reamer will do it correctly.

I have gotten some responses about reaming the swing lever pin with a "brake hone".  Can someone please tell e what this thing is and how it works?
