Subject: Re: [VB] Tent poles

Hi Everyone-

I would agree with Greg- I spent literally years looking for tent poles =
for my mid 60's striped westy tent ( I assume that Greg is talking about =
the westy tent that attaches to the side of the bus rather than the "stand =
alone" 68-> tents)  As it was I ended up buying another tent. I too =
thought about repopping tent poles but have yet to get around to doing it =
:)

So long story short if you build it they will come. I think there is a =
demand, any idea of a price range Greg?

Everyone has a tent, but no one can find poles.......... right?
Well I pose this question to the "list" Is there enough of a demand to =
have these made? I recently have come upon the means to do (make) just =
about anything metal and was thinking of making these.

Also FWIW, I'm looking for Bus spindles cores. I've made my own dropped =
spindles for awhile, but stayed away from doing them for others due to =
liabilities. I have taken care of that as well, and I'm looking for good =
cores now.
