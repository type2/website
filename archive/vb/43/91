Consider yourself lucky.  I was informed at my local office (CHP) that
they only checked VINs one day a week for one hour that specific day.
Be there or else if you make an appointment!  It was some odd ball time
like 2:30 on a Thursday.  BTW get there 1/2 hour before the appointed
hour!

OK jumped through the hoops, and they said bring it around back.  I did
and they had me pull it up on to ramps in a stall.  Then, they said
leave.  "What?" I said.  Yup.  Go out to the lobby and we'll call you.
Looked at me really strange too.  Guess they were expecting some hippie
(no offense to the hippies on the list ;-) instead of a tall white goof
ball.  Didn't find the drugs they were looking for either.

The kicker was the duffas got the number wrong and I had to end up
straightening up things with DMV later anyway.
