Subject: RE: [VB] how comfortable is a vintage bus for a large human being?

I am 6' 4" and have some minor issues with visibility in my '60. It is a
non-adjustable bench, and I find myself stooping a bit to see out the
front. I have driven a walkthrough that is much better and am
considering putting some buckets in to help out a bit. As has been
mentioned, later vehicles have an adjustable seat which really helps.

Subject: [VB] how comfortable is a vintage bus for a large human being?


In Jan., my wife and I will be outnumbered by our children, and so we
require a larger vehicle. Although an SUV is an option, neither of us
are sure that it is the best option. By a stroke of genius - ?!?! - we
thought we oughta consider a vintage bus. This would be an "every day
driver" -- and I *am* concerned about the *reliability* of an old bus;
but before this concern comes my concern that I, at 6' 5", might not fit
behind the wheel of one of these buses.

Can anyone speak to - and hopefully allay - this concern?...

Other thoughts / suggestions / advice would also be *much* appreciated.

Thanks,
Matthew Weymar
