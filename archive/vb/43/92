> well, you could go in with the vin numer to get the statement of how much back
fees are owed. if there are slot, the eassiest and best way to do it ( ive dont
this,its a good loophole) is to sell it to a junkyard and buy it right back from
them. that is only if there are ALOT of back fees..like if it was sitting
without a non op. my 62 had 300 in back fees- i sold it to a pick and pull (for
200 bucks) and bouaght it back for 250. then you get a clean salvagfe title.

A better way to get around paying back fees and not having a 'salvage' title is
to sell it to a wholesaler and then buy it back. You get a clear title that way.
