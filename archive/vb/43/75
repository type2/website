Subject: Re: [VB] steering wheel question

Hi Sergio,
Take the two steering wheels to a local machine shop and have them make a 
adapter piece or bore and adapt the aftermarket steering wheel itself.  If 
this aftermarket steering wheel is any smaller diameter expect much stiffer 
resistance to turning the wheel.  Eric&Barb
