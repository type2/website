  My bus has begun dying at stop signs, and sometimes, when I take my foot off
  the accelerator to go around a corner or just slow down the engine dies.
  This is a relatively new situation, always before it idled very well.
  The problem started when I discovered that the tube which carries the
  accelerator cable through the fan shroud had become displaced and was
  pressed up agains the carbuerator linkage. I moved the tube back to its
  correct place, but now I'm experiencing the problem above.
  Any tips?
  Thanks in Advance

 You forgot to mention what year your bus is. If its new enougn to use the 
bug 1600
 engine or whatever, you may have a bad bypass air cut-off valve. Its item 6 
in the latest RMMW catalog. Usually, the head gets knocked off (the thingy 
that exists to the far left of item 6 in the RMMW catalog) causing the engine 
to stall instead of idle. The solution is to replace the bypass air cut-off 
valve for $18.95. It screws onto the carb.

Just thought of something - a test for whether of not your bypass air cutoff 
valvve is working. Enlist a helper. Have the helper turn the key on. listen 
for a click. If the click
occurs, the bypass cutoff valve is OK. If it does not click, the valve has 
the head knocked off and is bad. Replace it in the latter case.
