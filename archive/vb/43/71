what i did with the 1648 dual port was take a dremel tool and grind material out of the chambers.  i made the two chambers in the one head as exactly alike as possible.  it was long and tedious job with me pulling the head off the bench and asking the mechanic if i was through yet only to be sent back over and over again.

when the mechanic decided that it was close, i measured the capacity of both chambers, and compared that to the math we had done which showed what the capacity needed to be for the targeted compression ratio.  if there was a large enough difference between either our figures or between the chambers, then it was back to the bench.

once the chambers were close to the target figures, i took some really fine grit sandpaper (the same that is used on crank journals) and polished the chambers "as smooth as a baby's behind" per the mechanic.  when he declared it baby-butt smooth, i then measured the capacity again.  if the measurements were off, it was back to the bench.

after i'd gotten the chambers perfectly alike and within the proper capacity for head number one, i then took the other head and did the same thing making it as close to a mirror image of the first.

it was a long and tedious project and i will never repeat the job with another set of heads; i just know that there have to be easier ways.  the positive side of the whole affair is that the mechanic and i spent very long days together while i worked on this project and that we had some great fun during this time.
