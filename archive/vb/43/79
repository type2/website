Craig,

Ah, but much to the contrary!  What about traveling bus folk??  I think we all
feel for you and your bad experience, but WHY the anonymity for the shop??!!

The only reason this list exists is to help each other AVOID problems (be it
mechanical or inter-bus-personal) that others have had.  We all read and post
hoping to glean or give some useful tips, information or the occasional smile
via a trip report or short story.  Your story, abet with a happy ending, could
help many others in your area by avoiding the shop you had such a bad
experience with!

I'm of the opinion (others may disagree) that if you have received legitimate
BAD service or parts, WHY keep your mouth shut about who is giving said crappie
service/parts.  Obviously there is the possibility of a disgruntled customer
ranting here on the list, but if he/she is just spewing vindictive comments and
there is nothing factual to back them up, others will step in to give the other
side.

Please name this awful shop and its location, so that others will not have to
go through what you did.

Steve
