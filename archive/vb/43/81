Subject: Re: [VB] Vehicle registration in Calif

Be nice and call your local CHP office and ask for the officer
who does vehicle checks.  There is an officer who's specialty
is to check vehicle ID's just for this purpose.  

I called the local CHP office, talked a bit to this officer and
arranged a time for him to come out to my house to check the bus.

He arrived on time, nice, polite, and very knowledgeable about VIN
locations.  He knew where to look on my '66.  These folks are 
usually the old car nuts on the force, and love checking out old
vehicles.  It provides a break on checking resurrected junkers
at wrecking yards.

I bought and sold the bus without ever even getting an engine
installed, so there was no way for me to drive it to the DMV.

So, call you local CHP office for assistance in verifying the ID.

Jeff  busless, wishing I had kept the '66

*****************
According to the DMV: If the vehicle ID is not in their database, you 
will need to bring the vehicle to the DMV so they can verify the ID.
