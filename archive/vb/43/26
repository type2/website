Subject: Hard to find radio parts

For those trying to find radio parts, particularly trim rings which work on
the Split Window curved dash try this guy: sven(-at-)euroautoparts.de
I had been looking for a chrome trim ring for my AM, FM, Shortwave Blaupunkt
for months and this guy sold me one for $39 with shipping from Denmark.  He
also has very nifty radios although they are pricey.  He has original knobs
etc. as well.
