Hi Adrian,
Pinging can and will happen at much higher RPMs than 1,500 RPM if the engine 
is running really hot and/or the CR is just too high or the gear is just too 
high for the grade encountered or when using a higher geared tranny (As we 
have found with our 3.875 R&P freeway flier tranny which the engine is happy 
in fourth gear above 2,000 RPM or it lugs the engine.) .  Oil temp gauge is a 
must, but having an oil pressure gauge first is best if one can not get in 
both at the same time.  The third gauge for a fifteen minute drive is to tach 
for your RPM/MPH in each forward gear for 1,500 & 3,000 RPM.    Eric&Barb
