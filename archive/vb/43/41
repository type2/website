Hi Don,
Often with aftermarket three prong signal flasher relay one has to hook two 
of the wires to one of the prongs on the realy whiel the third wire goes to a 
one of the remaining prongs.  If you can describe the markings at each prong 
you are using we might be able to help if it matches what we are using.
