In Jan., my wife and I will be outnumbered by our children, and so we =
require a larger vehicle. Although an SUV is an option, neither of us =
are sure that it is the best option. By a stroke of genius - ?!?! - we =
thought we oughta consider a vintage bus. This would be an "every day =
driver" -- and I *am* concerned about the *reliability* of an old bus; =
but before this concern comes my concern that I, at 6' 5", might not fit =
behind the wheel of one of these buses.

Can anyone speak to - and hopefully allay - this concern?...

Other thoughts / suggestions / advice would also be *much* appreciated.

Thanks,
Matthew Weymar
