Yes, this is how to mount the belt. The original poster may not be
rotating the belt out of the pulley as he tightens it, as Thom instructs
above. The amount of play for the properly adjusted belt is about
1/3" when pressed inwards from the side. I usually allow a tiny bit more
play to err on the side of saving generator bearings, but not so loose
that the belt is flopping around when hot.
