Subject: Leaky carb

Tonight when I got home I pulled the bus into the
driveway and then came in to let the dog out. I came
back out to the bus to install a new preheat hose.
When I opened the deck lid there was some gas dripping
from the carb onto the case. This alarms me. I dont
see it leak anymore, I install preheat hose then start
bus and watch for leak. I don't see it leak anymore. I
am going to switch the carb, but can anyone tell me
where my 28 pict might be leaking from, or why? 
 
 Mike
