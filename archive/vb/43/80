Subject: Heat riser seals

Are the asbestos heat riser seals (the ones that go inside the top rear
tin and small opposite piece) that surround the heat riser tube
available new??  Where?  I've always used the old ones on old tin.  I've
blasted and painted all my tin and need some new ones.

Thanks!!

Steve
