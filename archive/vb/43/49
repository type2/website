Hi John,
To get both of the bushings bore straight to each other and of the same size 
you really need a reamer.  We use a adjustable reamer with a taper attachment 
to center it's tip when going through the upper bushing inline to the lower 
bushing.  You can get both of these from a machinist supply store or even 
some better hardware stores.  Cost for our's was about $60.00, and has been 
handy many times.
