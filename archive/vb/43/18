Subject: RE: [VB] more on generator shims/belt

Sounds like you really need the John Muir book "How to Keep Your VW Alive".
Great book which it sounds like you really need.


Unless the threads on the generator shaft are screwed up either the shims
will be tight or the belt will, you got it right when both are tight
(granted the belt should have a little play when pushed, or it is too
tight).... Maybe you are pinching a shim in there?  Be sure they are lined
up perfectly before putting the outside pulley half on.


Good Luck,
