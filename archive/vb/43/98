Subject: RE: [VB] engine ID & air cleaner on a 1961

Thanks, Matt and everyone for your input on this. I will go over the engine
closer to find the numbers.

Does anyone have any idea where I might find a weighted flap valve for my
aircleaner (1961 type 2), the correct piece of rear sheet metal (1961 type 2
with air cleaner preheater opening on the left), and the correct bracket to
mount the air cleaner to the fan housing? Any leads or suggestions are
greatly appretiated!
