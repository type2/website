Subject: Interesting finds

   Today I was cutting up (oops, parting out), the 56 single cab I had just
inherited. Got the top half of the nose, windshield frames, roof, doors off
(junk) all the other junk that un bolts and proceeded to start to cut the
bed off of it (with bulkhead attached) when I was looking at the front again
trying to fiqure out where to cut and what to try and salvage, when I looked
at the space between the kick panel and the nose panel (what was left) and
found the radio block off plate, looks like when it got removed it was
dropped there and there it has lived for who knows how long!
   The next thing I discovered was a spring loaded metal flap in the heater
tube. This is the pipe going up to the defrosters, just above where the
openings are for the floor heat. It appears that when you move the lever to
turn the tube to close the floor openings the spring moves with it and opens
the flap up to allow the heat to go to the defrosters. So playing with this
a little I discovered that if you open the tube? all the way for floor heat
the flap closes all the way and doesn't allow heat to the defrosters.
