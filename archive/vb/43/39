I have found that the DMV to be an institution where an awful lot of
discretion is left to the moody lady at the desk with the long line of
people waiting to see her. A photo of the bus, a positive attitude,
some dumb story about being conceived in a bus or something can go a
long way towards making the DMV experience easier and cheaper. 12
years could be an awful lot of back registration money if they take a
dislike to you.
That was my 2 cents, now I'm broke,

From my experience and failing memory, you obtain insurance first, and
take the rear plate, bill of sale, and yourself into the DMV, and
tell'em
you bought it, and you need to create a new pink slip, and get it
registered. Take some blank checks too. That oughta do it.
