Whoa, You guys are VERY fortunate.  In Mew Mexico, if
you want a State Police guy to inspect your vehicle,
it takes a MONTH to get an appointment.  Or, if you're
so foolish, one hour of overtime (maybe $60.00 or
more) for an Albuquerque Police officer to do so.

That, plus the $75+ for the bond and the fee from my
local title company makes it really tough to get a
title for early busses!

(Done it on more than one previous occasions!  Ask
hazetguy(-at-)earthlink.net (bus-snob) how long it took me
to do it for him by the MVD {in CA - DMV} rules!
