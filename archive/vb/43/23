Hi list-

I couldn't find the answer to this in the archives, although I know I 
have seen the issue discussed.

I recently purchased a bus that has been sitting for 12 years.  It 
has plates, but the registration sticker is too deteriorated to read. 
I have a hand written bill of sale.

What is the best approach to take with the DMV to get it registered?

TIA
