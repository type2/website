Everyone has a tent, but no one can find poles.......... right?
Well I pose this question to the "list" Is there enough of a demand to ha=
ve these made? I recently have come upon the means to do (make) just abou=
t anything metal and was thinking of making these.

Also FWIW, I'm looking for Bus spindles cores. I've made my own dropped s=
pindles for awhile, but stayed away from doing them for others due to lia=
bilities. I have taken care of that as well, and I'm looking for good cor=
es now.
