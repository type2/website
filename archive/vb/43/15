A coupla things to try;  remove the pulley entirely (get a replacement
FIRST! Removing a pulley will often destroy the cheaper ones unless you
have a really nice puller), and look at the 'nose' of the generator... it
should be FLAT where the shaft exits, but they often get dished out by
bad/worn/crappy pulleys. You will never get it to tighten properly when
like that. Sadly, the generator will need a new end if this is the case.

Also, look at your pulley and examine it for wear; the slots on the old
ones should fit SNUGLY around the mated prongs. Newer ones should fit
tightly around the center post. Neither one should have side to side play
when you grab the rearmost half and move it left or right.

A rattly sound is often bearings - a misadjusted belt can toast em pretty
quick.
I'd get a new/different pulley  with at least 10 shims total (in and out of
pulley halves) and see if you still have the same problems. Don't lose the
little woodruff key that goes in the gen shaft when you pull the pulley :)
