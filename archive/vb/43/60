Subject: Re: [VB] Tell me 'bout this brake hone thing

I got my hone at Sears.  Think they call it a brake cylinder hone. 
Seems like it was less than $20.  It takes some time to do the 
honing, but I found it to be much easier than using the reamer. 
Having said that, when I did it the first time, I over did it a bit, 
and had to get another set of bushings.  Not sure why, but one one 
attempt to fit the pin it wouldn't go in, and on the next it was too 
loose.
