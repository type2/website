Thomas,

The problem may stem from your exhaust.  If you are in cold climates, cold
air leaking in from the exhaust  will cause a backfire.  When the engine is
warmed up the air around the exhaust is not cold.

Recently my bus started backfiring on the morning

an immediate backfire.  Proceeds to run fine and if I

will start right back up with no backfire.  Also get
no backfire when I =
start her up to go home from work at night.

Any ideas?

Thanks
