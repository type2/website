And I add this:

Bought one from NAPA for about $15US when I did my
swing lever shaft.  Works slowly because it's taking
very little metal off at a time.  Biggest problem is
that with the bushings in place, there's a space between
the two bushings on the inside of the hole.  The hone
was just small enough to get caught between the two bushings.
It would get stuck between the two bushings and since it's
on springs to "open" it, the hone would get caught 
so I couldn't pull it out.  Had to pull off the grease
nipple on the front of the housing, push a small
screwdriver through the nipple hole to push each
of the hone stones in enough to get it out.

Took a while (hour maybe) of hone, retract, test fit,
hone, retract, test fit.....until the shaft went in snug.
