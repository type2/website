Wow, you are very forgiving.  How many times did you take it back to them to
rectify the problem??

I think anything more than once is too much.  Obviously its your call.  Just my
opinion, but if I contract for work from someone and I compensate them with
dollars for said completion of contracted work, I expect the result of that
work to have been completed correctly and competently.  Realistically, shit
happens and things will always go wrong, but after multiple attempts to fix the
problem to no avail, I'd expect my money back.
