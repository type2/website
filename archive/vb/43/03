hey justin, i have a 66 dormobile. it's really hard to
determine the value of dormoiles because there's so
few of them and each one is so different. how complete
is it? does it have a westfalia interior or a
dormobile interior? is the interior all there? i would
say that completeness is the biggest factor in value
because of those parts are really hard to find. except
now dormobile has been bought out by a 4x4 company in
europe and they are repro'ing a lot of parts. check
them out at http://www.dormobile.com
hope this helps.
