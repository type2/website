Hi Cal,
Good instructions!  It is 43 lb. ft. or 6.0 mgk.  Do not insert the 
screwdriver in the upper pulley to lock it till one has the nut and thusly 
the upper pulley fairly tight by hand locking it on and off while you wrench 
on it.  This way while one tightens the nut onto the upper pulley it will 
rotate and allow the belt to not get pinched and bend the pulley.  When you 
do insert the screwdriver make sure to keep it in a straight radial line from 
the generator axle or risk bending the edge of the pulley up.  The belt 
should be a bit loose when the engine is cool.  As the engine heats up the 
distance from the center of the lower and upper pulley actually expands as 
the engine and generator stand expand.  This will result in a tighter belt 
when the engine is warm.  Too tight and generator bearings can be 
overstressed till they fail all too soon.   Eric&Barb
