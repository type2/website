Subject: RE: [VB] case studs too short

My washers are 3/32, not 1/4". Sure they are 1/4" thick?

the biggest problem (so far!!) on my new aluminum case is that the
case studs are too short - some nuts (both large and small) do not
torque down all the way to the point that the stud protrudes from the
nut. some are flush; one big nut only goes on about halfway.

this is bad.

i could leave off the case washers, but that sounds like a pretty
stupid idea, so i need to know what else my options might be.  you
can pretty much rule out backing out the studs, as i have been told
they are IN there sumpin fierce. if i had a COMPETENT local machine
shop i might try it, but alas...
i've thought about using a thinner case washer, but i assume vw
provided 1/4" thick ones for a reason!  anyone know what steel
specification these washers are? maybe i can find a stronger grade,
thinner washer............

so much for aip's bullshit about handpicking me a new case.
