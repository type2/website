Subject: Yokohama quote

Looks like I'm gonna go with the Yoko Y356 185R14, load range C (1600lbs/50psi max).  Local tire store quotes me $430 for five tires, mounted and 
balanced.  Tirerack will ship 5 to me for $300, but then it's probably cost me another hundred or so to get them put on.

I'm in my 40s and I've *never* bought a full set of tires nor paid for anything above the cheapest.  This is over half what I paid for the bus.  My 
Scottish genes are a-makin' me quiver.  Hoot, mon.
