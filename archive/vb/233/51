A 60 Standard appeared at Pick n Pull here in Fresno, Calif. What a rust bucket. It must have been sitting
somewhere in the elements for the past 10 years. The rodents lost their home!  The door hinges are so rusty, I
could barely open the doors. Not much usable/left on it. About all I saw worth anything was large logo Sekurit
glass in the front doors. Vent glass was toast. All the sheet metal is rusted thru. The roof is rusting thru
from the inside.
