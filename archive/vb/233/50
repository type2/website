Craig & all other Volk-a-maniacs,

We'll be there with our entourage.  Little girl, wife and wife's
father/mother and his brother/sister.  I'm 6'4", and also use a #2 (but I
pay a hairdresser too much for it.)  We'll be in the '67 standard white on
top, green on the bottom.  Needs interior, but runs well... had it up to
72MPH the other day.  Scary.  My wife's uncle has a '67 bug that is recently
totally restored.  Very sharp.

See you at the swap.
Greg (& father-in-law Dan)
