Subject: RE: [VB] sapphire radio question

As with all push button radios, except the GM ones, there is usually a little
latch on the push button that snaps into the flat shaft that protrudes from
the preset tuner core assembly. I had to take the two halves of the case off,
unscrew the tuner assembly from the front plate to do some work on my radio,
but you should only need to slide the front decorative plate off to see the
button latches, it's all visible from the outside.

Hi John,
We know there is a trick to doing that, but have not figured it out yet!
