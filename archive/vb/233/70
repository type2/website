Subject: Volkswagen rotisserie pictures

A couple T2 & VB list members had requested pics of our rotisserie when
completed, so here they are.

This bus is a '59 Kombi "sub-fakia". Somebody over the years had an inkling for
standing room!

This rotisserie was designed and built from scratch by Travis Doll (mechanical
engineer and current owner of this '59) in my garage over the winter of 2003.
This bus currently has no more removable items on it, ready for sand-blasting,
welding, painting and re-install of everything.

If you would like detailed pictures, please ask too.
