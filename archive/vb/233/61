When I rebuilt the engine for my '59 Kombi, I also rebuilt the carb....a 
few times actually. After I got tired of messing with it I bought a new one 
from Ronnie. Some of the best money I ever spent. Engine ran like a 
"singer" after adding that carb. Any engine I rebuild from now on will get 
a new carb. Just makes sense.
