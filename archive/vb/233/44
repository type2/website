Subject: RE: [VB] case studs too short

I'm sure that's the problem, the studs are set too deep. That doesn't solve
anything, it just means that the face of the block at each hole has to be
refaced. I bet it's that way on the majority of them, but nobody has really
complained about having no threads exposed above the nuts.

I'll bet that the problem is one of the stud holes are too deep, not the
studs being too short.
