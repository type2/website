Subject: stud success

ok, i put some kroil on the offending studs last night, let em sit... 
tapped the studs gently with a hammer this morn and put on double 
nuts.  most came out with out too much of a struggle, and i backed em 
off 2 threads. looked  like some had red loctitie on them; i haven't 
decided if i want to PULL them all, clean and reloctite.

not sure if they've changed processes, but i will say that these 
pulled a lot easier than the ones on the previous case (which would 
NOT budge).  i'm not sure if i should be ascairt o' that :)
