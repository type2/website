I saw David Mayes is going to be up in Puyallup. I am hoping to be there
as well. Hopefully with a swap space. I will be driving a white 91 Audi
200 Turbo Quattro. I know it doesn't count as vintage or bus, but I need
to get it gone and my Thing sold before I can figure out if I have
enough dough left to start into finding and building my double door
panel walk thru dream. Anyway come up and say high. I am 6'2", almost
always in shorts, usually baseball cap, buzzed hair (#2 for you home
head shavers) and will most likely have two little girls running around
in the swap area.

hope to see you there,
Craig
the Gorge
