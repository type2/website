I didna ken tha' "woo hoo" was Scots.  Okay, enough stereotyping, even if it's my own ethnic heritage.  I just got off the phone with the FLATS and 
they're ordering me 4 dear Yoko Y356s, load range C (1600lbs).  $343.04 for everything including high-speed balancing.

BTW for folks in the Tallahassee or Jacksonville area, I've had good experience with this local chain - Sun Tire - over the past couple of years.  Up 
till now it's been a tire at a time as needed, but they've always done me right and they're gentle with my antique rides.  They didn't try to talk me into 
buying something in stock.  Almost always fast service.  Not affiliated with them other than throwing my money at them.

Tires should be on the bus by early next week.  I also ordered a set of KYB gas-a-justs.

Eating ramen noodles until next payday,
Joe
