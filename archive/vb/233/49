thanks again E&B. This is the information that I needed. It was
strange that the owners manual mentioned how much you needed in the
RGB and to change it every tranny change, but it didn't indicate that
after a fill you can just check the tranny. Made sence, but I wanted
to make sure I wasn't just inventing maintenance advice in my head :)
