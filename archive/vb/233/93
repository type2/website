Subject: Heat riser repair

On the 1600 DP engine in the 66 the heat riser has a hole in it, right
at the bend. I have tried many different "high heat" exhaust repairs,
but as of yet, nothing has worked for more than 3 days. Has anyone
else been able to repair this piece? I found plenty of articles in the
archives about cleaning out a blocked tube, but didn't stumble across
any repair questions.
