Subject: OT Indonesian Scams on eBay

Maine Antique Digest has a long article about Indonesian Scams on eBay. Are
the Indonesians trying to match the Nigerians in cleverness?

"...The scam--and it is a scam--runs like this. Someone, usually in
Indonesia, copies a photo used by a genuine eBay seller, or a dealer with a
Web site, then registers as an eBay seller. The new seller posts his
merchandise for auction on eBay, usually the same day he registers, and
runs the copied photo with the lot. If there's any description, it is
usually copied from the original seller's description..."
