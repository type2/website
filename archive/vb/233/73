I pay way too much attention to cars on the freeway.  If anyone ever wanted 
to know or even cared what "number" his or her license plate was, now you 
can figure it out.  I even have the math worked out for trucks.

Now, this works for Cali cars between 1956 and now, trucks that use the 
A12345, 65498D, or 7A56987 style of plate, or any state that uses plates 
like these.

Check it out.  Then scratch your head.  Then call me crazy.  Then go back 
to your daily life.  :)
