Subject: heading to florida

I am gearing up for the trip to St pete Florida for
the VWs over the skyway gig. Today i changed out the
gas tank to a 15 gal tank. Pretty strait forward.
Unfortunately i got an even better look at my floor
and it seems I lose more metal every day. I think I
may weld in some braces from the bed to frame when I
get back ,At least I will feel better about using the
truck for work untill I can get it up to Kelly for
some reconstruction.No more Heavy loads
Thursday I will change my oil and top off the tranny
and redux boxes. Unfortunately I didnt finish spray
bombing it one color or finish the bumpers. i will
head out early Friday morning , my first long trip in
my truck, and hopefully arrive unscathed at a
reasonable time that night.

Later-
