I'm not sure about this one.  I do think there is somewhat of an
availability problem with some turn signal switches.

There has been some success reported with using contact or tuner cleaner
on balky turn signal switches.  *Don't* use WD-40 or similar oils and
solvents!  Get the right stuff from Radio Shack or a clueful hi-fi store.
Squirt it in along the stalk, towards the contacts, and work the switch
back and forth a few times to clean the contacts.  Let the cleaner
evaporate and check how well the switch works.

Go to http://www.type2.com/library/electris/vw-9prong.html and do what's
in the "Troubleshooting" section.  It should tell you where the problem
is.  Often it's something cheap to fix, like a bad ground or loose wire
at the rear tail lights.
