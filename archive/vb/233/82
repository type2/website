Your guess is probably correct. My case is 4141 and the case that was in the
shop, 4715, definitely needed to be faced or have the studs removed and
reinstalled like you did. Personally, I like my studs bottomed in the hole so
that there is no chance of the stud moving backward and forward when heated
and cooled and vibrated.

i looked into that, but i had 4 studs (big and little) that were too
far inset to get by with it. i have a feeling EVERY case is different!
