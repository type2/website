Craig et all,
I just posted some pics a few minutes ago on my case nut research this
morning. To boil it all down into a couple of sentences, I found that if you
dump the massively thick washers that come with the case and use some factory
washers, you can probably achieve the desired results. check my pics.

ok, i put some kroil on the offending studs last night, let em sit...
tapped the studs gently with a hammer this morn and put on double
nuts.  most came out with out too much of a struggle, and i backed em
off 2 threads. looked  like some had red loctitie on them; i haven't
decided if i want to PULL them all, clean and reloctite.

not sure if they've changed processes, but i will say that these
pulled a lot easier than the ones on the previous case (which would
NOT budge).  i'm not sure if i should be ascairt o' that :)
