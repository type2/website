Subject: RE: [VB] Vintage VW insurance/again

Amfam beat everyone else on the *package* deal... including the house
coverage... then again, a friend runs the agency.

  I checked with American family and their primary vehicle rates are
almost
triple what I allready pay to Farmers for full coverage on my domestic
vehicles which also need to be insured by American Family to get the
vintage
coverage.
  All Pullman's requires is that all none vintage vehicles and drivers
in
the household are insured.  People just need to shop to get the best
deal.
  I'm sure that if I switched all of my insurance over to American I
would
get a better rate, but that would be a major PITA
