The gear oil in the RGBs and center section are connected.  They mix.

try this.... next time you change your gear oil, leave the center section 
drain plugs out, and fill a RGBox.   Watch as the gear oil starts pouring out 
of the center section.  It flowed to the middle through the tube from the 
RGBox.  It's like a habitrail.
