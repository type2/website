Subject: Re: [VB] case studs too short

Hi Craig,
Looks to us like the case needs to be counter bored a tad bit deeper.  Try 
running a flat edge across the studs to see if they are the same hieght or 
measure them for equal length with engine case halfs apart.  If not even in 
length then we would suspect that some studs are set in to deep.
