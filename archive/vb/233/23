Subject: Bignut vs bay tires -- any diff?

Reading the archives to narrow down my tire search for my 65 fakewestia, and one thing that confuses me is whether people are talking bay tires or 
splits - if there's any serious difference??  Is there?

Right now I've narrowed it to either the Bridgestone RD603V or the Yoko Y356 (if I can't find 370's) in a 185R14 load range C or D.

I read one post in the archives that suggested maybe 185 wasn't best for a bignut splitty -- but seems like everything else I read points to this as a 
preferable size over the 195/75.

To avoid a tiresome tire thread, feel free to pmail me if you think I'm going wrong with the 185s.

Thanks,
Joe Clark
