If you have a VW made since the early 70s, it probably has a sticker
somewhere near the gas filler that says what octane number it requires.
Trouble is that there's at least three octane numbers associated with any
particular kind of gas.  There are the Research and Motor octane numbers,
which are determined on a test engine under slightly different conditions.
Research is always higher than Motor.  The third one is the average of
the Research and Motor numbers.

In the US, the automakers specify the average number and that's how gas
is labeled at the station -- see the "(R+M)/2" on some of the octane
stickers on the pumps.  In Germany, they specify and sell by the Research
number.  The sticker on late VWs will say something like "Oktan min. 91
ROZ" or "91 RON", which refers to the Research number.

The $4-a-gallon question is: how do you translate?  If your VW says 91
Research, gas rated 91 R and 83 M and sold as 87 (R+M)/2 will meet the
spec, but gas rated 88 R and 86 M and sold as 87 (R+M)/2 won't.  But
there doesn't seem to be a hard rule.  I can't easily find separate
R and M numbers from a couple of big oil companies, but the race gas
people will give you numbers all day, though.  Here's a sampling:

 R      M      (R+M)/2 *   Spread/2
100.8   88.6   95         6.1
104     96    100         4
105     95    100         5
107     99    103         4
109     99    104         5
107.9   96.6  102         5.7
115    105    110         5
                          5.0 average
* to nearest whole number

So, if this data is still reasonably applicable to normal fuels, gas
rated 87 (R+M)/2 is probably rated something like 92 R and 82 M, making
it fine for a car that calls for 91 M.

For far more than you ever wanted to know about octane, the American
Petroleum Institute (oil company trade/technical association) has an
interesting report from 1994 at http://www.api.org/pasp/rs083.pdf .  One
of the many interesting bits from that report is that "Octane numbers at
the end of 1968 averaged 90.4 for leaded regular and 96.2 for leaded
premium."
