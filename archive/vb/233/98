Speaking of slats, if anyone is replacing original ones with nice new
replacements and you'd like to get rid of your old ones, my DC needs a
set.  I'm looking for complete or partial sets of original bed slats for
a double cab.  While I won't be searching for original bed slat screws,
I would like the look of original weathered slats to match the truck.

Awhile back someone back east offered up a partial set, but I lost their address.

Thanks.
