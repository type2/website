  The EMPI roof racks are great for the price, I now sell them for 249.95
down 25 dollars from last year as the price to me has gone down. PIP makes a
great rack also for 499.99.

Ive only seen originals.
Does anyone have one of the Empi repros?
Opinion?
Who has the best deal on Empi stuff?
Does one of our discount offering vendor/listees do Empi?

I think they are much more attractive than the VW style tube racks
and its cheaper to boot. I assume it wont be quite as hearty.
