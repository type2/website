Now that Randy's has stopped selling them directly, Wolfsburg West
carries his repro set in oak (or at least we've heard its his) for
$175--search their website for "WOOD SLAT SET SINGLE CAB".  I don't
think that includes mounting hardware and of course you will have to
varnish yourself.  You can also find another outfit selling sets on eB*y
with hardware from time to time but at a much higher cost.  I've never
heard of anyone making a set from teak.  A few years back there was some
discussion about what OG wood might have been used, I believe there were
some guesses that German oak was most likely.
