Subject: dilemma over (for the moment)

Hi All,

 

Thanks to a few for words of wisdom regarding my AR behavior for the
requirement of setting a date for the double cab.  I just got off the
phone and have purchased an NOS german case that was purchased from a
dealer in '72.  The case comes with a set of nos empi 88 slipper skirts
but that's the boring part of the story.  This will really allow me to
set the date to 1973 which is ultimately set by the original set of Race
Shop heads.

 

So, hopefully next week I'll be able to start piecing together my
vintage 2 liter motor for my vintage bus. I'm all smiles.  It couldn't
be better with several types of legal/illegal chemical compounds. :-)

 

 

Thanks again for putting up with me.

 

 

Hey, to all you PNWers. See you in Puyallup on Sunday!!!

David
