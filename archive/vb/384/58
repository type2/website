Subject: Herbie Fully Loaded VW Bus Rdio Controlled

While perusing my local Grocery Outlet I happened to almost
trip over a Herbie Fully Loaded 1/6 scale VW bus radio controlled
toy. Same as the one offered in the ebay ad here:
<http://cgi.ebay.com/Herbie-Fully-Loaded-VW-Lime-and-White-Bus-RC-1-6-NIB_W0QQitemZ6056921362QQcategoryZ1200QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem>

Grocery Outlet was selling them for $60.

If anyone is interested, check out your local Grocery Outlet.

I can't figure out where to put such a large RC vehicle, so I didn't get it.
