I had a problem like that once and it turned out to be a bit of sand 
inside the voltage regulator keeping the little relay from closing 
all the way.  Actually I just replaced the voltage regulator with 
another but went ahead and looked inside the original "bad" one and 
found this.  Not sure how the grit got in there but a bit of cleaning 
and it was good as new.

Anyhow, Speedy Jim has a good generator troubleshooting page:
