Subject: Re: [VB] generator problem

Hey Dave  These are easy to test just need a  dc  volt meter  . Take the two 
leads off the gen. hook the hot lead to D+ and ground lead to  Df  start the 
engine take a short jumper wire from Df  and touch it to  the body of the 
generator as you rev the engine. the voltage should jump to 18  volts . do not 
leave the jumper touching too long.  To check the  voltage reg take the main hot 
wires off of B+ terminal and hook your hot lead to  it and ground to the 
battery ground  start the engine and rev it should  read around 13.5 V   that's it  
later  mark  dearing
