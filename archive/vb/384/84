Subject: clear or yellow needle

Hi all,
what is the correct speedometer needle for a 56 bus. I presume that it is a clear needle and that the needle is similar to the one that is on bug. My question is more about the yellow needle, is it a clear one that as change of color due to sun exposition or it is a completely different one. 
Any trick to take a needle from a speedometer without breaking it? We have the right speedo but without needle, we may try to find a use speedo and take the needle out but I do not want to break the needle. I know that there is repro needle but I am not sure about the quality.
Comments?
Regards
Claude
