Hi Chuck,
Buy the one gallon gear oil bottle with the accessory hand pump from  
Sta-Lube and make sure it is GL-4 not GL-5 rated.  Fill the RGB and then  top off the 
tranny.  You do this because once you drain the RGB, you drain  a portion 
(about 1/4) of the tranny center section, and the gear oil  that fills the axle 
tube.  Otherwise you risk damaging the tranny center  section gears and 
bearings due to low gear oil.
