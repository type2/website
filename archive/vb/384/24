Hi Matthew,
Are you referring to the driver seat pivot screws?  All of  the screws in the 
driver seat we can think of are VW only, and not ones you will  exactly find 
at your local hardware store.  In a pinch one could use  bolts with washers 
for the pivot screws, and just bolts for the adjusting  screws.  Just take the 
seat parts to your local hardware store and find the  metric thread size bolts 
there.
   Good to hear you have found the bus parts manuals  (-at-)

Having the correct part name, and part number you can much easily do  
searches on many VW parts suppliers websites (like Wolfburg West),  and advertise on 
many websites (like Thesamba.com) for  parts.  
  As for the passenger seat (assuming you have a non-walk thru) it  flips up 
at the rear and has a pair of hooks to hold/hinge the front edge.
