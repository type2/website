Subject: Wed morning Berg Cruise update ...

Hi all,

I just got off the phone with them and the Berg Cruise just left 
Junction City, Kansas for St. Louis tonight.  Evey VW is running strong, 
with the only problem being a "hot-start" issue in someone's car (big 
deal!) They are cruising at about 63-65 mph on average. 

They said they love to meet any local VW folks, so drive on over to the 
Best Western Collinsville Inn in Collinsville, Il after about 6pm 
tonight to see/meet these VW long-distance Tour freaks!  I'm joining 
onto the Tour to Michigan Thursday morning in my '55 Oval.
