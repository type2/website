Subject: Re: [VB] FW: inside cargo door handles....

All the inside cargo door handles for the splitties are interchangable.   But the 60 & earlier ones are a neat curved smooth shape made in metal.   The earlier ones for a panel they were a dull grey, but chrome for the passenger models.

Hey  I'm looking for two door handles for the inside of our cargo 1958 DD
doors. Do all the handles fit universal or are they specific to
years??? . Merri
