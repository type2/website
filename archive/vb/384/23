haven't had a problem getting the fill plugs out, but if I did, I could  just 
roll the bug over and fill from the drain holes,  right?


hey Clara  I guess you could :)   I saw a guy who couldn't  get his fill 
plugs out after he had already drained the tranny.  He did get  the redux fill 
plug out and had to fill the whole thing thur the redux box by  rising that side 
way high. Took a long time.  Later  mark D
