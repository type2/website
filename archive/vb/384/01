Subject: The LAST Annual VW Buses n Boats Campout in Ohio May 19-21

Howdy Y'all,
With my new job and the impending re-location
distracting all my energy, I have been totally remiss
in pimping the LAST (Sixth) Annual VW Buses 'n Boats
Bash Campout in Morrow Ohio (32 miles north of
Cincinnati) on May 19-21, 2006.
The campout is sponsored by the Ohio Valley Tribe of
the Full Moon Bus Club and features Canoeing,
River-side camping, Music, Breakfast burritos,
Cincinnati-style chili Dinner, kids activities, door
prizes and MORE!!
Everybody come and bring a breakfast burrito
ingredient.  Saturday evening will be the
CIncinnati-style (think "Skyline" or Goldstar") chili
dinner. I'll provide the chili, so you can bring a
side thing to go with it (like spaghetti noodles, hot
dogs, buns, cheese, etc.)
Camping is $10 per night per person, canoeing is
optional and will be $12 per adult paddler (include
shuttle and all equipment rental).
As stated this will be THE LAST BUSES N BOATS EVER!!!
Because Memorial Day weekend I am moveing to Cuyahoga
Falls Ohio for my new job, SO DON'T MISS BAKER'S BIG
GOING AWAY CAMPOUT!!!!!
