There is a great hardware store near me that has tons of metric stuff.
I have been going there with lists of bolts since my bus came fully
dis-assembled and missing plenty of parts.
I have not been able to determine, by the parts list, what size those
pivot screws are.

My bus is a walkthrough, I realized I should have mentioned this, but
I think that question has been answered. In either case, I should have
both seats recovered and at the very least I will be attempting to
install them by the weekend.

I am almost done welding back in the sheetmetal that was removed from
her and I am so stoked to get to tool around in her.

Thanks all for the help, I will update on where I end up and ask if I
need more help.
