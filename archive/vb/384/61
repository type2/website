Subject: Arch of a roof

Does anyone know if the arch or profile of a the roof of a bus is the same 
throughout the years? That is, will a Dormoble top or small westy pop-top or 
Devon poptop fit the same on an early 60's bus, and early 70's bus and a 
late 70's bus? I suspect that the will however I have two early 70's tops 
(Dorper) that slightly different and I'm a wunderin'.
