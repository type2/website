Subject: Re: [VB] RGB's

 I drain both RGBs and the center first, put the drain plugs back in.
There I pump into the RGBs until it seems full, and the level goes down slowly from the fill hole. repeat otehr side, last center section (once it's on 4 wheels on the ground.   I never measured.

I do believe that Clymers is correct. I use .5 pints and let the rest dribble in from the tranee. Just check the tranee level in a couple of days and top it off.
