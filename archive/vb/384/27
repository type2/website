I spoke with a couple of the guys from Rancho Performance last year and they 
said it does not matter which gear oil is installed in the tranee's.  In 
fact they recommend an oil with a moly additive and most likely it is a GL5. 
Not sure what brand oil that is.

I was lucky enough to find 6 quarts of GL4 sitting on a shelf a while back. 
Still have 2 quarts left. I also put in 3M Molykote. Seems to run a little 
quieter.

Anyone know any different?
