Subject: VW Buses n Boats Event UPDATES-Ohio May 19-21

HOLY CR(-at-)P!!  With all the distracting trivialites of
life (like starting a new job and uprooting my family
to a new city), I haven't been actively promoting the
LAST Annual VW Buses n Boats Campout next weekend, May
19-21 in Morrow, Ohio (32 miles north of Cincinnati).
http://www.geocities.com/buses_n_boats 
 Heres the update:

*Camping is $10 per adult per night (children under 16
years free w\ parents) You will register for camping
at the CAMPSITE and pay ME for camping fees, do not
register and pay at the Canoe rental office!!

*The Canoe trip will happen at 10:30 am Saturday
morning and is OPTIONAL (meet at the picnic shelter at
10:15 am!!). Fees for canoe trip will be $12 per
paddler (includes all equipment rental and
transportation, and yes, I'll make sure they put gas
in the bus before they transport us!!) You will pay
CANOE fees at the canoe rental office.

*Sorry, but due to the previously mentioned
"distractions" I was unable to do T-shirts this year,
BUT Tom Daugherty has once again been kind enough to
manufacture the Official Buses n Boats Commemerative
pin-back Buttons, which everyone who registers will
receive for free.  Sure to be a collectors item!

*There will be a 50\50 split the pot Raffle drawing
with half of the $profits$ going to the drawing winner
and the other half going to the "firewood fund"

*The Cincinnati-style Chili dinner will happen Satuday
evening at 6:30 pm at the shelter. I will provide the
chili, you all should bring something to go with it.
Suggestions: Spaghetti Pasta, Hot Dogs, Buns, Cheese,
etc.

*Of course, we'll do breakfast burritos on Saturday
morning, we just need someone to take charge (Hey
Frank!!)

*DOOR PRIZES- We will be doing door prizes drawing at
dinner Saturday, so if you can bring some trinkets for
door prizes, LET ME KNOW!!

*Again remember that this is going to be the FINAL (as
in LAST, Finito, NO MO') VW Buses n Boats Event ever,
because of my move, so LET'S DO IT UP RIGHT!!! 
EVERYBODY MUST COME AND GIVE ME A PROPER FAREWELL, I
WILL ACCEPT NO EXCUSES FOR NO-SHOWS!!!
