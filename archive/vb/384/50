Chris-
   
  If your looking at using tools i'd at least get a 30 gallon tank. I bought my craftsman set up at sears 30gal tank 6hp for around $300. A 10 gallon tank will need to be run all the time just to keep up with using tools.

  Hi,

I need a new compressor to work on my bus. I'm not doing any painting, just 
using power tools and blowing things off. How are the Harbor Freight units? 
I am looking at their part number:
90234-3VGA
Central Pneumatic

Its called out as 4HP 10 gallon tank. Mostly I am interested in 
durability. Will it last if I use it on weekends for an hour or two? Or is 
it a use it for a year and then dump it item?

And yes I know, you get what you pay for.


Any recommendations or comments?

Thanks!!
Chris
