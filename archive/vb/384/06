Subject: Howdy folks...once again.

Subject says it all.....I just can't seem to keep away after 7 or so years of this list..even after a year being busless.
   
  Hope all is well with everyone, and I hope the samba hasn't taken everyone away from here.  Looking forward to seeing a bunch of y'all at the shows...after I get my ass back in a bus.
   
  On that note, anyone got any good bus for sale leads?
