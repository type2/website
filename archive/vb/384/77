Subject: Wheel bearing crossover

I was driving my 65 home tonight, two blocks from home I started
hearing this terrible grinding noise coming from underneath me. I
think my bearings are shot or were dry or something.

I have front wheel bearings from when I owned a 63, would they work on
my 65 or would I need to purchase new?

Thanks
-Matthew
