I buy it by the gallon at NAPA. Just need to give the counter drone the part

 but a non GL-5 oil is not to be found from any vendor, even after
letting them know that the crc products they carried also made sta-lube,
they were told its not made anymore! I think I'll have to make due with
whats available and grab some straight 90wt next time I'm in Port Angeles.
