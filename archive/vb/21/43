Write back in 30 years and let us know how it works out.  :)

Are the coils wired with the same (or d(-at-)mn close) gauge of magnet
wire and the same (or d(-at-)mn close) number of turns?  If not, there
probably were some design differences.

From what I understand, good used semaphores can go for $100 a pop.
The resistor will cost you $15 tops.  "Pay me now or pay me later..."  :)
