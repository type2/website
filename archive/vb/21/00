Subject: Re: [VB] semaphores

I run my 6v Semaphores with 12v bulbs, and run the semaphores them selves on
12v.  I have been doing this for almost a year with no problems.  I have a
set of SWF (non VW) 12v semaphores, and the coils are identical size, so I
don't think the actuation is a problem, it's just the melting of the lenses
with 6v bulbs running on 12v.
