Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome as scheduled

I have been sitting here all day watching the news wondering too about the
Jerome meet and affects of today's incidents.

I would like to suggest a way to help this tragedy we have all been watching
unfold in front of us today.  Last year I am aware that the chosen charity
was unable to take full advantage of the donations collected at the Jerome
Jamboree.  In the event of this again this year I thought that the overage
could be donated to the cause at hand.  This would bring such a positive
light to an event so close to this tragedy.

My 1.5 cents
