FWIW last year I installed my repro set of wood bedslats using #12
half-inch panhead screws from underneath.  The screw is a perfect size
and shape for the factory-drilled holes in the bed.  This leaves an
unbroken surface on top when viewing the result.  I carefully predrilled
screw holes in the underside of each slat using a drill stop.  Also used
snippets of bicycle innertube for sealing gaskets.  I know it's not
stock, but I think the unbroken look is nice, leaves no screwhead or
rivet hole edges for snags, and leaves the wood slats less susceptible
to breaking.
