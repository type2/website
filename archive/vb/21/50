 I have developed an annoying leak in one of my pushrod tubes.
 Does anyone have a repair for this short of pulling the engine and replacing
 the seals?
 The engine is running great and there's only a couple of months left in the
 camping season, I'd really like to avoid breaking everything down just now.
 TIA

you can get those two part push rod tubes.  Pull the rocker, remove the push 
rod from the offending tube, twist the tube out with apair of pliers, inset 
new tube with new seals, assemble.    do check the valves a couple hundred 
miles later.
BTDT, keep a spare two part tube in my emergency kit in the bus
