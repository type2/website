Jim,
Matt Roberds has written an EXCELLENT procedure for trouble shooting\fixing lights taht is found in the type2.com library. I had the same situation on my 66, converted to 12 V but some pieces were still 6 V (Including 9 prong box flasher).  Anyway, find this article and follow the instructions. Easy to follow and works like a charm!  And you don't need a voltage drop, just cheapo 12 volt flashers... and well, read the article :-)
