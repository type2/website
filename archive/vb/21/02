I seem to remember that story vaguely.
It has been on this bus since 93 at least- that the right time frame?

other question- this 67 camper (with the pseudo W carb)  has a camper kit 
with red vinyl red piping covering the camper cushions, the long window on 
the drivers side- with a movable piece in front and back, center pane fixed.  
twwod (mahogany?) with brassey handles/hinges.  table top ugly yellowy 
squiggly patterned formica.   Had a cooler unit which PO left somewhere, same 
set up as a westy so 42 pretty much.  Is that the Sundial?  Riviera?  I never 
can keep it straight.  to pull the bed out you pull straight back.  you can 
not flip the bottom of the seat up to get at stuff stored in there- you have 
to open the cabinet door, meaning you cant leave stuff in the way.  Know what 
I mean?  I can't get to the samba gallery right now to look at pics-  ya I 
just bought this thing god know why, from a lady who says she bought it from 
the OO.  But she is somewhat vague on details, bus sat since 94, it has been 
a while.
