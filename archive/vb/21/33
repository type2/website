Subject: RE: [VB] US camper kit /Weber carb ???s

Sounds like the Riviera window alright.....I have seen a couple of original Sundials with the red vinyl interior, and an EZ with the red vinyl.  The brass pulls and hinges sounds like the ones in my EZ and some Sundials.  The bed setup sounds just like my EZ bed and a Sundial bed I had.  They were identical. 
 Take a look on the bottom cushion on the z-bed. My z-bed in the EZ has an old yellowed piece of paper stapled to the bottom.  Beleive it says EZ Camper, and a patent number.  It's about the size of business card.


Hope that helps,  and see y'all in Jerome...leaving Weds mornin'.
