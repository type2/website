  Nice charity, for the kids, I'll have to buy even more raffle tickets this
year.

Sorry, but yes, you must be present to purchase raffle tickets and win the 
bus.  We have labored over the possibilities of selling tickets in advance, 
through the mail, and so on, and the related problems are just more than we 
feel we can deal with (at this time).  It would be great for the club
because 
I am sure we could raise a whole bunch more money that way, but until
someone 
comes up with a fool-proof way of doing it, this is how it remains.

By the way, for those who do not know, even though Jerome Jamboree is the 
primary money-making event for the ABC to exist on during the year, we do 
manage to donate a substantial amount to charity.  Last year's event allowed

us to split $6,000 between two local AZ charities.  This year's charities
are 
the Animal Benefits Club (another ABC) which is a no-kill shelter, and 
Hacienda de Los Angeles, which is a home that cares for permanently damaged 
young victims of near-drownings (a major problem in the Phoenix area).

Hope to see as many of you at Jerome as possible,

Jon Stanton
VP, Arizona Bus Club
