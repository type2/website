Kevin,

This is a pretty common ailment. What happens is that the collar is
supposed to be "keyed" or "splined". That ridge gets worn down and then
there's nothing to keep it from spinning freely in it's home in the door.
You probably need a new one. I'd try to hunt down a German one if you can.
That, or buy a handful of the repro ones cause they'll wear down pretty quick.

If you can't tell, I am VERY familiar with this issue!

Scott
