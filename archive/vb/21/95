Subject: Jerome Jamboree XI and gas prices

I have been receiving questions regarding Gas Prices in AridZona-- I cannot
speak for Prescott and the Jerome area--But as I was doing errands today in
Phoenix--I saw no signs of price gouging at the gas stations.

The Caravan will be meeting at 6:30AM at I-17 and Thunderbird Road--Home
Depot Parking lot as planned Saturday morning--departure time 7AM-
Drive safely, bless all of you and thanks--, uj
