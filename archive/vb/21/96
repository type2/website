Subject: undercover cops at jerome

hey people,

i've not been able to read the list very frequently the last couple of weeks.  service through this provider was up and down.  i've read all the posts that had jerome in the subject and saw no discussion about the undercover cops that are supposed to be patrolling the gold king mine looking for illegal drugs and underage drinkers.  is this rumor true or just scare mongering?  of course if it is true i'm not scared because my preferred drugs are legal, i'm old enough and i'm a happy drunk... i'm only asking for my friends....
