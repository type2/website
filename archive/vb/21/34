Alas, you and I think alike (logic, what's that). Unfortunately with this
bus, I've already run head on into the "same color wire" thing, courtesy of
the previous owner of my bus. Talk about grief, not only did this guy use
the same color wire on everything, he then spray-painted the interior of the
bus, sans panels -- painting even the still properly color-coded wires in
the bus all grey. Every wire anywhere is painted grey. I like grey as much
as the next guy, but I like electrical color coding... even... more.

So, to find out what wire you have (and you're not usually in a good mood
when you're looking), you have to scratch off the top like some twisted
McDonald's promotion just to see if the wire is the color it says it should
be in the wiring diagram, or if the prize is gonna be this stupid green
stuff he seemed to use for everything.

Actually, of course I realize I have to rewire the whole thing eventually. I
wanted to address the turn signal thing first, however, as it just came up
as a crisis (I HATE driving without being able to signal), and replacing the
whole central nervous system of this bus financially isn't going to be a
happening thing till next Spring

But thank you for the VERY precise help for this one area. I shall be
commencing said investigation this weekend. Your information was superb and
on the quality alone very reassuring.

Craig.
