Hey All,
In the 64 Campmobile I just picked up, I have found a couple of items that may interest someone out there.  One is an original blue-print style instruction sheet for the drive away tents that came with this model, all written in German and very cool.  The size is approximately 8"x10"  The other is the tri-fold brochure type instructions for the tents (there are instructions for a small and a large tent) with instructions written in both german and english.  I do not have the tents for the bus, so I thought someone who had the complete set-up and a show bus may want these things to complete their collection.  I have no idea what these would be worth, if anything, to anyone so i am just going to say that I will trade them for parts.  I have a 66 EZ-Camper?, 64 Campmobile, and an 83 Westy.  If you have any parts for these and want to trade for the tent literature, let me know.  I can send pix.



Peace, John Baker
