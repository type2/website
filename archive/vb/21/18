Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome Raffle Bus????? What day give Raffle.

Hi all,

This is my first Jerome, and so I don't really know the itenerary as to when
events take place and what not.  I've got the flyers, and have been to the
site, but still wonder what the better day to show up is.  I'm assuming the the
Raffle for the bus will be on Sunday.  I'll be in Phoenix for on Thursday, and
heading up to Jerome on Saturday morning early.  So can somebody tell me which
is the better day, as my fam want to come up too, but probably won't want to
hang out for both days, but I'd like to come back up on Sunday.

Thanks in advance,
Aaron
