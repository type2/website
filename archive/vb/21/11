I used an enamel paint that is made for sink's and appliances when I
restored my steering wheel for my beetle.  I've only ever found it in white
though.  It worked awesome!

Hi List,
Does anyone know what kind of paint to use when restoring a steering wheel
and also is there a certain primer that is better to use than others??

Thanks,
