I think that Kyle raises a very good point.  We have already made 
contact/commitments with the charities that were selected/voted on some 9 
months ago.  To go back on our word now would be less than ethical, not to 
mention less than effective.  When I even mentioned the options, I was only 
saying that they would be discussed.  I seriously doubt we will even vote on 
a change, let alone change from the original plan.  However responsible 
comments and suggestions will be considered.  Sarcastic comments and 
suggestions will be ignored.
