Subject: Leaking Push Rod Tube

I have developed an annoying leak in one of my pushrod tubes.
Does anyone have a repair for this short of pulling the engine and replacing
the seals?
The engine is running great and there's only a couple of months left in the
camping season, I'd really like to avoid breaking everything down just now.
TIA
John Flowers
