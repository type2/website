Subject: See what happens when you let your valve adjustments and oil changes go

ummmmm I wouldn't know anything about that..... Just that next time or 
rather there won't be next time.  I dropped the valve drove on it for 
another 2.5 miles and destroyed that piston the case and the cam.  I have 
some other pics if you want to see them.  Got the rebuild in today and it 
runs great.  Thanks goes out to Mike Windle in Fresno for helping me out.
