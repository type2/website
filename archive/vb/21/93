Subject: Delta alert

  My brother in law is in the Air Force stationed in Italy, he's the boss
man for his F 16 squadron ground crew. With in minutes of the WTC tragedy
he was called in to work under a Delta Alert, this is the next stage before
WAR. 
  His wife has not heard from him since the Delta Alert. All of the base,
schools, hospitals, etc. are in LOCK-Down.
   During the GULF WAR his squadron was flying 24 hours a day,. The planes
would only land for refueling, new weapons and a fresh pilot. I'm sure the
situation is the same now. We don't have to worry, we are in very capable
hands with our servicemen overseas and they are READY. GOD bless them.

Ronnie
