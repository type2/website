Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome Raffle Bus????? What day give Raffle.

Hi!  Yes, the bus gets raffled away on Sunday around 1-1:30 or so.  If you 
are coming up on Saturday morning, you might want to join the caravan, 
especially if you are in a VW.  Any raffle tickest you purchase on Saturday 
(after the caravan arrives ONLY) will be good on Sunday and for the bus.  The 
caravan leaves at 7:00 AM, Saturday from the Home Depot parking lot at I-17 
and Thunderbird Rd. in North Phoenix.

Hope to see you there,

Jon Stanton
VP ABC
