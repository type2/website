   What happens is the larger intake valve has air besides the cam moving
the valve. The valve float is created by the suction of the piston pulling
the valve down to far, actually hitting the top of the guide and hammering
it out (at higher rpm's). The duel springs will keep this from happening.
This is what I was informed of by the machine shop. The owner of the machine
shop learned about VW engines by building racing engines for AUTOCRAFT for
15 years, so I listen to what he says, weather right or wrong. I don't like
rev limiters as they cut the spark off and cause misfiring. I will be more
careful and look at my tach when revving high and try to keep it under 6500.

How will the new guides be better equipped to handle the higher revs?
I can understand changing the springs -  I recently learned a *VERY*
painful lesson in valve float - an will henceforce keep my engine
rev limited to ~6500.

Are there any lighter valves available?

Sounds like you need a rev limiting rotor, too.
