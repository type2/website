Buy a front wheel bearing seal kit (#211-498-061) from Bus Boys in
Calif. and it comes with this rubber replacement seal.  (Also one thrust
washer and one lock washer.)

Anyone have any thoughts on whether we should stick with the old-style
metal/felt seals instead, or it is OK to change to the rubber?
