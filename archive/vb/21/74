Very good idea, and remember that the reason this all
happened, is that there is too much hate in the world
today.  Before we take revenge, keep in mind that
violence begets violence, hate begets hate.  Keep a
cool head, mourn those who died, and wait for the
truth to out!

Religious zealots are the problem today;  love your
brother:  they are all our brothers, no matter how
misguided.

PS  Bus content - I won't have the Grateful Dead bus
ready for Jerome, but come to Busses and Balloons in
Albuquerque October 5, and I'll show it too you at the
shop after the show!
