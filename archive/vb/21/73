crawling under my bus after a tough 250 mile drive home. (long story) I  =
realized that my shift coupler was in very bad shape(couldnt find 2nd =
gear at all being a clue.) i noticed the source of my recent loss of =
tranny fluid. it appears to be coming from the nose cone where the shift =
comes in.  My questions, Is it possible to remove the nose cone without =
dropping the tranny? and if so, could i replace something inside to stop =
the leak, or should i go about aquiring a new one? =20
