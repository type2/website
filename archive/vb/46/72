I smacked my nose with one of those 4-way lug wrenches one time,
gave it a good spin and *BLAM* - right in the nose!  My nose has
never been the same since then, either, I think I messed it up somehow.

It welded the links together and burnt my right thumb while I was trying to rip it off my wrist. A 3" by 1" patch of skin came off as one piece, except for the skin that came off today all crackly. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH! Of course, my busspouse was standing there and thought I was gonna lose my arm.
