Nice project there Thom "way too much free time" Fitzpatrick!  ;)

One question for you...  What axle assembly are you using to get the wide
fives to fit on there?  

I can see the leaf springs, but cannot discern the axle type or what you are
putting on the rear for the drums to attach to.


Thanks,
