I just checked with my local family run tire store in the little town where
I live in West, Central Ohio.  He has an adaptor that he can use on all
wheel types including ours.  It is a modern deal that came with his tire
machine.  It will adjust infinitely to any lug nut pattern and will fit on a
modern balencing machine.  If we have one in a town of 8000 I bet other tire
shops do too...I would keep calling until I found one.  I would bet that the
big "get-em-in-and-out" shops would not have one but the old family run
independant shops might be more inclined to have something like that.
