Last night I was working on the engine and had my left arm across the =
top when my steel watchband crossed the terminals on the alternator. It =
welded the links together and burnt my right thumb while I was trying to =
rip it off my wrist. A 3" by 1" patch of skin came off as one piece, =
except for the skin that came off today all crackly. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH! Of =
course, my busspouse was standing there and thought I was gonna lose my =
arm.

That's the dumbest thing I've done since when I was trying to get an old =
tie rod off and was banging on a prybar, I hit myself square on the =
forehead with a four pound sledge. My wife missed that one, but later =
had to ask why I had a big knot on my head.
