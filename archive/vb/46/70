I found a set on a '59 Panel/home-made camper I brought home a while 
back. They were left under there at least from the late 60's or very 
early 70's. I don't know what I did with them though. I bet I could 
have given you a run for your money on age though!!! I remember them 
looking very "primative" and EXTREMELY rusty.

Funny that happens!
