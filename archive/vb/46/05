Subject: cb performance sump filter

just saw this in vwtrends... a paper filter that replaces the mesh one in
the oil sump. any thoughts on this? my first thought is restricting the
suction side of the pump is a no-no, but maybe other motors do this w/ no
probs.

also, i wonder why vw didn't do this - before they went to full-flow, that is.
