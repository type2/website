Subject: FW: '74 thing FS

Not bus content but it is Friday and the dude does own a '73 Westi so close
enough :)

This car is nicer than the photos indicate.  The seats are perfect.  The
dash is nice.  The correct weird offset wide 5 wheels.  Brand new top which
is perfect.  New convertible hold down latches from The Thing Shop, I think
$40 each or pair.  Engine runs good, but is unknown, does not have oil bath
setup which is a negative.  Typical rocker rust, but seems to be great other
than that spot.  Some moron PO put in a roll bar which comes with the Thing,
but is useless and the holes in the floor need filled.  New white paint.
Needs hubcaps.  Brand new tires, 300 miles-ish.  I believe a new battery as
well..?

I am confident you could jump in and drive anywhere.  If a bus list member
buys it I will give it a tune-up for your journey ;)

It is a steal with a $2500 reserve... Should go for over $4000 in my
opinion.  It is not my car so I am limited on intimate details of the Thing,
but can put you in contact with David the owner...  Heck, if I did not have
the 911 I might have bought it, really fun summer cruising car for the
family.


Thanks for the bandwidth,
