Subject: Vice grips, again

A while back I asked a question on a Friday about who
had ever left Vice Grips on a clutch cable.  Got a
great response from someone (swharris?) about the fact
that I asked the wrong question.  He said I should
have wondered "how many times" some of us had done so.

Well, in working on my new 1957 Singlecab from Nevada,
I found a set that might have been on there since the
fifties!  The patina of rust matches the truck, and
it's a style of Vice Grips that I haven't seen in
years.  Anybody ever found an older set?
