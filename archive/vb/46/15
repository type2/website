Subject: Generator bearings %$#%#

Does anyone know of a good source for generator bearings?

Mine shattered on the last camping adventure and I need some more.  Made a
really ugly sound too, but kept on running fine until I got home.  The sound
was basically the center metal plates rubbing on each other after the
bearings collapsed.

...  I believe I can thank a really cheap "made in Taiwan" chrome pulley for
being the root cause of this destruction.  A while back one broke and I have
a feeling stressed the bearings that later gave up the ghost.  Go with a
German pulley or Brazilian if you need one.
