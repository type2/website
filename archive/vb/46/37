Hey all,

It's been a while since I've mentioned this on list, but I figure it's 
worth a mention.  The Silicon Valley Chapter of SV2s will be having their 
monthly meeting tomorrow night at the Round Table Pizza, 4302 Moorpark Ave, 
San Jose (right off Hwy 280 and Saratoga Ave).  If you live in the area and 
haven't checked us out yet, come on out and meet the volks.  We're planning 
our Xmas party and getting a head start on Bring Your Own Bus 2002 
(tentative date: April 13, 2002).  If you need maps or just want to check 
out our site, it's at www.redshift.com/~taylorvw/svt

Hope to see you there!
-Taylor
