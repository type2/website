Subject: "Westphalia" stickers on eBay :-)

Saw this on eBay; it was definately good for a chuckle (and it is Friday)...

Windshield Decal Kit VW WESTPHALIA by mudpie

Yes, the stickers really do say WESTPHALIA.  :-)
They also come with extra stickers saying HI PERFORMANCE and RACE TEAM ...
perfect for those of us who drag race our Westies.

No, The Bus Depot won't be carrying these. :-)
