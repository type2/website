Subject: Winterizing Bus, Bus for Sale?

Hello Listees,

It has been a long time since I posted to the list. My question is what if 
any winterizing should I do to my 65?  Last winter I replaced everything 
mechanical so I did not worry to much about winterizing then.

I also have to consider selling my Bus.  I really do not want to sell her, 
but I have the chance to study in Florence Italy next year and I need cash.

If I have to sell it i want my bus to go to a good home and I cannot think 
of a better home then a Listee's.
If anyone is interested here are specs.
There are many things I am sure that I replace that are not on list, I have 
at least $5000 in receipts, I just don't have them in front of me If you are 
interested email me and I will give you more info.  I spared no expenses!

Like I said I am not really in a hurry to sell but have to considor the 
possibility.
