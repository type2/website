 How could that be? Things were only imported for the years 1973 and 1974, 
 which is
 a far cry from 1959-1960, or whatever the years are.

probably because the thing was originally used by the german military and 
they wanted it on such a utilitarian vehicle.
im not sure if they came on all the things thru 74  but my 73 has the hole in 
the bumper for the crank ( original engine long gone)
but i jsut got the right bolt to install it again.
