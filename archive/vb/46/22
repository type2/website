Hi Steffan,
My son works for America's Tire here in Pasadena.  He has the adapter that you
need.  As America's Tire is a chain of stores, there might be one in your area
that you can check.  They are part of Discount Tire Centers, so maybe you can
check there too.  Let me know if you need my son's phone number at work.  He'd
be glad to help you, or anyone else on the list with your tire/balancing/wheel
needs.
