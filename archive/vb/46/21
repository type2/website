Subject: Fiberglass ribbed bumpers/floor mats

  There back, after taking the summer off, we're back in production again. I
have plenty of fiberglass ribbed bumpers in stock again, including truck
rears.
  Coming soon, FIBERGLASS split bus front nose panels (1961 and earlier
style). These are being made for decoration or artistic endeavors and are
not intended to be used on a split bus, even though they will fit.
  We also just got in another shipment of 55-59 floor mats, for those that
were waiting and some more of the 60-67 and 68-72 front floor mats. All mats
have the correct waffle pattern on the backside.
