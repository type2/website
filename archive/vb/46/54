hi everyone,
i am selling the SO42 interior out of my bus. it came
out of a 66, and is a non-walkthrough. it comes 99%
complete. all it is missing is one of the little
tables. that means the spice rack is there, the
curtains and rods are there, everythnig is there.
except for that table that goes on the cargo door. the
upholstry is in great shape. there is one 3 inch rip
in the z bed (great place to tuck in the curtain!
j/k). i am asking $600 o.b.o. if you have Dormobile
parts, i will consider trade. thanks!
