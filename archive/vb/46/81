 I found a very original looking late 58 36hp engine minus carb and
 distributor that has a hand crank pulley bolt and the rear tin with the
 flap. Did anything other than a bus come with the hand crank parts?
 
 Thanks,
 Paul
 
I think that all bugs  had hand cranking facilities thru October, 1952. 
That's when the Oval window was introduced. I know that my 1949 Hebmuller and 
my 1952 Zwitter
had hand cranking facilities, while my 1955 Oval window did not. It's not 
very hard to
allow for hand cranking. Just install the hand crank flywheel nut and the 
hand crank engine tin over the flywheel pulley.
