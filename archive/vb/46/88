I used to play when I were a children, but a decided emphasis on hard manual
labor promoted thick fingers and decreased dexterity and reach. It is all a
matter of what you allow yourself to be accustomed to. If you think a minor
discomfort will prevent you from playing, then you are correct, it will. If
you don't think about it at all, it won't. All a matter of choice. Believe
me, if you can stack hay again today with the blisters you got yesterday,
you can probably play the piano with them too. If you do a lot more hay
stacking than playing, the fat fingers will beat you. As long as everything
you do is in balance you will be capable of doing them all. Unless of course
you don't think so. In that case, you will be correct.
