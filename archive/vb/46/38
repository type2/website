Subject: Missing Crew additional info


Randy, the guy that had his crew stolen mailed me with some additional
identifying features of his truck incase it has been painted.   The list
follows.

  "Identifying features: The rear seat support had been louvered; it has
a shifter lock; it has 1 blue halogen headlight (I replaced one with a
standard sealed beam); there is an equalizer hole cut into the dash next
to the radio. Thank you for your help.

Sincerely, ~Randawg.Randy Moore (randawg72(-at-)hotmail.com)714-521-5545. "
