Subject: theft deterrent  (was DC stolen...)

While we're all on the subject of car security...

I had a 66 bug in high school, I installed a 60-amp
non-fused pull-out switch in it under the back seat.

This is a thing normally used on household AC/heat
systems. Consists of a metal box with a plug type
junction in the middle. The wires go into each side of
the terminal, and there's a pull-out "block" with
copper prongs which complete (bridge) the connection
when you plug it in.

For AC, the idea is, you pull the thing out to work on
the unit. Some of them have buss fuses (look like
shotgun shells) in them, but this one is non-fused so
the whole pull-out thing was about 1.5" square. small
enough to clip on your keychain.

I put it in-line between my battey cable and the
starter.


I guess any pro with a set of HD cables and alligator
clips could have jumped this system, but it's an added
inconvenience.....

I guess when DARTHVW is restored I'll get lojack
installed.
