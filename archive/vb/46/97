Ah yes, we could have the annual Darwin olympics. You know the ones, the
grinder discus throw as the grinder throws the part out of your hand and
into *various* body parts. The hurdle, as you and your dolly hurdle from
underneath your bus in search of the fire extinguisher to put out the fire
you started with your torch. The hammer throw, as in exasperation you throw
your balpeen hammer at the floor (insert toolbox etc) and dodge concrete
chips.
The winner could get a firstaid kit in a Haznet box.
