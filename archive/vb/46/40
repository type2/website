Subject: Steering wheel removal

I got a great deal on a steering lock but i can't get
my steering wheel off to put it on. Help me!
All of the removal tools i have found use bolts that
thread into the wheel boss, but vw doesn't have any
holes. My wheel won't stand up to too much pounding,
it's pretty cracked up! Any ideas?
