Subject: Re: [VB] Strangest injuries

Hey, lets make this an annual contest.  We'll call it the ADAs "Almost
Darwin Awards".

While mine are many and numerous, the one that hurt the most and is most
recent is when I was using my brand new 3/4 inch Makita drill motor to
drill mounting holes in the tranny cradle of the truck for the Westy
hitch.  On the second hole the bit caught just as it broke through the
metal.  I was lying on my back with the motor loosely grasped in one hand.
When that bit stopped, the motor did not.   Along for the ride was my hand
and wrist... which about snapped before it stopped.  I ended up with a
finger at a 45 degree angle and most likely broken.   Hurt like hell for 3
or 4 months....I use two hands now :-\
