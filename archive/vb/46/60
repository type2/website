Subject: What is it - the answer!


It's the alternator cooling fan for a 964 engine -
for some reason, this setup uses a fan on both sides
of the alternator; one is the traditional 911 fan,
and ther other is this little jobby on the opposite
end of the shaft.  It's shaped almost idental to a
VW fan, just smaller, and it's made out of plastic.
