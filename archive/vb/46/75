One of the things that makes me nervous about the whole VW (or any
automotive) scene is the potential for hand injuries.

See, I'm a piano player, into classical music and so on.  What would
be a minor hand injury to most people would be totally, er, unacceptable
to me.  I'm scared of burns, bad lacerations, missing digits, paralysis
of any kind, even breaking a nail can be a major setback.

People try to encourage me all the time to do my own metalwork, etc.,
but I'm always hearing stories like this that tend to scare me away 
from any of it.  

I'd be very surprised if there's 10 times the number of listmembers'
fingers here...
