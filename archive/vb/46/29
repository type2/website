"In addition, the quality of gasket kits suck. I have to drive 50 miles to
the closest place and after going there today and getting no help, "

My FLAPS has been busy getting some actual good quality stuff these days,
which is amazing.  But they have Victor Reinz T1 gasket kits if you want me
to get one for you and mail it?  Tom Wilson uses the Victor Reinz gasket kit
in his book on rebuilding VW engines.  The only kit that comes with white
rubber parts.  Normally the Brazilian kits have red rubber parts the
disintegrate quickly, YMMV.

Also they have thick paper gaskets sold separately for the DP intakes!  Some
trimming required, but a much better seal than those horrid metal crush
gaskets.  I think they are $1.50 each, semi expensive but worth it in my
opinion.
