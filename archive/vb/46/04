 No the leak I was referring to was a drip from behind the backing plate

Hi AL,
Is the drip coming from the drip hole the axle seal drips through?  If so you 
need to torque the axle nuts and see if that does it, or next replace the 
spacer that rides inside the axle seal.  If that does not do the trick you 
need to either retorque all the threaded fasteners on the outerside RGB or 
fix or replace all parts scratched, chipped on thier sealing surfaces.  All 
the sealing surfaces on the outside of the RGB should need no silicon sealant.

Still check the jetting!

<< My main concern is rings. Can compression test be run relaibly previous to

after break in?
 The oil from the filler breather tube, and the oil blast I got from cyl 3 
with first hand tunr is my greatest concern now, according to bentley these 
are all bad ring signs, such as improper install or broken rings.       Al >>

That does sound bad.  Could be you got a 30 second or 30 feet warrented 
engine.  The only way to tell would be to tear it down to a short block and 
remove at least a rod to check the bearing and journel there on the crank.
