Depending on how many decide to join in, we can do a simple carne asada deal. 
At the past few BBB's I have brought the carne asada and others have helped out 
with the fixins.

I will plan to bring 5-10lbs of carne.

Here is my family's plan for the weekend.

We plan on heading out Thursday evening and drive to Flagstaff to avoid the 
heat. Kick back at Casa de Fu and head to the camp area on Fri or Sat. Head 
down to Sedona and spend the day and night. Drive back to Cali on Monday.

Really jonesin' for a roadtrip...just gotta get the bus in order.
