Subject: Early BUS turn signal switch for semaphores 

I think I found 3 nos early bus (could be barndoor) turn signal switches in a 
box of old vw parts I was given. If anyone is looking for one e-mail me, I 
have a number of boxes to to go thru I'll let everyone know what other 
interesting parts (alot NOS) I find.
