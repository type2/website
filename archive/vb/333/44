Was written by Chris..................
so a more extensive photo gallery would really help
those looking to replace/manufacture their missing
pieces. .............................................

Chris and Vintage list,
A Sundial photo gallery would be a great idea for all
of the Sundial owners to show off,I mean to share our
Sundials with others who are looking for more info and
examples.
 If anyone would like to see pics of my Sundial
interior or exterior, go to:
photos.yahoo.com/chucknot

then click on Sundial folder. I do have many more pics
of my Sundial if anyone needs to see more detail.
