Subject: Bosche Points

All, in the last couple of months I have come across an odd problem with
new Bosche points on the 009 distributors. After a couple of months they
start pitting badly, you know, holes on one side and mountains on the
other. Anyway, the bad points set is the dull grey and the good points
are the shiny chrome like ones. The question is, why the two types of
contacts under the same part number? Is one of them a bogus knock off
part under a fake Bosche label? For myself, I will carefully check my
points in the future for the shiny contacts.
