Hi Mheron,
Is your bus a 1965 model or built after the begining of AUG1965 which would 
make it a 1966 model bus???  If a 1955-65 bus you just need a two or three 
prong signal relay box from almost any FLAPS.
  If you have a 1966-67 bus, the 1966 and 1967 blinker boxes have nine 
connections and are just the same other than the 6 volt and 12 volt changes between 
these years.  One can make a replacement blinker box from standard FLAPS 
signal relays for these two years of bus production by reading Matt Roberds article 
on "VW 9 Prong Box Troubleshooting and Replacement" in the type2.com Library 
in the "Electrical (Secondary)" section.
