Subject: single/double cab parts needed

Hi everyone,
Since I picked up the newest bus a few weeks ago I've been trying to track
down some missing original parts.
I have about half a set of OG oak slats for the bed.
I've located a complete original set from a guy in San Diego. The kicker is
that he'll only trade for a crew cab set. I'm hoping he does not cut the
single cab ones down as he's suggested he might.
In the slim chance someone might have either a single or double cab set of oak
wood slats, please let me know.

Thanks in advance.
