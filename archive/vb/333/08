Hi Joe,
Check out your battery cables!  If they have those replacement battery clamps 
that are bolted/clamped onto the ends of the cables they will corrode between 
the cables and the replacement clamps causing voltage/amperage drop.  Good 
idea to invest in a voltage meter to check for loss of electrical power in your 
VW wiring.  Could also be time to replace your starter bushing.  Check out 
type2.com for the AIRS list there for volks all over the USA & Canada that will 
have tools, parts, and knowledge of the local area VW scene.
