Neither, with that tranny I'd be running a .009 or .050 dual point.

Well I putting together the 2007 this week and need to know which dizzy
you
all would run on a Westi running IRS (super beetle tranny).

I would rather run the 010 (with both springs) because it is a bit more
rare, and I have not tried it before... But I know that a 019 will be a
great job.

Which dizzy curve do you all like in a bus?

... Perhaps the 010 with one spring?  Granted "all in" would be at like
20
degrees!

Thanks,
