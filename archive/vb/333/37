Subject: RE: [VB] Bosche Points

Thanks for the heads up on the points, I had the plastic piece that rubs the
dist shaft just snap off on me a few weeks back on a set of 01-011 Bosch
points. Luckily I had a spare set in the Bus but did take me few minutes to
figure out why I wasn't getting any fire.
