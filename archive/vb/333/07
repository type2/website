Subject: Rear Side snubber replacement procedure

How does one replace the rubber bumper in the back for a SC!  the bumper
that is by the side vents for when the side gate swings down!  Since I got
the truck all it has ever had is the screw hanging out the hole and no way
to get behind to the back of it that I can find!
