Chris,

Hate to burst ur bubble, with even with those plates, VERY few people
will know ur bus is a Sundial.  BUT, at least we'll know what and who
next time we go crusing thru the great state of Oklahoma and catch a
glimpse . . . !

One of the reasons we drive our busses is their uniqueness.  This
morning my daughter had the Continental so I had to take muh Luvly to
the hairdressers to be made more luvly and then pick her up hours
later.
 Then this afternoon I had to take her to physical therapy and back. 
She just doesn't ride in my Bus much, lets say never.  She was amazed
at
the stares, the looks, the thumbs up and the peace/victory flashes.  I
told her that was half the reason I drive her.  These two  trips were
shorties, only 3 miles or less here in town.  I think she's coming
around!  We drove a Bug all through College and had one in the 90's as
our second car for the boyz too.  She didn't drive it much in the
90's.

Keep driving, keep smiling, keep explaining what a Sundial is.

Best,

Curt
