Subject: motor for sale/value?

i've decided to sell the motor that came in my panel in order to buy a more
stockish motor. it's a 1600 FI case (includes elect. pump). rebuilt 2,800ish
miles ago, i have the paper work from when it was was built at home and can
provide exact milage, and better detail later. webber icts(new at rebuild),
engle 110 cam, berg full flow, remote spin on filter, new dp heads, plumbed
for breather box, elect. fuel pump. still in the panel, you can hear it run,
test comp. etc. carbs need dialing in. built 7 years ago, but the lady just
let it sit most of the time, driving the bus around the block every so often,
and on quick trips to the coast every great once in a while until the brakes
gave out recently. i watched the bus sit on the side of the road in front of
her house for the last 8 years. PO spent alot, probably too much, i don't
know. i'd appreciate ideas on value, open to offers.
