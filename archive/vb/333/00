was excellent.  pretty tired... and I'm waking up early to go to the races.  
drove the 65 westy after replacing the right front drum (the bad bearing was 
involved with the race floating in the drum) with help from Phil of Phil and 
Catherine Friday.  It ran good, apart from the occasional non start issues.   
Burger meet was excellent.. I was late due to slow start and traffic through 
Tacoma, so showed up with road burn.   bus sounds odd with this new carb... good, 
but different.   we laughed at the hot rod low bugs scrapeing over the speed 
bumps when they left.  and the square back had the rear hatch pop up as it 
zoomed out.. maybe it was meant to do that?

     stayed late at the VM  fixing Stephen's 63 Dc brakes.  never got up to 
the show area... was in the swap.  I was parked across from Peter's "Hausmann's 
Meats" 63 DD panel and really nice OG hardtop deluxe with platinum  interior, 
and Alika's westy... some real easy to look at buses.   saw many familar 
faces and met some folks I had previously known through the email only... nice to 
put faces to names.  more later.
