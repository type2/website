Subject: Re: [VB] Obscure Reduction Gearbox Leak

seems to me , aren't new plugs hard to get or a silly price of something like 
that?  Which meant I have been reusing plugs, as I can't get new ones for $3 
or whatever they should be.  So removing it means either welding a bolt to the 
middle and using the U bracket sold with the cheapie oil pump puller to pull 
the plug, then grinding the bolt off
-or-
drilling a hole, using a big fat screw to hit against the inside of teh stub 
axle and push the plug out, then the plug has to be welded up and ground flat 
(both sides.. a little tricky.

oh... clean the edges of the seam between plug and box with a razor first.

then when installing clean the edges really good both on box and plug.  and 
use lots of goo sealer.

I've still once had it leak after that, and cleaned up the spring plate and 
the box really well and slathered it with the rubbery sealer ... might have 
made a paper gasket... anyway... it held.  paper gasket is a good idea.  the 
plugs are a PITA, glad they aren't needing to be messed with much.

For an emergency repair I've had success with making a paper
gasket between rgb and spring plate.
