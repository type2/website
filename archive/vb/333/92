Subject: Buses of The Corm - The American Invasion

I just received an email from Greg Potts telling me that there will be 13 U.S. buses in attendance.  That's outstanding.  Anyone
want to try and make it 20 ;0)  We'll be leaving Harpers Ferry, WV on Wednesday and will be staying overnight in Lake Erie State
Park in Brocton, NY if anyone wants to join us.
 
Joy thru air,
