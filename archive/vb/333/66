Subject: Re: [VB] 12 volt flasher on 65 bus

Go to Wal-mart.  Buy the generic boat trailer light converter.  With some
creative wiring, the turn signal will only operate the turn signals, and not
the brakes also,  they will be separate circuits.  Put both of these into
the box.  With this setup, you will just put one regular blinker relay
before the turn signal switch.  I've done it on at least 4 VW's to date.
