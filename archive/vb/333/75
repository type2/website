Hi Ken,
Sounds like you first need to go through your entire electrical system and 
check for proper voltages at the generator, battery and for any voltage loss in 
the wiring harness, fuse box, ignition switch.  The last two items need to 
have all the connections in them soldered!  Then go to your local older radio 
shop and ask them for a device that uses a dry cell battery to keep the radio 
memory going.
