Here's a diagram of what I'm talking about.  This is the cheapest way to
convert to 12 volts, and do away with the magic 'black box'.

I created this myself over 10 years ago, and have used it in at least 4
VW's.
I may not have been the first to do this, but I haven't seen anyone else do
it that I didn't tell them how.

If it doesn't make sense, I'll try to do a better picture, it was late, and
I was dead tired.

Later
Charles
