Subject: engine #'s

Hello all,
Since I'm trying to get my OG single cab back on the road I have a question.
In comparing the engine #'s to reference points on TheSamba it appears I could
have an early replacement 40hp.
The truck was built in Feb of 1960 and should have come with a Bastard 40.
The #'s on the engine are 0616285, with no spacings at all. Has a German Solex
28-pict on it as well as all the rest of the factoy tin. Bastard 40 oil bath,
etc....

Can anyone clue me in the direction or am I on the right track as to the
origins of the motor.
I have all factory service records for this truck up to about 50K miles.
Currently mid-90K and no signs of a dealer replacement.

Any comments appreciated.
Thanks,
Dave Barnes
