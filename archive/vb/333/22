Subject: 6V/12V starters

Anyone know the history behind 12V starters with a 6V
gear?  Sounds like the perfect solution for my bus as
it will have a 1200 motor but a 12V system.  Was that
a special item or something that someone put together
from parts of a 6 & 12V starter?

I know i can run a 6V starter if i had to but i
located one of these and wanted to find out what you
all know about it.

Thanks

PS.  Still looking for one used rear Axle cap for by
Bus.  (The cap that holds the rear seal and bolts the
brake plate in place.
