Subject: Utah bus cruise reminder

Hi all,

Just a reminder to anyone near northern Utah that the Type 2 Skyline Cruise
(and campout) is only three short weeks away!
If you don't mind getting a little bit dusty (about 40 miles of dirt road
total) and like to camp in the mountains, you're more than welcome to join in.
This year we have All three flavors taking part in the cruise (Split, Bay, and
Vanagon) and the more the merrier!

Here is this years online flier:

And here is a link to pics taken from last years cruise:
