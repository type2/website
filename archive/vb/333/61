Rich,

You've already done the hard part.  Do yourself a favor and replace the 
plugs (I think Wolfgang Ent. or maybe even Ronnie at Old Volks will have 
the correct steel plugs.  I did them on a 65 B. Nut and the old ones 
were so rusted I just hammered a screwdriver through them and pried them 
out.  If they are still solid, you can weld a bolt to them and pull them 
out with a home made puller, or use an autobody dent puller (with the 
screw tip) which I've heard works very well.  

You might have luck with the RTV, but do you really want to do it again 
if it still leaks.  BTW do use sealant on the outside of the plugs if 
you replace them.

Steve
