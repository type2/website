Subject: Accelorator cable (61DC)

Can anyone tell me the length of the end barrel for a
stock accelorator cable for a 61 double cab?  I have 
a new cable that had a end barrel that was about 1.5"
long.  It would not go thru the tube though.  It got
stuck about 9" from the rear of the bus.  (I tried to
push it thru from both ends and it gets stuck at the
same point.

I ground the barrel down to .5" and still it will not
go.  I have traced the tube back to the area and there
is a stock looking bend there as it goes around the
torsion tube area.  It does not look crushed either. 
Seams to me the stock barrel was about 1" long but i
do not have one hanging around.  Anyone know or faced
a similar problem?  I imagine there is something in
there but just thought i would ask.

Thanks
