Hi Mheron,
You should check the type2.com library for our article on this subject!  Both 
front brake lines need to be T-fitting into the later dual MC, which is 
mentioned there.  Are you really having break fade?  Brake fade is due to 
overheating the brakes by using them too long at one time, and this results in the 
brake shoes loosing thier friction properties.
