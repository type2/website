Hi Bill,
Yes, you need to back off the brake shoe adjustment by two or three clicks so 
the brakes just barely rub when the wheel is spun.  Otherwise if the brake 
shoes are dragging so much you can easily turn the outer layer of the shoes to 
glass and distort the drums!
  We really hate cheapie crimp on connectors!  If it is not just like the 
stock VW crimp ons from the factory they will be a problem unless you solder and 
heat shrink them on.
  As for the problem of the brake pressure not releasing as you can see in 
section B-2, page 2 in the VW Transporter Workshp Manual there must be about 1mm 
(.040") between the pushrod and MC piston.
