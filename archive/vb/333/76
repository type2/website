Chris

Congratulations on getting your plates that say
'SUNDIAL'.

I've had the same plates on my 67 Sundial here in
Nevada for about three years and yet to have a single
person really know what the plates really mean. 

See pics of my 67 Sundial at :

I am still stoked with my Sundial even after all these
years and all the trips across this country.
