Subject: Re: [VB] axle boot

hi folks.  normally i just lurk here but i am posting to this topic:
i agree that top dead center (tdc) is not optimal for the seam of the axle boot but i don't like setting it at a 9 or 3 o'clock position either... vw transporter workshop manual be damned.  i set the seams between 10 to 11 and 1 to 2 o'clock, usually seam facing the rear.  i also mush grease into the joining surfaces instead of using sealant.  primarily because, as we all know, our vws love grease and i have more of it on hand than any kind of sealant.

cheers,
