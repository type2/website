Subject: Mogollon Madness show in August

Listees,

So anyone off the list heading to Northern AZ for the Mogollon Rim campout in August?

My family will head out for the weekend and one last hurrah before my daughter starts school.  I believe Ricky Fu and Craig K. will be heading out.

Maybe we can do a BBB-Havasu type dinner feast for Saturday night.  Any takers?
