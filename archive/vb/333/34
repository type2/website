Subject: RE: [VB] Bosche Points

Along a similar line, the FLAP here in Austin, has had Bosch #01-011 points
on back order for almost a month now.  I dug out an old set to use as my
spare that wasn't too pitted, but will keep on the lookout for the 'good' vs
'bad' bosch poitns when they finally get some in.
Thanks

All, in the last couple of months I have come across an odd problem with
new Bosche points on the 009 distributors.
