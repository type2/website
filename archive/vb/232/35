If the clutch pedal bushings are getting worn the bolt at the elbow of 
the pedal can hit the front bumper bracket. That will cause a scraping 
sound and it will also be intermittent, depending on whether on not you 
appy a little sideways force as you push the pedal.

That might be worth looking for.
