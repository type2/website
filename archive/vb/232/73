Subject: Re: [VB] Re drag link tools

Take 2 hammers and back up one side of the arm with 1 hammer (3# sledge
works good here) where the tie rod or drag link goes through and smack the
other side with the other hammer (24 or 32 oz. ball peen works good here).
Compresses the end with a sideload and spits the taper out.

If you have a welder and an old nut you can weld the old nut to a piece of
1" hardened bar stock then screw it on the tie rod or drag link end till it
bottoms out snugly then hit it. The shock load (hammer blow plus the weight
of the bar stock multiplying the force) will pop them out.

Before anyone rags at me about these methods (like hey man you should use
this factory tool,etc.) I have been using both ways (the latter since I
wiped out both shoulders) for 22 years as a diesel mechanic and allot longer
working on my own cars when I did not have the money for fancy tools. I have
the money now (and still use the old ways) but it stays in my pocket till I
need a part for one of my Volksy's where the money is best spent.
