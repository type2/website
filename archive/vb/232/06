Subject: new aluminum block pics

Got my 90.5 punched block back from the shop earlier this week and took a few
pics this morning. My die grinder and wire wheel are ready to go. I will take
care of the offending areas, take more pics, and then take it back to the shop
for a double cleaning. The crank already has a new home since the main ribs
were trimmed and the align bore of 2 thousandths fit the bearings properly.
Now all I have to do is find out how the lifters and cam fit. It's an Engle
110.
