Subject: California, Smog and VW's  (New CA smog law introduced)

(I searched the archives and did not see this already
posted.  If it was, sorry.)

Anyone who lives in CA may want to read this bill.  

The vote is scheduled for the end of this month.  If
you drive a 61 to 73 bus (or any car for that matter)
as a daily driver (over 12K/yr) then you will have to
have your car smoged if this one passes.

I personally do not have any VW's that i drive that
many miles on but i know that many people do.  If you
oppose this bill please contact your local senator.
