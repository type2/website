Subject: Clutch funkitude/tranny update

My second week with the rancho tranny and the 1600 in my '65.

I get a sort of odd sensation when depressing the clutch - a sort of rubbing feeling, almost like the disc is dragging on the mainshaft.  Sometimes 
there, sometimes not.  It's wierd.  Could be in the linkage, I guess.

I also am getting a carryover noise from when the engine was in the '71, which must mean potential gland nut badness -- again, a very inconsistent 
release-bearing type noise that mostly happens when the pedal is completely depressed (but this same release bearing was there before, and no 
noise).  I may do some exploring this weekend and will report back what I learn.

The setup is in general working very well, though there's more noise than I expected (whine, mostly).  That may go away.
