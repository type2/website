Yes, it's called the "trading real money for a fake cashier's check" scam.

They don't want your rack, they want the $$$.  Your bank may well accept
the cashier's check, but weeks or months later (we're talking Africa
here!) it will be found to be fake and your bank will say "so sorry" and
take the money back out of your account, leaving you holding the bag.

This has been discussed once before here on one of the bus lists.  The old
dictum holds, if it seems too good to be true, it is.
