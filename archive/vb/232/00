Hey Joe,

I just put on a set of KYB gas-a-just on my '66.  I like them a bunch.  I
enjoy the stiff ride feel myself, and I have noticed a lot more of a stable
feeling in cross winds.

I picked them up from the FLAPS at about $35each.

Good luck

My '65 really tends to hop starting off in 1st, especially if I'm going over
a bump at the same time.  And speed bumps make me sproingy.
