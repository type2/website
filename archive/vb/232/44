Personally, I would be very involved. Not many insurance companies have tables
for older dubs and even less shops are available to do the work. (I would ship
my truck to Kelly any day, regardless of cost!). I was rear ended Dec 27 and
the insurance company just shook their head, asked me if I could do my own
work, and wrote me a check for $350 plus my $500 deductible, all for a bent
bumper bracket and a dent in the right rear corner. I tapped out the corner
and bent the bracket back straight, then took the family out to a nice dinner.
Later I bought the infamamous #4141 aluminum block. For me at least, I do my
own work where I can.

i saved this until friday because the reason for my post started with my
beetle... but my question touches all my vws.  i would like to take a poll.
if your vw was involved in an accident and insurance was going to pay for the
repair, how involved would you be?
