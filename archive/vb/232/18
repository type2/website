 the flywheel and starter correct. Can I assume that

 it the bellhousing has already been ground out?
 ................
you can assume, but I'd measure and check (ie your 12V FW should be slightly 
smaller than the ID of the bell housing)

 would a 130-tooth even fit in there if not?
 ....................
you could mush it in, and grind it out w/ the FW, but better to make sure 
it's clearanced first.

 How can I tell if the starter is a 6 or 12 volt?

says on the starter body

 How can I tell if the proper bushing has been
 installed to use a 12 volt starter?
..................
if the wrong bushing is in there, there will be a gap between the starter and 
the bushing.  You may want to get a new bushing anyway, as they are real easy 
to swap out with motor out, but a bear when the motor is in.

oh ya, as long as the motor is out, go through the motor out checklist... 
clean connections on starter
check/replace screen in fuel tank/ as its a 61 make sure the push pull fuel 
tap cable is free and remove and make sure the fuel tap doesn't leak.  WW 
sells rebuild kits, worked great for my fuel tap in my 61.  remove tank and 
shake out old rust? 
new fuel line
tranny boots, change trans oil9center section AND RGBoxes
grease clutch cable threads, make sure wing nut moves easily
engine to body seals, grommets for fuel line/ battery cable, etc
rear brake hoses
? shocks

etc
seems like a lot, but these maintenance things are easier w/ engine out, save 
time and hassle

 I noticed some metal shavings in the bellhousing and
 on one spot of the flywheel, like maybe something
 wasn't right...
 ...............
that happens sometimes, like if the bell housing was clearance but the FW 
rubbed in a spot, you'ld get some shavings.   As long as the FW teeth are 
okay, don't worry.

oh ya, if you are going 12V, make sure all the bulbs are 12V, including the 
dash bulbs and dome light bulbs.   Use 12V 5W dome light bulbs, or if you use 
10W ones, leave the covers off or they melt.

enjoy your bus!!!!!!!!!!
