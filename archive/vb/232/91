Mmmm, if you must use an impact driver be careful.
The threads for the bolts inside the door pillars are
in small plates that were tack welded.
Any sufficient whack may well break the weld so that
when you eventually get the bolt out the plate will go
sliding to the bottom of the pillar.
Friends have had it happen.
Using a small gas torch to heat the bolt heads often
breaks any rust as well.
An oxy torch is too strong but a torch that you use on
your pipes in winter may do the job.
I used an LPG torch.
Just be careful about how much heat you feed into it &
let the bolt cool for a few hours or even over night
before you try to turn it.
Take that from me.
I found out the hard way with a set of drop
gates......
:o)
