I think you misunderstand.  You put a big hammer on one side of the pitman
arm (where the drag link taper goes through) and then whack the other side
with the other hammer.  This squeezes the end of the pitman arm slightly
which tends to dislodge the taper.  You don't strike the hammers together
directly.

I'm very leery of applying a hammer anywhere near the steering box, but
this method will work in a pinch.  I prefer a chevy pitman arm puller
with an appropriate spacer cut from angle iron.
