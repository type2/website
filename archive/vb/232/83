Subject: cooling test report

well, just a little bit.    I was futzing with the best way to hook things 
up, and that may still have to be adjusted, 

but it looked like the engine ran about 5 C hotter with the engine lid 
cracked open (not latched closed, but not propped up).    The engine 
compartment temperature was also higher.

I was using a thermocoupler.   I am not sure exactly what it reads, but I 
think it tells the difference in temp between the two wires.   I was going to 
put one at the spark plug, but because it was easier, I attached it under the 
tin to head screw near #2 spark plug.  The outside wire stuck out the engine 
vents.  How hot do people's engines with head temp sensors run?  I had the 
impression that it was about 250F at idle, and 350F under way.  ?????????

engine compartment pressure was not linear with how fast I went in 4th gear.  
 It generally was a bit lower than ambient (about 760 mmHg compared to 764mm 
Hg), but was higher at 60 and 65 than at 55 or 70.

probably no big surprises
