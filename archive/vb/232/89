Hey Vintagebussers. Lurker here... couple friends of mine are planning a
spring cruise from North Vancouver B.C to  Alice Lake. We would like to get
a few more participants and anybody willing to tote something along in there
bus would be welcome. The info is pretty much all up on there on the website
and any other questions can be directed towards me or Anna. Thanks guys and
if somebody could also forword this to the Wetwesties crew that would be
most appreciated.
