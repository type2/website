well, but the numbers you quoted were 55, 60 and 70! so the rpms 
aren't that low, nor are they that different. i'm wondering if there 
isn't some sort of fun phenomenon going on like vortex shedding, or 
maybe the bus' drag curves reach a 'triple point'  - at 55 and 70 it 
is sucking down more air to push aside the air piling up in front of 
the bus, lowering pressure in the engine bay. at 60 to 65, it is in 
balance with power output, drag and air consumption, meaning the 
scoops ram in more air than the motor needs.  what the hell do i 
know, i failed colidge physiks. twice.

c'mon clara, make em build you a big honkin wind tunnel in the 
parking lot!! they can even put all the burnouts in the smoking area 
to use to make the smoke streams!  :)
