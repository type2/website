Subject: RE: [VB] Old stove 

Ronnie,You Win! That's the stove! I found out that they are no longer available (fuel cans) so I grabbed an old stove, a torch and some solder. I converted it to propane from the LP gas, which is butane I have been told! It works great and I can use it to cook and not as an anchor for my canoe!  Sean65 Westfalia70 Westfalia
