Subject: doors and thier hinges

recently i purchased a bus and i noticed that the lower hinge on the pass 
front door is mounted backwards, and sticking outside the door(obviously 
non-functional). it looks like the hinge was busted from the door and it 
was mounted that way to just get it out of the way. the driver door hinges 
are a bit stiff and while i was looking closely i noticed that the metal 
is breaking around the hinge mounts, at least the lower one for sure. 

is it going to be difficult to repair these doors and thier hinges? will i 
be better off finding replacements?
i imagine they can be fixed, has anyone had experience with this problem 
and what i can do to right it and keep it from happening again?

thanks,
matthew
