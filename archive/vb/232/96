Subject: Questions.

I've got a couple questions.  First, how do I know if my wheel cylinders are
bad or not?  I'm having to replace my master cylinder, and am not sure
whether to replace the wheel cylinders while I'm at it or not.  Second, the
hinge pin on my gas pedal keeps coming out of the hinge, how is the pin
supposed to be secured in?  Thanks.
