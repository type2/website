Hi Sam,
We actually had the frame for one of those windows from a US military fellow 
we met at Sacramento VW meet who had been based somewhere in the Caribbean 
where he found the rusty remains of the bus.  He traded us the frame for an 
ash tray we had.
  A few years later we found out in Xering Iowa in a wrecking yard a 
beautiful absolutely straight, OG paint, rust free 1958 panel van that 
someone had recently had cut open the roof and taken out the whole slider 
window through the roof.  Tossing the rest of the entire bus into the 
wrecking yard there!  If the bus had been nearer to the PNW we would have 
taken it home and repaired the roof.......   The wrecking yard owner also had 
a swivel seat panel van and a rusty 1957ish Delux sunroof for sale cheap!  If 
only for a trailer and truck....
  At our Vintage show up here about eight years ago there was a kombi that 
was a special ordered from the factory OG 1958 bus still had its original 
running Bastard 40 HP engine with about 30,000 miles on it.  It was for an 
egg farm out here.  so the driver could stay warm up front while the eggs 
stayed cool in the rear!
