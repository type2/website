Subject: horn wire routing

So here's a quick question for you guys. My bus came to me with no
horn. I picked up a horn at my VWFLAPS and got it partway hooked up. I
found the how wire down below that provides the current & hooked it to
the horn. Now, my real question is how is the wire from the horn
button routed. I assume it is connected to the center of the horn
button & down the inside of the steering column, but there is nothing
there to compare with and I'm not exactly sure where the exit for the
wire might be. TIA. Oh this is on a 66 westy if it makes any
difference.
