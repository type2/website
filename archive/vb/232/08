My client said i should tell you he would be issuing you a United States certified cashers checkof $5695 while you wire to me $5000 through western union money transfer point which in paying for the shippers that will come to your location for the pick up of the wood slat roof rack immediatly the check has been cashed at any cashing store center in you location.  And he is also giving you a compensation amount of $300 in the effort it will cost you in doing all this processing PLUS the cost of your wood slat roof rack$395 making the total sum of $695 for your all.
