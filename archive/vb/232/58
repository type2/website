That belongs to a shop close by (Vans VW's) he is clearing out another 
one of his lots and the cars in  the dirt lot with the sign are being 
crushed. I was down there a week or so ago with Van (the owner) and 
pulled some misc. pieces off a couple Buses. I'm sure he's willing to 
deal on them since they are otherwise being crushed. Call him directly 
and tell him I sent you.

Here's his number 707.576.1216
