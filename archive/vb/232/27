I don't know if this is possible, but could the rancho tranny actually
be pushing the throw-out bearing farther than necessary? causing more
pressure on the bearing & some noise or even binding? Just a thought I

what the stock travel distance is :)

the clutch adjuster nut would make the noise go away. worth a shot I
guess.
