Subject: Winston-Salem to Ohio trailre transport

I just bought Jamie Auch's little Applby tent trailer
and now I am looking for a way to get it from the
Winston-Salem area to the Southwest Ohio area.  Anyone
taking any trips along this route in the near future? 
Maybe even part-way, like a relay. Hand-off to
someone, then hand-off again, then hand off to me
somewhere along the line?  I can give you some bread
for gas money or give you some bay-window parts.
Thanks & PEACE!
John Baker
