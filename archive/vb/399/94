Hi,

I had a 15 gal 71 tank installed in my 64. I did the POR15 tank sealer 
first. This of course was a used tank, however in 1st class condition. It's 
kind a pain to do the job right, but I figured that in the long run it was 
the right thing to do. Be sure to install a new exit filter screen. Make 
sure you pad the metal tube going thru the tin with a piece of fuel line or 
other rubber protector. Maybe a grommet.
