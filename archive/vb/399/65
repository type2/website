Hiya,

Used to have that problem when my little plastic fuel filter would get 
clogged up.

The fuel pump would try to pump gas, but the gunk in the plastic filter 
would get sucked up too, and block the gas from going through.  If I 
pulled over for a minute and shut off the engine, the gunk would settle 
back down in the filter.  It would start right back up, but shortly after, 
would die again because the gunk in the filter would once again get sucked 
up and block the line.

This may or may not be your problem, but if you use those little plastic 
filters, you should ALWAYS car a couple of spares.  At about a buck each, 
they are cheap insurance, but if you don't have a spare, and its 11:30 pm 
on a Sunday night, that little chunk of plastic can become a real 
nightmare.

Peace,
