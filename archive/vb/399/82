Tristan,

Interesting idea about the electric helper pump. However the check valve 
wouldn't work too well. Usually a check valve takes a small about of 
pressure to open it up. The head in the tank is only about 12" if its full 
and maybe 1-1/2" when its almost empty. To put that into PSI terms: 0.3psi 
full and .038psi empty. I'm going it think about the problem some more. Most 
likely I will reroute the line a little and add some insulation. Polishing 
may help a little bit, but I bet most of the heat going into the line is 
from hot air conduction rather than IR absorbtion.

 How can I prevent a vapor lock in the future? Insulate the solid line?

 Polish the stainless lines to a reflective finish?

 Alternatively, maybe you could install an electric pump close to the
 tank, that way you're almost guaranteed to be pumping a liquid.  I'm
 thinking either as a complete replacement for the mechanical pump, or
 maybe a 'helper' pump in parallel with a one-way valve from the tank
 and in series with the mechanical, wired so it only runs with the
 starter is cranking (crude ASCII schematic follows):

         |---[2]-->|
 ---[1]-->|         |---[4]--->
         |---[3]-->|

 Where 1 is the line from gas tank, 2 is electric pump, 3 is a check
 valve, and 4 is the mechanical pump.  The check valve allows the
 mechanical pump to bypass the electric pump when it's not running, and
 prevents backflow to the tank when the electric is running.
