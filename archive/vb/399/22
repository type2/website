Wow,

Scored a set of really nice hubcaps. Triple plated! Very smoooooth. Hope 
they don't rust by next week. $$$$.... These are show caps, not driving 
caps.

Also picked up a set of engine flaps. Never had those before. Maybe I'll 
pull the engine this summer and install them. Gotta get ready for those cold 
California winters.

There was a lot of old bus stuff, but nothing else I needed. Was a lot of 
rubber(as expected), some door handles, misc. engine parts, basically looked 
like a swap at one of the shows. They did segregate the parts by type. I, 
II, III etc.
