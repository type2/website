Hi

....new to Vintagebus site

I am trying to get my 67 Camper on the road after it has sat in the garage
for 4 years. The body is in pretty good shape. I am trying to get the engine
running smoothly.

My first project is to replace the fuel tank.
I bought a new tank from a California parts dealer.
Looking through the Tech articles I found a very informative piece by
Richard Atwell(DIY Fuel Tank Restoration). The article has made me wonder if
the tank I bought is good quality and weather I should I consider sealing
the inside with this product Por-15.

Any advise?

Peter
