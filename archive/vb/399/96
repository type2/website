Hi Peter,
Have heard of plenty of problems with the repro gas tanks.  Would  just get a 
1967 OG humpback tank if going for a full resto, or a 1968-71 OG  bus tank 
for the extra five gallons.  For the latter using either your old  bad tank neck 
(if you had a gas tank) or perhaps the repro tank  neck.
  Installing a reserve switch is really nice in either case so  you can have 
a one gallon reserve, and an easy way to shut off the fuel  when changing fuel 
line, removing engine, etc.....
