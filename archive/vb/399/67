so you had no girls in your auto shop. at one point when I was a Mini 
Cooper addict, we thought of packing the whole engine in ICE.  the 
smell of boiling pee, YUMMY! coming out of the engine!  However, and 
this subject does come up on lists of people who camp outdoors in 
their VW vans, which is to say the ways of collecting our body waste 
materials is a subject of some complexity. Considering the rules at 
campgrounds and elsewhere. but carrying some water in a squirt 
bottle, that is do-able. i am always terrified of getting cold water 
on hot engine parts and getting fatal cracking of block. I am 
reminded of a time when my spouse ran a chevvy dry of  radiator. SOB!
