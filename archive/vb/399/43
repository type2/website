Subject: RE: bumpers

Ed, Most 59's have the later style, but it could be a leftover from 58. If
you look at the valance where the brackets go thru and its rectangular, it
should have the later bumpers if the hole is oval it's for the earlier
pressed bumpers. Of course that could have been changed as well, the m code
and date of manufacture could tell you a lot about it.  Also a 59 should
have the shifter farther away from the seat like a later bus. 58 it should
be closer to the seat. Later and I hope this helps.
