Subject: RE: [VB] patching water tank

Sounds like JB Weld. I'm not sure if stuff like this is ok to be in contact
with potable water?

I eventually had luck with the torch, it took a while, but seems to be
holding up. Now I need to figure out how to clean it better. The water
doesn't taste too good out of it. It used to taste better.

Any cleaning suggestions?

Kevin and all with a patch need.
We found this two part epoxy at a RV store, we think it can be found 
other places.
The name is not known as we do not have it with  is but we do most of 
the time to repair anything!
Production description,
Cardboard box red, white, yellow and ?
Two plastic jars inside about 3 in  dia. 2 in high also wooden tongue 
depressor  sticks to stir with.
This stuff  works!  We may have sealed up our EZ camper water tank also?
