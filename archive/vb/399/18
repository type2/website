Loren is unloading all of his old stash of parts, plus a few cars.  I just
happen to pass by there on Saturday and managed to get stuck there for hours
sorting boxes of parts!  I hated it so much that I went back on Sunday and
spent another 4 hours doing it again!

There are all kinds of early parts there, from NOS body parts to obsolete
rubber pieces to VW toys.  I even found an NOS Type 3 Ghia outside scraper!

I'm not affiliated with WCM or Lorenzo, although I worked there many years
ago.
