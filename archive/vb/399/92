In 1986 we drove from L.A. up the 5, somewhere out to the Washington coast up
past the rain forest and then took a ferry out to Victoria. Camped for a
couple days, ferried out to Vancouver for the Expo. Then on to the Okenagen
Valley for a wedding. Drove back down and headed for the California coast,
thru the bay area and then down the 101 to L.A. Still have the same bus.

What a road trip! With my wife and both my kids.
