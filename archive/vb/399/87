this is actually not so. in fact, the curing process seems to have 
literally NO END since concrete keeps changing. It is very mysterious 
stuff. all of the chemical reactions which go into its formation are not known.

ALSO, it will eventually crack, despite rebar, thickness and careful 
formulation and curing. and crack control joints. In my other life i 
was an architect, am married to an architect who specialized in 
concrete structures. cracking is the nature of concrete, not a bad 
thing, it is just what it eventually does no matter what.
