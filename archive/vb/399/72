Hi Hermine,

I figure that if the gas can make it past the 2 filters, whatever is left 
will make it thru the carb, burn in the cylinders and make it way out the 
exhaust. Have you ever seen the filter in the tank? Its pretty fine. Never 
seen anything in my pump filter either. I have cleaned it (there wasn't 
anything actually there to clean)  a couple times over the years.
