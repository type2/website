That's good advice.  For curing, I recommend plastic sheeting over
the whole slab and keeping it wet underneath for at least a week.  It's a
pain to keep it under plastic for that long, but in the end you get a much
stronger slab and reduce the chances of cracking.  As soon as the slab
gets dry it ends the curing process.

I had some sewer work done several years after my slab was poured.  They
guy had to break through part of the four inch slab to get at the line.
The plumber remarked on how tough it was to break the concrete with his
sledge.
