Subject: Documentation project needs a new host

Long time since I've posted here!  IIRC, Friday is for less-on-topic
posts, so here is mine.

The Obsolete Air-Cooled Documentation Project *gasp* (OACDP, hence) is
currently hosted for me by my employer, for free.  This is very gracious
of them, however I will be leaving the company in two weeks time so this
arrangement will end.

The site averages approximately 1GB per day total, of which the majority
is OACDP traffic (primarily PDFs).  Size is 645MB and may grow, albeit
slowly and rarely.

The site is completely static HTML.  OACDP could use some love and
maintenance, but it will also serve most people just fine as it is.  It
could use a new maintainer, too.  The rest of failsure.net will be hosted
elsewhere.

If anybody is interested in hosting this please let me know!  I would like
to keep the site ad free, but will happily place a "Hosted by..." link on
the front page if desired.  Detailed traffic info:

Thanks, and sorry for just coming in here to beg!
