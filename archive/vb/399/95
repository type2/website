As I understand it, the curing process depends upon water.  The curing
process continues within the slab where water remains, but as I understand
it the idea is to keep the surface wet so that the entire thickness of the
slab will complete most of its cure rapidly (as in a couple of weeks).  I
had always understood that drying out stopped the process, but I'm just
going on what others have said.  To be safe, I keep things wet for a lot
longer than a typical concrete contractor would.

Yeah, the guy who did my slab was amused when I told him to add more
joints and the  actually measured their depth.  No cracks, though!
