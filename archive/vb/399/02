Canvas- at least $2000 if split window? Beware several bay window  
tilts trying to be passed as split window. Hoops- $1200-1500+-????
OG hoops selling for $600-800+-, saw a set of very nice SC hoops, og  
bows, & spreader bar for $1000 (-at-) BOR last weekend, don't know if they  
will get it?

YMMV,
