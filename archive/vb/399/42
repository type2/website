Subject: 1959 Bumpers

Hiya gang,

I have a friend with a '59 camper that has bumpers with over riders, 
pretty much the same bumpers as on my '67 Sundial camper.

Recently, I saw a '59 panel for sale that had pressed bumpers, the old 
style.  The bumpers were not attached, and I was wondering, are these also 
the correct bumpers for a '59 Panel?  Is it possible that the panel was 
not sold/shipped to the US Market, and these are correct for bus not 
exported to the US?

TIA
