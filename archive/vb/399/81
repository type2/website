Polish the stainless lines to a reflective finish?

Alternatively, maybe you could install an electric pump close to the
tank, that way you're almost guaranteed to be pumping a liquid.  I'm
thinking either as a complete replacement for the mechanical pump, or
maybe a 'helper' pump in parallel with a one-way valve from the tank
and in series with the mechanical, wired so it only runs with the
starter is cranking (crude ASCII schematic follows):

         |---[2]-->|
---[1]-->|         |---[4]--->
         |---[3]-->|

Where 1 is the line from gas tank, 2 is electric pump, 3 is a check
valve, and 4 is the mechanical pump.  The check valve allows the
mechanical pump to bypass the electric pump when it's not running, and
prevents backflow to the tank when the electric is running.
