Couple of ideas that I have used, not all successful
on each use.

Silicone sealing layer over the porous area on the
inside.

Hot melt glue sealing from the outside.

Large plastic bag liner in the tank with a hole for
the exit area.

If desperate, seal up the whole exit area with
silicone, but this is a last resort as you can't take
stuff apart later.
