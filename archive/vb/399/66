i have been brought to dead standstills by vapour lock with many a 
car, including Chevvy pickups, which are major workhorses, if nothing 
else.  it does seem to me the smaller the car, and the hotter the 
conditions, the more likely one is to get this happening, and I 
confess, i have never gotten past it except by hurling a bit of fuel 
into the carb and firing up the car like a maniac. I always feel 
nervous doing this. and last time it was with an older big heavy 
momma Chevvy pickup truck, on an exit ramp with a stoplight which 
amazingly turned green after a while, with lots of motorists behind 
me, in full rage because I had deliberately destroyed their lives by 
stopping  in front of them.  I am interested to see what cures for 
vapour lock will emerge on this list.
