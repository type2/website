Subject: Vent Window Woes

Subject says it all - I didn't take the little black thing out for painting 
and just painted that the colour of the vent.  Then when putting them back 
together I not only scratched the swoosh when cutting the rubber such that I 
now have to repaint the swoosh - but I broke one of the black things that 
holds the latch - so ... I had to drill out the black thing that hold the 
latch and replace it - leads to my question.

How do I re-attach the black thing to the frame.  I guess it was originally 
riveted and I was considering using pop-rivets to replace it but ... will 
that interfer with the glass? The original rivets were very small and pretty 
much flush with the black thing in the inside - that won't happen if I use 
pop-rivets - wow is me - what do to?
