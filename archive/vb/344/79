Subject: Re: [VB] Rear shift rod coupler replacement

what year is your bus?  

I think 60-66 1/3 you just undo put the bus in 3rd gear, undo the two screws, 
and wiggle the coupler out.  other years you have to disconnect the front 
linkage at the coupler there (which tends to be more rusty), then you can slide 
the rear shift rod froward enough the wiggle the rear coupler out.  At this 
point, you may well want to replace the forward two shift rod bushings as well.

Hi -

    In the Bentley - this procedure for removing the rear shift rod coupling 
calls for removing the engine & tranny.  My shift raod coupler is in a pretty 
precarous state and needs to be replaced.  I loosened it up and it almost 
looks as if it could be removed if maybe I removed the front shift rod and slid 
the rod up? 
    Surely there is a trick to this?

    thanks
