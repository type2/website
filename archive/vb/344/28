Subject: you gotta wave

Finally, a Friday rant, not that I don't have rants, it is just serendipitus 
that this one falls on a Friday

Please inform anyone you happen to run into (whether an owner or not) or 
sell an air-cooled VW that it is a requirement of ownership that you wave to 
other air-cooled VWs.  Sometimes perhaps the unique drone of our esoteric 
powerplants may send us to louts land, but the sight of those freindly eyes 
(read headlights) should be enough to break our reverie.  'Nuf said.

P.S.  Yes, I have been drinking, what of it?

P.P.S.  Perhaps the poor little beasties have fallen under the control of 
evil overlords!

P.P.P.S.  Maybe I shouldn't have listened to that guy at the party back in 
'79 who said "Take this."
