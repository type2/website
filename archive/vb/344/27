Subject: Mid-Atlantic Holiday Bus Fest: two weeks away...

Saturday December 4, 2004, 1-5pm.

10 years of inviting all you fine folks and your type
IIs to our home!

This is a family event in beautiful downtown Takoma
Park MD, inside the Washington DC beltway. Kids, dogs,
significant others are welcome and will find there is
much more to do than just talk VWs.

By happenstance, the downtown Takoma Park Merchants
(lots of interesting and funky stores just a block
away) are having there holiday shopping weekend too!

Bring something to share and help us celebrate a
decade of these great get togethers. Photos of many of
the past events are at Tom Carrington's site,
http://volksweb.relitech.com .

Long distance travellers are welcome to camp in the
driveway, but spaces are limited so reserve yours now!

We are always happy to help bus owners get together to
find that elusive part they need, so if you want to
bring something down that might be of interest to
others, fine, however this event is in the middle of a
residential neighborhood: keep it subtle and don't
plan
to set up any tables or the like. 

Hope to see you in two weeks, advance notice not
required, but if you do plan to come feel free let us
know for planning purposes.
