I think  the 1600 is a t3 item as in 1600TL and the like.


Hi Sean,
We know the type 3 scripts and they are punched out of aluminum  like the 
Volkswagen script just under the rear hatch on  the post-1962 buses.  This 1600 
script is shaped, cast,  and chromed just like the 1500 bus script.  We have 
found a  very early 1968 panel bus that the original owner still drives in town  
here and this same 1600 script was on it when he bought it off the  VW dealer 
lot.
  Does anybody have any info on the 1500 bus script?  Even would  be 
interesting to hear about the month/year buses they were found on.
  Perhaps someone with the VOA to dealer circular letters would have  this 
info.  We only have these letters from 1955-59.  Would really  like to trade VW 
info!
