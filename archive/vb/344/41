Hi, I  posted my brain droppings earlier about changing out for more modern  
stuff. Why wouldn't Snoopy change to a 12v  flywheel?



Hi Coocoo,
Well in the first place if he installs a 12 volt FW it will not work  on a 6 
volt system!  Later if he does switch to a 12 volt  system with having a six 
volt 200mm FW and starter, it will more  likely start up even in the coldest 
weather.  We have run this setup  on our 1960 panel camper conversion for over a 
decade and many, many  miles with only routine maintenance required during 
this time and no burnt  out starters.
