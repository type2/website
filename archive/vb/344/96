Hi Tommy,
The 1972-79 bus dual circuit MC will fit pre-1968 buses and give  you the 
safety of having at least half your brakes if a slave (wheel) cylinder  or brake 
line blows out.  Go to the type2.com library for the article we  wrote there, 
and make sure to check out all the other info there!!!  Cost  of conversion is 
as low as $50.00 if you do a bit of wrecking yard hunting for  small parts.
