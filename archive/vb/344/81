Richard -

	As far as your 62 pickup is concerned you could list it on the classifieds here on type2.com. The value of it depend on rusts, whether it is single or double cab and whatever people are willing to pay! etc... Missing gates is a bit of a bummer I guess. 
	I would be willing to trade some "restorable" furniture for it ;-).
