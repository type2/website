Subject: Re: [VB] Rear shift rod coupler replacement

All you need to do is remove the 2 bolts that hold your shifter to the floor 
and then slide your shift rod forward as far as it will go. I did this in 
the dirt at jerome one time, it was not a problem. have also done it this 
way numerous times on other buses as well.
