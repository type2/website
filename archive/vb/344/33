Subject: 6 volt 1600

I am upgrading from a 1500 to a 1600 in my 65.  I presently have the non O 
ring flywheel from the 1500.  Will this work, or will I need a different 
flywheel with a spot for an O ring and what size flywheel?  This is on a 
otherwise stock 65 6 volt bus.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Snoopy
