Subject: Re: [VB] Bus in video

  There is a split in a country video. On CMT or one of the country channels( or maybe it was VH1) they had the 
hottest 20 female country singers and one of the top ten has a split bus for a split  (no pun intended) second in the 
back round. I saw it 2 days ago. Of course the number one female was Shania (sp), but Dolly was still up there along 
with Faith and a whole bunch of I never heard of's, but they were all hot though.
