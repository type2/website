The Sheryl Crow video is Soak up the Sun with a beautiful Kombi.  
 
Then there was Atomic Kitten with It's OK, shot in Cape Town, South
Africa.  Most of the video features a 356 Convertible on a coastal road
just outside the little village of Gordons Bay, where I live.  Towards
the end of the video they meet with some surfers at a beach pub with a
Split Panel amongst the cars.
 
Steven Curtis Chapman does Live out Loud with a bunch of happy people on
a road trip in, I think, a late 50's Delux.  The bus plays a big hero
role in the video
 
There was also Blink182 with First Date, featuring some grass smoking
youngsters messing around in a split.
 
I've heard about the SHeDAISY video for Passenger Seat, but have never
seen it - anybody know where to find it??
 
Thought for the day:  It's not having what you want, it's wanting what
you have - Sheryl Crow - Soak up the Sun.
