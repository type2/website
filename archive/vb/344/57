I don't know about the details of the serial number, but I have an old
Chilton's that lists A series as a 1200 motor valid through July 1960.
I wonder if the X could have been stamped on later to indicate a
rebuild.

 From the best i can come up with it has to  be a 40 hp, an "x" as the last
 digit usually refers to a 40 hp part. Could  be an early bastard forty.

 Hi Bryan,
 Doubt that is an official factory engine number for a Bastard  40HP engine.
 Especially since our parts books show that letter  designations before the
 engine # did not start till AUG65.  Having an "X"  at the end we have
never seen
 on an engine ID number.
