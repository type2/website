Subject: Re: [VB] Spot Weld Drill Bit

Any of the tool trucks, Snap-Ons are about 40% more then on-line sellers but have a free replacement warrenty, pays 
off in the long haul s they are only good for about 100 welds then go dull or even sooner. Astro pneumatic (sp) makes 
a spot weld drill with a depth gauge that is awesome. You can set the thickness of what you are dilling and only go 
through that layer!
