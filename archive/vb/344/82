Subject: NEATO Calendar Photos please!

For the Nov/Dec issue of NEATO's Old Bus Review I'm looking to do a 2005 
Split Window Bus calendar of the worst junk yard photos I can find! If you 
have any good bad photos of splitties where they have sat for years I would 
love to see them and see if I can get them worked in to a calendar! When it 
is done I will also have a link put up where you go and get a pdf of the 
calendar also!   Help me please!   Send your photos to captoaster(-at-)cox.net 
please!
Thanks
