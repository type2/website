Subject: Freeing up a stuck engine 1500SP

Hey Y'all
I have aquired an engine that has been sitting in a
damp shed for a few years, PO said ran great before it
was stored, only 67K miles, but now appears to be
seized from sitting. How do you all suggest trying to
free this engine up without damaging rings, etc?
Putting some kind of lubricant into the cylinders thru
the spark plug holes? What lubricant, motor oil?
Penetrating oil? Something else??
