Subject: Xmas Gifts for Bus Owners

Just a quick note that I have put up a holiday gifts page. While much of
what we sell isn't exactly your typical Christmas gift (a new muffler under
the tree, anyone? :-), there are some notable exceptions. Besides Bus Depot
Gift Certificates (the most useful of all Bus holiday gifts), we also have
Bus-themed tableware sets, T-shirts, books,  awnings, tents, etc.  Feel free
to forward this URL to your significant other.  :-)
