Subject: chime in

Eric and Barb,

I have been monitoring this bulletin board for quite some time and
received some great information. I liked it so much I sent in a donation
when requested.

However, I don't know how to use this board, when I want to chime in on
something or ask a question.

Can you help me with this?

Thanks a bunch,

Jason
