Subject: Re: [VB] 6 volt 1600

Why would you want to keep the old one?  I am not arguing here, really, but 
I wonder when I hear discussions about keeping older technology.  Aside from 
a bonestock, keeping-it-original desire, I don't see any advantage to keep 
an older flywheel and a 6 volt electrical system.

I am no expert, believe me, but I have replaced everything under my bus 
expect the front beam. Whenever I need to service a part and there is a 
modern, better part that fits without much modification, I change it. Bigger 
brake drums is a good example. I have "thing" drums in the gront for a 
bigger brake surface.

So, here's a Monday discussion subject, talk among yourselves.

I am upgrading from a 1500 to a 1600 in my 65.  I presently have the non O
ring flywheel from the 1500.  Will this work, or will I need a different
 flywheel with a spot for an O ring and what size flywheel?  This is on a
 otherwise stock 65 6 volt bus.
