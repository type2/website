 WTB : Split window, any year, prefer 1967.  Not a double or single cab.
Looking for solid shell with good interior a bonus.  No engine, not running,
bad tranny, no tranny - not an issue.  Preferbaly in the northeastern united
states.  For sale cheap, or consider trades.

I grew up in New Jersey and I can tell you that 'solid shell' and 'northeastern US' 
do not belong in the same paragraph :-)

Neither does 'solid shell' and 'cheap'!
