Subject: Rear shift rod coupler replacement

Hi -

	In the Bentley - this procedure for removing the rear shift rod coupling calls for removing the engine & tranny.  My shift raod coupler is in a pretty precarous state and needs to be replaced.  I loosened it up and it almost looks as if it could be removed if maybe I removed the front shift rod and slid the rod up? 
	Surely there is a trick to this?

	thanks
	-rob
