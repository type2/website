Subject: RE: [VB] Bus in Videos

	Bee Gees made a music video in 2001 with a bay window the song is
called: (This is where I came in). Most of the music video has them playing
the song in the bus as they go down the road and at the end of the video the
bus breaks down and they get towed away.(Bummer)


Anymore videos?
Eric
