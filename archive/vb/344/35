Subject: Re: Restore - frame and floor rot

What used to be considered OK years ago is not-so-OK now. For example, 
in the 80's there was a guy in Corpus Christi that sold fiberglass 
front floor board panels to cover the rust beneath your feet. I saw a 
Thing in Port Aransas that someone had used a Stop Sign fiberglassed in 
over the rotted front floor. Stuff like this makes it really hard to 
sell a car nowadays.

As far as frame rot goes - unless you have money to burn or are 
restoring a very early deluxe (and you have money to burn), run away as 
fast as you can.

Check out Kelly's site (www.metwiz.com) for info on replacement panels. 
Also good to see what is involved with replacing those areas.
