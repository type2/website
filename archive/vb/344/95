Above each of the front cab doors the metal at the weatherstripping channel is
rusted out.  Anyone on here have any donor metal or know where I can find
some?

Also, has anyone tried to fit Alan's B-Pillar pieces yet?
Dan I'm sure I have the donor pieces you need.  Alans B-pillar pieces are 
very good quality.

E-mail me.
