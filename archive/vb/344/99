Subject: Re: [VB] New engine

Just say NO to GEX!
Although there are some who have had good experiences with GEX engines, the large majority have not.  Do a search in the archives, Samba forums, ramva, you name it....stay the hell away from GEX.

If you want to pull a trailer, I'd say a stock tranny with a 1776 or a 1800.  If it's built right, it;s not gonna be cheap-even if you do it yourself.  Good reliabilty and should have the torque to pull the trailer.

The faster you go in a bus, the hotter the engine is gonna get.  Even more so when towing.  I pulled several trailers with my 1800, but kept speeds reasonable.  With buses, when you change gearing (freeway flyers) you'll lose climbing power to gain speed.  Even more noticeable with a trailer.  Stick with the stock big nut tranny (65) and see how it does.  You should be able to cruise 65 easily with a 1600.

Speed costs money...how fast do you wanna go?
