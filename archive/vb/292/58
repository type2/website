Subject: 65-67 front seat pics

Does anyone have any good pics of what the front seat finished in the
mesh gray/gray upholstery looks like. this should be the style
included with the campers. I'm looking at perhaps getting some covers,
but would like to see a pic before making up my mind. Thanks.

I haven't had good luck with the sambas gallery yet, but still
looking.
