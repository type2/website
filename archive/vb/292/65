Paul,

Any leak is a serious situation.
A 2" diameter puddle after a week means that you are losing a lot of oil.
When you are running, the leakage will be greater. You should check your
tranny oil level as soon as possible. It's prolly low. I've been thru
this, almost ran my tranny dry, with only a tiny drip every once in a
while. I figured it's only a tiny drop. I ran it down to half capacity
in 5000 miles, before realizing the tiny occasional drop was draining my
tranny dry. Almost ruined the tranny - the jury's still out on how much
damage was actually done. Seal that leak asap!
