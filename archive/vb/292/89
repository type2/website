Actually, I think it's easier to start your engine on fire by driving w/o a air cleaner and having it backfire out the top of the carb (BTDT).  The bong action, er oil bath, filters work nicely.

Yes definately change your old fuel line, you can use the old stuff for grommets and a tube for you accelerator cable so it doesn't cut into the tranny.   I had old fuel line fail in a sitting bus, and the smell of gas led me to find gas dripping out from under it!!!!

get the correct diameter braided fuel line.   With this I use clamps where the gas in under press, but not at the tank or into the pump.  works for me.   That inch size stuff will slip off.
