Subject: Re: [VB] Ugly 65-67 front seat pics?

Any picture you get will be different depending on the light conditions,
type of camera, etc. Why don't you call some parts places that sell seat
covers and get them to send you samples of covers that you are considering?

ON the quest to find any pics of a 65-67 bus w/ the stock mesh
gray/gray I still haven't found any :(

Is this combo that ugly. seems like every pic I can find had a
different seat cover. I pulled some of the "cover" off my pass seat to
see what it looks like, but that crap is UGLY! I suppose I'm just
trying to decide if I want to go with the stock color scheme on the
front or just go with something else like the kombi gray from earlier
models, but not sure if the material I am looking at has simply aged
bad (i.e. yellowed).
