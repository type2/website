Subject: Re: [VB] engine modification???

The 1600s slip right in w/ any modifaction to the case or heads.   just like using a set of 1500cc ps/cs.

I recommend swapping the old rod bearings for new while you are at it.   you can do this w/o splitting the case.   If you take any old one out it should have the size marked on it, get the same size for new ones.  I think a set is in the region of $10.   The Muir how to keep your VW alive book has a good explanation of how to remove/ install rods.  make sure you keep the halves together as they are sets.
