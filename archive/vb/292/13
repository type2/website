Hi Jon,
That will work to start it up.  You need to hook up the generator if it is 
the type without the regulator bolted on top of it.  Running a generator without 
a regulator will result in a burnt out generator in less than a minute!  As 
far as safe it depends on how you are going to supply it with fuel and secure 
it so it does not fall off a shelf for instance.  Do have a fire extinguisher 
handy and if it is the dry powder make sure the powder inside it is not caked!  
If you can not get a sandy swoosh when you turn it upside down you need to 
pound it with a rubber hammer till it does.
