Subject: Turn Signal Cancellation

Hiya gang,
Got a problem with the turn signal switch in my 67 Sundial.  The turn
signals don't self-cancel.  I've removed the steering wheel, and the metal
tab is on the back that cancels the turn signals.  When I turn the wheel, I
can hear the "Click" of the metal piece engaging the metal tabs, but they do
not cancel.  I'm wondering if this could be a lubrication problem, or an
adjustment or what?  Any suggestions?  Other than this, the turn signals
work fine.

Thanks,
Ed

ps-I've tried adjusting the turn signal switch both up and down on the
steering column, also adjusting it slightly to the left or right, but none
of this works.

Ed
