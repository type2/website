Subject: A Very Off Topic Post

Just wanted to say that maybe this, maybe next or the following week I am
going to disappear for a while to Shands hospital in Gainesville, after
disappearing this weekend for Miami.  My very best friend needs a liver.
She needs it NOW or yesterday even .. At Shands they can take a section of a
healthy liver - plant it into the patient and it will grow to full size
within a month.  SO .. If mine is compatible [blood type] and if it wasn't
injured in the 70's and 80's with my partying, I am going to be that donor
.. I think it says one month to recover for the donor.  I am pretty sure I
can work from home and if my office doesn't understand - too bad.  "That's
what friends are for."  I am nervous and hopeful at the same time.  Cross
your fingers.  I will know more in the weeks to follow.

Diane
