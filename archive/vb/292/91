Subject: tranny retainer ring

I'm in the process of a tranny swap for my '61 double cab.

I'm trying to remove the retainer ring from the tranny to let the 
axle be removed. I bought a pair of removal plyers from Sears...but 
guess I got the wrong kind. These have different ends that can be put 
on them and they just plain aren't strong enough.

Which ones can I get from Sears, or Home Depot, or Lowes, that will 
be strong enough and appropriate to remove this big ass retainer ring?
