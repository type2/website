Subject: Re: [VB] Shifter thingy bolt size?

So - I've been scratching my head trying to figure out what happened to the
two bolts that hold down my gear - shifter plate thingy (they were painted
black so -- I wanted to use those.)  I've just looked in my engine bay and
noticed two bolts holding down my gas tank - are those the same thread
size - but jut take a smaller socket - i.e. have a smaller head - even tho
they are the same bolt.
