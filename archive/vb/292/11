Subject: Re: [VB] Interesting reaction at a show today...

People have to remember that for MOST Americans, VWs (old air-cooled
anyway) are still considered "throw away cars".  These cars were for
their time just above a Yugo of today.  You'd not think twice about
cutting the roof off a Yugo would you??  In the 60's and 70's they were
everywhere and always cheep.  

We who prize "vintage" VWs today seem to forget that there are LOTS of
people who could care less about cutting up a VW.  There's always
another one some where cheep....right???  Some people just don't realize
that air-cooled cars are collector cars and they still see them as
"throw away" type cars.
