Subject: Gas drain tube behind filler flap in dual cab

Greetings All,

Just working on my trusty but very crusty oz crew and am wondering
if crews have a drain tube running down from the  gas tank filler spout 
support(like other splits?).  Hard to tell with mine cos not much was left there.
If no tube, surely overfill spillages just don't end up pooling 
on the floor near the gas tank?

Thanks

RobK
