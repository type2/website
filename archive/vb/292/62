Subject: Double-Cab fuel drain pipe...

Hi all,

My May of 1959 Double Cab had no fuel overflow drain pipe provided by VW and
it was occasionally annoying to smell gas when the tank was full or the fuel
expanded in the heat.  So while it is under restoration, I had my buddy fab up
a stock looking (similar to my '67 Westy) drain pipe into the filler area
sheet metal below the neck.  It should catch any overflow and the pipe passes
through the floor and will drain to the ground instead of the sealed interior
floor area.  Hopefully, problem solved!
