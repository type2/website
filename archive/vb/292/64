You're a fool not to, if you don't mind me saying. You almost lost your
eye, whether you realize it or not. I used to be that way, then an eye got
hit with a tiny bit of metal from a drilling operation. That was it - I
wear goggles for everything. They're not putting replacement eyes on sale
anymore at Sears, and I don't have the money anymore for the full-priced
ones.
