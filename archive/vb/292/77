Never mind I found the answer to my question. That answer is too late in
the evening to be messing with this stuff.


Thanks Again

    I have a set of of rear bumper boots that came off of my 67 deluxe
and I want to use them on my 65 deluxe with a slash rear bumper. But
they only work upside down. Is there an early version of these boots for
slash bumpers? 


TIA
