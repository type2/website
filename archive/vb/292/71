My Chicago delivered 67 SC had 269K prior to the speedo going bad according to
the stack of oil change and service receipts that came with the truck. I
figure at least another 5K since then according to my 15-300 mile weekly
driving. Is there a million mile club like Mercedes?

anyone have any good, hi-res scans of the 100,000 km badges, etc? the
70 is gonna roll to 100,000 miles today, thought i'd make it a new
decoration with the printer.  i assume vw made a miles version, as
well... anyone have scans of that?
