Subject: Interesting reaction at a show today...

Hi,

At the Novemberfest show in Austin today, a gentleman brought a 1960 
single cab pickup that he had "chopped" the top off of - leaving the 
bottom half of the windshield and window frames intact. He had 
fashioned slidebolt fittings so that he could put the top back on in 
case it started to rain (which it did most of the day).

I heard quite a few people stop and "jab" at him, and it was 
interesting to watch his reaction - as almost as if he didn't expect to 
get so much gruff. There was a category for "most likely to have a 
puddle on the floorboard at the end of the day" - and one guy stopped 
by to comment that he was voting for him in this category. Again, the 
response was less than friendly.

Amazing that some people are that far out of touch. Like, if you took a 
bus like that to a show - you'd have to expect to get some flack. 
Wouldn't you? And no, the top was in pretty decent shape, so I think he 
just did that to have fun (which I think was one of his comments to 
someone).

At least if I had done something like that, I would have used the 
cop-out of "I bought it this way."

Conrad
