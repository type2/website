Subject: siezed piston!! help!!!!!

hey all,
 
 my new/old 1500cc has a seized piston, any advice? i got it off just far enough where i cant sledge it with anything cause i got it on a stand. and i need 2 pistons at least cause they are broken, literally. i got this engine for free from a dude just south of me and i need it for my bus. thanks in advance,
