Subject: Re: [VB] Gas drain tube behind filler flap in dual cab

Sometime in the mid 60s, they started the drain pipe, although i have not been able to trace down
the year yet. I know a list member had one on his 65, thats the earliest ive found it. And ive only
found DCs with it so far, no SC's, not to say that SCs dont have it or anything.

DC is coming along Robert, looks good.
