Look at pages 609 and 611 of
http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5867part.htm .  609 has the '64-down
assembly on the left and the '65 assembly on the right.  611 has the
'66-'67 assembly.  Some of the parts (like the frame) are common to the
'65 and '66-'67 assemblies, but others (like the wiper shafts) aren't.
If you have a crusty '65 assembly, this might tell you what you need to
save from it to make a '66-'67 work.

Good luck!
