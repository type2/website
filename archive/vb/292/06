Subject: Re: [VB] Shifter thingy bolt size?

they are the usual 13mm, or in your case 14mm headed M8 bolts.  yes, probably about an inch long.  if you mean to hold the stick shift onto the front floor.  and use washers.  came w/ a wavy washer and a flat washer.  they should be the same size, but as long as a thread or so poke out under the bus who cares.    unless that bothers you, in which case you should look it up in the online parts list in the 711 section.  hmm, doesn't specify length.

list says N 10 242 5     bolt, hex head M 8x25
