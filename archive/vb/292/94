Subject: [VB] preventing engine fires (fwd)

Good reminder and topic!

In this months Hot VWs there is an article on gas tank maintenance and 
tapping it for NPT fittings.  From this information here is what I am doing.

First off I took the tank to get acid dipped to remove all rust and debris 
from the inside of the old beast.  $50 but well worth it IMHO.

Once returned I proceeded to use POR-15 gas tank sealer to prevent future 
rust issues...  Right now it is curing, jury is out for the next couple days 
on how that comes out, but it looks good so far.

... Well let me back up, if you are going to all this expense and PITA you 
might as well get a Bay tank that is good for 15 gallons, which is what I 
did :)  Not a direct bolt on swap, but not hard either.

I tapped the regular fuel outlet with a 1/4NPT tap and then got an Aeroquip 
90 degree fitting that goes 1/4NPT to -4AN.  From there I will run a line to 
the bulkhead and cut a hole for an Aeroquip -4AN bulkhead fitting that is 
separate from the motor front tin piece altogether.  From there the line 
will go into the fuel pump.

Here is the cool part, an early fuel pump that uses metal as a side screw in 
is a 1/4NPT fitting already!  I thought that was cool at least.  So the line 
from the tank to the pump is easy as pie.

Here is the rub,  how can you really run AN lines on the pressure side from 
the pump to the carb?  I have little faith in the old pressed in brass 
tubes...  They come out way to easy!  I have considered epoxy of some sort 
to keep them in along with SS wire to hold them back in case of failure, but 
kind of jinky considering how nice the feed line is.

BTW Wolfsburg West has old fuel pump rebuild kits.  Very easy task.

In the next week or so I hope to have a technical article posted on 
www.germanlook.com about this whole conversion.  Also Thom has information 
posted on www.vintagebus.com about the Bay tank conversion.

Take Care,
Adrian Pillow
