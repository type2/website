Don,
IMHO, keep the 1500sp (best engine VW ever made), save yourself a bunch 
of cash. Spend some of the saved cash on a Bentley book and a 
micrometer and maybe some tools you want but don't have. Take apart the 
1600, rebuild it yourself slowly as time and money allow. Sell the 
Kadrons on Eb*y. Look for some Dellorto's or Webers if you want to stay 
dual carb.
Just my 2 pesos,
Andres Yver

alternator can be fitted on a new 1600 dp longblock?  Here's my
situation:

I have two complete motors in the garage. <snip>
