How much drag at the center point do you set your steering box to? I
adjusted mine and there is isn't any play in the steering but it seems sort
of tight at the center point. Also on mine there is a noticible clunk when I
rock the steering wheel back and forth. Plenty oil in the box, and very
little or no play in the steering.

Really nice to not have that grinding noise from under my feet anymore when
I turn the wheel, steering feels really good, except i still need to adjust
the column, at least I hope that's it, as there is still an inch of free
play.  And this bus does have much better heat than the other.
