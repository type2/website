Dood, you just said the H case is a good running motor.  

FWIW it may be a 1600, if it was ever top end rebuildt, the heads are the same 1500/1600, just if they put a new set of 1600 ps&cs in.  Ever try to get new 1500cc (NOT big bore 40hp )ps&cs?   Not that easy.   

Anyway, just change the oil and adjust the valves when you oughta, or even chaneg the oil early if it gets dirty.   I have had good luck with mystery motors as long as they came to me w/ decent compression, no excessive end play. 

If you feel like spending money or having a spare motor handy, use a later alloy dual relief case for the next motor.   I suggest SP for reliability, but others will say go DP for power.   DP heads, well, they dont like me.  Ya full flow is good.   

So since that type 3 block has low compression (under 100 is low) why don't you check the end play. Write it down.   Then loosen crank pulley nut and FW nut  (read yr Muir and Bentleys) tear it down to the long block, then remove the heads and inspect for crack between plug holes and valves.  At your leisure you can clean up (repaint?) the tin

remove the ps and cs and do the ring in the cylinder test (as per Muir)  are the cylinder walls scored?

check slop on the connecting rods. remove the rods and check the wear on the rod bearings.   If the lower end is good you can get new rod bearings and pcs and cs and heads (or new rings and heads depending) heads are cheap last time I looked.

or get someone else to rebuild it.   But it'll be neat to take it apart and see some of the workings inside.

Read the Muir engine rebuild chapter. 

the thing is, people aren't going to give you much for a core motor ( I wish, I have extra cores)
