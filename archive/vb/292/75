Subject: Re: [VB] engine modification???

While you're balancing, better get your crank balanced too. I bought a SCAT
CW crank and took it to Jake Raby get the engine balanced. The crank was way
out of balance! Jake said SCAT cranks were some of most unbalanced CW cranks
he has ever seen.

I assumed that a CW crank came balanced. I mean isn't that why you spend the
extra bucks to get one?

All you need to do is remove old (1500?) P&Cs and install new 1600 P&Cs.
While you are at it, it would be nice to install a CW crank, have the FW
balanced
to the crank and balance the rods and pistons.  Really makes for a smooth
running engine!
