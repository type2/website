Subject: A-frame towing

Does any one have any pointers on the towing of a vehicle with an
A-frame.  I bought a second hand A-frame that I will be using.  Since I
have never towed a vehicle in this fashion, any pointers on the subject
are welcome.  Specifically:  How (and where) do I attach the A-frame to
the bus?
