Subject: Re: [VB] Gas drain tube behind filler flap in dual cab

My '63 DC is OPEN to the fuel tank area behind/below the filler neck. Any slop out of the tank ends up in the tank area and if your forward bulkheads aren't air-proof, you'll smell gas for miles. Design flaw if you ask me! I've dropped my gas cap in there several times!
