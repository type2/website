  Well the boys from the land of Swiss chocolate got the engine out of their
westy, took them a few hours but they did it. They started to remove all the
parts from the engine to get the heads off and discovered that it had been
in a fire, lots of melted stuff on the block. They had to chisel off a
couple exhuast bolts but all looks well.
  Tomorrow I will take the heads to be reworked and then they will install
new P/L put it all back together and hit the road. The goal is to be done
and out of here Thrusday.

  Looks like I am getting a couple new guest at the shop. 2 guys from
Switzerland in a 79 Westy. They bought this westy in Cali and were headed to
Canada then New York when they had an engine problem in Needles, Cali. One
of them is a certified Swiss mechanic so I am going to let them pull and
rebuild the top end of their engine here. Wish them luck.
  If anybody would like to meet them along their journey p-mail me and I
will give them your phone number and address.
  I do not know their exact route yet and will post it to all list while
they are here. Very nice people on a across the U S and Canada tour (in
winter?)
  When they leave here they are going up to Canada, then Alaska, then east
to New York. I hope they will get to meet some of the great people on these
list during thir trip. I am also going to print out the Airs list for them.
