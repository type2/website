Subject: Valve setting

When my engine was new I was checking had adjusting every few hundred miles
as things settled in. Now I'm at around every 1500 miles and see little
change in the settings. BTW I have chrome moly push rods, prefered by my
engine builder so I set them to .002. Builder says to set them to zero but I
found the engine hard to start. I supose I was losing compression thru
valves not fully closed until the engine started to heat up.
