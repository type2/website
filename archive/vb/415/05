Kevin,

Did you read Heat, Rust, & Noise in VW's:
http://www.shagadelic.org/VW/info/gmbulley-soundproof/index.html

I would go with filling only the ribs as shown on the Interior Out, Noise 
Proofing page
http://www.shagadelic.org/VW/info/gmbulley-soundproof/intrir1.html

Watch out for other areas. Water does need to be able to flow out the 
bottoms.

I sealed up the gaps on the cargo door hinges to minimize water entry. I 
used some 50 year rubbery stuff from the Depot and then painted it to match. 
At some point I will do the front doors hinges too. For now, each time I 
wash the bus, water pours out from the bottoms of the front doors.

 So I now have everything stripped out. I'm bringing it by my mechanics shop
 to begin/determine the amount of body work to have done. I noticed on one 
of
 the soundproofing links, the idea of spraying some type of expanding foam
 into any channels in the frame of the bus. I know there are certain areas
 you are not supposed to do this-because you want water to flow through the
 doors-etc. Has anyone on the list done this, have any recommendations for 
or
 against? I wa thinking-as long as no water is flowing through the area, and
 if I can't actually get any thing else up there-as far as soundproofing,
 putting the foam should not hurt, I imagine it can only help. Right?
