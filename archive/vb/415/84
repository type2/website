Subject: wipers, windows

Just going over different parts on the bus.

I just got the Hehr crank out windows out, and am going to be going over
them in the next week or so, trying to polish/clean them up as much as
possible.

I also know that my windshield wiper does not work, or rather it works super
fast-it is an original 6V, but I upgraded my bus to 12V. I know you can use
a voltage drop, but I've heard they burn out over time. I think I'd rather
get a new mechanism in there. New being a relative term. I have a '65 bus,
what type/year mechanisms will work in here?

I also like the idea of a 2-speed switch. Then again, 90% of the time I
don't bother with the wipers, and just try to keep my glass really clean,
and use Rain-X, then the water just rolls off.

I think that Wolfsburg West was selling a replacement motor or something
that you could swap in-to convert the mechanism from 6V to 12V, but it
supposedly does not work for a '65. I'm not sure why.

Suggestions appreciated...
