God damn! First response, that was the exact image I was looking for. I
thought I had seen it on your site, but could not remember where. I was
looking at newer buses, I didn't realize it was a '55.

Thanks Thom, and thanks to the list! Now next question, what are those
colors? Anyone know?

If you have the larger version, I would be very happy to get a copy. Also-is
this part of a larger advertisement, or was it just a postcard.ie is there
more info to go with it?

Thanks,

-Kevin
