Kevin -
And if you're not inclined to build your own, look for and get EMPI
00-9344-0 Wiper Conversion Kit which has a rheostat for variable speed
adjustment.  I've used several of these over the past 15 years, real nice to
have.  Never had one burn out yet.

Mr Buese is correct. 1965 Wiper Motors are an animal until itself, nothing
interchangeable with the later 12 volt motors on Buses, Bugs, Ghias or Type
3.
