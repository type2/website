Very informative article John. I agree with your comments on clear
coat and second David's comments on failed clear coats.

I was a little confused by your final recommendation. You said you
would never use PPG Epoxy on bare metal, but above you seemed to be
saying that you spray it on bare metal, then follow with rust defender
and then again with PPG epoxy. Did I get that right? If so, I was
wondering how rust defender would help if it is not sprayed directly
on the metal.

Thanks,

John K.
