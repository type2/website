Subject: Wiring harness broke on the way out

I had a young friend working on my bus, and while he was pulling out  
the new harness to put in a new one, it broke.

We tried using a HBFreight sewer snake to thread in - but it gets  
jammed at the rear torsion tube. I'll probably see if I can rent or  
buy a more beefy sewer snake.

If you have any thoughts I'd appreciate it.
