Subject: Re: [VB] choosing paint color, 2-stage vs single stage

Kevin,

Howdy, good to hear about your progress. My bus is L289 blue white over L512 
velvet green. You've seen my photos. If you want any more let me know. The 
paint shop should be able to get very close with just the color numbers.

As for single stage or 2 stage paint, someone else should comment on that.

Chris
