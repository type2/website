Subject: Re: [VB] bus all apart & glass questions

I had the glass in my 64 beetle tinted with the film ..its been 10 yrs and  
it still looks great. But I'm sure you can talk to any glass shop.. flat  
glass  with sandwich tint was $10 per sq foot when I was doing Street  Rods

Well I  got everything out. It is pretty stripped down. I dropped it off 
with
my  mechanic today.
He is going to start cutting out the rust section, and  begin next stage of
prep before the body work. He said he'll call me when  he has that done, so 
I
can come by and take a look. He just cleaned out a  bay of his garages to
have some room for my bus.  

It is pretty  exciting. I'll try to photo as much as possible.

I was hoping to  replace the glass in my cranout windows with some type of
laminated or  tempered glass with a tint. I don't need/want a heavy tint. I
just want to  mostly block the UV rays, as my curtains got ruined pretty
quickly by the  sun before, and that also wrecked part of the original
upholstery in the  back. One guy I spoke with suggested the applied film, 
but
I don't like  that idea, as I imagine it scratches easily. Anyone have
experience with  the applied films? Or other suggestions? I think laminated
glass actually  acts better for sound as well.
