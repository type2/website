Hey all,

My 61 corner window bus has a 4.375 r/p with big nut boxes(1.26 reduction) and 
bus .83 4th.?? With a 1600 sp and 205 75 R 15 tires I think it has a good 
combination of perkiness/hill climbing ability and can happily cruise 60 all 
day.? It took hwy 58 East over the cascades in 4th gear.??? that was?a 
couple?years ago... I have a lot of miles on the motor now and it might want to 
shift down earlier these days

My 56 westy has the same gearing, though it has a tranny out of a 63 bus?with the 1 
ton?little nut boxes with the 1.26 reduction, not the usual 1.39 3/4 ton little 
nut boxes.? 1600sp and same tires as the 61, and it gets about 25mph 
average?over the 16,000 miles we've had it on the road.?? When gas was over 
$4.00 a gallon? it was getting 27-29 mpg? :)

It seems real similar to the 67 gearing with a 4.12 r/p with bus 4th and big 
nuts with 1600 and 195/75 R14 tires? 



I used to have?a 65 westy (the shiny green and white one), and I put a 3.88 r/p 
tranny with big nuts .82 4th and? 195/75 R 14 tires and it seemed underpowered 
with the tall gears and the heavy camper kit.????? Once I caravanned with some 
Cascade Kombis over the Yakima when Bob Freeman was driving that green/green 
barndoor with the custom camper kit, and my 65 with the tall tall gears was 
pulling the steep windy back roads through the mountains more like the barndoor 
with the 36hp than a normal splitty.?? That was before?I put he new 30-pict 1 
solex manual choke carb on, which did pep it up, but still it could have been 
better.?? I think that gearing might?be better with?more motor than a 1600dp.? 

Then again, my Dad has that gearing in his 63SC and it is real peppy.?? It has 
about 10K miles on a new 1600 dp Mexi-motor.??with a German 34-pict carb and 
009.???A SC may weigh less than a camper full of stuff???? 

Ya, the dissappearance of reverse, usually after some popping out of gear, tends to imply a rebuild is the cure.???? You can always check the shift linkage and rear coupler, with hope, though.

While the actual rebuild of the center section is a job for the professional tranny builder, removal and installation can be done by the handy VW owner.?? If you have pulled an engine, you can pull a tranny.?? Read up in the Muir book and the Bentley.?? You will need a 27mm socket for the big tranny horn bolts, and to take the rear brakes off? to get to the RGBs.? Loosen all big bolts (lugs, axle nuts, RGB bolts, those 27s) before jacking the bus off the ground, and drain the gear oil before pulling the tranny.?In fact,?I take the outer RGB housing off , and upper gear while the tranny is still in the bus

Then there is the removal/re-install of the boxes and axles.?? This is a bit fussier and smellier than the removal of the tranny.
Also, unless you have a local shop who does the tranny, shipping a whole rear axle will cost a LOT more than shipping the center section.??

If you have the 1.39 little nut boxes and want the 1.26 big nut boxes, well, this is the time to swap them over.? Then you have to find a set of big nut boxes. complete with backing plates and drums.?? Which maybe you already have.?? Might as well put all new beairngs in the boxes as long as the center is new.??? Or ask the tranny builder about their cost of boxes/rebuilding them/ shipping?
Or, you could get a 3.88 r/p and keep the little nut 1.39 boxes.??

? In any case, make sure the boxes your using have nice threads for the RGB bolts.??? I like to tap them clean so I can thread the bolt in by hand, Use anti-seize when installing the tranny.?? Broken bolts and drilling that hardened steel is no fun at all.??? In fact, I'm working on a 63 bus and 2 were pre-broken on one RGB, and a third broke on removal, and so I'm changing that tube an inner RBB out which is easier than drilling out three broken hardened bolts.??? ARRRGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!?? The tranny is out and soooooooooo in the way in the garage, but that is a different story.? Nevermind.

When we put the new tranny in my Dad's 63 SC I think the basic rebuild from Rancho?was around $400.? But?it got a new crown gear/pinion gear set.?? This cost about $100 extra.?? Brand new.?? The new 3.88 r/p was about $175 extra over using a 4.12 or 4.375 ring & pinion.? Also got?new fulcrum plates and all new RGB bearings.??A stub axle needed?replacing as well. new rubber tranny mounts, shift rod bushings, shift rod tube dust seals, axle boots etc.? I don't think there was much if any change back from $1000 for the parts.

It is also nice to paint the drums (outside, not the braking surface) and the backing plates and axle tubes black, like they did when the bus was new.?? the tranny case was NOT painted when new, however, so I have asked the tranny builder to leave that bare, as often they will paint them..???
I am wanting powdercoating backing plates.? So sleek.?? ?So far I haven't ponied up the cash for that yet.


Hope that helps!
