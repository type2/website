Subject: motor blows black smoke.....

Hi all, thought i would post this problem.
 
I drove my 67 w/1600 SP on a 500 mile trip. I noticed i really was sucking
some gas mabey 15 miles a gallon tops. engine developed a clinking noise that
is consistant with the revs of the motor (sounds like and exhaust leak while
sitting behind steering wheel) and now puffs black smoke out the tail pipe. No
noticably reduction in power. Did i ruin my piston rings? I guess its motor
pulling time.
 
Anyone have a similar problem?
 
Thanks,
 
Ken
