Subject: RE: [VB] Whoa!  Backup and check out that tranny!

Well, it appears I know much less than I thought I needed to about the
reduction gear boxes and the transmission in general.  You are all quoting
numbers and such while I am going, uh... how do I tell what I have, let
alone pick the right ratio that works?  
 
That is a question for me to get smart about by digging into the archives
and other resources.
 
For now, it looks like most people are happy with the original tranny + RGB
system, so I will look into updating/fixing that rather than going with a
newer 'flier' version.  Thank you all for chiming in.
 
Happy bussing!  I have some work to do.
Greg
