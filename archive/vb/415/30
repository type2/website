Kevin,

I looked at the photos of the hinge on the vwispwest web site. Looks pretty 
good to me. As long as the dimensions are good, I would expect they are, you 
should be OK. If they are exactly as in the photo, expect to do some finish 
work like sanding off the sharp edges and corners so that it looks really 
nice when its painted.

BTW, Ispwest did the restoration on my bus and I'm really happy.
