Subject: Re: [VB] wipers, windows

Kevin,

I have run the 6V motor on my 12V conversion for 30 years with no problems. 
I rather like having fast wipers as they are somewhat useless otherwise. 
Of course I live in So. Cal where it never rains. I would look into a speed 
control rather than a resistor.
If you are so inclined to build your own, here is a circuit that can be 
built for a few dollars.
