Subject: top of cargo door

Does anyone have a close up picture of the top of the rear (left facing the
doors) cargo door? I just noticed that there is an odd piece of metal on
mine, right behind the rod that goes into the body to lock the door. I was
wondering if it is in the right position or if it has been bent, as I can't
quite figure out what the metal piece does. I could imagine ifit was bent a
little differently it would/could act as a soft catch for closing that door.
