Subject: valve adjustment frequency

I'm just curious: how often to folks out there adjust their valves?

I feel like I'm a bit of a nut about it...as I tend to check them before
each major (300+ mile) trip, and this results in me adjusting them 
every 500 to 750 miles.  

It pays off, as I frequently find one or two that are just off by a touch,
but I feel like I'm being a little too anal retentive.  

How about you volks?

Cheers,
