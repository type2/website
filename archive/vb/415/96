What did you think about the PPG vs. Dupont paints?

I chose single stage PPG for the bottom mouse grey. And dupont single stage
for top "pearl white"
painted it myself.  maaco prep is bad but may be ok for final coat.
very close to original.  I can tell you the paint codes and the paint stores
in watertown and waltham to go to.  You can maybe buy the paint and bring it
to maaco.
keep the original color!
