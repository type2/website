Hi Greg,
In our 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion and 63 SC, went from stock 1960-63 gearing, to FF with 3.875 R&P, retaining stock .82 fourth gear, and going with 1964-64 supension with later better brakes.? Adjusted 1-3 gearing to keep those in the 1,500 - 3,000 engine RPMs and fourth in 2,000 - 3,000 RPMs ending up at 58 MPH instead of 47 MPH stock tranny.

Just saying FF tranny has lots of versions.? From just putting in a higher geared fourth gear and accepting a huge gap between 3 & 4th gears, or even higher geared?R&P, and many other combinations.

If you or anyone else wants we will send our "Modified Tranny" info if sent a Pmail for it.

AA Transaxle up N. and a little E. of Seattle is a reputable shop.?
