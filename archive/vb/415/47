Subject: bus all apart & glass questions

Well I got everything out. It is pretty stripped down. I dropped it off with
my mechanic today.
He is going to start cutting out the rust section, and begin next stage of
prep before the body work. He said he'll call me when he has that done, so I
can come by and take a look. He just cleaned out a bay of his garages to
have some room for my bus.  

It is pretty exciting. I'll try to photo as much as possible.

I was hoping to replace the glass in my cranout windows with some type of
laminated or tempered glass with a tint. I don't need/want a heavy tint. I
just want to mostly block the UV rays, as my curtains got ruined pretty
quickly by the sun before, and that also wrecked part of the original
upholstery in the back. One guy I spoke with suggested the applied film, but
I don't like that idea, as I imagine it scratches easily. Anyone have
experience with the applied films? Or other suggestions? I think laminated
glass actually acts better for sound as well.
