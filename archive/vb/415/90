PG/SG isn't done justice in pictures.   In person, particularly a faded OG 
patina, it's amazing.

If you want to view color chips online:

http://www.tcpglobal.com/autocolorlibrary/

From this TCP can mix paint that's appropriate.  No personal experience 
with their paints, but I'll probably be shooting some of their AU 
(single stage acrylic urethane) on my 66 some day.   A bit cheaper than 
PPG Concept, and most long term reviews on Concept aren't all that hot 
anyway, so... ;)

The factor same paint codes on those color chips can be given to any paint 
supplier and they should be able to mix something up that's close (since 
you're not doing a factory PG/SG bus, nor trying to match OG paint, close 
enough is probably perfect..)

If you settle on a color, and want a specific formula, (ie, there are some 
spot on dove blue formulas available), do some searching on thesamba, 
you might find what you're looking for.

I tend to prefer OG colors on a stock, or near stock bus.  Though I'll 
admit that L87 is -boring- and I'd probably have to violate my stock nazi 
preferences and do something else.  Maybe dove blue. ;)


As for how to see colors?  Bus shows, campouts, and other gatherings. 
That's the best way.  Pictures, of course, are great, but you don't get 
the whole effect.

If you do want to do that, see if you can get a rattle can loaded from 
your paint supplier.  Most can do this now, and then you'll only have 
about $20 into the paint, but it will be mixed by the same guys who will 
mix your final color.   Otherwise, get the smallest amount you can, and 
paint it out either with a sprayer or brush....don't bother with the 
hardeners and "correct" reducers, that just adds money.   You can usually 
thin it with acetone or naptha for spraying the sample.  Your paint 
supplier might have some recommendations.

Personally I don't like a two stage (basecoat/clearcoat) finish on a bus. 
And maybe the clears hold up better, maybe they dont.  There are a LOT of 
factory cars with the clear peeling off...saw a 2004 VW with clear coming 
off the roof a few weeks ago.

A single stage is more "correct" even if the surface requires more 
maintenance and is more prone to dulling/chalking over time.


Go ahead and spend the few extra dollars on a urethane paint, though, 
instead of an enamel.   It's not a lot in the long run, and you'll have a 
longer lasting finish, IMO.

If you care about the finish, don't go this route.  EVERY person I've 
heard who is even remotely picky who has tried this ended up stripping it 
and respraying it.

It's just money (and paint) thrown down the drain.
