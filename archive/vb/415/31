which I really like.? (shameless blatant plug)
Greg sold a pair to a guy in europe who had bought some of the new WW repros and was not impressed with them.?? He did like?the ones Greg re-pinned.? Said they were better.?

 The church key turned easier and sweeter.? ?? It shuts easier too.??You can just push it gentley shut with?one finger.
?gee... maybe taking the droop out of the hinge made the lid line up the way it should.?
