I have used a plastic putty knife (hardware store) and solvent when I was
trying to clean up the sealing surface on a cast aluminum oil pan on a
F(-at-)rd without scratching it all up; it worked fairly well.  Pretty sure I
was using brake-clean type solvent and it didn't seem to "eat" the putty
knife.  If you aren't planning to repaint soon, you might skip the
solvent (or try a milder one) instead of the brake-clean.

Since the door gasket is kind of long and skinny, it might be hard to get
a full-width putty knife down in it.  You could trim one to size, or
maybe get a piece of round or square plastic rod and cut that down.

Going the other way, freezing the gasket with something like dry ice
might harden it even more and make it easier to chip off in big chunks.
Don't get frostbite...
