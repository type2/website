Subject: Re: [VB] paint colors & door panels

Generally I prefer the two tone upper/lower color look.?? I think the roof a different color doesn't look at clean.

Front door panels came with pockets until about April of 1961.? On all buses.? Often the original door panels are missing, though.

Here's an original on a 57 samba:

ones I made (using original pockets) as there weren't any in this 58 panel:

On a mid 64-67 the door pocket squashes aginast the door prop-open ?mechanism, but I had an og pocket panel on the drivers door of the 65 westy I used to have.? It was?very useful for maps etc.


Never had a problem with using the handle to pull the door closed.
One thing is when you pull the handle up it should open the door.? Does it work that way on your bus?
