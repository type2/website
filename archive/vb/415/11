Subject: Re: [VB] great stuff in door frames

Kevin, 

A few years ago I used a 6" wide peel and stick roof patch on the panels of a '63 DC to abate noise. It has layers of rubber and a thick flexible aluminam outer layer. Then I painted a water based Henry brand roof patch goop wherever I could reach, followed by silver bubble-wrap stuffed above the fiberboard headliner. Someone here said the bubble stuff broke down after a few years even though it looks like it was made for NASA. I believe it, but the bubble stuff could be easily replaced. I know there is house roof foil insulation that may hold up longer, being designed for long term use. The roofing materials probably won't break down due to heat, UV, ozone or purple haze. Avoid anything that allows condensation on bare metal that can drip into seams and low spots. Keep the window and door seals tight, park out of the elements, ventilate, dehumidify or move to a dry, warm place!
