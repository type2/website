Subject: What is the best way to remove old cargo door weather

Hi All,

Long time, no post, but  I do read!

I've just got new weather stripping for the cargo doors on my
'66 and wonder what tips and techniques anyone has for
removing the old weather stripping that isn't very soft anymore.
I did this on my old '59 panel and ended up chiseling it out with
a screw driver.  Is there an easier way?

Many Thanks,
