Yeah,
I'll second moving to a dry warm place.
Southern California's not bad. My bus is a garage queen on top of it.
The Kool Patch is a water based emulsion. I suppose that Henry's would have a
similar product.
Second Skin Audio has their Spectrum product designed for automotive use. Fire
retardant and all that, but very pricey in comparison to roofing products.

  Kevin,

  A few years ago I used a 6" wide peel and stick roof patch on the panels of
a '63 DC to abate noise. It has layers of rubber and a thick flexible aluminam
outer layer. Then I painted a water based Henry brand roof patch goop wherever
I could reach, followed by silver bubble-wrap stuffed above the fiberboard
headliner.  Someone here said the bubble stuff broke down after a few years
even though it looks like it was made for NASA. I believe it, but the bubble
stuff could be easily replaced. I know there is house roof foil insulation
that may hold up longer, being designed for long term use.  The roofing
materials probably won't break down due to heat, UV, ozone or purple haze.
Avoid anything that allows condensation on bare metal that can drip into seams
and low spots. Keep the window and door seals tight, park out of the elements,
ventilate, dehumidify or move to a dry, warm place!

   -Harry
