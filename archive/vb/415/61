I can echo E&B's comments on laminated.  The (replacement) laminated
front windshields on my '64 are going white around the edges from water
leaking into the laminations.  Laminated glass is a win for not creating
a zillion flying shards if you get into a wreck, but not so great at
lasting a long time.

The tint film stuff works if it is applied to *CLEAN* glass by somebody
that knows what they are doing.  Otherwise it bubbles up after a few
years and looks like crap.

You may have to shop around a little.  If there are any local chop-top
hot rod guys, talk to them; they have to be getting their glass from
somewhere.  You might also ask an RV shop; they are used to weird
windows that go on vehicles.  If you get really stuck, call the head
office of biggies like PPG or LOF (nee Libby-Owens-Ford; now possibly
part of Visteon) and ask for a local or regional distributor that will
do *custom* auto glass.
