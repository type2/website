Subject: re:odd oil leak

I had something like this happen to me. I didn't see anything spill over the
top, but I also never saw where the oil came from. I cleaned it up, let it
sit for a day or two, then checked the oil level, etc. And never had the
problem re-surface. I figured-based on list feedback, that oil somehow
overflowed, and I just didn't see it.
