Hi Kevin,
Not sure if your crank out windows are louvered or single pane.
?? Small panes of?louvers are much more breakable in laminate than larger window panes.
??The laminate is prone to delamination, plus?turning white?along the edges of the glass?when water gets past the seals.
? Tempered glass is?much stronger than laminate.
? Having a 62 Westie with all laminate front door windows from the factory can attest it was a bad idea.? In fifteen year of looking for laminate wing windows have not been able to find another that was not cracked, edge whiting,?or delaminating.
