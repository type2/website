Mark Dearing recommends the fan control switch from a Jetta or Rabbit.
He says the different positions of the fan supply different voltages
to the fan, one of them being 6 volt. If you want variable speed, this
sounds like a great way to go too.

 I also know that my windshield wiper does not work, or rather it works super
 fast-it is an original 6V, but I upgraded my bus to 12V. I know you can use
 a voltage drop, but I've heard they burn out over time.
