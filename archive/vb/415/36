If you stay with a stock engine, I would stay with a stock trans. If you 
upsize the engine, then consider a freeway flyer. I have a 1776 with a 3.88 
r&p. All else stock. Quite happy. Might have been even happier if I had done 
a stroker for a few more cc's. The 3.88 is only 6% higher than the stock 
4.12.
