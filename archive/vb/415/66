That is the type of handle I was thinking of installing. I think it would
look stock, and function well. I'll look at the pics from when I installed
something like that on my '69 truck. I can't recall exactly how they
installed. Somehow they need to look into the frame, and not just be
attached to the door panel.

And yes, my handle works that you pull it up/towards you/towards the back of
the bus to open. I have had my dad grab the handle, to pull the door shut,
and at the same tim the kind of pulls the handle backwards/upwards. This
then opens the door.

Thanks to all fur suggestions and comments. I think you are right, I don't
think I will go with painting the roof the same color as the bottom, and a
different color in the middle. I think I may go with the PG/SG combo. I have
been forwarded a few links with pics, and I really like the look. It is not
definite yet, but I think that is the way I am heading.

What about installing '66-67 style straps?  The later doors have
cutouts for nut plates and the screws replace a couple of the panel
clips just below the window (are the cutouts present in earlier doors,
too?) but it wouldn't be too difficult to make it work without the nut
plates.
