Subject: Type-1 Engine Head Nuts, Drilling Out Studs, and Ithaca, NY

Volks,

I was assembling a long-ignored type-1 engine longblock this weekend and 
realized that: 
    (a) I didn't have all the head nuts I needed to bolt the head on.
    (b) the head nuts on this case were different than other cases i had around.

This case looks to be a universal case (says made in mexico) and has thinner
diameter head studs than the older cases I have lying around.  The nuts
I found still require an 15mm wrench but have a smaller inner diameter thread.

Any thoughts on what nuts I'm looking for so I can buy replacements?  Searching
the archive didn't yield much.

Also, I need some advice on drilling out bolts/etc.  Long story short, one of my
rebuilt heads had the valve cover gasket spring latch (i.e. wire thingy that holds
the cover in place) broken off into the head.  So I'll need to drill it out before
using the head, but my existing zirconium coated bits aren't cutting it.  The
intarwebs point to cobalt bits as the way to go...any thoughts on this?

Thanks!
    Avocado Tom

p.s. headed to Ithaca in the '67 this weekend.  Tips on neat destinations or 
drives welcome!  And honk if you see a white splitty with PA plates...
