Subject: Buses n Boats campout final update (ohio)

Good morning all! I just wanted to check in with one last update before the event this weekend.
I just got back from the campground and everything looks great! River levels are perfect so canoeing should be no problem this year (barring monsoon rains between now and then).

Reminders:

*Camping fees are $10 per adult per night.  Kids 17 & under are FREE with paying adult.

*You will register and pay for camping with me AT THE CAMPSITE (not at the canoe rental office) I can take CASH or CHECK but no credit cards for camping fees.

*Canoe trip fees are $13 per person (based on 2 people in a canoe) and includes all equipment rental and transportation.  These fees will be paid to the CANOE RENTAL OFFICE (not me) on Saturday morning before the trip.

*We will meet at the Picnic Shelter in the Campground area at 10:30 am on Saturday morning for the canoe trip.  At which time we will proceed to walk over to the Canoe rental office for an 11:00 am departure time.

*Saturday evening we will have the community Cincinnati-style dinner at the Picnic Shelter in the camping area at approximately 6:00 pm.  I will be providing the Chili, so feel free to bring something to compliment it. Suggestions are: Pasta, Shredded cheese, hot dogs, buns, or another side dish.

*Firewood will be delivered sometime on Thursday afternoon (I am buying it from a different source this year, not the campground guy.) So you early bird arrivals (Randy & ??) may have to scavenge for wood if you want a fire on Wednesday night.

* 50\50 Split the pot raffle drawing tickets will be on sale up until dinner on Saturday night. The drawing will be held immediately following dinner and HALF of the $$pot$$ will go to the drawing winner, and the other HALF will help to off-set the expense of buying the firewood.

*Follow signs back to the camping area. The camping area is a privately-owned facility, so we don't have to worry about being hassled by Park rangers and open display of alcohol is permitted so there is no need for the "red cup" policy...HOWEVER, please keep it all in good taste and remember to cbe ourteous to others in the campground. ALWAYS REMEMBER, THIS IS A FAMILY-ORIENTED EVENT, as are all OVT events, so there is really just ONE SIMPLE RULE:  Don't be a dick!!

*MOST IMPORTANTLY, DRIVE SAFE AND GET HERE IN-TACT!!!!
