Hi Tom,
Sounds like you have the thinner DP studs.? Remove one of the nuts you do have and take it down to a local fastener store for comparision.? When you find a bolt in the store that fits you now know the thread size of the nut.? Make sure to get a 10.8 metric hardness of nut.
? Cobalt drill might do the job.? Slower RPM and some oil will go along way to keeping the drill cutting if it can and not getting burnt.
Think you mean the valve cover retaining spring.
