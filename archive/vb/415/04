Subject: Re: [VB] Odd oil leak

Good thought, however the oil  was clearly not coming out the draft tube. I 
think it just poured down over the internals and with the volume a little 
went over the crank and flowed back past the slinger.  Never seen this 
before in 37 years of changing oil on my bus.
