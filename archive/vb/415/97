What did you think about the PPG vs. Dupont paints?

Honestly, there wasn't any appreciable difference in my view. The PPG had a weird "smell" even with the respirator. My friend who has painted many cars insists that the dupont is better, but he only buys dupont paint. The color match was good in both cases. I used the PPG codes for matching. I can get you the dupont codes if you like. Paint wasn't cheap even buying the "cheap" stuff. PPG was a bit more watery. 

The ppg brand was "Omni" 
The dupont I don't remember just ask for the single stage arcylic. 

if you guys do a good prep job ( which I'm sure you will ) it will look awesome. That bus was in really good shape to start with in comparision to many.
