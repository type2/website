Subject: RE: [VB] great stuff in door frames

Yeah I read this website, and have been re-reading it every year or so, when
I think about doing some insulation on my bus. Finally I am getting to it. I
did not like the idea of fiberglass insulation, and only planned on putting
the great-stuff in areas that were inaccessible to any other types of
insulation. As he suggests-make sure no water needs to flow through an area
that you put this insulation. 

Do you have any alternative suggestions for insulation in the bus? I have
thought about that stuff that looks like bubble wrap, but is silver colored.
Supposed to help with insulating. Otherwise...I'm about to do a project
using icynene(which is similar to Great Stuff) but used for insulating whole
homes. I might ask those guys if they have ever done a vehicle.

I notice the guy who made these pages suggests spraying all seams with 3m
Rust Preventative. I should do something like this as well, although not
sure of the product yet.

He also used Kool Patch painted onto the interior of the van, I was planning
on just using Damplifier on the interior metal, then in select spots some
Luxury Liner, or maybe some foam. I like the idea of insulation in there,
but can't imagine really sealing the insulation precisely so that no
moisture gets in there. I want moisture to be able to get out as easily as
in. Then again-sound proofing is a higher priority than keeping it
insulated. Although insulating is still something I'd like to do.

Can you explain/show pics of what you mean by sealing gaps on cargo door
hinges?

Kevin,

Did you read Heat, Rust, & Noise in VW's:
http://www.shagadelic.org/VW/info/gmbulley-soundproof/index.html

I would go with filling only the ribs as shown on the Interior Out, Noise 
Proofing page
http://www.shagadelic.org/VW/info/gmbulley-soundproof/intrir1.html

Watch out for other areas. Water does need to be able to flow out the 
bottoms.

I sealed up the gaps on the cargo door hinges to minimize water entry. I 
used some 50 year rubbery stuff from the Depot and then painted it to match.

At some point I will do the front doors hinges too. For now, each time I 
wash the bus, water pours out from the bottoms of the front doors.
