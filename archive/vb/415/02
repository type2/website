Subject: great stuff in door frames

So I now have everything stripped out. I'm bringing it by my mechanics shop
to begin/determine the amount of body work to have done. I noticed on one of
the soundproofing links, the idea of spraying some type of expanding foam
into any channels in the frame of the bus. I know there are certain areas
you are not supposed to do this-because you want water to flow through the
doors-etc. Has anyone on the list done this, have any recommendations for or
against? I wa thinking-as long as no water is flowing through the area, and
if I can't actually get any thing else up there-as far as soundproofing,
putting the foam should not hurt, I imagine it can only help. Right?

I've looked into the butyl tape for the windows when I re-install-thanks for
that tip E & B.
