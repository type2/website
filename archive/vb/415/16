Subject: RE: [VB] great stuff in door frames

I think we had the same type of camper. I have an ez-camper. I also had foam
just glued in for sound and maybe insulating properties. It worked ok I
guess, for technology that is over 40 years old. I did not notice any
moisture/rot issues anywhere due to the foam trapping moisture-except at the
floor, where water had been leaking in windows, down the inside wall, and it
got trapped at the bottom of the wall by the foam.  I look at this as a
problem with the window and not the foam. Then again, my windows never
really sealed super well, so I'm sure some moisture was coming and going
through these. Now that I plan on sealing the windows properly, this may
trap more moisture in the bus.

 

I will probably stick with some sort of bubble wrap. I plan on adding the
sound damping stuff, then driving around a bit, soaking the bus with a hose-
etc. to try to find any water leaks, or noise spots, before I put in any
panels.

I had this camper bus that the wooden panels had been removed from, and just
had foam glued to the walls and ceiling .   I guess it was a
insulation/sound deadening.   One day in winter I was getting something out
of the back of the bus, and I touched the foam , it was completely soggy.
ick!

The thing is, if you live in a damp climate, water will get it the bus.   If
you drive in the rain, water will get in.
If you breath in the bus, water will get in.   If you camp in the bus, and
engage in activities where you and your mate may have heavy breathing, water
will be there.

Fibreglass is not so great. as it'll be a soggy water retentive mess.

I used the foil bubble wrap in the camper when I replaced the interior
panels.   It was a hot sunny day when the ceiling panels went in... even
before the panels were in there, just getting the bubble wrap up made a huge
difference in heat in the bus (not baking anymore).

ps,  the telling point with rust and insulation is how does it hold up years
later

Yeah I read this website, and have been re-reading it every year or so, when
I think about doing some insulation on my bus. Finally I am getting to it. I
did not like the idea of fiberglass insulation, and only planned on putting
the great-stuff in areas that were inaccessible to any other types of
insulation. As he suggests-make sure no water needs to flow through an area
that you put this insulation.
