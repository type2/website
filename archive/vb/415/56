Subject: paint colors & door panels

I noticed on one of the pics a bus with its' roof painted the same color as
the lower body, but they used a greenish color for the middle. It is a
splittie with a sun roof. It looks French, well the words on the page are
French - "Pour le grand tourisme" L'autobus VW.

Anyone ever seen this in real life? Any comments on look...

I just noticed on a '57 bus for sale on the samba, looks like it has the
color combo I was looking to do. I also noticed the inside of the bus is all
painted the bottom color, so the top color only exists outside the bus. Am I
witnessing this correctly, is this how it was always done?

I also noticed on this bus, the front door panels have a little pocket cut
into them. The owner claims everything is original, but I've never seen a
pocket cut into a door panel before(as original). I had thought about doing
that myself, for either speakers or just to hold stuff. Anyone have better
pics of an original pocket in a door panel, or advice on putting speakers in
the door? I have put speakers into my '69 singlecab door panels. I was
thinking it would be similar.

I was also thinking about putting door handles on my front doors, so
passengers are not always grabbing the opening handle to close the door.
Sometimes my Dad would grab that incorrectly, and never be able to shut the
door-he kept pulling it shut, then opening it at the same time. It was funny
once, then sort of a pain, then I just had to open and shut the door for
him, and tell him repeatedly not to touch that handle while I was driving! I
guess he probably had to do something similar with me when I was little.
