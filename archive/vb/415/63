You can also make a "cleaner" by hacksawing or Dremel-ing a couple of
slots into an old bolt (or a new one) with the same diameter and thread
pitch.  This *will not* cut threads in an unthreaded hole like a tap
will, but it will clean out an existing hole without cutting much, if
any, extra metal out.

You can also get a battery terminal brush that looks kind of like a
steel lipstick case.  The bottom side has a hole for doing the battery
posts, and if you take off the top cover, there is a little fir-tree
brush in there for doing the cable terminals.  The fir-tree brush also
does a decent job on cleaning out threaded holes, as long as the hole
is big enough to get the brush into.

Also, older Buses had a tab washer under the RGB bolts; you bent up an
ear of the tab after the bolts were tight - kinda like the front wheel
bearing lock plate.  I'm pretty sure that these were discontinued in
the late splitty era and that there is an admonishment in the Bentley
to not use them, even on earlier Buses.
