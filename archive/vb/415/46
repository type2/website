I remember seeing this great image of a bus camping, with a family. The bus
was painted green and an off white. I can't remember exactly. Any ideas
where to search for images like this? I thought I saved the image when I saw
it, but can't find it now. Now that I am painting my bus soon, I remember I
really liked that color combination, I want to see it again, to see if I
still like it, and also to be able to get the paint colors, or get some
ideas.

I know my description is pretty vague.but any ideas appreciated..
