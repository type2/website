Expanding sprayfoam is evil and makes more rust.? 
I really do not think it is a good thing.
I have seen rust from it.
I recomment staying away from the sprayfoam.

I noticed on one of
the soundproofing links, the idea of spraying some type of expanding foam
into any channels in the frame of the bus. I know there are certain areas
you are not supposed to do this-because you want water to flow through the
doors-etc. Has anyone on the list done this, have any recommendations for or
against?
