Subject: Re: [VB] windows & paint....

For my jelousie windows, I bead blasted and then painted with aluminum paint 
(rattle can rustoleum) and the overcoated with some UV resistant clear. 
Looks like  a nice anodize job. I installed new tempered glass from my local 
glass shop all around. I get a lot of compliments.

The bead blasting easily took off all the corrosion and left a nice surface 
finish.
