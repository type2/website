I put a later big nut setup in my '57 and it was an easy job - needed an adapter, but you won't.  I wanted of course to go a little faster so I looked through the manuals and worked out that in fact a 1200 transmission with later big nut RGB's would in fact give you the tallest final drive ratio - even more then the 1500 12V stock setup of a 66/67.

I put it all togther with no problems (later RGB's and earlier box) and can now cruise at 60mph for a touch over 3000 rpms.  The point is that apart from the whine of the RGB's (which I kind of like) you can get a flyer setup which looks stock.  If you're happy to lower or chop then go for straight axle or IRS with something like a KG 1500 transmission (<b
