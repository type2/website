Hi Tom,
If it is one of the springs broken off in there it probably is hardened steel due to the tempering process used in making it a spring, and not readally drillable.? You might have to measure one of the other holes for depth.? Then drill into the side of the casting to get into the bottom of the offending?hole and use something to push the spring remains out.? Might even be able to use a piece of coat hanger wire bent just right.
