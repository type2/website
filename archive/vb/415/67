Subject: About a month to go...

Hi all,

Okay, it's about a month until departure for 17 days in "Vintage VW heaven"
over in Europe.  The first weekend I'll attend the huge VW Vintage Treffen in
th quaint old village of Hessisch - Oldendorf, not too far from Hannover (Type
2 factory is there).  If you want to see the rare old VWs that are pre-paid
and pre-registered for the show (completely sold out now since Nov 2008!) go
to the following address:

and check out the column listing the year and model of VW as well as the
country they'll be coming from.  My H/O "ride" is listed as #160 of the group
from the BBT business in Belgium.  It's a fully restored 1965 Singl-Cab
factory equipped "ladder truck".  That should be a handful out on the Autobahn
at speed!  I hope nobody stops in front of me fast, cause I'll shoot a 35 foot
extension ladder up their ass!

The following weekend we'll be attending the "European Bug-In #3" just a few
kilometers from the French border in Southern Belgium.  I haven't been
assigned a vehicle for that one yet, but have been told by Bob, the BBT owner
to expect a BIG surprise, not sure what that means!

Anyway, enjoy the H/O web site and the list.  Check out the European Bug-In
site too at http://www.europeanbugin.com/EBugIn.php?lang=EN.

Wooooo Hoooooo!  Belgian beers and Buses, here I come!
