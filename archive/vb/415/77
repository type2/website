Subject: Re: [VB] valve adjustment frequency

Hi Tom,
Kinda of depends!? If you are a lead foot and find the valves stretching dangerously close to getting burnt due to too tight, then you need to adjust more often.
??? Have done it every 1,500 miles or 3,000 miles depending on the VW, the drive, and how much it depends on getting home from how far away.
