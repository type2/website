Hi Greg,
	You might be happy with a stock large nut transaxle?  Especially if  
you are running a mild 1600.  I have two splitties with large nuts  
and I actually like the one with the 4.35-1 ring and pinion over the  
4.12-1.  Both of these buses have single port engines and I might  
feel different with a dual port?
