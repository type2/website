Subject: Re: [VB] re"valve adjustment frequency

I check the valves on my air cooled VWs about every 3,000 miles or at  
oil change.  I usually don't have to do anything more than check the  
clearances since they seem to rarely change.  I have a dp1600 in a  
'74 that hasn't needed adjusting for years.  Gary Gibson
