I had this camper bus that the wooden panels had been removed from, and just had foam glued to the walls and ceiling .?? I guess it was a insulation/sound deadening.?? One day in winter I was getting something out of the back of the bus, and I touched the foam , it was completely soggy.?? ick!

The thing is, if you live in a damp climate, water will get it the bus.?? If you drive in the rain, water will get in.
If you breath in the bus, water will get in.?? If you camp in the bus, and engage in activities where you and your mate may have heavy breathing, water will be there.

Fibreglass is not so great. as it'll be a soggy water retentive mess.

I used the foil bubble wrap in the camper when I replaced the interior panels.?? It was a hot sunny day when the ceiling panels went in... even before the panels were in there, just getting the bubble wrap up made a huge difference in heat in the bus (not baking anymore).

ps,? the telling point with rust and insulation is how does it hold up years later

Yeah I read this website, and have been re-reading it every year or so, when
I think about doing some insulation on my bus. Finally I am getting to it. I
did not like the idea of fiberglass insulation, and only planned on putting
the great-stuff in areas that were inaccessible to any other types of
insulation. As he suggests-make sure no water needs to flow through an area
that you put this insulation.
