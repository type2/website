Subject: motor blows black smoke.....not anymore!!!!!

Many thanks to all especially E&B. Bus is fixed!!! I swapped carbs and fixed
the black smoke problem and after a very short look around I seen a screw
jammed between the engine tin which was rubbing on the crank pulley. shut
motor off, removed screw and noise gone. I feel like an idiot but after seeing
that black smoke i figured i ruined the motor. Again thanks to all for input
problem solved.
