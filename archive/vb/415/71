If you like good beer, then you need to visit the Ithaca Beer Company. 
They're on Hwy 13 on the right headed south. They're about the last 
building on the right as you leave town. I think the road goes from 4 
lanes to 2 lane right where they are. They're easy to spot.

You can taste most of their beers for free. They're all for sale right 
there too. You'll probably want to buy some after you taste it. I think 
they make some of the best beer you can find anywhere.

Lots of good places to eat around the Commons in downtown Ithaca.

The farmer's market on the north side of town is cool too, if it's going 
on. Lots of good homemade pies and stuff like that for sale.
