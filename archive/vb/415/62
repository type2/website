My '64 came to me with pull handles installed on both front doors.  They
are folding handles, kind of like a (house) door hinge; a tab attaches
to the door metal with sheet metal screws, and a spring keeps the chromed
handle part folded flat against the door when not in use.  They are just
about centered on the door front-to-back, or maybe just a little further
towards the back.  I don't think these are original VW, but an accessory
someone added in the 1960s or 1970s.

If you don't mind possibly bumping into them or getting beat up on them
in a wreck, you might install a round cabinet knob (like you might have
in your kitchen).  These take (I think) a single 8-32 screw to mount
and you need access to the back to put the screw in; OK if you have your
whole door torn apart but not so great otherwise.  If you get a wood one
you can paint or stain it to match your interior.  If you go this route,
use a washer under the screw head and probably Loctite on the screw to
keep it from unscrewing as people twist the knob as they grasp it.

If you don't like what's at the hardware store, Southco
http://www.southco.com/ sells all kinds of nifty knobs and handles and
things; mostly they get used on electronic enclosures and control panels
but you can use them wherever.

Standard disclaimers apply; I don't get money or other consideration
from any companies mentioned.
