Subject: RE: Vintage VW Luggage

Yes--VW luggage was available to VW owners in the 50s and perhaps as late as
the 60s--Each piece was designed for a specific area in the VW Bug--Behind
the back seat--under the front bonnet, etc.--At the last Bad Camberg show
there was an NOS set for sale that I took a video of--Have no idea if you
can read the manufacturer's name, in the video?.  Again there "May" have
been more then one, manufacturer, as the VW had more accessories made for
it, then any car.--It was Not "Samsonite" as so often this is sold,as VW
Luggage, due to the angle of some Samsonite luggage pieces--The NOS set,
still in Plastic at Bad Camberg "I Think"? had a price of $1800-- and it was
still there at the end of the day--, uj

PS: But, VW Bus people due to the size of their vehicle, were able as always
to
put just about anything and everything into and on top of their
Splittie--guess that's why we choose this VW.
