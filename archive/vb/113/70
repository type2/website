I have a new cassette radio from radio shack ($59) that fits the holes in my
dash without cutting and the original knobs fit. The "plastic itself is
discolored, so cleaning won't work.

doing your dishes?? fwiw i believe there are nos radio knobs kicking around-
what kind of radio do you have?

Now that I have my rare original radio knobs for my '63, I need to paint
them. They are badly discolored and stained. I know that the wrong paint
will desolve the wierd protoplastic, so my question is...what kind of paint
should I use to make  them white?
