Subject: VW LT sighting in Phoenix

Does anyone know of a VW LT seen in Phoenix, AZ Saturday, 04/27/02.
Yellowish drab color, like a cross between the baywindow butterscotch color and
the puke yellow etching primer. Was heading South on I-17 about Thunderbird Rd.
10:30am.
Does it belong to anyone on the lists? Wondered if it was the underpriced
camper as sold on eBay recently. Sweet! 
If it was/is yours, then I was THAT one guy in a dirty black miscellaneous,
blending in to the crowd, F150 going the other direction about 3 lanes over at
75mph. ;-)

(oh yeah, that guy!)
