Subject: RE: [VB] Run the thermostat or not?

Thermostat and flaps, don't leave home without them. I always search the
wrecking yards and various places for brackets, flaps, push bars, and
attachment hardware. I get a lot of engines with all of this removed and if
it's going back in stock, I always insist on replacing everything for the
cooling that was missing. The thermostats are only $4 mail order, cheap for
the life you add to your motor.

Hi Dan,
Install a thermostat if carburetored.  If you have the complete engine with 
Mexi FI which helps control oil temp via leaning out the fuel mixture and 
sensing this with temp sensors.  Plus as you say much of Mexico does not get

as cold as the USA does.  Also the flaps help to aim cooling air to the 
proper places and if you ever leave you state and end up in weather lower 
than 70F the thermostat will help keep your engine happy and keep you warmer

with more heat exchanger output.  Especially since you Floridians tend to 
freeze once the outside temps drop below 70F!  ;-)
