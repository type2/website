> Dave & I were discussing the chances of a bullet-signalled high-roof
> being an OG factory item yesterday and didn't really come to a
> conclusion. With that in mind, I wanted to pose the following questions
> to our esteemed listees:
> 
> 1) What year was the factory high-roof first available?
> 2) What is the M-Code for this package?
> 3) Were many ambulances done in a high-roof package?
> 4) Were the windows in a high-roof normally positioned against the
> belt-line or the roof? (They were welded over on this one.)
> 5) How hard is it to find ambulance innards? (Besides "Very VERY".)
> 
> Thanks for any info,
