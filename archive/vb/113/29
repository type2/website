Hey S,

I tried a POR Substitute that a friend recommended from Home depot.  It's
called Hammertite or something real close to that, and the stuff wasn't
nearly as nice a finish when it dried.  It also had some type of metal fleck
to it so that it wasn't really black.  I've since gone back to POR for the
important stuff and trying to use up the Hammertite on things that I want
protected but am not really worried about.

POR for me.
