Subject: Sat/ sighting/ Sandy, Oregon

I had to take a trip into the city this past Sat.

It's snowing slightly as I approach Government Camp

& head down the west side of Mt. Hood. About 30 mi
west 

is Sandy Or. There's a newer "Chev" dealer there & 

a car show is under way, took a quick look & didn't
see any 

of our fav ride's, but when I came through a couple 

hours later there was a very clean 63-65 blue crewcab

it was on the street, so don,t know if it got in the

show.

Any one from the list?

Also talked to the driver of a 66 org westie parked in

the Winco lot in Gresham. Spring in the NW brings out 

those hidden gem's from there winter hibernation.
