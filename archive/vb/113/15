I know that VW had accessory luggage that they put in bugs in the 50s and
60s behind the rear seat and under the hood, I dont know who made it and
have never seen any in person. I have only seen it in brochures and on
websites, I wonder if they offered it for busses? Anybody know?

Isn't the idea behind some of these things to have what would have been
current for the period?  Not everyone would have VW Luggage :).  Is
there such a thing?

Yea, it's not in anything i've ever seen, but it's a very cool, old
german juicer, just like the non vw luggage you see at shows on peoples
luggage racks.
