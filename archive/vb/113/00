Subject: Westy tow hitch electrical wiring.  Any original installs????

Anyone out there have an original install of a Westy
tow hitch electrical hook-up?  I am trying to figure
out exactly were Westfalia ties in the electical to
the bus and how they routed it.  

My most current info says it went thru the engine
compartment somewhere but how?????  Where did it
enter?  How were the wires spliced?????

Thanks
Matt
