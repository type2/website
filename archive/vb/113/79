My '64 has a non-original rubber hose from the air cleaner to the elbow
on top of the carb.  It looks to me like a piece of really big water-cooled
radiator hose.  You might try your FLAPS, or possibly the local semi-truck 
garage, to see if they have hose in that size.

You might also look into heat riser hose at the FLAPS.  Older water-cooled
cars had a hose going from the bottom of the air cleaner snorkel to a
stove on the exhaust manifold and some of these hoses were fairly large.
You can buy generic replacements by length and diameter.  Just make sure
the hose is fairly rigid; in the original application it only had to deal
with tiny pressure differences but on your VW it will have all the intake
air sucking through it.

If you can figure out some way to seal the ends, you might be able to
use some 2" PVC pipe from the hardware store.   The problem is that
you can't run just the hard plastic pipe, because the engine can move
independently of the air cleaner.  If the hose you have is well and
truly thrashed, you may be able to cut off the ends and use them on
the ends of the PVC pipe to provide a little flexibility. 

If the hose you has just a small crack, a little silicone sealer might
keep you going until you find a replacement.

Good luck!
