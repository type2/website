Subject: RE: [VB] Detergent oil, new engine?, When?

Sludging will also occur in our air cooled engines if the case is not vented properly to a sufficent vacum source.Keep the road draft tube clean and with the proper boot installed.

Another cause of sludging is extended service intervals.Change the oil at 4000 miles max,new vehicles can sometimes get away with longer service intervals but the oil in these engines is not subject to the same enviornment as in an air cooled motor.

Hi Al,
We used detergent oil from the get go!  The detergent only helps keeps the 
engine case inside clean from carbon build up and sludge by keeping it 
suspended in the oil.  In the olden days (1930s or earlier?) automobile 
owners had to dissassemble thier engines about every 30,000 miles to decoke 
(Clean out all the carbon!) the engine.
