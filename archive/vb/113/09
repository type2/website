Subject: VDO gauge mount

A happy discovery I thought I would share:
VDO makes a rubber under-dash mount for two small gauges (part # V240-803 on the
receipt, $18). The mount attaches from beneath with two screws, the spacing
between them is very very close to the spacing between the two little M5x0.8
machine screws that hold the lighting switch and the hazard lights switch onto
the underside of the dash. I replaced the screws with longer ones running
through the rubber gauge mount, now I have two gauges nicely placed with no
drilling, no hassle.
