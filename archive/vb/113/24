Keep in mind that a 67 has a different sized dash opening for the radio.

I've noticed that many retailers/sellers on Ebay state that their products,
(not only radios either) will fit up until 67, which was the last year of
the split window bus.

There were many one-year only features on the 67 model.  Keep this in mind
when purchasing master cylinders, door handles and locks, radios, and lots
of other parts as well.

Doesn't matter how good a deal you get on a part if it won't fit.
