Subject: Trip Report 2002 Bug-In Ennis, TX

Just got back from the 2002 Bug-In at Ennis, TX. For once the weather 
was nice...no April showers!!!

Lots of nice cars. Not enough old busses for me. New Beetles seem to 
be really increasing at shows I noticed. Still, lots of nice cars new 
and old.

Swap meet was great. Lots of cool stuff around. Many good prices, may 
that were way too high. It's always that way I guess. I snagged a new 
unused set of balljoint dropped spindles and all the bearings for the 
front for my wife's 'vert....cost me only $75!!!! Also got a set of 
1959 Texas Truck license plates for my '59 Single Cab, a new German 
bus muffler, an early bus apron, and (1) one dollar wheel adapter to 
match one I've had sitting in a box in the garage for a 
while.....gonna use the pair on my trike someday.

Met up with a lot of VW guys from around Texas. Chris La Fon, Jim 
Share, Travis, Raoul, Aaron, and a few other San Angelo guys who made 
the drive.

My 5 yr. old son liked the drag racing the best. One of the cars set 
the world record at 6.2 something and 202 miles an hour on his run. 
Pretty amazing for a VW engine.

Anyway, I took lots of pictures. They're all up here:
