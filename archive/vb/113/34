Well, they don't call it a "blackbody" for nothing!

For objects that are hotter than their environment, a black color does
indeed radiate more heat than a lighter shade.

Most heat from a VW engine is transferred by forced convection, but
a significant amount is radiated.  You won't fix an overheating problem by
painting the engine black but it is probably worth a degree or two.

Absorbtion of heat from a light source is the opposite of radiative heat
transfer.  The only difference is that the radiation being emitted is in
the IR frequency range rather than the visible range.
