If you need a modern radio there was a thread a while back about a Radio

I've got one of those.  Fits great and with no mods.  Cost all of 20 bucks.
 Works about like you'd expect a twenty dollar radio to work.  You need a
good antenna maybe a booster.  The stations don't seem to lock that well as
its not a digital tuner.  Output power is very low too, but when you're
just running a stock speaker up under the dash you don't need much.  That
said, all busses are noisy.  If doing it again I spend for a better tuner
and more power so I could hear it with out distortion.

But hey it was only 20 bucks!
