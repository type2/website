Hi John,
I just put a Vacuum Advance Dizzy in my bus this past weekend, and also
rebuilt my 30 PICT2 carb.

This distributor is a 205T, from a 1970 manual trans vw.  The 30 PICT2 is
what came originally on my 1600 SP.

I noticed a real difference in running through the gears.  No hesitation
like I felt with my old 009.  I also was running a 30/31 Brosol Carb, which
was pure junk.  I rebuilt the carb using all stock jets.  It was my first
carb rebuild, and I'm happy to say that there are no leaks.

It will take me a while to determine if my gas mileage has changed.  I was
getting a very disappointing 16-17 mpg, so it shouldn't take much to improve
that.

So far, I'm REALLY glad I did this changeover.  I have 5 busses/bugs at
home, all with 009's.  I'm so used to them and the way they run that it took
changing over to a VA dizzy to understand what everyone meant about
hesitation.

Good luck,
Ed

PS-I got my Safari Windows from Creative Enterprises in England, and I'm
really happy with them.  They have really good strong latches.  Ronnie at
Oldvolks sells these Safari kits as well, and I'm sure he can advise you as
to what the latches are made of, and the overall quality of them.

Take care,
Ed
