I got there late 11:30, and was surprised how few busses were in the show.
There were many more, and in some cases, better busses in the parking lot.
The swap area was good. I got a $2 horn button and a pair of original radio
knobs. After seeing them for sale on the Net for $35 a apir I found a guy at
the show that had ONE for $25, then I found a pair for $10, but then found a
pair in a box of window cranks for a buck.

Among the regulars I missed seeing was Paul Taylor and his SC. I was looking
to meet other listers at his truck at noon, oh well. Since he recently
cancelled his Oktoberbus event, I'm a little worried. I hope he is OK.

Oh yeah, in the swap area I also bought a maroon metalflake Ghia Vert in
incredibally good condition. A virtual driveaway. Her name is Ruby.
