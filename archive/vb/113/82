Subject: Re: [VB] Detergent oil, new engine?, When?

I use nondetergent to help seat the rings. I try and run 1500-2000 miles
before switching to detergent.
I've had trouble seating rings using things like castrol.  The down side
of using non-detergent oil in break-in is that it doesn't have all those
good things in it that might help protect the cam.
Also if you decide to run synthetic make sure the rings are really done
seating. Redline recommends 10,000 miles before switching I think, but VW
rings seat faster being fairly soft.  I'd say wait 2000 before synthetic
but somebody might have other ideas.
I tried Redline this winter in my 2L engine and was very happy with the
performance.  Due to cost I wouldn't use it in normal VW engines.
