Hey Jon,

The sad note to that one 5mm bolt is that after I cleaned it up, I found out
that it was a "Knipping" and not a "Kamax".  But at least I can use the nut.
The search continues!!!

>>Plus his "big" score was 1 5mm bolt and nut for the rear bumper splash pan
to bumper bracket. It was almost too much fun to watch when he asked the
(obviously) unknowing lady at the swap space if he could "just buy the bolt"
off the splash pan. Ah, cheap entertainment!
