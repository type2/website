Subject: Re: [VB] checking out a far away bus

Hello,

First , have the owner take massive amounts of pictures of the bus. Detailed
pics. Pics of the sheet metal from the side ,the rockers from both sides ,
all the floors from the top and bottom, the window sills on all windows,
around all the door and hatch rubber. Pics of the rain channel, the motor
compartment , teh battery area, the rear corners from the inside,  the nose
from the inside.
ask about who has done the work on it, ask for contact info,
 Find a reputable and or knowledgable person with a club or organisation to
go and look at it for you, of course make it worh their while.
If you win the bid, of course you can back out when you get there. This may
not seem like a good idea now but if the bus is misrepresented(Im not saying
it is) for that kind of cash then oh well.
 For the price the owner is asking , they should be willing to do all this
for a serious buyer. It looks like a nice bus and would be a nice find but
only if it is as nice as they say.
