I just saw this and was looking into doing it on my 59 single.
http://home.earthlink.net/~tonykirk/_uimages/cFront20Trans20Mount.JPG  But I want to do a little research on it.

This comes from this page on a 57 single. http://home.earthlink.net/~tonykirk/

I built a spacer that effectivly lengthens the rear housings on the cables.It mounts between the cable housing and fixed tube on the body.I am also looking at shortening a pair by installing new threaded portions at the front,a friend has a Hy-Press crimper and various ends for making sailboat rigging.

Hello fellow bus people, I am putting a '67 tranny into my '59 crew cab next
spring.  The problem is the crew cab
has a split case tranny that mounts differently than the later tranny.  I
have tried a little u-shaped adaptor on my 
'58 panel but did not like the way it fit up.  Does anyone know of a better
adaptor to use.  Any advice is always
appreciated.  thank you
