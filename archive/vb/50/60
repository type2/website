Subject: How Much Grease?

Hi.  I was doing some regular maintenance on my 1959
bus yesterday, and as I was greasing all the fittings,
I realized there is a fitting on each of the emergency
brake cables in the rear, right where the cable comes
out of the metal tube in the body.  How much grease
should I pump in there?  I don't want to pump too much
in and get grease all over my brakes.  Is there
something inside that cable housing that stops grease
from going into the brakes?  Any advice appreciated.
Thanks.
