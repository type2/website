I had a bug muffler on my '71 for quite a while.  Everything fit, even
with larger-than-stock peashooters on it.  Switched to a real bus muffler
when I swapped engines.  I doubt that the '71 is much different from a '69
in this respect.

The reason I went to a bus muffler.  Never had any fumes, but always
though about it.
