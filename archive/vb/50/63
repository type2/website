Hello fellow bus people, I am putting a '67 tranny into my '59 crew cab next
spring.  The problem is the crew cab
has a split case tranny that mounts differently than the later tranny.  I
have tried a little u-shaped adaptor on my 
'58 panel but did not like the way it fit up.  Does anyone know of a better
adaptor to use.  Any advice is always
appreciated.  thank you
