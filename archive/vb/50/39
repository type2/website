The trailer that UHAUL rents and which I am planning
on using 
(their AT trailer) is 14' long dual axle which I hope
is long enough- has 
someone actually used a UHAUL AT (Auto Transport)
trailer and can vouch 
that the bus will actually fir on the trailer?

Back in 1988 when I bought my 65 doublecab sight
unseen,  it was in Pueblo, Colorado, and I live in
Wisconsin.  I planned to tow it home, so I  borrowed
my father-in-law's 1978 ford 3/4 ton  pickup, 300ci
six with a 4 speed, with a cab-over camper on it, and
headed out with my wife and 3 small sons.  When we
bought it, we decided to rent the U-Haul trailer
("Adventure in Moving", right?) and had no problems
with it.  Truck had enough power, it trailered fine,
and the double cab is still part of the family (since
joined by a 75 bus to replace the old 68 and 72 buses
that had seen too many Wis winters).
The bus fit fine on the trailer that they had then--I
think it even had a winch to helpus pull the truck up
on the trailer.
Good luck.

Jim (still in Wis)
