Subject: need a ride from Phoenix to BBB VI

to AZ listmembers,
i am seriously planning on flying down from
minneapolis for BBB VI. i found some cheap plane
tickets online and if i can work it out, i'd be
arriving in Phoenix on the 16th sometime mid-day. if
you have more than one bus you want to bring, i'd love
to drive it down/sleep in it for you. there will
probably be two of us along for the ride. we would
need to be back to the airport on the 20th at 9 am or
so. let me know if you can help me help you ;)
