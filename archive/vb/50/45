Yes, if you can put up with the U-haul baloney, their AT will take the bus
very nicely. I took my bus from Texas to Arkansas at 65 the whole way, no
problem. Just make sure your tow vehicle can take the load.

Back to U-haul. Do not take their word on anything. You will show up to get
the AT and SURPRISE!!! they don't have one. Even though you reserved one
with a credit card. Then they will send you to another location that thought
they had one and SURPRISE!!! they don't. Then they will send you 40 miles
away to get one , and SURPRISE!!! they're closed. Believe me, this is all a
true story. Somebody finally gave me a regional corporate phone number and a
name and after I convinced him that everyone that worked for U-haul should
be fired NOW they found me one in a town only 50 miles away, in the wrong
direction. It cost me a day of travel, a cancellation fee for a hotel room,
$150 bucks for the tow truck I had rented and all the gas I burnt in the
behemoth running around trying to find the trailer I had reserved with a
credit card. Not to speak of the years taken off my life with the
aggravation. Trust no one. Good luck.

Thanks to the MANY encouraging responses and advice I have received from all
listees. The trailer that UHAUL rents and which I am planning on using
(their AT trailer) is 14' long dual axle which I hope is long enough- has
someone actually used a UHAUL AT (Auto Transport) trailer and can vouch that
the bus will actually fir on the trailer?

Thanks again everyone!!

Michael
