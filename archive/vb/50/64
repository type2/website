Howdy,

On the subject of the tow dollies, beware.  I had one
reserved when in Tucson, and once we got there, they
asked for the license # of the vehicle being towed. 
Since it was not currently registered and consequently
had no plates, they said it could not go on a dolly,
that it had to have all the wheels off of the ground. 
So my only option was to go with the AT.  Thanks a
lot, Uhaul.
