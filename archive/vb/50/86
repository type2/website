What am I seeing? is the cable extended with the sleeve or is the clamp
holding all the cable tension  (That does not sound good if it is - I
would not trust it)  is it early or late 59?

We are working on an extension for the original length 59 ones for the
big nut tranny adaptation.

We are looking for a new set of 59's with the zirc fittings like the
original.
