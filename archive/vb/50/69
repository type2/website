       I am not much of an Empi fan, but they do make an adapter for about 
$10.00.  It's pretty heavy metal wise.  The only problem I had was the 
bracket was a little to thick causing the transaxle to sit a little to far 
back.  This was cured with a grinder, and a little trial and error.
                                                            Peace,
                                                             F.W.Tyler
                                                             To many VW's to 
list.
