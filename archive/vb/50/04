Thanks so much! Inquiries about donations should always be sent to
<donations(-at-)type2.com> whence they are forwarded to Ted Finesman, Official
Treasurer, and he will get back to you.

Copying the lists, hope you don't mind.

BTW due to hosting costs, a ten dollar donation keeps both sites and both
lists on the air for exactly 48 hours.
