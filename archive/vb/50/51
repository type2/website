i'm sitting here listening to the rain hit the roof of the house , the weather man says it will turn to sleet or snow any minute, and i,m thinking this is gonna be a long winter. has anyone got a video of either octo or classic weekend 2001 for sale, it doesn't have to be edited or a pro tape just something that would give a good representation of the weekend.any help will be appreciated
