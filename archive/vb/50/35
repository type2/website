Good point Blake. FYI the price they quote you is not written in stone. I =
told them their competitors beat their price and they magically cut their =
price 10%. I guess they are prepared to comprimise their profit margin for =
the interest of the sale.

Michael,

Well, first of all, I spent $1600 for the bus.  I
spent $1400 for the truck (a 14') and trailer.  They
didn't tell me when I made my reservations that there
was an extra $300 insurance charge, and that if I
didn't pay it if anything happened to the truck or
trailer, I would owe them for the entire rig.  That
wasn't too cool.  Once we got the truck, it was a
constant battle to keep the thing above 50 mph.  This
was not uphill, or in a bad wind, it just wanted to go
slower.  Of course, we are stupid and went to AZ in
June, and the AC didn't work so well.  Overall, it
drove and pulled OK, but going up the mountains
between Phoenix and Flagstaff sucked.  Really, the
expense of it was what I didn't like, but I'm a cheap
bastard.
