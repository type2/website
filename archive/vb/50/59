Hi Volks,
Unfortunitly carbon monoxide is an odorless gas, so having a alarm or two 
better yet would be a must with a nonstock/badly designed muffler for the 
type 2.  Many decades ago a step mother of our's and two of her siblings as 
childern were in the back seat of a large USA auto.  There was a small 
exhaust leak under the auto and a pin hole in the body that allowed the 
exhaust gas to be sucked in.  Result the three childern almost did not wake 
up after a long drive.  The parents of these three both were in the medical 
field.  The father had done work for several decades as a medic in the USAF 
in rescue of downed fliers and the mother a registered nurse.  Both had no 
problems with thier noses during the monoxide incident, and were not affected 
enough to notice the danger!
  Since often passengers in the rear of buses fall asleep on long trips it 
would be not very nice to find out that these passengers had expired by the 
time you arrived at the destination.    Eric&Barb
