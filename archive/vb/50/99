Subject: Repro Taillights


I just got my repro 58-61 taillights from Ronnie,
and I must say that I'm impressed!  These are very
well done, and very clean.  I'm tempted to put these
on the panel and the OG ones on the trailer - seriously!
The reflector section is really nice and shiny - better
than the ones I'm running now!
