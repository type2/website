What 'u-shaped adapter' did you try?  I've done this conversion a couple 
of times now with no problems.  You need the later type2 nose cone
and the *bus* (NOT BUG) adapter made by either Wolfgang or BusBoys.  I
ran my '56 kombi this way for several years, and it's still running around
Arizona to this day.  I also put one in my '55 westy, and it's running
around Japan now.

The downside is you'll get more tranny noise, because it's a solid piece.
I don't know of anyone who's made one with a rubber isolater; probably not
enough of a market for it.  I partially solved the problem by squeezing a
1/4" piece of rubber sheet between the mount and the body, which reduced
the noise a little.  In a crew cab it's probably not as big of a deal.
