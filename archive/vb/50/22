Subject: FW: FW: [VB] Trailering Bus

I've only ever towed buses with a tow bar.  This last summer I towed my '58
panel about 350 miles.
Last Sept., instead of going to the Gerome Jamboree like we were supposed
to, one of my friends 
towed a '61 DC from Oregon to Utah...with a tow bar.  Of course before we
tow we always make sure
everything works...almost always.  This last summer, we were towing a '65
westy home with the tow bar 
and on the freeway going about 45mph the transmission locked up.  It was
pretty scary at the time.
So in conclusion, if you do use a tow bar, make sure everything is in good
working order and be safe.
