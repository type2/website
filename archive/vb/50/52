Subject: Re: [VB] Headlight Bucket Rebuilding

I think I know exactly what you are talking about.
Your talking about the kind that has a sorta arrow
that threads onto the adjuster, and the arrow part
goes through a piece of rubber that is attached to the
bucket, and the rubber dries up. There is hope, there
is a different style of bucket that doesn't use the
rubber pieces that dry up and stop working properly.
There is a bucket that has a wire rod/spring that does
all the adjusting. I tried finding a picture of one to
send you, but I couldn't find one, sorry.  
 Good luck
  Mike
