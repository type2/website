Subject: Re: [VB] checking out a far away bus

Matt,

I did something similar quite recently on my search for a Splitty.  What I 
did was go to the Car Talk section of Cars.Com (you've heard of Click and 
Clack, the Tappit Brothers, right?), and use their MechanX Files to hunt up 
a few highly recommended Mechanics is the area (the database logs 
recommendatations from real people about honest -gasp- mechanics).  Then I 
called those mechanics to see which would be open to looking into the 
vechical for me.  Then I looked up Street Rod companies using Yahoo Yellow 
Pages to find a qualified auto appraiser to also check the vechical out.  
Surprisingly, I found both a mechanic and auto appraiser willing to work for 
me at a distance.  The whole affar ended up costing me about $500, but was 
well worth it since it made me feel a WHOLE lot more secure about plopping 
down 12Gs sight-unseen.

PS - That is a REAL GOOD looking splitty.  Makes me wish I hadn't already 
bought mine (a real project-case).

Good Luck

Richard

The following bus caught my eye -
http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=598536870
- and it has occurred to me to try to have it checked out, but I have no
real idea how to go about this.

I apologize if this is an FAQ, but any suggestions?...

Thanks very much,
Matthew Weymar
