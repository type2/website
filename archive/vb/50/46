She RUNS! But things do not fit. :-(  69 westie

Run in on my rebuild went great, so threw that puppy in and went for a spin
around town. She ran great! Highest temperature was 210 going up hill. Did a
little foothill drive at all speeds. She seems very smooth. We will see.

Note to self: Before rebuilding a 34pict3 for a single port engine, make
sure it will fit on the SP manifold.:-(

I was faced with another carb rebuild job or buy a new, one so new won out
in the name of time. The 30pict works great. Anybody want to buy a fresh
34pict3? I have another to use if I need one in the future.

I bought a German bug exhaust with two pea shooters that I thought would
fit. It cleared the rear apron, but the bumper will not fit back on. Cwis
Slaymaker had a tube that connected the two outlets into one tail pipe.
Would this solve this problem? It seems I have seen the bug exhaust work for
others. Is it a 1969 thing?
