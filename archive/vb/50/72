Subject: Slight OT: Yahoo Messenger Skins

Hey all,

Okay, this technically is on topic, but I wanted to see if anyone else out 
there uses Yahoo Messenger and has downloaded the new version that allows 
for custom backgrounds and icons.  I wandered around the net for a while 
and found no early VW related skins out there, so I created a few of my 
own.  I have one made from an Australian bus and one made from an old piece 
of artwork.  They're small .zip files and if anyone wanted them, I'd be 
happy to email them out.  I'm also willing to take a couple requests from 
people who have pics they'd like to see as a skin.

Yahoo also has a page on how to make your own for those more graphically 
inclined: http://messenger.yahoo.com/messenger/help/themes.html
