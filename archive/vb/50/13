This virus is not being sent through the Vintage bus list server, but
rather, people that get the Re: email with outlook express, it automatically
asks you if you would like to view the attachement (I've never seen one
automatically ask this without you clicking on the attachment, but they
figured out a way).  If you click yes to view this, you have the virus, so
always, always say no, and virus scan the email attachments before reading
them (I do this to friends also).  Once you have a virus, it goes through
your outlook and emails itself to people you have in your outlook (hence the
vintage bus list).

I have received this file 6 times so far from:
Grace Casperson gcas(-at-)terragon.com
K.JEVEC jevec(-at-)tcsn.net
john & teresa circlep(-at-)flash.net
Sherry Cavaness scavaness(-at-)earthlink.net
POINTSHAVER pointshaver(-at-)mindspring.com
Keith Turner Vwrelics1(-at-)btopenworld.com

If you see your name here, you have the virus, and keep sending it out to
people.

If not, now you know not to open any attachments.

Thank you
Charles
