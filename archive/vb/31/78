Subject: RE: [VB] Type 1 in a 74 bus

Just to be a grumpy old man...  The type 4 motor is superior to the type1
motor.

The type 4 will last longer and be easier maintenance in the long run.

So if you can, stick with the original motor.

Granted if anyone has used/busted type4 motors they want to part with in the
south east region near Atlanta let me know :)  I am thinking of a type4
conversion for my '66 and if this goes well maybe start a weekend shop to
help others do the same conversion.  Kind of an out of my garage thing.  If
the motors come out too expensive I will not bother (no demand), but if I
can do this conversion on the frugal side like $1500-$2000 I think people
would go for it..?  Also I do not want to make a poor product either so it
cannot be too cheap if you know what I mean.  Trust me I do not plan to make
a fortune on this either, just barely enough to justify my time and beer
fund :)  I like to turn wrenches what can I say.
