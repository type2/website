Subject: RE: [VB] Re: new Coleman portable heater


here i Canada, its often cold, as now october get out,so our heating =
manner
change.

I tried several heaters, at the end we are using the BN4 with timer =
before
sleep and/ or at wakening.. but also we use for all night a coleman
catalytic heater wich use naphta or white gas, you can easily find that =
at
5-10$in flea market, as i found recently a NEW old stock one for 10 =
buck,
never used.  We tried the green one as seen on ebay at the link at the
bottom,

http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=3D1011406204

 wich are the more powerful one, but we got back to the red on wich are
smaller and about 5000 BTU (green one are at 8000 BTU)

We lit the heater before bed and it heat all night long, can even do 2 =
full
night once filled, it produce a slight, gentle heat, we close the =
poptop
(westfalia 73), open a small windows... and sleep confortable !!  Once =
we
had one of these and it was producing bad and strange gas, so we got =
rid and
got another for 5$.. usually when you light it it should not produce =
any
gas...

The way to light it, just turn it over, so the mesh look at the ground,
about 30 sec-1 min, then you should have a spot on the mesh no larger =
than a
quarter, lit the mesh, it will produce a big flame then in 1 min it =
will go
back to a hard to see flame,.. all you can see is the mesh goin red in =
th
dark, no flame, no danger to adjacent furniture.

Here is the red we use and found it enough to heat all night our =
westfalia
73:

If anybody want i still have the instruction and How to change the =
mesh, i
can scan it and send it, as sometime the mesh is too dry so its not =
good
anymore....but out of 6 heater i got, only 1 was defect...BTW its a
discontinued product..

By the way, the best prices I found online (under $70) were at:

http://shop.store.yahoo.com/csskiequipment/colpowporcat.html

and the Cabela's site.  Many of the vendors report the item not being
available, but I don't know if they're accurate.

I placed an order through the "Cool Sports Equipment" site (yahoo =
store) and
the total was just over $70, shipped ground to Tallahassee.  I'll =
advise any
problems.

FWIW, when I camp in my bus where there's electric available, I use an
electric resistive heater circa 1950's vintage and have even used an
electric blanket.  I'm=20
looking forward to having something to knock the AM chill off when I'm
outside the grid, though -- and hoping to find more and more ways to =
get
outside the grid....
