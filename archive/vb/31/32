Subject: RE: [VB] new Coleman portable heater

On this indoor heater note does anyone know of a good electric ceramic core
heater?

I would like to stay away from electric element and propane heaters because
we camp with a youngster (5 month old).

In our area it is starting to get cold enough to justify a heater if we keep
camping on through winter...  Which I hope to do :)  Muuuhahahahaha

TIA,
