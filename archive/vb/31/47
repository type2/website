Nice little show in the lot around Chirco's. My alltime favorite swaps for
the "score" type of purchase. Every year I've found something that made the
trip worthwhile, even if I didn't plan on buying. Don't much look at the
bugs and Ghia's and sandrails, they are too shiny. Always 8 or 10 buses
though. Gotta go to Buses and Balloons this year though, so you can have
what I was going to buy.
