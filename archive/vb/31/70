In the FSV's we used an extended double pump.  It was driven off cam just
like stock, but was longer and had the pressure portion and a scavenge
portion.  The gears were longer on the scavenge side to keep ahead of the
pressure side.  The pressure side was adjustable to maintain 8olbs pressure
at 8,000rpm.  We carried an 8 qt tank for storage of the oil.  Baffles were
placed in tank to prevent foaming of the oil at return to engine.  We used
stock pickup tube in engine block for scavenging.
