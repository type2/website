So the pump was something like the autostick beetle pump, with two pumping
chambers separated by a sealed partition?

Interesting idea, but it doesn't seem to be applicable to buses.  We just
don't have enough cornering forces to cause oiling problems.

It would be nice to put the oil filter on the scavenge side, since this
would not result in a pressure drop to the bearings.  Is this common
practice in dry-sump engines?
