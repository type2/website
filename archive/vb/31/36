Subject: Re: [VB] Re: new Coleman portable heater

I got a Coleman Black Cat Heater last fall and use it while camping. I don't
care to have the heater on while I'm sleeping, aside from the safety
concerns, I'm too warm with a sleeping bag and a heater. However, I do turn
on the heater as soon as I wake up, I also start my single burner stove to
make coffee and by the time coffee's ready, the inside of the bus is warm
enough to be pleasant. The important thing for me is that the heater keeps
the interior of the bus nice enough during the day to be a good refuge from
the cold even when the temps dip into the teens. It's also good for keeping
food etc. from freezing. Remember the camper's old adage: "If you want to
stay warm, stay home."
