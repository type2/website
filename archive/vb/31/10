Subject: Automatic Choke Question

I recently rebuilt the shortblock for my '67, 1600cc engine.  Put in a
new crank and rods.  Got it all back together and in the bus.  After I
got the timing right (stock vacuum distributor) and pumped some gas into
the carb, it started right up.

Unfortunately, once the autochoke warms up, the engine dies.  I though,
"OK, it's running too lean, maybe during the rebuild something got in
the carb and is blocking fuel flow.   There's fuel to the carb (put on a
clear gas line to confirm), no intake manifold leakage I can find (new
gaskets).

So I pulled the carb last night and rebuilt it (a few pieces of grass
clipping(?) came out of the float bowl when I drained it). Otherwise all
looked clean.  Blew everything clean and dry, put it back on and I still
start fine when cold but die when the choke turns off.

This afternoon I disconnected the automatic choke so the ceramic heater
doesn't warm up and close the butterfly valve.  Drove it around just
fine.  Parked, reconnected the automatic choke and within a minute it
died at idle.  It goes without saying that I'd prefer not to drive
around with the choke on.

Do I just have R*TB*ST*RDS in my bus?

Any other ideas?
