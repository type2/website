Has everyone read both of the Hoover articles on cam dial in?

I have and am at a dilemma.  Imperative is getting it to a gnats ass?  I
know what he would say and in theory, I agree.  Part of me wants to go
and find the perfect OG gear drill the rivets and make an adjustable
gear and go through all the fun of dialing it in.  The other practical
part says build the damn motor and get the truck running...dumb ass!

So, if I go through the standard procedure and the gear that came with
my new CB cam fits (is within tolerance) should I worry?  Or is it worth
it to really "dial it in".

Anyone?

Thanks.

Steve
