Probably not a big one if you pay attention to the oil level.  You have
about 2 liters of oil in the engine and the valve covers can hold about
1/2 liter each.  If they were both full that leaves 1 liter to sit in
the sump.  Now, combine this with going around a corner and you might
uncover the oil pickup, but I doubt that this would be a problem in a bus.

My major complaint with deep sumps is that they add complexity and reduce
ground clearance.  One good whack with a rock and the case is endangered!
