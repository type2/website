One modification Porsche made to the dry sump system occurred in 1971
when they installed squirters in the case webs pointing at tha back-side of the pistons
to provide cooling and splash lubrication.
Another modification occurred in 1976, when they increased the sixe of the pressure
portion of the oil pump, and decreased the scavenge portion, routing the oil more directly
to the inlet via bypass, saving a full trip to the sump and through the tank again.
There may also be a benefit from parts that are not constantly immersed in hot oil, but
hosed down from a constant fresh supply of cooled oil.
