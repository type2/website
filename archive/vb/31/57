The aircooled horizontally-opposed similarly-designed six cylinder
Porsche engine is dry sump as well. Oil travels through the bearing circuit,
deposits in the bottom of the engine, and a return, or scavanger, pump
returns it to an external tank wher the process repeats.
Thus, the sump is dry. ( Think- " sump pump " :)
