Thanks, Clara. I took the camper's front seats to Tijuana Upholstery here =
in Fresno, will use the 21w's seat for my test drives and a little camping =
trip next week. Will have to throw a Vanagon bucket seat in for the =
passenger's side temporarily. They'll kind of match the cream vinyl with =
blue fabric inserts of the Riviera for $110 a side, includes spring repair =
and padding. Beats the TMI price for just the vinyl covers.=20

Wanted to mention that Karl's '67 camper is in the 11/01 issue of HotVW's, =
page 65, coverage of the OCTO show. It's right behind my DC. Nearly the =
same pic as VWTrends of last month. Good pics of the Classic, lowered Euro =
panel featured, and how to make new front door panels from masonite. Type =
2 column features fire fighting vehicles and there's a nice article about =
the first 2 and 4 cyl. Porsche design engines. Might be worth picking up =
this month.=20
