The site and video explicitly refers to using it in a tent -- but also notice that in every case we're shown someone opening a window, or the unit by an open window.  
Clearly expected to be used with some ventilation.

There are also links to Coleman's "BlackCat" non-powered heaters.  I'm shopping for good prices right now -- these babies were hard to find last winter, and even 
here in FL, I do some winter camping with overnights in the teens and 20's.
