Subject: Sump

While running FV's AI would use the 500CC sump(rules would not allow
anything larger),a windage tray, and a trick with the push rod tubes to
prevent excess oil going into the rockers during cornering.  Take a push
rod tube and cut the end off midway through the rib, shove the tube into
the block and then install standard push rod tube.  The lip extending into
the block would prevent oil from rushing into the rocker area. (Should say
slow down not prevent).  Long corners in racing would eat up engines
without this modification.  In FSV's with the original 1600CC type4, the
rules allowed us to dry sump the engine which eliminated the problem.
