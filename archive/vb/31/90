i gave the welding supply house a call for recommendations. they gave me a
short list of good brazers, and the one closest to me turned out to be a
good fellah. oxy/acet with a handheld stick of something. rough grinding to
knock off the bigger stuff.  i took it home to file and sand, until it
looked like a gold filling. now in primer, i am grateful and hats to the
list.   another 35 years for this door

thanks all for your input on this. some folks around town suggested it'd be
cheaper to just hang a scrapyard door instead of hiring skilled labor.
turned out to be a ten dollar or in-trade choice. a better way to go.
