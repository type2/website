Hi Bob,
The Coleman site lists these as ideal for (<<Use it in your tent, garage, 
shop, ice shanty or the house if the power goes out. >>) and none of them are 
small autos.  They are either much larger in size and/or better ventilated 
places.  Even in RVs that use this kind of heating system RV suppliers warn 
that a low oxygen alarm must be used!
