Thank you Jim!=20

This was exactly what I was after:

429911    Kozy-World=AE Ceramic Safety Furnace  In Stock  $39.99 =20
from http://www.boatus-store.com/MC_Online/Browse.asp?ShowItem=3D43137

Again I like the ceramic core since kids will be around it... Anal I =
know...
Probably could burn themselves anyway on it somehow if they applied
themselves.

Also if we are camping in the winter electric heater is a must!  YMMV=20

Boats get all the cool toys :)

Thanks,
