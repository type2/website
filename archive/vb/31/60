Subject: two weld q's, one spec to DC

hi listees, kelly,  - welding questions: i have a stress crack i'd like to
nip and wonder what would be the best welding method to repair it. two
inches, passenger side door, above the side mirror. i've heard a braze
would be best, but a neighbor has oxy acetylene and is glad to do it. i'm
unsure that might be too hot.  meantime, the bed of my DC has a
side-to-side seam never apparently welded, but leaks and allows a lake in
the cargo/rear cab. would i be wrong in having this seam welded, or use a
more flexible filler since it wasn't welded at the factory?  TIA   - steve,
68DC
