Subject: Re: [VB] Type 1 in a 74 bus

Make sure the engine is supported by more then just bolted to the transaxle. 
  There are only two bolts at the transaxle supporting it so if you add the 
weight of the engine without any other support you are asking for problems 
down the road.  Also see if any additional sheet metal was put around the 
engine.  There is alot of open area when you stick a type I engine in a type 
IV bus.  Without the extra sheet metal the bus has probably been running 
hot.  In the winter that isn't so bad but the heat damage to the engine 
could have already taken place.
