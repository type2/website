Subject: re; new Coleman portable heater    Buskatier Campout

As nice as it is to have this kind of heat you have to remember that propane
pumps out a lot of moisture and if you don't mind the inside of your
bus/tent/outhouse etc....getting wet then fine.  I used ours last year in
our tent and it almost made it colder as everything gets a coating of
humidity on it.  Try sleeping in a sleeping bag that is wet on the outside.
Not fun

Speaking of that the Buskatiers are having a campout on the last weekend of
this month at the 4 corners area of Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri at
the Indian Cave state park in the south eastern tip of Nebraska.  The trees
will be changing color and the squirrels will be grabbing their nuts.  There
will be a haunted Halloween hay rack ride and lots of craft type things
going on.  The link to the VW campout is at www.Bustoberfest.com
Check it out and then come check us out
Get your nuts out of the chair and come camping with us
