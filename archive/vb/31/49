Subject: Re: [VB] Re: new Coleman portable heater

I'll stick my nickle in here as it seems to be a recurring thread. I've got
the large green coleman thats been in the family since the 60's. Like
Michael said it adjusts from 3-5000btu's. We first used it in a tent camper
and now I use it in our westies. I just recently found the red 3000btu here
in Victoria, from what I've seen the small one was only sold in Canada.
Things I like, I have small kids and really dont want them to burn
themselves, the original coleman lit tells you that you can set a piece of
paper on it and it wont ignite. Experiance shows me that thats pretty close,
you wouldnt want to leave your hand on it, but you wouldnt get instant 2nd
or 3rd degree burns.
I have mixed feelings about propane, I dont like haveing empty canisters to
throw away and I'm not real sure I want a gas that seeks low places in the
camper.
I like simple, add white fuel, tip, and light and youve got heat. I set it
on the sink, crack a vent and just let it sit, it'll turn itsself off when
it runs out of fuel.
Call me a throw back, all my camp gear is white gas, dont even ask how many
lanterns I own, but camping in the bush, towns are kinda scarce and a gallen
of white fuel goes a long way. I've been told but cant verify that white
fuel is only unleaded gas, might be why coleman sells a duel fuel product.

here i Canada, its often cold, as now october get out,so our heating manner
change.

I tried several heaters, at the end we are using the BN4 with timer before
sleep and/ or at wakening.. but also we use for all night a coleman
catalytic heater wich use naphta or white gas, you can easily find that at
5-10$in flea market, as i found recently a NEW old stock one for 10 buck,
never used.  We tried the green one as seen on ebay at the link at the
bottom,

http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=1011406204

 wich are the more powerful one, but we got back to the red on wich are
smaller and about 5000 BTU (green one are at 8000 BTU)

We lit the heater before bed and it heat all night long, can even do 2 full
night once filled, it produce a slight, gentle heat, we close the poptop
(westfalia 73), open a small windows... and sleep confortable !!  Once we
had one of these and it was producing bad and strange gas, so we got rid and
got another for 5$.. usually when you light it it should not produce any
gas...

The way to light it, just turn it over, so the mesh look at the ground,
about 30 sec-1 min, then you should have a spot on the mesh no larger than a
quarter, lit the mesh, it will produce a big flame then in 1 min it will go
back to a hard to see flame,.. all you can see is the mesh goin red in th
dark, no flame, no danger to adjacent furniture.

Here is the red we use and found it enough to heat all night our westfalia
73:

If anybody want i still have the instruction and How to change the mesh, i
can scan it and send it, as sometime the mesh is too dry so its not good
anymore....but out of 6 heater i got, only 1 was defect...BTW its a
discontinued product..

By the way, the best prices I found online (under $70) were at:

http://shop.store.yahoo.com/csskiequipment/colpowporcat.html

and the Cabela's site.  Many of the vendors report the item not being
available, but I don't know if they're accurate.

I placed an order through the "Cool Sports Equipment" site (yahoo store) and
the total was just over $70, shipped ground to Tallahassee.  I'll advise any
problems.

FWIW, when I camp in my bus where there's electric available, I use an
electric resistive heater circa 1950's vintage and have even used an
electric blanket.  I'm
looking forward to having something to knock the AM chill off when I'm
outside the grid, though -- and hoping to find more and more ways to get
outside the grid....
