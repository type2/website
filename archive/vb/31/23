Have you tried adjusting the choke?  Hose down the linkage with
carb cleaner to make sure all is moving freely.  Then let the
Bus sit all night in normal weather (like, don't try this if
the night is especially cold or hot for the season).  In the
morning, take off the air cleaner and loosen up the screws on
the choke housing.  Rotate the housing back and forth, make 
sure the butterfly moves.  Rotate the housing to where the
butterfly *just* closes and that should be pretty close.

Good troubleshooting idea, but don't leave it on there.  That clear
vinyl tubing is not rated for fuel and will deteriorate.

Did you put the carb through the vat of carb cleaner?  If not,
and you still have problems after adjusting the choke, try it.
I have used Berryman B-12 in the gallon paint can.  It smells
vile (use it outside) and it will straighten out your DNA (wear
gloves) but it will clean the carb like nothing else.

Er, the heater *opens* the butterfly as it warms up.

I'd say to adjust the choke, warm up the engine, make sure the
carb is all the way off, and then adjust the carb with the engine
warm.  If you have it running well while warm, the extra help
from the choke should make it start OK when cold.  If you can't
get any joy out of adjusting the choke and the carb, then put the
carb through the vat o' cleaner.

Good luck!
