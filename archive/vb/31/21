I've heard the LV show is no good. I've also heard that the Busses and 
Balloons show is way more fun.
You can gamble at our Indian casino's and loose your money just like LV.
I really don't know anything about the LV show I'm just trying to get you to 
come to Busses and Balloons V.
We have a 3/4 bus roof rack and a brand new beetle wood slat rack as main 
raffle prizes. I bet LV doesn't have that.
