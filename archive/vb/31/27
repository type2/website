Hi Diana,
The 1964-67 RGB plugs have no threads on them so they can not be stripped.  
We drill and pull them out with a body dent puller and have them welded back 
up later. Just make sure to scrape the edge of the plugs to remove and 
crud/rust that might not allow them to slide out.  It does sound like a good 
idea to just park your bus till you save up enough to have the tranny center 
section rebuilt and install new RGB bearings at that time.  Otherwise at the 
least remove the engine and tranny and fix the leaks, the stuck plug and 
replace the RGB bearings, which should cost about $250.00 in bearings alone.  
Far less cost than if a lower inner bearing fails and that rear 
tire/drum/axle pops out on the freeway!     Eric&Barb
