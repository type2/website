Subject: Re: Engines Question

Hello Everyone 


	I am getting ready to buy a new engine and I am wondering which
engine size I should get. I am looking at a 1776 or 1915 and it will be
a daily commuter up and down a couple of grades each day. It will be for
my 65 deluxe and will be in a climate no hotter than 80F on a good day.
I am also contemplating the carb size whether I should buy a Weber
progressive or dual 40 IDF's. 


Any help appreciated,
Eric Lykens
65 Deluxe 21
