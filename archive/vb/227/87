This can be checked by us 'non-college' folk as well.

Run some small clear tubing (fish store would be ideal), and run the hose
from the driver seat, back to the engine bay. Put the end of the hose in a
jar filled with colored water and haul ass down the freeway. The more the
water sucks up the clear tube, the more vacuum there is. (the smaller the
tube the better). Bad part is, this gives no 'numbers' to reference for
other people. We can just say "it pulled up this high on the hose". Not very
scientific, BUT, it could tell you if any mods you made reduced engine bay
vacuum or not, and by how much.

That's one thing to do actually! Someone that has scoops, run this
experiment, then, take the scoops off, and repeat the exact same drive, and
not the difference in engine bay vacuum. That would settle it once and for
all if the scoops actually delivered more air into the engine bay.

For engine bay temps, a simple inside/outside digital themometer from the
auto parts isle at the grocery store (about $15) could read the differences
there too.  I would do that myself, but I've removed the front tin in my
bus, and people could call the results inaccurate.

Any takers for this experiment?
