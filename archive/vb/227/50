A half-degree step is fine, you can read finer than that.  I use a regular
protractor.

measuring on a flat floor is important.  No sense in correcting errors in

When measuing the spring plate angle, be sure to lift the spring plate to
take the slack out of the splines.

Resist the urge to crank in a little extra twist.  Stick with the specs!

Measure twice, cut once.
