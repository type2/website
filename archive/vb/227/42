  They are on the 4th production run, maybe the 5th by now.

ps. 3 cars at VW Drag days, that I know of (all 2332) were running the
aluminum cases, including one using EMPI's version of the case

It's good to hear that they finally got it right.

I've heard from a number of people that were still finding green loctite in
