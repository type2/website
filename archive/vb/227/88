Eric,

Actually, you could quantify the colored water in a tube pressure 
measurement by first taping the tube to, say the b pillar.  make a mark with 
a sharpie where the water is with the engine off, then make another mark for 
the water level when haulin' down the freeway.  Subtract the two distances, 
then convert: 1 inch of h20 = 0.249 kPa.
