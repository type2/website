Subject: Re: [VB] side scoops any opinions

Yah, I run my '67 with the scoops on during the mild winters here in 
Tucson.  I did a cross country trip through some cold and windy weather 
last november and encountered a real problem with the engine running too 
cool.  I increased the ignition timing and bought cheap gas.   This 
helped a bit.  Still, you could touch the motor and feel only the 
slightest warmth.  This made for poor fuel economy!   Gary  Gibson
