Oh yeah, that reminds me: Be sure to paint any scratches on the t-bar
before installing it, right up to where the splines begin. I brush on some
clear POR-15. Makes it look great, it cures in five hours, and will
protect the bar from corrosion and premature failure. Wipe the t-bar down
with a residue-free solvent first so the paint/POR will adhere well (I use
a quick light swabbing with Fast Acrylic Laquer Thinner, dries in seconds,
degreases with the best of them. Careful - highly toxic, like gasoline -
use gloves).
