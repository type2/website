Subject: NEW aluminum case pics

ok, round 2. thanks to ronnie ("craig, at this point its not about 
losing money!") feitson, aip sent me a new aluminum case. Why go back 
for more punishment? Mainly cuz ronnie would replace the old case 
with a mexibrazil stock one, but he would eat the cost; aip would 
only replace like with like. anyways, i have a page up with some pics 
and some first impressions:

remembers half its commands :P
