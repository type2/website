I actually just pulled my engine this weekend to do some work on it (install
thermo and flaps, and other jank), and found that the engine was not 'caked'
with grime or dirt of any sort. This is after driving it like this over 16K
miles, most of that in the desert of Las Vegas and drives up canyons on dirt
roads.

This has shown to not be a problem for me. One of these days I will see
about making a front tin out of expanded metal, just in case of debris in
the future.
