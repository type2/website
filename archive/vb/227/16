Hi Rex,
Once apon a time a gal came to our Cascade Kombis Club and complained of her 
engine runing too hot even though at the time it was winter here in the PNW.  
Eric went out to look at her bus and once the engine compartment was opened 
he reached around the fan shroud and pulled out a college ruled three ringed 
binder piece of paper.  Instantly her over heating problem was solved!  This 
with the engine compartment completely sealed and the stock vents still in 
place.
  On the other hand we had a friend who bought herself a bus with no idea of 
what she was doing.  We installed a oil temp gauge and a few weeks later 
pulled the engine to replace the missing forward engine tin.  This resulted 
in a 20F drop in oil temp in 70F weather!
