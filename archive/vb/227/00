Hi Dave,

Since you are running a T4 upright conversion the setup I have will not work 
for you at all.

The Phat Boys I have seen on T4 uprights have all been home made custom kind 
of things, but very doable with a MIG welder.  Granted they were in sedans 
and not a bus...

The T4 is just crippled by poor available exhaust systems until you pay some 
real $$$ to get a nice one that is more of a full merged kind of thing.

As for pictures I can work on that in a few days and maybe swindle some 
webspace from Rex for everyone to see :)

Take Care,
Adrian
