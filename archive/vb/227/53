The gutters are good on my bus - however my rockers are definately the
second set if not 3rd or 4th- mine is a UK RHD bus - to find one that hasn't
had the bottom 6" all the way round replaced is very rare over here!
Using the gutter I have found that front to back on each side is pretty much
spot on the same, and from side to side it is less than 0.25deg difference.
Obviously the underseal had more of an effect than I thought....

I am chasing every thread to before replacing them.  I have been quite lucky
with some of my bolts compared to friends buses - though I think by having
good quality tools it helps.

Can't wait to get it rolling again - I took it off the road at the end of
October to do a mechanical refresh - and still haven't finished - getting
there though - got all my parts back and ready to bolt on now!

Thanks a lot
