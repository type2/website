Subject: Re: [VB] car shows... i'm bummed

I agree. Most shows are done by noon, but maybe it's a way to get you to drop a little more green at vendor booths or in the swap. 
On another subject, If you do set up a "display" in the swap let people know it is a display. I get irritated at some swappers who put out a bunch of stuff and when you ask about it you get, " That? Oh, thats a '67 NOS ambulance fan that i found at a local dealership and blah, blah, blah. It's for display only i'm never going to  be selling it."  My feeling is that if your not selling it leave it at home or at least in your car if you are swapping. I walk the swap looking for parts, not to hear braggards tell me how cool they are. But then again I might be easily irritated!?

To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no choreography, and the dancers hit each other.
