Subject: Re: [VB] Spring plate angle - lost settings...

Hi Cal,

Thanks a lot for your explanation - it doesn't seem as if it will be too bad
to do then.  I don't have the Sears magnetic angle finder, in the UK we
don't have Sears unfortunately and I had to pay 2.5 times the price of the
Sears one to get one that doesn't seem to be as good as the one in the Sears
online catalogue.

With using the rain gutter on each side, the bus can have a different
inclination on each side from back to front, as long as the difference is
the 20 degrees required - correct me if I am wrong in assuming this please!

Will definately use the anti sieze on both ends - the fact that they were
seized caused most of my problems - well that and not marking it
properly....  I thought if I just popped off the spring plate it was easy to
put it back due to the fact that it was quite obvious it was in the right
place.  However the spring plate got stuck to the torsion bar and the
torsion bar came out and then the torsion bar came out of the spring plate.
Luckily catched the torsion bar so no damage was done.

Paul
