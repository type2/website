Subject: Aluminum block

A mechanic I trust with all my VW parts here in Seattle, Jerry at North West
Connecting Rod, had some interesting things to say about the dozen or so
aluminum blocks he has worked with. One of the things is clearance for welded
CW cranks. There are a lot of low budget CW cranks out there and many of them
need to have the case clearance. The lifter bore tops need to be surfaced and
chamfered to drop the lifters down enough to clear for even mild cams. Then
the issue of cooling because magnesium disperses heat faster than aluminum, it
seems to hold on to the heat raising the oil temp.

Knowing all this, I decided to give one a try and have it punched out to 90.5
and drilled for full flow.  I'm going to cork it first and try it with a dog
house cooler.\, but if it seems too hot I will go to an external cooler and
filter. Hopefully this won't end up to be the nightmare met with by others.
I'll keep you up to date.
