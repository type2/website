Subject: Re: [VB] survey: testing cooling etc [VB] was side scoops

Sounds good Mike,
I was thinking of a small enough hose that could exit the engine bay throug
the side vents, and go back into the bus through a popout window. A very
temporary setup for sure.

If we all agree'd on a position for the hose to take its 'reading' from in
the engine bay, a lot of us on the list could duplicate the test. Then we
could all share our results, giving RPM's, MPH, scoops or no scoops, etc,
etc.

I honestly thing we could get some very useful info from something like this
if enough of us did it. I would think taping the end of the hose to the
fanshroud where the coil mounts to would be a good universal location that
we could all go with.

Aquarium tubing is cheap, and wouldn't be too tough for a few of us to try
out. Who all is willing to try this and share results with the rest of us?
Share and compare......
