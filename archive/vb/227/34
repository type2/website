hm... I thought that they kept the recommended top/ cruising speed at about 
3500 rpms.   This for a 25hp bus though later uppright VWs.   Where did you 
see something different?  Just curious.

re vent design.  
For whatever reason, they did change the vents at the bd/post bd change. ( 
changed to 9 vents from 8, and the vents were shorter)

 Then again in  March 63 (VIN 1 080 104) (now 10 innies)

Actually the really early bds havd vertical vents didn't they?

Then there is the truck vent situation

And aussie buses had those nifty up top vents.   Ever notice how the dirt 
tends to be below the beltline?  The up top vent does make more sense.

I have no clue why they changed them, whether it was cosmetic or functional 
or whatever
