Tom, George,

I should have put in the smiley, I wuz joking.  Imagine a splittie going
fast enough to create a plasma!  They lack the insulating tiles!

Hey Tom, what do YOU know about smoke rising from a cigarette?!!!  You MIGHT
know a little about vapor/steam rising from a hotpot!  (Inside joke, folks!)
