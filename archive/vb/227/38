  Make sure you check the serial number on the case. Pre 3000 numbers have a
lot of little problems, 3001 to 4999 are better and all of the post 5000
numbers I have seen need nothing, they finally figured it out.
  My supplier has a jig they now use to check the crank, cam bore alignment.
I know nothing of EMPIS aluminum cases as I stick with who I have delt with.
  I am building case number 5356 right now and have not had to do anything
on the case for clearancing. Cam, crank (69 forged CW) or dizzy drive. I did
try 3 different styles of dizzy drives and found that the cases are
clearenced for a new Mexico drive and that an OG German drive has very tight
clearance. 
  I have not find any Locktite in any of the post 3000 number cases and very
little casting flash.
  The outside of the cases are very rough and are not pretty, but that
doesn't affect the assembly. Seems they improved the machining but let the
cosmedics slip.

Check for excess green locktite in oil galleys and such, the distributor
drive gear usually needs clearancing to be able to rotate freeley, etc, etc.

Make sure you do a complete test assembly to make sure you have no
interference problems, as well as make sure it is cleaned very well.  These
are problems common with just about all the aluminum cases that are coming
out. They're great cases once you get the quirks worked out of them.
