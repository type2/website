My Bus is a RHD Highroof walkthru with a slider on the drivers (right) side.
It was sent to Switzerland where a coachbuilder removed the cargo doors, 
and added in the slider. It was then put to use as a mail carrier for 
the Swiss PTT.
This is the 3rd  Bus I've seen with this conversion, and I've been told 
of a 4th, but haven't seen pictures.

I have factory photos of a VW built highroof with a slider, but it's not 
a walkthru or RHD

I'll get you my m-codes asap, and possibly the ones off the other 2 
Buses I've seen.
