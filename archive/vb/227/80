whichever seems easiest to you.

 Is it okay to just grease the rod and the bushes and fit it, or should I put 
something else into the tube to prevent rust and keep shifting slick?

not a bad idea to push a rag through the tube to kinda clean it out.   But I 
definately grease the tube and bushings as I put them in, dunno how else to 
lube it.

I guess after cleaning the tube you could push an oily rag through the tube 
to oil it.
