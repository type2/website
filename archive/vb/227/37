Subject: Re: [VB] Aluminum block

Check for excess green locktite in oil galleys and such, the distributor
drive gear usually needs clearancing to be able to rotate freeley, etc, etc.

Make sure you do a complete test assembly to make sure you have no
interference problems, as well as make sure it is cleaned very well.  These
are problems common with just about all the aluminum cases that are coming
out. They're great cases once you get the quirks worked out of them.
