No, plasma is disassociated nuclei and free electrons at very high temps.

Turbulent flow is simply air that has lost its smooth laminar flow
properties.  Think of smoke rising from a cigarette.  At first the stream
is smooth and straight, but further up it starts to roil and tumble.  The
smooth flow is laminar, the tumbling flow is turbulant.

The turbulant flow near the bus doesn't have as much velocity as the
laminar flow further out, so the pressure available is smaller.  That's
why the scoops on F1 cars and such extend quite a ways away from the car.
