BTDT didn't do much, even if was done to a Vanagon.
Mister in the intake scoop, thermometer near the
engine to measure air temp. Total reduction in
temp was about 5 degrees F. Not worth it.

However, cooling properties aside, back when I was stupid
and didn't know better, I made some scoops for my bus.
I was doing a bunch of kayaking at the time, and I made
the scoops about 4 inches out from the bus from sturdy
aluminum. They were strong enough and wide enough that I
could step inside the scoop and then stand on top to
secure the kayaks. At one time I had 7 kayaks on top with
as many people inside my '64 Deluxe. The sunroof made
tying off the front a snap. This was in the good old days
of giant kayaks, not the shrimpy boats of today.

Scoop & step, that's the functional version.
