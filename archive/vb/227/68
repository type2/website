Just between you, me, and the tree, a 1776 can't use all that a Weber
Progressive can deliver. The highest position I have had the throttle in is
3/4 and the engine was screaming! Anymore than that and I'd be afraid I would
split a crank.

Hello Everyone


	I am getting ready to buy a new engine and I am wondering which
engine size I should get. I am looking at a 1776 or 1915 and it will be
a daily commuter up and down a couple of grades each day. It will be for
my 65 deluxe and will be in a climate no hotter than 80F on a good day.
I am also contemplating the carb size whether I should buy a Weber
progressive or dual 40 IDF's.


Any help appreciated,
Eric Lykens
