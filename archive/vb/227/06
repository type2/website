Subject: Spring plate angle - lost settings...

I have now repainted my spring plates, and got the new rubbers for the
springplates - however I have also lost the internal position of the torsion
bar as well as the external one.

I have purchased a magnetic angle finder - however this isn't the greatest
quality and although it is graduated in half degree steps it is quite
difficult to read- though I believe half degree steps will be accurate enough
to set the angle - is this true??

With this I have found that my bus isn't level from side to side - it looks to
be about half a degree difference, and that the back to front angle is also
slightly different on each side.    Can this back to front angle be
compensated for by modifying the front tyre pressure in one tyre?  What effect
will the side to side difference have?  Why couldn't the builders make my
garage floor perfectly flat??

Anything I should look out for whilst doing this - or anyone got any tips on
how to make sure I get this right- I would prefer to not have to strip down
and retry the settings if possible!

On a positive note, my spring plates do look nice now as do the spring plate
covers!

Thanks
Paul
