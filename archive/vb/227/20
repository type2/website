On my engine that came out of my bus, it has an original looking piece of sheet metal that collects
hot air exiting the doghouse and routes it out through another original looking hole in the vertical
piece of the front engine tin.

This engine came out of a '71 autostick bug, I'm pretty sure. It had an autostick oil cooler on it
and a '71 serial number on the case. Do you think VW already discovered this cooling trick and made
it a stock feature?

>(flywheel end of the engine), my engine temps drop conciderably.

This is exactly what I was gonna try on my next bus. I'm thinking
maybe putting a screen in place of the tin might help keep any
unwanted debris from coming into the engine compartment....maybe not
needed....what do you think?

Oh yeah, routing the exhaust from the doghouse into a hose that takes
the hot air out one of the holes in the engine tin near where the
heat exchangers get air seems like the way to take care of that so it
won't be blown into the engine compartment. I'm horrible with
terminology and trying to explain....hopefully I made that somewhat
clear.

To me, this setup is THE way to keep your aircooled
engine....well....aircooled.
