The key to projects of this sort is KISS, keep it simple.  Get all the
parameters steady and then vary only one to see what the effect is.  For a
bus this is rather difficult, as there are a _lot_ of parameters.
Temperature, humidity, road surface, winds, etc. could all affect cooling,
for example.

OTOH, the instructor might be more interested in your methods than in your
scientific rigor.  The only way to find out is to talk it over with your
instructor.  It's likely that the instructor will be receptive, as I can
say from long experience that the same old projects get boooorrrriiingg.
