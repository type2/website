Subject: Favourite year/ least favourite year Friday post 

I am just finishing of the restoration of a 1967 Sliding door Samba from a 
bare shell. I was thinking of all the hassles of having a 67 year model, 
finding a 12volt wiper motor, etc. And with it having a sliding door finding 
a popout window latch, etc., etc. So what is everybody's favourite year and 
least favourite year and why? Mike
