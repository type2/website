Ah - little problem didn't do that on the one I have fitted already.  Just
went back to it and tried lifting it and it did not seem to move - however I
have refitted the spring plate cover.  Should I pop this back off to check?
I assume this would restrict movement.

Er I don't really want to cut anything - oh perhaps you are sneakily trying
to tell me to change the angle to 0 degrees and cut the wheel arches out so
I can drag along the floor and look as kewl as hell!!!!!  lol!!

Thanks for your help!
