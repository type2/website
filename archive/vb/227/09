Maybe the term necessary instead of beneficial would be better.
It is a major design change cosmetically as well a structurally.

The air in the engine bay is always going to be at a lower pressure.
Whether the restriction of the vents is significant would really need to
be either calculated or measured. What you seem to want to state as fact
is just conjecture on your part. Of course you could be right , or not.

And if the scooped shape of the bay intakes actually increases pressure
and/or fan efficacy also needs to be backed up with hard evidence.

Wild guess stated as fact. We have no way to know how much of the design
was determined by engine cooling or mechanical design or aestetics
considerations.

Opinion yes well stated. Although since the bay window has so many changes
obviously unrelated to cooling I would suspect that the loaf was based
more on some perception of marketability and the feeling that they needed
a change. They could have more easily added high intakes to the existing
design.

You could easily test this theory by cutting some more holes in the side
of your bus.

I disagree with your original premise that their is necessarily a
restriction at the vents.
As far as the pulley ratio. Empirical evidence tells me you are not quite
right. My ratio with stock parts was 1.6:1 Its been written by some fairly
experienced listees that it should be closer to 2:1. I dont know why some
stock setups could yield that ratio. AFAIK my lower pulley is the larger
size and Ive never heard of various sizes of VW gen pulleys. At any rate
for ME the porsche pulley got my ratio to 2.2:1 and it seems to make a
considerable difference in cooling and an unnoticable difference in power.

I also am not comfortable with oil coolers.

FWIW

peace
