Subject: RE: [VB] side scoops any opinions

what is needed for the non-front-tin  hypoth is a bit of 
experimentation... someone needs to drive their bus WITH the front 
tin for a week and measure temps (guage, laser pointer, whatever) and 
then do the same WITHOUT the tin, but all the mods to help (debris 
screen, ducting the cooler exhaust, etc).  same bus, same load, same 
seals, same gas, same roads, same measuring tools, hopefully same 
weather.
personally, i think something alongthe lines of a ram scoop under the 
front bumper and ducted to this tin would be better....  berg and 
others did this to beetles (think gene also punched holes in hs bus 
to test airflow theories - NOT a vintage perv, that guy!)
