It seems like it.  The air requirement is quoted at the same rpm as
the maximum DIN hp number.  The cruising speeds are usually lower,
though.  For the 1200 and early 1500, the cruising speeds are quoted
at 3620 rpm, and for the late 1500 they are quoted at 4040 rpm.

I was looking in the '63-'67 Bentley in section T.  Page 139 of the
'70 "Without Guesswork" at the doc project has a pretty good collection
of engines and top speeds.

I don't think WG quotes the cooling air requirements of the car engines,
but they do mention it for industrial engines (page 7).  It varies from
500 L/sec for the early 1200s to 565 L/sec for the later 1600s.

I seem to recall reading somewhere that part of the reason for the
outie to innie change was for safety.  Not for people riding in the
Bus, but pedestrians, cyclists, etc that might get run over by the
Bus.  The idea was apparently to minimize sharp and pointy things
on the outside of the body that might injure people in an accident.
Hence, innie vents, door handles that don't flip out, etc.
