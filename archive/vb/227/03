I'll tell you another one that gave me pause. A friend of mine years ago
hooked up a pair of internal scoops, aluminum dryer hose, and a bug vent fan
and tried forcing more cooling air to the fan shroud. He could actually see
the head and oil temp drop on his dash when he cranked up the speed on the
fan. A little too busy in the engine compartment for me!

I'll measure the scoops tonite & check. I'll make the assumption that
the airflow tends to follow the contour of the bus by the time it gets
near the rear of the bus. The rearmost portion of the air vent is
farther out than the front. While it might be at a slight angle this
is still a free area for air to travel in when measured perpendicular
to the bus body. So there is some sort of scoop action there. Whether
or not the airflow is there to take advantage of a forced air effect
or not, I sure don't know. But I would suggest if it doesn't exist
then it wouldn't exist on the split scoops either. Just for reference
I am comparing my 66 with my 79. I'll see if I can get a rough
estimate of the actual free area from these by measuring. Then again
it's not like it suddenly makes the split scoops look better. (;
