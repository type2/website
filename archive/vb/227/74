I hope these work for you guys...  Just let me know if you cannot see them 
in the link (if not probably a permissions issue).

Muffler still awesome!

On a side note I did get some headlight relays (at the local VWFLAPS)and 
will hopefully get that done tonight.  Wiring is a pain!  Ordered some SPDT 
relays for the Matt 9-Pin conversion and waiting to get those.

Spring is here and the projects stack up quick!  I stayed up until 1:30AM 
working on that beast, no dinner or anything - well a few beers :)  Also I 
blew up the RF Punch 60 amp by being a moron and tired and hocked the power 
wires up backwards like a dope... Smoke... Burned power supply :(  I swear I 
am not 16, honest!
