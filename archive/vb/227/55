It would depend upon the volume of water used.  A better place for the
mist nozzle is right at the fan inlet, not in the scoops.

I remember that there are some RV cooling systems that
spray water on the radiator, to prevent overheating on hills.  Works
great, as long as you have a lot of water to spray.  Since water is low
cost and they can carry a lot of it the idea works out.

I'd say, that if you want a functional scoop, it has to extend at least 4"
from the side of the bus, to get outside of the turbulent flow layer.  The
best design would probably look like a set of Mickey Mouse ears sticking a
foot out into the airflow.
