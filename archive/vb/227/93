Subject: RE: [VB] Shift rod bushes

I cleaned mine with 10 guage shotgun brushes on long rod, sealed in
heatshrink tubing/electrical tape. Then I painted it with swabs. Then I
greased it with new swabs.
Cheap, and easy. The power drill ran the brush rods to sand. I suppose if it
were real bad you could try swabbing POR in there, uncertain of thickness vs
action. Maybe EASTWOOD RUST ENCAP?
Wishing you luck on broken rod removal...
