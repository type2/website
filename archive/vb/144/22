Sorry I have a few more lock questions for my 66!

I bought a NOS engine lid lock and handle, but when it arrived it was =
not quite what I was expecting.  It came with keys, but it is a single =
sided lock.  The part number of the actual lock and latch is 113 827 =
503.  The one that is currently fitted to my bus is from a 67 and has =
the part no 113 827 503E/F.

As it is a single sided lock I won't be able to make this key work with =
the rest of my keys, and it doesn't appear to come apart anyway.

Looking at the vintage bus website it appears that there are two =
lock/latches for a 66 bus, 113 827 503 and 113 827 503A

Does anyone know if the part 113 827 503A is different to the part I =
have, ie if I got hold of one would I be able to make it match the other =
locks on my bus?

Another question is about the ignition lock, mine is a Austin Mini one =
(why????) so I need to get one of these.  The part is 211 905 811C =
according to vintagebus, this has to be a different key does it not?

Thanks
Paul
