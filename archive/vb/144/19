Huh?  "Mit Ihm fahrt der Erfolg" and pictures of how many crates you
could stuff in a Bus didn't seem to be selling a cult object to me.

The New Beetle, even though it's a Golf in a Beetle suit, is "cute"
(this can be good or bad) but looks reasonably like a real Beetle.
The "New Bus" is just fugly.  IMHO it's uglier than the 411.

>Now if they would only support the ones that created  "THE CULT"

They need to do something.  Googling around finds that VW's US
market share was 5% in 1960.  In 1998 (before NB launch) it was
less than 1%.  For 2001 it was 2.1%.

PS I think Thom was objecting to the implied Porsche reference...
