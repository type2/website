Subject: Thumper still for sale

All right, 
there is no further use in putting this off. Thumper, my 1967 SC with the
1600DP engine is for sale. I have new rockers and jack points, a replacement
drivers side floor piece to go with the welded in passenger side. None of
the metal is welded in yet because of other rust issues to be dealt with
first. There is eight tires and wheels, four of which are white powder
coated, four are brown. Custom aluminum roof rack and ladder and car cover.
All four brake lines have been replaced as well as the front brake shoes and
wheel cylinders. I have a set of new shoes for the rear. The drag link has
been replaced and I have four new tie rod ends that go with the truck. The
original door and ceiling panels are removed but I still have them, was
going to wet them, press them, and recover them in the future. I have plenty
of pictures and it can be viewed at:

Even though I put a bunch of money into it with the powder coated bumpers
and new engine, I am going to let it go for what I paid for it, $3000. My
moms cancer forces the sale of a lot of my beloved things. Maybe sometime in
the future I can get another truck.
