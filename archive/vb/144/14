It's a long, thin piece of steel that is folded over into a U shape.
The legs of the U go through a hole and are bent outwards to hold
the pin in place.  A cotter pin is usually used on a shaft or axle
to keep a nut from coming lose.

http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5054part/170.jpg has a picture
of how it is used on a Bus.  The pin is number 17.  There is a hole
drilled in the axle (number 15) for the pin to go through.  It keeps
the nut (number 16) from coming off the axle.=20

has a photograph and a drawing.  In the drawing, the cotter pin is red.=20

That's OK, my knowledge of Portugese technical terms is even worse.
:)  EuroDicAutom at http://europa.eu.int/eurodicautom/login.jsp
suggests "tro=E7o", "perno", "cavilha ranhurada", "pino ranhurado", or
"perno ranhurado" as possible Portugese translations.
