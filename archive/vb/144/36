Mosaic Ihave in my 15 window Deluxe. I cannot see any difference between the 
2. Did the Mosaic come from Westfalia for a dealer install? <<

The SO-34 & 35 are the same kit the SO-34 has white formica cabinets and the 
35 has wood venier.  The rear cabinets of both of these take up both sides of 
the rear all the way forward to where the rear seat/bed would be just behind 
the rear cargo door opening in the SO-34, SO-42, and SO-44 Westies.  These 
cabinets are much deeper than any other cabinet sets so as to only allow a 
single flip up seat between them where the later rear seat/bed would be.  The 
mid seat in the SO-34 & 35s is sideways to any other bus cargo bay seats so 
as to have the up to three passengers on this facing/look out the cargo 
doors.
  Mosaic SO-33 interiors were definitely a dealer option/accessory one could 
order and install in thier Kombi or other type bus or could be ordered to 
come in a Westie body.  The SO-34 & 35 interiors are screwed into place, the 
SO-33 was designed to quickly unlatch/fold up and out of the bus/Westie in a 
very short time.
