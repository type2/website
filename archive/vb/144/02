It's friday so here's a good one. A fellow here in Havasu is liquidating a
private car collection for the women in the bitter half of a divorce. Court
said ALL MUST GO. Here is a partial list of whats there. I allready have my
name on all the pre 67 VW's and 1 50's surburban. But the rest is up for
grabs. Prices should be fair till the vultures arrive
 
ronnie   see below!
 
I just got the list of titled vehicals and there are 3 times more without
titles
I think there is over 600 total, these are all complete unmolested, out of
over 20 years collecting!!
Location still a secret

If every buskatier bought a vintage car or truck we couldn't put a dent in
whats there. I'm ready to go back there once the seller gets there. I will
keep all informed on whats up in case somebody wants something. I want to
fill a whole transport truck up with VW's and a suburban to bring back to az

there and check anything out for you?  I didn't know what was going on with
that.
