Subject: Re: [VB] Need <63 door handle 

I too would like to find a 63 type ignition switch.  61 to 63 to be precise, 
for my 61.  push on terminal.  I gave my last one to my dad to get rekeyed 
for his truck.  recently had a key fit and want one key for the 61.  or maybe 
I should just put the steering lock in and not worry about it.   I have a ton 
of L series ignitions, and some screw terminal 55-60 ignition switches, and 
some Ts (some have keys).

 Hi Richard,
 Driver exterior handle should be easy to find.  Check for Gabriel who does 
 lock work for VWs in the archives.

 That is going to be alot harder!  We could not find one of those in usable 
 condition for our 1963 SC and had to pull the NOS one we had on the shelf.  
 Probably was the last NOS one on the planet....
