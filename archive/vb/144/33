Hey Shawn,
Yeah, you probably want to go down on the venturis.  I'm running 28s in my
2L 914 engine.  You'll probably need to go down on jet sizes too.  The
smaller the venturi the more vacuum so it pulls more fuel through.  I'm
running 115 mains on mine right now, these are weber 40IDFs though.  I may
need to go leaner but I'm at some altitude.  Smaller venturis give better
low end torque, depending on what cam you have.
I tried running 34 venturis on my 2L type 1 engine with stock cam, 1.4
ratio rockers and it was a dog using 42DCNFs.
