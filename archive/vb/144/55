Right.  1 August 1962 was the start of the '63 model year.  I was
also generalizing to "1 August"; some years it was as late as 3 or
4 August depending on the calendar.

Looking at it, I got the seat right but I screwed up the wheel
arches.  I said split seat and flat arches for the '63 models;
it should have been split seat and lipped arches for '63.
