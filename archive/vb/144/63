I am trying to get my semaphores hooked up but can't find out  where the 
wiring runs to and from. Like where it comes out at etc..  I was able to get 
one open and will be able to remove it, the other seems stuck and I don't 
want to be to forceful.   Is it natural to have to use force?  Heck I want 
them to work when I am done as well.  The vehicle in question is a 1959 
panel...Any help out there......
