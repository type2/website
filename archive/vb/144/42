Hi Ronnie,
Youi are welcome!  Would be nice to have the Mcode plate codes from those!  
Though the codes on Westies are not always exactly accurate.  There are a few 
very early (1961) SO-34 that have a 23 instead of 34 Westie code on thier 
Mcode plate!  We think the SO-33s started late 62 or early 63 so the same 
Mcode slip up may have happened early on.  We have seen an all original SO-33 
Westie hatchtop with its ice box AKA frig.  Have also seen a complete SO-33 
interior for sale at our Vintage show years ago that had the same ice box, 
but it actually had a propane powered cooling system built into it.  The 
SO-33 also has the front/rear facing pair of 2/3 seats that convert with the 
table into the camping bed.  The SO-34 & 35s convert the side facing seat 
into the bed with the two visable cushions and one stored under the back 
cushion.

As far as we know all SO-34 & 35s came with the front bench seat that has the 
upper section flip over so volks can sit there facing backwards when camping.

We do have a small website about SO-34 & 35 Westies you can take a look at:
