Hate that! also sucks when its a part and you've put money/time into packing
the item only to be left without payment. Not as financialy damaging but
still annoying is the guy who calls repeatedly asking the same questions
about a part/vehicle, or things like "so this other guy has a double cab for
$XXXX is that a good deal?"
