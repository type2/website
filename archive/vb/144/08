Hi Richard,
Driver exterior handle should be easy to find.  Check for Gabriel who does 
lock work for VWs in the archives.

That is going to be alot harder!  We could not find one of those in usable

Probably was the last NOS one on the planet....

Gabriel can do that and he knows how to repin the tool bay door/s for SCs.
