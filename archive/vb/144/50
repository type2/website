Ronnie, where did you get a connection to VWoA's BS pipeline?  I
looked around their site a bit and couldn't find the Fake Microbus
press.

I own a (non-VW) new car.  It does have one thing in common with most
air-cooled VWs: the factory specifies different tire pressures front
and rear.  The first five regular maintenance services came as freebies
with the car.  At the first maintenance that included a tire rotation,
I even mentioned the air pressure difference to the service writer.
One "factory certified technician" later, the air pressure in my tires
was exactly the reverse of what the factory specifies.

I think I would take my Bus to a shop if it looked like the ones in
the Bentley manaul -- spotless ceramic tile on the floor and walls,
and men with shirts, ties, and overcoats working on cars.  Of course,
they'd be using gasoline as a generic parts-washing solvent and
wearing asbestos-lined gloves to do welding, too...
