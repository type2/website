Subject: RE: [VB] Middle seat question


Gang:

I have this same issue.  A long time ago a body shop made my floor, when
they welded in new metal.  It looks and works great (can't tell it is not
stock) except for the fact it has no seat mounts.  Do I have to buy a new
floor?  Do those new metal floors have the right seat brackets for my 55?

Volks,

...Would it be practical to get some from Wolfsburg West and have the dude
weld them in?...
