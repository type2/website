Hi Jdd,
Would be nice to know what the compression is now after the diesel treatment. 
 If we remember correctly if you run another compression test for a new 
baseline and then squirt some oil into the spark plug holes and run another 
compression test.  If the compression in a cylinder goes way up you have bad 
rings.  If it does not go up the valves/valve seat/s are then suspect.

  So last weekend I adjusted the valves again because I was trying to keep an 
eye

Halfway through the arc of the rocker arms pushing the valves are the 
adjusting studs in parallel to the valve stems?  If not the valve guides will 
wear out sooner to too much side thrust pressure.  Just guessing your 
pushrods might be too short or even too long for your engine and thusly might 
be partly the reason your #3 cylinder valve running out of adjustment.

 So, I figured I'd take the heads to someone who knows about things like that

You might want to get one of those CB oil filter/pumps which do need a cut 
and rewelding at a different angle the neck and slight redrilling through the 
oil passages between the pump cover and where the oil filter threads on to 
function with a stock muffler with its left heat riser tube on the front of 
the muffler.  This will clean the motor, oil cooler and help extend the life 
of the engine bearings.  30 MPG (IMP) (-at-) 55 MPH (-at-) 3,000 RPM is great for a 40 
HP mystery motor.
