Subject: HCBF pix request

During HCBF a few friends and I got together for a fighter=20
practise.  Towards the end, we did what we call "whack a knight", where we=
=20
let kids take their best shots at us.  I know a few of you good folks took=
=20
pictures of that as well.  Could you please forward me copies so I=20
can  send them on?

Thank you all very much
