Subject: Jess Update... positive news but still serious 

A number of folks received an email update from Melissa as of 13:30hrs
12/16/2003. I will spare the details for the lists' sake and for family
privacy.

Generally, Jerry had a very rough day on Monday and was at least healthy enough
to be momentarily sitting up and eating some form of breakfast when Mrs. Jess
arrived this AM. He is not out of the woods yet, remains in the ICU and has
some serious health issues that will not be cleared up over night.

I checked with the hospital this AM and, at least for the moment, flowers are
not encouraged. A card, an extra prayer or kind email will suffice to let the
family know that you care. Send well wishes to: vwstuff53(-at-)msn.com if you are so
inclined. Personal friends already have the business address.

The Jess' mailing/business address will not be posted to this list (by
myself)at this time. I have not cleared that with Melissa.

Feel free to email myself or any of the many fans of Jerry and Melissa. I am
not attempting to be the de facto point of contact. Far from it. My intention
was only to ask for an extra thought or two when a good friend of the VW world
was in serious need.
Best wishes to all,
Jim Ellis
