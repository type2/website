Craig,
you said you're running a cam with a basically stock setup?  I can't say I 
have a lot of experience with VW motors as far as hotrodding them, but it's 
my understanding that changing the cam is the last thing to change, only 
after the fuel delivery system and exhaust system have been upgraded to 
match.  Also, valve overlap is used to keep the exhaust valves cool, 1 
degree on the stock cam.  If the cam you are using has more overlap then by 
defenition there would be more unburnt fuel in the exhaust.

My second thought would be first to idle up, as someone else suggested, and 
second, maybe consider an Autocraft or Petronix electronic ignition setup, 
and a hotter coil.  Last, the head temps seem to suggest running too lean.

Last, I don't think I've ever heard any reccomendation other than running 
premium fuel.  As the compression ratio isn't that high, I would assume that 
it is a result of head temps of an air cooled motor predisposing it to 
detonation.  I'm sure someone will let me know if I'm off the mark on this.

Please note that this is speculation, and, as stated before, not based on a 
huge amount of experience with the motor.

JT
