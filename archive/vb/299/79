Hi Lee,
Then check for how much voltage is getting to the coil and the wire going 
back to the starter solinoid.  If you find any droppage more than about 1/2 volt 
you need to clean and tighten all the electrical connections and solder all 
rivets areas in the electrical system.  Once we had a simular problem and it 
turned out to be the #1 male electrical tab where it was riveted to the coil 
terminal had loosened.
