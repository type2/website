Tristar Synchro Dbl Cab~

It just needs front and rear bullbars with electric winch(es), roofrack with
all kinds of Off-road KC lights, highly efficient airconditioning, an
XM-Sirrus
stereo sound system and a rear roofheight tilt/canvas.
 
If time permits, repaint it that NewBeetle blue with military aircraft AH64
style flat paint on the rockers and slightly higher.
