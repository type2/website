Subject: far-out wire trip

hey people,
   i was re wireing my turn signal switch today and noticed i have one wire left over, one of the tan ones. where does it go? i had to sodder a couple of wires cause they broke off. also, my emergency flashers dont work, but my turn signals do. and my headlights and reverse lights dont work either, does my bus have to be on for them to work? thanks in advance.
