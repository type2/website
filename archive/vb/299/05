Hi Josh,
Best to go to vintagebus.com and check out the color wiring diagrams there!  
Brown or tan should be a ground wire.  The 1967 switches have two, one to the 
dimmer/flasher relay, and the other to the wiper switch.  There is a # code on 
the turn switch to tell you which of each of these ground wires goes to.
