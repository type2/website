ok, so here's the rub: my tailpipe is pretty black, AND my afm 
consistently shows me running just a bit richer than necessary at 
speed... tho the idle mix will go full lean after the throttle is let 
up and takes some time to get back to the 'middle' range.

like i said, i haven't found a MASSIVE vacuum leak despite shooting 
enough aquanet to bouffant cleveland, but that doesn't rule out a 
small one that i may have missed.  as for the carb being screwy - 
new, and it drives ok; only complaint being that it doesn't like to 
go more than 60 or so, and i start to get cyl head temps higher than 
i like (375)at that speed. i also found the engine speed and mix 
screws needed to be quite far out to get a nice idle and remove 
hesitation off idle.

my assumption is that i still need to find the right jet combo - but 
meantime, i just need to find enough tweaks to pass emissions :P
