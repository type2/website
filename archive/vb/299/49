Last year was one time that I was glad that I slept in at a bus show =)  The pics were nightmarish enough, I couldn't imagine seeing it in real life.  

I also can't even contemplate what is gonna happen this year...

Also, just in case any listees are interested.  A caravan will be leaving my place in Murrieta/Temecula on Friday morning to head to Havasu.  It will be mostly SV2's members with a listee or two.  Our route will be the I215 to I10 then out on Hwy 62 to Parker, AZ.  We will be meeting up with people along the way in 29 Palms. The more the merrier, p-mail me if interested.
