Subject: King Pin rebuild help is needed...

Hi I am interested in rebuilding my king pins on my
bus. I have a 20 ton hydraulic press and see in my
bently there is some neet jigs for taking the king pin
spindles apart. 

I am sure I can fabricate something similar but would
love some ideas or even better specifications off some
originals or something other folks use. 

Heck or if you have the original jigs 460-461 I recall
I would just buy em too!... 

Any help appreciated
