That one looks pretty decent for home made, and looks
well loved.

If anyone is interested, pics of the factory VW tools
are here:

There is a pic of the reamer for the bushings, the
"taker-aparter" tool for pressing them apart (VW460),
and the jig with various spacers (some are factory,
others I had made for various linkpins) for pressing
them back together in alignmentand that is tool
VW461/1.
