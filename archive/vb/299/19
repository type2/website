My problem is with the engine tin and thermostat.  The chrome doghouse fan

thermostat.  
Hi Rob,
Chrome and not fitting correctly sounds like aftermarket junk, which could in 
turn mean not having the directional fins inside to direct the cooling air 
properly!!  Nasty!

We tried Ebay with "VW fan shroud" and got four hits.  This one:

is stock, looks good and even has the stock flaps, cross linkage and right 
now is only $15.00!  Then all you would need is the thermostatic bellows, the 
bracket it mounts in and the rod that connects the thermostat to the right 
flaps.  Shipping probably will be about $30.00 due to size not wieght.
