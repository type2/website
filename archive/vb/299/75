Subject: RE: [VB] King Pin rebuild help is needed...

I'll get a picture of the tool this weekend.
Unfortunately I don't I have a spindle off
at the moment or I could pose it in the press with tool.

I just press em together by pressing the top king
pin down.  The factory tool has this alignment guide
thingo but Ive never had any trouble visually aligning them
and then just pressing em together.  You just have to make
sure the annular bit cut out of the king pin for the retaining
bolt aligns with the annular bit in the spindle the bolt goes through.  
If the retaining bolt pushes in smoothly you're aligned.
