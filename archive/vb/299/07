Hi Craig,
Slather on some glycerin onto the rubber and let it set for at least 30 
minutes.  Then wipe off the excess glycerin and enjoy the softer more flexible OG 
rubber!  Repeat once or twice a year to keep it that way.  Glycerin is 
availible at any drugstore or chemist as those in the UK would say.
