You're not connecting manifold vacuum to your distributor are you? If so,
it's connected wrong. The only time a balance tube should be used is when
you have dual single barrel carbs, which should not be connected to the
distributor.

You want your vacuum port to be exposed only when the throttle is cracked
open, which can only be done by tapping into the carb.
