In electronics BLACK is ground and brown is soft ground or analog
ground. In AC like house wiring, Black is hot, White is neutral or
return, and green is ground for 110 VAC. Black and Red is hot for 220
and Black, Red, and Yellow is hot for three phase with white as return
and green as ground. Actually, white is attached to the ground bus when
it gets back to the breaker box anyway!

Sorry, I know, too much information.

My dad would say, "Brown is ground the whole world round."   which is
what he
learned.   It works for the Bosch wiring cars.

But evidently the US wiring folks never heard it....
does this meean the US is not on the round world?
