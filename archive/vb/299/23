guys-

a small story, and perhaps info that you guys can use as well...

frustration:

I do a bunch of business on the net. Buying and selling parts and cars for years now, domestically and internationally. i have not had any problems until recently , and for just $38.50.

i had emailed, and sent money for 2 pre-58 type 2 license lenses close to 6 months ago to somebody known as DVD on thesamba. there was a little communication via email in the beginning, and then nothing in the mail,  I had to hassle to get any kind of communication after feeling like nothing was going to happen...

"its coming, i'll send you one next week, this and that"...then nothing..still no lenses or a refund.

every now and then me sending emails reminding, asking, and left to wonder...with the ad still on thesamba.( as of a week ago or so)

someone had mentioned that he had not had any trouble with David at swap meets, and was curious about this story of mine...

I hate to use the forum, and i don't bad mouth anybody, but this instance is beyond being patient, and forgiving of time, other responsibilites of the seller, i am more than flexible, and understanding, but again there really is not an excuse... to ship a small package from cali to VA, its really that hard??

has anybody else had issues with this individual? no phone numbers were ever posted, just emails:
nosparts(-at-)hotmail.com, nosparts.vw(-at-)verizon.net...

thanks for listening
robert
56 DD panel...which still needs a license lens...
