Subject: [VB] search function page and distributor questions

Hi List -

1) I tried to do a search for "009" and "010" and "050" for info on my question but got nothing for any numbers, what gives? Searching for "distributor" and "dizzy || dissy" works but not numbers.

2) _sigh_ I know this is the seminal & annoying question but:
I have a single port heads on a AS21 brasilian case engine of unknown origin w/ a new 30/31 pict and a 009
The 009 has the hestitation blues but works great when running the engine like an industrial machine ( under load > 200 rpms etc ).  I want to try another dizzy, what models can I try?

thanks 
rob
