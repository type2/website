Subject: Re: [VB] heat exchangers vs J tubes

Hi Nick,
Several years ago on our way through Redding CA we stopped in at Bus Boys and 
Wolfgang Int. shops.  Steve the owner of Wolfgang Int. gave us a great tour 
of the place and talked to us for quite a while.  One of the topics we 
discussed was the cheapie Dansk heat exchangers.  Steve had them for sale in his shop 
and we told him our dislike for them.  Steve told us he had serious engine 
overheating problems with the cheapie Dansk and not the old German stock heat 
exchangers in his 2 to 2.2 liter VW engines he built for his own use!  He was 
interested in the fact that the German stock heat exchangers had inner and outer 
fins and we showed him these inner fins in a heat exchanger in his shop.  The 
inner finned areas of these heat exchangers is alot bigger diameter than the 
inlet and outlets of the heat exchangers and even the area between the tips of 
the fins is as big if not bigger!  So the fins themselfs are not going to 
cause alot of drag to the exhaust gases and in turn help cool which in turn 
condenses the exhaust gases causing less pressure back pressure agaist the 
heads/exhaust valves.  
  We have seen some volks up here modify stale air 40 HP lower engine tin and 
weld in much larger exhaust J-tubing through this to match thier extractor 
tubing size for thier larger liter engines so they have heat in thier VWs.
  Brazing it not such a good idea because the heat exchanger tubes reach such 
a high temp that the brass will soften if not outright melt.
