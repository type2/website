Wouldn't it depend on how it was attached?  That is - if the force is
applied to the rail at close to the top and the force is horizontal to the
earth then wouldn't the chance of bending be quite high?  But - if the force
were to be applied at the bottom of the drip rail and in a vertical
direction wouldn't it be very difficult to bend the drip rail?
