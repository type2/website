Oh, another thing that has caught me in the past was changing heads to
aftermarket heads with long reach plug holes. Here ya got short plugs
firing way up the spark plug hole away from the main flame wall. You can
make it run semi good, but it's not right and will cause a lot of
problems short term.

Sounds like a rich idle condition or else a misfire.

If it's a rich idle, all you need to do is lean it out, perhaps 50RPM on
the lean side of idle.  Run the idle speed as high as you can get away
with, say 975RPM

If it's a misfire, put in fresh plugs.
