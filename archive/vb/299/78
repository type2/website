Subject: '57 Crank handle dimensions please

Hi all,

A partularly cold night last night mean the '57 just would not start on 
the (new) 6v battery, plenty of turn over, but just wouldn't catch - but 
when we towed the bus just a few meters and dropped the clutch it 
started up no problem!  So I guess it's time to make a crank handle for 
such times, can anyone give me rough dimensions so I can make one - I 
already have the nut so the handle's the easy bit.

thanks

Lee '57 samba
