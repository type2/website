Subject: [VB] thermostat/engine tin needed?

hello list -

 my 64 standard came with a engine of unkown quality/origin. It is an AS21 case with single port heads a new 30/31 pict and an 009.  According to PO it has rebuilt heads ( compression is good! ).

 My problem is with the engine tin and thermostat.  The chrome doghouse fan shroud does not fit the engine tin very well and it does not have the flaps or a thermostat.  

 I live in a cold climate and want to know what my options are for getting a thermostat.  I know that getting good engine tin is a problem, so I was wondering what people suggest.  I do not really have time to look for used engine tin.  I fear that not warming up correctly and possibly not cooling correcty will do the engine in too quickly.  Any suggestions?  Sorry if the problem is too vague but.. 

 thanks

 rob
