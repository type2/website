Subject: Ken Hoopers email addy?

Sorry All,

I was wondering if someone could tell me Ken Hooper's
current email addy?

Thanks

RobK

p.s. for some bus content here's few more pix of my
crusty twin cab progress.  Got the subfloor in (does need
to be cleaned up a bit) and fitted
a gas overflow tube..
