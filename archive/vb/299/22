I guess the lesson is that it's a global market now. Splitty
buses have had almost zero value in this country for years,
and there were a lot of comparatively rust-free buses
around. Now the poms have discovered SA buses and they are
busy ransacking the country for every splitty they can lay
their hands on, with at least three UK-based websites now
boasting SA buses for sale.

The result, of course, is that splitties locally are about
to increase in value radically, to levels approaching the
ridiculous prices that the poms are prepared to pay, and
thus dictate the market value. It's not all bad news,
though, as it means that the buses in my collection are
appreciating hugely. You can be sure that next time I sell a
splitty, it will be priced accordingly.

OK, that's the end of that rant. I'll make another report
once I've made some headway stripping the scrap buses.

Its always been a global market, were VWs made in Germany, Ireland, South 
Africa, Brazil, and Mexico. And if it wasn't for a pom Major an Austrian Nazi and 
a Belgium there wouldn't be a Volkswagen. Also wasn't your Dormobile from 
England? Now I must go and have a lie down I have had a busy day ransacking. Mike
