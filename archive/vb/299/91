The best vac dizzy as far as I'm concerned is the SVDA. You can run a
balance line between your dual carbs at the top of each manifold if
there isn't a vac line on the carb. I've run Dual 34 PICT 3 CB
Performance setup, Dual Baby Dells, and Kadrons with success and good
response and mileage.

conclusion ?

You can run vacuum advance with dual carbs, just make sure your signal
is pulling from two cylinders. Dual carbs seem to do a bit better than a
single carb with a centrifugel only distributor. Kad's really respond
well to running vacuum advance. The carbs have to be modified for this
though.
