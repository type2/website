Subject: brown is ground the whole world round Re: [VB] Wiper Switch ?

My dad would say, "Brown is ground the whole world round."   which is what he 
learned.   It works for the Bosch wiring cars.

But evidently the US wiring folks never heard it....  
does this meean the US is not on the round world?

As for the other terminals, one should be low speed, the next high speed and 
the last is a constantly on to allow the wipers to park.
