Craig,
	Try retarding the ignition timing on your engine before retesting.  
I'd shoot for 7* or less at idle.  The stock dual can vacuum advance 
distributor retards the timing at idle to 5* ATDC!  The single can dizzy 
in my '74 Super runs well at the stock timing for that distributor, 0* 
or TDC at idle.... This will help lower the HC emissions, I hope? Of 
course, remember to retime the thing after the test.    Gary Gibson
