Subject: [VB] King Pin rebuild help is needed...


Hi I am interested in rebuilding my king pins on my
bus. I have a 20 ton hydraulic press and see in my
bently there is some neet jigs for taking the king pin
spindles apart.

I am sure I can fabricate something similar but would
love some ideas or even better specifications off some originals or
something other folks use.

Heck or if you have the original jigs 460-461 I recall
I would just buy em too!...

Any help appreciated
