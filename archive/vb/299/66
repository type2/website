Subject: Re: [VB] emissions failure - advice? > No fourth gear during

OK, call me whacky call me stupid (it's happened before) ;-) but I was given a
tip back when I had to emission test the dual Del Ortto 40 1776 1967 Westy.

I used to fail at an emissions place in the eastern part of Phoenix only to
turn around and pass everytime that I took the same bus to the emissions
station in North Phoenix in which a bunch of aircooled VW lovers work. (Phoenix
residents note that it's on 26th Ave, South of Peoria Ave, on the East side of
"the freeway" across from Metro Center Mall.

The trick as I was told was to tell the testing monkey NOT to shift the bus
into 4th gear if you have to do a roller/driving at speed simulation. "You will
fail every time!" the guy advised. Bogging in fourth gear in a vehicle driven
by someone unfamiliar with aircooled VWs is death on a stick according to the
fella. I believed him and always took the bus back to that location, mentioned
about the fourth gear thing and always passed there after.

See the first sentence of this post but it worked for me.
