 This is where you should post our complaint. You can also do a search for
positive or negitive post about DVD.

  I am sure some of DVD's friends have saw your post and have informed him
of your complaint.

guys-

a small story, and perhaps info that you guys can use as well...

frustration:

I do a bunch of business on the net. Buying and selling parts and cars for
years now, domestically and internationally. i have not had any problems
until recently , and for just $38.50.

i had emailed, and sent money for 2 pre-58 type 2 license lenses close to 6
months ago to somebody known as DVD on thesamba. there was a little
communication via email in the beginning, and then nothing in the mail,  I
had to hassle to get any kind of communication after feeling like nothing
was going to happen...

"its coming, i'll send you one next week, this and that"...then
nothing..still no lenses or a refund.

every now and then me sending emails reminding, asking, and left to
wonder...with the ad still on thesamba.( as of a week ago or so)

someone had mentioned that he had not had any trouble with David at swap
meets, and was curious about this story of mine...

I hate to use the forum, and i don't bad mouth anybody, but this instance is
beyond being patient, and forgiving of time, other responsibilites of the
seller, i am more than flexible, and understanding, but again there really
is not an excuse... to ship a small package from cali to VA, its really that
hard??

has anybody else had issues with this individual? no phone numbers were ever
posted, just emails:
nosparts(-at-)hotmail.com, nosparts.vw(-at-)verizon.net...

thanks for listening
robert
56 DD panel...which still needs a license lens...
