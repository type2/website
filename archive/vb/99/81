Subject: Any Kelly park updates ?

Just wondering if they figured out where the swap meet was going to be and if 
there is enough room for everyone in the swap ?

from the website 
http://www.ggcvvwca.org/kelleypark2002.htm

it looks like the swap is  back inside the park , and thats not much room !

is that the  final decision ?
