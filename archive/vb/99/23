Have OG safaris in the 61.  Bought NOS seals 5? years ago.   They only seeped 
a drip in downpour at speed when new.  Now they do not  leak when sitting, 
but do leak when driving.  I alctually took the drivers side out and put a 
solid one in for the winter.   
Do post how the new seal work for you.

<< I've been running the stock safari seals on my original safar frames with
 the same leakage problems. Not really too big a deal, but in order to give
 them a break I just recieved some "new" technology safari seals from Japan.
 They have the same hollow "crush" tube as the original but on top of this
 tube is a small flat seal surface to go flush against the safari frames.
 Will see how they work out.....
