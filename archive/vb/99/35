from bus parts list: 63 edition updated through ?  section 6:

211 601 023A    wheel disc 3.5 D x16 
                - up to ch # 20-117 901

211 601 027E    wheel disc 4.5 K x 15
                -  from ch 20-117 902 up to  1 219 510

211 601 027F    wheel disc 5 JKx14
                up to chassis # 1 219 510                 M215
                from chassis # 1 219 511

so this says 15" rims were used on early 64s- before 1 219 511. (19 dec 63)   
The optional 1 ton 63s got the 14"s

for changes in 1 ton/ 3/4 ton look in the front spindle or reduction box 
section 
in section 5: rear axle: lets look at the stub axle
as there are nine kinds you all can look it up on that website,   or at the 
rear axle nut: 1 ton kind used from ch 1 144 281

so from 1 144 281 to 1 219 510 these early 64s were made with 1 ton 
suspension and 15" rims.   about 65,000 buses.   
 
the pull handle front door swapped to the push button front door at 1 222 026 
(18 dec 63), 
hm- 
FWIW the 15" tires used 6.40 - 15 tires with tubes, the 14" rims 700 - 14 
tubeless tires.

Ya- I have found that diff sources sometimes have slightly different dates 
for the same change.  i can find info for the same wheel change also for 1 
222 026 dec 19.  but still- about the same time.

 1 145 666 in July 1963?  That doesn't fit into the sequence of
 chassis numbers and dates I have.  Although, looking at the
 whole sequence, it isn't that consistent by itself:
  
 1 July  1 139 422
 
 4 Aug   1 145 027
 
 5 Aug   1 144 103   (1200)
 5 Aug   1 144 303   (1200)
 5 Aug   1 145 427   (1500)
 5 Aug   1 146 028   (1500)
 
 8 Aug   1 141 835   (1200)
 
 Taking these numbers at face value, they built about 5,600 Buses in
 the whole month of July, and then on 5 August were able to crank out
 1,900 more, which doesn't seem likely.
 
 I am starting to think that it might not be possible to nail down
 the 1200/1500/0.75 ton/1 ton changes accurately with the information
 that is now available to anyone.
 
 On your Bus, do the dates on the wheels approximately match the Bus?
 Are the front and rear suspensions original to the Bus?  Just curious.
