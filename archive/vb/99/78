Subject: Middle seat restoration - I NEED YOUR HELP PLEASE -

Hello I am in the process of restoring a middle seat for my 63. I am
planning on replacing the grab bar material along with the end caps. I can
repro the chrome end pieces easly enough but need to find the plactic tubing
for the bar. Does anyone have any leads on this? Or ideas on something close
to it?
If I have to I will be willing to buy a large role of it.

Anyone know of a restoration shop that has done this maybe?

A finders fee is available for the right info.

Thanks a million in advance
Shawn
