looks more like they have a fan blowing on the cooler, maybe sucking cool
outside air in. In any case looks like a doghouse cooler with the tin
removed-like someones attempt to improve the vw design. Like maybe they
didnt understand the original idea was to pressurize the engine compartment.
I'd put it back to stock, engine id should be on the gen pedestal, if its
missing probably a universal replacement case.

Hi there,

We are new to this list, and hope to learn more about air-cooled volkswagens
here .
We are Dutch and our English isn't very well.
So most of the time it will be difficult enough to understand what is
written.
But hey, you never know.
We own a 1955 Split Window.
We have a question about our oilcooler.
It seems like an electric blower is mounted on the oilcooler.
With an hot air outlet in the engine decklid.
Does anyone know more about this part? We never saw it before!
Pictures(not the best ones) from it are on our site. (see the heart of it)

Greetz,

Jan, Ans and the kids.
