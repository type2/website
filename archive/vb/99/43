Subject: Re: [VB] Early baywindow childs cot mods

Yeah, Beto, I altered a set of those rods to use in my
SO-42, and now use them in my SO-34, but I only had to
cut and weld the front one.  I just bent the rear one
slightly, and it was usable.  My canvas wasn't fit, so
I bought one for a split from Dawn at PLF (she's now
back in business and will be at Red Barn/Kelley Park),
so I can't answer the second part of your question,
but she could.  Pmail me for her phone number.
