According to the '58-'67 parts manual at the doc project, the exhaust
studs were originally 8 mm straight studs.  10mm-8mm step studs were
available as a service replacement.  Thomas, you might try a 10mm bolt
in the hole -- don't force it, but if the bolt fits better than the
8mm stud, then you can probably fix the problem with a step stud.
