Subject: Re: [VB] Sandblasting Prices

here in cali where everything is expensive, i got the lower bed of my single cab blasted (prices are from sept. 1999):

for $450 the inside of the bed area was sandblasted and given two coats of epoxy primer.  i saved myself some money by taking it out to the shop 45 miles away (subtract $200 in pick up and delivery) and pulling the engine, gas tank and taillights (subtract $100 in prep work).

if you are short on the money, house paint *really* protects from rust... ask jon about his hazet blue camper!

cheers,
