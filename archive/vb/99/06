Subject: Re: Cargo Door Rubber


There is a place in Phoenix that sells Cargo Door rubber,  a generic type of
automotive  door rubber, I think in grey----the cost is about $1.25 a foot
They also have the black rubber seal for your pop-top at around  $1.50 a
foot--works great for me and others that use it--,uj
