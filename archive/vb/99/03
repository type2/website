Hi Angel,
If it is a 1964-67standard RGBs or the one year 63 one ton RGBs you have 20% 
stonger brakes and less reduction gearing than what was used as a standard in 
1955-63.

That depends on the gearing of not only the RGBs but what gearing is in the 
tranny!  Buy or borrow a tach for a fifteen minute drive and write down where 
1,500 and 3,000 RPM are in each forward gear.
