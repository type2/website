Subject: Parts made overseas.  Looking for help

Does anyone have any experiance or contacts with any
overseas shops who reproduce some of our beloved Steel
VW bus parts?  Anyone know who is making (not selling)
the repro roof racks from China?

I have a non VW project i am working on and am looking
for some cheap ways to have some small lot parts made.
 Parts will require Steel turning, fabrication and
welding.

Thanks
Matthew
