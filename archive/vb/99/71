$1825?!?!?! Made me laugh!! I wonder if that bid is 
a bad joke? Geez, what is this world coming to?

Oh *DONT* get me started! ;-0!!!!
In theory someone could sell ten-twelve of these gems and "make" as much as
another theoretical person selling one unit that is nice but "high priced".
Most probably with more real profit.

During my childhood, my dear dead Daddy, the eternal Willie Lowman type
salesman, kept trying to teach me me as a child two lessons: 
Lesson 1: A quick nickel is better than a slow dime. 
Lesson 2: It's better to make money with someone else's money. 

I know the lessons, am endlessly am able to help others to follow them but
somehow don't follow them myself. <major sigh> See you all at Kelly Park.
