Yikes! Sounds like a nice one though.

But you can get a regular wood bed 16 or 18 ft. trailer and haul cars 
on it. Use a come-along to pull up the broken ones. Spend $35-$50 on 
safety chains or straps...or do like me and get someone you help haul 
a car for to buy them for you. My trailer is of local manufacture and 
is VERY stout. They take 'em seriously around here....same with 
pick-up trucks. I got used tires on mine and it cut down on the cost 
as well. Just some ideas to save $$$ unless you've got it to 
spend...then get a plush car hauler!

Yet another reason to move out of the city to the "sticks". Every day 
that goes by I look at the positives of living here and makes me 
never want to go back to the big city.
