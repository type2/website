Subject: crew cab headliner

Hi All,

I lucked out yesterday and found a complete (almost) original interior kit
from a 59 double cab for *the* 59 double cab.  The set is in fairly nice
condition but the only thing is it is missing the rear headliner piece.  So,
I would be very interested in finding one and would be willing to pay dearly
for it.

Also, the set I found has a little water damage on some of the pieces... has
anyone ever tried to steam and then straighten a panel before????  Also,
should the sheen of the panels be glossy or more of a mat finish?

My mind is racing with the now hopefully reachable goal of an
original/vintage interior... I had basically written that out of the picture
:-)
