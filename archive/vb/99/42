Subject: Re: [T2] braking with your engine?

Click & Clack had a thing about this and said that modern cars do not need to 
save the brakes by using the engine compression.
But I disagree, if you are going down a long hill. Engine compression braking 
is fine and if you have ever charged down a long hill and had you brakes fade 
you will always want to use engine compression.
Maybe a 200** car has the braking margin but I would not risk it.
When I worked for Henry F#(-at-)d in England, as a development engineer, during 
the 60's we did a test called 'Alpine brake test'; this was to accelerate as 
hard as possible to 60 mob and then slam on the brakes to a stop, then to 
accelerate then stop. We did this with comparison cars as well as things such 
as Lotus Cortinas. This was to simulate going down the Alps with a series of 
hairpin bends.
BTW if you want to get carsick, be an observer in the alpine brake test. Most 
cars brakes failed in short order, and the higher performance cars failed 
first because they had less time to cool off between brakings.


The moral is that if you do not have time to let the brakes cool between many 
applications they WILL fade.
