My M-code plate looks like this:
12 7
425
UA2113 131380 1145666

12 7 is euro day/month not US month/day, right?***
Rims are dated 6/63 and paint matches the bus which has not been
repainted.
The front beam is the 1-ton style, the steering dampener attaches to
the beam not the frame and I see no evidence of a dampener ever being
attached to the frame.
Is the transaxle original? How would I tell? The 3000 rpms in each
gear match up pretty close to the shift marks on the speedometer, so I
am guessing it is at least a stock bus unit. 3000 rpms in fourth gets
me about 55mph, tires are very close to stock size. 6V bellhousing, no
reverse light switch on the nosecone.
There is a bracket (tab with two bolt holes) on the driver's side of
the engine compartment to hang the oilbath aircleaner from. It is
original, not an add-on, same paint. I've seen such bracket on the
passenger's side of later busses, like the '67. Does this indicate
something about the original engine that was in there? The kind of
aircleaner on page 1 of section M30 in the bentley manual fits the
bracket, only on the driver's side. That's a 1500 aircleaner, did they
put this bracket on busses destined to be 1200, where the aircleaner
hangs off that hard-to-find triangular bracket on the fan shroud?

***Does anyone know what this date actually represents? How does it
relate to the date on which the VIN number assigned to the bus? Could
it be that my bus was completed on 12 July 63 and was required for
some purpose until maybe 5 August 63 when it was assigned a VIN and
shipped off to america? Perhaps it was built early to be photographed
for the color glossy dealer brochures featuring the new 1964
transporter line? I like that idea... Probably just got lost or didn't
work right, it's that kind of bus. What is the earliest bus with the
big rear hatch?

1 145 666 in July 1963?  That doesn't fit into the sequence of
chassis numbers and dates I have.  Although, looking at the
whole sequence, it isn't that consistent by itself:

1 July  1 139 422

4 Aug   1 145 027

5 Aug   1 144 103   (1200)
5 Aug   1 144 303   (1200)
5 Aug   1 145 427   (1500)
5 Aug   1 146 028   (1500)

8 Aug   1 141 835   (1200)

Taking these numbers at face value, they built about 5,600 Buses in
the whole month of July, and then on 5 August were able to crank out
1,900 more, which doesn't seem likely.

I am starting to think that it might not be possible to nail down
the 1200/1500/0.75 ton/1 ton changes accurately with the information
that is now available to anyone.

On your Bus, do the dates on the wheels approximately match the Bus?
Are the front and rear suspensions original to the Bus?  Just curious.
