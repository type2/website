Subject: Re: [T2] Minnesota VW swap meet???

Well, it has been firmly decided about the Twin Cities Volkswagen Club swap 
meet.  It's cancelled.  THe deal with the VW dealership in Saint Cloud fell 
through due to their remodelling and we could not find any where else.

Next on our list is where are we going to have our annual show.

frozen too!)
