Subject: [VB] Re: 15" Wheels

I thought 15"s were 5.5" wide.  Beetle wheels 4.5" wide.

I have a spare for my bus which is a 15" and it fits a 205/75/R15 just fine.

A buddy of mine runs 215/75/R15s on his sub-hatch westi with no problem.  A
Michelin XCX from NTB (can get them at Sears as well).  Big honkin' tires,
but they look cool and serve his needs very well. 

So in summary none of the bus 15s I have seen are 4.5" wide.  There is no
way they could possibly fit these large tires.
