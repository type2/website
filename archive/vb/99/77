Subject: 15" wheels

Adrian and whoever else cares,
I have about 20 15" bus rims here from all different dates and they are
all 4.5" wide. Someone posted it from the manual as well. So my guess is
you are running those big tires on that narrow of rim. It would just
depend on if anyone would speak up and say anything about it. If it
worries you I would double check the width. I am talking about 15" BUS
wheels, not bug wheels and not those wheels that were just posted from
eurocampers or gowesty or whichever that place was. The 205's will go on
but the manufactures claim that it pinches up the tread and is not a
safe situation. I am torn with who to believe. It seems like there are a
lot of you out there running them with no mishaps. I think I am going to
go for it and see how it does. I have not searched Coker tire but I have
friend that can get me tirerack tires at cost. So I am hoping to find
something there. There is nothing smaller than 205 within any kind of
load rating at all. The 195 Eurovan tires would be a little too small
circumference. I am leaning towards the Pirelli Scoprians in a
205/70/15. They are not quite as tall as stock but a good inch taller
than what I have been using. It comes down to putting to wide of tire on
too narrow of rim or putting something with really wimpy sidewalls on
the right size wheel. I even talked to Wilamette wheel here that makes
custom rims and they said they can't do the early bus rims because of
there not being enough surface areas to weld to. They remove the centers
and place them into a custom rim and weld them in. And to think
originally it was just great to cruise around on all bias plys and no
one gave it a second thought.
just being my usual over thinking self,
