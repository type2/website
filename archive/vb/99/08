I've been running the stock safari seals on my original safar frames with
the same leakage problems. Not really too big a deal, but in order to give
them a break I just recieved some "new" technology safari seals from Japan.
They have the same hollow "crush" tube as the original but on top of this
tube is a small flat seal surface to go flush against the safari frames.
Will see how they work out.....
