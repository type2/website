Subject: dual M/C brake upgrade- where does the "T" go?

I'm doing a dual circuit upgrade on my brakes for my '65. So of course 
I'm adding a "T" in the front to split the line from the M/C.  Where 
should the front "T" go?  Since its a '65 I'm guessing there's no hole 
for the T to be.  Anyone out there with a '67 that can tell me where its 
supposed to be on a '67?
