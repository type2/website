Chris-

I just put a new MC on my 67 and the line for the fronts goes up from the MC
a couple of inches and then turns to go back from the MC only about 4"
before it comes to the "T".  I do not believe the T is supported, but I did
not look that closely. If you like, let me know and I'll crawl under.

Bob
