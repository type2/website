Subject: Early baywindow childs cot mods

After having no luck in the archives....here goes...

I have an early bay childs cot (3 sided, galvanized poles....believe both poles are 56 1/4" long).  I hoping to make use of this cot in a splitty, and was hoping someone has done this mod before.

I know the poles would have to be trimmed to 55 1/4" and 47" to fit.  My question is in regards to the canvas:  Just by looking at the pole lengths, the canvas would have to be trimmed on the ends, or bunched up at the ends, but how does the width of the cot differ from a split cot (pole to pole).  

I'm hoping the canvas can be used without hanging too low between the poles...   

Anybody got a clue on what the hell I'm talkin bout here?

See y'all at BYOB,
