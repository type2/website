Yeah, it will be an interesting year at KP.  Honestly, after putting on
BYOB the day before (yall keep coming to BYOB if you dont want to do
KP), my fiancee and I will get up and out by 6am and if we make it into
the park, great.  If not, well park down below and wander in for a few
hours and then go spend the rest of the day on our own.  Thats just what
Ive opted to do...I will NOT get up at 3am to go sit in line for five
hours or more!
