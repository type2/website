Hey, this show is getting better and better by the day!!  We are adding much
to our Raffle, check out the list along with other details at:

http://www.mokanvwclub.org/bugblitz.html

Of course one of the fun things that will be happening will be the campout
Friday and Saturday nights.  The campout will be next to the show and will
have a couple of show awards for best camper and best camp display, so get
creative.  The campout will be on grass and after the gates close on the
racetrack, the camping will be like any other.  We can have fires (as of
now, but things are pretty dry around here) so bring some fire wood.

The show and swap meet will be inside the race track and as an added
feature, the SCCA will be holding a national meet which will feature all of
their road course classes running.  The Formula Vees will be a fun class to
watch as they run the 1200 VW engine (tweaked a bit).

On Sunday, we will be able to take our VW's around the track behind the pace
car for a $5 insurance fee.  The road course is a really hairy one, so
driving it will be a blast.

Friday night if you get in early enough, there will be a really great dirt
track race on the grounds of Heartland Park, but about 1/2 mile from the
campground.

This should be a great VW weekend, don't miss it!!
