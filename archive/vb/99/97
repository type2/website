If we go back to the original setup we will buy a "new" engine.
An engine that is the most close to the original engine.

As far as we know the life of the motor is under control.
Because it has an oiltemp. meter and an oilpressure meter.
The oiltemp. is always about the Kmph we drive.
So if we drive 90 Kmph the meter shows 90 degrees C, and if we drive 110
Kmph it shows 110 degrees C.
The oilpressure is always 2 bar. We dont know if that is correct. Shouldn't
it be 3 bar?
