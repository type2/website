1 145 666 in July 1963?  That doesn't fit into the sequence of
chassis numbers and dates I have.  Although, looking at the
whole sequence, it isn't that consistent by itself:
 
1 July  1 139 422

4 Aug   1 145 027

5 Aug   1 144 103   (1200)
5 Aug   1 144 303   (1200)
5 Aug   1 145 427   (1500)
5 Aug   1 146 028   (1500)

8 Aug   1 141 835   (1200)

Taking these numbers at face value, they built about 5,600 Buses in
the whole month of July, and then on 5 August were able to crank out
1,900 more, which doesn't seem likely.

I am starting to think that it might not be possible to nail down
the 1200/1500/0.75 ton/1 ton changes accurately with the information
that is now available to anyone.

On your Bus, do the dates on the wheels approximately match the Bus?
Are the front and rear suspensions original to the Bus?  Just curious.
