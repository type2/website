they were $8 ea from the dealer- $32 plus tax for a set of 4-  dunno the wcm 
price.   At the local dealer I ordered them, then picked them up a few days 
later- as they were not in stock here.  Some dealers do have them on the 
shelf- the CA dealer we went to to get them when unlowering my Dad's 63 sc 
had them on the shelf.
