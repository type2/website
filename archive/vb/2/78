Subject: VW show in Knoxville, TN

Greetings all!

I was wondering if anyone was planning on attending the Bug Jam in
Knoxville, TN this weekend?  It's a pretty nice two day show.

I have a couple of items I am trying to sell.

1.  A child's cot that came out of a 68-71 camper.  It has the black poles.
It's in really good condition.  I'd like to get $30 plus shipping.

2.  Trailer hitch.  I got this from a friend and was going to use it on a
late model westy.  I know for sure that it will fit a VW Thing.  It's a very
nice hitch that mounts BEHIND the bumper using the bumper brackets.  Extra
sturdy.  I'd like to get $50 plus shipping.

If anyone is interested in either of these items, please e-mail me directly.
If you are interested and want to pick them up at the show this weekend, I
will be glad to bring them.

Thanks,
Victor
