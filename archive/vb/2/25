Howdy Y'all,
I'm wondering if anyone in the Ohio\Kentucky\indiana areas can help me out with a few bus items I am looking for.  I want rear cabinets for a pre-68 split window camper.  Also, for my Vanagon I want EITHER a middle passenger seat or complete camper interior (with a decent pop-top would be a great bonus!)  If you don't mind shipping some of these items (at my expense of course) it doesn't matter where you are located.  I'm not that picky as far as condition or originality goes, I just want to get my 2 buses "completed" (yeah, right, like they are EVER completed!!)



Peace, John Baker
