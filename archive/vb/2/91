The colour was called 'chameleon'.  I forget what brand it was, but I could 
find out.   I was not aiming for the perfect match, but this is it.   where 
some of the coats later applied on a rim had chipped off, this stuff matched. 
  polished up some of another wheel which was still the original paint, it 
matched.  the original color gets lighter with age and weather.      the 
paint chip looks a light khaki, but on the rim it looks an offwhite.  It is 
hard to get an idea from an itty bitty paint chip.  Silver White or Silver 
Beige or whatever they called the rim colour isn't silvery at all.   
very odd.

anyway, it may have been throwing money at frivoulousness, but now I have 
some shiny rims.  :)   I need to get tires on them and put them on the bus.

they did paint the 55-67 bus rims either 14" or 15" the same colour right?
