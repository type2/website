Subject: Mar-Hyde..One step..rust converter

From the desk of Rusty Vdub                     I
tried Mar-Hyde One Step rust converter(from local auto
store was 2 bucks then..is now 6 bucks..10 oz rattle
can size) on some hard to reach rust areas on my 67
...4 years ago.It seems to slow that rust down very
good.It's a one step shot converts rust into black
rust....aaahhh, I mean to a black primer
sealer...Yep..turns black.You can paint over
it/fiberglass/bondo/bubblegum whatever if you want.It
seems to do the job.
