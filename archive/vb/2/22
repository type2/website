Subject: Torsion bar id marks?

I have noticed that torsion bars have some common markings, at least 66-67.
ON the short (chassis) end there is a divot like mark, a character that
appears like an A, the the other bar has a single line in it and what
appears to be a number? Are these A's the direction of rotation, a side
designation, or nothing identifying? I have marked then right left as
removed, but really don't trust the PO to have done anything right and want
t amethod to double check this...The OE bars are very mint, and I want to
keep them that way.
So far, it appears the one with the sqaurish divot and the A? is a the pass
side?
