Or a protractor, a 12" piece of thread, and a nut.  Drill a small hole 
through the center of the protractor, run the thread through, knotting 
the back so it doesn't pull through, and tie the nut on the end of the 
thread.  Put flat side of protractor against bottom of spring plate, 
read angle from 90 degree mark.

Cost: <1.00  Accuracy:  better than the cheap angle finders.
