I used a zinc-rich primer on a top-rack that I built
out of electrical conduit, and it worked OK out here
in the desert, until I loaned it to Jon Furst for a
trip to the east coast to pick up some parts, at which
point, it rusted through the primer and topcoat around
about 1/3 to 1/2 of the welds.  Good idea here in the
desert southwest, but I don't think it would hold up
unless you put a very good topcoat on (I used rattle
cans) soon after the primer application in any high
humidity environment.
