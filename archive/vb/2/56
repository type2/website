Subject: camper mag ads

 Sorry to who replied, but I'm a Rivera camper guy and don't know what a so
42 or so 44 looks like. All the ads have tents, some small, 1 huge (bigger
than the bus wider and way taller), 1 side flaps, 2 stripped tent on roof,
most in camping spot. Have ad name from VWOA and thats all. No pictures.
