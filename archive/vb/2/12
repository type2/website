use the ground on the taillight housing.  run a wire from that ground spade 
to the body of the bus- as it is the pass side you could ground it where the 
battery ground strap attaches.    Otherwise a weak ground the lights will 
ground through each others circuit.  

you could also test this by using a grounded test light- is that brighter 
than the bulb holders-

the red/white is taillight/liscence plate light,

the black/white is brake signal/turnsignal
