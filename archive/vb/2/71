I personally use a Compu-Fire, 3 different VW's 2000- 45,000 miles on them
with out a hiccup. The secret is having the right coil and wires. Many
people use a cheapy Autozone coil  which isn't internally ballast resisted
and/or the wrong type of wires which will cause premature failure of the
Compu-fire (and Petronix?). I am not a fan of Petronix, due to the changes
that have to be made to install and the PITA it is to convert back to points
on the Highway if it fails.

ps; Compufire now has in there packaging a warning about the use of
incorrect coil and/or wires.

How many miles do these things go before they "break". Just replaced my
Pertronix Ignitor which flatlined at 5.4 volts (shorted according to the
trouble shooting sheet)  with the original points. Only had 9000 miles on it
and it really provided a smoother idle to the motor with slightly improved
gas mileage.

Any answers/suggestions out there??

Also saw a horrific bay Westy accident this PM on one of the main traffic
routes in this city. Looks like it or the other car was running a red. The
Westy ended up on it's roof and when I passed it was completely and totally
in flame front to back with road asphalt in flames as well. Don't know the
status of the driver and will probably find out tommorrow.
