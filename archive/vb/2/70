>> Yeah, happy 46th bday to Jon/Deb Stanton and self
this weekend. As scarey as it seems we were all born
on the 4,5,6th of Aug WAAAAAAY back in 1955.
Stantons have adult kids and mine is just learning to
say "potty". The first of the two words that descibe
Daddy's mouth. ;-)

I think that we should flood the "go-go" bar parking
lot with splittie buses and THEN try to blend in. Naw,
hanging at the ABC Jerome XI Raffle bus site is just
as good~ and better chance of getting hot and wet.
hahahaha

BTW: as long as I'm burning band width-
I used "go-go" because I didn't know if I could that 
*** for tat kind of word. I always heard "go-go" and
wondered "where-where?".
