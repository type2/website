Subject: Re: [VB] Westy Price Opinions??

Sounds pretty reasonable to me, depending on the scale
of the bodywork.  I am starting to feel that it is
cheaper to find a good clean original or restored bus
and pay a bit more.   I paid $1900 for my 66 Deluxe,
paid another G to have the nasty hippy paint scheme
soda blasted and I am still in process.  All that for
a nearly rust-free bus, which is a commodity in the
midwest.  I just picked up a real sweet '56 Packard
for only $7500 and the old owner (a co-worker)had over
$13,000 invested.  Not a VW story but I feel the same
applies with any collector car.  Sometimes you can
cash in on others peoples misforture.  (I realize that
that sounds awful but it is true)
