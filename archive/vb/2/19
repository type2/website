Because in some locales, it's possible to track down the 
with just the plate #.  They probably don't want people
showing up in the middle of the night to "borrow" the
car.  There was a famous case in California years ago,
where a guy took down a chick's plate #, went to DMV, got 
her address, then went to her house and did bad things to her.
