Hey Guys,
This is the weekend for our Gorgeous Gathering in Hood River OR (just 1hr.
east of Portland OR).
The raffle car is getting assembled. It is a 64 Beetle body on a 69 pan. New
paint and headliner
and it is looking good. Saturday around 3:00 is the get together at the Ranch
Drive In up in the
heights of Hood River. Sometime around 6:00-6:30 we will depart for Georges
field to set up
camp. Sunday morning the show starts up at 10:00a.m. and ends at 4:00p.m.
Check out the website
for directions: Gorgevwclub.com
see you there,
Craig Spaeth
