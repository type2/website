Wire wheeling and/or sandblasting unfort. doesn't remove all rust either.
Rust will remain in the pores of the steel, and the acid washes/zinc
chromate treatments help kill/prevent that until you get the primer and
finish on.

David, your bus looks absolutely beautiful. The combination of the tedious
labor of the wire wheels, I believe, was the way to go. I plan on similar,
followed by the acid mostly for flushing the rails where I can't get it.

Is that grey DP? or a painted finish over a primer?

Well see you all in 100.....

Al

My 59 dc had very little rust under it... a few little areas that needed
some attention but basically I was able to get a nice shiny metal surface
with no residual rust with a small wire wheel on a either a right angle or a
straight die grinder... and about 80-100 hours.  I think if I had lots of
rust and faced with the task again I would sand blast it unless it's real
rusty then I don't know what I would do.  To sand blast it, either get it
way up in the air or do the rotisserie thing.  There is no substitution for
removing rust... a chemical 'wash' won't do an absolute job.

I've said it before and I'll say it again... it sounds like a lot of work
but I actually enjoyed the work once I convinced myself to start.  It was
fascinating to look at the workmanship, the weld splatters, the drip
patterns in the old primer, etc. etc. etc.  Just take your time and have
fun! :-)
