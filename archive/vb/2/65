The pulley *is* the back.  Front is front...

That ground screw is D- .  It should be screwed into a tapped hole right
in the casing of the generator.

>And to run for "HOW LONG"

Bentley says "a short time" and Muir says to just "touch" the connection.
I'd guess that five or ten seconds is probably good.  When you do this the
generator shaft should spin - you might disconnect it when the shaft seems
to have reached a constant speed.

Yes.
