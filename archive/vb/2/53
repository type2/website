 Scott has painted my 1952 Zwitter black-brown, and does it look nice. He has 
 painted two coats base coat and two coats clear. Before, the car didn't have 
 enough paint on it to color sand it. Now it does. Before, the car had a 
gouge 
 in the bondo on the driver's side left front fender. Now it does not. Scott 
 did a terrific job.
 
 He's finishing color sanding right now. He has only the hood and front 
 fenders color sanded so far. But one can tell how the car will turn out 
right 
 now. That's superior.
 
 We also made a tool to remove the right door hinge pin. The tool is made of 
a 
 C-clamp with a hole in it (bought from Harbor Freight for $6.49) and 
machined 
 at the local machine shop for $17.50; total cost, $23.99. We'll hafta weld a 
 piece of an old
 pin and a nut on the bottom, the nut so that we can use a socket and ratchet 
 on it.
 Then we'll be able to jack and screw the old pin out of the hinge. The old 
 pin is 0.492 inches and the hole in the top of the C-clamp is 0.50 inches.
