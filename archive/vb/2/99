Hi Bus People   After reading about sand blasting and
the hours spent in prep and the clean up.To say
nothing about the trails of sand left down the
roadways of America.....I propose a plan....First off
one of us win's the state lottery for millions then we
open a Bus Center.Maybe in the center of the United
States...sorry all the rest of you.Members of this
list get to take a road trip and have the undersides
of their bus(ah,heck the whole thing) put in a "Bath"
of Dolphin safe.. Whale approved "Acid dip mouse
meltdown fluid".In goes a dirty rat infested ...spider
condo....with rust and the remains of undercoating and
Hippie pinko paint(Just a joke folks) from the late
60's and out comes a shinny as new bus body headed
straight for the dryer then the zinc dip...off to the
paint booth! For the Por-15 or your choice and
many...many coats of primer and paint applied by the
grandson of the original VW bus painter..and special
application in former mouse hideouts of mouse "Hot
Tubs" full of the melt down acid.....No more stinky
mouse bodies.Well are you with me? Leave the sand for
me to play on at the beach and send your bus to
Colorado for a mouse bath make over free from the
California Lottery.This offer not available in
AZ..Oregon..or east of the mighty Miss-A-Sip...
