How many miles do these things go before they "break". Just replaced my =
Pertronix Ignitor which flatlined at 5.4 volts (shorted according to the =
trouble shooting sheet)  with the original points. Only had 9000 miles =
on it and it really provided a smoother idle to the motor with slightly =
improved gas mileage.

Any answers/suggestions out there??

Also saw a horrific bay Westy accident this PM on one of the main =
traffic routes in this city. Looks like it or the other car was running =
a red. The Westy ended up on it's roof and when I passed it was =
completely and totally in flame front to back with road asphalt in =
flames as well. Don't know the status of the driver and will probably =
find out tommorrow.
