Ok, social engineering... since I live out in bumbf*ck Oregon, that is
sometimes impossible... and, since I myself haven't been hoarding parts for
years, I often have used all my cool parts for my own bus so I don't have
the cool stuff to trade.  But, I'll give it to you, I guess I might have to
learn that I maybe can't have it perfect the first time... hmmmm.

I haven't really been holding off assembly... I work on the bus an hour or
so each evening... working on several different areas at once... hoping I
can find the right parts before it's absolutely necessary.  So far, I've
been able to avoid ALL repop parts so in my mind, why start now.  Plus, my
goal has slipped to next spring so I figure I have time.

I will end up with repop door panels and headliner.  Door and window seals
are a high probability.  The master cylinder isn't og but is ATE...  and
sure, I have my share of EMPI and Porsche parts but they're all period
stuff.  *Period* and then a repop shift rod boot in my mind just doesn't
fit.
