you need an angle finder.   Red the section on the rear torsion bars in your 
Bentley.  If you dont have a (Bentley) 1963 Transporter Workshop manual go 
get one.   You have to find out how far off you present angle is, do the math 
to set it back right, turn inner bar this was each spline is x degrees, the 
spring plate is y degrees.  mark first setting before taking spring plate 
off,  (punch dots on spring plate and torsion bar).  The correct angle-- and 
pictures is in the book.   You can buy new rear tosion bushings (same as a 
bay window bus) at your VW dealer- install with talcum powder.
