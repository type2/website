On the 911 list, it's been observed that there are a lot of self-styled
"brokers" on ebay, who try to "short" cars.  They find an AutoTrader (
or similar rag) car, put it on ebay, without the owner's consent.  Then they 
collect the cash from the new buyer, buy the car, and pocket the difference.

Of course, for the cars we're looking at, CarFax is useless...
