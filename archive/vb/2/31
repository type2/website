Ok, I'll give you the acid wash thing... many think they can just wipe some
miracle solution over a non prepped surface and expect the world.

That's gray primer/sealer over a healthy layer of 'TuffCoat' (or however you
spell it).  My painter friend said the tuffcoat product helps to curb any
residual rust and any minor 'imperfections' and then I did two coats of
primer/sealer (all DuPont products).  I wanted to match the gray color
closer but it didn't work out.  I borrowed a color match spectrophotometer
and it gave us a reading of some Toyota 'mouse gray' color...  I wasn't
satisfied with it's color matching capabilities even though I had a primo
spot of perfect paint on the heater tube... but then again, that paint had
probably changed over the 40+ years of being heated also.   I think Ronnie
said he had some of the 'correct' color mixed up that match a nice spot that
he found.

Keep us posted with a few pictures occasionally :-)
