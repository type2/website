I have done the following several times on my Dad's Bug and a few times
on my Bus:

Remove distributor cap.  Remove rotor.  Adjust points.  Adjust timing.
Replace distributor cap.  Crank engine.  Ponder the engine's failure 
to start.  Remove distributor cap, check point gap, reinstall cap.
Crank again.  No start, WTF?!?  AHA!  Retrieve rotor from bumper or
crankshaft pulley well and reinstall.  Crank engine, it starts.  :)
