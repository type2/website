Hi Ronnie,
We wash out all those areas and every time it is amazing how much crud comes 
out and often blocks the drain holes.  We have heard about 3M products that 
spray with a wand into these areas to seal the metal from rusting.  Has 
anyone tried these products and/or knows of a website on them?  Up till now 
we have used roofing tar thinned down in these areas.    Eric&Barb
