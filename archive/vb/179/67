$50 seems like a lot for such a product. 
-------------------------------------------
You guys said $50.00 ............... I said get your magnets out of an
old hard drive.
I just used magnets mounted to a plate out of an old Winchester
hard-drive that was boat anchor material.
That is free.
What is better than free?
If you can do your own testing for free why not.
My statement:
(it caught the iron particles in the strainer plate. To judge the volume
on a new engine I've got to say the particles leveled the strainer plate
top side for the first 8000 miles. It is substantially lesser amounts as
the engine has seated the cylinders and other steel parts. Its cheap
insurance even if it just makes you feel better.)
-----------------
These magnets may not gather anything in an engine with 25000 miles on
it. I would hope that the cylinders and rings are fully seated and any
small amounts of magnetic material was being properly filtered out by the
oil filter.
As I see it the sole and only use for the magnets, wherever mounted, is
to stop circulation of abrasive particles to your bearings during the
break-in cycle, with the hopes that you have better oil pressures for a
linger time.
If it works ............ OK, Otherwise remember it was Free and If you're
getting ready to break in a new engine this would be the right time to
prove it to yourself.
On my Westy the Magnets have remained as a benign steel plate clinging to
the strainer plate for five years and 140K on the first engine and remain
on the fresh engine; decoration or deranged logic?
