I don't want to beat this thing to death but: If you've got a Type IV
engine the oil filter mount has a bypass valve that bypasses the filter
at high volume and high pressure. 
No I don't know what these pressures are.
They are set as a safety factor so you don't explode oil filters.
I've been told that they are in the range of 47 pounds, similar to the
single oil bypass valve on the type IV engines that bypasses as a safety
so you don't explode your oil cooler; again said to be about 47 psi.
Since I'm holding over 60 psi I can only attribute it to the sandwich
plate that I installed for my RX7 oil cooler with higher bypass pressure
valve and the fact that I blocked the oil filter mount bypass valve as
recommended by those already running the sandwich plate adapters.
I'd almost bet Jake Raby has all of these bypass pressure numbers.
