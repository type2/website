OK, the http://www.filtermag.com/ looks like a quality product using
neodymium magnets, not the cheap magnets that some people are selling. I
still would argue that that one could purchase $11.00 worth of #29 at
http://www.wondermagnet.com/dev/magnet29.html and get results just as good
as the $49.95 filtermag.
