Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [bus-life] Different Camper

We have a 65 with a Westy so42  walkthru kit installed by TEC.
Bus and kit came over separately and kit installed in 65. Has the
TEC badge on the pop top and a 65 Westfalia badge inside.
We know it was a U.S. conversion because there are no
notches on the A pillar for the child cot brackets and no
electrical outlet in the back or inside. Also, no indication in
the mcode for camper set up. It also only has one crank out
window one each side. The molding around the pop
top hole is different than factory.
I guess it was faster to order separate than getting on the waiting list for
a
factory Westy. I don't know if this was done by the dealer and sold
off the lot, or if it was done by the customer.
