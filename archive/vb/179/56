http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ is a well-worn path in my bookmarks :-)  The
link to the distributor specs is right at the top.

I concur with the 009, 28-30 degrees is something you will hear again and
again.  When I ran a 009, before the magic of the SVDA + Pertronix + CDI,
I always ran at 28 and didn't suffer any problems even with gasahol.  With
the new setup I run with the specs listed on the above site for my dizzy.
