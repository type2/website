When the engine is re-started, these particles break loose,
---------------------
That is why I say to put it on the strainer plate, very little oil flow
there.
Just what weeps down through the little gap in the bolt through aluminum
plate.
At 20K you should have pretty well stopped breaking in and get very
little metallic material.
Although I've left mine on for five years and about 150K, I can only say
that it has collected quite a bit of material when the rings and
cylinders were seating. After that I got and currently get almost
nothing.
Any potential good this simple devise might possibly do has to be done
during the break-in period.
