Everything old is new again.  VW offered a magnet that fit on the inside
of the oil strainer plate.  Look at page 6-1 of the '50-'62 Bentley.
If you are running a stock oil system, I can see some benefit to a
magnet, but if you're running a filter, I don't know how much good
it would do.

As has been mentioned, hard drives often have very strong magnets in
them.  You might need some tiny Torx bits (or a Dremel) to get into
the hard drive.  On the ones I have pulled out, the magnet is maybe
1"x0.75"x0.1" (25 mm x 19 mm x 2.5 mm) and is bonded to a steel backing
plate with a couple of mounting holes in it.  Be careful around other
magnets and steel, iron, etc.

I have an idea that these magnets might also be handy for mounting small
items (cup holders, etc) to the dash without drilling holes - just bolt
the magnet onto the item via the holes in the mounting plate and stick
it on the dash.  Maybe put a piece of paper over the magnet first so as
not to scratch the paint.  Note that if you have a wreck, the forces
involved may well overcome the magnet and send stuff flying.

I know there was a magnet in the automatic transmission oil pan of my
'89 Ch(-at-)vy, and it had a "fuzz" of particles clinging to it at the 100k
service.  Usually, though, automatic transmissions have 50K-100K miles
service intervals, compared to an oil filter service interval of 3K-5K
miles or so.

I checked out their Web site and it does seem to be a real company.
(Some of these things are multi-level marketing scams, etc.)  I tried
the "buy now" link and looking up a couple of different cars results
in a server error.  Looking at their whois info, they have both
"B&B International" and "OPI International Incorp" at the same address.
I didn't find too much for either B&B or OPI; there are apparently
several companies with each of those names.

Googling around, I find a bit of discussion on a T(-at-)y(-at-)ta Supra mailing
list about them, including an alternative source:

$50 seems like a lot for such a product.  Dunno what the nice Mann
filters run, but at $3 each for a decent AC-Delco or Motorcraft filter,
I can buy 16 oil filters for $50.
