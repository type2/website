Subject: Re: [T2] OT: Verizon Phone Service for Bus Traveling

I have found at&t to have much better coverage. Verizon doesn't have
consistent coverage in some areas they claim to. Pretty disappointing when
you break down in your bus in a populated area and still can't get coverage.
When you complain they don't care because you're on the hook for a year and
there are more to replace you when the year is up.
