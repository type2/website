Subject: felt again.

ok, so i was taking a picture of a few gas tank anti rattle felts that I
have in order to send to people when im claiming to look for material like
this...  i had laid out the felts on my *bad* og divider plate and i noticed
that it appears the felt was only attached in certain locations... then i
noticed that the area was about the same length as the gas tank anti rattle
felt... then i thunk sum more....  anyway, the question is: are the divider
plate felts short like the gas tank ones or are they four long strips... one
for each edge?
