Subject: Re: [VB] Ethanol and old buses

We've had methanol-mix fuel in South Africa for years.
Nowadays it seems to be mostly trouble free, but in the
1980s there were lots of problems with corrosion in fuel
systems and carbs.

The main problem with alco-fuels is that the alcohol
separates from the fuel if the car is left standing for any
period of time, and it then starts to suck moisture from the
atmosphere, which makes for a nasty corrosive mixture.

I don't know about accelerated wear of fuel lines, but I
find mine need to be replaced avery 18-24 months. I think it
is a good policy to replace all rubber fuel lines annually.
I did have an engine fire in my 63 Dormobile once, which was
caused by the alco-fuel cracking the accelerator pump
diaphragm.

If you are running alco-fuel, then completely drain the fuel
system (including the carb float bowl) every time you put
the car into storage for more than a month.
