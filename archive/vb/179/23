"Volkswagen buffs" can check out a wide range of cars and parts during the
Fourth annual VW car show on Sunday, November 3rd at Karl's Custom, which is
at 264 East Broadway Road. The show will feature about 75 vintage, offroad
and custom Volkswagens. Trophies will be given for the best restored VW,
best original VW, best VW bus, best of show, and many other categories. "The
vintage VW hobby is really hot right now, especially with the advent of the
new Beetle. Everyone should come out and see this event. It's fun for the
whole family", said manager Tom Butterfly. The show will also include a swap
meet with at least 50 spaces for people who want to buy, sell or trade VW
parts and accessories. There will be plenty of great food as well. The fun
will run from 6a.m. to 3p.m. Admission is free, although attendees are
encouraged to bring cans of food for the St. Mary's Food Bank. There is a
small fee to show cars/swap meet. More than 3,500 people turned out last
November to see a variety of vehicles at the annual Karl's Custom VW Car
Show. The show grows more popular every year. For more information, call
