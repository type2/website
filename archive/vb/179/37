I guess it really depends on where you are and how many transceiver towers
are in place for each company. Here in the Puget Sound/Seattle area I have
far greater reception on Verizon than my wife with AT&T. She is always
getting into no-coverage areas all over. Now, when I go down to the southern
part of the state (Washington) from Chehalis to Vancouver, my wife has far
better coverage with AT&T than I do with Verizon. In fact, much of the
southern part of the state is in digital roaming for me. Sucks big time.

I have at&t and travel all over the us and have no problems, make sure
you get the nationwide plan, roaming charges will kill you.
