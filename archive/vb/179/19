Volks,

. . . I think our air-cooleds are truly the "international vehicle."  Parts
from everywhere, . . .

Poland, Denmark, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, U.S.A. France, Mexico,
Brazil, Australia, South Africa and, . . . oh yeah, . . . Germany.

My son is coming home Wednesday from East Germany.  He's been working over
there for an industrial organization that represents manufacturers of electric
"e" bikes, . . . fairly big over there.  I told him not to come home without a
cache of semaphores.
