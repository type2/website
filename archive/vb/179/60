Chris,

Please!  Do you use Nextel?  We have them at work and they SUCK!  One of
the biggest holes is in West L.A. right in front of their offices! 
Deplorable.   The one thing to say about the holes is that at least they
are consistent.  Many times I'll count down my partner to service
interruption, I've gotten to know right where they begin and end on
certain routes.  They never seem to fix any of the problem areas.  Thank
God I'm not paying.

Steve
