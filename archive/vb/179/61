Subject: Re: [VB] Distributor issues

I'll bet that picture is *before* he took it apart to put the new clamp on, when it was running OK.
No 1 is at 7 o'clock. I'll bet his distributor drive gear is in wrong. As far as his current
problem, he probably doesn't have the distributor shaft engaged in the drive pinion, like Clara
said.

Look at that picture AGAIN.  That is a vac. dizzy, but it is rotated so
far left(retarded) that its a wonder it will fire at all. Look at where
the condenser is sitting! That vacuum can should be rotated at least 90
degrees counter clock wise to get even close to the ball park.

Yes everything should work if its all lined up, but yours isn't. #1
fires at about 3-4 O'clock on the watch scale.  Reposition all wires
accordingly.  MAKE SURE you are at TDC for #1 and that the wires are
in/on the appropriate places.  Trust, me I've F'd this up before and
chased my tail for a bit.
