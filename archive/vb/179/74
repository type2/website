Heat can affect magnets, but not at oil temperatures

thin metal will be attracted less.  There is a problem with passing a
magentic field through a ferrous surface.  Most of the field goes along
the surface.  The thin Fram can would probably work better with the
magnet!

A better approach would be to embed the magnet in a non-ferrous part, so
that the full magnetic field would be available to trap ferrous particles.

Seems like I'd rather get a neodymium magnet from that wondermagnets page
for a buck or two.  Stronger magnet and cheaper price.
