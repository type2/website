But is the international thing good for US citizens and other socialistic 
European governments?

Personally I try to have as many "Made in USA" parts on my VW as possible 
and if not US then another reputable country like Germany, England, Canada, 
and so forth.

NAFTA and a joke for the WTO will be the death of the US manufacturing 
base...  Unless you strive to be the old person greeter at Wal-Mart?


Since this is low on VW content and I would get administer lashings on the 
Type2 list, here is some good stuff:

I traded some parts this weekend to get a very nice totally restored German 
019 distributor.  Sweeeeeeet!!!  (Easterwood will want to shoot me if I tell 
him one more time ;) LOL)  Driving notes to come later versus a German 
009.... Needless to say it was a real PITA to find one.

Take Care,
Adrian
