Right.  I mentioned getting magnets from a hard drive too.  The original
product that Ronnie posted about had a $50 retail price tag.  What I
was trying to say is that $50 seems like a lot of money for what is
probably the same kind of magnets that come out of a hard drive.  In
other words I was agreeing with you.  I think the idea of using a
magnet to pick up ferrous stuff in your oil might work, but I,
personally, wouldn't spend $50 to find out.
