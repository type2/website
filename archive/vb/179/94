Second problem is that the area above the drain plug is a stagnant area,
flow-wise. 
-----------------------------------
I have never pulled the strainer plate that I didn't find crud of some
type between the strainer and the steel plate. I just get more with the
magnets attached.
Stagnant, true but when the engine is turned off the magnet gathers what
is in the area. Small amount that it might be, its still working to some
degree.
