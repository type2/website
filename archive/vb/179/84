Subject: Re: Distributor issues

First off get that distributor to sit with the rotor engaged.  It sounds 
like it is not sitting in the grove correctly.

Second, find top dead center.  When the engine is sitting at TDC put the 
hash mark on the dizzy exactly where the tip of the rotor is pointing.  Does 
not matter how far off the distributor drive is to work, so do not get all 
muddled up on what the stock place should be... These things are off all the 
time due to backyard motor build morons.

Third, disconnect all the plug wires from the cap.  The cap goes on only one 
way, place it on correctly.  Note where the hash mark and rotor are pointing 
on the cap, mark this plug location with "1".  Put plug wire #1 on this 
spot, continue around the cap in a clockwise fashion for 4,3,2.  Done.

Try to start her up... If it is bogged down take the dizzy and rotate it 
about 1/4" COUNTERclockwise to advance it up a bit.

Once you do this once or twice you will learn a lot about the motor and 
hopefully have a religious experience getting it to work again :)

Good Luck,
Adrian
