The early stock ones grounded through the mounting clip on the top.
Later ones grounded through a stud on the top that threaded into the
body.  As originally wired, the ground makes the speedo light work.

If you have an aftermarket flasher (no VW part number) then it probably
doesn't have a ground connection and grounding the metal body (if so
equipped) won't help.  A #554 aftermarket flasher will have 4 connections
and work like the original VW flasher.  This is a 12 V part; I don't know
of a 6 V equivalent.
