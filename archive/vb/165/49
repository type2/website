Subject: Re: [VB] Flasher Relay -- How to Ground

Unfortunately you need a 4 prong grounded flasher.  We used the infamous 
  later model blinken box - 9 pin? - on our 59 and just used the 
contacts that we needed.  The blinken box is grounded when you screw it 
to the body through the center.  We used the bentley wiring diagram to 
figure out what contacts to use.
