I knew someone would bring that up :)

With a 12.5lb flywheel and C/W crank you are keeping stock weight through 
the reciprocating mass, but in different locations.  Basically what you 
steel from the flywheel you are adding to the crank, but in better places to 
help reduce crank "whip".

So you stay "stock" by moving the weight around... If that analogy makes 
sense.

The owner of DMS and myself had a long talk about this issue.  He drives a 
SC bus work truck so he is familiar with the plight of bus owners on this 
issue.

With all that weight the motor would have horribly slow response and act 
sluggish.

But this is my opinion, based off a lot of input by others.

Take Care,
Adrian
