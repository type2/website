As per Bergs site, "The ultimate in VW crankshafts.
Berg cranks are a true fully forged crankshaft as are
the VW factory crankshaft and the Okrassa. All other
aftermarket crankshafts are hammered to outside shape
without proper grain orientation. Ours are done in the
original VW forging dies that we had modified for
additional cheek width, stroke length, plus we have
added the maximum counterweight which will fit in the
case. 
I dunno....and no, I don't work for him!
