Subject: Link pin shim help

Hi,

I am putting dropped spindles on my 63 single cab and I am confused about 
the link pin shims. I used a straight edge and measured a 7 mm offset and 
according to my idiot guide and the instructions with the spindles I should 
use 5 shims on the outside and 3 on the inside. Why should this be different 
then the way it was stock? It had 4 shims on each side of the link pin when 
I took it apart why shouldn't I just put it back the way it was? Did 
something change over time with my trailing arms and the offset is different 
then when it was new?

By the way I am using the same spindles that I took off the truck they were 
rebuilt and lowered.

Any help would be great,
Bob
