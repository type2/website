Subject:  [VB] RE: Best source for rubber? 

I use West Coat Metric for everything but the front felt window seals; for 
those I go to Ronnie and Old Volks and get the Italian seals.

If you are planning on redoing the rubber on your entire bus, West Coast 
Metric offers complete kits, right down to the little rubber dots that go on 
the gas flap.  Call 800-247-3202 and ask for Jim, and tell him Richard sent 
you.
