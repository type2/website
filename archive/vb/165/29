Intake valves ? Are you sure ? I normally put in SS exhaust valves
as the intakes generally outlast the exhaust  2:1. The exhaust valves
run hotter and are the ones I would expect to get more abuse
( SS will bend and not break off ) , and shim new stock springs for 
a moderate increase in spring rate for a stock cam.
