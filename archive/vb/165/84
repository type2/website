Subject: Re: [VB] accel. cable cut tranny case

FWIW the accel cable setup on my 67 DC came with a piece of plastic
sheathing that goes from the end of the cable's metal tube at the
transmission, to the end of the through-the-fan-shroud tube where it
pokes forward through the firewall.  The sheathing is just the right
diameter to fit over each metal tube perfectly.  I improved it by
clamping each end to the metal so it wouldn't slide off all the time.
