Subject: re:oil filler prob

was asked:"who sells this tool"

i heard you can get the internal pipe wrench at any decent hardware store. i
imagine a plumbing supply house would definitely carry one.

i just saw one in mcmaster carr catalog. 63.75 for a fancy one, non-fancy
ones range in price from $6.23 to $10.35. depending on size...i am not sure
what size one would use, the options are 3/8", 1/2", 3/4" or 1". the
expensive one ranges from 1" to 2".
