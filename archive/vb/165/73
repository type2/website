The Berg counter balance power pulley has an interesting history. I first
saw one up close in the early eighties at SIR drags. It was a compromise of
a small diameter power pulley and adding back in the weight removed. They
understood the idea of inertia in their power requirements for racing.

If I follow Georges logic, then you would still lighten up the flywheel only
to a lessor amount, what about the point that was made earlier which is to
add a Berg counterbalancer! As the berg unit is smaller dia, would there be
a formula to find a balance point?
