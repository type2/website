Kevin and list,

I devised a method which eliminates having to deal with the left upper
bolt installation. I've given details before so I'll just list some steps
- this works with my doghouse housing as well:

1) If it's there, drill or knock out the threaded insert.

2) Clean up,  degrease the bolt and all obvious places which will be
associated with the following work:

3) Buy these:

    Sears - 17/19mm flat racheting box wrench, Craftsman, $12

    Auto Parts store - a tube of 3M yellow weatherstrip adhesive #80001,
       or Permatex equivalent.

4) Your engine is  installed, except for the upper left bolt, and you want
life to be much easier from now on, so -

5) apply a liberal amount of adhesive to the underside of the bolt head,
and down its length for about 1/2 inch. Apply some to the front face of
the tranny side of the hole and the hole's interior. You're under the bus
as you do this.

6) Insert the bolt, get out and carefully get the nut onto the thread
with your fingers, and then tighten up, using your new tool (17mm end).

7) Next time you r and r the engine, the bolt will be glued in place and
waiting for you to merely turn the nut on, and tighten with the tool.

8) Do the same with the right side bolt that holds the top of the starter.
Now both bolts are patiently awaiting you, and your engine goes in or out
in mere minutes, no crawling under the bus to get greasy and pissed off.

I've been doing it this way since 1974. It works.

regards, and happy engine r-and-r's!!
