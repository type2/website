I have a tool that's something like this but you have to have the
engine running.  Basically it's a grounded point and a screw with
a point on it that gets connected to the spark plug wire.  You turn
the screw in and out to check the maximum distance it will fire and
there is a little kilovolt scale next to the screw.

I know you can get the coil to fire continuously if you use a relay
that you wire up like a buzzer, and I think you might be able to get
close with a turn signal flasher -- not continuous, but it would spark
very often.

This might be a good thing to hook up on your Bus at the VW show.  Looks
cool, but also convinces people they shouldn't grab any random metal
parts of your Bus...
