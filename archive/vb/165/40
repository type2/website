Kevin,

Well, not really.  The extra strength will help if you are over
stressing the motor like revving it to 7K at every stop light or drag
racing.  I guess pulling a heavy trailer up steep grades could be
considered over stressing too.  You'd have to be doing it quite a bit though.

You'll get more longevity out of the motor you build if you use a
counterweighted crank and make sure you balance everything to a nat's
ass (not sure how much that weighs).  If you are keeping it under
5K(rpm) I think a cast crank is fine.  Keep compression to around
6.9-7.1.  Get a NEW case and heads with some of the money you saved on
the cast crank.  

This is just my very limited experience and personal opinion (only built
3 motors).  Others with hundreds of motors under their belt should chime in.
