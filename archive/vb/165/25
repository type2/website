This is called a "step stud".  Stock I think it had a regular stud that
was the same diameter all the way through, but VW had the step studs as
replacements if the hole in the case was stripped - you could drill the
hole in the case bigger and tap it for the big end so it would be secure,
and the small end would still fit through the hole in the flange and take
the same nut.

Browse the online parts book http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp a bit
to find the original VW specs for the step studs.  In a case like this,
where you don't know who's drilled and tapped and done what over the
past 42 years, it's probably best to take all the pieces to the hardware
store and match them that way.  Most good hardware stores (like Ace or
True Value, NOT Home Depot or Lowe's) will stock metric step studs - my
Dad and I once bought two at the VW shop and were surprised to later find
the exact same part at the hardware store.
