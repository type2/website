Well, they're right about maintaining lower end weight when you go to CW
cranks and the extra weight added by the counter weights. But another school
of thought says that if everything is balanced the weight differential won't
matter, to a point. I prefer to keep the heavy factory flywheel and stock
pulley for the extra inertia it gives me. It's harder to lug down under load
than with a lightened flywheel. I really load down my vehicles and I need
that torque.

Interesting. Thanks for a non-condescending reply. 
What if you run the heavier pulley with a stock
flywheel? What if any difference does that make?
