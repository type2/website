Raymond,

From what you have said, it appears that you need to continue using your
own method. My fingers and hands are still able to negotiate around the
fan housing, though there are days that I can feel that slipping away
too! ;-)

I have a recent pic of the engine compartment without engine, showing my
fuel line/pump  arrangement, and you can barely make out both upper bolts
standing at attention thru their respective holes. You may check it out
here if you wish:
