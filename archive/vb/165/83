I added tons of photos to the Jerome 2002 show link on http://thesamba.com/vw.
Many more still to come. Great people and a wonderful time. Check the photos at
you leisure. Higher resolution (3.2mp)of the same images available upon private
request. If your bus/child/wife/lover/etc. is included in the uploaded images~
then I may have an uncropped version for your family/club website-usage.
