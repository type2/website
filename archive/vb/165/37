Yes. The bigger you go the hotter you get as well.
87's have a thinner wall and tend to run hot. I
wouldn't use them but plenty of people do, so i guess
it's a matter of preference. A good investment are the
Berg books that cover engine mods and "How to Hotrod
Your VW". Both have good advice and pointers for
squuzing some ponies out of your motor without
sacrificing longevity. Personally, I would use
machined 88's or 90.5's and leave the 87's alone. But
what do I know? I've only had 2 motors in my bus for
the last 9 years!
