That's definitely loaded down, but then, we aren't talking about a 1600cc
are we. You change the power curve and all the other numbers change. The
original questions pertained to a 1500/1600 stock engine. I have a 1776 on
my trike and love the get up and go and have contemplated putting one in the
truck also with some additional oil and cooling.

Here's a pic of me with one of my buses (my old 62 panel with 1776 single
port), this is how loaded they usualy always are.

Well, they're right about maintaining lower end weight when you go to CW
cranks and the extra weight added by the counter weights. But another school
of thought says that if everything is balanced the weight differential won't
matter, to a point. I prefer to keep the heavy factory flywheel and stock
pulley for the extra inertia it gives me. It's harder to lug down under load
than with a lightened flywheel. I really load down my vehicles and I need
that torque.
