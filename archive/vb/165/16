Kevin, I use 87's out of habit. They are perfectly OK and won't deter from
longevity in normal use. I used to use cut in 88's or 90.5's (same hole),
but it weakens the case and heads when you remove material. If you use a
super case, then that's OK. But who can afford half a grand for a super case
! Now, on my trike I use 90.5's, but the power to weight differential allows
me to do that without suffering from early break down.

But remember, I'm not a doctor, and I don't play one on TV. I have been
building these things since 1969, and if there is something that can go
wrong, I've seen it. I have even done myself in a couple of times by not
taking my time and watching what I was doing. You know, got to get an engine
together tonight and in the bus so I can get to work tomorrow! During the
time I had my 71 westfailure I had three engines in it, one that was my
fault for being in a hurry. Just take your time, listen and filter properly
what's said here on the list, and you will be driving a worry free engine in
no time.

OK bud, I hear ya. No forged stuff.

One more question. If I go with larger P&C's, do I run the risk of
decreasing reliability and
longevity? Reason I ask is I'm thinking about maybe putting in 87's just to
give me a little more
push going up hills. Good idea or not?
