OK.  I assumed you were asking "out of the blue" and didn't have a book.

You might want to look at the Without Guesswork books at the doc
project http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/ .  The '69 version
has the picture with the r-number as in Bentley, while the '72 version
mentions that the r-numbers weren't marked on the gears starting in
January 1972 - look at page 80 and following of the '72 book.  The
direction is to "determine "actual" measurements before repair" which
to me implies that you have to measure the gears while they're in
the original transmission before you take it apart.  I don't know if
this is the only way to do it, though.
