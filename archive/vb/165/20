i also like the T3 FI dizzies - my problem is that most of mine are 
worn; last one stopped coming in at right rpm.

  in fact, i have nearly 100 various dizzies, and if they don't have a 
bad vac can, they don't advance correctly or they bounce timing at 
speed.

what the List NEEDS is a source for rebuilding the damn things, 
REGARDLESS of model. ronnie, we are looking in your direction :)
