Subject: RE: [VB] Forged or not

Lets just clarify a few things.

The new Brazilian VW cranks are cast.

The Cima/Mahle "forged" kits are not a true forging.  If you want a real 
forged piston call J&E, they are about $400 a set just pistons.  I wish 
Keith Black offered the hyperturatic pistons though, because they would be 
great in a T1.  But yes, get the Cima/Mahle "forged" if you want lighter 
pistons.

Forget the expensive billet cranks from Scat and Bugpack (note: billet, not 
forged - only the very very expensive ones are forged as far as I know.  
Unless you want to pay $700 for a crank?).  Look at DMS 
http://www.demellocranks.com./   Currently I run a 69mm VW forged C/W from 
them and am very pleased.  Also I have a 78mm stroker C/W from them and it 
looks great, but not used yet.

Forget the expensive Scat I-Beam rods (not perfect from what I hear).  Stick 
with VW forged units.  DMS claims to have and sell "corrected" Scat I and H 
beams if you want a lighter rod.

You will want to run a 12.5 lb flywheel with a C/W crank as well.  Also 
leave off the Berg Equalizer pulley on a C/W crank (might get flamed for 
that).  The stock pulley is perfect.

I am trying Manley SS valves on my next set of DP heads, but I would follow 
Ronnie's example/discription on the heads.


My $.02,
Adrian
