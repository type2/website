Subject: 1966 double cab

I thought I'd give Rocket Werks one more chance. I called them at their two 
numbers
and got operator intervention saying. "sorry, the number is no longer in 
service" or something like that. Then I went over to their shop ... again (I 
had been there Saturday and Wednesday. Here it was Thursday, and I tried 
again).

This time the door was padlocked and there was a note taped to the door, 
saying. "Call Joe at 870-xxx-xxxx."

Not being enamored of their communication system, it was time to make a 
decision. I decided that I didn't need to go to so much trouble to try to 
find out who Rocket Werks was or whether they had the double cab inside. 
Forget the Double cab. No, I am not into Corvairs. I hope they don't owe 
Knights any money. I don't care who they are.  I am now through with Rocket 
Werks. And that's that.
