Leave it on, it doesn't hurt anything and it's nice looking. Better than my
old stock pulley with all the file marks for the different degree settings!

I have one of those stock size berg deals on my motor
right now. I could take it off but then I would be
back to the no-degree pulley blues that makes tune-ups
that much MORE fun!It's a shame too, it's all
powdercoated and perty!
