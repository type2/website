But mass = inertia. Once it's up to speed the power requirements to keep it
there drops. It may not be "quick" of the line, but it also doesn't require
you to keep your foot into the gas to get it up and down the little lumps in
the road. If you lower the momentum of the flywheel by removing mass, then
you have to add that momentum back in by burning more fuel. I can't remember
where the cross over point is, but VW once showed on a factory Rabbit that
once you were up to speed, it required only 7hp to maintain that speed on
the flat. There was an interesting article on this from the
mechanic/inventor Smokey who wrote engine articles for Popular Science. He
experimented with a superheated fuel injected Rabbit that got 73mpg, but
would not sell the patent unless someone promised a 100K run of cars. Check
out the flywheel bus program in Chicago. They use a 2.7 ton flywheel spun up
to 1900rpm and balanced and rotating in nitrogen bearings. It's cool, but
the gyroscopic effects on the corners create additional problems

Adrian,

Hurrahh, somebody talking some sense. F=MA cannot be violated. If you add
inertia in one portion of the system, you should remove some in another.
Lower mass means more accelleration off the line = higher gas mileage. With
CW crank, motor should idle very smoothly anyway.
