Subject: Gas Leak at Fuel Tap

I've got a slow leak at my fuel tap. Aside from the internal fuel filter 
seal, is there any other seal that is supposed to be there? Also, is there a 
right and wrong way to screw on the tap itself? I was kinda confused which 
thing to tighten first, the part that screws inside the tank or the collar 
that tightens over the outside. Oh, this is a new German tap w/reserve level 
that I got from WW.
