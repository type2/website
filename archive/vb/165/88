 For myself, I prefer to use a 10" swivel
 extension on a bolt from underneath the car and keep the nut insert or
 install one if it isn't there. >

fwiw, I do it the same way, using about a 12'' extension, figure it also
allows me to disconnect the fuel line at the same time. For the starter bolt
you cant beat those offset ratchet boxend wrenches
