Kevin, the purest will tell you that removing any metal, either from align
boring or cylinder/head boring will weaken the engine. In a way they are
right and it is only common sense. But at the same time, all things being
equal, if your block is in good shape and it is align bored, there should be
no problem in getting good usable miles out of it if the engine is assembled
with care. 90% of the rebuilds out there are align bored and it is a rare
bear to find a used block that doesn't need it. I've had several in all the
years that I have built engines, and oddly enough, most of them were 40 hp.
They tell me that the shorter stroke does less overall damage to the mains
than the longer stroke cranks.

This is pretty good. Although I'm not planning on building a performance
engine, it's still good
info.

One thing that baffles me is why they say that align boring a case will
result in overheating and
low oil pressure. Align boring only increases the main bore in the case. The
metal removed on the
case is just replaced with additional metal on the main bearing outer
diameter. As long as the crank
journals remain standard, how would this reduce oil pressure or increase
friction?

Do you think they are getting align boring confused with turning a crank?
