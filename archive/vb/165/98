On the 9-prong box I have, it can ground through the mounting screw,
but it also has a ground wire attached that you can hook up.  It's
an SWF part BGR 200 919, VW 211 953 227 B, 12 V.  30 is the feed
from the fuse, KBl is the speedo light, 49a is the blink output to
the turn signal switch, and the mounting hole or attached brown wire
is the ground.

A #559 generic flasher (not 554 as I said in a previous message) will
also work for 12 V.  It will probably have terminals labeled P L X and
E.  P is KBl (pilot), X is feed, L is 49a (load), and E is 31 (ground).
