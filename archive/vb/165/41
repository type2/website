Subject: mileage

i had a pleasant surprise yesterday.  I drove up to Berkeley from San
Jose.  I put 112 miles on the bus, filled up when I left and when I got
back.  Put in 3.9 gallons, which turns out to be about 28 mpg.  Granted
it was 99% freeway miles, but I didn't think I'd get that.

Anyway, hopefully this isn't a Friday topic.  Forgive me if it is.

thanks
doug
