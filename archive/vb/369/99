Subject: [fmbc] Alabama fall ball (Oct 21-23)

Hi
 We were at the camp out this weekend and tried to send you an email but 
did not have a strong enough connection.  Today we got wifi at a shop 
but they would not let us send email, only download.  So here is the 
email we have been trying to send for 3 days.  You missed a great 
campout.  Hope the mother-in-law is OK.

Well we made it to the Turnipseed camp in the Talladega National Forest 
in Alabama for the Fall Ball.  The good news is the directions Phil gave 
us are good but for reassurance and clarification, the camp is about 
three miles south of the state park/lodge turnout on the west side of 
the road, stay on the 281 and just past a parking area there is a sign 
for Turnipseed road on the left (east).  The other good news is we are 
here and there is lots of space.  The bad news is there are no other 
buses here.  So if no one else joins us by tomorrow we will probably go 
over to the State Park and stay there tomorrow night.
