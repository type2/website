If you really need 4/0 electrical cable, let me know. I salvage it out 
of ~20 year old BMW's for use in electric vehicles, boats, home solar 
projects and to relocate batteries in front engine cars to the trunk. 
The copper is just under 1/2" in diameter, they're 11 feet 4 inches long 
and are engineered to run 6 cylinder engines with AC, alternators, etc. 
It's pretty easy to uninstall using a 10mm socket, 5mm allen wrench and 
a BFScrewdriver. Look for my seller's ID, "everbody" on a major auction 
site for pictures. Deals & detauks for listees, of course.
