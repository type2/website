Ray,

  I had a similar problem but with an aftermarket fuel tank.  The
aftermarkets did'nt have an expansion top on it (I think many old ones
did'nt either?) so my fuel was heating and expanding and flowing right out
my actual gas cap though.  I guess that means that my cap was vented, but I
eventually found an original tank and that solved the problem.  I always
smelled gas too, maybe your problem you described also led to the eventual
demise of my motor as well?

Aloha, J.D.

Ray,

 

I had a similar flooding problem a couple summers ago.  Bus was running
great, but would flood after sitting for a few hours to overnight.  The oil
would also take on a strong gasoline odor after just a few hundred miles.
Finally traced the problem to my gas cap- I lost the original and the one
that I replaced it with wasn't vented.

The tank soaked up heat from the engine, gases expanded, tank pressure
equilibrated by forcing fuel through the needle valve in the carb.  I
realize that later buses have evaporative emissions, but it's possible that
a vent line or charcoal cannister is plugged and causing your problem.

 

E&B are right about the safety issue of an electric pump running on in

the event of an accident or stall.   Most carbureted cars with

electric fuel pumps have a relay that shuts the fuel pump off when the

engine stops.   One type is connected to the oil pressure sender and

only energizes the fuel pump when you have oil pressure.  A second type
needs a tach signal from the points or igniter, it turns the pump

off when the distributor stops turning.   You could even add a

resettable crash sensor, like a modern car.
