Howdy Y'All!

I devoloped a problem with the '65 in the last few days that is giving me
fits.  If any one has ideas I would be grateful.

When the bus is cold, it runs like a champ, smooth, powerful.

After a few minutes it seems like I'm loosing a ground somewhere.  It
begins to cutout, cough. The gen light just glows.  If I hit a bump it
might flicker bright like the gen quit, or it may go out completely and
hte engine smooth out again.  I can pull the lights on and it seems to
help most of the time.

I did find a broken clip on the right rear tail light, but so far nothing
else.

Any ideas?
