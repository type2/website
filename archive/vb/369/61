Subject: Re: Cargo doors

Sorry, We are in Vancouver, BC. Canada, but can have them shipped to WA. or
may be able tp pick them up in the Pacific Northwest.
"Anyone on the list have, or know of someone with nice clean 64-67 cargo doors
(with windows i.e. not panel...glass doesn't matter). Our '65 is in getting
painted so we're kind of scrambling now. Any help greatly appreciated.
Kind regards,
