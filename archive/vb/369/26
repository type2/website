Subject: Double Door's First Camp Out!

As the other Buskatiers at Oktoberbus North Carolina ( our Kokopelli 
magnet is being enjoyed by someone who wanted it from our bus without 
our knowledge ).
NQ we will get our new ones as we pass through,  how about maybe at   
<http://www.bustoberfest.com/>   ?  Seeing how fast we travel?
We were glad that there were fellow buskatiers to appreciate and 
celebrate the Kooky Math Teacher's 60 DDs maiden voyage. Nice  job, time 
well spend!

More than 24 busses were camping   with many new faces to put to email 
address, ( including a hostage bus that was just passing thorough at a 
local store and followed to Oktoberbus ).
Our trip Blog 2005 <http://pnc2005.blogspot.com/> has some Oktoberbus 
pics and will have more.
Also meeting up again with Chris, Craig, and Linda that we had met at 
Canadians shows.

Mad Uncle Dave set up a great camp out.  The location was fantastic - it 
could hold hundreds of buses without crowding.  The facilities were also 
appreciated.  Nothing like a hot shower at a camp out.  Please thank Mr. 
Walter Triplette for the use and occupation of Elchinburg Castle.
