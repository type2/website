Subject: RE: [VB] VW want to remove entusiast site

 Thanks for the idea,
 the site owner already register www.clubedakombi.com.br
 as a way of prevention, but he does not want to give up the name, since
 Vokswagem has never interested in register the site www.kombi.com.br 
before.

 name? I know it is a pain, but you can play their game.
