I'm gonna call a couple of hard, Mountain Dew-hittin' engineers to go to
work on homes here, with a HP48 and a mechanical pencil.  I'm gonna get
all Georg Simon Ohm on his ass.

Per '63-'67 Bentley, E-1 8, stock battery cable size = 25 mm^2
25 3.14159 / square-root 2 * = 5.642 mm diameter
http://www.powerstream.com/Wire_Size.htm says this falls in between AWG
4 at 5.189 mm and AWG 3 at 5.827 mm diameter
5.827 5.642 / dup * 0.6462 * = 0.6892 ohms per km = 0.0006892 ohms per m
http://failsure.net/oacdp/5867part/625.png says the stock battery cable
length is 0.830 mm
0.0006892 0.830 * = 0.0005720 ohm resistance of stock battery cable
Per '63-'67 Bentley, E-7 1, 1500 starter draws 240-280 A under load and
450-520 A at stall
0.0005720 280 * = 0.160 V drop at maximum "under load" current draw
0.0005720 520 * = 0.297 V drop at maximum "stall" current draw

If stock cable replaced with same length AWG 4 cable:
0.81508 1000 / = 0.0008151 ohms per m
0.0008151 0.830 * = 0.0006765 ohms in AWG 4 cable
0.0006765 280 * = 0.189 V drop at maximum "under load" current draw
0.0006765 520 * = 0.351 V drop at maximum "stall" current draw
0.189 0.160 / = 1.181
0.351 0.297 / = 1.182
Therefore AWG 4 cable is approximately 18% worse than stock

If stock cable replaced with same length AWG 2 cable:
0.512664 1000 / = 0.0005127 ohms per m
0.0005127 0.830 * = 0.0004255 ohms in AWG 2 cable
0.0004255 280 * = 0.119 V drop at maximum "under load" current draw
0.0004255 520 * = 0.221 V drop at maximum "stall" current draw
0.119 0.160 / = 0.744
0.221 0.297 / = 0.744
Therefore AWG 4 cable is approximately 25% better than stock
