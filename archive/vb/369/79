I think it's the ethylene glycol fumes.  Clearly it is affecting the
engineers and managers at VW AG, and has done so for a long time.  If
they'd leave that nasty stuff out of their cars, they wouldn't have so
many problems.

All three names are registered, but they don't point anywhere.  One of
them has clearly been registered by a squatter and the other two are
registered to a company in New Jersey that has also registered other
(brand)sucks.com domain names.

Some large companies pre-emptively register (brand)sucks.com names for
their brands.  fordsucks.com is owned by Ford.  gmsucks.com and
chryslersucks.com are owned by the same New Jersey company as above.
