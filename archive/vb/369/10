Subject: 1974 camper

All,

I purchased a '74 camper that I am generally pleased with. Other than a lack
of power, that I hope to slightly remedy with a carb sync and a general
tune-up, the only thing I have a problem with is handling in the wind. I had
a 1979 camper that I don't remember being so sluggish. I just had front end
work done and the tires have good tread. I don't know about the shocks or if
it has sway bars (?) installed. When the wind hits it, it really drives the
bus sideways and does not respond right away to correction. It's not as bad
as it was before I had the front end work, but my '65 splitty responds
better than the camper. It has a full pop-top.

Any suggestions appreciated.

Jason
