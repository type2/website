Hmmmmmmmmm.......
 First, Volks Cafe (now Van Cafe as of this week). Now this.
 The BS just keeps rollin' on & on & on & on..........
 No wonder they can't put out a good product anymore. Seems like they spend
the majority of their time doin' crappy legal stuff and not concentrating on
customer satisfaction or their wants.
 [big sigh]
