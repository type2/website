It's not mentioned in Doliwa or the Bentley manual.

Maybe somebody cut the wheel wells for big tires, and then somebody else
welded in replacements from a donor Bus?  If the replacement piece was
just big enough to cover the hole, you might be able to see the joint
from the engine compartment, but an enthusastic person might have
replaced the whole side panel - cargo door to corner seam, belt line
to bottom.  A really gung-ho guy might have gone all the way to the
roof line.  At any rate, maybe the replacement panels were welded in
just slightly higher than stock.
