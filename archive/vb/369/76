I have received a number of e-mails regarding an auto cut off relay for my
fuel pump. I failed to mention I do have an ignition triggered type, engine
stalls pump shuts down. Here is a link that describes how to install one.

I don't like the idea of only having an inertia type switch as it will only
be tripped in the event of an accident. Cars with that type of switch also
have an ingition triggered relay which IMHO consider more important.

I used an inertia switch from a Ford Aerostar. They are located behind
the front passenger side kick panel (for those folks who frequent
self-serve wrecking yards). I wouldn't run an electric fuel pump without
some sort of safety switch.

E&B are right about the safety issue of an electric pump running on in
the event of an accident or stall. You could even add a
resettable crash sensor, like a modern car.
