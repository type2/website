Subject: Rear wheelwell...?

Hi all,

  I was wondering if anyone knew if the wheelwells were modified at any time
during production for my 67 bus?  It seems like mine are cut a little higher
up than most of the other ones I see, but it does'nt look like someone
modified it.  There's still that small lip on the bottom that is exactly
like all the other ones I've seen.  It just looks like they made it higher
up?  Does anyone know how I can tell for sure?   Thanks much!  Aloha,  JD
