Clara,
	I remember participating at a vw bus camp Burning Man '99 meeting 
when Coyote Ron and others were planning the VW Bus trip down to the 
bottom of South America.  It was a great meeting of international travel 
ideas and bus bs.  They left from Burning Man in 2000 and on the trip 
down and I waved goodbye along the 95 between LV and Kingsman, AZ.  They 
blew past me fast in their Syncros.
	I put VW Bus Camp registration together for this past burn at 
Burning Man and I met and dealt with many of the VW bus generational 
issues. They do not exist in the real world.  VW bus friends will help 
out what ever.  Also, many everyday problems like "tires" are a common 
plague.  So, a wandering 1974 camper is not welcome?
