2/0 gauge, also called 00 guage, is half again as thick as 2 guage.  It's
really stiff stuff and might be hard to fit through the tin without
enlarging the existing hole. Here's a web reference table:

The guage you are interested in is AWG.

Frankly, the VW engine is very small and doesn't need a huge amount of
starting current.  Additionally, the starter cable on the VW is quite
short compared to a typical Chevy.  A 2-guage cable should be plenty, even
at 6V.
