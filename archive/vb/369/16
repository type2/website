Subject: 1967 VW van For Sale

Hi

I have a 1967 VW van for sale in Orangeville Ontario
Canada.    The van runs but the frame and 1/4 panels
are VERY rusted.  The floor is in good shape.  There
is no interior.  Would make a good parts van or could
be restored for someone that can weld and has some
time over the winter.If anyone is interested please
email me and I will send you some pics.

Thanks
Jimmy
