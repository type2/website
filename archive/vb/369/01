Subject: Re: [VB] Balancing Tires....... The Conclusion

So, what is the solution? Hoover says you can't straighten wide five 
stock rims. What is the best (in price and strenghth) replacement wheel? 
Porsche alloys? After market wheels? The last splitty with wide fives 
that left my driveway, a '65 camper, developed very loose wheels after a 
150 mile drive to it's new home. What is the cure for the everyday driver?
