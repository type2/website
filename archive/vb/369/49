Subject: Re: [VB] VW want to remove entusiast site

If you have a complaint - you need to complain to your lawmakers.  If VW or 
Disney or anyone else does not vigorously defend their copyrights and 
trademarks then that intellectual property goes into the public domain and 
anyone can use it.  At least now if you buy a part with the vw logo you can 
be pretty sure it is a vw part - once that trademark becomes part of the 
public domain then anyone could legitimately manufacture parts with the vw 
logo.  I'm kinda surprised that you do not get this.

Start up a site using a Toyota trademark and see how long it takes for 
Toyota to come after you.
