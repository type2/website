Subject: Re: [VB] Balancing Tires....... The Conclusion

I've had them straightened before without a  problem.....unless this has
something to do with putting another set of tires on them.

If you want another wheel issue to worry about, take a look at the bolt
holes on some used rims. After years of tightening, loose bolts, amd impact
guns a lot of them start looking slightly oval in appearance. Something else
to look for in checking used rims.....
