Ray,

I had a similar flooding problem a couple summers ago.  Bus was
running great, but would flood after sitting for a few hours to
overnight.  The oil would also take on a strong gasoline odor after
just a few hundred miles.  Finally traced the problem to my gas cap- I
lost the original and the one that I replaced it with wasn't vented.
The tank soaked up heat from the engine, gases expanded, tank pressure
equilibrated by forcing fuel through the needle valve in the carb.  I
realize that later buses have evaporative emissions, but it's possible
that a vent line or charcoal cannister is plugged and causing your
problem.

E&B are right about the safety issue of an electric pump running on in
the event of an accident or stall.   Most carbureted cars with
electric fuel pumps have a relay that shuts the fuel pump off when the
engine stops.   One type is connected to the oil pressure sender and
only energizes the fuel pump when you have oil pressure.  A second
type needs a tach signal from the points or igniter, it turns the pump
off when the distributor stops turning.   You could even add a
resettable crash sensor, like a modern car.
