a friend who just drove off in his 80s mercedes biodiesel station 
wagon was discussing this with me... he was able to walk into the 
local dealer (north snottsdale, az - think gucci time!) and get 
parts. ANY parts, back to a freakin 50s model if he'd wait a few 
days. most were in stock, in duplicate.  porsche has a similar 
program. vw? well, they got their comeuppance with the phaeton: NO 
ONE wanted an $80,000 vw.  their sales overall have plummeted, in 
large part due to quality control issues.

i do have to admit tho - if i had money to piss in a box, i'd have a 
V10  diesel toureg in a HEARTBEAT! i watched a video of one out at 
moab utah, and the german driver was making the passengers wet their 
pants he was taking such steep inclines... SIDEWAYS.  goats were 
falling off the rocks before the car slid.  but the reviewers all 
said: who the hell is gonna take a 60K+  car on an actual mountain??? 
all the ones here in yuppiedumb are the cheaper gas V6. not too many 
of em, either.

vw - a car company in search of an identity.
