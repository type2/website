We are working on a 65 that has a secondary plate on the passenger
side of the center overhead vent duct. Haven't looked to see if this
differs from the one behind the passenger seat.

 A buddy of mine found a flip seat out in rural Nebraska and now we are
 looking for the m code plate!   Where would it be when there is no
 bulkhead!
 Thanks
