OH BOY, a physics discussion!  :)

Ah, but you are assuming that the acceleration is constant, which it
isn't.  If you wind up that engine and drop the clutch you can actually
break the tires loose for an instant.  Assuming a coefficient of friction
of 0.8 and 60% of the bus weight supported by the rear axle you get:

9.81*0.8*0.6=

*calculator not handy, bring up Google, cut and paste...*

 4.70m/(s^2) or nearly half a g!  Gut wrenching, yes, but not for very
long!
