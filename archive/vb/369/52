Subject: RE: [VB] VW want to remove entusiast site

I believe all you have to do is go to vwoa and ask permission, fill out
a few forms and most likely you'll get an ok.  All they want to do is
keep track and control.  At least, for some reason, I remember that VW
recently started having this stance regarding their trademark.
