Actually this is not the spray type foam(like good stuff or icynene). It is
like the foam you might use for cushions, but it was about 1" thick. It
appeared to have been adhered with some type of adhesive brushed on to the
bus metal, than the foam adhered to that. Most of it came off pretty
cleanly, but I would like to get it cleaner, so I can deal with any rust,
and also have a good clean surface to apply more modern sound deadening
materials.

That depends on the compound...

I assume we're talking about a spray-foam type of foam?   Bob Hoover used 
to recommend Naptha for that.   Acetone might work, easy enough to test...

Obviously take safety precautions.  No flame/sparks, wear a good 
respirator, plenty of ventilation, gloves, etc.
