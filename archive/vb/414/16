Subject: fs: 40 hp cyl head core

Cleaning up again..

I have dozens of Cyl heads ready to be rebuilt...  they are bare cores, no
valves, or valve train..

They are Vw Aircooled 40 hp single port bug engine heads.
113-101-373D castings

they are clean.. possibly bead blasted..
this style of cyl head..  this is a reasonable facsimile.

on the scrap scale, they are about $10.00
