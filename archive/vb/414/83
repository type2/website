Subject: RE: [VB] taking it apart

One thought I had when making the panels in the rear section, and on the
roof of my bus. The original are some sort of thin plywood with a fake wood
veneer. When I started re-making these for other areas of the bus, I was
using Baltic Birch Plywood. Which I think looks very nice.

I thought of possibly drilling a lot of holes in these panels. A lot of very
small holes. Then the sound dampening material behind the panels. Then the
panels should act almost like acoustic ceiling tile. The small holes should
allow break up the sound waves, and any soft material I put behind the
panels will absorb the sound. I'm not sure about this hole idea, I think it
will work. I'm just not sure how well it will work, and how labor intensive
drilling all those holes would be. It could also make cleaning the panels a
bit tougher. 

Probably something like 1/16" holes, done in some sort of pattern. For those
of you with regular headliners, I would try to make holes like those present
in  your headliner.

Has anyone ever tried something like this?
