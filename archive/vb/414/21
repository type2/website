Subject: Engine drone

Hi,

I have a Weber progressive carb on my bus with the requisit aftermarket 
intake and air filter (6" dia round pleated paper). Dual port, 1776, stock 
pea shooter exhaust.

Could the engine drone noise be coming up out of the intake system? The 
heavy droning noise starts at around 60mph (~3150rpm)

Thanks,
Chris
