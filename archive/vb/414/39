Subject: How to Hot Wire a VW Bus

I have a 1969 VW Bus and I need to know how to hot wire it. My  
ignition switch is shot but I need to get it started tonight. Any  
pointers would be greatly appreciated. I believe my ignition switch  
has 4 wires (one is for the buzzer, which my bus does not have so it  
isn't hooked up I think it is grey).

Cheers,
Isaac Tait
