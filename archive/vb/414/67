Subject: Brake pedal pivot clip & washer lost 

In rehabilitating and relubricating the brake pedal pivot on my 65, I  
didn't properly install the c-clip/lock ring that fits over the right  
end of the pivot shaft.  The clip and washer popped off and were lost  
on the road. :-(

Parts 32 and 33 in this illustration: http://vintagebus.com/parts/

Listed as:
N 11 567 1 Washer 17
N 12 416 1 Lockring 16x1

The lock ring looks like this: http://www.wolfsburgwest.com/cart/

I have one from the left (outside) end of a clutch cross shaft that  
looks right - in fact, I think they are the same part.  I think I can  
get a washer to fit the shaft.

But does anyone know a source for these items?  Or have a couple of  
good used ones they'll part with?  It may happen again, so I want to  
have spares on hand.

Thanks in advance,
