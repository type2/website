Come
over to the main building and help dress up the BusFusion canines for a
parade and contest. Bring goodies to decorate your doggies. There will be
prizes for various categories (should that be dogegories?) and the parade
itself is definitely worth seeing. Here are some pics --- including a bunch

Potts. This is a collaborative affair rather than a catered one  so bring
an ingredient and come help setup/cook/cleanup and have a great breakfast
with your bus buddies. Weve got a big fridge in the main building to store
ingredient contributions so you dont have to worry about space in your
cooler or Dometic.*

by fond farewells and cleanup of the site (for which we are seeking
volunteers). *
