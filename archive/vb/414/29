Subject: RE: [VB] window latch for a 60

I need one for a 60 .. those ones with the golf tee kinda things on em are
wrong for me .. like ones from a 65 or 66 for sure are wrong. But if you
have one that is right for a 60 let me know. 

I do not have a latch for a DC .. but send me details and tell me how much
you'd pay and I may find one next weekend .. (I'm going here: 

http://www.volksworld.com/vwshow.html) I'll grab it for you .. I do have a
62 devon in a wrecker .. I never thought to look as to what kind of latches
it has ... 

Thanks for the offer .. if it is the right one I'll be glad to put it to
good use ..

I will give u one but it would need to be plated. Any chance u have a  
gate latch for my 66 DC?

Just send me address and I will mail one to you. It is in decent shape  
and would need to be chromed for show but it's decent.
