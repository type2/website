Hi John,

You are pretty much looking at tar products here. What I like better
than roofing tar is swamp cooler coating because it has anti-rust
additives to protect the swamp cooler from rusting out. The same dept
sells an applicator brush. It's pretty stiff, so putting it on is
somewhat slow going. They sell the same product in an aerosol can, but
it is not as thick and oily, so I don't get the impression it will
protect as well. I also used the spray on undercoating from FLAPS. I
did a whole bug interior and underside with that. Seemed to work well,
and gave a good quite ride, but I don't have the vehicle anymore, so I
don't know how the rust proofing qualities compare with swamp cooler
coating.

 using roofing tar? Or that black tar-like stuff you spread on the exterior
 of foundations? Both of these products sure seem like dried up tar to me?
