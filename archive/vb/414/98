Subject: re:getting the foam out

Well I found those 3M discs from a local autobody store. They also
recommended some adhesive dissolver product. The combination worked great, I
did go through a whole box of the pads, and I still have not tackled the
panels over the front seats.

The good things about these 3M pads, I believe they are designed to scuff
the surface for painting. So now I've scuffed almost everywhere, so the
interior is almost ready for a quick primer/topcoat. The existing paint is
generally in great condition

I'd say one more day and I will have it prepped enough to bring to my
mechanic to begin the body work.
