The hard surfaces of the tiles will be a great place for reflections (not what you want). 



While testing the sound inside my bus we found that it got really messy close to the wood headliner in the front, the difference between shoulder level and ear level was pretty dramatic, meaning that some nice squishy foam on this hard reflective surface would help reduce reflections and SPL reinforcements. 




My question ... someone mentioned to me that the stick on sound deadening 
stuff is pretty much like stick on floor tiles .. I'm thinking what if I had 
some floor tiles .. heated em up .. and used either contact cement or spray 
on adhesive .. I'm sure that would work pretty must like one of the kinds of 
sound deadening stuff ...
