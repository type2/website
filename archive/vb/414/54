Subject: Diagram of drivers door interior

I just bought a 66 Westy and I'm having problems with the driver's  
door.  The door wont open from the inside because the latch and  
connecting rod were disassembled at some point.  I need put the  
handle, control arm, and latch mechanism back together but I can't  
find any sort of diagram that shows me how they go together.  The  
task is made harder because I'm working blind trying to get this  
thing together behind one of the door panels.  I've seen the parts  
diagram from the link below, but (just my luck), that page of the  
scanned manual is just too fuzzy to read.  Anybody got a suggestion?

Thanks
Jim
