Subject: getting the foam out

Well, I tried a couple compounds/toxins for removing the foam stuck to the
sheet metal, without much success. The best thing appears to be this 3M type
scouring pad. I just rub like hell on an area and it crumbles the foam, and
turns it to dust. I don't know why they don't make something like this I
could put on my random orbit sander.

I am trying to break the problem down into discrete sections. So I feel like
I am making progress. I have about 6 sections done. The roof appears to be
the toughest-as it is hard to get leverage.

I hope to have all the foam out by the end of the weekend. And also to have
figured out how to remove the ceiling panels above the front seats. If I
can't figure out a way to remove them as is, I will probably try to give
them a clean cut down the middle, and then put back together to use as a
template. I hope to be able to template everything with this roll of thin
cardboard I have, that way I can do some test-fitting.

I also ordered a bunch of second skin damplifier and luxury liner to put in
after the body work is done. I ordered today as I was forwarded a great
coupon from Chris D.
