Wow, you had new seals only 5 years ago and they are cracked and breaking already?


That is pretty lame.?? Are they WW seals??? I don't know of any others available, but that doesn't mean they aren't out there.

Thanks Clara and Tristan for the info.?

?

Yep, I know the king pins inside and out. Had'em apart a couple of times. Just really disappointed that I need to take'm apart just for seals that are only about 5 years old. The previous seals musta been 20 years old and nary a crack. And yep, the link pin adjustment's been done lots of times.?

Good info on the grease, and it is easier to pump it into the king and link pins when the front end is off the ground.?
