I just saw this incredibly well done video analysis of Little Red Riding
Hood, very entertaining for geeks.

In the middle of it, she crosses the road, and a VW  bus drives by, and the
video does a quick analysis of the bus, with cut away views etc. It is very
entertaining, and worthy of a Friday afternoon viewing.

I guess it is called animated videographics..
