looks to me as if those last numbers may be the size, ie 17mm, 16x1mm.

btw I have dealt with Wolfsburg West and can really recommend them.  I 
needed a positive battery cable, with the voltage reg wire too. The 
catalog showed it with the long 42" wire needed for the bug, and I 
didnt want to fold it up or cut it myself. They MADE one for my 71 T2, 
I think it is only 16 or so inches. No cost, and they have better 
crimpers.  I think they may now offer that length for T2s.

They might ship that washer&clip for you at letter rate :-)
