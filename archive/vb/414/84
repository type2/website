Subject: Re: [VB] taking it apart

Kevin,

The swiss cheese panel approach can work, but the hole spacing will be 
something like 1/8 inch appart to be effective. Lets see, 1 foot square with 
holes on 1/8" spacing, 9,216 holes/ square foot. Even with `1/4 inch spacing 
its 2304/ square foot. Not too practical.
