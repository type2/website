Subject: sound deadening

I bought one package of sound deadening stuff from Napa in Napanee - cost
about $40 a pack - 9 sheets about 16" x 7" - bought 2 more packs from Napa
in Kingston about $31 per pack - 6 sheets 12" x 12". Stuff from Kingston was
called Evercoat (I think) there was no name on the stuff from Napanee. The
stuff from Napanee is thicker and more rubbery. Anyway has anyone tried just
using roofing tar? Or that black tar-like stuff you spread on the exterior
of foundations? Both of these products sure seem like dried up tar to me?
