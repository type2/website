Wrapping the intake manifold with insulation would help weber cold
weather performance and might help your drone. I recall having heard
before that webers are loud.

 I'm fairly sure it is the engine. When I put it into neutral and coast, most
 of the noise goes away. I can also, in gear, play with the throttle and make
 the noise increase and decrease depending on the load applied. It seems
 noisiest when running on the flat, constant speed, above 60mph (96.77kph). I
 guess that equates to a light to medium load.
