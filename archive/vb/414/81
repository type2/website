Subject: taking it apart

Well after having had my bus for over 10 years(wow), it is over 40 years
old. I have been saving a little bit for years to finally have some body
work done. I was basically just keeping ahead of the maintenance issues(with
help from the list of course).

I'm in the process of taking the cabinets apart and out. I had rebuilt some
of them a few years back. They have held up pretty well. I plan on finishing
the re-building of the cabinets, then re-finishing them all. 

While everything is out and after the body work is done, I hope to do a lot
of soundproofing, sound dampening stuff. I have read a lot over the years,
and plan on going through all my notes on the subject.

I am trying to photo stuff as I take it apart, so I can remember how to put
it all back together.

I am not going for a show winner, but rather, I'd like to get the big dents
out, and deal with rust issues. I will hopefully not get too carried away,
as I want to be able to go camping with this thing. 

My mechanic's shop also does body work. It is not the best work you can have
done, but I've seen his work and it looks decent enough to me. This is
supposed to be an affordable peoples car, right?

I'll try to keep you posted, and probably pester you with questions as I go.


I am very excited about tackling the rust issues and sound deadening. I
realize how tiring driving in a loud bus can be.
