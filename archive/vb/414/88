When you are talking about organic compounds that have age hardened, I
don't think you are going to be able to dissolve it unless you use
something really aggressive like paint stripper.

 Behind all the panels is some yellow foam of varying thicknesses and various
 state of rot. Although about 90% of it is ok. But I still want to remove it
 all and install a better foam. Most of it cam out pretty easily, but there
 is still about 10% that is stuck. Any suggestions on removing this stuff? I
 was just going to go at it with some plastic puty knives, but thought there
 may be some chemical that would make the removal more complete and easier.
 Something like acetone, or pain thinner? Any ideas-I'm open to them.

 Thanks,
