I think they do make discs like that:

You would have to change the backing pad in your sander if it uses the
stick-on pads.  If you are going to bare metal, an alternative is to
use a wire cup brush in a 4 1/2" angle grinder.  I like the brush for
removing paint and rust because it's quick and doesn't clog like a
sanding disc.  Just be sure to wear the proper gear, the wire bristles
tend to break off at speed and embed themselves in your clothes.
