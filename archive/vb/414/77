Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Front end grease.

Thanks Clara and Tristan for the info.

Yep, I know the king pins inside and out. Had'em apart a couple of times. 
Just really disappointed that I need to take'm apart just for seals that are 
only about 5 years old. The previous seals musta been 20 years old and nary 
a crack. And yep, the link pin adjustment's been done lots of times.

Good info on the grease, and it is easier to pump it into the king and link 
pins when the front end is off the ground.

shop. Had forgotten how much I enjoyed driving her!
