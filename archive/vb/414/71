The parts manual knows all.  :)

All of the "N xx xxx x" parts are "Normteile" or standard parts, at
least in Germany.  It's kind of like Chevy saying "look, we aren't
going to make a GM part number for this, go get a SAE Grade 5 1/4-20 x
1" hex head bolt at the hardware store."  If you look down in Main
Group 0 of the parts manual, there are listings of the Normteile.
Often these listings have a little more information; in this case,
http://vintagebus.com/parts/5867part/641.png says the first one is
a "Washer 17 DIN 433" and http://vintagebus.com/parts/5867part/643.png
says the second one is a "Lock ring 16x1 DIN 471".  The DIN numbers
are Deutsche Industrie Normen - German Industrial Standards and Google
is your friend.  Googling DIN 433 shows vendors for the washers, and
DIN 471 shows vendors for the lock rings.

Of course some of these people only want to sell you 10,000 at a time;
places like Maryland Metrics will deal in smaller quantities.
http://mdmetric.com/fastindx/chapterf.htm seems to be the relevant
page; http://mdmetric.com/fastindx/uf06_13.pdf has the DIN 433 washer
at (if I am reading it correctly) $9.80 for 100 (black), $10.90 for
100 (zinc plated), or $11.20 for 100 (yellow zinc plated).  If you
are making a Schwimmbus, http://mdmetric.com/fastindx/uf83_87.pdf
has A2 stainless steel at $28.00 for 100, or A4 stainless steel at
$50.10 for 100.  (No, I don't know what the difference is either.)
For the 23-window Deluxe Schwimmbus,
http://mdmetric.com/fastindx/uf70_75.pdf has plain brass at $62.00 for
100 or even nickel-plated brass at $65.50 for 100.

For the lock ring, http://mdmetric.com/fastindx/uf58_67.pdf has them
at (if I am reading it correctly) $6.30 for 100 (black) or $9.20 for
100 (dacromet plated (What the hell is a dacromet?  Is that like a
Dacron voice?  "I'm not dumb but I can't understand, why parts fall
off while I'm driving the van, Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-la..."))  At
http://mdmetric.com/fastindx/uf97_103.pdf you can step on up to
stainless steel at $58.00 for 100.

Achtung baby!  I have never ordered anything from Maryland Metrics;
I just know that they exist and have their catalog online.  There are
probably other vendors that provide a similar service.  In a bigger
city there may even be a metric hardware distributor with a "will
call" counter.

I hope this helps!
