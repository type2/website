CIP1 has king pin seals, probably other vendors also carry them:

The Bentley calls for multi-purpose lithium grease and then lists the
desired physical characteristics (like melting point > 170 C).  I have
been using Mobil XHP222, which is NLGI-2.  If you want something
thicker, you might want an NGLI-3 grease, like XHP223.  It might be
difficult to get the thicker grease into the zerks, though.
