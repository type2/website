Subject: Clearance sale on Funky Green Metal

I'm getting rid of my stock of Funky Green Panels for Split busses. I'll not
be getting more for resale. We are refocusing back to the metal shop and
have openings coming up for that shop real soon . With VWwomack back
turnaround time is decreasing rapidly, we may have some other stuff in the
works, more on that later. See the samba ad below for a list of what I have
left. If it's not listed then I don't have it and won't get it. 

The prices are rock bottom and firm.  Might consider some trading for a
narrowed  CB beam for my 15 window.
