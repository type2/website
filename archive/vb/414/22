Subject: Alternator Face/Bearing Housing

Greetings Volks,

This weekend I was installing my new porsche pulley on my alternator 
and I made a total dumb *$$ mistake: I didn't think the new pulley 
half was seated all the way against the face of the pulley and I tapped
it with a hammer.

The result: I pushed in the metal in the middle of the alternator 
face - not much, but you can see that it's deformed a little.  (I'll send a
picture later).  GRRR.

Everything still spins fine without getting hung up or anything, but in
the interest of long-term reliability (and not getting stranded on 600+ mile
journies), I'm thinking this should probably be fixed?  I'm assume that I 
just need a new "alternator face", but how can I go about finding a 
replacement?  Is this is a rebuilders part only?

Any thoughts on the matter, including on how worried I should be about 
replacing this, are welcome.

This is on a single-port, type-1 engine with a 55amp bosch alternator.

Cheers,
    Tom
