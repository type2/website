Buses By the Beach.com is an organization that solely exists to raise money
for the Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors.  www.
<http://www.phoenix-society.org/> phoenix-society.org/  And the selling of
these T-shirts is the primary source of funds for our giving. So we would
like to encourage everyone in the VW Community to consider purchasing a
really cool shirt even if you can't make it to our event. Thankfully our
sponsors cover the cost of making the shirts so 100% of the selling price
goes to our The Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors.
