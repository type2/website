Subject: Re: [VB] How to Hot Wire a VW Bus

Easiest way is to connect a wire from LR taillight running light to the power side of the coil.? Then just push start it with running lights on, but make sure the ignition key is turned to run position to keep the steering unlocked.
? When you get to your destination turn off the running lights to shut off the engine.
