Subject: Re: [VB] Diagram of drivers door interior

Jim,

If you can wait for the weekend, I can open up my door panel and send you a 
photo.

I just bought a 66 Westy and I'm having problems with the driver's
 door.  The door wont open from the inside because the latch and
 connecting rod were disassembled at some point.  I need put the
 handle, control arm, and latch mechanism back together but I can't
 find any sort of diagram that shows me how they go together.  The
 task is made harder because I'm working blind trying to get this
 thing together behind one of the door panels.  I've seen the parts
 diagram from the link below, but (just my luck), that page of the
 scanned manual is just too fuzzy to read.  Anybody got a suggestion?

 Thanks
 Jim
