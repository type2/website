Subject: Re: [VB] transaxle swap

Well, I drove my '59 bus into work today after swapping the transaxle out 
with another used '67 one I had that was supposed to be good. I've been 
messing with it at home 'cause it seems to exibit the exact same problems 
the one I had in there did. It's all that "2nd" and "reverse" stuff. 
Sometimes when in reverse it pops out into a "mystery spot". Shifting into 
second is rough and will many times want to grind. Sometimes wants to pop 
out of 2nd.

So now I'm thinking more than ever that the problem is somewhere 
else....like in the shifting part of the system. I've adjusted the shifter 
plate many many times and can never seem to work the problem out. I've 
inspected the shifter plate and compared it with pictures and one from 
another bus and it appears to be fine...but I couldn't really say for sure.

Maybe I've got the shift plate installed wrong? Which way does the tab go?

Maybe the plate is bad all-together? Does anyone carry these new?

Maybe the shiftrod is bent? It definatly sits higher than the tranny 
nose-cone. I have had to wrestle it a bit to get the couplers on in the past.

Isn't there a front shift coupler? How do you check and change that?

Really seems like something might just be mis-alined in all this. I put all 
new tranny mounts and everything back there is tight. The "new" transaxle 
didn't leak like my other and the nose-cone seemed much more tight.

Any other ideas?

If it turns out that this tranny is just a twinkie to the other..so be it. 
But I hate to spend big money on a new tranny, install it, then have it do 
the same things. Especially when I'm planning to sell the bus. I've put 
enough money into it and really don't want to do any more. If I can't get 
the problem worked out with the current tranny, it'll just have to stay in 
there for a while.
