Looks like main bearing residue to me. Cases don't flake. Hippies do.
Bearings are shiny and not magnetic. Whatever the source , the case must be split
and the cooler cleaned very well or replaced, these shavings will destroy your engine.

I'm powdercoating my cases silver. Looks kewl. Overheating comes from
too hot oil. Paint your proper running engine case blue imetalflake if you like.

Ouch.

Verify oil pressure, if you dare run it some more.
