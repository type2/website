Subject: Re: [T2] Rap on distributors

Here are a couple tips that are often not followed.

1) proper ignition timing depends on the distributor used, NOT ON THE
ENGINE.

2) The distributor must match the carb(s) for the proper vacuum signal. It's
different from 71' and newer compared to 70' and earlier.

3) be CAREFUL on "trusting" the timing marks on pulleys. Pulleys have often
been switched around, and the timing notches in the pulleys are in different
places for different years. Index it to be sure. This includes aluminum
pulleys, which are often indexed improperly!
