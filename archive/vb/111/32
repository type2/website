Allrighty, I'm in Nor-Cal. I can't find Vredestein ifno online anymore, so 
I'll pull it off the tire tomorrow.

I'd like to see $200 for the tires alone, and only an extra $50 for the 
rims. The tires have about 10-15K on them, and eare in excellent condition. 
Rims are approximately the same age as the tires, and have only surface rust 
on them(steel wool removes it all).

I just limped my sore butt outside to take a look at them. THey are 
195-70-R15 7-ply 97T rated. T rating is up to 118MPH. I finally found a 
little info on the tires online here: http://www.tyreland.co.nz/t-trac.html

Lemme know. I'd prefer to sell both wheels and tires together...it'll save 
you the tire removal fee(and I'll not have them laying around :-] ). The 
rims are just Chromie wide-5 stocker rims. They'll accept stock hubcaps.

Oh, one other thing...these tires have only been stored outside about 3 
months, so it's not like they've sat outside.
