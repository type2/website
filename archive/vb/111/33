Subject: trouble shooting my tranny problems...looking for help.

I recently transfered a used tranny to my '59 bus. The old one 
grinded going into second and would pop out of reverse.

The used one I put in was from a '67 bus. I was told it was good. It 
shows the same problems....grinding going into second, popping out of 
reverse....also pops out of second occasionally if not shifted in 
there good.

Although I know ultimatly the used tranny could just be broken in the 
same way as the one I pulled out, I'm trying to trouble shoot the 
rest of the shifting system to make sure it's nothing there. I don't 
plan on buying a new tranny...but if I did, I'd hate to install it 
and end up right where I'm at now.

One thing I notice is that where my shift rod comes out at the 
tranny, it is forced to the lower drivers' side of the shift rod 
tube. Going down the tube I see a place that could be bent.

I'm able to push the tube up and to the middle and connect it to the 
tranny with the coupling. It's not a lot of force to do it, but it's 
less than the other shift rods that are in my other busses. Those 
just about flop loose in the shift rod tube.

So could this be enough to wreak havok on my shifting...maybe causing 
my problems with second/reverse? Or is the force not really gonna 
affect things at the tranny shifter?

Anyone ever dealt with a bent shift rod? What are the symptoms?

Thanks.
