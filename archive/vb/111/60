Hi John,
1.  Most volks are not into picking through a mountain of info to get there 
VWs running properly instead of just running.  Heck we have found the 
majority of centrifugal distributor owners do not know they need to drop a 
couple of drops of engine oil under the rotor to keep the advance wieghts 
lubricated properly every 3,000 miles!

2.  Most volks are happier with the idea of band aiding than fixing the real 
problem.  IE problem with headlights or starting?  Then just install a relay 
to fix one electrical problem instead of fixing the real cause of the voltage 
drop and have all the electricals work properly.

3.  The magazines say it will give you more HP and works better cause thier 
advertiseres sell them!

4.  It is a low budget part that replaces the original now gooed up and/or 
worn out vaccum distributors from 1938-2002 carbed engines instead of fixing 
them or even more often they just need cleaning/lubricating them.  Kind of 
like installing a new motor every 3,000 miles instead of just investing the 
time to time and tune an engine every 3,000 miles!  The centrifugal 
distributor does not have to be designed to work with the vaccum which is 
differant in each model of carb and even affected somewhat by size of engine, 
so they can be manufacutured for any year and type of non-FI VW and sold to a 
much larger market than otherwise.

We have been using old 010s for many years and have been meaning to try out 
vaccum advance distributors to see if they do improve oil temps and still 
keep the torque up!
