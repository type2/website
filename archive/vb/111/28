Yes - you have to push the little catch at the top down.  It's at
the back (ie the mounting plate) and is spring-loaded.  It's a b*tch
with the semi in the car. 

Pry the semaphore up until you get a little resistance, then feel for 
a low spot just in front of the back plate, while pishing down.

You'll see a pivot point around the plunger - that's where you're pushing
