Subject: FW: [VB] More on NOS round mirrors.  I need some help.

Matt, the best way to verify if you have an NOS mirror is to send it to me
and I'll take a look at it on
my bus...heh heh heh.  Seriously, I think there were a few different
suppliers of those round mirrors
so all original mirrors are not exactly alike.  I bought a sweet mirror last
year at the Octo meet, took it 
home to compare it to another mirror I had and they are definately
different, but I'm pretty sure they are both 
original.  This is just a theory of mine.  Anyone else have any input on
this?
