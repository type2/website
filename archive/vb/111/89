I think this is one of the "self locking" starter/engine bolts.  You
undo the nut on the engine side (working in front (FRONT) of the fan
housing) then pull the bolt out from the starter side to free the
starter.
 
>How do i read the wire gauge in the wiring diagram? is it mm diameter?

It is in square millimeter cross section.  A wire marked "1" is 1 mm^2
in cross section, or about 1.13 mm diameter.  If you're trying to
figure out what American Wire Gauge size to use, try this:

Metric   American
mm**2    Wire Gauge
 0.5     20
 0.75    18
 1.0     16
 1.5     14
 2.5     12
 4.0     10
 6.0      8
25.0      2

You can't go wrong by using a size a little bigger than you think
you need.  Personally I wouldn't use anything smaller than 16 gauge,
especially in a Bus that was still 6 V.
 
>How do i find out what the fuse amps are?

If the fuses are plastic or ceramic with the element on the outside,
the plastic or ceramic will be colored: white for 8 amp, red for 16
amp, and blue for 25 amp - split Buses never used 25 amp fuses as
far as I know but that style of fuse is available in that rating.
If the fuses are little glass tubes with pointy metal ends, the
rating will be stamped into one of the end caps.

To find out what you are supposed to have, check the color wiring 
diagrams on vintagebus.com - each fuse is color coded white and
red for 8 or 16 amps.  Your '56 originally would have used all 8
amp fuses.
 
>Are the black bars across fuse 3 & 4, and across 5 & 6 jumpers?

Yes.  On the fuse boxes I have seen these aren't wire jumpers
from terminal to terminal, but part of the stamped metal terminals
themselves.
