Subject: Advance curve?

  With all this talk of distributors-
  What is the the consensus (yeah right) on the ideal 
advance curve? Start advancing just off idle to full 
advance (33 degrees?) at what rpm?
  I'm running an MSD unit (centrifugal, magnetic 
pickups) on my dual-carbed 1776 and I can customize the 
advance curve.
 I know ymmv and all that, but I want an idea of where 
to start that will get me in the ballpark.
