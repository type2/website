 Ok I bought the bus as a quasi project, its runs and drives (sorta) but sat 
 for a long time and needs lots of things.
 Thing #1 - it needs a master cylinder. Ive changed these on bugs before and 
 thought nothing of it, until seeing that its 1 yr only and $195 at bus-boys! 
  Anyone rebuild these? Its literally pouring fluid out of the shaft...
=============
yup, that's what they cost.  I had found rebuild kits at NAPA, but I'd take 
it apart and inspect it as the cylinder may be pitted and beyond rebuild- it 
you don't know how to tell the difference buy a new one.    the front of the 
bus looks pretty straight right now.
..........................
 thing #2 - Needs shift bushings, sloppy (doesnt pop out of any gears tho), 
 one in the front, what about the coupler in the rear, where is it and how 
 hard to get to? (whole job..)?
=========
buy a bentley reprint of the 1963 transporter workshop manual.   Slopping 
shifting is usually the fault mainly of the rear shift coupler,  lay under 
the bus, looking just in front of the tranny, while a friend wiggles the 
shift stick side to side- the bit from the front of the bus and the bit from 
the tranny should be held firmly in the coupler, no wiggle.  use safety wire 
when installing a new one- through the holes in the screws- if a screw falls 
out you get stuck in gear.  :(

 I think thats the short list for now.. has a few valdez sized oil leaks too 
 but those i can resolve with a quick once over on the motor i

sounds like the bus has delayed maintenace- sounds like its time for a 
thorough 60K mi maintenace-  check fuel line, tranny boots, change oil in 
tranny (inclu RGBoxes) repack wheel bearings, adjust link pins, how old are 
brake hoses?, inspect brakes in all wheels, etc etc etc.
