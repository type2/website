Subject: Re: [T2] Rap on distributors

I really appreciate all the input but am beginning to think no one knows the
answer.
The question was:

The Big Question: What makes a distributor correct for a certain year? Is it
the case? Is it the number of ports? Is it the crank? What changes on the
1600 engine occurred over the years to require a different distributor???

Thanks for all the replies!
