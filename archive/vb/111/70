SVDA works best with a 34PICT-3 which it was set up for. I have not noticed
any difference in running with a stock good 34PICT and one that I have
jetted. The vacuum seems to remain constant for both carbs.

As for indexing, you are referring to confirmation of tdc by physical
means, I imagine? Onld dowel in the no 1?>
Any resource to what is required vac signal for each dizzy/carb?
Any specs available to check out an old dizzy with, at the shaft
primarily? I have a 205 from a 69 bus, with a working vac can (if you
apply vac, it moves), and appears to be solid, but I don't know how to
tell if it's worn too much, they all seem floppy at the drive interface,
so I assume there is a clearance between the shims/washers at the end of
the shafts?
What carbs/vac signals are the SVDAs best for considering the above
statement.

Here are a couple tips that are often not followed.

1) proper ignition timing depends on the distributor used, NOT ON THE
ENGINE.

2) The distributor must match the carb(s) for the proper vacuum signal.
It's different from 71' and newer compared to 70' and earlier.

3) be CAREFUL on "trusting" the timing marks on pulleys. Pulleys have
often been switched around, and the timing notches in the pulleys are in
different places for different years. Index it to be sure. This includes
aluminum pulleys, which are often indexed improperly!
