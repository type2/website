Subject: .009, There MUST be some advantages

Someone (Steve Dolan??) stated earlier that they checked 10 early bays at EB and ALL had .009 dizzys. I have owned 3 different buses with T1 engines, and ALL of these had .009.  Yet the general consensus is that these are BAD.  SO the big question then is "If the .009 is obviously bad, then why the hell does nearly everyone with a T1 engine in an early bay have this set-up?!?!?!"  It must be more than cost and availability.  In the service records of my 71 Westy (I have all records since new, thank JAH God or whomever for Previous Owners who actually took great care of the bus!!) I have a receipt where the PO had a reputable shop in Virginia (I think it was VA) remove the old dizzy and install the .009 set-up. SO WHY HAVE SO MANY DONE THIS IF IT IS UN-ARGUABLY BAD????
