Hey Bob,

Short version:  Yeah the roof was extremely rusted out, but everything below
the belt drip rail was in good shape.  Got a donor roof from a friend so I
pulled bondo, fiberglass, aluminum foil, chicken wire and even a coffee can
out of the PO's repair attempts while cutting the roof off.  The bus is a '61
subhatch westy and deserved to be saved.  I'm working on a whole write up for
my club newsletter (SV2's) and for my website.

Later,
Aaron
