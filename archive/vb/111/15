 well, that's kind of cheating... it still has a vac can on it, so not true
mech-only.

this is the T3 dizzy with the little black socket on the side, right? that
is actually my favorite distributor, but AGAIN, the 2 i have no longer
function properly - vac cans died.

any vendors on the list seeing an opportunity here?

repopping the various vac cans and rebuilt dizzys seems to be in need.
