<<  Im trying to figure out which front trans mount # my 62 SC uses... the

 manuel (thanks to Thom:) calls for 211 301 265A from chassis # 971550, my 
 chassis is 889718, so its a no-go...
  WCM has the 265A, but says 63-67... ok... but then goes on to say that the 
 266 is for 50-67....wtf? If one will fit 50-67, shouldnt it also fit the 
 63-67? 
  Am I missing sumthin.... or is the 266 a "generic" for all splits?

 through May 59 the split case tranny buses use a completely diferent 
nosecone and front mount, so for tunnel case originally there was one from 59 
1/2 through  that vin you mentioned, then another through end 67, but what 
you want depends on the vintage of your nose cone and whether someone 
wallered out the holes already to fit the later mount if it was earlier.    
the earlier nose cones take smaller studs on the mount than the laters.   

so I'd crawl under there and look where the front mount attaches to the nose 
cone and see what size studs you have now.

I only use old OEG ones, as FWIS the new ones break.
