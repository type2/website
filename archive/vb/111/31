Hi list,
Had my rear clutch tube welded last August.  It had broken loose and was =
causing all sorts of problems.

Now, the front has broken loose.  It looks like there is a little tab =
that is attached to the frame which has broken loose in front, but the =
tab part that broke off is about a inch in front of the part that it =
broke off of.  In the rear, there is no curve in my bowden tube.

Can I just push the front of the tube to the rear and weld it back into =
place where it broke loose?  Are there any threads or posts on the =
archive that may help?  I can't even put my bus into reverse without =
grinding.  Any help would be appreciated.

Ed
