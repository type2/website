Subject: Re: [VB] How to tell a NOS round bus mirror???

should shine - maybe needs a little polishing?   Even old used ones I have 
made look nice with some polish

the originals - some had a p/n on the back, some didn't.

the repros made now have something funky with their markings, forget exactly 
what

 all my older original ones are polished aluminum.  I
 found a set that are suposed to be NOS but the finish
 is a brush type finish.  I thought original morrors
 were polished.  anyone know for sure?
 
 Also,  what markings beside the part # should be on
 the ring on the back?
 
 thanks
