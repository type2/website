I posted a pic on www.vintagebus.com and www.thesamba.com/vw to voice my =
opinion of VWOA's heavy-handed corporate bullstuff. Now I have to figure =
out how to do the same in the rear.=20

BTW, VWTrends magazine previews next month's issue with "Exclusive =
Interfiew with VWoA:Logo and Trademark Usage! What it Means to the =
Future of Your VW"

         -Harry in Fresno

p.s. Please don't come to the Madera Spring Fling this Sunday the 28th. =
We want all the vintage swag to ourselves. Locals only!
