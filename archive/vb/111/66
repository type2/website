Subject: mid-atlantic meets?

For those of you in the area or willing to travel,
would there be any interest in organizing a gathering
sometime early this summer? There are more type2's
around this area than people realize (though many are
bays) and too few excuses to get out and meet one
another. It would be nice to have something going on
that's less spectator oriented (like the Manassas show
in August) and more in line with a club scenario. I
was out of the circuit for a year or two but the last
thing I can recall that wasn't a Bug Out/In was a
winter camping expedition at French Creek park in
Pennsylvania that drew a decent crowd considering the
weather, it was about 5 years ago. Whether it be an
organized drive, swap meet, or camping trip, there is
a huge variety of locations and opportunities for VW
comraderie in this part of the East Coast. If you've
got the interest, I've got lots of ideas so feel free
to let me know that or to fill me in on what I may not
know about.
                thanks a bunch,
                        jd wilson III
