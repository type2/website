Subject: Re: [VB] Overheating generally (& Degreed Pulleys)

Interesting post. I have run a Berg pulley in my bus
(1600sp)for more than two years and have never
experienced a problem with overheating, even through
the south west and eastern sierra. My motor is
basically stock with the exception of a few upgrades:
010, Solid rockers/swivel feet adjusters, dual relief
case, doghouse set-up,full flow and a 1 1/2 qt sump. I
also run stock compression. I can't say enough how
vital it is to full flow and dog house your motor, not
to mention having it balanced before it is assembled.
Beside air, oil is the life blood of your engine and
you need to keep both of them in good shape. You will
get more out of a motor if you put a little more in to
the quality end of it. When was the last time you
checked the rubber boots that go over your spark plugs
at the head? How about the rubber "gromets" that plug
the holes on the tin above your muffler where the
heater hose is? Engine seal? These are often
overlooked but are vital to keeping your motor cool.
I would have to agree that the closer you are to stock
the better, bit a little tweaking if done right can
help!
