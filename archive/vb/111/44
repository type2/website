Probably grounds at the tail lights.  Make sure each rear reflector has
its own ground wire to the body, like where the battery ground strap
bolts to the body.  While you're there, take out the tail light bulbs
and make sure the base isn't all crudded up...shine up the contacts
as required.

The 9-prong box should be OK for now.  The blinking action is provided
by mechanical relay contacts in the box, so the voltage out of the box
will either be whatever battery voltage is present at the 9-prong box
or zero.  The circuit that drives the _coil_ of this relay may work
a little differently on 12 V if it is expecting 6 V, but the contacts
will work the same.

I hope this helps!
