Subject: RE: [VB] New VB owner with some first questions

Is there a way to tell for sure if it is IRS transmission? I have never
owned any vehicle this old so everything is new to me. My other two are low
maintenance vehicles and i do small stuff to them but have never pulled an
engine. I am glad i don't have to quite yet for the starter.

thanks,
Glenn
