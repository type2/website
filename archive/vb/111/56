>> correct timing/distributor.  Correct fan speed.  correct or
>> at least reasonable compression ratio (some claim that too

>> case? closed cell foam sealing the doghouse oil cooler?
>> Stock quality heater boxes & muffler.  It goes on...
>>
>> From my experience, a few points worth emphasizing:
>>
>> 1) replacement carbs are not jetted correctly (too lean)
>> for a bus.  Verify the jetting and try to match stock jets
>> (see specs in Bentley).  The air correction (AC) jet is very
>> important here--bigger AC jet means leaner mixture.  I am
>> still trying to find a stock AC jet for a 71 bus--which is
>> what you need for a 1600dp in a bay window.
>>
>> 2) Fan speed:  hand turn your gen/alt pulley w/ a wrench
>> and count the number of revolutions to the gen/alt pulley for
>> one revolution of your crank shaft pulley.  Accd to
>> VeeWee111, the stock ratio is 1 turn of crank pulley to 2.0
>> turns of the gen/alt pulley on a 1600dp.  1:2.1 is better.
>> From memory, the correct ratio is 1:1.9 on a 1600sp.  Any
>> less and your fan speed is too low.  There at lots of
>> potential reasons and VeeWee111 has a lot to say about this.
>> One big factor is the size of the crank pulley--VW made
>> different sizes for different motors but didn't mark the size
>> on the pulley.  Larger crank pulley = faster fan.  Also--do
>> you have the correct fan?  VW made many different fans.
>> VeeWee111 has posted often about this.
>>
>> 3) Degreed pulleys are nice as a concept, but I was unable
>> to find one worth having.  Two issues: 1) weight: Accd to the
>> Gene Berg catalogue, a crank pulley should not be too light
>> or it affects efficiency in a daily driver.  Most all degreed
>> pulleys are lightened (good for drag racing but not daily
>> drivers).  2) fan speed:  Most degreed pulleys are "power
>> pulleys" which means smaller diameter which means slower fan
>> speed (good for drag racing).  Gene Berg's degreed pulley is
>> actually heavier than stock (good for daily driver) and
>> "stock" size for an older sp motor.  Nonetheless, it is too
>> small for a 1600 in a bus.  See my  post on this at:
>> http://www.type2.com/archive/type2/057252.html
>> Best option that I found was to verify the TDC mark on a
>> stock pulley and add my own degree marks.  There are various
>> ways to do this.
>>
>> 4) To set max advanced on a distributor w/ *both*
>> mechanical and vacuum advance (e.g. stock dist. for 1600dp),
>> disconnect the vacuum advance (and retard if present), set
>> the timing w/ a timing light so that you have the desired max
>> advance (e.g. 30 deg. BTDC at 3000 RPM), then re connect the
>> vacuum advance.  This works b/c under load, the vacuum
>> advance mechanism does not come into play above appx. 1/2
>> wide open throttle (WOT).  Thus, at 3000 RPM under load, the
>> carb will be + 1/2 WOT and vacuum advance doesn't have much
>> impact on timing.  In contrast, if you pull the throttle open
>> by hand to increase RPMs while the car is out of gear, the
>> carb will be at less than 1/2 WOT, vacuum advance will come
>> into play, and total advance at 3000 RPM will be higher.  On
>> a vacuum advance *only* distributor (e.g. stock dist. for
>> 1600sp), this does not apply.

>> My general advice:  If you have an overheating problem,
>> return everything to stock.  everything.  tweak it until the
>> overheating problem is resolved.  [Personally, I feel that
>> oil temps over 225 in the sump are a problem.  Where you

>> stock compression.....  Once you solve the overheating
>> problem, if you still have any energy and want improvements,
>> change one thing at a time so you can evaluate the effect.
>> Mods that I like include Type IV oil cooler properly
>> installed, full flow oil filter (which I don't have), and
>> alternator (w/ correct alternator belt (different from gen
>> belt!) and backing plates)  I can't claim to have always

>> lines.  and your seat belts are in good condition.
