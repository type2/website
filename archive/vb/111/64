Subject: re:writing in headlight bucket

when i was replacing the seals on my headlight about a year and a half ag=
o-i
noticed writing on the passenger side headlight area. didn't look too
closely-i assumed maybe it was the painter signing his work or something.=
 on
mine the writing is somehow in the paint....not on a piece of paper stuck=
 in
the bucket..
