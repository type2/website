  Cam lift and duration, compression ratio, cam timing, carburetion, exhaust
all play a role in the vacuum of an engine. We did a non scientific test on
a SVDA dizzy in different engines (sizes and compression ratios, different
cams) and got different results from each engine using the same dizzy. Just
like a big V8 more cam less vacuum. and the pulses change with rpm's and
loads. In my wife's 65 Bug with a NEW Mexi engine in which I installed a
Engle 100 cam with a factory SVDA I noticed a difference in how it ran
before and after the cam change. Same engine. same dizzy, different cam. It
seems to take a little longer for the vacuum advance to kick in, but I got a
substantial increase in gas mileage with the 100 cam verses the stock cam.
In all of my buses I use the ever hated 009, I have tried 010, 050, 019 (no
SVDA or DvDA dizzys, waiting for John to figure out where to pull pulsed
vacuum from on Kaduds) and have had great luck, buses seem to run cool, I
cruise at 3600-3800 rpm's, can pull the dipstick after 100 mile 75 mph runs
and haven't hurt an engine yet, and it's hotter then h#ll here.

ronnie   just my observation.

ps. Just finished building another type 1 1800, going on the DYNO next week
(Geoff Harts) when he gets back from his honeymoon. Going to be interesting
to se what HP and torque these put out (it's the same as in my DD)

pps. Geoff Hart is coming over to my shop in a couple weeks to teach me how
to run my dyno.

SVDA works best with a 34PICT-3 which it was set up for. I have not noticed
any difference in running with a stock good 34PICT and one that I have
jetted. The vacuum seems to remain constant for both carbs.

As for indexing, you are referring to confirmation of tdc by physical
means, I imagine? Onld dowel in the no 1?>
Any resource to what is required vac signal for each dizzy/carb?
Any specs available to check out an old dizzy with, at the shaft
primarily? I have a 205 from a 69 bus, with a working vac can (if you
apply vac, it moves), and appears to be solid, but I don't know how to
tell if it's worn too much, they all seem floppy at the drive interface,
so I assume there is a clearance between the shims/washers at the end of
the shafts?
What carbs/vac signals are the SVDAs best for considering the above
statement.

Here are a couple tips that are often not followed.

1) proper ignition timing depends on the distributor used, NOT ON THE
ENGINE.

2) The distributor must match the carb(s) for the proper vacuum signal.
It's different from 71' and newer compared to 70' and earlier.

3) be CAREFUL on "trusting" the timing marks on pulleys. Pulleys have
often been switched around, and the timing notches in the pulleys are in
different places for different years. Index it to be sure. This includes
aluminum pulleys, which are often indexed improperly!
