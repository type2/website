 Can anyone tell me how to tell a *correct* pulley for an h-case motor?...
 June 22, 1967 vintage to be exact  Also, would anyone have a picture they
 could email me of a *correct* motor?
 
 TIA

I'd look at brochures.  make sure the pic has the pre heat hose running 
forward to the heater box- if it runs down to a pick up pipe through the rear 
tin it is early 66 or earlier.   

whos going to assemble an on line gallery of vintage original engine pics?  
dated?  please?
