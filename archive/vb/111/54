Subject: RE: [VB] New VB owner with some first questions


Thanks everyone for your help. I decided to brave it and try to see what I
really had going on. Much to my surprise the actual harness looks very new.
It is just from the harness to all the light and accessories that was held
together with electrical tape and wire the changed gauges every 6". I ripped
out everything from the fuse box and all the crappy wiring and am left with
a very clean harness protruding. I also tried to remove the starter. I got
the bottom bolt but the top one looks 2 sides of a square and the other two
sides round ed off to make a half circle/half square.

Is this the bolt and you remove the nut from the engine side(rear of the
bus) of the starter? Or is this a DPO because he didn't have the nut? Do i
have to remove the engine to remove the starter?

How do i read the wire gauge in the wiring diagram? is it mm diameter?

How do i find out what the fuse amps are?

Are the black bars across fuse 3 & 4, and across 5 & 6 jumpers? DPO used
fuse box from a bay van so i want to make sure i have all the jumpers.

Thanks again for all the help. Unlike every other VW i have owned every time
i dig into this bus i find more new parts. New CV's, brakes, brake lines.
Some one spent alot of money to get it fixed up and then just gave up/ran
out of money. Hopefully i will have it out and about before the end of the
summer.

peace,
