Wow, the ultra-rare headless man!!!

>I posted a pic on www.vintagebus.com and www.thesamba.com/vw to voice my
opinion of VWOA's heavy-handed corporate bullstuff. Now I have to figure out
how to do the same in the rear.

BTW, VWTrends magazine previews next month's issue with "Exclusive Interfiew
with VWoA:Logo and Trademark Usage! What it Means to the Future of Your VW"

p.s. Please don't come to the Madera Spring Fling this Sunday the 28th. We
want all the vintage swag to ourselves. Locals only!
