WCM number 211-810. This is the same stuff that they sell for the wing-vent
to glass seal. Retail $7.59

Subject: [VB] Fresh air duct rubber replacement


Hi all,

I'm trying to find one of the rubber seals in the fresh air duct.  If
you are sitting in the drivers seat there is a knob in the center of the
fresh air duct that vents the air to the driver and passenger area or to
the back of the bus.  I've looked through WCM catalog and have yet to
find the part number.  Does anybody know the part number to order?  I'm
holding off putting the roof on my bus to replace this piece and can't
find it.

Thanks,
Aaron
