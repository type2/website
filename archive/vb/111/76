Subject: Off-topic Question

The brake booster needs replaced on my son's Ch*vy L*mina.  Since he is
severely economically challenged (poor college student), he wants to do it
himself and save some money.  If you have ever done this, please p-mail me.

To have the required bus content, he will be using my tools (used
extensively on the '67) to do the job.
Thanks in advance!!
