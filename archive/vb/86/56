All those nice federal laws about disputing credit-card charges don't
apply to PayPal.  Read their fine print - they are just a payment escrow
service.  You can complain to PayPal but it may not do any good.

This shouldn't be a problem when dealing with reputable suppliers, but
most reputable suppliers should have a secure online credit card form
anyway.

All IMHO.
