All this off topic talk - I almost forgot it was Friday! ;-)

Many people want a USPS Money Order. There is no recourse if you send a 
USPS money order and the person you are buying a part from doesn't send 
the part. Same goes with Western Union (BidPay). I don't see any 
difference in any of these services, and I would consider USPS 
reputable. I use PayPal - and the only annoying thing to me is their fee.
