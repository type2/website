  The cost to the vendor are a lot higher then taking CC. Which in turn will
cost the consumer more. The cancel policy sucks and can hurt the vendor in
the long run. It cost the consumer and the vendor money. Pay Pal is a great
money maker for the owner but not for the users in my opinion. 
  I have considered different forms of payment and will stick to accepting
CC. 
  I still do not take the numbers on line, mainly for security issues and
perfer to call the customer myself to verify the order and get the CC info.
This way you know exactly what your getting from me and WHEN, I have very
few returns due to wrong parts and it assist the customer in getting what
they need and expect.
