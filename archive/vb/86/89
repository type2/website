Hi karl, i'm interested in how you got your gas gauge working again. I think 
my sender unit in the tank is messed up. here is what it is doing. When i 
fill the tank up all the way it registers half (most of the time) and slowy 
goes down as i drive it until it hits empty. then i usually fill it up just 
to be safe and it only takes half fuel.  So basically it never registers 
more than half.
Any help would be great.
thanks
john.
