There's a guy up Canada that was selling used LS diffs for ~$750.  He pulled
them from Safaris (Things) down in Mexican junkyards.  Genuine German LS
diffs too.  I think he had both swing and IRS types.  No idea if he has them
anymore.

Hi Ronnie,
Yes there was!  For $200.00 you buy an imported military Thing core tranny,
but with no guarantee of usable parts inside from some fellow in the SW of
USA (Arizona?) area.  Back in the mid 80s you could buy a limited slip
differental from the VW dealer for about $2,000.00.   Eric&Barb
