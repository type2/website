Subject: Re: [VB] carb matchup and stuff

For about 2 years I kept a 28 pict carb as a spare in my bug.  I actually
think it ended up on the car more than being a spare because I kept having
nothing but problems with my Brazilian 30pict.  I had a stock 1600cc DUAL
PORT engine that I ran this carb on for many, many miles.  It ran smooth,
idled better than any other carb, but I did notice that it seemed to strain
a little above 70mph (like that would matter, heh).  I don't think you'll
have much of a problem running it personally.

Later
Charles
