Hi Ronnie,
Yes there was!  For $200.00 you buy an imported military Thing core tranny, 
but with no guarantee of usable parts inside from some fellow in the SW of 
USA (Arizona?) area.  Back in the mid 80s you could buy a limited slip 
differental from the VW dealer for about $2,000.00.   Eric&Barb
