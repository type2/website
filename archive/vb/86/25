Actually, I learned a bit of tranny trivia today from Rick Long at Long
Enterprises. The third and forth gears in a bus trans has a groove machined
into the edge of each tooth running perpendicular to the length of the
tooth. These were the only pre-IRS gears made with a groove.

You can see third gear by taking the drain plug out of the bottom gear case.
With the plug out, look or feel inside the plug hole for the groove. If
you've got the groove, its a bus third (and most likely a bus forth). No
groove and its a bug third ( and most likely a forth).
