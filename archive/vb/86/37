  Hi everybody. I have finally gotten the finished artwork back from the printer for the Everybus 2002 shirts. It's up on the www.teamspatula.com t-shirt page. Don't forget that Everybus 2001 shirts sold out in like 15 minutes, so make sure to get your order in early this year! 
  So, without further ado, I shall give the details for pre-ordering shirts. At this time, I will be printing four (4) separate designs which you may choose from, all viewable on the t-shirt page:
1. Everybus 2002 shirts
2. Vintagebus/type2 official Netvergnugen list shirts
3. Air Cooled Search & Rescue Team red on grey
4. Air Cooled Search & Rescue Team white on navy

  I will be accepting orders until March 28th. Please get them in as soon as possible. I will be taking the final count to the printers on the 29th in order to insure that I will have everything ready for Everybus.
  Sizes are available in child's Medium up through adult XXXL (although XXL and XXXL cost more)
  All designs cost $15.00 each. Long sleeved shirts are available for any design for $20.00. XXL shirts also cost $20.00, and XXXL cost $22.00
Shipping is $5.00 PER SHIRT. (obviously, if you are planning to come to Everybus, there is no shipping charge for pick-up at the event).
  
  Please mail a check or money order to:

Please also enclose an index card with your
