Right.  FWIW, I don't think (and I *will* be corrected if I'm wrong on this)
there was a different center section for a bus.  I think they were 113
center sections, with just the R&P flipped and a different nose cone.

Go to http://vintagebus.com/docs/5867part/223.png and you'll see the case has
a 113 part #
