Id like to start out by thanking Karl for the sending unit he gave me!
It sure helped a lot. Using that sender I was able to get my gas gauge
working but it's a 6v gauge and I really don't like using the voltage
drop units. Does anyone know a place to get a new or used 12v gauge that
works with a stock sender? I have seen some new ones for sale but they
require a VDO sender that doesn't look stock to me. Any suggestions?
Thanks!
TJ
