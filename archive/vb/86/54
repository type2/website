Subject: Re: [VB] california import and Paypal

I'd be wary of C*l Imp*rts. They are one of the few remaining suppliers of
T3 parts out there and I've had to order a lot of stuff from them for my '71
squareback. There has "never", "never" been a case when I've returned a part
that I didn't have to dispute the charge on my CC to get a credit issued to
my card.

The last time I returned something, they didn't credit my card and even
after I disputed the charge, they challenged my dispute with the bank. I had
to send the bank a copy of my UPS return receipt to prove that I did send
the part back.

Does PayPal have a method to get your money back in case you have a problem
with the vendor? If so, how difficult is the process?
