  If the price was right, you should buy it anyway. With the scaricty of RBB
parts and bus axles and other assorted pieces it would be good to have JUST
IN CASE.

I've got a line on a used big stub transaxle with redux boxes and
everything.

Is there anyway to tell, from the casting numbers or some other method if
the gearbox is actually from a bus instead of a bug?

Reason I ask is that I want to get the used transaxle to have a bus forth
and ring and pinion. I have a rebuilt gearbox but, it has bug gears and ring
and pinion.
