Hello List,
Getting ready to rebuild the Solex carb on the 1600 sp that's in my 67 =
sundial.

I have Brosol carbs on both of my bugs, both w/ 1600's, and I'm unhappy =
with one of them.  I've heard good and bad things about Brosols, so I =
thought I would rebuild my original Solex.  I've learned the hard way, =
(and the expensive way too) about non-German parts, especially =
mechanical parts.

That brings about this question though.  Are all of the rebuild kits out =
on the market Mexican/Brazilian?  Does anyone make a German rebuild kit? =
 It seems useless to rebuild a carb with a kit made by someone who =
doesn't do a good job of making the part you are trying to stay away =
from.

TIA,
Ed Richardson
