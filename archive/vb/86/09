Last night it wouldn't start, so I jumpered a wire from the starter 
solenoid to the back and touched it to the positive post in the home 
depot parking lot (someone on the list suggested this- the wire, not the 
parking lot).  it started immediately. Now I know what at least ONE of 
the problems is.  Also the ground strap to the tranny is shot.  I'm 
going to go through everything to put it back right.

Thanks to everyone who helped!!
