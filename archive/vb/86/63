Subject: Volkswagen Key Service Manual, copies available

Hi all,

	This is my last posting of this here on the list before I go
thesam-ballistic....

	I also have some pix of contents up here....
http://www.sv2s.com/users/67busses/MISC4SALE/keybook.htm

	Awhile back I got a bit overzealous and made some copies of the Original VW
dealer Key Service book.  For some reason, I made waaay too many.  So I'm
offering them up for sale cheap.

	I wanted to offer it up to the list first, before I put a public ad up
somewhere.

	There are a lot of numbers and codes and a some pictures of how to make the
key.  This is a good reference for Key Profiles and a good table on which
year and type cars used which key types.  It's good for all Volkswagens (not
only just Busses) and it's in five languages, German, English, French,
Italian, and Spanish!

	The price $25 inlcuding shipping anywhere in the US. They are unbound, so
you will need stick it in a big 3 ring binder or goto Kinkos to have it
bound.  I am also open to trades...

	Please contact me if you are interested.

THANKS!

PS. With all this talk about theft and car security, I took into careful
consideration the impact that this info might have.  After thinking about
it, I realized that this Key Book isn't a guide to how to break into
someones car, it's a guide to how to make a key based off the original key
code of a lock.  Not only are a lot of locks changed from the original key
codes, but if a thief wanted to try and make a key, they would need the
stamped number from the original key (then why don't they just take the car
then) or the lock itself (in which case they are in the car, already).

PPS.  I'm paypal enabled, so you can pay me via Credit Card, too!
