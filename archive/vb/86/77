Ok, so, since at least noon this morning EST everything should be fine.
(i wasnt able to get to check on things till then..the webserver software
didnt restart..)

anyway. thats that. some bits of the internet may still have DNS
resolution issues that will slowly work themselves out.

thanks...david
