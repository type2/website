Subject: Red Barn / KelleyPark FYI

Hey all of you planning to be in California in April!!!

	Just wanted to throw out a reminder about the BYOB (Bring your own Bus) Bus
Show at The Red Barn, Saturday, April 6th!

	See details at http://www.redshift.com/~taylorvw/svt/

	SEE YOU THERE!


	Also, I got some recent details about Kelley Park the following Sunday,
April 7th.  Based of the current situation, it looks like it's going to be
very packed again this year.   A new rule for the park, this year, NO CARS
ON THE GRASS!  This was mandated by Kelley Park, not by the Golden Gate
chapter.  ULP!  That means it will be similar to what was seen last year on
the 'rain/wet grass' plan.  Also, The lower parking lot will NOT be used for
the swap.  This was mandated by the City of San Jose, not by the Golden Gate
chapter.  Another, smaller area in the park is planned to be used along with
some of the (former) car show space.  They are working on both of these
issues and plans may change in a moments notice...hopefully for the better.
My suggestion is to get there early!
