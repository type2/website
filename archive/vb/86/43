In my opinion, this way is really a nice way to buy stuff online, instead of
giving our credit card #!<<

Of course you can use the "Shop Anywhere" feature on the PayPal website and use your PayPal balance to buy stuff from ANY online supplier.  I have bought from Bus Depot, RMMW, and The Parts Bin with this method and I love it!  They give you a "virtual" credit card number that deducts from your Paypal account.  That way, there is no risk of fraud with your personal cards and more importantly, your wife\husband won't be able to read your credit card statement and see all the money you spent on VW parts!!!
