No, actually you can take a bug center section, reverse the R&P, and stick
the bus axle tubes on it and run it in a bus. Rebuilt center sections that
are "supposedly" for a bus are sometimes sold this way.

I already know that the used trans came out of a bus. What I don't know is
whether it has a bus center section or a bug center section with a reversed
R&P.
