I think this came up a month or so ago. That guy owns Yakima and it's
his bus...

I just went to my local REI store to spend my yearly
refund, and spotted the new Yakima catalog with a
split bus on the cover!  They make top racks for
hauling bikes and other stuff.

I scanned the covers of the catalog, for anyone who
wants to see it, but doesn't feel like driving to your
local REI store.

Is this a listee's bus?  And who's the guy on the
back?
