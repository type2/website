Hi,

Here's the response I received from the seller.

Thanks,

Hi my friend, Sorry, but which is the Part, that you
this speaking (Slinding Windows). If it is the Slinding
Windows, normally, had been sold, some Pairs, for until
U$150, but this Pair, only reached U$63, the cost of
each Pair of Slinding Windows, here in Brazil, is U$80,
but, I goes to honor, the value of the Bid, that given
in the Ebay (U$63). In briefing, I will be placing
another Pair of Slinding Windows, in my Auctions in the
Ebay.
Thanks
your Brazilian friend
Agnaldo
