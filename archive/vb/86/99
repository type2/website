No problem, glad you asked, pretty simple on the 6-12V conversion, I just
take the ground wire (black) from one blower and hook it to the power (red)
wire of the other blower.  Two 6V blowers in series is 12V!!  Pretty cool,
can't do that on an Eberspacher because they only have 1 blower for both the
combustion and heated air (which also make the cfm of the heated air much
lower in an Eberspacer)
