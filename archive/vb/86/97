Subject: value needed on tranny tools that are for sale

Hi all,
It's been a long time since I posted but I kinda need some help in placing a 
value on a few swingaxle tranny tools I'm selling.

What I have is:
VW 296 - this pushes the transmission assy. out of the case.
VW 294 - gear shift test appliance (allows proper adj. of selector forks)
VW ? - tool that attaches to hockey stick to chage gears when adj. selector 
forks (used in conjunction with VW 294 above)
-extra input shaft
-extra differential
-extra swing axle tranny case
-extra nosecone

These items are all for sale and I would appreciate the help from anyone who 
knows the correct value for these parts.


Thanks in advance,
Dave Barnes

Is anyone from the Bay Area going to the show next weekend at 
VolksAuthority's shop in San Jose?
