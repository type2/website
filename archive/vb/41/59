Subject: Gas leaking INTO carburator

Hi Listee's

With the engine not running, my H30/31 pict carb is very slowly 
leaking gas from the mixing tube into the venturi. It then puddles on 
the butterfly and leaks out through the butterfly shaft/body 
clearance. It also oozes through the spacer that separates the carb 
from the manifold. Is there suppose to be a check ball in the fuel 
path for the mixing tube? Could a leaky float needle valve cause this 
through a siphon action? The carb work fine otherwise. Any ideas?

Thanks
