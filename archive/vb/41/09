Jim, 

    Some folks live in their bus, others of us consider them (or sports or 
whatever) to be a hobby.  How does the condition of your forehead depend on a 
stupid baseball game?  Yeah, I am a diehard Diamondbacks fan too.  I am also 
a diehard bus fan, but my DC and I are taking a year or so apart from one 
another to make sure my forehead, or anything else, is not adversely affected 
by it.  Put the hammers down, turn around and walk away.  Find some beer and 
have a hangover at work tomorrow.  At least that's not permanent. ;)

Jon
