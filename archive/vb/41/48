Subject: Speaking of steering problems...

Ever since I got my '66, it has steered weirdly. It tends to drift around a bit and then when you go to turn, the is a spot where the wheel turns kinda hard right before the bus turns.  I replaced dampener which helped slightly but I never really got under there to look too closely because I didn't feel it was that much of a problem.  Since Winter is upon here in Ohio, I am going to try to get to all these things I put off over the summer. To make a long story longer, I ahve the symptons (according to Muir) of worn bushings in the swing lever arm. Finally, here's my questions, Can you replace these bushings without removing the whole bloody assembly, beam and all?  And also, does anyone sell JUST the bushings? I see a repair kit in motorworks catalog for about $35 bucks, but I just need the bushings (I think).
