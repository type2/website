Doc Ric writ:
"One listee recommended I call a machine shop/ engine builder in Asheville
NC to see what CR he suggests for mountain driving." 

I would recommend calling Jake Raby.  Normally I do not recommend anyone,
but after seeing some of his custom work it is incredible.  He designs his
motors specifically for the owners needs and type of car/bus.  I am sure he
can set up a correct CC for you.

Normally I can do just about everything engine wise myself, but if I needed
help with something custom I would call this guy first.  If you know me,
this is a big compliment.

Personally, I think 6.9cr is too low.  I always shoot for 7.5cr.  CR makes
your power, if it is too low it is less efficient than it needs to be.  I
advise putting in an oil temp gauge, time it at 30 degrees max, and if you
hear pinging downshift because the engine is lugging (under 1500RPM).  I
drive occasionally in the North GA mountains and it runs cooler lugging
mountains than cruising at 60MPH on the interstate.... I used to believe it
would run hot in the mountains, instead I was being slowed down by a pesky
wazerboxer-Vanagon ;)  RGBs kick butt!
