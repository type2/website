Subject: 65 wont take gas..solved!

at the advise of a freind, i got a new filter, that has white filter paper 
instead of yellow. i ran the tank to almost dry and took apart the 
filter...and sure enough, it was FILTHY. anyone know a good gastank cleaner? 
is it easier to just get a new aluminium one?
