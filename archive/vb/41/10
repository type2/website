Subject: Repro Long Spoon Latch Inners

Greetings All,

I have recently repooped (err repopped) some long
spoon latch inners.  Largely driven out of frustration at
buying these latches and then finding the inners on at least 50%
were cracked really making them useless in terms of pulling
them apart, rechroming and restoring.

So by applying a little digitisation technology I have produced
repops from quality pewter (stronger than pot metal and they will
never corrode and lose their chrome....).

I can probably pull about 600 to 700 from the mould I have made
so if you want some send me an email.....they'd be reasonably cheap
although I have to cover chroming and stuff......

I have put some pics at 

http://users.pipeline.com.au/hoopty/spinner.htm

One is a rechromed orig and one is a repro....pick which is which?

Having mastered the technology for reproing small pot metal pieces I could
also produce short inners and the triangular three hole cleats if anyone
is interested......

Night All!
