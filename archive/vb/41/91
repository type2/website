Hi Gordon,
The phenolic washer is for retaining the screw that fastens the running bulb 
holder.  So when you remove the running light bulb holder from the headlight 
assembly you do not drop the screw into the dirt/grass and loose it.  The 
main large screw to mount the headlight assembly into the bucket has a 
plastic slaeeve to do the same function.    Eric&Barb
