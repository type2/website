All indicator bulbs EXCEPT the high beam indicator have constant power with key in run position.They recieve this through the outer portion of the bulb holder,the circut is compleated through the wire running to the approiate sending unit that grounds to turn the indicator lamp on.You will see these bulb holders fit into an isolator(plastic mount one upper and one lower) on the back of the speedo that will have a spade terminal on it this is where the hot wire from terminal 15 on the ignition switch goes then it feeds the positive terminal on the fuel gauge.The sender wires then go on the spade terminal on the approiate indicator bulb holder.I hope this is clear enough for you.

I'm looking at the wiring diagram for my '65, and seeing 4 wires at this
bulb.  I've got the four connections coming to/ from it, but I'm not sure
what goes where.  I assume Blue/green from sender goes strait into bulb, but
where do ignition, and jumpers to gen, and blinkers go?  Any help
appreciated...
