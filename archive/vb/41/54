There should be a tight spot, and that should be right where the center of
the box is, but not eccessively tight, just different. If your drag link is
not adjusted right, and you have a spot where the pitman arm and drag link
can become nearly paralell, this can cuase dangerous binding. You should try
to be certain you have equal travel of sterring in both directions,
regardless of the tire positions right now, and then correct the drag link
to center the swing arm assembly, and finally the drivers side (or both if
both are adjustable) tie rods to insure correct geometry.
Otherwise bushings, pitman arm, drag link, and rod ends must be all secure
and not wasted, but please check the pitman to drag link so that you never
have a lock up.
It took a while with Mr Bently to fix my screwy bus, turned right more than
lefgt, since tires were set straight with the box 1 turn out of center! This
can also damage the steering box if run very long...

Ever since I got my '66, it has steered weirdly. It tends to drift around a
bit and then when you go to turn, the is a spot where the wheel turns kinda
hard right before the bus turns.  I replaced dampener which helped slightly
but I never really got under there to look too closely because I didn't feel
it was that much of a problem.  Since Winter is upon here in Ohio, I am
going to try to get to all these things I put off over the summer. To make a
long story longer, I ahve the symptons (according to Muir) of worn bushings
in the swing lever arm. Finally, here's my questions, Can you replace these
bushings without removing the whole bloody assembly, beam and all?  And
also, does anyone sell JUST the bushings? I see a repair kit in motorworks
catalog for about $35 bucks, but I just need the bushings (I think).
