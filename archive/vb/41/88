Hi AL,
The brass bushings were original to the pre-1968 VWs and alot better than the 
later/aftermarket thin potmetal/plastic ones.  The coiled ended spring clips 
work much better than the U-shaped ones.  The best and easiest safety wire 
you can get for this and those shifter linkage square headed bolts is wire 
used for tying steel reinforcement rods in concrete pouring and can be found 
at most any hardware store!
