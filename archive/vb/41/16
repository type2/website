Subject: Re: Compression ratios on SP engine  MORE Check my figures

Thanks for the replies. One listee recommended I call a machine shop/ engine
builder in Asheville NC to see what CR he suggests for mountain driving.

His comments were that he would set up the engine with a 6.9 CR using dished
pistons and machine work to the heads to increase the combustion chamber
volume. He said that shimming / spacing to the .070 that I need to reach
this CR would throw the rocker geometry off too much.

My pistons are flat, so if my figures are correct, I would have to remove
around 10cc from each head chamber to build the engine without any shims.

This seems like a lot of material to remove. Any input on removing this much
material? What shim height do you guys think is excessive? Looks like I need
.070 inches on 1 and 2 and .080 inches on 3 and 4.

Shims available  are 0.010, 0.020, 0.030, 0.040, 0.060, 0.090 inches.
Stacking shims will work but seems like a sloppy thing to do?

Any input appreciated in advance!
