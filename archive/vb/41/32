Subject: RE: [VB] Torque hub king nut to 650 ft-lbs+++ ??

I bought one of those gear torque multipliers things you see in the mags...
I had to get some 12 to 14mm studs to mount it to my drums and then place a
few washers in-between so it wouldn't hit the splines on the drum... Then
due to the washers, the gear didn't fully engage...  In the end, the nuts
came right off with it...
