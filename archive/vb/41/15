I thought that the "U" shaped clips went out in the '60s!  The one-loop
coil spring clips are more secure, and they also provide a hole to run a
piece of safety wire through to positively secure the clips.  Having gone
into more than one clutch simply because a clip popped off, I recommend
that you run a piece of safety wire around the groove in the throwout
bearing and through the holes in the clips.
