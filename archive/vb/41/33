I use a 46mm 1/2 socket from snap on with a 24 flex bar, and a 6 foot steel
pipe on it. Makes enough to break it free, and I used a jack on the bar end
in depseration once now, worked well.

I bought one of those gear torque multipliers things you see in the mags...
I had to get some 12 to 14mm studs to mount it to my drums and then place a
few washers in-between so it wouldn't hit the splines on the drum... Then
due to the washers, the gear didn't fully engage...  In the end, the nuts
came right off with it...
