The socket should be a little metal tube with a push-on terminal on
one end.  As you stated, the blue/green stripe wire from the sender
goes to the push-on terminal.  Usually there is a metal clip on the
speedometer that the socket slides into, which makes contact with
the metal tube of the socket.  The other connections will be on this
metal clip.

If you have a Bentley manual, look at page E-14 1.  That little U
shaped piece of metal at the bottom of the speedometer is what I'm
talking about.  That piece of metal is the "jumper" between the
oil and the generator bulbs.  It would have just two wires connected
it: one from the ignition and the other to the turn signal indicator
bulb.

I hope this helps!
