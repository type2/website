helped slightly but I never really got under there to look too closely
because I didn't feel it was that much of a problem.  Since Winter is
upon here in Ohio, I am going to try to get to all these things I put off
over the summer. To make a long story longer, I ahve the symptons
(according to Muir) of worn bushings in the swing lever arm. Finally,
here's my questions, Can you replace these bushings without removing the
whole bloody assembly, beam and all?  And also, does anyone sell JUST the
bushings? I see a repair kit in motorworks catalog for about $35 bucks,
but I just need the bushings (I think).

On a split, you have to press out the bushings, press in new bushings, and
then ream them to size.  On Bays, you skip the reaming step.

It can be done with the beam in place.  I made a bushing puller out of PVC
pipe, fender washer, and all-thread.  It simply pulls both bushings out of
the bottom of the beam.  No hammering required.

The stiff spot in the steering sounds like a steering box problem.
Steering boxes can be pretty nasti.  If the worm or pin are damaged, only
replacement will fix it, as they don't heal by themselves.
