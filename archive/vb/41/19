Subject: Oil light bulb wiring

I'm looking at the wiring diagram for my '65, and seeing 4 wires at this
bulb.  I've got the four connections coming to/ from it, but I'm not sure
what goes where.  I assume Blue/green from sender goes strait into bulb, but
where do ignition, and jumpers to gen, and blinkers go?  Any help
appreciated...
