Subject: Tool question...

Sorting VW parts and organizing tools while watching U.S. Baseball's World
Series Game Four.

Question:
1.> I'm confused. What type/size of hammer do I use to my forehead following
9th/10th innings? 
2.> Do I use the 10 lb. sledge or do I take friend's advice to lighten up and
just use the 5oz. jeweler's ball-peen.
3.> Is it Friday yet?
