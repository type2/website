Are you sure this is not your shift linkage shaft rod?  It runs over the stering parts and from the bottom may look like it connects there...

i was looking under my '67 bus today to see if i could see what was causing 
my steering problem when i saw something abnormal. there is a rod that runs 
over top of the tie rod ends from the steering box-all the way to the 
engine-what is this tube called? i am slowly getting more familiar with bus 
anatomy but could use some help. any way that tube is loose and resting on 
the bolts of the swing arm/tie rods- and not letting me steer normally-
is this a major problem? would it alone cause my steering to be very loose 
and creaks and pops when i steer? any professional diagnosis out there? 
thanks for you help.
