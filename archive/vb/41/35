Subject: Parking Light Minutia


I've been doing some work on the wiring to the headlights on my '58 SC  -
original 6 volt system - and have a question for the electrical gurus on
the list.  The parking light bulb holder, (inside the headlight bucket) on
one headlight,  has a fiber washer that fits on the screw that holds the
parking light bulb housing to the main headlight housing.  In other words,
this fiber washer would appear keep the parking light bulb holder from
grounding to the headlight housing.  But... the parking light holder does
touch the headlight housing on the other side of the PL holder.  And.. only
one of the headlights is like this... the other one has no fiber washer on
the PL holder screw.  So, is there any significance to the fiber washer, or
did one just get added by a PO at some point?  Or should both headlights
have this fiber washer on the PL holder screw?

Thanks for the advise.
