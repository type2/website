Hi Raymond,
Definitely do not use that mechanic again!  Do the work yourself and have a 
safer bus that you can fix out on long trips.  Unless you are planning on 
marrying and retraining your poorly trained mechanic.  Too much torque will 
cause cracking of the metal parts and too little, too uneven torque will 
loosen up by itself!  Also install a dual MC so you can have about half of 
the brakes still working!
