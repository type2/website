I don't recall anything like this when I looked at the lights on
my '64, but I could be remembering wrong.  The gray/black stripe
wire should only go to the center contact of the parking light bulb
and be insulated from everything else, but the bulb also needs a
ground to work.

What I remember about mine is that the parking light holder grounded
through its screws, but it also had a terminal for a ground wire.
I added a ground wire from that terminal to the sheetmetal screw in
the skin of the Bus that already had the heavy ground wire from the
sealed beam.

In general, anything you can do to improve the grounding of the
lighting system will help.  If the fiber washer was not added to
solve some kind of spacing problem, then leaving it out probably
won't hurt and may actually help.

You might want to look at page 581 of the '58-'67 parts manual
at http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5867part.html .  It doesn't
seem to list a fiber washer in the headlamp parts.

I hope this helps!
