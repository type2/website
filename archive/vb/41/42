Torqueing is easy.  You take the torque spec, divide it by your weight,
multiply the result by 12 and measure that distance along the breaker bar.
Put the breaker bar on the nut with the handle horizontal and stand on the
mark without bouncing.  The nut is not torqued, although you will probably
have to tighten it a bit more to insert the cotter pin.  remember that
there are two holes for the cotter pin, so you shouldn't have to tighten
it much to make one of them line up.
