Subject: Re: [VB] Gas leaking INTO carburator

Hi Rocky,
Your fuel pump could be just producing too much pressure due to a defect or 
the push rod for it is set too high causing too much pressure output.  Your 
resevoir shut off valve in the carb could be bad or even the float it rides 
on is leaky or too heavy (BTDT).
