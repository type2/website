Subject: Re: [VB] Compression ratios on SP engine + clutch disc question

Eric and Barb,

Thanks for the information.
This is the problem. In order to shim this thing to 7.1:1 CR it will need
.070 shims on both sides. I fear that this will "shim out" the heads so much
that the stock exhaust and single port manifold will not fit. There is also
the question about throwing off the proper rocker geometry with this amount
of spacing, and quite frankly, that stuff is beyond my understanding.

With all stock new parts, I can not figure out why I am having so much
trouble.

These numbers disturb me:
Measured deck height:
#1  .053 inches
#2  .059
#3  .047
#4  .047

Why the variance in 1 and 2 and different from 3 and 4?

These are new VW heads.
1 48.3cc
2 48.33cc
3 48.73cc
4 48.75cc

I plan to measure everything again tomorrow.

Any input appreciated!

Thanks!

 <<Hi Ric,
Definitely rework the head chambers or get matching new heads and still work
them so they are exactly the same volume and shim under the cylinders only.
We have been having good results with 7.1:1 CR in our bus>>
