John-
I did the swing lever bushing procedure to my bus not long ago. While
I bet it can be done with beam still on the bus, I imagine it would be
a big knuckle scraping head bashing endeavor. The beam comes off so
easy, and it is a good opportunity to clean it up, maybe paint it,
check out those grease fittings.
Buy the kit, it is worth having a shiny new pin to swivel smoothly in
your new bushings, new grease seal to keep dirt out of your new parts.
The kit is readily available, the reamer is not. At least I had a hard
time tracking one down, in the end I went to Wolfgang Int'l with the
beam and they reamed it for $20. Well worth it to me, there was a
dramatic improvement in steering once I got everything put back
together.
Good luck,
Joel

Ever since I got my '66, it has steered weirdly. It tends to drift
around a bit and then when you go to turn, the is a spot where the
wheel turns kinda hard right before the bus turns.  I replaced
dampener which helped slightly but I never really got under there to
look too closely because I didn't feel it was that much of a problem.
Since Winter is upon here in Ohio, I am going to try to get to all
these things I put off over the summer. To make a long story longer, I
ahve the symptons (according to Muir) of worn bushings in the swing
lever arm. Finally, here's my questions, Can you replace these
bushings without removing the whole bloody assembly, beam and all?
And also, does anyone sell JUST the bushings? I see a repair kit in
motorworks catalog for about $35 bucks, but I just need the bushings
(I think).
