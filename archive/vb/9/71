I feel your pain Thomas, I've got a 16 year old and an 8 year old, the usual
household bills and obligations, I'd like to restore my bus, but then I
wonder if I;d still be comfortable camping in a muddy campsite, driving down
a gravel road etc..
My bus is presentable, 99% of the people who see it don't notice that it's
not perfect and, as I age and begin to sag, I find it comforting that my bus
does also.
It's nature's way I guess.
