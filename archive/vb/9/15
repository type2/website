Subject: Emblem Clips?

Gang:

I have a new emblem for my 55', actually the only emblem I have every had
for it, and need to know how to make it stay on.  From what I understand
there are clips for the back, however I have never seen any and am wondering
what to us.  Is this something that you can purchase from Bus Boys, or
Ronnie?  Or, can I just get them from a hardware store?  Thanks in advance.

-Wayne
