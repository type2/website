Subject: tire pressure


i am going to try and call bridgestone tomorrow... their web site seems
to infer that if your vehicle manufacturer says to use 35 psi at 3600
pounds axle weight (or whatever the weight of the car is), that is the
MINIMUM you should run... lower, and you are overloading the tire.
leading to >boom<.
if you ADD weight, the tire must have air ADDED to that psi number,
subject to the total limits on the tire.
in my case, 65 lbs psi at a load of 1740 per tire (3400+ lbs per axle -
what did we decide a bus weighs, 5400 or so?) means i can go UP TO 1500
lbs of crap in the car, and still have the (fully inflated) tires handle
the load. don't know about the motor tho :) i am curious if they think
the 35 is too low for the tire, and recommend some intermediate
presssure; it was mentioned that most makers have a chart showing
load/psi ratios - i would like one for my tire!!
the 603v is an LT tire, with stiffened sidewalls, btw.

my pal lewis thinks some of my road wandering will go away with the
lower pressure - i've been running them at 35 psi for a week, and can't
really tell............
