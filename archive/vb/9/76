Subject: Bus Sickness

You know, I have been driving busses for 25 years (newest was a '72).  Spent
my honeymoon night in a westy in the Howard Johnson parking lot in Erie PA.
(My wife still brings that up now and again...and not with a pleasant tone
of voice I assure you)  I have NEVER had a "good bodied" bus and am not sure
I really want one.  Besides losing the appeal it also turns my bus into "an
investment".  But the thought of having one that will, hopefully, never need
any body work again (other than maintenance) sure sounds nice.   This body
work guy is, by all accounts in the state,  THE guy to restore your vehicle.
He is around 35 and has been in business in the same place for 15 years.  If
I don't do something the bus has a life of about 5 to 7 years.  If I don't
go through with a restoration how can I keep the old girl going?  I am not
one of those show guys.  If I restore it it will be for the sake of the bus.
But if I restore it will the bus loose its personality?  What do you guys do
to keep the bodies up so they don't crumble around you?  In the past mine
have always eventually hit the junk yard.  HELP!
Thomas
