Subject: Re: [VB] gear reduction box to spring plate bolts

actually there are 4 each side- the 4th one is kinda hidden by the rear 
shock.   You really need all four bolts to safely hold the RGBox on, sounds 
like one is working loose already.   You need to get those broken off ones 
out.  I have seen some time they are drilled out and tapped oversized.  You 
should get 8.8 hardness bolts0- that is what VW used.  Hardware store or a 
specialised store like Mr Metric or Tacoma Screw. 

I also saw someone weld the RGBox to the spring plate.  Which did hold for 
years.  The NextNNO flipped the bus and I bought it at the salvage auction 
and had fun removing the tranny.
