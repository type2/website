I don't want to be argumentative, but I guess I'll have to be.  

I ran 50PSI in the 185R14 Load Range D tires on my '71 and did a very good job of balding the middle of the tire.

That's a fact.

They were designed to be strong enough to hold this much pressure if _needed_ to carry their maximum design load, which at 1850 
pounds is a lot more than a bus tire will ever carry.  Remember that the VW spec is about 1540 pounds maximum load.

A tire is designed to have a certain amount of deflection by the load while in operation.  This deflection spreads the load evenly across the 
tread.  If you put 1850 pounds on this tire, you would need 65PSI to get the correct deflection.  At lesser loads you need less pressure to 
produce the same deflection for an even loading and even wear.

Here's a web site that shows the relationship between pressure and load.  Scroll down a bit an note that the correct pressure for a D-rated 
tire is the same as the pressure for a lesser rating, such as the "reinforced" european rating, at the same loading.  It's the loading that 
matters, not the tire.

The ratings I quoted were from VW for 185R14 radial tires.  That's the tire in question here.
