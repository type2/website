Subject: That rattle - was this it?


Some of you may recall the strange rattle I had at speed in my 60 panel. 
(and some of you have even heard it, but not the cam rattle - that *is*
fixed)  It was an annoying rattle that came up thru the shifter.  I replaced the
trans - didn't fix it.  Replaced the generator and fan (had some ovalling)  -
didn't fix it.  I climbed under there today and poked around.  I noticed
that the two lowest bolts for the motor mounts were too long, and were actually
hitting the transmission case.  This was a bear of a job, but somehow I
got the new ones in.  It's very obvious from the small indentations on the
tranny case where they were hitting.  The upper bolts of the motor mounts 
are the same length, but I can't tell if they're rubbing.   The engine would
have to come out to get to those :(
