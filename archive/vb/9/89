Subject: RE: [VB] gear reduction box to spring plate bolts

If memory serves me correctly, those bolts are:
- 12x1.5x25 hex head bolt.... possibly 19mm head.

But, to find out yourself, go to vintagebus.com and look in the parts
manual!

Ive been slowly going over my bus in recent days. looking for problems
that could haunt me down the road. I am planning an 1800+mile journey
this october and I would prefer for it to go smoothly. Whilst inspecting
the underside of the engine today, I noticed that my driver side gear
reduction box to spring plate had only 2 of 3 bolts in it. It appears
the bolt has broken off inside the box. On the other side however, much
to my surprise, only the top one of the 3 bolts was attached to the
spring plate and the box is sitting a little off kilter. I think the
bolts are 19mm. Where would I go about aquiring suitable replacements?
