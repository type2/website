Subject: Sundial Windows?

Does anyone need some of the larger (size of Westy windows) Sundial Camper
Windows.  I have five of them.  Three work fine, one is missing the small
plastic guide (in the garage somewhere) and the other will only roll to
about 1 inch of closing, same with the one missing the plastic.  I'd love to
trade then for Westy windows or anything I need for my 66.  Will consider
cash offer also.

Dave
