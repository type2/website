Subject: Tire Pressures

Hi all, I've been lurking on this list a while and feel I must chime in on 
this tire pressure debate.  Tires do not give a reccomended pressure on the 
sidewall, all the sidewall says is 'max load xxxx at max pressure xx', and 
that is exactly what it means.  No one, either vehicle manufacturer or tire 
manufacturer recomends that max pressure at anything less than max load.  
Leaving aside the Firestone/Ford debate for the moment, car makers give a 
reccomended pressure for a certain tire size on a certain vehicle, 
regardless of the brand or load rating of the tire, and every tire maker I 
have seen says to follow that reccomended spec.

Some have argued that VW specs were based on 30 year old bias ply technology 
and therefore are no longer relevant.  So what do we do for a spec now?  My 
suggestion is to take the 'max load at max pressure' stamped on the sidewall 
of your tire and use it as a ratio to determine the proper pressure for the 
load you are putting on it.  So I went out to my bus and looked at the plate 
on the overhead air vent that lists the GVWR (at least that's what I'm 
assuming it is, I can't read German, so someone correct me if I'm wrong).  
This is the *gross* weight that a bus is rated by VW to be able to safely 
handle, that is weight of the bus itself plus all passengers and cargo.  My 
bus lists 950 kg on the front axle, and 1150 kg on the rear.  Divide this by 
two (for the weight on each tire), and we get 475 kg on the front tires and 
575 kg on the rears, or about 1045 lbs and 1265 lbs respectively.  My tires 
(185r14 Michelin Agilis) list a max load of 1710 lbs at 54 psi.  Now we use 
these numbers as a ratio to determine the correct psi for my bus fuly 
loaded.  The equations look something like this, where x equals the optimal 
pressure for my given weight:

      Front                      Rear
     x       54               x       54
    ---  =  ----             ---  =  ----
   1045     1710            1265     1710

       x = 33                   x = 40

This gives us 33 psi on a fully loaded front axle, and 40 psi on a fully 
loaded rear axle, which sound pretty familiar, don't they?  May VW did know 
what they were talking about when they were talking about after all...
