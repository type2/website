well, around here there dont salt the roads, so if you dont do anything the 
holes in the front floor and the rockers just get bigger from rain leaking 
in.   So I replace windsheild seal.   I did paint my 65 westy about 3 
1/2years ago- ya I was a bit cautious for a while, but I got over it.   It is 
nice to have a shiny bus, and nice shiny new paint dash.  The bus now has a 
collection of tiny rock chips and chips where someone opened their door into 
the bus in a parking lot and a few cracks through the paint and both 
windsheilds are cracked from roads rocks.  Still looks real good though.  Its 
been sitting since April when I started driving my 15 window - lots of  
rocker rot, old bondo, holes in front floors, faded 40 year old paint, for 
the summer.    Looks as the weather is turned, though, I might park the 15 
window in the back shed soon.  I would love to fix that one up, just time and 
money you know.  But I'll keep it out of the rain I guess that  helps.
