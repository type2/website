Subject: Wanted 64 to 71 Westy

Hi Volks,
I have a friend who is looking for a good running bus. He is mostly
concerned with the running gear. It must run and drive well since he will
probably drive it home ( I'm in Calif and he's in Kansas). He has experience
in Body and paint so don't pass on sending me a bus for sale if it has body
damage. Splitty is first choice and an early Bay next. Please let me know
what you or a friend might have for sale. Cash buyer no fooling.
Thanks for any help you can give me.
