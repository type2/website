Subject: RE: [VB] Brake Emergency

Thanks to all who have posted.  The emergency part of the message was
actually meant to refer to the fact I need my truck by tomorrow morning.
Several have suggested that I tighten up the bolt to square things up.
I tried this and all it managed to do was make the peddle assembly to
tight to function.  With regards to the replaced spring, it looks much
like the old one but it hard to say if I have it on right since I have
nothing to go by to see if it's right.  It looks like it would function
right if the arm didn't come in contact with the frame.  I'm at a loss
here.  Oh yeah, what was the consensus about bench bleeding?  I didn't
but now I'm wondering.  Thanks again.

I am in the process of swapping out my single master cylinder for a dual
and installing a new return spring which was non existent.  I have all
the lines run and I am putting the assembly back together.  My problem
is, The metal arm coming down from the peddle is hitting the frame.  The
peddle seems to be pushed for some reason to the left.  I can pull the
arm toward the passenger side and move it freely up and down but as soon
as I let go it returns to rubbing up against the frame.  I believe this
has something to do with the spring I added but now I can't even get the
bolt off because the side opposite the bolt turns.  The other side is
slotted for what looks like a screwdriver but there is not enough grab
to hold it while I turn a wrench on the other side.  I need my truck
tomorrow for work so any help now would deeply be appreciated.
