I am in the process of swapping out my single master cylinder for a dual
and installing a new return spring which was non existent.  I have all
the lines run and I am putting the assembly back together.  My problem
is, The metal arm coming down from the peddle is hitting the frame.  The
peddle seems to be pushed for some reason to the left.  I can pull the
arm toward the passenger side and move it freely up and down but as soon
as I let go it returns to rubbing up against the frame.  I believe this
has something to do with the spring I added but now I can't even get the
bolt off because the side opposite the bolt turns.  The other side is
slotted for what looks like a screwdriver but there is not enough grab
to hold it while I turn a wrench on the other side.  I need my truck
tomorrow for work so any help now would deeply be appreciated.
