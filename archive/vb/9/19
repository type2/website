Subject: Re: [VB] Emblem Clips?

I've always bought speed clips from the hardware store.  They don't have the
exact size so I pick one a little bit smaller and drill it out a tiny bit.

I usually pick up some fiber buffers for over the shafts too - it protects
the paint (or primer, haha).  One of my original emblems had the padded
washers on there so I figure it's original?

I have a new emblem for my 55', actually the only emblem I have every had
for it, and need to know how to make it stay on.  From what I understand
there are clips for the back, however I have never seen any and am wondering
what to us.  Is this something that you can purchase from Bus Boys, or
Ronnie?  Or, can I just get them from a hardware store?  Thanks in advance.
