 I stand with the let her age group!!! Show her you
love her even when you dont want your friends to see
you with her in public anymore.....She is still that
little hottie under all that bubbled out rusted
backside....In your eyes....And she can still take you
to those dirt road canyon mountain top highs you
remember without the pain of new paint coating gravel
and not your bus blues.....Save your money for your
kids..Speaking as a poor 48 year old kid of a rich Dad...hahahaha
