Subject: Repro Metal Question

As i was finishing up some areas on the 21 today, i peeled back the rubber 
for the cargo doors.  The rocker is completey solid except for the rubber 
channel and the "sill?"

So anyways, the middle seat mounts are different than on the 66 and i need to 
know the best source for a repro as well as for the "sill?" piece.  I wont 
mind buying a full rocker and just hack that piece off it they come with it.

What does the almighty list suggest?
