a similar thing was done to my 61 15 window-  the PO had put a 64-65 front 
beam in it, he said the original beam had gotten so sploppy he just swapped 
it out ten year before.    The 66 beam also has the anti sway bar- which 
theoretically helps it corner better.  The practical thing about this is that 
you have larger 64-67(1ton) brakes than the 55-63 (3/4ton).  Brakes cylinders 
are cheaper - as they are available brazilian for the 64-67 and only German 
for the earlier style.  Evidently link pins are easier to find, but spindles 
are harder to find.   Wolfgang in Redding now buys core 64-67 spindles for 
$50- paid for gas on my last trip back from California.  They are conviently 
located not far from the I-5 .    

If you end up putting the 1 ton RGBoxes on the back you get the one ton 
brakes in the back, it is really good to have the one ton brakes in the front.
