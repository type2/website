Just to muddy the waters, you have to get two pressures, one for the front and one for the back axle.  You also have to get two different 
pressures for full load and 3/4 load conditions on the back axle.  How much of the time do you actually carry a ton of cargo in your bus?

No.  They were referring to radial ply tires, just like the ones we are using now.  I agree that specs for bias ply tires aren't usable, but the 
radial tire specifications are fine.

The charts you refer to exist, but for some reason tire manufacturers hold them very close to the vest.  I've seen them at tire shops and 
there are a few on the web, but I haven't found anything for the 185R14 Load Range D tire.

I use the VW specifications and get good even tire wear.  When I tried a little shadetree engineering and increased the pressure, the tires 
wore out in the middle.  It's pretty obvious to me that VW knows what they are talking about here.
