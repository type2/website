Subject: Unpacking the bus

Okay well a whole week has gone by and finally got some stuff moved around
in the garage so I could unpack the goodies I got from RMMWs scratch, dent,
and ding sale.  I never know what I'm looking for until find it so what did
I come home with?  A 72 to 74 bus heater box with very minor damage (I think
it's the left side one but not for certain), 2 type 4 dual EMPI exhausts -
one used and one so new it still has the cardboard, banding, and EMPI
sticker included, a Super Beetle towbar from Rob in exhange for the
generator swap for $10 (with a twisted piece of C-channel on the part that
bolts to the car - what in the heck went on with that???),  and a T1 dual
quiet pack and header system with the flange on the header installed wrong.
A little griding and rewelding and she'll be good as new.  Paid $25 for the
combo I think.

I got the T4 EMPI exhausts for my T4 project.  To buy one new from RMMW
would have cost me $121.37 so I saved more money yet on what is supposed to
be a rather expensive way to go on engines.  Here's what I've got so far:

new P/C set for 2L        $20  (Thanks to Karl von Saltzen)
Gasket set             $24 (ebay)
2 exhausts              $15 for the used one
main bearings         $5
Weber T4 intakes    $35

Total:                            $99

Retail from RMMW on this is as follows:

P/C set            $345.00
Gasket set    $73.95
exhaust            $121.37
main bearings    $47.95
T4 intakes???

Total:                $588.27  (this doesn't include the intakes - no idea
what they are new.)

So yes, T4's are more expensive to rebuild but they don't have to be if you
aren't in a hurry.

Another fascinating aspect to this used T4 exhaust I got is the letter that
was returned with it when he sent it back to RMMW.  It's from a Mr. Thomas
Dunbar but we won't say where he lives for fear his buddies might read this
and beat him up.  It reads as follows:

To Whom It May Concern:

    I am sending back this exhaust for 2 reasons.  #1 It sits lower on the
passenger side. (Nice hand drawn picture included with a caption and arrow
that reads, "This side WAY too low."

#2  It sounds like hell.  It sounds like the baffles are wrong or something.
I even replaced the cheap paper gaskets with metal/cruch gaskets.  It still
sounds raspy, gargly, & leaky.

I am disappointed in the time I waisted (wrong spelling) taking off the old
exhaust (well gee - it had to come off anyway didn't it?), putting on the
bad/new one, then replacing the gaskets, then finally putting the old
exhaust back on, which sound great (what happened to sounds like hell???),
just old and rusty.  Please send me a receipt showing the credit to my
credit card.  The total credit is to also include the shipping charges.
Sorry and thank-you for your time.
====================================

Okay well I can't believe he actually ran this exhaust (the paint it burned
off the header portion) and then returned it expecting full credit.  I would
just hang on to it and ebay it or something.  The nerve of some people.  I
don't care what my exhaust sounds like as long as there aren't any holes in
it, it's good enough for me.

So anyway, I spent about $80 to $90 (thanks to Rob's bargaining powers) on
stuff that would have cost me $300 to $400 new.  Not bad.

I figured out a new place to hang my ratchet straps in my bus too tonight -
on the back jail bars!!!  Purty nifty place!!!

That's about it - just wanted to share this with you all..
