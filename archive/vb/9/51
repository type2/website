Hey List,
Is there a way to put handles with locks on my '63 DC or should I head down
to the hardware store and buy padlocks and hasps and possibly a length of
chain ??

Pete and Buck, Poteau, OK,  .7 mile to the Sonic..... and other
attrcations.........


p.s. The title says '63, but the chassis # indicates a '62 if that makes a
difference..
