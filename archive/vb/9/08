 I did that about 2 months ago.  There've only been tiny amounts of rust
 particles on the magnet and it didn't help at all.  I actually pulled it
out
 thinking maybe it was blocking the fuel from getting out of the tank
 somehow.

Hmm... from what I remember when I pulled the tank, this screen was
conspicuously absent.  Actually, I could stick my finger right into the gas
tank through the gas fitting hole.  Maybe I'll try draining the tank and
taking that fitting off to poke around for crud.  Exploratory surgery, so to
speak.  Hopefully I'll find just one big piece of crud....
