Subject: What a mess....

Hi Bus People   Ok,I never wrote I was a great VW
engine man...or a great VW anything.Even I know
exhaust valves should not have parts missing from
them.I took the heads off the little 1200 I got for
100 bucks 3 years ago which had run find until
now.Well off come the heads and it looks as if mice
had been chewing at the exhaust valves.There is enough
metal missing in #1 and #2 to almost stick a push rod
thru there between valve and head.And #3 is on its
way....#4 was cool.No wonder she would only do 45
mph.....By the way I guess VW's dont use head gaskets?
I did not see one....strange.Well now what? Food for
the marine life near here or put new valves in...
clean her up and give her another shot at life... bus
style.My bet is on a new turnkey 1600 sp or bigger?
Anyone want to tell me their thoughts about what went
wrong with the old 1200? I am a clean slate on VW's
any help might save a new engine from the same end.  Thanks.....
