Subject: fuel flow problems

So.  Been having some trouble lately with gas not wanting to get from my gas
tank to the fuel pump.  My driving pattern lately goes like this:
1.  Driving along, nice and happy, engine just up and quits.
2.  Coast to the side of the road (if I'm lucky and there is one) stop van.
Now, the motor will usually start up again but if I drive away it will quit
right away.
3.  Pull off fuel line from gas tank to fuel pump.  No gas.
4.  Blow in hose, wiggle it, stick a wire up it, or some combination of
these actions until gas is coming out of the line.
5.  Replace fuel line.
6.  Drive away.
7.  Repeat.

Last night I did this 6 times in a two hour drive on the freeway.  It's
getting incredibly frustrating, not to mention dangerous.  I pulled the gas
tank and dumped a whole lot of crud out of it about 5 months ago, because
the fuel filter was getting clogged too quickly.  But this is much worse.
I'm just wondering if there is anything else (other than crud in the gas
tank) that could cause this problem (fuel pump?) because it seems odd to me,
mostly because I can start it again but it stalls as soon as I drive away.
And because sometimes I don't do anything, I just take the line off and wait
about 30 seconds and gas will start pouring out again.  Sigh.
Mmm... is that that new gasoline perfume I smell?
