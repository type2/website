The tires you have are D rated which means that they have an 8 ply
construction. You should definatly run them at 59 to the max of 65. Any more
and the center line will bald, and any less and the edges will bald and this
is a fact. The tires were designed to have this higher psi in them. The old
manual or shop psi ratings for the bus tires dont apply in the least because
the tires are completly different.

I hope I helped you with you tire pressure problem
