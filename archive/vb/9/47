Subject: RE: [VB] re: tire pressure/ tire markings

I agree with Jim here, but have some to add...
From my Ch3vy racing days, we dragged HUGE tires in tubbed cars at
ridiculous speeds (or at least that was the intent)
Tires have a max pressure cold for a particular weight meant to bear, this
is taking into accouint PV=nrT, as the tire heat increases, so will the
pressure inside it, hence "MAX Press COLD". A 65 6 or 8 ply wil take alot
more that 65 at high heat, since it will increase pressure due to road
friction creating heat. Road racing tires often have release valves to blled
the overage to maintain an ideal pressure, until you let em cool and then
you have to refill em, since temp decreased and pressure was reduced to
below the ideal you hoped for, after you park her.
We often lowered tubed tires or tubeless (screwed to rim) slicks to like
10psi, trying to get maximum tire rippling and traction (I always thought
this increased my times, instead of helping). By going too low, the tire
cannot support the car corrcetly for steet purposes, so handling and tire
life will suffer, and even blowout can occur.
Tire pressure should not be considered a specific setting, a particular car
with a particular tire will have an ideal pressure based on load, what you
are driving on (surface), conditions (sand, snow, hot pavement, etc).
Perhaps they should provide a curve of ideal pressure vs vehicle weights,
min to max, which are the important safety settings.
Besides a bike tire, or a huge weight class E 16 truck tire, anything you
slap on a stock wide 5 should function without sidewall failure at the stock
tire psi. I believe most run near 40psi in the rear for busses that carry
some weight. If your tires are rated beyond the actual or expected loaded
weight of the vehicle, they don't NEED to have 65 psi, and they might be a
little large around the center tread, making for uneven wear, if you are
grossly underweight.
If you are carringing near the tire max (hope not), fell safe with a sturdy
tire that you can slap 60+ lbs in, otherwise you can fel safe with like 35+
onj a unloaded to lightly loaded bus. Too low, handling and tire life
suffer, which is probably the under 30 range , but that IS dependant on tire
and vehicle, 30 might handle like crap and even look 'low', so you might
need a little more.

Craig asked about tire pressures, and what is written
on tire sidewalls.

The tire pressure on the sidewall of the tire is the
SAFE Maximum tire pressure, NOT the recommended tire
pressure.  The vehicle owners manual or sticker in the
vehicle tells the recommended pressure for that
vehicle, as long as it doesn't exceed the pressure
limitation on the tire sidewall markings.
