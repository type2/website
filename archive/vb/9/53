I can accept Paypal, although I don't have an automated system in place to
do so. What you'd have to do is enter an order by phone or the website,
using the payment option of "I will mail you a check or money order." Then,
instead of mailing a payment, just paypal it to me instead,  at
ron(-at-)busdepot.com   (last name on account: Salmon) and I will apply it to
your order.  Please do NOT paypal to any other email address or it will not
be credited toward your order.

Please be sure to reference the order when you make the payment (specify the
date you placed the order, the name it was under, whether you placed it by
phone or web, and if possible the order number).  Please note that if you
are paying Paypal using a credit card, I must ship to the Paypal
verified/confirmed address. I may waive this with customers who have been
long-time Bus Depot customers as I know you're who you say you are. :-)

Payment via Paypal costs me more than taking a credit card.  I will ask that
if you opt to pay that way, you add an additional 1% of the selling price
($1 per $100), with a $1.00 minimum, to the total to help me cover that cost
difference. Paypal does not like anyone charging a "surcharge" for their
service, so if anyone complains about that I'd just have to stop taking
Paypal for Bus Depot orders. But the other alternative would be to charge
everybody more money to cover the few who used Paypal, which I think would
be less fair.
