Subject: Re: [VB] That rattle - was this it?

may i suggest 2 things to maybe remedy this problem. first, check/replace
the shift rod bushing for the front shift rod. get a genuine vw one,
they're only about $5. second, try greasing the ball/ball socket of the
shifter/shift rod. pull the shifter off and pack it full down in the
socket. use good, thick, heavy grease.
another more of a PITA problem may be the 2 long shift rod bushings being
worn out. only way to fix that is to remove the tranny.
