Subject: Awesome Buskatiers VW pictures

Our valiant web master Keith Petite is getting the pictures put up on the
website of last weeks' RMMW/Bandimere show and caravan.  A LOT of different
photos were taken and it's gonna take him a while to get them all posted
however, one of the BEST photos was this shot at 11 mile campgrounds that
features a storm blackened sky, beautiful rainbow, Keith's wife and son, and
Dan Kinsey's 1958 Binz Crew Cab and Rob Laffoon's 1966 SC at the end of a
rainbow.  Very cool shot.

The rest of the photos can be found piece meal at

Enjoy!
