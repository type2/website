Subject: Re: [VB] tire pressure confuising?


I can only give annactodal evidence.

I bought load range D tires in 1992. They had a psi rating of 50. I ran them 
at 32 front and 35 rear. They were on a 1970. A year later they were on a 
1969 westy. Same pressure. I then put them on a 1963 in 1996. Same pressure. 
Now all these busses were my only means of transportation and at the time I 
drove all over the place, my work was 20 miles away, and I made annual trips 
to many destinations. On the 63 alone I was going to east of seattle from 
olympia WA 2 times per month, averaging 140 miles or more round trip. I 
finally traded the bus this year. And the tires are still on it, and they 
are still within drivable specs, with even wear. I would guess they are 
nearing 50,000 miles at least. I mean it was 1992 and now its 2001, and if I 
averaged 10,000 miles a year, and thats conservative, we have 90,000 miles 
right?
They probably are nearing the end, but I say set your tire psi to a little 
over VW specs, 32 to 40 would seem right, and you are a happy camper.

When the guys put on my tires, they set them to the VW recommended spec, and 
assuming liability might be an issue, they seem to be correct.
