There's and OLD mechanic's trick to get around the air
in the cylinder in a pinch.  (Did anybody else ever
read the series in Popular Mechanics about Gus
Wilson's  Garage in the 50's?)

Take the brake drum off, and put a clamp across the
shoes (protect the shoes from fluid somehow);  then
take your thinnest feeler gauge and peel back the boot
from the upper area of your wheel cylinder, and
carefully insert the feeler gauge between the cylinder
and piston.  This will cause a little area around
either side of the gauge by the rubber cup which you
can utilize to pump out the last little bit of air.

I use a special homemade tool to hold the brake pedal
down while removing the feeler gauge, but that's
another story.  You should be good to go.  This tip is
only for emergency situations where money or parts
availability disallows doing it right.  I accept no
liability for the use of any of my old timey tips: 
i.e. don't do this at home, kids.
