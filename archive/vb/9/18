Subject: RE: [VB] Emblem Clips?

Taylor,

Thanks for the quick response.  I have seen someone else do that and the
truth is those taps and dies scare me, I have em, just don't like to use em.
The metal on the shaft doesn't look that great either -- really low grade.

I took mine off to repaint it a while back and just about tore the heck out 
of the original clips.  I really didn't like them anyway, so I motored over 
to my dad's...he's got a tap and die set, so we tapped the studs and found 
some 8 or 10mm nuts to fit them!  It's a little tough to get up in there 
and cinch each one down, but it's gonna keep the emblem on there real good!
