Subject: Needed...

Well, I picked up the free EZ camper this weekend, and I am very happy with it. Took the dog (Great
Dane) for a ride and he liked it and had room too. So I'm going to leave the camper interior in it
for now, but I want to make it back into a Panel and get rid of those funky windows. So I'm looking
for 2 sets (it's a DD) of clean (rust free & fairly straight) Panel cargo doors. Velvet green would
be nice, but I'm not too picky.

Greg
