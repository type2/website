Subject: RE: [VB]  Cheap Taiwan/China parts screw me!!!

and this is shocking news how? 
when i worked at a vw shop i tried my hardest to dissuade people from
throwing their money away on those POS pulleys. even the brazil regular
ones are not worth it. usual reply: "but they're so cheap"
 i've seen them grenade into lotsa little pieces, leaving the driver stuck
in BFE. 
the only good solution, other than the price, is to buy a genuine GERMAN VW
pulley (12V), still available through VW, and other various VW shops. they
are about $29-34 depending, but they are far and away superior to any
aftermarket i've seen. plus, they actually weigh about twice the weight of
the POS aftermarket ones, too--more metal. plus, always use a new key in
the generator slot.
unfortunately, i don't know about 6V availability, or the outrageous price
for a correct pulley for a 38amp 68-71 bus style generator.
just remember: "the bitterness of poor quality remains long after the
sweetness of low price is forgotten"
