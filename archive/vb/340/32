Subject: Re: [VB] Elastic cord and crimper ring source?

(Hey, JP) I made a few sets last weekend using flat brass, a punch and I hand bent mine using an original one as a template. They came out pretty good and I'll have a few sets at OCTO for sale if anyones interested. 
I used flat brass because that is how the originals were on my '62 flipseat and '65 SO42, and don't appear to be made from tubular stock because the ends both "grab" the two pieces of cord. 
 
Jp, what year/camper model did you model yours after?

For the "crimper rings", go to a hobby store and get
the correct diameter of brass tubing you need. Then,
after ovalizing it and making your bungee material
loop, use a small chisel to close the ring down onto
the cord from both sides. Then, in order to make it
look perfect (and so the material won't slip) make two
dents on each cord on the back of the ring (the side
against the wall) with a very sharp punch. This makes
it look exactly like the original. Don't worry if you
puncture the brass; that's how the originals were.
