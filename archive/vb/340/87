I agree with Ted, keep the stock system working well plus the door and
window seals in good shape for the moderate cold.  But on the other hand,
for really cold weather and window ice, there is NOTHING better than a
properly working gas heater.  The stock system will only defrost the front
windows, a properly working gas heater will defrost ALL the windows and
doesn't need the engine running to do so!!

Step out in the cold 15 minutes before you leave and turn on your gas
heater, by the time you're ready to fire up the bus, the temps inside will
be nice and toasty not to mention the windows will be clear.  Also, if you
stop for a short time, shut the engine off, but leave the heater running,
when you come back your bus will be nice and warm, no need to race the
engine and hold your hands over the defroster vent, just take off your coat
and enjoy the ride.

Keeping the stock heating system functioning correctly gives you windshield

I like to generally keep things
stock, but if I have this auxiliary heating system-any reason to keep the
heat exchangers?

Thanks for any suggestions/comments....
