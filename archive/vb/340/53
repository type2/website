I had sent a email asking for help identify some parts I found. I need to know what the nose in these pictures (vw find album) belongs to and what that rear quarter belongs to.
I am assuming the nose belongs to a 356??
I am also not sure what the chrome bumpette belongs to and what year the bug stuff is.
I did find out the vent window goes to a early bus(decided to keep that). the inner nose panel is spoken for.The rest is for sale. Make an offer.
 
Thanks again for the help,
