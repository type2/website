Subject: Start Button in Engine Compartment

The recent conversation on hard starting when busses are warm has had me
thinking about installing a start button in the engine compartment. My '66
beetle has a button installed under the rear seat that will frequently start
the engine when the ignition switch will not.

Has anyone had experience with such a button and what is the best way to go
about installing one?

I put about 250 miles on my  '66 Westy yesterday and after I got home I
couldn't start it with the ignition switch. I have a feeling that if I had a
button in the engine bay it would have cranked right over.

By the way...I have gained a tremendous amount of knowledge about my bus
through the years by being a member of this list. Even though some of the
participants have moved on to other things, I'm glad that some of the list
faithful are sticking around. I like to contribute when I can and I am very
appreciative of the advice I've been given.
Thanks
John Flowers
