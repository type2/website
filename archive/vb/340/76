This happened twice to a friend of mine in his 62 Kombi. The
second time led to the bus rolling over and being scrapped.

When I stripped his bus for parts I found that the locating
pins, springs and lock washers for the rear brake shoes were
missing.

These parts hold the brake shoes securely in place. You can
tell if yours are missing by glancing at the back of the
brake backing plate. If the locating pins are missing you
will be able to see the holes where they go through the
backing plates.

The locating pins are easy parts to overlook, but they are
essential to safe operation of your brakes.
