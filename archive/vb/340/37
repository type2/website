Subject: Bouncy Bus -- Shock Absorber Recs

After hitting a series of bumps that caused my stock 64 Standard to
bounce around a lot vertically, my 13 year old daughter, who is more
into the internet than cars, looked at me and said, "Dad, you need new
shock waves on this thing!"

Well, I guess I do, and I am interested to know what shocks the group
is using for the smoothest ride. I see Boge, KYB and many others
available, and I'd like to know what y'all know about these options.

Thanks in advance,
