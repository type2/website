Subject: exhaust

Well,

It looks like my muffler has kicked it. It's getting very loud, and when I
looked at it today, it looks like it is disintegrating.

Some thoughts regarding replacement...

My goals
1)quiet! I'm not into a load exhaust
2)longevity, ie don't rust within a week of installation
3)extra power-I've heard your exhaust system affects this...

I've had what I think is the dual quiet-pak exhaust, and heat exchangers.

I just saw a ceramic coated exhaust just like mine. Pretty sweet
looking-what do you guys think about these, anyone had any long term
experience with them-do they really last longer?

I'm about to install a gas heater(I hope)-so my other question is about my
heat exchangers-removing them and replacing with J-Tubes? Does this give
better performance. Don't get me wrong, I like to generally keep things
stock, but if I have this auxiliary heating system-any reason to keep the
heat exchangers?

Thanks for any suggestions/comments....
