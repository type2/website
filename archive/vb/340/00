Hi Ellis,
Too bad.  We were just posting our experience/opinion and did not mean  to 
ruin your day! ;-)

Maybe, but we were not looking to compare those!

We never said they would not, but that they only cured a single problem and  
not the mirid other that can be caused by electrical resistance.

>>  4.> Long <hot> wires all the way forward to  ignition switch and ALL of

basics.
 
Well we would not describe it as a "sh*t design", but a simpler one.
  As for seperate circuits this would only happen if there was a  seperate 
power wire from the rest of the wiring system.  This would mean a  wire would go 
from the main power terminal on the starter soliniod and go  directly to the 
ignition switch and then back to the coil and starter  soliniod.
 Instead the main power for the wiring harness comes from the  starter 
soliniod and goes to the fuse box.
  ALL the electrical power from this wire goes through the FUSE  BOX.  IE in 
our 1963 SC this connection to the fuse box got so hot with  55/60 H-4s the 
fuse box plastic sagged because of electrical resistance  between the loosely 
fitted/corroded brass clips of the fuse box!
Additionally the main power from the fuse box does not go directly to the  
ignition switch!!!  Instead this flow of electricity goes THROUGH possibly  
loose or corroded connections on the headlight  switch.    
      Just because one lives in a hot dry  climate does not mean they can not 
endure loose and/or corroded  connections!!
  Sorry you got so bent out of shape and we hope it was just a bad day  for 
you!
