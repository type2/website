Subject: JBB Carabus Route Change

Hi Volks,

A suggestion has been made and corrections approved to the flight plan 
for the Carabus heading to John Brown's Buses on Friday October 15th.

We're still leaving Lake Erie State Park in the Brocton NY area at 9AM 
sharp, and taking Rt.5 west to I-79. The change is that we're going to 
bypass the Penna Turnpike and continue south past Pittsburgh on I-79 to 
I-68. I-68 will take us to I-70 and finish with a very scenic back-road 
route into Harper's Ferry from I-81.

The route has been switched to I-68 for a number of reasons: the 
pavement is better, the traffic less frantic, there aren't any tolls 
and the scenery is Excellent. It adds about 35 miles to the trip but 
it's still cheaper than paying the tolls and the construction on the 
Penna would probably have eaten up the time savings.

Email me if you're interested in hooking up with the group.

event.
