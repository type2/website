stock exhaust...

you don't have a 1776 or bigger so having a single qp isn't going to do much for
you in the way of performance.  I have a decent used stock muffler you can have 
if you want - it just needs a new tailpipe. The stan w. (65 dd ) uses one of those
cool kymco ceramic coat single qp on his bus.  A got a new stock one last winter
that has held up nice and seems the quitest to me... I tried an empi single qp on
my bs and it rusted within one week, didn't fit too well and looked bad from the
back.
