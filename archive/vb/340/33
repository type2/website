Subject: ambulance fan switch?

didn't someone post a long while back about using some sort of american car
switch as an ambulance fan switch? or does anyone have a switch or knob for
sale?

this weekend i went back to where i bought my 23 a couple years ago, to pick
up the last three buses that came with it. i had never really looked too hard
at any of them, as i didn't really want them, they just came with the package
deal. i was suprised to find that one of them had a set of ambulance fans that
i have unknowingly owned for 2 years! very sweet find as they are og dove blue
and will go nicely in my 57 panel. the only problem is that i am missing (at
least) the chrome ring and knob. i have the switch base with a bulb in it, but
nothing else.
