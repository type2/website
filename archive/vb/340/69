Subject: Re: [VB] Re: What shocks do you prefer

  I use KYB GR2's on about every bus I own. If I want the mush ride I would use oil shocks only. KYB GR2 are an oil 
based shock with a shot of nitrogen to help soften the compression stroke of the shock. Most oil shock only work on 
rebound with very little compression dampning. That is the reason KYB's seem so firm, the work in both directions.
  KONI's are great but hard to find and $$$ they have adjustable valvinginthem tat works great. Ask the 356 Porsche 
guys.
   On my buses that carry loads I use KYB Gas-a-just in the rear only and I recomend these to any one who has a 
heavy camper and/or carries a heavy load, really keeps the rear from swaying and helps hold around the corners.
   If you are are on a budget, AUTOZONE has a great cheap gas.oil shock for around 14.95 each, with a lifetime 
warrenty. I compared these to about every oil shock I have tried and for the price can't be beat.

  So for a mushy ride buy oil, for a little more control and firmer ride GR 2 or equivilent and for all out better handleing 
use Gas-a-just or equivilent.

Spoken from experience. Based on split window buses of my own and comments from customers with bays.
