We are very sorry to hear of the loss of Bill to his family, friends and the
Type 2 community.  While I don't believe that we ever met him personally,
through JP's stories and the more recent reports, we still feel his loss and
send our thoughts and best wishes to all who knew Bill personally.

Keep his memory alive!
