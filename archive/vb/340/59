Subject: Re: [VB] front spindle nut

With all the other suggestions, if it helps any, K & D Tools used to make
a special two-wrench set for these nuts. They are 27 mm size. The
two-wrench set consists of a thin straight open-end 27 wrench, plus
another one which has been bent at two right angles, first out then back
straight again. This allows you to properly manipulate both nuts. I've got
a set, and wouldn't part with'em for anything. Bought'em long time ago.

Alternately, as one other has said, find a thin 27mm wrench for the inner
nut, and use another type, possibly an adjustable wrench at an angle, for
the outer nut movements.

Don't forget that the left side nuts are reverse threaded so that they
tend to tighten with forward wheel motion.
