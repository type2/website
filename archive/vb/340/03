I've been on the opposite end of this scenario.
I do dropped spindles, and every once in awhile I'll get a call from a 
customer telling me exactly what you're saying.
What I tell them is this.....

The 3 notches that usually (in stock arrangement) go against the control 
arms now (lowered arrangement) go on the outside away from the control 
arms. Once they spin them in the proper direction all problems are gone.

As for needing a "special tool" to switch something. I think the special 
tool is your foot in their ass, and your money back!
