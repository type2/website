Well I didn't even look at the Bentley or Muir for this - just did them as I 
would any bearing of that type.

Use a brass drift to knock the old race out, and used that old race as a 
drift to knock the new one in.  Don't think I had to even grind the edges of 
the bearing to ensure it didn't get stuck because of the easy access

Is it bad to do this then?
