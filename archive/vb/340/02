Subject: dropped spindles--dropped faith

I don't believe there's a worse feeling in the world than when you loose faith
in your VW mechanic. The splittie
has been in a shop for two weeks-haven't heard a word
about anything --good or bad--i stopped in over the weekend to"check up" on
her and the mechanic was showing me that the dropped spindles i just spent
400bucks for wasn't lining up--the top where the king pin goes was 1/2 inch
away--even with all 7 or 8 shims in--
i guess the shop called "the people" in california to ask what the deal was
with these spindles---i'm getting some song & dance crap about needing a
special tool to switch something on these new spindles.has anybody ever been
through the lowered spindle shuffle? any advice would be
greatly appreciated KEEP KOOL
