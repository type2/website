Subject: Re: [VB] rear wheel cylinder failure

   If you used a VARGA master cylinder as the replacement you will need to grind/cut off some material off the rod. I 
have found this needed to be done on 62 to 66 buses. Why these years I do not know, but those are the years I have 
had to do this to. None of my 1960 buses have needed this as I had enough adjustment in the rod to get clearence.
   I have never replaced the master in a 61 so I cannot say (but have sold plenty to people with 61's and nobody 
mentioned a problem). I also found this to be needed when using the FAG/FTE and other names they go by so call 
Made in Germany master cylinders (current supply)
