Subject: RE: remote start switch

My last bus had the push-button remote start mounted in the hole created by
the triangle shaped gusset/brace just to the right of the hatch opening,
next to the battery.
I usually install the headlight relay for a hard starting bus but still got
plenty of use out of the remote start when timing the bus or adjusting a new
carb etc.  no starting the bus and running to the back trying to catch the
throttle linkage before the engine dies!
