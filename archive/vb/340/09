Subject: RE: 67 front wheel bearing races?

I replaced all inner and outer wheel bearings in my 70 westy myself,
without any special tools.

Subject: 67 front wheel bearing races?

Is it possible to remove and replace the outer races of the front wheel
bearings in a 67 (roller bearings) without using a hydraulic press?
Bentley and Muir seem to say no, but I was wondering if anyone had other
ideas...

Thanks,
Rusty
67 Westy
