Hi All,

Does anyone know of a source of information on these three (SO-42, SO-43, SO-44) versions of the Westfalia?  I have found good info on the SO-23, but I would like to know how the later three differ.  How do you tell the difference?  For that matter, the cabinetry of the Sundial looks very similar to a Westfalia, are there obvious differences?

I'm working off of pictures more than in-person contact, so maybe the differences are obvious in-person.

Thanks,

Clark
