keep the heater boxes, and use the gas heater as an auxialliary (sp?)   it 
makes a difference both in comfort and gas milage (BTDT).  unless it is in the 
30s out, I find the stock heat is fine once the bus is warmed up, and the gas 
heater is great for instant heat and defogging of windows, and an additional 
heat when it is freezing out.

I've run both stock mufflers and headers, and like the stock muffler better, 
but that's just me.  the 65 has a header cause of the filter pump making a 
stock one not fit.  I prefer the sound of stock.   Often I can pick up cheap 
headers at swaps, and tend to put them on the dubs I'm not keeping.
