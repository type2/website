Subject: Re: [VB] rear wheel cylinder failure

Hi there.

Concerning the master Cylinder, I'm facing the same pushing rod length
problem...
I rebuilt the MC and wheel cylinders and replaced the shoe pads and set the
MC rod to VW specs, but now the brakes are always slighly engaged, the bus
will drive, but is hard to move by hand, the wheels are slowed down
permanently, and the brake signals are on.

Would this be a MC problem (4 months old) or related to the push rod ?
