Hi John,
The wiring in one of those switches is simple.  You just want to have  the 
electricity go from the positive terminal that the positive cables from the  
battery, regulator, and to the dash are, and have the new switch and two wires  
provide a pathway to the small electrical connection also on the solinoid.   
Make sure to get a high amp push button switch from a FLAPS.  As to  mounting 
the switch and making sure the wiring does not get worn through the  wiring 
insulation is the big problem.
 
  Before all of this though take a voltage meter and slide under your  bus.  
Take off the small wire on the solinoid and have someone else turn  the 
ignition switch (tranny in nuetral just in case!) and take a voltage  reading.  
Check this reading against the voltage at the battery  terminals.  
  We had simular problems with both our buses this year.  Turned  out the 
starter bushing was worn to the point that any futher wear  would have cut into 
the tranny in the 1960 panel walk thru with 12  volt system and 6 volt starter.
  In our 1963 SC voltage drop between the battery and starter solinoid  was 
about .2 volts.  Checked ground straps (tranny to body was  loose), replaced 
starter bushing, with no luck.  Finally replaced the  starter, it now turns over 
MUCH better and starts right  up.
