A bunch of us including JP camped next to Bill (-at-) the last Jerome Jamboree.
He had a wonderful set up in Melvan, the stickered camper, complete w/ pink
flamingos & a hitchhiker that Bill picked up on the way & offered to share
his hospitality to.  After hanging w/ all of us for a while, Bill went
around & quickly collected $25-30 to give to the H. hiker to buy raffle
tickets with.  That is the way Bill & Janet are- always interested in
helping others, living the VW bus life, & passionate in environmental/
artistic & political causes.

Although I have spent time at other campouts w/ Bill, I will most treasure
the 3 days we hung out right before this last period of his life began. He
is truly 1 of the most interesting volks I have ever met, & the VW bus scene
will be missing 1 of it's greatest champions.

Pax to Bill & Janet & their daughters.
