Subject: RE: bad bus day/accident

i was returning from a show a couple weeks ago and people were being such 
a$$#%?&s on the freeway. i was cruising along at my small nut speed of 52mph 
and people were delibereately moving to the left about 6 inches behind me 
and then cutting back in front while laying on their horn... as if to say to 
me, "how DARE you drive that speed!!!!"

now granted i drive fast in my daily driver 325hp Subaru, but soooo many 
drivers display such a malicious sense of urgency while driving that i 
almost dont want to drive the split sometimes :-(
