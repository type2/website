Pretty simple actually, get a heavy duty push button
starter switch, I got one for $8 at AutoZone. The
switch has two terminals on it.  Connect a wire from
one of these terminals to the small push on connector
on the starter solenoid (if your solenoid only has 1
push on, then you may have to splice) then attach a
wire to the other terminal on the button switch and
run it to a slot in your fuse box which is hot ONLY
WHEN THE KEY IS TURNED IN THE "ON" POSITION (in the
bug where I just did this, it was the second slot from
the right, use your voltmeter to be sure, though)
Mount the switch somewhere and thats it!
