Hi Tom,
The drums you installed were they new or used?  Did you measure the  inner 
diameter of the drums to MAKE SURE they were within factory specs??

yet repaired)  <<
That in itself should be setting off flashing red lights and klaxon  blaring 
in you mind!!  Even slightly resting your foot on the brake  pedal will 
prevent the relief valve/s in the MC to stay closed, and with each  braking increase 
brake fluid pressure till brake shoes burn up or wear down  and blow out one 
of the wheel/slave cylinder.  So without a brake pedal  return spring the 
brake pedal pushes agains the MC!

>>  note on the master cylinder: one thing that's been  bugging me after 
replacing the master cylinder is that even though i've adjusted  the pedal 
adjuster screw, the master cylinder plunger seems a tad (1/8") too  long.  i.e. with 
the brake pedal adjust bolt is backed out all the way, the  master cylinder 
plunger seems like its slightly engaged (i.e. slightly pushed  in).  I assume 
this isn't normal.  Is this just the fact that it's a  crappy aftermarket part.

Eric when in the USAF got a MC for our 1963 SC from the VW  dealership in 
Abilene TX and had the same problem you describe.  Turned out  the pedal stop 
that keeps the brake pedal from coming up had to be VERY slightly  bent forward 
to allow for the proper spacing between the MC and brake pedal push  rod.  
Without the spacing you will have the very same affect of using the  brake pedal 
as a foot rest!
  We hope you have been using a dual MC all this time!  Otherwise  you lost 
all braking ability each time the wheel/slave cylinder blew out.
