Coincidentally, there is a thread today on the Type 2 list about a new (to
the U.S.) shock that I highly recommend, from AlKo Suspension.  In a
nutshell these are Boges only better. They're oil filled like the Boges, so
they have a smoother ride than KYB's (which are sometimes criticized as
being a bit harsh). But they're noticably beefier than the Boges, and are
European made (and T.U.V. approved) whereas the Boges are now all Mexican
made.  These are probably the closest thing to real German O.E. shocks that
you can get today. I initially started selling them a couple of years ago
for the Vanagon, based on the recommendation of Just Kampers in the U.K.,
who had received glowing reports on them from their customers. After
receiving similar feedback from my own customers, I added the Bus
applications, and they have been received equally well. To quote from the
today's Type 2 List thread ...

They're $35.95 each ... <http://busdepot.com/details.jsp?partnumber=AL1449>

For those who want to go on the cheap, I also have a closeout on Boge
shocks.  These are packaged under the Technum brand name, which Boge used in
some foreign markets. Boge switched to the Boge name in those markets, and
sold me some extras that were still in Technum boxes. (The shocks inside are
the same Boges, only the boxes are different.)  While I wouldn't recommend
these equally to the AlKo's, they're impossible to beat for this price...

They're $19.95 each ...

Unfortunately, availability on both of these is limited. I only have a dozen
or so sets of the Boges left at this price, and then they go back up. As for
the AlKo's, while I will be carrying them on an ongoing basis, I can never
seem to get enough to meet demand.  They go on backorder for months at a
time. I just got more in, after a backorder that lasted all summer. And I've
already been told not to expect any more for another two months when the
ones I have now are gone.
