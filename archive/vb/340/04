Subject: Oklahoma City help

Hi All,

I'm a recent subscriber, and have purchased a bus in Oklahoma City.  I live in California, and will have to have a company truck it the 1600 miles to my town.   This bus hasn't moved in a year, and apparently the brakes are locked (handbrake on).  This will increase the cost of shipping dramatically.  Does anyone know a trustworthy somebody in the Oklahoma City area that I can hire to smack the drums with a mallot and free it up?  Has anyone had any experience with a car moving company they would like to recommend?

Yes, I know I must be nuts moving a bus to California, the land of buses....

Thank you!

Clark
