Right, assuming you have an internal-regulator alternator.  Fat red wire
from the body wiring harness goes to B+ on the alternator or regulator.
Skinny blue wire goes to 61 on the alternator or regulator.  DF and D+
on the regulator go to the wires coming from inside the generator.

If I was doing this, I'd run a fairly stout (12-14 gauge) ground wire
from the generator body to one of the regulator mounting feet on the
shroud.  Some generators have a screw threaded into the top of the
housing for this purpose.

Not to belabor the obvious, but you might also check for sameness of
connectors.  The alternator stud might need a ring terminal while the
generator regulator might need a wide push-on.  Make a jumper out of
12, 10, or 8 gauge wire with a female wide push-on on one end and a
ring terminal on the other.  Keep the jumper wire plugged into the
regulator, with a bolt, nut, and two washers through the ring terminal.
At swap time, unbolt the fat red wire from the alternator stud, bolt
it to the jumper ring terminal, and tape up the whole mess so it
doesn't ground out.
