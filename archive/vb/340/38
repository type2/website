Subject: Bill Colville R. I. P.

I got a call this morning that Bill Colville finally
let go and died during the night.  We are missing a
great presence; Bill was a wonderful man, a gentle
giant, and Janet deserves our commiserations.  I know
of none other in this community who did more to make a
campout more enjoyable or who was willing to share his
humor and wisdom than Bill.

Send any cards or letters to:

Janet Colville
1350 Pigeon Rd.
Las Cruces, NM
88007

Thank you, Bill for your friendship..

JP
