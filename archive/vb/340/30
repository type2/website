Friends of Bill,

I just returned to Albuquerque from a couple nights
with the Colville family in Las Cruces, Bill and Janet
and their daughters Becca and Ely.  Bill is completely
non-responsive since his strokes have blinded him,
paralysed his right side, and caused bleeding in his
brain.  He has been off life support since Saturday. 
I've been reading to him from VW magazines and the
newspaper, hoping he's still hearing us.  His only
comfort, other than the family, is morphine for pain.

He can't last much longer, and for anyone wanting to
give their best wishes, they can be reached at this
address:

The Colvilles
1350 Pigeon Rd.
Las Cruces, NM
88007

Bill and Janet have been wonderful camping partners,
and I'll miss him greatly.  Thanks for reading,

JP
