Subject: More on hump back seats

Thanks for all who helped me with the stitch questions
last week.  The seat cover is done and it looks real
nice.  Fit's like a glove.  
I will post pictures soon.

My seat base has issues now as the PO cut off the two
arms that stop the seat back on the bottom.  

Anyone have an old base that they want to get rid
of??? If not, can anyone out there measure theres and
let me know the dimensions so i can fab a new set?

Thanks

Matthew
