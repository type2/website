Bentley says 1 mm clearance.  It also says this is to prevent the
cup on the master cylinder piston from covering the compensating
port, which is where fluid is exchanged between the reservoir and
the "working" part of the system.  "If the port becomes blocked it
will prevent the fluid from flowing back to the reservoir when it
heats up (continuous braking on hills).  The fluid will then expand
towards the wheel cylinders where it will overcome the return spring
pressure and cause the brakes to bind continuously (brake light will
remain on)." (Page B-2 2 of the '63-'67 Bentley).

The only thing I have to add is that if the above is happening, it
seems reasonable to me that it would show up on the right rear first.
That wheel cylinder is the furthest from the master cylinder, and
so has the longest amount of fluid in the lines ready to expand and
push the piston out.

FWIW, when I did the brakes on my '64, I used the later style dual
circuit master cylinder (I splurged on the German) and the spacer
ring (big aluminum doughnut) to make it fit.  The spacer ring ID
was sized for the slightly smaller nose of the Brazilian master
cylinder, but a little grinding fixed that.  I didn't have any
trouble getting the required clearance at the push rod, though.
