Hi, I am familiar with a man in Ardmore, or at least Earl Mann was still 
alive about 15 years ago, last time I was through Ardmore, OK.  Anyway, 
he did great work and was very knowledgeable.  Perhaps if no one on the 
list can recommend a shop in OK City, Earl might. Oh and in regard to 
moving companies.  The expensive transporters for classic cars are 
perhaps your best bet, and will guarantee a closed transporter.  I 
researched this a great deal when moving my bus from Texas to Colorado, 
but from fear of open trailers and the many bad stories I read about 
auto transporters, led me to rent a budget truck and do it myself-- time 
and money of course.
Best, Karen
