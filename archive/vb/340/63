Subject: rear wheel cylinder failure

about a mile from my house this morning, I lost a rear wheel cylinder 
(passenger) on my 1967 Freedom Camper.

This is the third time that location cylinder has failed in 6,000 miles.

After the first failure, I installed new brake pads, thinking I didn't 
have enough meat on them and the plunger on the cylinder was 
over-extending past the o-ring.

After the second, I replaced the rear drums, thinking that they were 
worn beyond spec and didn't have enough meat on them.  Again, the 
plunger had over-extended past the o-ring.

So, prior to this failure, I had adjusted my rear brakes 1,000 miles 
ago, pads have lots of meat on them and drums have ~2,000 miles on 
them.  I haven't pulled the wheel and drum yet to see what happened, 
but I'm a bit miffed.

Any preliminary thoughts on this?

I know that the PO didn't have any of these problems, so I'm inclined 
to believe that it's something I've done.  Things that I've done since 
purchase:

i) replaced all the flex hoses
ii) flushed and replaced the brake fluid
iii) replaced the master cylinder (see  note below)
iv) noted that the return spring on the brake pedal is inoperable (not 
yet repaired)
v) replaced pads and cylinders all around
vi) adjusted the e-brake cables

i->v were all done prior to the first failure.

note on the master cylinder: one thing that's been bugging me after 
replacing the master cylinder is that even though i've adjusted the 
pedal adjuster screw, the master cylinder plunger seems a tad (1/8") 
too long.  i.e. with the brake pedal adjust bolt is backed out all the 
way, the master cylinder plunger seems like its slightly engaged (i.e. 
slightly pushed in).  I assume this isn't normal.  Is this just the 
fact that it's a crappy aftermarket part.  Could this be my problem?  
(The pedal adj. bolt i'm referring to is in the Front of the bus, that 
you use to adjust the freeplay between when the brake pedal contacts 
the master cylinder plunger).

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Thanks,
	Tom
