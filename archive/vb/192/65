   Looking for something for yourself or a loved one (your bus) for the
Holidays, well here you go

Complete 1962 to 1971 U S spec tail light assemblies, buckets, seals, bezel,
lens but no bulb, all for 30 dollars a PAIR and to top it off we will
include a EMPI coffee mug (over 5 dollar retail value). This price is plus
UPS shipping.

This is limited time (till mugs are gone) and am offering this to the list
only as a THANK-YOU for supporting
