Subject: turbo vs. street screamer

Thanks for all the replies first.  Thanks for all the
support after my injury second.  What size engines do
list members run in their buses?  A low compression
1641 turbo charged engine should have a running
temperature pretty equal to the type1 engines punched
above 2000.  Are those running in the bugs only?  I'll
mostly be driving short distances like at the most
three hours.  If I head from the Bay to Lake Tahoe
would that probably melt my engine?  I was thinking of
adapting the type4 cooler to the doghouse, and a
external oil cooler above the transaxle with electric
fan too keep things cool.  I could add those older
plastic scoops on the side of the vents if that would
help bring in cooler air.  That would be a last resort
as I wanted mostly a streamlined look.  Thanks for
your experience.
