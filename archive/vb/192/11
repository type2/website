Kevin, never had a problem with using 8 dowel cranks with factory 4 dowel fly
wheels when the pattern and dowel size is the same. There was 6mm and 8mm
dowels out there so make sure you get the right crank. Also make sure you are
not getting a wedge mated crank, it won't work with a factory fly wheel.

Subject: [VB] CW crank and flywheel


I'm still working on rebuilding my engine in my bus. I'm putting it back to
stock 1600 DP except for
the crank. I'm going with a CW crank and I guess I'm going with the SCAT CW
new cast crank (good
price, seems adequate for a stock rebuild).

My question however, concerns the flywheel. The SCAT crank is 8 dowel and
there is nothing wrong
with my stock flywheel. Should (or can) I just remove 4 dowels from the new
crank? If not, should I
get a new FW or get the old one machined?
