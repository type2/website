I have a 60 Double Cab with factory 15" wheels that have 205/70/15
pirelli scorpians on them. It depends on what you mean by fit. The tire
manufacturers do not recommend putting those tires on a wheel that
narrow. So you have to make your own judgment call on that. I am happy
with mine so far.
Good luck,
Craig
