Subject: Re: [VB] Disc Brakes on Front??

To All,
I have replaced my front beam and brakes, and love the result.
I found a 68 beam with ball joints, which bolts to my 67 bus.
I then bought the late bay discs and calipers. 
I used my 67 (one year only, split system) master cylinder which has adequate 
fluid volume for the discs. I had recently replaced it with a new one. If I 
was doing over, there are other M/C options in the archives.
I added the proportioning valve from a bay bus to drop the pressure in the 
rear circuit.
I also had to add a "pre tensioning" device to the front circuit. These are 
integrated into master cylinders designed for disc brakes. It keeps 1/2 to 1 
LB of brake fluid pressure to the calipers (but not the circuit for the 
drums/shoes in back) to keep the front pads close to the disc. I found this 
at a shop that specializes in dune buggy and race parts. Folks who fabricate 
whole cars need this kind of stuff.
I did not use the vacuum powered brake pressure assist device from the bay 
window, on advice from the folks at Bus Boys. They were right. You don't need 
the power assist. My wife and daughter can easily generate enough pedal 
pressure to lock the brakes.
I am a very happy driver. 
I did note that the ride height with the ball joint suspension was 2-3 inches 
higher in front than the old king pin suspension. I bought and installed the 
Albatross front beam from Bus Boys to lower the front BUT ONLY BACK TO STOCK 
HEIGHT. 
No slammed bus for me. I think the stock ride height is just fine. 
Future projects include the Bus Boys (probably) rear IRS conversion with some 
drive ratio changes to accommodate the rev needs of the 1800 SP that I am 
planning to replace the high revving 1600 DP with extractor exhaust that sees 
4500+ rpm on the freeways in SoCal.
