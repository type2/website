Changed out the PP today, and surprisingly I have pedal!  The change went
off without a hitch.  I just needed an excuse to pull my motor, but it is
COLD up here!  In Florida, my engine pullin' attire consisted of board
shorts.  No shirt, no shoes, just shorts.  Now I am wearing jeans, two
shirts, and two thermals!  This makes for A LOT more laundry.
