Subject: Re: [VB] Split bus tow bar?

About 15 years ago I converted a bug tow bar to a bus/bug tow bar(no one
made a tow bar for a bus at that time). The beam on a bus is larger in
diameter than a bug so I had to make new brackets to go over the beam out of
1/4" steel plate. I found tubing that would slide over the tubing of the tow
bar to lenghten it about 18" and I think the tubes were cut to 24"(tow bar
is in Big Bear so going by memory here). I used a 2 x 4 cut to fit between
the brackets then secured between them before i cut the tow bar so the
brackets would stay square. Cut it, slipped the tubing in then welded it
back together. I cut off the bug brackets but left about 1" on the tow bar
to weld the new brackets to. I cut 2 brackets to fit over the bus beam tube.
One side I was able to weld tubes on the top for a pin to secure it. The
other side I made the 2 uprights longer and had a plate that bolted across
the top to secure that side. If the tow bar does not have any bracing I
would reccomend bracing it from tube to tube with an X brace for rigidity.
The modification took about 2 hrs with mainly a grinder, cutting torch,
drill and an arc welder and has towed many a bus alot of miles. It will also
tow bugs and ghias with no problem except a little slop at the beam
connectors. It would not tow a late bay bus (tried it on my '68 panel) due
to a bracket interfering with one of the beam brackets. If you have an old
tow bar and the tools mentioned give it a shot. Also one other thing is have
your bus there to test fit along the way.
