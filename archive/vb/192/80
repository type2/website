Hi Gary,
So far we have only heard of one heat exchanger that was leaky inside the 
tin.  Most likely the area the dounut seal on the rear ends of the exchangers 
is rusted down to the point that it does not seal against the inside of the 
dounut seals.  This can be welded and ground back down or new section of pipe 
welded in place (Do not use the exchanger hammer in repair it restricts the 
flow!).  Next likely is a leaky muffler and engine compartment seal.  Last 
likely is the heat exchangers were pushed forward (Which happens often with 
extactor type mufflers that hang down so far.) and you will need to bend the 
sealing surfaces of the exchanger as flat as possible and file the rest of 
the way flat.
  As far as replacement exchangers the cheapy Dansk ones do not have the fins 
inside the tube where the hot exhaust air passes through.   This causes the 
exhaust not to cool and condense and in turn creates back pressure against 
all cylinders, which in turn pushes the engine and its oil temp way up.  
Which is why VW only used this version for less than a year in late 1963 and 
very O'dark early 64 model years.  You can actually see the fins in stock 
post- very early 1964 exchangers by peering with one eye with a flashlight 
against the side of your head up the rear tubes of the heat exchangers.  
Reportedly there is a higher priced Dansk exchanger with interior fins that 
you can buy, but we would rather have rebuilt stock ones!
