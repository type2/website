Subject: re:heat exchangers

before jumping to replace the heat exchangers, i would double/triple check
all connections. my bus gets a bad smell when i run the heat, but it doesn't
smeel like exhaust, i think it is something else, maybe some oil or grease
or lubricant got spilled on the heat pipe mufflers(at least i think that is
what happened to mine)

good luck
