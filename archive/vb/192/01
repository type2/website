Subject: Disk Brakes on Front??

My experience with the front brakes on the first generation buses is that the stock VW drums brakes are more than adequate. VW designed the front drums on the heaveier buses so that both shoes are leading edge shoes, hence two slave cylinders on the front hub. Just keep all the brake componets within VW operating specs and your stopping distance in a bus will be fine. I can lock 'em up on any one of my buses and the front wheels will burn rubber.

Some of the important maintenance specs that I feel need attention are: drain, then flush the entire hydraulic system at least once each year, verify that all shoes are installed with no binding points, be sure to use brake grease on the shoe-to-backing plate pivot points, keep the brakes shoes centered and adjusted evenly during the routine adjustment procedure, keep the master cylinder push rod adjusted so that there is minimum play between the master  cylinder actuator and the push rod, keep the shoes adjusted as tight as possible to the brake drum, and keep your drums clean and turn them as necessary ( take no more that 0.010" at a time- they don't have to be perfect).

Hope this helps, again my buses will stand you on your head when necessary!!!
