Volksfriends,

Yesterday, under my son's supervision, I checked out my electrical problem.
We have a nice color blowup of the schematic, so it was a matter of following
the line from the battery.  Didn't have to go very far.

Jacked up the rear end, put jacks underneath both sides, crawlerd under to the
starter/solenoid and there's the problem, dangling wires, . . .  when I hooked
her up last spring, I forgot to put a nut on the bolt at the end of the
solenoid, or whatever.  Quick, easy fix.

I tried to use those little metal snaps for my interior (from TMI)  What a
pain in the A.  I gave up and I'm using stainless steel finish washers and
oval screws, at least on the top and bottom of the front doors, impossible on
the sides.  I assume the rest of the panels in the back will screw in without
problems.  I did use visquine over the blue bubble stuff for insulation . . .
from Home Depot.

REAL REASON FOR THIS POST,
I forgot who the owner of this list is, but I need to go off for a couple of
weeks, as tomaui I go under the knife for some moderate surgery, out two to
three weeks,  I will get back on as soon as I am up and around . . . got to
finish that interior, rewire the heater boxes and put in some seat belts!

Best to all for a happy holiday season,

Curt
'66 . . .
