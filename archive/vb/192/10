Subject: [VB] RE: Giant Bees--

As Mr. Jess suggested, some folks would recommend smoking them out from the
inside. I counter/add to the mix by suggesting inviting a bunch of "honeys" to
run around the outside. No, I didnt say "homies" but Stan, Steve and the rest
of the HOMIES are sure to be there per the usual.
No excuses about missing the NFL on that weekend... NASCAR Howard can always
watch the left turn action on the mobile TV.
Health provided, my family will BEE there!
