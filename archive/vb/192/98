Subject: JCWhitney tie rod removal tool - not worth the money

Hi,

Just for the record, this tool is worthless in my opinion. It cost $9 + 
$9 shipping (rip) and does not do the job. It is hard to keep mounted 
on the joint/union area. The bolt that is used to push out the tie rod 
bolt, spins off when tightened (it should be bigger with a recessed end 
or have a welded on flat cap to increase surface area). This is one of 
those tools that seems "fashioned" after an original tool - but not 
produced by a tools company.

I have successfully used a pickle fork - but I was hoping for something 
a little less destructive.

Conrad
