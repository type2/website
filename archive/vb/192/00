Subject: Winter Stuck Accelerator Cable VW Drama Mystery Solved!

Splitnosers,

  Hmmm, every winter the accelator pedal seems frozen in the WOT position,
completly disappears in the summer, gee, what could that be?

  Well, stuck on the side of the road, about 0F with windchill, pull the
pedal pan, accelerator linkage seems to want to ride up the pole by the
nifty spring clip, take it apart, put it back together, same thing
happens?  Check the cable and it is stuck!  Crap, brain and extremities
are getting numb, time passes, go to engine bay, disconnect throttle
linkage, pull on cable in front and rear, twist slightly and metal end
fishing weight slug brakes off! Very Numb feeling in hands, feet and
brain. Nice thoughts on what epitaph do I want on my tombstone, maybe a VW
logo and Partiers Wanted :^)

  Back Grim Reaper....Voila! A heated garage nearby is commondered, have
shaky help goosing throttle and sideloader limps to heated garage.
Luckily, Ronnie sent me a spare accelerator cable and I found it!  Make
microhook and pull new throttle cable in front to back, stuck about it is
the lowest part, Hmmm..  Heat lowest part and pull cable with needle nose
plyers, water comes out and I'm inching it out.  2+2=?

  Numbness ends and hear triumphfant trumpeters striking up my favorite
marching music! Damn cable was frozen in water!

Best,
joe
