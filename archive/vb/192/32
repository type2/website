Subject: FW:  Vanagon hitch Available at Mid-Atlantic Holiday Bus Fest

I'm sure my neighbors will be unhappy to see our block turned into a flea
market Saturday, so folks, please keep your swapping discrete!

With that caveat, I'm forwarding this note about an opportunity to pick up a
trailer hitch (and copying the type2 lists so those folks don't set up any
card tables in my driveway either :-) . 

Anyway, I know Dennis' hitches are great.
 No  commercial interest on my part, of course.

Hi Tom,
Will you please forward this to folks who maybe interested.  I have a Hitch 
for a vanagon that was made by Dennis Haynes.  I used it only once then 
decided to sell the Vanagon  Asking $200 or BO. I can bring it to The 
Holiday Bus Fest. Thanks
