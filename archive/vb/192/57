Subject: Re: [VB] Rear torsion bars?

         Good morning, folks. The rough dimensions of rear torsion bars 
from a 65 bus are:

23 1/4 inches long
1 7/16 inches in diameter at the ends

         These are rough dimensions, as I used a tape measure to eyeball 
it, not a set of calipers. Billy

Are they interchangeable with the Beetle ones?
