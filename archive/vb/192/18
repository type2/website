Subject: Vacuum Can Question

I have a vacuum can that came off a 71 bus distributor. According to www.oldvolkshome.com the can should be a 07 092.  How do I know if this is the right vacuum can or not?  Are other vacuum cans interchangeable for a 71 bus DP1600?

The only number on the can is 853 stamped on the vacuum arm.

 


Enjoy your day!
