I agree. I somehow got the bracket part to keep from slipping off (I
think this sounds like the same sort of gizmo I bought from them), but
the bolt actually bent when I tightened it and the tie rod end still
didn't come out, and the whole thing slipped off eventually anyway. I
had to just use the old-fashioned fork, maybe with a little expansion
from a propane torch (I was past worrying about being destructive!).
