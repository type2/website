Hi Joe,
Hopefully you greased the new accelerator cable thoughly as you were 
installing it.  Blowing out the tube with pressurized air to get out the last 
of the water really helps to rid the tube of the remains of the moisture.  
Having the front belly pan and the accelerator boden tube in the rear keeps 
the water out of that tubing.
