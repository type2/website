Subject: RE: [VB] Heat Exchangers

George is right. Even after replacing the heat exchangers I kept getting
exhaust in the heating system. I had to pull the engine anyway for the 500
mile retorque so I changed the engine compartment seals and made sure my tin
was not bent all out of shape. That solved most of the exhaust problem, but I
still got exhaust in the hot air when I came to a stop. It proved to be two
things there, bad exhaust tube donut and bad engine compartment door seal.
Everything working fine now !

It might not be the exchangers.  How are your seals around the engine bay?
You might be pulling exhaust back in and sending it through the heater.
Even with good seals, you can get exhaust smell if the bus is stationary
or backing up.

If your valve covers are leaky you can also experience smelly heat.

Exchangers are pretty thick.  I've never seen one with an internal leak.
