Adapters? I have heard some bad about these coming loose;
Tire - rim size.... I don't want to go original size tire... would 205 be 
too much?<

If you really want to setup your bus check out some ideas on the 
www.germanlook.com forum.

For the easy way just get some BRMs or EMPI 5 spokes.  They are 15" wheels 
and either 5.5" or 6" wide.  Fits right on drums.

For the Porsche Fuchs or any Porsche wheel you will need adaptors... Which 
are not good.

EMPI adaptors blow ass!  Try to get some German ones if you can find them. 
Yes, they do exist.  In the front I would not run adaptors at all though, 
just not that safe.

REAL Fuchs are expensive.  Fakes are fairly cheap and worthless.  Some 
people think the fakes are worth something, but they usually have no clue 
what a real Fuchs is.  I think cheap repoops are like $125 each new?

Try for Porsche Cookie Cutters or Phone Dials as they are good quality but 
fairly worthless.  Estimate 200-350 for a good set.  Poor sets can go for 
$150 or so.  Do not trust some of the crazy e-bay auctions with crazy 
reserves, watch an open auction and see how little activity they get.

Basically if you stay drum just get the BRMs.  Less work and looks good and 
cheaper and safe.

Later,
Adrian
