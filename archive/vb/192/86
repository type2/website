Hi Volks,
Duh!  That suddenly makes sense to us.  Eric when in the USAF occasionally 
made & often operated a vacuum cleaner that only used pressurized air as a 
power source to suck up drill shavings out of the areas of air craft he 
worked on.  Since the rear of the HE tin creates a bit of an off shoot area 
from the main area flow this creates the same vacuum and sucks in the exhaust 
through any rust holes in that area.
