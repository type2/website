It might not be the exchangers.  How are your seals around the engine bay?
You might be pulling exhaust back in and sending it through the heater.
Even with good seals, you can get exhaust smell if the bus is stationary
or backing up.

If your valve covers are leaky you can also experience smelly heat.

Exchangers are pretty thick.  I've never seen one with an internal leak.
