Subject: 5.8 liter Crewcab Saga on Hold

Have to put the crewcab and everything else on hold for awhile. Cut off part
of my right thumb Mon. at work and had to go through 2 hours of emergency
surgery. All seems OK but won't know how much they cut off until I go back to
the doc on Mon. Meanwhile I'm on a Vicodin ES buzz. Did get the crewcab
through inspection last Wed and all I need now to license it is the bond which
I get from my insurance man. Was hopeing to do that last Mon. Got the seats
bolted in and also got a real neat and safe throttle cable and housing from
Ronnie. Also a 1st, I installed a set of gauges in the crewcab, 1st gauges I
have ever had in a VW. Still need to hookup the stock gas tank and get rid of
the 6 gal red boat gas tank that is hooked up now. Will have it running safely
by BBB. Will also have to miss the ABC christmas party this weekend, big
bummer. Hope you all have a blast at the white tanks this weekend. Later
