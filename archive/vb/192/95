Subject: Re: [VB] My bus is killing me...

I had a bug that this kept happening too also.  I went through 2 Throw out
forks, 3 cables, 2 Pressure plates, 4 T.O. bearings, and about 20 T.O.
bearing clips before I figured out what was happening.  The bug was
converted to 12v by grinding the bellhousing (not the problem), and I stuck
in a dual port engine.  Well, guess what, I didn't change the pressure
plate.  The later engines/pressure plates do not match up with the early
throw out bearings.  I would make sure you have a pressure plate and clutch
from the same year that your tranny is, and also the throw out bearing and
arm.  Don't mix and match parts. I would need more specifics on your
transmission before I could tell you for sure what to use.

P.S. The parts that I used on my '65 bug were NOT an exaggeration, I don't
even want to know how much money I spent in the long run trying to get this
right.  But I chalk it up to experience,  I guarantee when this was all
happeneing, there wasn't a person around that could pull a bug engine faster
than me, practice, practice, practice.
