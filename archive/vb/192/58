these lines show where the pieces of metal are stuck together to make a bus.  
Take you book in havnd and go round the bus and compare.  The corner was 
pressed as one piece of metal to he roof- the lines show where the seams are. 
  I  think you also are shown the neat way the edges are joined together at 
the seams, sometimes in a complicated bend for strength. 

Remember they think you can go grab an NOS piece of metal off the pile to fix 
your bus.  But you can still replace the lower corner and hide the seam under 
the beltline trim.
