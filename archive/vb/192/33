Subject: Rear torsion bars?

This is a basic question I have never really seen any data on...

What are the stock rear torsion bars in a Split?  Specifically talking about 
the 64-67 busses.

Diameter and length would be great.

Are they interchangable with the Beetle ones?  Well depending on length of 
course, but most common being the 26 9/16" long units.

Thanks,
