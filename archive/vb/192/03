I think that the animosity comes from the fact that the owner of the
lowered bus has the engineering expertise to make major functional
changes in the suspension, but apparently is incapable of solving the
minor consequences of the changes.

It seems to me that a sawzall would solve the problem handily.  Keep the
sawn-off parts and make them into fender skirts.  When you need to
remove the tire, you first take off the skirts, just like a '50s Cadillac!
