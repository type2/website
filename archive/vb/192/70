I did the similar thing as Rex & George, but mounted Bose 6 x 9's which are
designed for outdoors/underwater/high vibration conditions!  All these
conditions were present in the 63 DC, so why not!  Sounds great, but not
recommended in a hi theft area, which I 'm not in.  I also took the Bose
labels off the speakers which made em look more generic, FWIW.
