Hello Dave   That should be about a Mar 1968 motor , were 1500cc  when built 
. can be made into a 1600cc just by putting on 85.5 P&Ls . look  at the oil 
pump studs. are they 8mm or 6 mm   the 8 mm cases had  problems with a wak alloy 
mix that caused cracks and head studs pulling from the  case itself.  You can 
install case savers to help with that problem. Not  the best year cases to 
build on but can work. Later  Mark  Dearing
