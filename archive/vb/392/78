Glad I kept my original 1964 fuel pump. Only 311,000 miles on it. Still 
seems fresh with all the original parts. I disassembled and inspected it 
just before installing it onto my new 1776.

The fine Brosol 20 dollar fuel pump failed within the first month.  Gas
 flowed right through into the engine and out the drain plug when hooked up 
with no
 carb in place, no engine running, just the fuel lines hooked onto the pump.
 Correct length rod, etc. etc.  BAP gave me a new one but I am not sure I 
want
 it......   NYUK NYUK NYUK

 Anybody getting the old German ones anymore????
