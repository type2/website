Subject: Suitable engine???

When I bought my 64 bus the fella gave me a bunch of VW parts he was storing
inside.  One of which was an engine stripped down about half way.  Engine
serial number is H0963393.  The best I can figure out about this case is
that it is a 1500.  What I'd like to know is this a decent core to start
with or can I even use it as I'd like to have the displacement between 1600
- 1834?  Can anybody give me some more info about this engine?

Thanks

Dave
