Subject: Re: [VB] Dimmer relay source (12volt)

But it goes thru a dimmer relay.  I know 66/67 had them and prior was a 
switch on the floor.  Can't believe someones not repoing these.  There's a 
hella NOS one on the Samba but I haven't heard back from the person.  Them 
there is one from a Bug, but not sure if they work the same.
