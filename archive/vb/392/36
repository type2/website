Congratulations on having a bus with known history. I inherited a 64 double 
door camper bus from my Dad in 1972. Drove it about 200,000 miles, parked it 
for a few years and then sent it out for restoration. The old girl spent 
about a year at the shop, but came back looking beautiful.
In my opinion, well worth it. I spent about 5 times the original price for 
the restoration. I could have spent more. This was a full on strip it down, 
clean out all the rust, replace the rusty spots, paint with zinc primer 
everywhere reachable, and 5 coats of paint on top of the primer. I finished 
it off with a 3.88 freeway flier tranee and a 1776 engine.

Best of luck.

Chris
