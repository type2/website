Subject: Re: [VB] Towing with a Dolly

If the bus starts swerving violently from left to right DO NOT slam on the
brakes, do not touch the brakes, hit the gas. I almost lost my bus coming
down the pass on the I-15 in So Cal. Towing it behind my parents Explorer,
hit the brakes and it started swerving even more violently almost tipped the
Explorer too.

PS still have the bus, it survived
