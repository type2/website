Subject: RE: [VB] '66 Restoration

I don't know about England, but for some reason, anything made after '78 
seems to get a low priority in the shop.  If the word 'resto' is used, 
anything below a year is considered quick.  The best advice I can give is to 
be your own resto manager.  Make a punch list, and "contract out" the steps. 
  NEVER pay in advance, research everyone before they do the work.  Don't be 
a pain, but don't let them forget you're waiting for the work, and allways 
get written estimates.
