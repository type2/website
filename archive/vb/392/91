Subject: Carb observations and questions

Hi,

Purely random trivia:

I bought a Bocar 34PICT carb for a '72 Beetle. I now have 4 carbs  
plus a couple on engines which gives me a chance to compare. Anyways,  
I'm fighting a poor running engine (at idle) and read in the service  
manual that the float valve could be the problem. I pulled off the  
top of the new carb and the float valve is smaller in height and uses  
a 9/16" wrench to remove it vs. the larger float valves on my other  
carbs (including another Bocar) which use a 14mm wrench.

Observation:

The reason I was there in the first place was chasing down a supposed  
intake leak. It seems to me the single port manifold system does a  
better job of ensuring a vacuum than the dualport system. The same  
point of failure is obviously under the carb. I wonder why with the  
dualport end castings don't have a deeper groove in the castings and  
a nice copper o-ring to seal the ends up.

Question:

Is anyone using one of the Empi single 40 or 44mm carb kits? I plan  
on putting a 1776 in my '65 bus and have a dual Kadron kit (that I  
was going to send to LowBugget to have rebuilt) but why bother if a  
single 40mm gives me good reliability and streetability.
