Subject: Re: [VB] Fuel shut off solenoid?

Hi Brooksdj,
First for what specific reason?  VW used ones for shutting off the  idle fuel 
in the carb to prevent run on, or used a cable pulled/pushed reserve  switch 
attached to the outlet of the gas tank.  The latter we use on all  our VWs 
because then you can shut off the fuel and change flex fuel lines  without 
pouring the entire tank of fuel all over.
