You can  use a 40hp case and drop a 69mm in without any case modifications 
but you'd  have to use the later tin as far as i know. You can machine the 40 HP 
rods to  fit on a 69mm crank and that would keep the 40hp tin the same. Other 
than a  big bore 40hp kit or 77mm I think you have to bore the case for 
different  p/c's.

Think of it this way-ever try and fit a 40hp  muffler on a 1300, 1600 or 1500?



hey Sean  You will have to space the clylinders out from the case when  doing 
this , This will cause a slight gap if you use the 40hp tin, which can be  
sealed. You will also have to spread the muffler to fit.  I have one of  these 
stroker 40hp that I put the big bore and big valve bus heads on. It is in  my 
61 single cab   and runs well  later Mark  Dearing
