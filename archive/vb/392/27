If you use a later bay relay you can add this feature with the adittion of a
constant hot wire.

It also looks like the non-US versions would let you flash the
headlights without the light switch having to be on, and that the
dimmer relay is then called a flasher and dimmer relay.  But it is
separate from the 9-prong blinkgeber.

I like the green shrink tubing!
