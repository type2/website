If the tires/redux boxes/torsion bars are up for the trip, I'd say go
for it.  I towed my bus from CO to MD on a dolly several years ago.
Other than losing the passenger side mirror somewhere between St.
Louis and Indianapolis, we didn't have any problems.  Later I heard
that dolly towing may damage the transmission due to the lack of
lubrication, so moving back to WA the bus was on a trailer.

Good Luck!
