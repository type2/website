  hi you all may know this already but i found a great way to fix the white westy plastic trim that curls up after sitting for years baking in the sun. preheat oven to 180 degrees, place trim on edge on a cookie sheet and bake for 5 or so minutes. hardened curls disappear everythings straight and reinstall while still warm and soft to prevent re-curling. also adds the length back that was taken away by the curling
