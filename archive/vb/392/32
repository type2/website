Subject: '66 Restoration

Hi, I'm brand new to the forum!

I finally take possession of the family '66 bus which was bought to collect
me from the hospital when I was born! 

Been dry stored a number of years, worked on a bit, have now put her in for
restoration. Does anyone have a schedule (detailed) of works to fully
restore a bus? Gotta little feeling the guy just might like to rip me off
-so want to keep one step ahead! Want to have written down as much as
possible and what to get for what amount of cash!!

For example, how long for a fully trained vintage bus restorer/mechanic to
fit a fuel tank to bus with engine already out?! Looks easy to me.

All help and advice much appreciated.
