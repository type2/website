Hey Uncle Jerry and crew
That looked like a whole lot of fun, wish I could have made it but, 
being about 2000 miles away I'm just a little out of range for a weekend 
there.  I like seeing pix of how bus folks around the world celebrate 
just being together, or their buses, or life in general where they come 
from.  So here's a challenge to all listees everywhere:

When you have an event, how about doing like Uncle Jerry did (THANK YOU 
UNCLE JERRY), and put up say 50 pix of your event for all of us to see.  
Might just get someone to say 'That looks like a fun bunch, I think I'll 
try and make it to (insert campout here) next year'.  Don't put up too 
many pix because it goes from enticing to slogging rather quickly.

Oh yeah - I'll be in AZ in February, anything happening then?
