I know there are fans but I personally would never run a 1641 the  cylinders 
are too thin and the extra cc's arent worth it to me. 



hey Sean   Well the bolt in 87mm P&Ls will last about 7  years,  the bolt in  
88s a little less as the walls are even thinner.  they do make thick wall 88s 
but you would have to machine the case and heads and  if you are doing that 
you moight as well go 90.5s The stroker 40hp with the 83mm  P&Ls is real close 
to 1500cc and they seem to last a long time. Of course  everything depends on 
the driver and conditions   later  Mark  Dearing
