Subject: Re: [VB] Engine Tin - for 1641 into a 60

It isn't the piston size that matters it's that the 40hp crank is only a 64mm and uses shorter rods so that's why 40hp tin isn't interchangable with 1300 and later tin. 
   
  You can use a 40hp case and drop a 69mm in without any case modifications but you'd have to use the later tin as far as i know. You can machine the 40 HP rods to fit on a 69mm crank and that would keep the 40hp tin the same. Other than a big bore 40hp kit or 77mm I think you have to bore the case for different p/c's.
   
  Think of it this way-ever try and fit a 40hp muffler on a 1300, 1600 or 1500?

  Hi John,
Somewhat depends on how you built the engine. With enough $$$ and madness 
you could build one out of a 25 or 36 HP engine case...
If you used a 40 HP bored for the larger cylinders, or 1300, or 1500, or 
1600 engine case. You can use the engine tin from each of the three latter 
sizes of engines, or a mixture of such. Though dog house shroud, fan, and tin 
are a must for 40 HP and later engines in our opinion.
