Subject: Re: J.P. in hospital

    I just got off the phone with JP!  He is at home after a 12 day stay at
the hospital!  He is still a little woozy from the medicines and kind of out
of it but it sounded like he was getting better and could possibly get well!
He said that he almost had a organ failure and is temporarily diabetic!  He
said that he will post up when he more mobile and feeling better!  he did say
thanks for the concern!
