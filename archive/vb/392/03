Hi Volks,
We assembled an interesting engine.  Found 40 HP Okrasa heads,  and 69 mm 
stoker crank.  Used big bore 40 HP 83 mm P&Cs.  Had  to shim under the cylinders, 
and lathe off some of the tops of the  pistons, to keep compression down.  
Thought that it would require a  1300-1600 muffler, but the stoker 40 HP one 
fitted on just fine.
  We are sure one could install a stroker 72 mm or larger crank and  after 
having the shorter 40 HP rods thinned on the crank ends to fit the later  crank 
it would all fit.  Then probably the 40 HP muffler would not  fit...
  Agreed the 1641cc engine will not be any quieter than a 40 HP one,  unless 
one was to completely balance and install a counter weight crank.   Even so to 
really bring down the highway noise, one would need to bring down the  RPMs.
