I had this happen once on a bug.  The float valve weeped fuel and one time
when the bug sat idle for a month or so the crankcase filled with gas.
When I restarted it it blew out the front seal and made a heck of a mess
on my driveway.

Another possiblity is a bad diaphragm in the fuel pump, but I think you
have already discounted that.
