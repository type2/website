Look through the archives for a vacuum operated valve from a motorcycle. 
Somebody wrote something up about a week or two ago on it. Simple & no 
electricity required.

My question would be is there any lag of the valve closing after the 
engine is shut off? I mean my brakes have 2-3 vacuum boosted pushes left 
in them after the engine is turned off.
