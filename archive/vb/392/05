Subject: Re: [VB] Engine Tin - for 1641 into a 60

Aren't the spacers like .100" or something like that? I plan on doing one of those engines as well but assumed that since the difference was much shorter than the 1/2 inch or so difference they are normally it wouldn't be that big of a deal. 
   
  I know there are fans but I personally would never run a 1641 the cylinders are too thin and the extra cc's arent worth it to me.

hey Sean  You will have to space the clylinders out from the case when doing this , This will cause a slight gap if you use the 40hp tin, which can be sealed. You will also have to spread the muffler to fit.  I have one of these stroker 40hp that I put the big bore and big valve bus heads on. It is in my 61 single cab   and runs well  later Mark Dearing
