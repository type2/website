I am almost ready to paint my 65 and I was wondering - has anybody done a 
two-tone with anything other than pearl white, cumulus white, blue white, or 
beige gray?

What about light ivory?  Pastel White?  

I wish I knew what the classic VW off white was that I always used to see 
when I was working as a VDub mechanic in the early seventies.  Mostly on 
dashbpards and interiors.  Maybee it WAS pearl white I dont know.
