Subject: Dave Brooks, Fuel Shutoff valve

Dear Dave, I'm getting forgertful.... it works like this: You start the car
and thereafter immediately you give a momentary supply of 12 V DC to the
valve, in order to open the solenoid inside.
I have a tiny tipp-switch mounted hidden away for this purpose.

The valve will stay open, even with the non-pressurized fuel flow from the
gravity supply in a VW Bus.
