OK, more flame bait.

Syncro Westies are in a special class just like 23 windows. Just  
compare a fully restored '63 23 vs. a '64 21 in price. I bet there is  
at least a 15k difference. Those prices have a marginal impact on  
other busses. A good example are the splits on eBay right now - a  
bunch of bids on a 21 window up to 25k so far, a 56 panel with og  
paint is pulling less than $1500. Obviously not restored, but also  
nowhere near 25k.

I could definitely see Jim Ellis in that 56 panel. Jim, just tell  
your family you need a few days off. Edmonton is only a a couple of  
hours North of Phoenix. :-)

I promise to wave to all Vanny drivers after I get the split back on  
the road. I'll even throw a wave to the Euros.
