Hi all,
   
  Looking at busses.  Most of the ones in my area seem to be around the mid-eastern states.  Does anyone know of a good company (or individual) that can transport a bus from Maryland area to the upper New York/Ontario border area (close to Kingston, Ontario)?  U-haul says my TDI is too small for their dollies.
  
Thanks,
   
  Jim.
