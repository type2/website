Hi Jon,
We thought it was earlier, but the official date for 1500 as  standard was 
01OCT64.  Since 1955 the model year started in AUG or  pretty close to that.  So 
OCT 64 would be the fourth month of the 1965  model year.  
  Still if your bus was built before that it could have been ordered  with 
the M215 and M216 Mcodes.
