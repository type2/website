Subject: Re: [VB] Push rod tube seals on an upright engine

To do it right, yes the heads will need to be removed. It is possible to 
replace seals without removing the heads using the spring loaded pushrod 
tubes. But I consider that method just a bandaid at best. They are great 
for a temporary fix to get you home from a road trip.
