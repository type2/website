The 1500 was available in Buses from the mid-1963 model year (January
1963 production) as an option.  M216 was the 1500 and M215 was the
one-ton suspension and 1500.  The 1500 didn't become standard until
the early 1965 models (September 1964 production).

The list consensus seems to be that the 1500 became standard for all
Buses imported to the US sometime before the early '65 models.  I've
never found any "official" documentation for this, but I think there
are original Buses, imported to the US, that had 1500 engines but
didn't have the M215 or M216 codes.  On the other hand, there are
some "mystery" M-codes in the M4xx range that might include the 1500
engine that many US buses of this era have.

VW didn't make a "van" until the early 1980s.  :)
