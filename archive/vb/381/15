I asked my students and they say you are correct!  :)

All this would be good, but I've never had any problem with checking the
float level the way stated in the manual.

1. Take the carb out
2. Support it so it is level (I clamp it gently in a vise by the studs,
using a cloth to protect the threads)
3. Attach a short length of fuel line to the inlet with a small funnel
attached.
4. Pour gas into the funnel until no more will go in.
5. Remove top of carburator
6. Measure liquid height with a small ruler.
7. Compare to spec.  If too high, use a thicker washer and repeat, if too
low, use a thinner washer and repeat.

I'd love it if the Solex had a glass window in the bowl like the Hitachi
carb on my Datsun 510, but the Solex was designed about 40 years earlier!
