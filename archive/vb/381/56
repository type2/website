Subject: Breather Box: What do you think?

I've posted this on a couple of forums, so if you;ve seen it sorry.  Just
wanted some opinions if you think it will work. Here's a Breather Box I made
for the Bus. It's heavy, since it's made of steel, but I think it will work
OK. What do you guys, and gals think?
