Subject: Arizona Bus Club Fiesta De Whetstone Dos - Who's going???

 

Howabout a show of hands for folks going to Whetstone next weekend? 

Phoenix caravan meets at Fry's Electronic's parking lot Friday March 31st
and leaves at 9am sharp..some of us far East Siders will meet up with you at
Arizona Avenue and Riggs. From there it's all farms down to Oracle Junction
where the dustys will head East and the smart people will head West through
Tucson but we'll all meet up at Michael's for Pollo Asado Friday night.

There's a thread on the samba with directions and "map" if you want to call
it that...  <http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?t=158716>
