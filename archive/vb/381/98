Subject: Barbeque at Sam's house after Red Barn/BYOB

 I talked to Clara today and she suggested a Barbeque at our house on the Saturday, April 8th,  before Kelley Park or the afternoon of BYOB. As BYOB seems to be petering out at around 2 PM I suggest congregating at :
10395 Bret Ave
Cupertino. CA 95014
 
I will run  2 Weber barbecues and will do ribs sausages, corn & beans
 
Please invite your splitty friends and give me a RSVP so I know how much stuff to get.
