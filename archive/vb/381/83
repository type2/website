To state the obvious - I think this is just a burp in the price of buses. 
At this time many people who buy and restore buses are in there 40's 50's 
and 60's - and have dough from a life time of working.  Once they age a bit 
I predict that the price will fall.  Now buses have a high nostalga factor 
for the 40 to 60 age group. I don't think people in there 20's and 30's 
today will be paying 20 or 30K for a bus in 10 or 20 years.

Without having done any research at all - I bet - the price of a desireable 
car - say a 57 chevy does not go for what it did a few years ago - that 40 
to 60 demographic has passed - or is passing by.
