Subject: Re: [VB] I give up.... Blinker light problems

hello Clark  telling how to solve electric problems over the net is very 
hard.  I do much better just getting in there and doing in person  :)  one thing 
that I have seen that is the best tool for electric problems is a Power Probe 
test lite.  This lite has 12 ft leads and enables you to introduce a postive 
and negative as you desire. Also has a built in negative jumper lead and a led 
lite pointed at the tip and a circuit breaker.  A little costly but one of the 
best tools I have evr bought. Got mine off the snap-on truck.  Later and have 
fun Mark Dearing
