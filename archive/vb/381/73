It's not hard for normal humans, either.

Use the key that works for the ignition

Remove the door handle

put the key into the lock

remove the phillips screw from the inside end of the cylinder

Make sure that there is a key in the lock!

pull the cylinder out.

Note which wafers are poking out of the cylinder.

Carefully remove the key from the cylinder over a clean cloth (to catch
wafers and springs that might fall.

Move the wafers around and try the key again until they are all flush with
the cylinder.

You will probably want to clean and regrease the cylinder while it is out

Reassemble.

Have fun!
