Subject: Hard top westy roof help

Hi Folks,
I am finishing up the interior of my '60 DD Panel turned camper.  I was 
lucky enough to locate the wooden bows for a pop top.  How are the roof 
panels situated up there?  The cab roof panels go flush to the end of 
the crosspiece over the bulk head.  Is this true in hard tops as well? 
or are they shorter and the cab pieces butt together with the large 
panel at the cross piece.  Am I clear?  Thanks
