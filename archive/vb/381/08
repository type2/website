The reason I thought you might have to machine something up is that the
float bowl plug/main jet holder doesn't have a tapered thread, like most
hose fittings you might find in the US.  It's just got straight threads
and a gasket under the head of the plug.  It might be easiest to drill a
hole in a spare plug and braze a little L-shaped brass tube into it,
then connect the clear tubing to the brass tube.

I would also suggest that the clear tubing needs to be rather taller
than the top of the float bowl; it needs to be open to the atmosphere
but it should stick up at least a couple of inches above the top of the
bowl, to help prevent accidental gas spills.

I'm not sure this is Pascal's Law, but I will wait for the official word
from a seasoned professional like George Lyle.  :)

It'd probably be good to wait until the engine was cool to swap the
regular plug back in, or pinch off the fuel line and run the engine
until it stalls from lack of fuel - this would mean that the bowl and
sight tube are *mostly* dry.
