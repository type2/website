Subject: Keying all locks to same key?  Safari's from Creative

Hello all,

  I was wondering if anybody has anyone good to recommend for working on my
locks for my 67?  I'm not really sure if all my cylinders will match up and
need the assistance of someone who can key them all the same?  For 67's
don't they all need to be from a single year?  

  Preferably someone closer to Hawaii, but doesn't have to be..   That's
actually impossible now that I think about it.

 

And, does anyone have any experience with the safaris from Creative
Engineering?  Leakers?  Quality?

  Any help is always appreciated.

Thanks. Aloha, J.D.
