Subject: Looking for Splitty

Hi all,
  
I'm looking for a splitty on the east side of the continent, the closer to eastern ontario the better.  Wife would prefer a 13 window.  Looking for something around $3000 that would'nt take too much to get back on the road.  Any leads would appreciated.
  
Thanks,
   
  Jim.
