Mark, you beat me to the same response. Unfortunately, Vanagon westys prices
have gone thru the roof lately.  Scuttle butt on the vanagon list this week
has been about a guy paying $73K for a totally redone syncro westy to the
volks at Go Westy.

The vanagon volks think split window drivers drive them cuz they can't
afford a vanagon! 

Whodathunk?
