Subject: Re: [VB] Push rod tube seals on an upright engine

Hi John,
Short answer, no.  Longer answer is that it can be done with the heads  on, 
BUT should only be done for an emergency.  Because it  requires folding the 
push rod tube and folding it back out.  BTDT....
  The aftermarket spring loaded tubes are not as good for cooling the  oil 
and should only be used for that quick fix to get it back on the  road.
  While you have the heads off it is a good time to retorque  ALL  the engine 
case studs.
