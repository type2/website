It may help (duh) to know the chassis number of our Panel: 215 005 505.
This would appear to be an early model.

There is no reason why I would beleive the engine is original, of course.
And, the M-Code plate is missing. So, my goal is to decide whether the 40

from Germany, which should help out (or even clear it up).

As Eric&Barb requested, I will get a picture of the intake to help our.

Thanks,

Jon
