My  much-maligned air cooled Vanagon Westy is a comfortable and   
relatively affordable vehicle - cost about the same as an old worn   
out Honda. Granted, it is not a sexy VW and I've had to put up with   
rude comments from other VW owners, but it works for my needs.  That's  
what I'm driving home tonight.



Hey Jim  I agree with him. except I will drive my waterboxxer home  tonight.  
After years of driving splitties I have found that the  waterboxxer vanagon 
westy is the best way to go,   Great seats, PS  steering , Ac , Great Heat, 
sleeps 4 , bought it for $2400 2 years ago and my  wife loves the room and 
comfort. It's funny but the older you get the wiser you  get  :)  later  mark Dearing
