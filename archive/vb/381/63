A sad ending to a VW family. I'm guessing there aren't any grandkids  
to pass along the heritage.

I paid $2800 for a "slightly better than so-so" condition '78 Westy  
about 7 years ago. An original owner bus in excellent condition with  
that milage should bring in the mid 6k range. But you never know what  
it might bring at the Scottsdale auction next year - 15-20k? With 5  
days left, you'll probably see another 3k added to that price.
