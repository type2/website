Subject: Re: [T2] Breather Box: What do you think?

Ought to work just fine. I have an aluminum EMPI breather box for my
Type powered Beetle and it is nothing more than an aluminum casting with
a piece of foam inside. Hoses run to both valve covers. The box drains
to the top of the engine case or into the oil filler cap if you like.
Can vent to the atmosphere or the air cleaner (my choice). The point is
to separate the oil and the air and yours ought to do that fine. Instead
of foam wouldn't vrass or stainless steel wool do just fine?

Wahoo! I have extended a storage shed here to make a Beetle Box (sort of
like BeetleShop.org)
