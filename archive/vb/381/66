Subject: M Plate?

Recently I inadvertently destroyed my M plate, in the engine bay,  with a corrosive that I was using to clean up some old nuts and bolts. I know, stupid move. Anyway, my question is is there any place to get a repro plate? Most all of the info is still legible and the thing is really just an overgrown dog tag. The plate behind the seat is also still there.

I thought there was something up when the nuts and bolts just sat in the Muratic acid and the M plate made it look like it was boiling, yikes.....
