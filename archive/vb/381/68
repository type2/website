Hi J.D.
Keying those locks is pretty easy for most lock smiths. I would call around
your area to see if anyone would be willing to do it. Most would prefer that
you bring in just the handles and they can re-key the tumblers. If you are
still having trouble finding someone you could mail them Boston Lock in
Grand Rapids, MI. They have done many, many bus locks for me and they charge
$15 each to re-key so they all match. 

Wishing you many miles of smiles!

Hello all,

  I was wondering if anybody has anyone good to recommend for working on my
locks for my 67?  I'm not really sure if all my cylinders will match up and
need the assistance of someone who can key them all the same?  For 67's
don't they all need to be from a single year?  

  Preferably someone closer to Hawaii, but doesn't have to be..   That's
actually impossible now that I think about it.

 

And, does anyone have any experience with the safaris from Creative
Engineering?  Leakers?  Quality?

  Any help is always appreciated.

Thanks. Aloha, J.D.
