Subject: IS EVERYONE INSANE- or what?

"Sorry" is my apologies stated up front.

I have been out of the air-cooled VW scene for a few years but still check
Everett Barnes' excellent website, http://thesamba.com aka VW Planet, like I
have OCD or something. Flatly stated, I am bitch-slapped bell runged amazed at
the prices that are asked for and coupled with the quality of and limits to the
inventory of vehicles and parts that are offered.

High dollar, incorrect Barrett-Jackson single cabs are a WHOLE 'nuther
conversation LOL ! (you GOTTA be sh***in' me!)

God bless you all. I simply can not any longer afford nor justify active
involvement in my former all consuming passion of air-cooled VWs. Still love
'em. But haven't seen anything -with a few rare exceptions- over the past 24 to
60 months- that would cause me to drive to a neighboring State/Provence to
obtain it. Sorry to sound like a sour-graped old F but I am most definitely
"out" in regards to time, energy, health and interest or the dinero to carry
on. In an ideal world I would still be all over it. In reality, I am simply
over it.

Thanks to you who continue to carry the (rusted over-priced) torch.
Good night and good luck...
