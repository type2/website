Hi Volks,

Are you planning on coming to Everybus next month? It's coming up on  
4 weeks away and I can hardly wait to get there. To keep myself  
entertained in the meanwhile I have set up  a Frappr map so that we  
can see where all the people and buses attending EveryBus come from.  
If you're attending, please visit the page and mark your place!

....And there's still time to help send a bus to camp by ordering a  
shirt from my buddy Adam:
