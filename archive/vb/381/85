Subject: Price Valuations

Looking at buses for sale I see that they are all across the board.  I'm
sure that everything is worth what someone is willing to pay for it.  Also
condition, location & type.  But are there guidelines and a price matrix
that gives a general idea what our very cool vintage precious vechicles are
worth????
