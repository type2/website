This is great information, and explains quite a bit, since early '65 and
later '65 (model year) makes a big(ish) difference.

I'll let folks know what the M-codes are once/if I get them. I submitted
credit card information a week ago to the museum, and have not yet been
charged. If that doesn't work, I'll fax them.
