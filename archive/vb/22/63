 This is a big weekend for me. As I posted earlier, I have cut a quarter
 panel out of a donor bus. Last night, a friend told me he had brought a
 plasma cutter home for me to use. So tomorrow morning, I am gonna try to
 remove the bashed in quarter panel. This will not be an easy job, but
 one that must be done.

Spot weld drill bit for precision removal?  measure twice, cut once.

 But I also ran into a problem. I cannot get the drivers door open,
 either from the inside, the outside or, with the window open, a
 combination of the two. Any one have this problem before and can offer
 me suggestions??

remove interior panel enough to spray lots of penetrating oil at/in the door 
mechanism.

while inside bus, lift inner handle to 'open' door, and bash door hard with 
left shoulder.   Repeat.   Cuss.  In several languages.  Have a beer. Put 
your jacket on.   Bash door with shoulder again.
