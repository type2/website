Geez, you really know what you are talking about!!!! Thanks, I found the
linkage rod behind the kick panel and yes I am running 12v and I'm not sure
but I don't think there is a drop. Unfortunately I had already ordered and
now received the linkage rod from Wolfsburg West. Now I have an extra!

BTW, can I put a pertronix ignitor in my vacuum advance 231 137 035
distributor? I ordered an ignitor for a vacuum advance dizzy but it is for a
later model and doesn't fit because there is a ridge about 2mm high around
the base of the shaft. The technician at Pertronix told me they don't have a
kit for my distributor.

Thanks again,

 I need a connecting rod for the windshield wiper apparatus for the

 one? >>

did you find it?  they are easy to pop into place, sometimes they fall off
and are down under that area.  Do you have a voltage drop if youare 12V?
without that drop they can go too fast and that pops the linkage apart
