Yep, the 2nd dome light is above the rear window, and is triggered by
the toggle switch on the left side of the speedo pod.  I was just at a
VW show in NE Maryland yesterday that had 2 doublecabs, and neither of
them had the 2nd dome light.  The owners didn't realize this because the
POs had also rewired the toggle switch position for other things--like
switching an aux. heater fan in the heater duct.  The dome light is the
same assembly as the other one mounted overhead.

The rear seat ashtray is mounted on the drivers side of the seat divider
bulkhead.  Its chromed and slides into a chrome base.  Its the same kind
that you would see on passenger buses.  I have a '67; don't know if they
were on all years or not.
