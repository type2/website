Kelly,
I hope you're doing well, brother. I enjoyed reading the recollection of 
your father. Keep the fire strong.

I'm in the Air Force. I am really concerned about how this thing will play 
out, too. Last night, I had a young man and his mother ask me if we're gonna 
"go to war?" and "how I felt about it?". I told them that when I chose to 
put on this uniform, and what it represents, I chose to make that sacrifice 
to protect our way of life. (Keyword:"OUR") If war is what is decided, so be 
it. I am not looking forward to what comes next, but, I am ready. I work for 
the best trained, best equipped, and prepared military in the world... we 
are trained to take on these tasks. That's our vigil.
I am not a "warmonger", and yes, I love my v-dub (that's for you, 
Craig)(smirk). However, if deciding between the death of 20-30,000 (not sure 
of how accurate any death tolls are, right now) innocent civillians or me... 
I choose me.
Wish us all luck and Godspeed.
J Ruck

PS. Thanks for all the awesome welding info!
