Don't waste your time Scott. He profiled you, saw your plate didn't come 
back, and thought he had an easy ticket. The "too loud" thing was something 
he just thought up. Next time easiest just to humor him with the "yes sirs" 
and let him come back to you quicker with "I'm gonna let you off this 
time". If you'd had window tint on your truck, he probably would have just 
said that "your tint is too dark". They basically are just checking you 
out. That's how the bust people most of the time. But they have to have 
probable cause....real or not. Not fair, right, or just. But it is the way 
it is...and don't expect changes anytime soon.
