Subject: re:[VB] Optima Batteries - a downside...

I refuse to give Optima another dollar! Check the
archives under my name and optima for prior
discussions. Root issue is the expensive outlay for
"the best" for the then new resto 67Westy. Fast fwd a
few years to me standing at the counter of the same
retail vendor being told that there was a $75. core
prorate fee for another 'spensive battery. Switch
channels to be standing in line at WalMart purchasing
a  72Month no questions asked battery for about $40.
End of subject.
