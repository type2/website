 Geez, you really know what you are talking about!!!! Thanks, I found the
 linkage rod behind the kick panel and yes I am running 12v and I'm not sure
 but I don't think there is a drop. Unfortunately I had already ordered and
 now received the linkage rod from Wolfsburg West. Now I have an extra!
 ----------------
an extra is cool.   At least it is small.  The wiper motor gets going fast 
when run on 12V and kicks the rod.  Especially when it gets to winding the 
motor out.  eventually it'll fry.  Find a voltage drop and wire it in at the 
power to the wiper switch.  Alvailable at yours FLAPS or VW FLAPS.  Or put in 
JP's concept- the switch that gives you 3 speed wipers when running a 6V 
motor on 12V, sorry dont have the info nearby on that one.

 BTW, can I put a pertronix ignitor in my vacuum advance 231 137 035
 distributor? I ordered an ignitor for a vacuum advance dizzy but it is for a
 later model and doesn't fit because there is a ridge about 2mm high around
 the base of the shaft. The technician at Pertronix told me they don't have a
 kit for my distributor.
  ..................

I have no clue on that one.  never ran a Pertronix.  Seems like something 
else to break.   I just keep it simple with the points.  Some people like 
them, though.  Maybe someone else knows what would fit yours ?
