Subject: Dual Carb 1776 finally figured out

So I have not posted in forever. We have been incredibly busy and my 60
Double Cab has been getting neglected. Anyway you may remember that I
was having a heck of a time getting my new 1776 working right. #4
cylinder kept dropping out on me. I kept messing with the carbs. (I
could just here all of the purists out there thinking damn dual carbs.)
What would happen is #4 would stop firing, I would clean out the carb
and it would run good for about a week. After about a year and a half of
this I got the carbs hot tanked and rebuilt. It ran good for about 3
months and then #4 went dead again. So what could I have been doing that
was changing things? I finally figured out that everytime I pulled that
carb I wiped off and cleaned the spark plugs. I am 99% sure that my oil
rings on that cylinder are leaking and fouling the plug. It was wet and
oily when I pulled it this time. The reason I got the 3 months of good
running was I just replaced the spark plugs with new ones. This meant
they were even cleaner than the ones that had been wiped down. Anyway I
hope this helps someone out there. Try to keep an open mind when trouble
shooting and don't get too attached to one idea. I should have noticed
the wet plugs a long time ago but I was far to sure it was the carb. Now
I just hope the guy who built my motor will stand behind it even though
it is almost two years old.
hope this helps,
