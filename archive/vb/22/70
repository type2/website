Subject: Excess oil pressure

I have recently noticed that Rosie's oil pressure is way too high (above 80
psi) at highway speeds. I suspect that one or both of the pressure relief
pistons are stuck. I could use some coaching on removing and checking them
out. All suggestions welcome.

Thanks

Craig
