Subject: Re: [VB] undercover cops at jerome

well, it appears as if the story is rumor probably not based on fact.  i doubt that don would shut the event down because of cops... i mean we wouldn't bring them with us so shouldn't get "punished" in such a harsh way.  i love the jerome campout, i love the location, the people and the buses (even the ugly late models)... and don is great too but i don't think he should jump his vintage motorcycle through the double doors of any more buses.  that was a little too scary!  anyway, i'll see a lot of you there!

> As far as undercover cops at jerome I think it is more or less a scare tactic.  The owner of the mine hates cops more than anyone.  If he finds out there are undercover cops there he may shut this event down on the spot or at the very least never let us return.  I know the owner of the mine and his employees for years now.  I wouldn't sweat it.
