Subject: RE: [VB] Yakima Apple Valley VW Meet

It's this Sunday... All I can remember is you take the East most exit in
Yakima, go south on what ever road runs from the main drag out to the
freeway. turn left again and then turn right at the road which has a car
wash on the south east corner.  go south (or what ever direction that is...)
until you see the park with a bunch of VWs in it.

Correct me someone if I'm wrong or give some BETTER directions. :-)

If no one responds with more specifics, I'll go home at noon (pdt) and get
the flyer and relay the better info.
