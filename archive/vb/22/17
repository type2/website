Steve--

These were actually #12 sheet metal screws with hexhead tops so I could
tighten them down (from underneath) with a mini socket wrench.  They
held quite well in this wood.  By pre-drilling, I meant that I drilled
smaller-diameter guide holes into the undersides of the slats, to
prevent splitting the wood with the screws.  Hope that clears things up
for you.

BTW Randy's VW Parts on the left coast has (or had) a good deal for the
doublecab repros, around $125 (early last year) plus shipping, without
hardware.  As opposed to another fellow who occassionally offers a set
at that popular Internet auction site for over $300 (with hardware).
