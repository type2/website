Subject: Any sundial winners?

Does anyone know of a sundial camper ever winning best of show or best in 
class or any awards for that matter?  If not what limits them?  Are there 
not any nice ones out there or is it just that the westy is nicer(even 
though I am a sundial advocate, westies are much nicer-sorry Chuck)?
