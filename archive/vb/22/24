All:

It would appear that the Jerome meet may not be ... which is too bad as 
it could be an opportunity to fulfill Ronnie's suggestion on banning 
together to provide assistance.  For example: The Red Cross could be 
contacted and the Jerome Jamboree used as a blood donation drive.

For that matter, there is no reason why local VW groups/chapters cannot 
assemble kombis/Westies/Ambulances/etc. to provide transportaiton to and 
from blood clinics in your respective areas.

... Though I didn't take Ras Bulli Split (as he's not currently on the 
road), I did take a carload an hour away last evening for the purpose of 
giving blood and being good neighbours.

Bugs & Things and Splits...Oh, my!

Roy
