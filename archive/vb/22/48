Subject: Re: [VB] Our turn to help

I suppose you are right. Shouldn't have been as sharp, but my kindler
gentler side is at the cleaners right now. Some of us have put a ton of time
and effort into the bus and the event, and current events are less than
desireable. My phone hasn't stopped ringing in the last three days from
people calling to ask if it is still on. There has never been a thought of
cancelling it, so your message caught me wrong. Not your fault, so I promise
I won't be as jumpy for at least the next three days.
