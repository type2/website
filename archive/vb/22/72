This is a common method of making sure that few items are returned for
warranty replacement.  Don't be surprised if your battery somehow gets
"lost" or there is a "paperwork SNAFU" in the process as well.  Make sure
that there is a paper trail (such as tracking numbers) in the shipping
process so you can be sure that they received the goods.

Optima batteries are nifty, but I much prefer a conventional battery in a
good plastic battery box as long as I'm not subjecting the battery to
excessive shaking or G-load. No corrosion problems and Pep Boys sells 'em
for $40 with a 6-year warranty.  No hassle with returns either.  If one
doesn't work, the new one is pro-rated for the remaining warranty of the
old battery on the spot.  They'll even pro-rate it by reading the date
code on the battery if I don't have the receipt.
