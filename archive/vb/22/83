Have you tried EBay?  I just bought one for the Cargo door off of there for
$9.99.  I've seen some listed.  Now if I can find the Big one for the rear
hatch door.

I know it's a long shot, but I'm looking for some Westy curtain rods. Even
"late" ones will do. I need ones for the doors, but if a long front one is
out there I can cut it down as well.

Thanks,
Greg
