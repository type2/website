Subject: '68 - '79 Hatch Bikes Racks now in Stock

The shipment of Fiamma T1 racks for '68 - '79 Bus are now in stock.

You can call to order or purchase through the website.  I cannot offer any 
discounts on these as the production was limited and costs were very high.  I 
hope to be able to continue to offer these in the future but it all depends 
on how many we can sell.

The fit and finish on these is excellent.  They come equipped to hold 2 bikes.

I will be working with Fiamma to develop a bracket to work with earlier 
buses.  I'll try to keep you posted on our progress.

Thanks,
