Subject: Re: [VB] Our turn to help

My apologies ...  I had misread a prior message in the thread ... also 
why I did not make an absolute statement in my posting.

Correcting my statement if fine, and I appreciate that.  However, a 
little civility and decorum in the process of delivery would better 
serve your message.

Merci, quand même / Thank-you, just the same.

Roy
