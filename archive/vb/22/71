Subject: Optima Batteries - a downside...


As you know, I run Optima batteries in my 911 and
in my VW bus, and have been for a while.  The battery
in the 911 didn't want to crank the engine over after
sitting for a month and a half, and didn't want to 
take a charge.  Interstate requires you to send the
battery back to them for evaluation, and if they 
deem you battery to in fact be bad, then they'll 
make good on the warranty, otherwise I guess they just
send your battery back to you.  Unfortunatley it's more
than a week's turnaround, which I find unacceptable.
If you only have one car, you're screwed!  I run 
the identical battery in the bus and 911, so I pulled
the battery out of the bus to power the 911 while mine
is out for 'evaluation.'

When the shop that sold me the battery told me of this
policy, I thought I smelled b*llsh*t, but I got the
info corroborated with a second shop.
