In addition to what has already been mentioned, there are also:

1.  Doublecab-sized wood bedslats (if you're going for the original
look)
2.  3 interior trim panels for the backseat area
3.  Some of the masonite headliner pieces may be unique to the DC
4.  Hold-down brackets, bolts, and wing nuts for the rear seat base
5.  You should have 2 dome lights (sometimes one is missing), and an
ashtray in the back seat area.
