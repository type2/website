Subject: Attaching bed slats with screws

This does sound like a good idea and I might suggest something that may
work even better.  Around the rural areas, we are building large metal
barns that have a wooden frame.  In order to attach the metal to the frame
we use a hex headed metal screw that has a drill bit tip and on it's head a
rubber washer.  Using a cordless screw driver, we drive this into the sheet
metal and they drill their own hole through the metal and into the wood.
The rubber washer seals the screw (there is a shoulder on the screw head
that acts as a washer) against the sheet metal.  These screws do have a
powder coating on them so they won't rust.

You can find these screws with the self drilling tip and rubber sealing
washer at most well stocked lumber yards.
