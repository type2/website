Subject: Friday long events this week venting 


The song you are referring to Is Coward of The County by Kenny Rogers.
I missed all the wars due to my age. My father however didn't. My sisters
nor i knew till after his death that he actually pulled one full stint and
part of another one, during the second stint he was wounded by and 88 shell
of the Germans. He had shrapnel in most of his body from it , plus lost a
1/3 of his stomach due to it, broken leg hand and more. He had a piece of
shrapnel in his shoulder that couldn't be removed and was there when he
died, During the years i was growing up i saw mom pinch what she thought was
blackheads on his face and shoulders, many times  what would emerge was tiny
shrapnel pieces that had worked thier way up to the surface over the years.
Dad recieved a Purple Heart for his part in WW II. At his death being the
only son , i recieved the flag from his casket, and the shells from the
military salute, also at that time my sisters opted to give me his Purple
Heart as well. All  these things are put away safely, as my most cherised
things to rember him by.
war and fighting is a bitch and effects generations of people afterward.
No matter how you look at it there is no good or civil  way to conduct it.
There's really no point to this post, all the event's this week and the
pressure of things going on in my life rite now have just affected me in a
way i'm unacustomed to and i needed to vent.
Also i would like to thank all who contacted me and wished me well in the
surgery. It was deeply appreciated. later
