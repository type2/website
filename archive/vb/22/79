Subject: Re: [VB] Double Cab Bed Floors, and Double Cab parts Help.

First, what year?  Older is harder to find like anything else.
============

HTF or Expensive:

Correct bed corrugated metal...corners too.

Rear window on earlier (pre 64) DC's.  Same as BD and early single cabs.
Can be tough to find if you want OG.

Rear seat, pedestal, mat and some years of rear side window latches.

Gates in straight condition are good.

Pre 62 tail lights like on anything else.

Most everything else is standard bus of that year stuff.  There might be
some other stuff I'm forgetting.  Anyone?
