Subject: Double Cab Bed Floors, and Double Cab parts Help.

I might be able to get a toasted Double cab in some horse, er VW trading,
but it has NO bed.  All of the supports are there, but the top is gone.
Does anyone make a panel for this?

Also what other Double Cab only parts should it have?

Thanks
Charles
