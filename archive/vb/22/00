Subject: Re: [VB] Delta alert

  I am at the Air Force base in Anchorage,It was 5am our time when this all 
started and I would have to say the F-15s were up in about 15 minutes 
patrolling our coastline .Of course we are under a pretty heavy lock down 
here also.It makes it kinda scary here considering we have the major oil 
pipelines running through alot of the state.We are down to FP CON charlie 
today but dont see it dropping below that for some time.
