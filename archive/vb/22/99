this is all so very hhorible i cant even imagen.
for those that dont know the prophecies of nostradamus, he predicted that "in 
the ninth month of the new millenium the twin brothers york will fall"
spooky.
i want to thank nick, another bus head, who comforted me through all this, 
and also to all those who have comforted the thousands out there who were hit 
hard by this...whether they knew anyone who died or not. we love you all.
