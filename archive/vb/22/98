(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-) Well, That is darn cool I must say.I
wish you all well Bro....It is going to be a long
fight.I am going to check into the laws here in Calif
to carry a concealed handgun.I have a very clean
background. I have worked for the city here and had to
clear the police background check and I have worked in
construction on a school site and had to clear that
background check to work.It is time to arm
ourselfs.Next time a terrorist trys to take a hostage
anywhere they should look like a slice of swiss cheese
before they hit the floor.... done in by many armed
Americans in the same room.            The bus content
here is I looked at a 69 Westy today...wrong list here
and not my cup of tea.It's red and has seen much
better days.But it can be had for under 500
bucks....If I had to guess a price.The dude wants to
get it sold.It has a rebuilt 16?? in it...some 10,000
miles ago with parts missing and or broken and a large
family of spiders.The front axle is busted
and.....well you get the point.It is not clean by any
means but it is a start for someone I guess.I have his
email and phone number if you are serious...He is a
local here in San Luis Obispo,Calif.               
This old world will never be the same from here on
out.Gear up and get some training...No one in this
world can do this to us and think we will all be sheep
waiting for when they choose to kill us.      I for
one will...if I go down at the hands of a
terrorist....It will be with my gun and a empty
clip... not just laying on the floor face down waiting
for them to shoot me and mine in the back of our
heads.(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)
