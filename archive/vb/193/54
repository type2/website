From the description I read the bus appears to be a "5-50". You know,
looks good after 5 beers from about
50 feet!

I'm not a big fan of Bondo Busses like I see around all the time so I
prefer painted dents.
Its the six thousand dollar pretty busses that sell for $6000.00 that
everybody wants for $999.95.
I must agree though it does look better from around 70 feet at night.
