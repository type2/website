You are probably right, a natural ground for the battery.

actually, batteries used to go dead when you put them on a concrete
floor because the cases were made of pressed rubber or some other
non-perfect insulator - and they would 'leak' to ground when placed
on concrete (maybe because the concrete held moisture?).
this was looooong ago.
modern plastic cases don't have this prob, but like george said, the
acid fumes will eventually etch the concrete.
