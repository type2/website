I use a Chevy Pitman arm puller with a spacer I made from angle iron.  It
pulls tie rods, ball joints, and pitman arms.  It has a hefty fine thread
bolt with a centering point.  if the rod end doesn't have a centering hole
I use a small nut to save the point.

For stubborn tapered fittings I put the puller on, tighten it, and then
flex the pitman arm or swing lever by putting a small sledge hammer on one
side of the boss and whacking the other side with a ball-peen hammer.

If this fails, it's Blue Wrench time!
