Subject: Mirror bracket?

I need just the hinge pin/mounting rod for a right-side elephant ear
mirror for my '66 bus. The mirror is OK, but the rod got broken (at the
top, where there's a threaded hole for mounting the mirror).  Does
anyone sell just this rod? All I can find advertised is the entire
rod/mirror assembly.
