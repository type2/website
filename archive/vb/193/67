Subject: Re: [VB] Freeway flyer pricing question?

Weddle quoted me roughly the same ($900) and warned that he was picky 
on cores... so that and freight could have been $1200!!
now, i think weddle has a great rep, and would be willing to pay it 
- IF i had the dosh! - but you might find that pulling 2 trannys from 
others that crap out before you get a good one worth the savings :) 
check the archives; there are numerous threads on different rebuilds 
and any whines, popouts, etcetc.
