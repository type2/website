Subject: Re: [VB] 6 volt batteries

or Wal-Mart for that matter..... I've got a heavy duty Wal-Mart for $59.95
in my truck and a regular one $45.99 Wal-Mart special in my Bus.... A few
days ago when temps drop down to almost zero the only thing that started
right up was my truck and my Bus... even my 4 year old Quattro needed a
jump..

I don't think you need Optima in a Bus...

just my 2 cents worth,
