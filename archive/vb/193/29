Subject: re:Camper Floor

I have an EZ-CAmper, which is supposed to be very similar to the Sundial.
The original vinyl floor in my bus was laminated to some masonite. I would
recommend if you go this route-i reccommend sealing the surface of the
masonite(1/8" i think), otherwise any water that gets under it will slowly
rot it out. This is what happened to my original floor, and my first
replacement.

The flooring orginally went under all the old cabinets os it goes down
first...if it didn't a gap would show there, and collect a lot of dirt/dust,
possible water intrusion point.

It did not originally cover the entire area-although when i replaced mine-i
had it replace everything. that way I protect the metal.

good luck.
