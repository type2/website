actually, batteries used to go dead when you put them on a concrete 
floor because the cases were made of pressed rubber or some other 
non-perfect insulator - and they would 'leak' to ground when placed 
on concrete (maybe because the concrete held moisture?).
this was looooong ago.
modern plastic cases don't have this prob, but like george said, the 
acid fumes will eventually etch the concrete.
