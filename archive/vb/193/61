Subject: RE: [VB] JCWhitney tie rod removal tool - not worth the money

I thought I had read that somewhere. It was a while
ago but I thought it was because of the chrome itself.
It was not a good material to use because it held in
heat more than a painted surface would. And though the
tin only guides air around the cylindars, it still
gets hot. I'll take a look and see if I can find it.
It might have been in that "How to Hot Rod " book. 
 There was an article done a few years ago(?) that
discussed the aftermarket tin and how it was garbage.
It's usually thinner, not engineered correctly, and as
you said missing crutial deflectors. This can be said
especially for fan shrouds! Though they do clean up
easier than a painted surface. ;)
