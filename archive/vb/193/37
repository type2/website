I can't believe that I got sucked in again!!!  Maybe cuz I really wanted to
see one of my tilts on the silver screen?  In any event, I have a big color
poster w/ the flaming 59 DC w/ tilt on my bus  wall of fame & I'm gonna
pretend that George didn't burst my naive bubble!

Thanks for the memories Todd.  You have raised the stakes for Everett in
recreating the bigfoot, I mean the vintage bus!
