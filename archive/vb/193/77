Subject: Re: [T2] Front nose tire cover ??

They are only $15.00 bucks at the BD--

No big denaro's-----at least it will last a bit longer than some worn
out, tired, old, bug banged, rocked chipped, elastic stretched fagged
out cover---

A much nicer Xmas gift--branny new.

A very good friend of mine that has had a run of bad luck--But finally
after 2 years she has her bus back on the road after a bad accident--
She is in need of the tire cover for the spare on the front of her
bus--A used one will be fine--as she will decorate it to match her bus--
If anyone can help please P-mail me--hopefully for a Christmas gift--?
