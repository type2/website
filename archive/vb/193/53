While I agree with the sentiment, the chrome isn't what will hurt you with
tin.  The tin simply ducts air around and doesn't have a significant role
in dissipating heat.  The vast majority of the heat is dissipated through
forced convection and leaves with the air out the bottom of the engine.

What _will_ hurt you is the low quality of some of the aftermarket tin,
whether it is chrome or black.  A while back I bought a set of cylinder
tins and then wondered why my cooling flaps didn't move.  turns out that
they didn't bother to put in the "dimples" needed to clear the actuating
levers as they moved.  they also tend to leave out some of the small, but
important air guides inside the tin.

For a long time, my rule has been to use only OEM tin, preferably German.
I'd rather spend a few hours cleaning and brazing to make sure that I
have tin made as Ferdinand intended.
