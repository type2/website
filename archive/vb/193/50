Subject: Freeway flyer pricing question?

From the list I was recommended to Rancho and Long as good sources. Checked with Rancho and quoted $475 plus $95 for a core charge. Long quoted me today at $895 plus $200 fo a core charge. Any difference in quality or rebuild work between the two. Since I have to convert Cdn$$$ to US, this is an important consideration. I am also not afraid to pay the extra $$ for quality..... do it once and do it right when it comes to VW mechanicals.

What say the experts?
