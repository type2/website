In Alaska we ran Mobile 1 in everything, winter and summer. It was the only
synthetic you could get in 76.

i actually had it suggested to me to try synthetic oil in the winter for its
cold weather properties. i haven't tried it yet, but i think i will soon,
maybe this weekend. thanks for the explanation-basically it is the liquid
inthe battery being too thick. now that i think of it, why doesn't the
liquid inthe battery freez. i mean it is mostly water isn't it? i always top
it off with water(distilled right).
