I've also heard of premature failures and slow warranty adjustments
including Optima insisting that the failed battery be returned for
"inspection" before an adjustment was authorized.  Unless you really
_need_ the sealed technology, you're better off buying a Pep Boys battery
for 1/3 the price and putting it in a battery box.
