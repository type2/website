I just had an SUV turn into the side of my '67 VW bus. Now I'm in
    search of a pair of side cargo doors. Is there anyone out there that
    can help me locate them?  Mark Meara    407-323-1765

Contact Keith Sturgeon at All Foreign Auto Wrecking, Fort Worth Texas, I
don't have the phone but they are on Elliott Reeder Road.
They have a set of very nice doors.
