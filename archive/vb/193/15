Subject: [VB] Check out the front seat area on this bus... 

In a past life, I had been known as pretty much of a vintage guy. I salute this
'62 panel effort as well as the DDPanelBarndoorDeluxeSunroof that John Jones <
GOBUGGIN(-at-)aol.com > has for sale. Innovation, craftsmanship and creativity are
good for humanity and the VW community.

Dump an aircooled 911 in that 62 panel, paint it a combination of 1967 Chevy
SS396 Chevelle/'Camino/Corvette metalic skyblue tastefully mixed with that over
used hotrod "1999 color of the year" golden bronze with minimal blended touches
of light purple and let her rip! =) Continued good luck to both efforts.

Peace on Earth and bagged buses in the dirt!
