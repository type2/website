Subject: RE: [VB] JCWhitney tie rod removal tool - not worth the money

I am in the UK and I use a tool similar to this one:

Pretty sure I saw a similar tool in Sears when I was in Indiana a couple of
months back.

I even managed to get the drag link of earlier today without removing the
pitman arm.
