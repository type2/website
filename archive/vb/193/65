As Jerry said the Feb. 2003 VW Trends Mag. has great pix and story of Jerome!
On pg. 96 is a nice picture of VWHoward's former Zebra Bus, on the verge of
"rustoration", er, "restoration"!  No this is not his bus with the cheby V8!
  Way to go, you made in the mags again John,
    THUMBS UP! (ouch!),
