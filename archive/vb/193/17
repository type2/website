Subject: RE: [VB] 6 volt batteries

  I have had the same wally world battery in my DD for 4 years and it has
never failed. Tha's all I use and at 29.95 to 32.95 exchange you can't go
wrong. Wally World here also has/had optima batteries. I don't get the
dedicated VW one, don't need to pay 10 dollars more for a red plastic
positive terminal protector

or Wal-Mart for that matter..... I've got a heavy duty Wal-Mart for $59.95
in my truck and a regular one $45.99 Wal-Mart special in my Bus.... A few
days ago when temps drop down to almost zero the only thing that started
right up was my truck and my Bus... even my 4 year old Quattro needed a
jump..
:-)

I don't think you need Optima in a Bus...

just my 2 cents worth,
