Subject: RE: [VB] JCWhitney tie rod removal tool - not worth the money

The one from Buam tools is listed as a 266h, similiar but not quite exactly
like the half circle 266h VW made back then. I have both, and they both work
wonderfully, almost exactly the same. I have a notion that the Pelican part
is very similar.
I beleive its around 35 from Baum. You can't get the drag link off without
pulling the pitman first stil, since the tool interferes with the chassis,
but it's a SNAP on tie rod ends. Made me forget the pickle fork at the
drawer bottom.

someone posted this link to the list a while back. has anyone tried this one
out yet?
