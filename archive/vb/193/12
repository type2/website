Subject: Looking for fire gear

I am looking for all types of literature, websites, etc for info on the fire 
buses, primarily late 50's to early 60's, but all years would be acceptable 
as well.  I would also like to buy merchandise that is fire specific.  Any 
help would be grealty appreciated.  I don't need OEM, or original parts only 
either.  All products of like would be acceptable as well.
Rick
