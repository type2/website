Subject: RE: [VB] batteries and cold

Batteries, and much else besides superconductors, don't work well when cold
because chemical reactions are slowed way down. That's what makes storing your
dry cells in the freezer great. The natural chemical reactions inside the
battery are slowed way down extending it's shelf life. Of course you have to
let them warm back up to become useful again.

i never understood the science behind this, could someone explain it to me.
i know batteries don't work as well when cold, but why?

I thought that heat causes resistance in wires-so shouldn't cold reduce
resistance(ie superconductors, which I believe are super chilled) and
therefore a cold battery working on cold wires should work better?

where is the mistake in my logic?

thanks for clearing this up for me.
