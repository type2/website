I've NEVER seen anything from JCWhipme that I would
buy sight unseen, and I'm embarrassed to say that I
have purchased a few things from Harbor Freight since
they opened a store in Albuquerque, but only upon
personal inspection, and still was upset at my
purchases about half the time.

Why aren't people willing to spend the money for REAL
tools???

PS Got my tie-rod end puller from
hazetguy(-at-)earthlink.net for a substantial amount, but
it hasn't failed me yet.
