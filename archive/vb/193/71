If you've got over 10 K on your engine there isn't any reason why you
shouldn't but I'd suggest that you run some Gunk / Siloo / Rislone Engine
Flush through to clean the crankcase of varnish and sludge.
If you don't clean it the synthetic oil will and you'd rather have that
sludge in a waster barrel than in your engine.

The procedure for cleaning your engine is at this site.
