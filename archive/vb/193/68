Subject: batteries and cold

i never understood the science behind this, could someone explain it to me.
i know batteries don't work as well when cold, but why?

I thought that heat causes resistance in wires-so shouldn't cold reduce
resistance(ie superconductors, which I believe are super chilled) and
therefore a cold battery working on cold wires should work better?

where is the mistake in my logic?

thanks for clearing this up for me.
