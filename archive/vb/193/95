Cool thanks for the replies.  What do I do with the accelerator push rod
rubber?  Does that stay in a fixed position on the rod or does that stay
connected to the floor?  This is a WCM one.  My bus has had welding around
this area so my hole may be the wrong size though - will have to try and get
a measurement off another one.
