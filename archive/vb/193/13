Hiya list,
Getting ready to redo the floor in my Sundial.  I'm currently rebuilding the
entire interior, and I have a coupla floor questions:

What material is used under the vinyl flooring?  Is it plywood, or masonite,
or something else?  What is the thickness used?

Does the flooring butt up to the cabinetry that fits under the zbed?  Or
does the flooring go underneath that cross-piece?

Does the floor go down first, then the jumpseat behind the driver, (I have a
walk-thru Sundial)?
Does the icebox go on top of the floor, or does the floor butt up to the
edges of the icebox?

As always, thanks for your help and guidance.
