If this is true, then you have a "stock" '60 spindle on one side, and a "63" spindle
on the other. The "63" spindle uses the earlier link pins, but the later brakes.

I use these alot on the early Buses I do. Better / cheaper brakes that way.

If you can find another '63 spindle and upgrade the brakes on that side as well.
Wolfgangs would be a good source for them.
