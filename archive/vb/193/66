Subject: Re: [VB] Freeway flyer pricing question?

$895 is a huge amount of money for a rebuilt transmission! For that much 
I would expect it to install itself. I just got a Rancho freeway flier 
from Ronnie a couple of months ago. I like it even better now than I did 
when I first installed it. It shifts better and runs quieter than any 
other bus tranny I've ever had, and I've had a few. I'm happy with my 
Rancho and the deal I got from Ronnie.

Don't forget to replace all the bushings in the linkage too.

>>From the list I was recommended to Rancho and Long as good sources. Checked with Rancho and quoted $475 plus $95 for a core charge. Long quoted me today at $895 plus $200 fo a core charge. Any difference in quality or rebuild work between the two. Since I have to convert Cdn$$$ to US, this is an important consideration. I am also not afraid to pay the extra $$ for quality..... do it once and do it right when it comes to VW mechanicals.
