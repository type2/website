I bought a new 6 V battery three months ago from the local Interstate
distributor.  They sell a "Group 2" 6 V battery that is bigger and
closer to the original VW spec than the 6 V batteries I see at the auto
parts stores.

When I bought the new battery I went out to install it in the parking
lot.  Something told me to test it out before I lifted it up into the
Bus.  I put my voltmeter on it and it was 4.something volts.  I took
it right back in and the guy checked it with his meter and got the
same result, and gave me another battery that measured 6.3 volts.
That one has been fine so far.  The point is, 6 V batteries don't
fly off the shelf, so check yours before installing, even if it's
brand new.
