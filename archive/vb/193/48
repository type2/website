Awe c'mon George, I store all my dry cells in the freezer until needed because
the cold slows down the chemical break down. I stick the motorcycle batteries
in the garage refrigerator after a full charge to slow down plate
degeneration. Best of all world is a full charge and drain the acid, but that
is tough stuff to dispose of with all the regs around here!

Batteries sitting on concrete go dead faster because they are colder.  No
0ther reason.

The real reason for not putting batteries on the concrete floor is that
every battery will eventually leak, and acid etches concrete.
