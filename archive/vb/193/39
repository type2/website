Conrad, I never had any problem with the tie rod removal tool. I bought it and
all four tie rod ends for my 67 (which were labeled VW?AUDI) and the removal
tool work great on the tie rods and the drag link. I guess it's all relative,
mine weren't frozen solid into the joints, maybe yours were.

Hi,

Just for the record, this tool is worthless in my opinion. It cost $9 +
$9 shipping (rip) and does not do the job. It is hard to keep mounted
on the joint/union area. The bolt that is used to push out the tie rod
bolt, spins off when tightened (it should be bigger with a recessed end
or have a welded on flat cap to increase surface area). This is one of
those tools that seems "fashioned" after an original tool - but not
produced by a tools company.

I have successfully used a pickle fork - but I was hoping for something
a little less destructive.

Conrad
