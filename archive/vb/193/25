Subject: WACKY FRONT END!

Hey all,

	I'm working on the bus and I found out some wacky stuff!

	The front end has different year spindles!!  The bus is a '60 and the the
drivers side somehow has a later ('64-67) spindle/brake set up?

	Is this possible?
	Am I dreaming?
	Any reccomendation?
	Should I upgrade the passenger side?
	Should I downgrade the wacked side?

	Any advice is greatly appreciated.

THANKS

-Roger
