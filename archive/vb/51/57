Subject: Re: [T2] alt vs.gen

advantages to alterntor:

More amps.
Lighter.
simpler.
Brushes last longer

Advantages to Generator:

you have them and they work.

Both devices work very well.  I waited until I had a problem with my
generator to convert.  Conversion was easy, but try to use real VW parts.
the "conversion kits" have tin and stand of dubious Chinese quality.  IF
you're converting from a bus 38A generator you will need a new fan hub.
