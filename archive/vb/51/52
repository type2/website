Yes, striped left battery tray.
Single position hatches werent carried through all wolfsburg busses, only
through about December of 1955.
Early doglegs with n drain holes and the brazilian style nasty seams. I need
these if anyones got extra.
Bakalite domelights changed about Sept. of 55 or so.
Gas door seal carried through pretty far, my sept 56 standard has it.
Dont forget about the vent latches, the front bumper (they had some
transitions here too, 55-56 having no threaded inserts but having holes for
the license plate), cab doors with the 55 pressing, slightly different than
57-
Cab floor mat is also different for 55's, 56- having an extra notch to clear
the seam roll on the heater duct.
Popout windows are also different with the frame halves having plates
rivited on rather than spot welded.
Yep, the decklids were chopped down from singlecab belly doors.
They had three styles of the lip over the front windshields, early one being
completly flat with the grates, second not having a lip around the grates
but having late pressings on the sides, and finally the late style most
people have.
Also i believe the latch for the gas door flips the oppisite direction as
the later busses...maybe thats nonsense.
Headlight glass is about a one year only thing....
I heard something about turn signal lenses being shorter but never seen one.
The entire cargo floor has a different pressing than hanover busses.
I won't even start with the engine details....but there are a ton.
I'm rambling....see some of you at pomona.
Regards,
Greg Noble
