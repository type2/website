This sounds like trouble...How do you tell the "glass 
repo's with the full Hella scrip on them"  from NOS??

The lens that Thom got were Hella plastic. It was an 
upgrade from the plain
plastic lens. I have these available with your choice of 
plain plastic,
Hella plastic, glass repo with just Hella on them, glass 
repo's with the
full Hella scrip on them or your choice of 4 different 
styles of Hella NOS
glass lens. All units priced according to lens choice.
