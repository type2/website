Subject: engine porsche 356 ??

Hello

one of my friend got an engine he want to put in his combi

The guy said it was from a porsche 356, but i have no reference on this
engine.

The number seems to be : P*00684

Any info on this engine (and possible engine tin and shroud as it came
barely naked) is welcome.

This was put in a kind of Hover boat, but the seller sait it was too fast..

tx
