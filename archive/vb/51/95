Subject: Throw-out fork question

After a search of the archives I have failed to find an 
answer to my problem...Big nut tranny in my '59 DC:

I am replacing the throw-out fork and cannot get the 
snap ring to seat in the shaft's groove inside the bell 
housing. The fork is all assembled with bushings, set 
screw, clutch cable arm and spring. I can't get the fork 
shaft pushed into the the trans far enough to expose 
that groove to seat the snap ring.

Could I have a shaft that has the groove in the wrong 
place or am I assembling something in the wrong order?? 
I only am about an 1/8" shy.

AArrgg!
