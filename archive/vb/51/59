I have Scott Kausch's 55 23 window here in the shop , i just cked it 1
position rear hatch, no lip on the brow vents. Can't say about the dog legs
as both were sorrily installed repops, replaced the front brow area and had
to modify it by removing the lip at the vents. His engine cover has the
funky pressed area's in the inner structure  Jim was talking about , but it
could be from a different bus ,, later
