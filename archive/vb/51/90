Subject: Generator light

I'm having a problem that I can't figure out.  My generator light, as I
accelerate progressively grows brighter.  My generator is putting out 14v as
is my regulator.  My brushes are good, and I have no shorts.  Any ideas as
to why it's doing this?  I did just replace the plug wires if that makes a
difference.

Thanks

Doug
