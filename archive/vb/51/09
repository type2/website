This stuff has been going on back to the early 80's, as I recall.

Many have tried to fight VW, all have failed, and a lot of lawyers
got rich in the process.  Don, are you man enough to take them on?

They even shut down the Oval Window Registry, for some strange reason,
but they don't seem to have a problem with the bus registry:
