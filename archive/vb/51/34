Hi Chris,
Generators are more robust and can handle electrical shorts in the wiring 
harness which will cause most alternators will burn out.  Also you can 
replace the brushes in generators without removing and dissassembling.  The 
main reason for alternator upgrade is if you are planning on mega wattage 
usage like huge stereo and/or off road lighting.
