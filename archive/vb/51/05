The lens that Thom got were Hella plastic. It was an upgrade from the plain
plastic lens. I have these available with your choice of plain plastic,
Hella plastic, glass repo with just Hella on them, glass repo's with the
full Hella scrip on them or your choice of 4 different styles of Hella NOS
glass lens. All units priced according to lens choice.
