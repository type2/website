HI JDD,
If you use a 6 volt starter with a 12 volt FW you will chew off the FW teeth 
till pretty soon you are left in a lurch!  If you use a 6 volt FW (Good idea 
with the bus to use one with a 200mm clutch area!) with a 6 volt starter it 
is a good idea to install a 12 volt solinoid so the starter does not punch 
the FW teeth to death.
