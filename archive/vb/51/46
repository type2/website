Derek,

I have a 56 also, made in mid Feb. of 1956.  One of the last Wolfsburg 
busses.  It has some of the features of the "transition" busses.  It has an 
engine compartment lid that has been repressed from a drop gate.  You can 
tell by looking at the underside and seeing if it has a notch in the seam 
around the inside lip on each side.  Mine also has the funky seal around the 
gas fill door and the curved front transaxle mount.  I am not an expert on 
this, but I have heard that the first Hanover busses have a striped left 
battery tray (sometimes a round impression also).  My battery is right side.  
Also I have heard that the Hanover's had a single position rear hatch (mine 
has 2 positions).  I also believe that the "transition busses" have a 
different type of interior lights.  Mine also has the funky dog legs and they 
switched styles when they went to Hanover.  My PO told me that there was an 
excellent article written on these busses in either VW Trends or Hot VW's 
around '97 or '98 which explains all the differences.  He was not sure which 
publication as he subscribes to both.  I have been looking for the article 
casually, but should exert more effort.  If I run across it I will let you 
know.
