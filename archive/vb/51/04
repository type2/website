Subject: Re: FW: [VB] VWoA say they own the word BUG

My name is Heath im 35yrs old now i live in  High Point North Carolina back 
in 1983, 84, 85  I worked through a co-op program in high school and got a 
job at our local vw dealership which did very little air cooled repair at 
that time.

I was really into air cooled vws so i chose to work for a small shop called 
The bug clinic, soon after i started he was hit with this and had to change 
the name. Several years later i worked for Dannys vw repair and it was not 
long untill vwoa had a problem with him. Both cases happened before 1989.
