David-
 In '59 if you told a VW enthusiast about the TOTAL AR 
resto that you were going to do in what...1999 - 2002 on 
a Double cab, they probably would have laughed their a$$ 
off!
 My wife and I were at the Motor Trend Auto show in Las 
Vegas last weekend (we're considering buying a 2002 EV 
camper). A VW rep told us that the 2002 EV would be the 
end of the model for a two year period, at which time it 
will be reintroduced with new body styling. So Dave, it 
might just be a good candidate for resto in 50 years.
  In 2004 it may be that ugly abonimation they are 
calling the new "Microbus" ughh. 

....Maybe in 50 years we'll form a pre 2003 list and 
belittle the post '03 EVs as "fat chicks"

Anyone want to commit today to an AR resto of a 2002 ev 
in 50 years?  Good
luck :-)

... assuming of course you're still around...
