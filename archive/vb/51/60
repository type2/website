Hi Joel,
Make sure to find a jet sizing tool.  Most used jets either have worn bigger 
over time or some lunk head has drill the jetting diameter open.  Even new 
Mitsuni main jets you can get from Nipponese motorcycle shops that will fit 
the solex carb are often off sized from the stamping on them!
