I was the web builder that posted the event pictures last year as NQ
loaded them to Ronnies page. The original pages were posted to the Omaha
VW Club pages. They can still be seen at
http://www.buskatiers.org/2000/events/bussesbythebridgeV/bbbv/bridge.html
Sorry about the url but it will tke you straight to the page. Please
feel free to got to http://www.buskatiers.org and look around. It is a
great site for a great group.
I would be happy to do it again if we can figure out a way to do it. I
don't think NQ is going to be there and I don't know of anyone that
would be willing to go through all the work he did to get them to me. It
was done through Ronnie and his computer last year. If he was willing to
do the same thing he did last year we just might be able to pull it off.
Any camera folks out there?
