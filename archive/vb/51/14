Subject: Re: [VB] Repro Taillights

I have a set of repros glass lenses on the '60 DD, and have 
one NOS single lense in my parts stash to compare to.  The
repros have a slight orange tint on the outer edge, which is 
hidden by the rubber.  FWIW, I've seen more than one swap whore
trying to pimp these as NOS.  I got mine from Bob Koch, who
was billing them as repro.  Gotta respect that honesty - if 
*anyone* could pimp them as NOS, it would be him.
