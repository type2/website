It is OK to hate technology as long as that doesn't keep you out of the
21st century. As a professional photographer my attitude about cameras
is to use the tool that fits my needs. I use everything from a 4x5 plate
camera to 35mm to a variety of digitals. A quality digital camera will
give you very good pictures. They can be printed on a home printer, sent
to several internet companies for printing or as BBB V showed, put on
the web within minutes of an event taking place so that the whole world
can share the experience. Maybe it is best described as sharing vs
collecting. I have no fear that the best quality images will be around
for a long time.
As for this year there appears that there will be a couple of Buskatiers
that will be attending. More on that later but if you will have some
images you would like included we should be able to get them up.
