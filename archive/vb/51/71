 Carb jetting, uh-huh.
 I have looked at Bentley, looked at obsolete docs Solex manual, looked
 at archives, looked a lot (I'm now dizzy) at the carb and still can't
 figure it out. Why do I seem to have two pilot jets and two power fuel
 systems on my Brosol H30/31? Can anyone clue me in as to what is going
 on here? The thing I need to know most urgently is which is my pilot
 jet and what the is the other one?
 VW FLAPS (Bugformance in Sacramento CA, kinda bug-oriented but I like
 'em anyway, we are learning together) did indeed have Solex main and
 pilot jets, I picked up a good selection, but no air correction /
 emulsion tube jets. Can anyone suggest a source? Are these on Japanese
 motor cycles? >>

I Have picked used jets out of old carbs, and got new ones from a motorcycles 
shop- but I have only bought main jets new.  I can't remember the other jets 
names, so I have to look at the diagram in a rebuild kit.  The Bentley for a 
split wouldn't have the 30/31 pict, as it is a newer carb.  Good carb though, 
I have run one on Bugster for ten years, on three different motors and with a 
variety of distributors.  Don't worry about it too much.  The jet sizing tool 
is a good idea, as a lot of time the jets are not the size they say on them.
