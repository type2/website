Ron, 

I owe you a beer next time you're in SoCal or Denver, wherever I'm at
when you come!

Thanks for supporting DWB. My wife and I have supported them for a
little while now, ever since she worked in a hospital and one of the
doctors there spent 2 months a year overseas for them.

Bus content? Hopefully this one can slip by...

(Ok. Bus content: Heard a rattle for the past week in the rear of the
bus. I figured there was a tool loose somewhere. So I finally had my
son sit in the back seat and tell me where the noise was coming from.
He said under the bus. Ah ha! I crawl underneath and discover the
upper mounting bolt for the pass side shock and come completely out! I
have no idea what was holding the shock upright! So I put a bit of
threadlock and tightened it down, then went around and did the same to
all four bolts.)
