Josh,
The spark plug wire from the distributor to the spark plugs. As you had
to move them and pull on them they can fail internally.
P & C
We have broken (cracked) a new plug as we put it in.
Gap of the plug?? got something across the plug during installation.
Old stand by remove one wire at a time to fine which one drops the rpms
the least.
