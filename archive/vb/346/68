 looked on the WW site and the rebuild kit does not look like the one that

yes, it should have two tubes... one for 'reserve' and one for 'on'.  they 
may have pics of the bug fuel tap, but the rebuild kit is the same for both bug 
and bugs fuel taps.  the directions that come with it are also for bug, but 
the tap isn't so different to take apart ... you basically install a couple 
rubber doohickeys so it doesn't leak.

you do mean the rebuild KIT, right, not buying a TAP
???
