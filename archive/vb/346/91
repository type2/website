Some of my sheet metal in fact IS from Schofield. Any of my part numbers
starting with AHS, and most of the ones with 5 and 6 digit part numbers as
well.

But not everything from Schofield is actually made by Schofield. Some of
what he sells is very high quality and of his own manufacture. But some he
buys from other suppliers, such as Klokkerholm/Denmark.

And not everything from Klokkerhom/Denmark is actually made by
Klokkerholm/Denmark. Some of what they sell also comes from other suppliers,
principally in Brazil. (In particular some of their splitty metal and their
bay-window complete noses.)

So you could theoretically order a piece of supposedly European made sheet
metal that was actually made in Brazil, then shipped to Denmark, then to the
U.K., and then finally to America - almost a round trip!  By the time you
paid to give your piece of metal a trip around the world (with each supplier
marking it up along the way, of course), it would cost four times what it
cost if it went directly from South America to North America. So obviously I
try to get right to the actual source of the product.

For bay-window busses, almost all of my metal is either made in the U.K. or
Denmark, except for a few pieces that are actually made by Volkswagen
themselves (principally in Brazil, but they're genuine VW and far superior
to any aftermarket version regardless of origin). The notable exception is
the full nose, which is decent quality but is aftermarket Brazilian. At this
point, most everything else is still available from Europe or from VW. I
think I can safely say that as a rule you could not buy better quality metal
for your Bus at any price (much less at my prices).

For splitties, it's a combination of Klokkerholm, Schofield, and Brazilian.
Frankly, probably 2/3 of it is Brazilian because I can't get better
sourcing. I wish I could get almost all genuinely European made metal as I
can with the later busses, but I can't. Still, like I said, in many cases
the splitty metal sold in Europe actually originates from Brazil anyway,
despite labeling to the contrary (and correspondingly higher prices). So at
least you will know that you won't pay European prices only to get relabled
Brazilian parts anyway.
