Subject: Diaphragm material

I am trying to rebuild my gas heater's fuel pump on my 67 bus. I want 
to use the latest materials for the diaphragm. I hear that the old 
material will not last with the current gasolines. What I am looking 
for is a source for the sheet material (i.e. Viton rubber) to make the 
diaphragm from. Anybody have any experience with this?

Thanks, Rocky
