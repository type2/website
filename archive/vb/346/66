Subject: BN4/BN2 plugs

I need some help sourcing (is that a word?) these glow/spark plugs for gas
heaters.
Beru:
EBE 514 
140 M 12V
GZE22
195 GLS/GL etc
I have a buddy stationed in Germany who's willing to go shopping for me but
I don't know if you can go to any auto parts store and get these or not.
Do they have Checker auto in Germany?
I just need to know where to tell my buddy to go shopping.
Thanks for any and all help,
