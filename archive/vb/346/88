There are politics going both ways on this thing... Sri-Lanka refuses donations from Israel because of "religious" differences. I'm sure that makes alot of difference to the poor family who lost everything and are desparate for some rice and clean water... 

I have to wonder... What are the Muslim nations doing for their brother Muslim nations??? 

Politics! <Ugh!>
