Subject: Re: [VB] fuel reserve valve 

Hi John,
It does make it a lot easier to do this with the engine out.  Make  sure to 
disconnect the battery, because the starter connections are WAY too  close to 
be wrenching around in there.  The union nut that mounts  the reserve switch to 
the tank has left and right threads so you can hold the  switch in the 
position you want and thread/pull the tank and switch together  with the union nut.  
So get out your VW Transporter Workshop manual for the  "Fuel Tap Removal and 
Installation" in section "K".  Order up a  reserve switch rebuild kit and the 
gaskets with fuel filter socket.
