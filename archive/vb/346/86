ok, update:

i took off the little "caps" that unscrewed from the
spark plugs, and started her up. i got her to idle
after about 30 seconds of nursing the gas pedal. after
she would stay running, i re-checked the timing, still
good at 7.5 degreese BTDC, and still running like
crap, so i upped the idle a bit when i noticed a
little floppy screw.

(sorry for the quality)

the carb is i believe a 30 pict 2. the screw i am
talking about is somewhere in the incircled area. the
screw was stripped out. any ideas???
thanks a bunch,
josh.
