Howdy folks,

Does anyone out in splittyland have a good screw terminal wiper motor?
Looks like the one in my 60 is toast, and I would like to replace it before
heading up to the mountains for some snowboarding, and/or possibly Mt. Shasta
(we'll see).

Anyways, let me know if you got one and we can discuss price and shipping.

Thanks,
Beto
