Subject: Re: [VB] tow hitch

I have seen a variety of tow hitches made for splitty buses, and have  indeed 
used one on my 61 to tow various things, including a bug 500  miles.  It 
clamped to the rear torsion tube, and had up/down support  at the rear bumper with 
a curved piece the same shape as the curve of the rear  bumper.  Makes it 
annoying to pull the motor. I don't know if anyone  is currently making them.   I 
saw a westfalia tow hitch sell for $700  recently, but I think that was one 
to fit with a stamped bumper.  You might  peruse swaps and the samba 
classifieds.

Hi  there,

I want to put a tow hitch on my '65 splitty (to tow something,  not to be
towed). The local shop I usually go to says no one makes them  anymore
and he doesn't do fabrication anymore either. He also said it  looked
like someone extended the rear bumper, so any stock tow hitch that  I
find might not fit.

Sooooo, given all that, is there hope to buy a  manufactured one or
should I go to a fabricator/welder I have used in the  past for other
stuff and ask him to make me one? Any help  appreciated.

Jason
