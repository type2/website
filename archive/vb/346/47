John,
We have used the chrome spray paint even to touch up-(maybe more than 
touch up)-rust spots on chrome wheels and that has held up fare and that 
not inside your protected light assembly.
We have just sprayed the front turn signal reflector on one side (the 
rusted side) (68 bay sorry) and it now looks as good or better than the 
stock side.
P & C
