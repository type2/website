Subject: Headliner -> vinyl vs hardboard

Hi -

	I have a 64 standard with a portion of the original headliner left ( the part over the cab ).  I have a so42 westy kit that will be put in the back.  I am thinking about getting the harboard headliner panels over the cab? Will they fit in the groove that is there for the headliner.  The portion that's left is actually in good shape; what are my other options?

	thanks

	-rob
