A warning to all: The "Victims" in most cases are anyone that has any
financial dealings with Mr. Gavazzi (aka: kafertoys)
http://hometown.aol.com/littlevwgoddess/page5.html

he took me for $5k, and my company ( Aircooled.Net) for another $5k; Do not
say I didn't warn you. There are better places to do business then with him.
There is a very detailed website going up about his antics shortly
(switching vehicle VINs, selling parts off of customer vehicles, selling
"customer" cars to others, etc etc. This link above is a hastily prepared
one but covers some interesting stuff and should give you enough info to
stay away. This link is just to counter Mr. Gavazzi's claims that this stuff
never happened (like landing on the moon perhaps).

He operates under the premise of doing people favors, but is actually
preparing them for slaughter.

Do NOT say I didn't warn you!

of
 the victims and make my customers happy.
