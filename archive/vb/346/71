Hi Volks,
We take pull out the short brass tube.  It is there to trap water and  gunk 
in the bottom of the tank, but the problem with this is the tank rusts  out!  
Plus it is a lot easier to just pull the drain plug on the left side  of the 
carb to get rid of water.  The gaskets you rebuild the reserve  switch with are 
cork with some kind of coating.  Make sure to read in  the workshop manual how 
to rebuild it properly!  We did not the  first time and damaged the new 
gaskets, due to not putting in the  lubricant.  Duh!
