Disconnecting the battery is the 100% safe way to go.  However, it might
happen that you don't want to fry the Compu-fire, but you need juice in
the rest of the Bus to chase some other problem.  In that case, you can
just disconnect the black wire from the ignition switch (the one that
also goes to the choke element and the fuel solenoid) at the coil to
isolate the coil, CompuFire/points, and condenser.  If this wire doesn't
have a push-on connector, you might add one to make disconnecting and
reconnecting it easier.  Make sure that the loose end of the wire can't
ground out on anything metal on the engine, and you should be good to
use the rest of the Bus electrical system as much as you want.
