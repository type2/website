I see them at swaps fairly often, or you could check the classifieds on the Samba. ( I have one on there). 
 
I think there is a guy in Texas who is making hitches as well. Dave Barnes had one on his bus and it looked like a well made hitch. Maybe he'll read this and help you out as I don't have the gentlemans contact info.

Hi there,

I want to put a tow hitch on my '65 splitty (to tow something, not to be
towed). The local shop I usually go to says no one makes them anymore
and he doesn't do fabrication anymore either. He also said it looked
like someone extended the rear bumper, so any stock tow hitch that I
find might not fit.

Sooooo, given all that, is there hope to buy a manufactured one or
should I go to a fabricator/welder I have used in the past for other
stuff and ask him to make me one? Any help appreciated.

Jason

Ps: Merry Christmas all
