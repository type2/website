greyhound is not cheap if you figure by the pound
http://www.shipgreyhound.com/

where greyhound works is  with large items,  some too big for UPS - Fed EX

especially if they are light + big and UPS charges you oversize (30lb rate ) 
or second oversize (70lb rate) , 

the VESPA is way too big if its in  one piece  for greyhound
