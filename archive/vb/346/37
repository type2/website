That's the honorable thing to do, but the unfortunate reality is that no
deal is a deal until you have title in your name.

A few years back I went to look at a motorcycle that had a very attractive
price.  I showed up at the same time as another prospective buyer and it
turned out that the seller wanted us to bid against each other.

We two buyers looked at each other and my competitor said "flip you for
it"!

Needless to say, the seller was not happy with this arrangement and said
that he wouldn't sell unless we bid the price up.  We countered that he
had advertised a price and should honor it.  The fact that there were two
of us and only one of him seemed to carry the day.

I lost the flip, but gained a lot of satisfaction from the experience.
