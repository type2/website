Subject: RE: [VB] tyre size

 Mike try this website. Put in your tire size's (width,series,diameter)it is
about half the way down the page and it will give you height. If you want
rpm's put in the table right below and it will give you rpm based on gear
ratio.

Merry Christmas to All!
Please, listmembers, could you tell me how one calculates tyre sizes? For
starters, what does 165 or 175 and so on, actually mean? How does / 70 or /
80 relate? Best Wishes from Johannesburg, South Africa.
