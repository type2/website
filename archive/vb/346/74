Subject: Front backing plates / drums.

While doing some much needed house cleaning at my shop over the 3 day 
weekend I found that I have quite a stockpile of front Bus drums and 
backing plates.
Both the early 55 - 63 and later 64 -67 style. All are good used that 
need cleaning / turning, but definitely within spec. If anyone needs 
anything, let me know.
