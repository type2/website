Most VDO temperature sensors (except for cylinder head
temperature) are a variable resistor from the terminal to
ground.  The dipstick sender grounds through the dipstick
tube; the sender with pipe threads grounds through the
threads.  So the same wiring can be used for either.  One
thing that might be different is the resistance ranges of
the sensors, but VDO seems to be fairly consistent in this
regard.

If you want to know for sure, take the dipstick sender off
the car, get the other sender, and take them inside.  Let
both senders sit around for an hour or two to make sure
they're the same temperature, then measure and record the
resistance of each sender between the terminal and the
metal case.  Now, arrange for the two sensors to be warmed
up evenly, like by sticking the business end of the sensors
in a pan of water on the stove.  WARNING: Personal protective equipment may be required, especially if your
other half comes home and finds greasy VW parts in the
good saucepan!  Anyway, as the sensors heat up, periodically
measure and record the resistance of each one.  What you
are looking for is the same or nearly the same (within 5% or
so) values from both sensors at each reading.  If the
readings are the same, then the gauge will work OK with
the new sensor.  If they are wildly different, or if the
curves go in a different direction (one has less resistance
as it heats up and the other has more), it won't work.

Good luck!
