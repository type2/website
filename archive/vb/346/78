hey all,

  my rita bus is running like crap. i changed spark
plugs, spark plug wires, rotor, cap, condensor,
points, re-timed her, and adjusted the valves and now
she is running so badly that she wont stay at idle.
what are all of the possibilities that could be making
my bus do this? she is running a 1600cc single port
motor with a 205 K vac. advance dist.

thanks in advance.
