Subject: charging questions

The 70 Westy seems to be having problems.
The generator light always goes off after starting, but the battery has  been 
going flat.
Clara (lw) changed the brushes in the generator and after an overnight  
trickle charge everything seems OK.
But no! After a coupe of days it seemed to present this problem.
 It starts and the voltage meter goes up to 14-15 volts. Then the  voltage 
drops to 12 volts as I expect.
 I then put on the lights and wipers and the voltage drops below 10  Volts. 
It stays there even when the engine is revved up.
I have a new solid state voltage regulator to put on, is that going to work  
or do I need a new battery?
 
I have regrets to use a transistorized regulator as I will be susceptible  to 
an EMP. The early buses are one of the few cars that will survive, but who is 
 going to nuke us?
