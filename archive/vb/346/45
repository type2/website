Subject: tail light housing

So .... I pulled off the tail-light housing in my 60 today and they should be
re-conditioned.  They are both all oxidized and the shinny stuff is coming off
of one of them.  Anyone ever re-condition those things.  Getting them chromed
would be cool but I don't think it would really be practical even all of the
little parts.  Is there some sort of shinny paint or something that can fix em
up.  I was thinking just tape off the wire connectors and spray the outside
with some sort of silver paint ... then spray the inside with something shiny
- but is that available - I know these can be easily replaced but I would like
to get these ones.

TIA
