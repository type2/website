Subject: True Canadian Winter Bus Campout, February 19-20, 2005

Hi Volks,

2004 was the best camping season I've ever had in 40 years on this 
planet. In total, I spent something like 31 nights sleeping in my westy 
with my family while attending or traveling to a VW Bus Event. Thanks 
go out to everyone in the community who helped make that happen. Ford 
Focus owners don't have near this much fun with their cars, trust me.




SO WHAT?

So now I'm inviting everyone to the first camp-out on my list for 2005, 
the True Canadian Winter Bus Campout. This event got started last 
winter when the hard-core amongst us here in Southern Ontario decided 
that we just couldn't wait until EveryBus, and the warm weather was too 
far away to dive to for a weekend. Thus became the TCWBC.



DETAILS:

Who: Anyone with a VW who wants to join us for a night in the Frigid 
North. This may mean you. We have even heard from a couple of crazy 
yankees who are planning to recreate the 1812 invasion, except that 
this time we Canadians are going to be picking them up at the Buffalo 
airport.  ...Laura Secord must be spinning in her grave...

Where: Valens Conservation Area, near Hamilton Ontario, just east of 
Cambridge. Under an hour's drive west from Toronto.

When: February 19th - 20th.

Cost: To get in on the group menu will cost $10.  Our group menu is 
planned to reduce food prep and cleanup as much as possible, an 
important detail when camping in winter. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IN ADVANCE 
IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON EATING WITH THE GROUP. The menu will be posted 
on the web-page below.
This year's dinner: Chili in a bread bowl!

Camping fees: Valens charges $26.50 for an electric site, but you can 
share that with a second vehicle for an additional $7 and split the 
difference, bringing it down to $17/bus.

Bonus: If you like a good campfire, then this is THE camp-out for you. 
It gets dark very early in February, and with the cold weather up here 
a good campfire is critical. TCWBC will not let you down. If you can 
bring firewood, please do so.

Bonus #2: Adam Narraway will once again be providing us with his fine 
Silk-Screened garments. Long-sleeved T's and hooded sweats will be on 
the menu for 2005. More details will be coming soon.
