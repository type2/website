I advertised a '66 for a set amount and found a buyer.
He kept promising to pick it up, week after week. Finally
I realized that I wanted to keep the bus, so I set a hard 
and fast deadline date, otherwise the deal was off, hoping
that he'd flake, and I would keep the bus.

He made the deadline by a few hours, and I still regret 
selling the bus, but as others have said, a deal is a deal,
so it went away.
