Subject: new list member with resto project

Hey folks,

I've been a type2 list member for 4 years and am just now venturing into the
vintage world with my first split resto project.

I am restoring a '62 single cab for a local customer. I will more than likely
need some help from time to time. I am just now pulling everyting apart and
will be stripping paint over the next week and am going to start prepareing a
sheet metal order. Many of my current baywindow parts suppliers carry most
parts that I need but there is always the chance that NLA parts will be
needed. Here I will look to the list for help. If anyone has any suggestions
and or warnings about really hard to find parts please let me know. Thank you
for your help

-Joe
