Subject: Re: [T2] Help BusDepot Donate to Tsunami Victims

this is from Bus Depot
I'm sure that by now most of you have heard of the tsunamis/earthquake in
Asia that have killed more than 23,000 people so far << we know its 4x that 
now

The Bus Depot has always donated a portion of our profits to humanitarian
charities on an ongoing basis. (See http://busdepot.com/help.jsp#DONATIONS
.)  But I feel that the severity of this disaster demands special attention.


So from now until New Years, 25 percent of the net profits of BusDepot.com
sales will be donated to Doctors Without Borders, to provide medical relief
for the victims of this tragedy.

  My Part, I have to make an order for about $900 to a $1000 in bus parts, 
meaning ur to $250 in donations from them.

I was going to order from Schofield in the UK knowing that there quality is 
up to my standards. 
I need floor sections, battery boxes, dog legs door bottoms for a 63 21 
window, 67 deluxe and 65 deluxe, Can I expect a quality I will be happy with from 
them and still help out the victims. 
You have to understand I als have to make my customers happy.

So I guess I'm asking if you have restored a bus where you real happy with 
their quality?
