Chris,

What about mounts?  Are you running stock, urethane, straps, etc?  Even some
of the aftermarket rubber mounts feel much harder than in years past.  They
will transfer more noise than any other single thing.

Urethane Mounts

My bus is a double door and as such it has a full belly pan. Was underneath 
today and rapped upon that expanse of formed and dimpled metal and what a 
resonance it has. Maybe all that noise in the cab is partially to blame on 
that belly pan.
