Subject: Re: [T2] Interesting idle problem

Thanks for all the input. It is most likely as I suspected. There must be a
resonance in the air flow due to the short intakes. Fuel/air gets sucked into
2 and 4, the idle jets can't keep up and  air gets sucked into 1 and 3 (or at
least too little fuel to burn).
