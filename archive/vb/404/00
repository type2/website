yes, for  this i suggest a 1968 Volvo Station Wagon.




Hi Hermine,
Cute, but untrue.  Even the most modern Volvo will not have its engine  up to 
the 160 F minimum oil/water temp in just two to three  minutes!!  On top of 
this you are not going to heat up the interior in  freezing weather to 80 F in 
much less than ten minutes.
  Thusly installing gas heater not only keeps one warm in the coldest  
climates (pretty much a standard equipment for VWs in Canada), but also add  value 
to your old VW being it was a nifty stock accessory.
E&B
