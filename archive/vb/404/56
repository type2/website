Hi,

Who is a good upholsterer in the greater Los Angeles, Orange County area.
Want to get my seats done right. Have 1/3-2/3 seats in front, a camper bed 
in back, want it to match
the front seats and do my front door panels and kick panels to match too.

And a happy New Year to All.

Thanks,
Chris
