Hi Jdd,
First you will need to modify the later E-brake cables to work in the  1960.  
Also a good idea to install the 1964-67 front suspension and  20% bigger 
badder brakes.  Doing so will avoid having the later wider  rear brakes mismatched 
with the earlier front brakes and possibly cause braking  problems.
E&B
