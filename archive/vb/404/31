Wow,

Another excellent bus year. Busses By the Bridge, OCTO, BNNTA, The Classic, 
The Treffen, Jerome.... And all those not listed. Let's do them all once 
again.

Tell us about your travels. The successes, the failures, the breakdowns, the 
comeraderie, Who you helped and who you didn't. What's new on your bus.

Merry Christmas and to all a Good Night.
Chris
