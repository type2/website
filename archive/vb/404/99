Hey,

Thanks for the info. I've decided that the place to start is to see if I can 
quiet down my engine. I am going to tear is down, have all the rotating 
parts balance checked and cc the heads. Also have the valves lapped. I also 
have OEM sheet metal and the temp control flaps that I will install. From 
there I'll start over with the sound proofing.

Regards
