Subject: Re: [VB] Interesting problem. 

I believe it's mostly the fact that one cyl. takes the away from the other at
idle but someone with more technical savvy could answer you better.
If the idle circuit/jets were plugged, as E&B suggested, it wouldn't idle at
all.  Each carb is a single barrel, if it runs on one cyl. the jet is not
plugged.  One cyl. is strong and the adjoining cyl. is weak is normal on a
dual single carb set-up while idling.
That's the best I can explain it.
