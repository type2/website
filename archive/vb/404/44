Subject: Auxiliary Fuel Tank Options

This inquiry is directed towards truck owners, but only 'cuz we have more
fuel tank room than the buses and panels.

Since my crew cab is back running again, this problem immediately popped up
about 'miles per tank.'  My mpg runs around 12 and that gives me about 100
mile range before I start getting nervous.  I stopped 5 times just from LA
to SF!  I should add that is w/o gauge.

Has anyone found a tank that holds a lot more?  I've used bay window tanks
before, but I was hoping someone had come across a big, long, flat tank that
fits.  On my Baja trips, we used to take along 2 splittie tanks on the roof
rack.  CHP kinda frowns on that in the US!
