Subject: Wiring Pic Clarification

** To those who responded, thank you!! I have a wiring
diagram, I would like a visual specifically on where
and how the high/low beam box attaches and where.  My
wiring functions, it is just all over... thanks.

Not really a technical question, more a visual, any I
would appreciate the help. 

My bus is a 66 standard walk through. I am trying to
clean up my wiring under the package tray. My hi/low
is hanging loose, and wiring is kinda all over... Can
someone please post a pic of the OG setup? Please
include the hi/low, 9 box, and fuse box.
