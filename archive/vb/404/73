Tristan,

Measured with and without the fan today. Noise level was running from 84-95 
dbC with or without the fan. No noticeable difference.
Made the measurements in the garage with my windows closed. Idle is at the 
low end, engine rev'd to maybe 2500-3000 at the high end. Don't have a tach.

Andy, let us know what you find in your bus.

Thanks,
Chris
