Hi,
Matt, you wanted levels in another vehicle.
My 94 Ford Ranger at idle in the driveway is at about 70dbC, reved to 
2500rpm its at about 74dbC, driving around the neighborhood up to 45mph it 
goes to 84-88dbC depending upon the road quality.

Even at 85dbC, listening to the radio is just fine at normal volume levels. 
Don't really need to turn it up any louder than at idle.
Bus content. My bus is noisier at idle than my truck at 45 mph.
