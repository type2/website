Subject: Re: [VB] Noise in my bus

Hi Rennie,

I'd say that 80+ percent is engine noise, then there is some road noise and 
a little wind noise. I have pretty good seals on all my doors and on the 
jelousie windows in back I have an interior 3/8" thick plexiglass panel in 
place of the window screens. Spent a little time shimming and adjusting all 
the door seals too.
The partition idea is not bad, but I think that I will try doing more sound 
proofing on the engine compartment and the fire wall. Could just be that 
there is a lot of engine vibration conducted thru the tranee mounts and into 
the bus frame all to be amplified by the sheet metal and especially the 
plywood camper interior.
