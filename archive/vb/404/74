Subject: road noise

i'd like to see a reading of the levels in back... over the engine 
deck, and in the back seat.
in my 70, i found the front seat to be louder than either of those 
places (anecdotaly; i don't have a db meter). f'r instance:  i drove 
two jazz musicians from austin to houston a few years back - matt and 
i had to talk loudly in the front seat, while william dozed off in 
back. he said 'it purred like a kitten back there... BIG kitten... 
with a bone in its throat... but soothing.' didn't seem load at all.

that leads me to believe that road (tire) noise is the biggest 
culprit, followed by wind noise. i'd also wonder if the bus doesn't 
have resonance points, where noise gets amplified by the thing's 
construction in certain areas.

other than changing tire styles, i found that placing something, 
anything over expanses of sheet metal like doors, body panels, etc 
were most effective at reducing noise. i used thick tar, others used 
dynamat. good seals help keep out wind noise. don't forget that roof 
rack!  mine whistles unless i have plywood on it; then it moans.

last, if you don't have your heater boxes hooked up, i've found sound 
travels pretty well up the heater pipes if you don't block off the 
ends near the tranny.

i actually got the 70's motor so quiet vs. road noise that i COULDN'T 
hear the motor as well as i liked, and thus worried about missing any 
sounds which meant impending doom!
