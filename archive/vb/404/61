Subject: Re: [VB] Interesting problem.

I dont know the carbs specifically, but I was thinking a vacuum gauge 
might be helpful.
When I worked on bikes (4 cyl japanese) we would sync the carbs using 
vacuum at idle. Each carb has its own vacuum tap.
I am sure you know this already but I think vacuum gauges are not used 
as often as they could be.
I assume that these carbs function as if they were separate individual 
as in one carb per cylinder as opposed to a primary and secondary (like 
a 4 barrel).

Another idea might be to introduce fuel to the non running venturi and 
see.  At Honda school they told to use a propane torch (unlit), it was 
helpful finding those air leaks.

I probably did not tell you any thing you dont know but
happy new year any way
