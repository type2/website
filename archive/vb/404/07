I was searching the archives for:

There was a young Lady from BC,, she had an accident with a really nice
bus.. someone in TN gave her a bus... so she travelled from BC to TN with
major stuff like engine,,trans, tools... to be able to drive the bus home..
which in the end .. she was successful!

anyone remember enough to find that in the archives..
