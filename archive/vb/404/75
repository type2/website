It might be interesting to get some numbers for comparison from other
vehicles, like an old (US) pickup truck, a newer pickup truck, a newer
passenger car, etc.

Bosch 5th edition has a little about noise, but it is mostly concerned
with *external* noise levels - how much noise somebody standing on the
street hears.  The European regulatory testing setup looks like this:

         A <- 10 m -> | <- 10 m -> B
         |            |            |
-Bus->  |            |            |    ---
         |            |            |     ^
         A            |            B   7.5 m
                      |                  v
                      M                 ---

The microphone is at M, pointed at the road, 7.5 m (25 feet) from the
center of the road. You would drive a Bus in from the left in second
gear at a constant speed until you hit the starting line, A-A.  You
then floor it until you hit the finish line, B-B, at which point the
test is over.  The limits in 92/97/EEC (from October 1995) are...

what           rated    power      limit
Passenger car  -        -          74 dB (A)
Truck, bus     < 2 t    -          76 dB (A)
Truck, bus     2-3.5 t  -          76 dB (A)
Bus            > 3.5 t  <= 150 kW  78 dB (A)
Bus            > 3.5 t  > 150 kW   80 dB (A)
Truck          > 3.5 t  <= 75 kW   77 dB (A)
Truck          > 3.5 t  <= 150 kW  78 dB (A)
Truck          > 3.5 t  > 150 kW   80 dB (A)

For cars, and trucks and buses up to 3.5 t, you get 1 more dB (A) for a
direct-injection diesel, and 1 more dB (A) for a 4WD or off-road
vehicle.  Note that these are metric tons; 2 t is 4410 lb and 3.5 t is
7720 lb.  75 kW is 100 hp and 150 kW is 200 hp.

For interior noise, they say "no legal requirements" (as of September
2000).  Also: "The interior noise is measured, e.g. at constant speed or
when gradually accelerating in the range from 60 km/h or 40% of the
maximum driving speed, as the A-weighted sound pressure level and then
plotted as a function of the driving speed.  One series of measurements
is always to be made at the driver's seat" and the rest depends on how
many seats there are.

Depending on how pretty the inside of your Bus is, you can try various
temporary things to decide where to focus your efforts.  For instance,
throw a blanket over the engine hump behind the back seat and go drive -
if that makes things a lot better, maybe that's a good place to do
something more permanent.  (If your Bus isn't pretty, tape the blanket
in place.  If it is, use a hard drive magnet or other strong magnet to
hold it down.)  Or, try some fiberglass insulation batts, like you would
use in your house.  You probably wouldn't use blankets or fiberglass for
permanent installation (they both tend to trap water), but they can help
you figure out whether the noise is coming from the engine, or the
side panels drumming, or what.

Safety note: If you're trying to take measurements while rolling, get
somebody else to help!  It is hard to steer, shift, brake, operate the
sound meter, and write things down all at once.  Yes, the presence of a
second person will alter the sonic environment.  Until you're testing a
car that was designed in this century, though, the effect will probably
be, uh, lost in the noise.  So to speak.  :)
