Hey Guys,

Thanks for the insights and comments. You've most likely seen my posts on 
what I've done to quiet down my 64 DD camper to no avail.

1. Dynamat over the entire engine compartment area (inside vehicle), the 
roof, the side walls and the doors.
2. 2 layers of JC Whitney NASA insulation over the engine compartment, roof, 
side walls and doors.
3. 1 layer of NASA insulation over the back floor and front floor. No 
Dynamat in these areas.
4. 1 layer of heavy, 1/8" thick, tar like roofing material over the engine 
compartment layers and back floor.
5. 2 layers of dynamat over the front wheel wells under the standard foam 
and vinyl covers.
6. Dynamat inside the front doors and the back sides of the door panels.
7. 1 layer of NASA insulation on the roof of the engine compartment (thats 
inside the engine compartment). I have not done anything to the interior 
side walls of the engine compartment around the vent louvers. That metal 
still rings when tapped.

I have most all of the plywood interior installed as well as the rear fold 
down seat. The seat cushions are 4" foam with vinyl covers.

All the doors go thud when closing. No ringing. The rear hatch barely stays 
up on its own with all the extra weight.

Now that I have a meter, I'm about to take out all the removeable stuff 
(Dynamat is rather permanent) and start over concentrating on the engine 
compartment.

Another possibility is that I just have a damn friggin noisy engine that 
needs to be torn down, rebalanced and put back together. I have standard 
german rubber trannee mounts. There's gotta be a lot of vibration getting 
conducted thru to the frame and body.

Matt, tomorrow I'll take a ride in my 94 Ford pickup and post the noise 
levels. Likely to be fairly quiet. Its a nice ride.
