Subject: 66 Wiring Pic Request

Not really a technical question, more a visual, anyway
I would appreciate the help. 

My bus is a 66 standard walk through. I am trying to
clean up my wiring under the package tray. My hi/low
is hanging loose, and wiring is kinda all over... Can
someone please send me a pic of the OG setup? Please
include the hi/low, 9 box, and fuse box.
