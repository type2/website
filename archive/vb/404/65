HI,

Just for comparison, the dbA scale gave around 75-80 db.

I was driving around town, so my speed varied from 0-45mph.

The meter has a dbA and a dbC scale. The description in the manual says that
dbA measures from 500-10000 hz and dbC measures from 32-10000 hz. I had always
suspected that most of the noise was below 500 hz.

And yes, 95-100db is loud.

I need to take some more readings such as reving the engine while not moving,
around town and on the freeway.
Will post more info from time to time.

Chris
