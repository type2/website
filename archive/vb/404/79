Subject: Re: [VB] Noise again

Another interesting item.

My bus is a double door and as such it has a full belly pan. Was underneath 
today and rapped upon that expanse of formed and dimpled metal and what a 
resonance it has. Maybe all that noise in the cab is partially to blame on 
that belly pan.

Would be interesting to compare noise levels to a non-DD bus. Anyone in the 
L.A. area game to find out?
p-mail me.
