As a kid, our car always had several military wool blankets to keep us  
warm. I don't remember a day in the winter not having one around me.  
That's why my parents said to heck with it and moved us to San Antonio.

If you need heat, get yourself a aux. heater like a big buddy or a  
fancy Propex. The factory aux heater in my aircooled '80 Vanagon was a  
cooker. The only thing that was missing was a timer, but that seems  
like it would be a easy hack.

There was a really good thread about aux heaters about 3-5 years ago...
