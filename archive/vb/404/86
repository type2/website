Chris,
All of the parts need to be balanced together.  The pistons out of
the box will not weigh the same and need to be equal.  The large and
small ends of the rods can be made the same weight.  Your
counterweighted crank is not balanced.  As one piece, the pulley,
crank, flywheel and pressure plate need to be dynamically balanced.
Also, the heads should be cc'd and each bore made exactly the same.
It is almost scary how smooth these little engines can run when all
is balanced.  In Tucson balancing  VW engine parts costs around $120
and the head work around $100.
A balanced engine is quiet, well for a VW, and they will last a long
time.  I know some engine builders who I respect who do not balance
everything.  One of these guys gives me a hard time about using line-
bored cases.  I let them hear how smooth my engines run and they let
 it go...
