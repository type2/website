Subject: Interesting problem.

Hey Volks,

I was looking at a new engine in a bus today, 1776DP, dual solex carbs, dual 
quiet pak mufflers. Nothing fancy.

The problem:  At idle it runs on 2 and 4. Pulling the plug wires on 1 and 3 
does nothing to the idle. Cold air coming out the exhausts even after 3-4 
minutes of idle. With plugs wired connected, exhaust manifolds at 1 and 3 
stay cold. Once engine is above idle, it seems to run normally.  At idle, 
its a little rough, but certainly not out of the ordinary.

Changing carbs to webers or dels and the "problem" goes away.

Any ideas as to what is going on?

Chris
