Subject: Re: [VB] Re: noise

my 67 standard with no back seats is very noisy. when we drive usually 
we have the windows open. At speeds over 45 or so you have to yell to 
have a conversation.
A radio is useless- just more noise, so is the ipod. I can put the ear 
plugs in and turn it up but when I stop it is way too loud.
I had a 65 standard in about 83 to 85 and it was just as noisy. I have 
noticed that with just about any van when you fill it up with stuff it 
gets much quieter and the ride is less bumpy-including american.
After charley I put  a good ton of new on the pallet fence pickets in 
my 67. It  was very quiet I won $10 from the loading guys and i could 
barely stop. I have hav many vans full of every thing but money. and 
usually it get quieter unless the cargo is teenage girls.

My 68,69,70, and 71westy were all quieter. I remember being able to 
talk to the passenger and listen to the radio- it was probably led 
Zeppelin or Ozzy. So that has been my experience.

I have often wondered about the 20,000 dollar busses are they just as 
loud. or when they were new. I doubt they were much quieter when new.

what to all of you think, and do you thing bays are quieter?
