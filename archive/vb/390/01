Subject: Re: [VB] clutch cable issue?

Hi Kevin,
You do not need to remove the clutch cable to deal with the pedal  assembly.
  Have someone push the clutch pedal down, while you are under the  Bus.  
Clamp two pieces of wood onto the cable just forward of the body  tube.  Then 
when pressure is let up on the clutch pedal you will have all  the slack you need.
  Definitely keep soaking the wing nut and get it loose!  Then  grease or 
never seize that up.  You should look into adding a zerk fitting  or two to your 
pedal assembly.
