Subject: Re: [VB] bug fenders

You can check them onto a plane, but they are probably oversized as luggage, 
and would cost $25 extra to do that.

I have found I can get large cardboard boxes from behind furniture stores.
Fedex is good on shipping, and there is one at every Kinko's these days.
Might cost about $40 to ship fenders to the east coast.   I have shipped 
fenders before, they are 2nd oversize, which means they go at the 30lb rate even 
if they weigh less.  Cost $30 or $25 to ship them to CA from WA.

Fedx will drop them at the door, so your friend doesn't have to haul the big 
box around.

You could also try Greyhound Package Express for shpping large objects.  It 
would have to be dropped off and picked up at the Greyhound Bus Station.

Hope that helps.

I recently got a bug from my friend Kate. It needs new fenders, and another
friend has them. They are in California. A third friend-Laura is flying from
San Francisco to Boston next week, and offered to take the fenders with her.

How practical is this? Ie can you check fenders onto a plane? How much extra
would it cost? Has anyone ever done this? Is it worth the hassle, and would
the fenders survive the trip intact?
