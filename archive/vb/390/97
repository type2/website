Subject: bug fenders

This is a like math word problem., but with vw parts involved. 

I recently got a bug from my friend Kate. It needs new fenders, and another
friend has them. They are in California. A third friend-Laura is flying from
San Francisco to Boston next week, and offered to take the fenders with her.

How practical is this? Ie can you check fenders onto a plane? How much extra
would it cost? Has anyone ever done this? Is it worth the hassle, and would
the fenders survive the trip intact?

Thanks for your input, I know this is not directly bus or t3 related, but it
is vw related,
