Measuring at the outer rim (lip) of the front wheels at 6 and 9 o'clock, I 
simply measured and adjusted the front 1/8" shorter than the rear. I believe 
that is how Muir described it in How to Keep Your VW Alive.

I was at first not sure if it was valid to do this with the weight off of 
the suspension, but I figured that since the front end pivots off of the 
parallel leaf springs that it would be OK. Seems that I was right and it 
sure was easy. I've crawled under the car numerous times with it on the 
ground and its kinda iffy as to whether the measurement is good or not. and 
obviously it was not because the vehicle never tracked as well as it does 
now . Too much frame and other members in the way.

 When we did this it required weight on wheel for the measurements.
 What instructions did you use?

 I found an easy way to do this. While my bus was on the lift at the
 mechanics shop, I measured and adjusted the front end per Muir. This
 particular lift used the jack points so the suspension was hanging
 down. This gave me easy access to measure with a standard tape
 measure. I suppose you could lift your bus on a driveway or in your
 garage and do the same.
