Hi again,

Forgot to mention that the later trannies (think post-1967) had a  front seal 
around the hockey stick in the nose cone bushing, or it could be your  
earlier bushing is just worn out.
  That tapered fill plug should only be tightened to a snug  fit!!!  You can 
crack the tranny case if over torqued.  Just like you  can crack the engine 
case with the oil pressure sender.  Really doubt that  it is stuck due to 
corrosion, so the penetrating oil will probably not  help.  You will just have to 
figure out how to get a bigger lever, and make  sure you are turning it 
anti-Clockwise.
