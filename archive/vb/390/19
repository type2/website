Hi Corrie,

First, I would recommend you be open to any bus that is straight  
rather than setting your goal as high as the 21/23 window unless you  
have some serious cash. You can get into the "ground floor" for about  
5k. However those buses need help. I know, I have one in my garage.  
There is a 21 window in New Mexico on eBay. That should give an idea  
of where the market is right now.

Of course, you could get lucky at a show near you. Arrive early and  
tell the owners you are in the market - you might get a call  
afterwards. Clubs are also a good way of getting the word out. If you  
can make it down to Florida, there are some very good late season  
shows down there.

The nice thing about the hobby is that there is room for stock and  
custom. There are some good German parts left, but not many. Most  
parts are available from South America. You can tell the difference  
up close. You can't from more than a foot or two. If you put 5k into  
a paint job, then you'd probably want original quality parts.

In my opinion, the preferable route is to get the bus on the road and  
enjoy it first, then spend your spare time looking for ways to pimp  
it up. I should have done it that way but didn't and have about 15  
years of not driving the bus behind me.
