Subject: RPM/ Gearing??

I put a new rancho trans in bus 63 bus.  Rebuilt the small nut reduction
boxes.  The trans is suppose to be a freeway flyer.

I put in a tach today, and went for a drive.

(-at-) 60 mph   approx 3500RPM
(-at-) 65mph    approx 4000RPM

I was hoping to get closer to 70mph (-at-)3500rpm.

What should be my top highway cruising RPM on my stock 1600.

If I change to Big Nut Reduction boxes will that get me closer to 70mph?
