The "standard" name for this tool is probably 'bearing puller' or maybe
'slide hammer'.  Usually the puller has a screw that you turn with a
wrench to pull the bearing off (like the picture in the Bentley manual),
while the slide hammer has a handle that you slide against a stop very
firmly to move the bearing.  The main part of either of these tools are
the small "fingers" that fit down inside the bearing and pull on the
bearing.

Some auto parts stores will lend you a bearing puller or slide hammer
either for free or at low cost.  Usually you have to pay a fee to get
the tool, then the store gives you your money back when you bring the
tool back to the store.  If you show the person at the store the picture
in the Bentley manual, he or she will probably be able to get you the
right tool.
