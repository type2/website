> If you belive that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery than the SO42 is the style you want. Ez, Sundial, KK, and Riviera all based their kits on that set-up. The SO69 and SO44 are nice kits as well.

maybe its because you dont see them as much but i just love an so44

and benchseat bays like doc rics so69 with small pop top or uncle daves
SO69 with dormobile top are very cool layouts.

*	We don't bother much about keeping our West's as neet or closer as
        possible to the original look of a Westfalias, we prefer the
        utility and the personnality of the vehicule.
