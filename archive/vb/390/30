Subject: New Stock Steering Wheel

I need help finding a steering wheel.
Stock for a early bus with horn button.

I bought one from Flat 4 about 2 years ago.

It was real nice. I bought it through Mooneyes.

I have now been told that they don't have them anymore.

Can anyone help me with another source?

Thanks
