Subject: 25mm pre-heat hose

Hi all,

Are there any online sources for the paper 25mm carb pre-heat hose?  I
found the 'stovepipe' tin at the local wrecking yard this weekend and
would like to hook it up, but I haven't been able to find the hose.
Besides the tin, I also scored a '70 bus owner's manual, SVDA
distributor, new-ish Brosol 30/31, and an alternator-style fuel pump.
One of most productive trips for VW parts I've had in a long time.

-Tristan
