Corrie,

I would go with Conrad, Get a bus and get it on the road (fix all the major 
mechanicals). Enjoy driving and going to the meets, swaps and shows. When 
you are ready, then get it restored. I gave my bus over to ISP West and they 
had it for about a year. The body work looks great. They do a lot of removal 
of rusty metal and welding in of new. Again, see the Met Wiz. He takes 
complete basket cases and resurects them. Amazing. Keep in mind that when 
you purchase a bus, trust nothing on it until you inspect it. There are many 
shade tree mechanics and knuckleheads out there that will take any short cut 
to save a buck. Get a bus that has not been restored if you can.
