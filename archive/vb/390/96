Sounds like you found it.  You might check to see if the wiring harness
to the switch has too little slack and is pulling on the switch all the
time.  Or maybe you've got some large item in the parcel tray that
slides around and tugs on the switch wires.  A few strategic zip ties
might help keep some slack on the harness to the switch and/or keep the
harness from getting snagged and pulled on.

Thanks for letting us know what the problem was!  This helps calibrate
the advice to the next guy.
