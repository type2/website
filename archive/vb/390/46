If this happens pretty dependably every time you crank the wheel, pull
all the fuses out (remember where they go) and see if it still happens.
(Yes, your Bus will start and run with no fuses installed, but you
shouldn't drive it that way as you will have no brake lights.)  If it
still dies with all the fuses out, then it's most likely in the ignition
switch; if it stops dying then the problem is likely in the horn or the
turn signal switch.

If it's in the horn or turn signal switch, put all the fuses back.
Crawl under the Bus and make sure both wires are disconnected at the
horn and taped up separately so they can't touch each other or anything
under the Bus.  If that doesn't stop it dying, then it's probably in the
turn signal switch; I can give further directions if you tell me what
year Bus you have.

If you're going to do a lot of cranking on the steering wheel while
chasing this, it might be good to park on gravel, or to put the front
end of the Bus up on jack stands.  If you can't do this, try to find
an empty parking lot somewhere so you can be rolling when you crank
the wheel.  The idea is that steering boxes aren't cheap, so don't put
a lot of stress on yours (by turning the wheels with the Bus not moving)
if you don't have to.
