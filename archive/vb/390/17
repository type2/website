Hi im presently on the rear outer bearing job of my 65' Split. What kind of 
special can i use to remove this bearing ? In the Bentley he said to use the 
VW 241 with the VW202K where can i purchase it ? Or what tool can do the 
same job ? Ive tried to make one like he said in the MUIR but im not vere 
good to do one. Thx
