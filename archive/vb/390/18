Subject: RE: [VB] clutch pedal zerk fitting

I think iunderstand the basics of this, but canyou install one where there
is  a bushing? I imagine I'd need to drill through the frame and also the
bushing, right?

I have installed two different types of zerk fittings. None of them at
the clutch pedal assembly, but in other applications. Basically the
first step in both is to dissemble the part. The next is drill a hole
where you want to install the zerk. The third step depends on what sort
of zerk you have. Some allow you to use a small holder and just hammer
it into the hole. Others require you to tap the hole and then the zerk
threads into them. HTH
