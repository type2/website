Subject: Re: Bay Z-bed in a 60

Is a z-bed the westy camper bed, or the optional fold-down rear seat from a passenger van?

Regardless, I put the bed from a 71 westy in my 65 splitty, baselining from the point where the bed frame mounts to the front edge of the rear shelf.  Instead of using the original seat bottom box, though, I built a full-width box out of 3/4" plywood.  I used existing foam from the 71.

(I replaced the bed in the 71 with a full-width unit from a weekender.)
