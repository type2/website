All -

My entire life I have always wanted a VW Van and am finally beginning
the journey.  I am looking for any advice I can find. There seems to be
two schools of thought here: restore to original and just get the thing
running. I have not found as much information on line as I was hoping. I
am in Mississippi (but am a California transplant)  and am searching the
country for a body with straight sides. I have found several on eBay
that are already restored however I really want to do this myself. I
would really really like a 21 window(?) but know that finding a frame
for that model is slim.

My husband is very familiar with VW air cooled engines, we have a paint
and body man already as well as an interior guy.  Now all I need is a
frame. What is the thought about after market parts? Sacrilege?  What
publications would you recommend? Are there advantages to joining the
National Club?

Any assistance needed,
