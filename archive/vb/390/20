Subject: Re: [VB] clutch pedal zerk fitting

Hi,

Take a look at your king pin assemblies. There are zerk fittings on those. 
That should give you an idea of what you need to do. They are sort of like 
the clutch pedal in that you have a rotating part around a shaft.

I just crawled under my bus to see what your are tackin about. Yes, you 
would need to drill a clearance hole thru the frame large enough for your 
grease gun nozzle, about 1/2 to 5/8 inch. Then a hole thru the bushing tube 
and bushing. Be sure to deburr the hole on the inside. Rather than drilling, 
I would vote for taking the whole bushing assembly apart, cleaning the H E 
double hockey sticks out of it and then greasing with fresh moly-sulfide 
wheel bearing grease and reassembly. Should last many years unless you drive 
under water a lot.

I know I have a So- Cal bus, but I have never greased my pedal until the 
restoration 2-1/2 years ago. I also have a pan under my pedals. Probly keeps 
out some of the dirt.
