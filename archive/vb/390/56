Subject: Fw: [VB] Most functional Camper Floor Plan

Hey Michel - I'm adding a Dorper top to my 60. A Dorper top is a small 
pop-top that goes straight up (they were a B.C. conversion company) - its 
bigger than a mid-60's westy pop-top - maybe 4" wider and 4" longer ... or 
so - yet the roof line of the bus remains visible. I have two Dorper tops 
and a small westy top - the westy top is complete with hinges etc... If you 
know anyone interested in a complete small westy top - complete with springs 
etc.. let me know. I pretty much have everything for that top and was going 
to use it ... but ... I like the Dorper.

I have a 2/3 middle seat from a 65 - I was considering putting seats back in 
but ... I have an SO 69 behind the bench seat cabinet - I was not sure if I 
would use it or not ... now I think I will. I have a 62 Devon that I've been 
harvesting stuff off of ... I'm not sure what I'll use from the Devon - 
light for sure but what else ... I don't know.

From what I can see - the most functional camper interior for a bench seat 
bus has got to be the SO 44 or SO 69 floor plan - I like the idea of a full 
width z-bed so I"m using a z-bed from a 74.  I'm putting new arborite on the 
SO 69 behind the bench seat cabinet - I'm thinking about mounting a propane 
tank underneath - maybe throw in a propex heater and the SO 69 stove. hmmmm 
I'll build an SO 44 style over the z-bed cabinet as it appears bigger than 
the SO 69 cabinet.

Everything is subject to change - I do have a middle seat from a 65 and the 
upholstery is mint - as well - I have the rear seat from my 60 ... and my 78 
westy is ... maybe a 9 out of 10 so  I have a good camper ....I'll send you 
some pics of things
