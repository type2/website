well, what you do is print out a copy of your wiring diagram and realise the 
little lines on the diagram mean physical wires in the bus. The bus itself is 
not in the wiring diagram, as you cant see wires through the bus.  this way 
when you are holding a wire at one en of the bus you see on the diagram where 
it connects to elsewhere in the bus.   Get yr milk crate, sit behind bus with 
engine lid open and with your flashlight and find where those wires come 
from.   Find the base colour that the splice is attached to.  write that on 
masking tape and label the wires.   
I 'd check to see how good those splices are- make sure the wires and good.  
I toss toss wrong coloured wire and splice in colour coordinated wire, but 
that's just me being anal.

You will have to make a generator to regulator harness. if you dont have one. 
 It is a thick red wire and a thinner green wire.   You crimp the connectors 
on the end- the generator  connectors says D+ and DF I think- it is what is 
written on your gen.  take the wire to match the same connection on the 
regulator.

 hahaahahahah...yeah...i definitely understand wiring diagrams. no, i 
 understand some of them, a little bit, but it would be easier to see a 
 real life picture instead of a perfectly segmented color coordinated 
 (which isnt how mine is AT ALL) totally fictional diagram of something 
 that does'nt relate to my wiring at all. they should draw the wiring 
 diagram all tangled up and un matched colors with electrical tape 
 holding connections together and wires tied to the deck lid.
