Try removing a broken 8mm stud with 10 threads engaged in the insert and
one thread showing outside that needs 18-foot pounds of torque to turn.  No
way I could do it!

If the studs unscrew from the case, the same motion will tighten them in
the head if the nuts are prevented from turning by safety wire.  Since the
threads are the same on both ends there is nothing to cause this to occur.
