I did a tune-up today and received bad bad news.  3000 miles ago =
compression test results were about 110 lbs all the way around.  Now #3 =
is at 90 lbs and 1, 2, and 4 are all at 100.  I guess problems are in =
the stars.  So what should I do?  Should I follow the Idiot Book and =
pour diesel in the carb and run it for 1000 mi. and do another test?  =
What does that entail - do I just pull of my air cleaner and pout the =
diesel in the carb?  Should I be squirting oil in the spark plug holes =
and see if that changes the reading? If so ... how much?  I don't have a =
clue what size my P & C's are so I don't know what rings I'd have to =
order - should I be considering replacing my rings? I'm assuming =
replacing rings would not be that hard - do I need any special tools? =
What else should I consider doing?  My motor is from a 61 beetle - =
probably the right one to put in a 60 -  so I guess it was 1192 cc when =
it had the original P&C's?  The guy who put it in said it was 1400 cc so =
what size P&C's would I have?

I've pulled my motor and transmission a couple of times in the past but =
I have never done anything to the motor.  I was hoping I could find a =
1600 sp that I could attempt to rebuild in the future so I could have a =
spare motor.  Anyone have any leads in a 1600 sp that needs to be =
rebuilt?  I suppose most of the 'stuff' on my engine would fit on a 1600 =
sp - like the 28 pict and the generator etc.. Would the engine tin be =
the same?  Heater boxes?  Exhaust?  I know nothink.

Good news is the five screws that hold the top of my carb onto the =
bottom were all loose.  I have been smelling a bit of gas for a while =
and today I notice a bit of gas around the carb - so I pulled it off and =
.. 3 of those screws were loose - hopefully tightening them will fix the =
gas smell.
