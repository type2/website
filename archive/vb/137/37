Hi Paul,
211 953 235 Switch - Emergency light relay up to Chassi No. 215 190 000

111 953 235 Switch - Emergency light from Chassi No. 216 000 001 to 216 190 
000

111 953 235 A  Switch - Emergency light from Chassi No. 217 000 001
Which has 111 953 243 A spindle with knob (12 V) 8/66 - 043 grey black.  
We have a couple of these.

From dealing with a fellow a while back there seems to be a EURO flasher 
system that has more then only two wires on the switch though!

The images from Karl look like 111 953 505 switch that we have a couple of 
and can not figure when or what they were installed in.
