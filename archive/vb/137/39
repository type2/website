It is confusing, but some folks say that there is a difference between
Beetlemex and other suppliers.  The gist is that the Beetlemex engines
are
assembled from parts in the aftermarket while the engines sold by Ronnie
are factory-built engines in the original VW-Audi cartons.

Of course, no "turnkey" engines will be available from VW de Mexico, as
their production is fuel injected these days.  Apparently the FI parts are
rather pricey.
