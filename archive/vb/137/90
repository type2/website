Looking for someone(s) going from CO to FL who can pick up some paint =
for me at KCW - Home of the Barndoor, Double door, sunroof Panel and the =
guys who did the bodywork on my Binz.  Need to have you pick up some =
paint and transport it out to FL for me if you can.  Shipping paint =
seems to be something of a logistics exercise.

Thanks in advance,
Dan
