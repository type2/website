Subject: RE: [VB] Emergency light switch and knob on a 66 bus

Hi Paul,
The mushroom shaped knob is probably for a 67 Emergency Flasher.  The 66
knob is completely red, whereas the 67 knob has only a red center, with the
rest of the knob being mushroom shaped, which matches all of the other 67
knobs, and it is black surrounding the red insert.
