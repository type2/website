You're trying to retrofit US-spec hazard flashers onto a Euro-spec Bus,
correct?  You might know this already, but you're also going to nee
a relay or two to make this work as well.

The pilot light flashes with the hazards.  This is true for the style
you have (bulb in switch knob) and the earlier style (separate bulb
housing next to speedometer).

These are the connections for the headlight dimmer (dipper) relay.
31 is a ground - it goes to a ground terminal on the windshield
wiper switch.  S goes to the coil of the relay.  You pull the stalk
up to switch beams, instead of using a floor-mounted switch as in
older Buses.

The diagrams on vintagebus.com seem to show that the US and Euro Buses
got these at approximately the same time.  Compare:
