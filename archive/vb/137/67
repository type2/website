Think I have now tracked down a knob and light switch, been comparing =
=3D
the US
wiring diagram and the non US diagram and am a bit confused by something =
=3D
in
the US diagram.
On the indicator stalk there are two connections - 31 and S - what are
these?  There appears to be nothing similar on the non US diagram.

Thanks
Paul
