The idiot book said to install the studs with vise grips 
(in the procedures) or use a double nut (in know how)
the installer i remember had a socket body with one or 
three spirals in the body that mated to the threads on the the stud.

OT related question

In a head nut re-torque scenario, would a stud loose at the case  
not torque all the way to the 23 ft/lbs spec due to friction of the
nut against the head and threads on the head end?

Hence, to coin a phrase, a "floater" stud that 
torques to spec cold, but when stressed by normal operating temps.
and loads, goes out of spec due to loosing at the case end of the 
stud?

Maybe a dab of blue loctite would help? I hear that red loctite 
is permanent and you would have been SOL with your broken stud,
George. 

So,-

Could I pre-test this blue loctite bond to 23 ft/lbs, 
with my handy soon-to-be-acquired stud installer
or a poor boy double nut setup  
and my "lighter" torque wrench?
