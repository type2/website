Subject: [VB] Accelerator pedal linkage question


All,

I've been playing around with my pedals some more.  The original goal
was to free up the accelerator pedal - it tended to stick at about 1/4
throttle.  I just had my carb re-bushed, so it is a little stiffer, but
if I take the throttle cable off the carb, the return spring can always
snap it closed.  Also, my accelerator cable tube at the engine was
missing the grommet at the firewall, so it could have been sliding
around and jamming things up.  I fixed that.

Matt, this will be of no use to you whatsoever. For your problem something
seems out of whack somewhere in the dimensions underneath, the tolerances
shouldn't be that close on the moving parts and sliding cable.

One of the things I had a buddy of mine do for dune buggy carbs that the
Florence clubs ran back in the 80's was to weld a 3/16 aluminum ring around
the top of the carb throat, allowing enough neck for the air cleaner, but
also providing a thicker return spring mount for the throttle lever. It was
a tricky weld because the aluminum of the carbs is almost potmetal, but when
finished you could almost mount a garage door spring on it!

As for my 67 SC, my throttle assembly, pedal, cable, return spring, and
throttle plate all seem to be loose as a goose and moving freely.
