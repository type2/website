From what I understand, the "Freeway Flyer" Trannys
just have a higher ring and pinion gear. So each gear
comes out a bit higher...i think it's not too hard for
someone good with tranny skills to take your stock
gearbox, and turn it into a freeway flyer. anyone know
who does this? am i totally wrong?
