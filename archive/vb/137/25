Subject: Re: [VB] Hard to shift into first and second??

Try pushing down (like reverse) and then doing 1st/2nd.  After I put a tranny 
in my 61 it was fine- then suddenly it seemed that 1st/2nd were gone!  II 
adjusted the shifting (loosen 13mm bolts at bottom of shift stick and shift 
the plate shightly) and it is fine.
