Subject: AS type Engine does not start, although ignition, and carburation are fine


Who might have an idea of what I might have missed to start the engine of my 
67 microbus deluxe.The engine was silent for 5 years, but was running when 
stopped 5 years ago. Ignition was prepared as per guidelines of technical 
review, and the carburator (1 single progressiv) was cleaned with air 
pressure.
At the end, engine simply does not want to start, although if I put gasoline 
straight in cylinder...
If anyone has an idea of what is wrong...I would appreciate some help on 
that one.
