The difficulty encountered when powdercoating pop-out window frames
involves the Faraday Cage Effect, wherein the charged powder is repelled
from reflecting surfaces. The inner / outer channels have a hard time receiving
powder. This is a technical application problem , especially on the outer
channel,
where the edge is rolled. They will assemble with the same normal difficulty.
