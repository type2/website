Subject: "icepick" door handles

The "icepick" style door handles on my beloved bus flop outward as I drive, the
doors don't pop open but it creates a minor impalement hazard to pedestrians and
cyclists. I think perhaps there was some kind of spring in there that is now
unsprung, but would someone please enlighten me before I take something apart
that I might have a hard time getting back together again...? And the part that
is missing or broken or worn, is a replacement available?

Other notes: The ratwagen turned 39 this weekend, climbed a 9,628 foot pass, 26%
grade in second gear. No better bus, that's what I say.
