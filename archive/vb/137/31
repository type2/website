Subject: Re: [VB] Emergency light switch and knob on a 66 bus


> Does anyone have a digital photo, or could take a digital photo of the
emergency light knob on a 66 bus?

> I want to fit one to my UK bus, but a 66 switch is different to pre 66, and
any switch is rare in the UK.

> Could someone also recommend any 2nd hand car part dealers in the US that
may be able to supply with a switch and knob - I think the part number of the
switch body is 111 953 235 or the same suffixed by an A on a 67.
