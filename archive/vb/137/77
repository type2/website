Step 1:  Put down the pipe
Step 2:  Use liberal amounts of visine to clear your vision
Step 3:  Take a look at the bottom of any and every vintage bus e-mail
Step 4:  Follow the directions you see at the bottom of any and every
vintage bus e-mail
Step 5:  Once unsub'd sell your computer and VWs for "alternative medicine"

Step 6:  Imbibe as much as you want and babble on about how mean and old we
are...
