Subject: Re: [VB] Emergency light switch and knob on a 66 bus

The pics I took are of the 111 953 505 switch I took out of my 66 hardtop
deluxe, vin 246126769. As far as I know, it is original.

Funny thing is, this knob does not light up like my 67 does. But the parts
book says 111 953 241 is the swtich spindle with knob (6v) for switch 111 953
235 which makes it sound like it lights up.

In the 63-67 Bentley, E-1 page 13, shows the wiring diagram. J4 is the hazard
switch. It only shows 2 wires and the case is grounded. No bulb filament.
Page 17 is 67, J5 is the hazard switch. In the center of J5 is K8, emergency
light warning lamp.

I don't believe the parts book. I believe I have the correct switch.
