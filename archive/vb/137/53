Subject: Re: [VB] Emergency light switch and knob on a 66 bus

not sure if it's clear in those photos, but the plastic is sort of 
transulenscent, and you can un/screw the end of the knob off to install the 
light bulb that blinks with the hazard lights.

 > Does anyone have a digital photo, or could take a digital photo of the
 emergency light knob on a 66 bus? - I think the part number of the
 switch body is 111 953 235 or the same suffixed by an A on a 67.
