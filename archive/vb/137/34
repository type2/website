Luckily, the stud screwed right into the case insert.  If it didn't, I
wouldn't have been able to get the old one out without extreme measures!

I don't think that studs should be torqued into the case.  They should be
screwed nearly to the bottom of their hole, but not bottomed out.  My
thought is that bottoming the stud will cock it sideways which will yield
odd streses when it is torqued from the head end.

That's just my theory, but it seems sound.

BTW, I now have 1200 miles through Utah, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and
Nevada since the stud replacement and things seem to
be holding together.  400 miles more to home!
