Steering damper is of an unknown age and may be original.  Steering

I think I know what the first two paragraphs are telling me -
swing lever pin and bushings time - but if anyone can confirm or
deny, I would appreciate it.  Thanks!<<<

The play in the swing lever pin bushings, steering box or drag link
would show up as play in the steering wheel.  Your description of the
bus "loading up"  sounds like a problem I had with my '67.  Any bump in
the road would redirect me a bit.  I pulled the steering damper off and
it slid in and out like an old pirate's telescope.  Put on a new one and
solved the problem.  It's far simpler to unbolt one end of the damper
and slide the piston in and out to check it to be sure than any other
fix down there.
