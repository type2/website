Don't mean to cramp your style or anything, but this list is for those who
are interested in vintage bus/truck and want to share knowledge and poke fun
good naturedly once in awhile. I would tone down the threats because that
will get you nixed off the list automatically based on your IP address, they
don't have to know who you are.

Calm down, go adjust your valves, change your oil, and set up your
.009/34-PICT 3 properly. By then we can all get back to civilized
conversation and less, if not all, name calling.
