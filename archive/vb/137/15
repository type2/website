Sorry to all about the bad URL. It was the same story that someone else (on the
Vanagon list) mentioned and gave this link... 
http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/14/travel/ROAD.html?8hpib

Let's hope that one works. Nothing like broadcasting to the world and realizing
that you lead everyone astray... "My bad" as the kids say.
