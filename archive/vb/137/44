I had this article forwarded to me and the URL worked. I biffed it once, caught
some flack from various angles and then noticed that someone else on one of the
lists included an URL under a different subject title. Stupid me, I didn't
check it. I "assumed" that that one must have worked. HONK, not!
I gave up after that. It was a passing thought that turned into a PITA and an
embarrassment. Was not that big of a deal...
Sorry for a hassle.
