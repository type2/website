Subject: fuel line shut off

i think it was posted a whil ago about putting a fuel line shut-off-similar
to the reserve switch on earlier buses. I have a '65 kombi. I would like to
install some type of in-line fuel shut off valve so that i can sut off the
gas when i go to disengage the engine. where can you get these?

thanks
