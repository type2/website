Subject: RE: [VB] Emergency light switch and knob on a 66 bus

Hi Susan,
These switches and knobs are not being re-manufactured.  I think they are a
one-year only switch/knob, as the 67 emergency flasher know is
mushroom-shaped with a red insert that flashes on and off.

You can find the switches/knobs at swap meets, and occasionally on
thesamba.com.

Good luck,
Ed
