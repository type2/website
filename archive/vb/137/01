Subject: air cleaners

hey if you all are using the stock air cleaner, where did you get it? i 
cant find this anywherre. if you have one for sale let me know. I'm not 
sure if i want to get one of those weber cleaners, I need my bus for 
long long long long long long long long long long hauls. not 
performance. unless there's a certain weber model that works just as 
good or better as stock
