No, you'll still get the same friction between the threads, either at the
head (most likely, due to the number of threads in bearing) or at the
case.

If it loosens, it will probably do so at the nut end.  the lower nuts are
lubricated by engine oil, while the case inserts are not.

Even blue would have left me stranded.  If loctite were so good, the
factory would have used it.  They chose not to for a very good reason, so
that the parts could be disassembled later on without undue difficulty.

If something is so critical that loctite is considered, then it is better
to safety-wire the nut or bolt head.  Safety wire doesn't loosen and the
fastener can still be easily removed.
