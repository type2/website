Cool, I will give the carbs a check.  Do you know how I go about
checking the carbs for dirt?  I have heard of cleaning the bowls but at
risk of getting Jay Porta excited could you or someone else explain how
this is done on Kads?  Thanks again.

sounds like maybe some dirt plugged up a carb jet. of course I couldnt
discount perhaps the dizzy advance sticking. Probably quite a few other
possibilities.
