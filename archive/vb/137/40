It is confusing, but some folks say that there is a difference between
Beetlemex and other suppliers.  The gist is that the Beetlemex engines
are
assembled from parts in the aftermarket while the engines sold by Ronnie
are factory-built engines in the original VW-Audi cartons.

Of course, no "turnkey" engines will be available from VW de Mexico, as
their production is fuel injected these days.  Apparently the FI parts are
rather pricey.

George,
getting back to the stud issue, I have never had any problems with off the
shelf local purchase VW replacement studs or mail order. Mexico uses studs
from three sources, Germany, Argentina (which are German built Steel mills),
and the etheral "third source" which no one has been able to pin point for
sure. The German and Argentinan steel is essentually the same since they are
both German owned companies. I am assuming, (stepping out on a limb here),
that the third source is Japanese NEC owned subsidary that supplies the
Asian market. To date, I have not seen any large scale USA made metric studs
as prolific as the others. I have only been building engines for twenty five
years so I could have missed something though. There are a couple of
startups in the last twenty years like Autocraft and SCAT/Centerline that
make their own, but it isn't clear where their raw material comes from.
