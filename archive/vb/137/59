Hi Matt,

I had the exact same problemo and went thru the same steps as you!  Finally
solved the problem when I noticed that the angle of the gas pedal was not
the proper angle to the vertical heater tube as in other buses that didn't
have the problem!  Somehow the pedal hinges which are spot welded to the
floor got bent and threw the proper angle for the accelerator rod out of
whack which made everything below stick at times.  Try and slightly twist
the pedal to be angled more towards the heater tube than away from it (if it
is)and see if that helps.

BTW the my bent pedal hinges eventually broke off from metal fatigue from
over bending back & forth so avoid bending it too much or plan on changing
out the whole pedal hinge in the future!!
