Subject: re: [VB] roof top tents

The VintageVW list was discussing rooftop tents:

Below are several URLS that apply to the subject. I have for some time thought
that this/these might be a killer option to "HAVING" to have a pop up camper or
expensive vintage Westy tents. I could see how these badboys could work well
with most any vintage of VW or other marques.
