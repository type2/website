The pics I took are of the 111 953 505 switch I took out of my 66 hardtop
deluxe, vin 246126769. As far as I know, it is original.

Funny thing is, this knob does not light up like my 67 does. But the parts
book says 111 953 241 is the swtich spindle with knob (6v) for switch 111
953
235 which makes it sound like it lights up.

In the 63-67 Bentley, E-1 page 13, shows the wiring diagram. J4 is the
hazard
switch. It only shows 2 wires and the case is grounded. No bulb filament.
Page 17 is 67, J5 is the hazard switch. In the center of J5 is K8, emergency
light warning lamp.

I don't believe the parts book. I believe I have the correct switch.

One of the things I've noticed about buying used VW's, any type, any year,
is that the owner's) believe they have an unlimited license to modify the
wiring any way the choose. At least that has been my experience with 5 bugs,
two buses, two trucks, one Vanagan, and one fastback.
