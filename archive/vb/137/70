Subject: Updated Dixe Bus Gathering

Hello All,
I have updated the web site for Dixie Bus Gathering.  I tried to hit all the
important areas, but I am sure I forgot something.

We will need everyone's help for the FMBC Breakfast Burrito. Please bring
your Coleman stove, skillets and utensils.  Pre cut veggies seem to be
easiest.  Bring eggs, cheese, sausage, tortillas, sour cream, hot sauce, or
maybe a little of everything.

T-Shirts are $15 per, and $3 more for the double X sizes.  Ordering deadline
will be July 25.  E-mail me your size.

If you need specific directions, you may e-mail me, or call Rustic Knolls at
740-397-9318.

I have received a couple of responses from those who intend to come.
REMEMBER, I am feeding the mass on Saturday evening, it will help me
immensely if I know how many to expect.

Respectfully,

Frank E Biffath III
