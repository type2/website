I liked your initial post - some people on this list do need to lighten up -
on the other hand it is always important to be respectful because you will
find most people will be respectful to you.  Give the list a chance and
smoke your pipe as much as you like.  You'll also find people will go to
great lengths to help you when you have a problem - so it's a good idea not
to alienate them by name calling.

good luck
