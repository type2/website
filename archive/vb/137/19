Subject: Swing lever looseness

All,

I decided I wasn't in enough trouble yet while playing under the Bus
so I looked at the swing lever.  I didn't have anyone else handy to
crank the wheel while I looked, so instead, I grabbed the swing arm
back at the tie rod ends and tried to push it up and down (wheels on
the ground).  The dust cap on the bottom of the swing lever pin moved
back and forth about 1 mm or so.

Also, when I drive it, it doesn't change lanes on its own, but I can 
feel the steering "loading up" on opposite sides from time to time.
In other words, it feels like the wheels are starting to go slightly
to the left on their own, and I feel it in the wheel, so I tweak the
wheel to the right.  It's not like the Bus is yet heading left, but
if I took my hands off the wheel, it seems like it would slowly drift
left.  It goes OK for a while and then I start to feel the wheels
heading to the right and I have to tweak it to the left.  Lather,
rinse, repeat.

I have brand new shocks all around, decent tires with correct air
pressure, the front beam is greased, and the link pins are adjusted.
Steering damper is of an unknown age and may be original.  Steering
box is original and full of gear oil.

I think I know what the first two paragraphs are telling me -
swing lever pin and bushings time - but if anyone can confirm or
deny, I would appreciate it.  Thanks!
