I don't know if my failure is any indication of a weakness in the Mexican
studs.  It might be simply a fluke.  I'm considering the
German stud replacement, but let's collect some data
before we cause a lot of folks to make a lot of replacements.  I have two
of these engines, one is a bug, one in a bus.  Several other listees also
have these engines and have had good luck with them.
