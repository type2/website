Nah
I use it on my carb studs. 
Never had a problem.
The on-line spec sheets seem about right as far a "breakaway torque"
with the upper range being ~18ft/lbs

Your safety-wire idea makes sense for the top nuts and should be easy
to do. The bottom ones would be harder to do with the rocker shafts
in the way. Besides, they can be re torqued with only the disassembly
of the valve covers and the rocker assembly.
