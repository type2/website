So does a 66 switch look like a 67 one, ie the knob flashes?  If not how do
you know that the lights are flashing?

My bus has been converted to 12v, and I am not too worried about the
originality of it, its just I really could do with emergency lights.  I have
one small knob like Karls photo for my headlights, and a grey black large
one for my wipers.

The switch I have got is the large mushroom type I think, I will post a
photo later on, but you are correct, it has many more than two connections -
so I don't really want to use this as it would mean too many wire
modifications.  The SSVC had an article about retro fitting a two wire
switch I think, so I want to use a two wire switch as it seemed pretty
simple.
