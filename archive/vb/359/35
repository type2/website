Nice story, Gene. Reminds me of the trips taken in the recent past with the wife and son in our old '68 fat chick Westy. Haven't done an adventerous trip in the '65 sunroof standard we have now but reading your account given me visions of crawling through the redwoods with that big, glorious top open and looking up into the green infinity.
