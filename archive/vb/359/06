Hi lake.show,
Good to hear!  At swap meets we have come across  stock pre-1971 oil coolers 
where the flattened cooling tubes have  been swelled to an "O" shape due to 
oil pressure over 80 PSI.  The air  flow through the cooler is drastically 
reduced, and the "O" shape creates an  eddy behind it reducing the cooling even 
more.  Not good!
