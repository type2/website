I used to have this compression guage:

4548406913&rd=1&ssPageName=WDVW

On the picture it is hard to read, but it looks like it says:

Approx. Cranking Speed Pressure

Compression Ratio - Pressure

8.0 -- 140 PSI
9.0 -- 160 PSI
10.0 - 180 PSI
11.0 - 200 PSI

Apparently dynamic ratios are considerably higher. On Richard's
suggestion, I found an interesting web site:

One of the calculators is an Otto Cycle calculator, and you get the
compression pressure from the compression ratio and several other
factors. Leaving them at default and only changing the CR, I came up
with compression PSI's well over 200 even for a modest 7.0.

 Is there a formula to convert the compression measured with a
 compression gauge into the CR ? It looks like 175 psi ~ 8.0 CR and
 120psi ~ 7.0CR
