Subject: Re: [VB] REAMER FOR FRONT END REBUILD

Hi Mitch,

Unless I'm missing out on something here, you don't need a reamer to
do the link pins.  The kit for your '67 should include new needle
bearings and steel bushings.  The bushings are actually outer races
for the needle bearings, and are already the correct size.  You use a
hydraulic press to push the old ones out and new ones in.

The swing lever pin bushings do need to be reamed, however.  You can
either rent a special reamer that allows you to do the new bushings
after they've been installed in the beam, or you can get a
15/16"-17/16" adjustable reamer (also known as 'size H') from Enco for
about $13 and ream them before they are pressed into the beam.

The king pin bushings would also need to be reamed, but since the king
pin may need to be ground undersize anyway, I'd leave those up to a
machinist.

I did the links, swing lever, drag link and tie rods all at once about
five years ago and it made a huge difference in the steering response.
 Just a little bit of play in each of the components can stack up to a
lot of play at the steering wheel.

Good luck,
Tristan
