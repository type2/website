Subject: re:speaking of oil

I don't get the anti-multi idea either...

Do our engines really run a lot hotter than a engine made today? I'm trying
to imagine these new cars with their 250+ HP engines running cooler then my
~60 hp engine.

I'm not trying to start an oil fight, I just don't understand that...

When I first got my bus-the PO instructed me on the use of straight 30 wt,
but then I had troubles starting in the winter, and tried the 10/30, and
I've also tried the 5/30. It is also difficult to get straight 30 wt around
here-most shops don't carry it. So for convenience sake I've been using
10/30 summer and 5/30 winter.

I haven't been in the VW hobby long enough to know what is going on with the
engine and the oil...maybe I'm doing it all wrong.
