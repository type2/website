Subject: link pin zerk won't take grease

this can't be good, I haven't tried to remove the zerk and check to see if 
its clogged.  Do the zerks clog? Do I need new/rebuilt link pins?  The bus 
is a 56' and the only place I have seen that has them is Wolfsburg West 
but not in stock.. What are my options?  Friend of mine 
claims to have NOS ones but he "will put them aside next time he runs in 
to them" not holding my breath on that.. Many things on front end have 
been rebuilt but I doubt these have.
looked around the library for info on link pins but didn't find any

thanks
