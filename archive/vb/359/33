Subject: Re: [VB] Doghouse additional oil cooler or not ?

Personally we dislike external coolers due to hoses that can go bad, and  
ruin an engine in seconds.  First check you have a 33, 34, or 35mm (inside  
measurement) wide cooling fan.  You might want to try a type 4 cooler  in modified 
dog house shroud, which is 40% bigger than the stock doghouse  cooler.  
Porsche generator pulley.  Clean out ALL casting flash in the  head fins.  Plus tach 
your engine to see where 1,500 & 3,000 RPMs are  at what MPHs.  You might 
just have a badly rebuilt tranny, resulting in  incorrect gearing.
