John,

To really know, you would have had to "cc" your heads and also let us know 
how much distance between the piston at TDC and the top of the 
cylinder....then you need to know the P&C volumes...The formula is out 
there...and there are even some interactive ones on the net if you look.

Generally, if the heads are "new" they will pretty much have a certain 
volume in them that will get you to around 7.2-7.5 CR.  Can't remember now 
if it is 54 or 57 cc's.  

If they are rebuilt, then you are on your own.  They could have been 
flycut to clean up the sealing surfaces one or more times.  Or they could 
have been flycut quite a bit in order to *raise* the compression ratio to 
a certain place.....and! they may not match each other at all...you may 
have one side flycut at .030 and the other side at .050.

When I did my last bug engine, I had them flycut about .100 in order to 
raise my compression ratio to 8:1.  That engine gets 175psi of compression 
in each cylinder....and yes, my gauge is a very good one and is "right".

Cheers, dave
