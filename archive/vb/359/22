Do the zerks clog?


Rob,

The grease inside the zerk and link pins tends to dry-up after awhile. I had that happen to my 67. I used a small screwdriver and brake cleaner to remove the dried grease through the zerk hole. It worked quite well. You will need to rotate the steering to get to all the dried grease located around the pins.
