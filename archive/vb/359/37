Matt,

I have the exact same behavior in my 'new' 59 Single Cab (6V).  And it all 
started after I removed the starter, replaced the bushing, put back the 
starter, and made sure to clean all connections.  Ever since I get the same 
"rowr...(pause)...rowr...(pause)...! r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-..." if I am lucky.  I 
had to push start the old fella the other day... stubborn mule.

I was just looking into the Hard Start Relay's today to see if that might 
help the situation and was going to post that question to this list for 
tribal knowledge.  So, thanks for bringing it up.  If you figure it out, or 
if any listee knows what the solution is, please share.

Exactly the same situation here...

Ditto again...
