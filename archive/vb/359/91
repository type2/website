My '87 16v GTI ran at 250F a lot during the AZ summer according to factory 
oil temp readout.  Temperatures in that range are not abnormal for a GTI. 
Water temp. was always within normal ranges.  I never had any trouble and I 
beat the crap out of that car.

From reading the flash point data on the link you posted:
http://www.repairfaq.org/filipg/AUTO/F_oil_facts.html#OILFACTS_006

The flash point of Castrol 20w/50 (as an example) is 440F.

So assuming I understood everything correctly, unless you have a point on 
your engine where the oil is hitting 440F (maybe head temp?), the oil is not 
breaking down.  440F is a pretty high head temp.
