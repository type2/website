I'd say that if you feel the engine needs more intake area during some
stage of its operation, just making a permanent hole somewhere (with
appropriate screen/mesh against debris) would be the simplest thing to
do.  On the other hand, you might be worried about the hole letting hot
air into the engine compartment during other stages of operation.

If I was going to make an automatic trap door, I would look into the
pressure switches used in building HVAC applications.  This is
essentially a big enclosed diaphragm (4"-6"/10-15 cm diameter) with a
pin in the middle that pushes a microswitch.  One side of the diaphragm
has a tube spout and the other is, I think, open to the atmosphere.  You
can get these that switch on very small pressure differences, like
fractions of 1 psi.  You might have to mount the switch outside the
engine compartment and run the tube to the engine compartment to get it
to work.  Anyway, the microswitch would drive a solenoid, a power door
lock motor, or even an official hot-rod linear actuator to open and
close the trap door for the air.
