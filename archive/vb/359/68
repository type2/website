From: "Scott Stothers":

 The question I have is who makes/carries 30Wt oil anymore? It's just like
 trying to find gear oil around here.....
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you serious?

ALL the oil packagers; Castrol, Valvoline, Quaker, Pennzoil, etc do 30 wt. 
All of the above do 40 wt except Castrol.

If you can't find it, blame that on the store you go to!!!
