Subject: Re: [VB] link pin zerk won't take grease

you can take the zerk off with a wrench (dunno what size), and poke a  pointy 
thing in it to clean it out, and pump grease through it.   see  what's 
clogging under the fitting...reinsert fitting.  It's probably not  the zerk, but the 
crusty hardened old grease in the link area
 Adjust your link pins (VW says to do this every 3K or is it 6K  miles)  Try 
pumping grease in while you loosen the link pin up a  bit.  Don't know how?... 
it's in your Idiot Book and your Bentley.   Real easy too.  While the bus is 
jacked up, check the spindles for wear ala  Muir.
 
if the links are stuck and don't want to turn after you loosened the pinch  
bolts, you need to take them apart and inspect them, possibly (probably ?)  
replace them.   Or since spares are hard to find, clean them up,  manual grease 
them with clean fresh grease,  and reinstall them if they  aren't rusted to 
bits with the needles falling out of the needle bearings.
 
grease your suspension every 3K miles (1200 if you drive on bad roads) to  
keep these parts in good shape.  
 
grease is good. 
 your bus loves grease. 
yum grease yum
 
In the Seattle area there is a guy called Wiley driving around a late 67  
Westy repainted cheaply green/white with a non westy pop top on it with  
extremely worn out links/kings.  Give him extra room on the road if you see  him.

this  can't be good, I haven't tried to remove the zerk and check to see if 
its  clogged.  Do the zerks clog? Do I need new/rebuilt link pins?  The  bus 
is a 56' and the only place I have seen that has them is Wolfsburg  West 
but not in stock.. What are my options?  Friend of mine  
claims to have NOS ones but he "will put them aside next time he runs in  
to them" not holding my breath on that.. Many things on front end have  
been rebuilt but I doubt these have.
looked around the library for info  on link pins but didn't find any

thanks
