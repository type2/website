You did it right, though, by buying a camper for the first one and still
having it when you bought the second one.  Having the camper is not
strictly necessary; in a pinch, anything other than a pickup will
probably work, as long as you have a blanket or some old carpet or
something for the floor.  (If you're short, even a pickup will work.)
The main idea here is that if you have a Bus that is reasonably watertight
(or can be made so quickly with a roll of duct tape), you can always sleep
in it if you can't sleep in the house... :)
