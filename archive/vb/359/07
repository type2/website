Subject: painting a bus w/ a pattern

So I've been thinking of ways to let everyone know how insane I am. I
already drive a bus everyday and enjoy it. But it lacks something,
perhaps a paint job? yes, yes......that's it. I shall paint my bus!

So anyway, as my family are huge Auburn fans we have just about
decided to paint it in a tiger stripe theme. I'm going to use either a
base/clear coat or just single stage urethane, but that's not really
the concern yet. I'm trying to come up with a good way to mask off the
stripes well. One idea I came up with is to take a picture of a tiger
stripe pattern and use a slide projector to shine it on the bus when
masking off to give me a guide line, does anyone have any additional
input or suggestions? I have also had quite a time trying to find a
good tiger stripe pattern online. Does anyone know of a good digital
pattern of a tiger stripe? TIA.
