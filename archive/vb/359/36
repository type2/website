Matt,

Been there, done that.  Check your starter bushing before you go any
further!! Had those exact symptoms and needed a new bushing.

 And hey, if you just busted off the stud, why not drill and tap a hole and
put in a bolt to hold the ring lug. I think a 10-32 might work if not a
1/4-20. Save lots of dough.

Chris
