That 113M dizzy is vacuum advance ONLY.

Ported vacuum, the vacuum used for vacuum advances,
goes AWAY on full throttle. So in reality, at 3500
rpms you have zero advance. You are at initial base
timing because the spring overcomes no vacuum. It will
be 7.5 BTDC if that is where you set it.

 I am getting a bit confused here. OldVolksHome.com
 list the 113-905-205M 
 (which I have) as originating in a 1968
 Bug/Bus/Pickup. It also states 
 that the dizzy has a full advance of 32-35 degrees.
 I have read on 
 VintageBus that buses should be set to no more than
 30 degrees full 
 advance. My question is, while some folks are
 setting this dizzy to 7.5 
 btc, and oldvolkshome specifies 0 btc, shouldn't I
 set the dizzy 2-5 
 degrees ATC? That would give me 30 BTC at full
 advance. Am I seeing something wrong?
