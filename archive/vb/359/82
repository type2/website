Subject: Re: [VB] front wheels...link pins

I have two ideas about this
 
1) bent drag link.  the drag link does have a normal bend in   it.  When my 
61 got hit, a result was that the turn radius was much sharper  to one side 
than before, and wider on the other side.   The drag link  got bent.  I replaced 
it, and voila.. back to normal.   comparing  the old to the new there was a 
marked difference.
 
2)  the stop bolt on the spindle could be broken off.   It  is supposed to 
have a fat pointy hex shaped end that goes to a point.   these do get broken.

it's #46 in the diagram

Well  with that recent talk of link pins and zerk fittings, I was reminded  to
lube my front end. Although I have never adjusted my link pins, and am  still
having trouble figuring out the diagrams in the Muir book. I'll check  the
Bentley today, hopefully it will explain it better. Maybe some pics  in
there.

I was wondering about my front end, which has always  seemed a little weird
to me-so I started examining it more closely...I  noticed when I turn the
steering wheel all the way to the left-the driver's  side wheel turns a LOT
more than the passenger side wheel, almost 90  degrees. Kind of like my left
side is more flexible. This is with the bus  jacked up in the air.

When I turn the wheel to the right-I don't notice  a great discrepancy.


I believe this explains the rubbed spot on my  frame-where the wheel probably
hits it when I take a sharp turn. 

I  can't believe I have driven this long like this-got to fix it, but I  have
no idea what is supposed to be adjusted.

Advice  please...thanks...
