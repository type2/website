Subject: Re: [VB] Doghouse additional oil cooler or not ?

I run a HD Pump with the berg cover and an HP1 filter. Granted you have to run oil lines but it's less than 5' total. and I've never had one fail in 12 years. I do change them every 3-4 years.  My filter is located under the battery tray on the drivers side out of harms way. I also have a stock muffler.
In How to Hot Rod VW Engines, Ford is quoted as saying adding a oil filter reduces engine wear 66%!

That's a tempting item to buy. So, they are not designed to operate with stock mufflers? Seems odd. When you say the neck I assume you are talking about the section that projects out from the cover and then leads to the base of the oil filter?
