I'm using Castrol 5-50 Syntec. One of the oil engineering docs posted
to the list said that NO oil has low enough viscosity for proper
lubrication at startup, and thus said the lowest first number possible
is desirable, specifically recommending 0-40. I use the 50 because any
less does not give me the desired 10 psi per 1000 rpm when hot.

 So, since some synthetics may have little or no
 polymers, it should be okay to use Mobil 1 15W-40, for
 example?
