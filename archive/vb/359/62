i've been thinking about that! here are my specs:  measured deck 
height: 0.064"  spacer size: 0.07"  total: 0.134"  CR: 6.93.1  but 
boy, it NEVER pings :)

i think i have some .03 spacers about... puts the CR at 7.5:1 if 
nothing else changes.

yeah, i  really learned the deck height stuff AFTER i'd already run 
out of money for more headwork  :p  i was annoyed that the head man 
who charged $$ to do a good job on em never asked about it when 
discussing the motor. the crazy homeless guy next door clued me in! 
(nick sharkey, if any one knew him... was allegedly a big name in vw 
circles in the late 60s/early 70s at iverson's).

  i need to reread my tech books this weekend...................
