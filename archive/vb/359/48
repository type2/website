That's a tempting item to buy. So, they are not designed to operate with stock mufflers? Seems odd. When you say the neck I assume you are talking about the section that projects out from the cover and then leads to the base of the oil filter?

Claude's Buggies so far, makes the only decent present day oil filter/pump:

To work with our engines with stock muffler we have to cut the neck of the 
cover, angle it down slightly, weld back together, and redrill the oil 
passages back out. Result is no hoses to go bad.
