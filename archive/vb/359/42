I had all these problems mentioned with my Rat Double Cab after installing 
a new engine. I swapped starters, replaced bushing, even got an autostick 
starter. Charged battery replaced ground strap, ect. Did all the testing of 
wires and nothing seemed wrong. I was really bummed and tired of messing 
with it. I got one of the Bosch Hard Start Relay Kits from Bus Depot for 
like $15.00 and now the truck starts like it never has. Have to say even 
though I'd rather hunt what the problem is down, the Hard Start Relay fixed 
it where my bus starts when I need it to now. So it was successful for me.
