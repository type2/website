Subject: Sightings: Lufthansa Web site

All,

Bus content:

Lufthansa has a Web site celebrating their 50th anniversary.
They have a timeline with pictures, and many of the pictures
of aircraft also feature Buses (split, bay, and I think
even a Vanagon) and Bugs.

It's all in Flash so I can't give direct links, but start
at http://50.lufthansa.com/php/chronik.php?lang=en .  At
the lower right of the caption area, there are several
small white squares.  The first one on the right is yellow,
and if you wait a bit, the second one turns yellow and the
picture changes, and so on.  You can also click on any of
the squares to go directly to that picture.  To go to the
next year, click on the year in the list right below the
white/yellow squares.

Here's what I saw...

1956  3rd square from right  Pickup
1958  8th square from right  Kombi
1963  3rd square from right  Bug
1964  2nd square from right  Bug
1968  4th square from right  Kombi (Split)
1970  5th square from right  Kombi?  (Split)
  Check out the tail lights!
1972  Only square            72 Bugs
1970  3rd square from right  Kombi? (Bay)
1977  1st square from right  Kombi? (Bay)
  Lower right-hand corner
1983  3rd square from right  Vanagons?
  Lower left-hand corner

Off-topic question: Have any of the listees ever jumped
out of a perfectly good (or otherwise) airplane?  I am
pondering doing such a thing.  Please reply directly to
me (not the lists) at mattroberds(-at-)cox.net .

Thanks!

Matt Roberds
