Subject: adjusting link pin interval

According to Bentley if you are pre-Aug '65 it is eery 3000 miles, from
august '65 forward it is every 6000 miles.

-Kevin 


Was writ:
"Adjust your link pins (VW says to do this every 3K or is it 6K  miles)  Try
pumping grease in while you loosen the link pin up a  bit.  Don't know
how?...it's in your Idiot Book and your Bentley.   Real easy too.  While the
bus is jacked up, check the spindles for wear ala  Muir."
