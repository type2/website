From: "john d":

I'm sure you can get 30 wt at crappy.

I haven't been following this thread - so why is a single wt better than a
multi wt?  I just run 20/50 summer and 5/30 spring and fall - what's wrong
with that?

Oh boy, it did not take long for an oil FART to start once the door was opened!!

Go here: http://www.repairfaq.org/filipg/AUTO/F_oil_facts.html#OILFACTS_004
and read section 4.

There was another website on the Triumph Registry called Lubrication Note from Redline but the link now
requires a password. In it, the polymer breakdown temp was 212 degrees. Once you passed that temp, the
multi-grade reverted back to its' base weight. 10-40 became 10, 20-50 became 20.
