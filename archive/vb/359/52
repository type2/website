Hey Matt The bushing is 12.5mm or just under 1/2 inch  ID   All you have to 
do is tapp it and keep tapping after it bottoms out and the bushing will come 
right out. To install tape the bushing to a socket that just fits the out side 
edge of the bushing and using a long extension tap it into place lightly with 
a hammer . Be sure to put a little grease on the starter shaft when 
reinstalling it  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
