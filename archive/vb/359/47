Do you know any website that discusses type4 oil cooler  conversion ? I did 
not find much about it in the archives. Does it involve lots  of hacking ?  << 
 
Hi Arnaud,
Here below are some past posts about the type 4 cooler mods:

As for full flow filtration.  We consider it a must!  We have  seen rod 
bearings with only 20,000 miles on them and all the  nasty scratches in them from 
metal shavings in the  oil.  Then seen rod bearings 10,000 miles later with 
filtration, and  NO scratches from metal shavings.  Just a slight polish to the  
bearings.
 
  Claude's Buggies so far, makes the only decent present day  oil filter/pump:

  To work with our engines with stock muffler we have to cut the neck  of the 
cover, angle it down slightly, weld back together, and redrill the oil  
passages back out.  Result is no hoses to go bad.
  The problem with your later bus is you have the 1968-71 rear engine  hanger 
tube.  To use the oil filter/pump you would need to either have your  stock 
bar modified or fabricate a totally new one.
