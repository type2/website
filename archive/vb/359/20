Subject: re:link pin won't take grease

I belive those are replaceable, I imagine any decent FLAPS should either
have zerks in stock, or be able to get them to you.

I don't know the size, and there are probably more than one size.

Then again, if you take it off, you can probably see what is clogging it,
clean it out, and re-install.
