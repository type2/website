Hi E&B,

This is a question that has bothered me for quite some time now. Why
do oil pressures get up to 80 pounds when the oil pressure relief
valve is designed to relieve at much lower pressure, what is it, 30
pounds or so?

My bus doesn't do 80, but I see it way above the 60 pound mark on a
cold morning till it warms up.

 At swap meets we have come across  stock pre-1971 oil coolers
 where the flattened cooling tubes have  been swelled to an "O" shape due to
 oil pressure over 80 PSI.  The air  flow through the cooler is drastically
 reduced, and the "O" shape creates an  eddy behind it reducing the cooling
even
 more.  Not good!
