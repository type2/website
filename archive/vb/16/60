 What kind of place would we go to for this type of work?  Can anyone

I second that except this rack i have is a 66-67 poptop westy rack.  I have 
to replace the cracked wood but wonder if someone can straighten the legs.  
They arent buckeled, just a little tweaked.  Maybe cheaper than replacing the 
legs?
