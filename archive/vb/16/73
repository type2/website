I came in kinda late on this thread but here's my opinion, I had one bus
come in from the left coast supposedly a 2 year old resto, Yea Rite , the
damn newspaper in the drivers side rocker was dated 88, the nose and both
rear corners, both doglegs , both cargo doors ,the skylight area on the
drivers side,were all sculpted from filler, window screen wire,wire mesh,
and damn spray foam, so don't even get me started that just because its from
the left coast that it's rite, thats bullchit. Now before you flame my
skinny a**, let me say there is alot of good quality work done there,and
alot of good buses coming from there, but there's always shysters all over
fixing to put the wiener to some unsuspecting buyer. SO BEWARE form either
coast.

As for the amount of work done bring our east coast stuff back to life , i
think i know more about that anyone on the east coast. I've saved some rare
ones. If its got a good re-paint job and bubbles some where i wonder whats
under the paint, work did rite or something thats gonna bite me in the a**
when i start taking it down.  Usually it gets me in the rear. Had me a rusty
bus untouched then i know what i'm up against for the most part. My .02
cents, flame suit on. later
