Subject: Euro Tails on U.S. Bus?

Hey All,

Came across some repro euro tail lights (complete assemblies, lenses, and 
seals) for real cheap. I've been having tail light gremlims while running 
headlights for sometime now.  After comparing euro and US spec wiring 
diagrams, I noticed the euro bus' have a diff turn signal switch.  Any ideas 
how to make these euro tails work on a 66 US spec bus?  I don't mind if both 
bulbs flash when the signal on.  I can get the signal to work w/ no probs 
but can't get a brake/tail light to happen.  I tried to just wire up the 
bottom brake/tail light like a US light to no avail.  The repro has a wire 
for the top turn bulb and 2 wires to the bottom brake/tail bulb, none are 
black indicating a ground and there is no screw or terminal on the bucket 
for the ground like the US spec.  I'm currently scanning the archives with 
nothing yet.

TIA,

Eric
