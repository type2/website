If anyone is interested, I can get the European caution signs pretty cheap.  
These are square signs with reflectors in the corners and red and white 
stripes across at a diagonal.  These are mandatory in some European countries 
to mark a bike rack or load hanging off your vehicle.  You see these most 
often on bike racks.  Signs are 50 x 50 cm.

You can get these in aluminum or lightweight plastic.  I would likely order 
the plastic signs.

Cost would be around $10 ea. plus shipping.  P-mail if interested.  If I can 
get at least 10 people interested, I'll add them to the next order.
