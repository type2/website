Subject: Trying to make it to Jerome :(

The 66 is taking WAY more time than i thought. Little things keep ending up 
into big things and stuffs just takin too long.  I have been to jerome for 
the last 5 years, maybe 4 and it looks like I may not make it there this year 
:((((

Im trying desperately to get this bus done but it looks like i need at least 
another week to get it on the road  :(

Ok im gonna go keep working on it.
