Subject: Oil cooler spacers?

Upon removing the oil cooler from the "new to us" 1600 SP type 1 
engine, I noticed a strange spacer. It was made of rubber similar to 
a cooler seal and went over the upright stud in between the oil 
cooler (non-doghouse) and the engine case. I have never seen this 
before. Has anybody else seen this before?

Thanks, Rocky
