Interesting...Eric&Barb referring to themselves in 3rd
person.  It's almost like another person, some kind of
"union" between the two is now responding to queries
from the list...or a hired hand doing the responses
for them.  Eric&Barb = "The Rock"?

Paul (I know it's not Friday, but I just thought it
was funny now)
