Subject: Bus Shirts

Hi all,

I concocted some bus shirts and various other paraphernalia which are for
sale through this company called cafepress.

All the proceeds from the "vintage bus list member" products I plan to
donate to the list fund, so it's all for the good of the group.

Anyway you can check them out at magnobeam.com/vb_store.html

Also thanks to Andy {www.type2.com/~andy} for letting me "acquire
inspiration" from his originals.

btw is the triangle supposed to go the other way?  Or is there a standard
direction?
