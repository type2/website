Subject: Front Turn Signals 62-67

I have some spending money and would like to secure some NOS or VERY nice
front turn signal lenses, "Fried Eggs" for the 64 Single Cab.

If you have some and would like to sell please drop me a line.

Any one boght the ones ISP West shows on ebay? It suppose to be a close repo
with the Hella Logo? Comments?

Thanks

Meredith
