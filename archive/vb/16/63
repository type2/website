Subject: Friday in Hawaii yet?

Hi Real Bus People    Hey, What I want to know is when
do we all get invited to Hawaii?....There is a Listee
over there and I got a feeling it's time for a beach
party....."Splitties in Hawaii"...Speaking of
"Splitty" is there a listee on here from SLO town with
a SC?..And what ever happened to Eric Rupp?...While
cruising thru the super rich hood here in SLO town I
noticed a bay window,purple and white parked  in that
area!I am available for live on site
caretaker/security duties....there or Hawaii...Have a
great long Labor day weekend bus people!!!  Mark
