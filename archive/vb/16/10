  What we will do is leave it as a travel day and will do a count at the
show of who wants to stay and we could have a Sunday night camp-out either
at the site or at one of our houses, depending on the number.
  I have room for 20 or more BUSES at my house, even with all my buses
there.

Even in Arizona??? :)

So, would you guys extend the show to Monday as well? Or leave that as a
travel day for those few of us that don't live in Havasu? Not that it
matters to me, I'll be there either way. That's a fun one. It's somewhere
between a show and a campout and a swap. It has the best of all three
without the negative parts of any.
