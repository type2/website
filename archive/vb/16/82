Subject: Re: [VB] little red light

That there is the hazard indicator light. It is present on every 65 I have
ever seen, and some 64's. I haven't any idea if it went earlier than that,
but it sure doesn't belong on a 67. If'n you want it anyway, you  would want
to connect it to the red light in your hazard light knob.
