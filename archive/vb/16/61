Pete,
   I noticed the same thing on my dual dellorto setup. Seems that at idle 
one of the cylinders gulps up all the air and gas from the manifold and 
leaves just a bit for the neighbor cylinder's firing. To test, drive around 
the block with one wire off, put it back on and see if there's a difference 
in power. You'll have to look at the idle circuit air and gas metering to 
smooth out a rough idle. You shouldn't have to fiddle too much with 'em 
after they're dialed in, but then it's easier to fiddle after you know how 
to set them up. My biggest problem is with linkage getting loose, hope the 
Webers are better than the CB Perf. setup!
