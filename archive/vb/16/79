Subject: little red light

List,

There is a little red light between speedometer and fuel gauge on some split 
buses what is it for ? , my 67 single cab doesnt have it , I have one and 
want to install that but where should I hook it up ? . I am improving the 
dash I have installed an original clock and an old vdo tach , thats why I 
want that little red light ..

thanks ,
Eren
