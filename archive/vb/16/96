Subject: San Diego (or Orange County) to Jerome?

Hi all,

Are there any San Diego or Orange County listees that are going to Jerome
that could do a favor? VW Howard might be able to bring a motor from Havasu
that I need. I'm looking for someone to grab it for me if possible. I'm
located in Northern San Diego county, so I could just as easily pick it up
in Orange County as I could in San Diego.

Thanks!

Scott
