If you have an air leak on one side it will cause the problem you
describe. Make sure the bolts are all tight between the carbs and the
manifolds and the manifolds and the heads. Any damage to the gaskets can
also let enough air leak in to cause this. I've seen intake gaskets fail
just because they had a little wrinkle in them before they were
installed.

Dual carbs aren't that much trouble once you get them right. I never
touch mine except to check the balance at tune-up time.
