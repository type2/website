A one time thing?

Ellis sez:
I was thrilled <and over whelmed> with the response to
an unplanned contest meant to spark up the list in
it's Summer doldrums. It would be unfair to foist a
contest on the list on a regular basis. 
The head-cheeses of the list <admins> deserve a break
and should be given the courtesy to prepare and
organize appropriately for future fun. I apologize for
not thinking of this prior to my spontaneous posting
of the "rules". It was partly an experiment in
sociology to see how folks reacted to me creating
restrictions out of thin air and imposing them on the
list. <Question Authority!>
At this juncture, I subjugate myself to the "power and
authority" of the list admins. Prizes to the winners
will be sent out this weekend.
To me, a contest like that could be handled off line
to a specially dedicated address and very occasionally
too much of a good thing becomes a bore.
-In the meantime my computer is FUBAR again- vidcard
me thinks. Am accessing from work on limited basis.

A contest on a busy Holiday weekend is not a good idea
in my opinion.

I am the weakest link, -goodbye.
