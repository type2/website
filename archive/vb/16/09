Even in Arizona??? :)

So, would you guys extend the show to Monday as well? Or leave that as a
travel day for those few of us that don't live in Havasu? Not that it
matters to me, I'll be there either way. That's a fun one. It's somewhere
between a show and a campout and a swap. It has the best of all three
without the negative parts of any.
