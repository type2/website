that is where there should be the name of the colours written.  They changed 
the styles of m code plates a couple times, the later ones get colour codes.  
  your letters stand for Grey/ Green.   Germans spell green gru:n, umlaut 
also can be written by an e after the vowel, this gruen.

thinks VW called them  seagull grey,  mango green.  Caramel brown with white 
piping interior.
