Subject: Bumpers need transport

Is anyone from Colorado going to Jerome or Busses and
Balloons?  I just bought some bumpers from a fellow in
Boulder and need them in Albuquerque some day.  He's
going to leave them with my brother-in-law's sisters
house, but I don't know when I'm getting back up
there.  One green chile dinner for the person who can
pick them up and get them here!

Thanks,

JP
