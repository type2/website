Subject: rough idle

Help Please,
I have a 1600 DP with dual Webers (bought new about 2 months ago). It idles
rough. Cylinders 3 & 4 seem to be not firing all that well. If I pull the
plug wires one at a time from the dizzy, you can't tell much difference on 3
& 4, but you can tell alot of difference on 1 and 2. I replaced the plugs
and wires last night. It didn't seem to make improvement at all. My
question, could the carb on that side not be supplying the right mixture of
fuel and thereby making those two cylinders not fire correctly?? What else
can I look for? The engine has only 2700 miles since rebuild. Any help or
suggestions would be helpful.

Thanks List, yall's the greatest !!

p.s. Should I expect to always be adjusting stuff with dual carbs on a daily
driver? If so, should I convert back to a single factory carb? Thanks
