Hi all......

New to the list, just bought a 1967 Bus today.  It needs some work (both 
rockers are bad of course!), but isn't too bad.  Needs an engine and 
such, but the horn beeps so everything must be okay with it (haha).  I 
can't seem to find any internet site that has a complete VIN listing for 
a bus.  Does anyone know of a site I could go to?

Thanks in advance to anyone who can help.
