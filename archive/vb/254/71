Subject: Ohio & surrounding states VW group, A shameless plug!

Hey Y'all,
It's been a while since we've done this, and I'm sure
there have been a lot of new people sign up to the T2
& VB list since the last time, so here goes again:
I want to inform anyone living in the Ohio Valley
region (Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, West Virginia,
Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan, etc.) about a
regional VW Group called The Ohio Valley Tribe of the
Full Moon Bus Club.
Since Ray Nemo started this group (1 year ago?) we
have grown to more than 60 members and have formed a
GREAT network of enthusiasts\nuts for regional VW
information as well as just a lot of "B.S.-ing" and
fun stuff. So if you live anywhere near us (or even if
you don't!) please check us out and join our group,
here is our homepage:
http://autos.groups.yahoo.com/group/ohiovalleytribe/
Come see us and experience that legendary Midwest
hospitality first hand!

Peace, John Baker
