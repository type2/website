There's a guy in my neighborhood that runs a pair of 31 PICT's on adapter
plates on ICT manifolds (Baby Dell's) along with a dual 34 PICT linkage from
CB Performance in his 69 Ghias. Pretty snappy. And he is using DP heads.

67 Single Cab, DP 1641cc 34 PICT-3
71 Trike 1776cc Dual T-4 34 PDSIT-3
VolksAir 1585cc 31 PICT
