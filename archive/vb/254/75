My '56 Kombi has a small bracket that it slips into located on the front kick 
panel by the drivers door.  It is shaped to accept the male end of the key.  
It is held on the panel by one of the screws that normally hold the panel on.  
I don't know if this is stock or an add on, but my panels are original.  When 
I purchased my bus it was there.
