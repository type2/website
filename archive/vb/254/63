I _think_ they were installed by the dealer so I don't know if there's
one "correct" place.  I often see them installed to one side or the
other of the ash tray in the center top of the dash.

If you look at the bottom side of the parcel tray, you'll see a couple
of about 3/4" holes in the rib in front of it, several inches on either
side of the heater duct.  This is where the inspection light socket
goes in an Ambulance, but would be rather inconvenient for a lighter.
