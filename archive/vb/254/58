Billy,
 
 Early 70's bugs came with alternators from the factory and you are correct in pointing out that splits never did. However a lot of people have converted their upright fan AC Vw's from a generator to an alternator, usually using a Bosch (50-55amps, I think). 
 
There is one available for around $200 that is a 75 amp model. A little pricey if you ask me!
