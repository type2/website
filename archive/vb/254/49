Subject: Re: [VB] Hazard lights on the '60 DC?

Yup, it's big. U.S. required hazard lights and turn signal lights before Europe 
required them. 




Seems like the oil or gen light should be that big. Guess you could run the oil 
or gen light to it. Buzzer too, so you'd get that new car sound when you turn 
the ignition on.
