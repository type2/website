Hi Kevin,
IRS is Independent Rear Suspension and all AC VWs had this feature from 1938 
onward.  CV (Constant Velocity Joints) jointed IRS tends to hold the road 
better in extreme turns due to having two pivoting points in each of the axles is 
better at keeping the tire tread level with the pavement.  Because IRS swing 
axles only have one pivot point in each axle the rear tires can and will tend 
to ride more on the edge/corners of the tread in extreme cornering causing loss 
of traction and probable spin out of the VW.
