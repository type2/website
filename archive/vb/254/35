I don't think they were standard until '63.  The '50-'62 Bentley reprint
doesn't mention them, but the '63-'67 one does.  They first show up on
the '63 USA-model wiring diagram.

On my '64, the switch is in the lip of the dash on the right side of the
headlight switch.  There is a red warning light for it on the dash between
the speedo pod and the fuel gauge.
