my understanding is that your bus would not have a church key holder as a stock item.  apparently the engineers at vw thought that the door pockets were the best place to keep church keys.  when smooth, pocketless door panels were made the engineers thought a holder was called for.  my '56 truck has pockets in the door panels for the key (i usually hang it off the turn signal arm cuz i like to listen to it clink when i drive) and my '62 panel has a church key holder and smooth door panels.
