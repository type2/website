Hi Tom,
The bug rims/tires will work for the short term, but get some more bus rims 
and rated tires ASAP to replace those.  205/75R15s are a good tire and will 
work well if they have a wieght load rating of at least 1525 Lbs..  You might 
want to check out the Cooper 195/82R15s that are alot higher rated load rating 
and 6 ply.  Plus these tires are a tad narrower and taller so they will fit into 
the rear pre-1962-1/2 lower and tighter rear wheel wells easier and give you 
a bit higher top MPH than the 205s.
