Seems everybody wants to get into the action.
When are they ever going to learn that if the front page loads slow
............... they go.
With a load time this guy has he must be selling DSL and Cable connect.
I might try for a look see again at some point but right now I'd like to
see fewer graphics and more simple links to usable features.
While you're at it guys get rid of that giant field of BLUE, I don't need
to get screamed at.
