Just an FYI, I've developed a detector for the stuff for use in basements 
where it tends to accumulate.  Harry might be interested in using it in his 
DC in the slight chance that his system springs an unknown leak.  It can be 
battery powered much like the Carbon Monoxide detectors.   Right now, I'm 
working on a redesign so that the unit has sensors for both DMHO and CO on 
the same board.  It would be a nice addition for our vintage busses in 
detecting when we have a leak in our exhaust or in the Houck Awesome 
Cooling System.
