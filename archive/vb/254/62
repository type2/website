Pull it and take it apart...the cover over the windings comes off just
like a valve cover and you can check out the brushes, etc.  See if you
can spin the armature with your fingers - maybe the grease in the gearbox
is too old and thick, or maybe the shaft is rusted.  The gearbox comes
apart too, but make sure you find _all_ the small parts - there's a tiny
shim or thrust washer on one of the shafts.
