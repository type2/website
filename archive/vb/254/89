Subject: Free Dead Tickets for Tomorrow

Friday Topic
------------

Anyone out there in bus-land want to go to the Dead show in Camden, NJ 
tomorrow (Saturday)?  My friends from Brooklyn just decided not go, so 
there are three tickets sitting at their house just waiting for someone to 
pick them up.  

So, if you want one or more FREE tickets to the Dead show in Camden and 
you're willing to pick them up in Brooklyn, mail me at: tommy(-at-)roadtrip.net

Also, I have two tickets for sale (face-value) in Washington DC.  I'd also 
be willing to meet someone at the show and make a hand-off there.

Bus content:  Sadly, I will not be driving my bus to the show.  My 
tail-lights went out on the way home from the Merriweather show -- water 
in the fuse box, i suspect -- so I decided to pull the windshield and fix 
that rust and seal once and for all (i hope).  Sad, but thems the breaks I 
guess.  I'd love to hop a ride in a bus up or hang out with other volks in 
the parking lot, as appropriate.

cheers,
