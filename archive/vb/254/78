It also opens the engine lid up on pre '66 models. 
As far as the name sake goes I have heard many a prayer directed directly into those "doors" after the little key opens them and I have heard the "lords" name used quite a few times when they are opened. Although the later is usually used in the most unfriendly of ways........
