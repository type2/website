Subject: RE: [VB] WCM door seals fit

  The cargo door seal kit consist of 9 pieces. 1 door gets 4, the other door
gets 3 and then the body gets the other 2.
  You have to cut the backsides of the seals to clear the hinge indentations
on the doors and to clear the bar catches on the body. Not doing this will
cause the doors to bind and be hard to close. The seals will settle in after
a while (that's why I tell people to install the seals during body work, so
the will be compressed by the time you paint)
  OG seals already have this cuts in them and would be cost prohibitive to
try and make them the same today.

Hey everybody,

the d.p.o. of the 65 kombi left me some "cargo door seals" in the bus in
bundle with a WCM tag and p/n on them. 

test fitted a few of them yesterday, and my doors don't close no matter how
I lay them in.

any tips?
