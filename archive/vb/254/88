Subject: Re: church key

Someone asked why this thing is called a "church key".  That's just slang for any big key, like the large keys used to unlock those huge ornate doors 
on old churches.

The kind of bottle opener that has a loop on the end (looks a lot like a bus church key) is also commonly referred to as a church key -- and by 
extension, any bottle opener.  Probably originally from the resemblance to the large keys and reinforced by the irony of drinking vs. church, as in 
"Well, it's nearly noon on Sunday.  Time to open up the church."  Or perhaps real church keys are handy for opening bottles.

I suspect the etymology went something like "real church key" --> "bottle opener that looks like a church key" --> "bus engine lid / gas flap tool that 
resembles a bottle opener that looks like a church key"
