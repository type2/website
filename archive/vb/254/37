   Back in the early 80's when I was restoring 356 Porsche's we had a car
come in for a chassis detail. Upon inspection we found the floors hollow
sounding. These floors had been replaced 3 or so years previous. I got
permission from the owner to use the ice pick test and upon doing so the ice
pick went through the floors. Upon installation the company that did it (yes
por 15 has been around for over 20 years) coated both sides of the floor
with the product. After removal of the floor we found that somewhere during
it's life he chipped the floor (bottom side) and moisture started to creep
in. The floor had RUSTED out between the layers of Por 15. Moral of the
story is that Por 15 is a great product, but don't expect it to be the God
send of rust prevention, it is not a CURE ALL and proper maintenance needs
to be followed as with any other paint job.
  How many out there have had Por 15 or any like product (there are many out
there) on their vehicles that they still own for more then a couple years?

Ronnie

ps. I have nothing against Por 15, I have used it over 20 years. Just want
people to know there are alternative products that are as good or better for
less money.

Cal Grant has written much about POR 15 to this list.  Looking up Cal's 
POR 15 "sermons" in the archives will give a lot of useful info on this 
material!   Gary Gibson
