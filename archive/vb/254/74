Oy,

I expected to hear something like that.
So the seals are rectangulare in cross section and on one long side of the cross section, there are two rounded edges. 
I assume this is the front (facing out) of the seal and the flat long side goes in the channels on the bus?

Also, do seals go all the way around the cargo doors and all the way around the opening on the bus?
Seems like I have a funky number of seals.

thanks,

Billy

Had to push those buggers in like crazy to get the square rods in.  Once in, I left the doors closed all winter and the the doors and jam creased the seals in so that now they close. PITA.
