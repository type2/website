I use Dihydrogen Monoxide to keep cool in my VW. Seriously, why cool the whole 
interior when the passenger is too hot? My DC has a portable device that removes 
heat from me and puts it in an ice chest. When it's absorbed as much as it can, 
I "recharge" the two 2 liter water bottles in my freezer. So I'm personally 
water-cooled in my air-cooled truck.
