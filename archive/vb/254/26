Subject: Re: [VB] POR15 thoughts/opinions

Have you used POR 15?
Is it just like it, or similar?
Does it dry to a rock hard finish like POR 15 (i.e. can't be beat off with a
hammer? I've tried)
I trust your input Ronnie, and if you say it is, then I'll buy some and try
it.
I'm REALLY hooked on POR, but yes the price is kinda high if this is the
same stuff.
Also in 3 years, I've never seen rust pop through my POR stuff that's been
in the weather, have you seen this kind of results from the Chassis Saver?

POR= $31 quart
Chassis Saver = $23.75 quart

Thanks
