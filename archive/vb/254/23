Another option to POR 15 is Chassis Saver, call 1-800-922-9981, been around
longer then POR 15 (they probaly copied it). It only comes in black, no
bells and whistles or other fo fo marketing gimmics and is about 1/3 or so
the cost of POR 15. The semi truck industry has been using it for years to
protect the truck chassis from road salt and other inclimate conditions,
they just don't market it heavily outside the trucking industry.

 1.Any thoughts on this product?

I love it, and have yet had anything rust through after I POR'd it.  Some of
my stuff sits out in the rain, and is over 3 years old.

2. What kind of surface prep is required of a rusty spot you want to POR?

Wirebrush any loose particles off.  Bare metal not necessary, nor desired.
Just no loose grime or oil.

Secondly, once your surface has been PORed will primer adhere to it?
I've painted right over it with no surface prep, but don't know how it will
hold up in weather as all of the pieces I've done are not exposed.  I do
know primer adheres better if sprayed in about 2-3 hours after your final
POR coat.  I've never bought, nor used the primer that POR sells to coat
their product.

Also, POR can be used to fill small holes.  They make some that comes in a
toothpaste type tube.


WEAR GLOVES!  and don't get it on your skin.  Or you will be wearing POR
until it wears off.

In general, it IS almost as good as sliced bread.  Those that tell you
different probably have not used it yet, or put it on oily/dirty surfaces.
