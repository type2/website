Subject: Anyone have a nose FS?


I need a lower nose - from the headlights down - for
the '55 single cab.  Prefer straight and dry, of course.

Since nobody seems to want to buy it, I'm going to go 
ahead and clean it up and fix the nose and front floors, 
then maybe paint and logo it to match the panel (hey, 
I have 3 quarts of that yellow left!)
