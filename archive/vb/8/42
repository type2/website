Subject: Re: [VB] OK...Try it again....

    My 67 Deluxe got its name Brutus when I started working on it. It had
been stripped of all its goodies (interior, beltline, bumpers, etc...). When
I checked the wiring out it had been splice with Band Aids, Duck Tape,
Scotch tape, and just plan old bare wire. It also had the drivers side panel
replace from the belt line down.

    Brutus is its name for all the bad times he has had and he was tough
enough to stick it out until I could buy him and put him back on the road. I
guess it was one of those busses that got lucky and not crushed or cut
apart. Brutus is one of Volkswagens last split window busses they made.
There was only two weeks left in production before they started making the
68 year so I feel lucky in having it because it is one of the last of its
kind to be built.
