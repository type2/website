Subject: Re: [VB] The name game & wives

I know a guy who has had 3 wives.
He calls them b1, b2 and "Sweetheart". ;-P


My Sweetheart's '67 Westy is named "Celeste"
-Named after the Celestial Seasons tea and making fun
of the perceived VW connection to all of the hippy
dippy New-aged crystal hugging crowd.

Ex'63 EZ camper was named "Smiley" because it was
purchased with a smiley face sticker on the nose
instead of a VW symbol.

Ex'54 Barndoor/camper/ambo was called "The Dad Bus" by
our family in honor of Jon/John Jacobsen the previous
owner. Other bus friends called it the barnambulator.
Guess which one stuck.
