My '66 is "SmartyBus".  I have no idea why, but when my 2 and half year old son (who by the way LOVES my buses) saw it he simply stated "That's SmartyBus". Of course, this name stuck.  Upon reflection, my wife belives that I told my son to "Come see my new bus" and that some how his 2.5 year old brain twisted this statement into "SmartyBus". So that's been the name since.
