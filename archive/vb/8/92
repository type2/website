Subject: Turner Falls campout in Oklahoma?

Howdy,
  Do any of you Texas/OK bus folks know anything about a Turner Falls bus 
event/campout at Turner Falls, Okla. sometimes in September?  I heard about 
it but never got the details.  The guy I talked to said last year they had a 
mess of buses and expected more this year.  I think its an annual memorial 
thing for a bus guy who died a few years ago.  I'd appreciate any 
information anyone could offer.
  Speaking of Texas and September, September 15 is Bug Swarm at the ballpark 
in Arlington and September 24th is the Ennis Big Bug Shootout. Several of 
the list members from VintageVW meet at Bardwell Lake the day before for a 
campout (Saturday the 23rd).  JP showed up from Albuquerque last time and we 
had a great time around the campfire.  If anyone wants more details, let me 
know.
