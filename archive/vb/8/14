Subject: Sunroof Cover Installation

I am putting on a new sunroof cover and need to position the aluminum bows
before I attach the cover. Does any one have the dimensions to position the
bows. The old cover was too trashed to use as a locator and I don't have a
headliner, but plan to eventually put one in and don't want to buy a second
cover. Thanks for any advise.

Paul
