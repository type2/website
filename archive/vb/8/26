Subject: Re: [VB] Score! jealous-lever shock rebuilders?

Hi All,

I have a good friend that is a hydraulics expert... he is planning on rebuilding my
original steering dampner....  I haven't seen a set of the old lever shocks but I'm sure
my friend could rebuild them.  $250 a pair might be reasonable pending on what really is
involved.  I know my steering dampner should run me around ~200 since he has to cut it
open on the lathe, re-do the seals, pack it, and then re weld it (or what ever the
procedure...) anyway, 4-6 hours isn't abnormal to rebuild a fluid piston assembly which is
what these all are.  If anyone is interested in this, I can talk to him and we can go
further.... 

Restoration is always more expensive than replacement... !
