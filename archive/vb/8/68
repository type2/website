I have never been big on names and all my cars do not
have them.  I usually prefer descriptive names to
common names, for instance my 99 New Beetle in the
comsic green looks like a big phlegmglobber so I call 
it the "Lugeywagen" and the Packard is yellow/black so
I call it the "Bumblebee".  Perhaps if I had a brown
car I would call it the "Dingleberry".  Lucily none of
my ACVWs have names yet.
