Heres my 2 cents worth after trip today:

Bus:   1966
Production Date: 16 D
M Codes: 430 B42 080 108
Delivery: TE
Model/Finish: 2312
Color: 523506
Chassis #: 6076093

VW MAHAG Munchen Tel.459 51 tag on side by ft door

No motor,missing pop top,sink,rest of interior all there,original
paint,needs body work(dents no rust)and glass

Price:  "Haul it away and take all the extra junk too"

Have the perfect 14 year old kid in mind who has been wanting a split,
walkthru poptop westy to restore. This should take him about 2 years to do
and have it ready for his 16th birthday. Will contact his dad Mon . and will
give him Ellis's number on Tues.
