Subject: Seeking Glen Swanson! all help needed

Have been seeking Glen Swanson, formerly of this email
list for some time now. Was last known to be on work
assignment/residing in Denmark. I have been attempting
to return a major favor and have been unable to locate
him. Timing and logistics of returned favor have not
worked out in the past and wish to complete Karmic
favor flave (cycle). Need to clear things hanging on
my line.

Please fwd current email/phone/snail mail address if
you know him.

Thank you/danke/tak/tack sa mycket/takk/Kiitos/Mahalo,
