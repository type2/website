Somebody said cats should have 2-3 names...

'63 DoubleCab - The Truck, OB (for orange bus)
'65 21w Deluxe - The Deluxe, Green/White
'66 Camper - The Camper, Dansbus

Other thoughts on names & naming... some surnames are based on occupations,=
 Baker, Cook, Brewer, Fletcher, etc. Some on relative, Davidson, O'Conner, =
etc. So some suggestions for names... Grinder, Slowpoke, Hauler, Dusty, =
Bounder, etc.=20
