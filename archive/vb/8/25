Subject: Buses On The River, FOOD LIST, and finale

Alright ya'll!

I'll be taking emails until about noon, tommorrow, the 17th.  After that, I'll be in Unicoi County
setting up a tent.  :)

All grocery and food list items can be purchased within a couple of miles from the campground. 
This will keep everyone from having to keep items cool in transit.  Food coolers/fridges can be
plugged up to electrical hookups.

The water level is definitely seasonally high, but we're NOT washed out.  Also, our camping area
is well above water line and dry.  Kayakers will find the river to be quick! :)

There will be a BOtheR exclusive CASE BURNING - the plans are to let it flame in the river!  It
should be a fun site.  Heck, you should come just to see that!
__________________________
There are bath/shower houses, shade, food, good people, the Nolichucky River, the Appalachian
Trail, and a real good camping spot to boot!  Come early, come late - just don't sit at home! 
Buses On The River should suit the fancy of any one.

See ya there,
Travis
