  for which year bus?  the later ones had the folding Golde handle, the 64? 
 and earlier the non folding handle, which I believe is the same as a bug 
 Golde handle.   Then again, can't you just use a rear cargo door inside 
 handle?  the guy I sold the last sunroof handle I had said that that is what 
 he had on his sunroof at the time.  If you use one of those early chrome 
 inner cargo door handles it'll look okay.
