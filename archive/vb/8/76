  Dione and Kenny are bus people; although they are not on the list.  They
are friends of mine and live about a mile from me.  Any kind of virus sent
through them was an accident I assure you.  They communicate with many bus
people so there is no telling how you ended up in their address book!?
Funny how we are all tied together through someone isn't it?  I'll talk to
them tommorrow.  Take care!
