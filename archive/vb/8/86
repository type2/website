Subject: push rods

   Well today I started to fix the minor problems I had on my new 1800
engine  (74X88). The only real problem I had is the valve train. I went to
adjust the valves after I got back from Colo, 2000 miles and found another
rocker shaft spring broken. I checked the other side and found 1 valve very,
very loose. I got out a set of Brand New rocker arm assemblies to install
and cut some new Chromoly push rods to fit and began to take everything
apart for the change over. 
   What I found blew my mind, all of my pushrods had started to mushroom, no
wonder my valves never tightened up on the whole trip. When my head guy did
the 3 angle valve grind on the new Manly valves in my heads he shimmed up
the springs to give me 120 lbs of spring pressure, the reason behind this
was because I have a tendency to run high revs (55 to 60 mph in 3rd) and to
make sure the valves seated good, he knows a lot more of the reasoning
behind this then I do. Many people say you would break the valves, but I
don't use those junk stainless valves from Israel that the rag mag guys
sell.
   I checked the plugs and even after rejetting in Colo I found them to be
burning good even at this altitude (400 above sea level) so I have decided
to leave the jetting alone on the Kadrons till I figure out how to open up
the air jet a little more.
   So anyway I have finished serving the engine, checked the lower head
bolts and tight as a drum, oil was fine, which I will change before I head
out to the Familianfest next weekend.
   I notice a 10 mph gain up the hills with the new 1800 so I can't wait to
do the next cruise to see how it works now that's it all dialed in and tuned
to groove again.

have a good weekend
Ronnie    going to take my 9 year old to the movies now.
