67 Deluxe 21-window "DARTHVW" Due to the all-black
paint job with red beltline and black deluxe trim. The
thing looks like Darth Vader drives it. I'll have to
find a new name once I restore it. Hmmm

69 hardtop Westy "TINY-E"  Stands for "Tiny Evel" I
have an Evel Knievel doll in the back window. But also
stands for Tiny-Elizabeth, my 10-month-old daughter.

Now, my wife, on the other hand, has another name for
my busses:

TWO LIFE SENTENCES

She says it's like two life sentences staring her in
the face from the garage. Just when it seems I will be
done with the first (bus) the other one is there,
mocking her.

Happy Friday
