Sorry for the possible non-bus content....

I got an email from Dionne & Kenny (dionej(-at-)fullnet.net), subject: Niel
Finch, email concerning some holiday get-together, and a file attachment
called CFGWIZ32.EXE.

First, did anyone else get this?  I don't know these people, and the
receipt area is "undisclosed"  I just don't know how I got it.

Second, do any of you know them?  If somehow they got
vintagebus(-at-)type2.com or wetwesties(-at-)yahoogroups.com on their address book,
it would come to me too.

Finally, What is that attachment?  Anyone know?


Thanks,

Adam
