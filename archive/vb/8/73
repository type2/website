Subject: Neil across the U.S.

Had a listee stop by today at work in a 71 Bug.  The bug had Georgia plates
on it.  The guy introduced himself to me as "Neil."  He emailed me back in
May about driving his bus to North Carolina to Kelly Brown's to get
restored.  He was driving back to Alaska in his beetle.  We visited for a
little bit but I wasn't going to able to extend any hospitality until noon.
He wanted to get on his way and that was that.  Had a nice visit about the
bug and the weather.  Wished I could have offered more but work had me tied
down.

Anyone remember Neil?  Was he the guy that stopped at J.P.'s back in late
May???
