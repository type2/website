Subject: ADMIN: Downtime on Saturday, 18 August

All,

The type2.com server had issues on Saturday.  www.type2.com was
unavailable and posts sent to the Type2 mailing list and the 
VintageBus mailing list were queued up but not distributed.

The server is back up and working on the mail backlog.  All of the
queued posts should come through, but it may take a little time.
The Web site, archives, etc, are available now.

Thanks!

Matt Roberds
