I know I have related this before. . . but here goes again. When I
bought my bus, I was told that it had been in "Forrest Gump". The scene
it was supposedly in was at the Washington Monument if the Mayday anti
war protest of 1971. And I thought I recalled the bus in that scene,
though I have not been able to find it on the video. Oh well. . . I
really don't give a rats behind cause thats not the reason I bought it.
Just the same. . . I felt the only appropriate name  was "Jenny". And
just for coincidence. . . I happened to have been present for that
protest. In fact, I think it was a pivotal day in the whole war thing.
Because, as we marched past the FBI building, several hundred thousand
strong that day, there was a high muckity muck up on the balcony
seemingly stunned to see so many people all flipping him the bird and
screaming the same four letter words. He he. It was beautiful, man. HA
ha. Anyways. . . that was then and this is now. Had to have that bus!
Will it ever get finished or is it just gonna slowly suck the life out
of me??

On a more serious note.. .  I have a friend that wants to sell me a few
parts, all for $400.00. They are two heads, numbers 311 101 353AV and
040 101 373 2.

One carb with base plate adapter . . . 113 1290295. .  a PICT 31.

And a set of forged Malle pistons and cylinders  . . . 311 198 069 F.

All of the above is brand new/ The heads are large valves for a type 3.

Does this sound good??
