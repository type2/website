Subject: WTB:  Internal regulator for alternator.

The alternator went bad in my bus back in April or May and so while I was
rebuilding my bus engine for 4th time, I swapped out to another good used
alternator.  Well I had this bad one sitting on the bench and decided that
I'll go ahead and pull the fan hub and key off of it and remove a couple
other fittings before I take it down as a core for a new one.  Well Autozone
want $100 for one. <Insert GULP here.>

I started tinkering around with it and I found that the internal voltage
regulator pack came off rather easily.  I pulled it off and found out the
reason why the alternator is bad is because one of the brushes is worn
completely down so that it can't make contact with the stator ring inside
the alternator.

RMMW wants $165 for a new alternator and $63 for the internal regulator.
What I'm wondering is if anyone has a junk alternator (one that might have
been disassembled, damaged, or seized up that they would like to liberate
the regulator off of and sell to me.  What I'd really settle for is a
replacement set of brushes that go into the regulator.  Thanks a lot
everyone...
