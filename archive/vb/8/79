Hi Ric,
Best to not just have your drums turned.  Often if you do not slam your 
brakes constantly the drums will return to thier round shape in about three 
weeks of driving.  Unlike USA automotive drums VW drums have very little 
material to turn out of them.  Since you can not get new German drums anymore 
and the recent repros we have heard about lately suck!  Check your VW Shop 
Manual for the limits that require turning before doing so!    Eric&Barb
