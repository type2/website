Subject: RE: [VB] Score! jealous

OK, here's one of mine. I bought 6 buses from a wrecking yard a few years
back for a 1000 dollars. With the help of VW Howard and Cory I got 3 of them
home and a lot of parts off the others. After selling what I could I ended
up getting paid 1000 to own my 1960 DD, which was all I was after anyway. So
a few people got a couple buses and a lot of parts for a really good deal (I
only wanted to get my money back) and I ended up with the DD I currently
drive and some extra money to put it together.

ps. I did buy a 64 Kombi, running driving with hippy interior here in Havasu
a long time ago for $150.00 and I still have it.

since we're going down and down on price, i'll chime in before jp tells us
of his $2 truck.
i unknowingly bought a 67 westy, complete, for $35. i was just standing
next to it when the auctioneer came past and said "ok, what's your number"
and it was mine. this was at the IRS auction for a resto place in waco,tx
called farm fresh a few years ago. after another person and i were in a
frenzy on trying to figure how to get 3 busses from texas to albuquerque,
we arranged it so shipping was practically nothing. i rebuilt the motor and
drove it for many years after.
