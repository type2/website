Talking of barndoors- does anyone know who will rebuild lever shocks  
including replacing the seal where the arm come out?  Mine work but they drip 
from there.  I had taken mine off, taken the lids off, rinsed them out and 
poured in new jack oil, and reinstalled them, but that drip drip drip.    I 
have a little pile of kitty litter under the bus there at each side in the 
garage to catch the drips.   I heard one guy who does it but he wants about 
$250 to do a pair, which seems kinda high to me.  The VW Workshop manual says 
to buy new ones from VW hah hah hah.
