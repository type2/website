Part of finding the deal is knowing enough to ask. OK,
Greg. I will give you $400. <bus and tent> and pick it

How does this benefit me?? He *gave* me his running

on the drivers side. But that's about it. I'm going
down to pick it up Sunday. I'm giving him $300 and
he's throwing in the tent as well...
