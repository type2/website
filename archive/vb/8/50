 To Da'List   Hi bus people I was wondering if anyone
 would care to share the story of how their bus got the
 name it now has. >>

[....]


This bus I now own, is named.....  "REFUGE"....  Prior to Making acquaintance 
of one another, I had no intention of owning a bay window. While working on a 
construction project in Seattle, I could see into the storage yard of a local 
towing company. at any time there was several buses there. (Go figure) I 
talked to a driver & found where they go from there, abandoned auto auction 
was his reply.

Got the address & showed up with my 100.00 bucks. The engine was broke, But 
like I said I had no intention of owning it. It was for Resale. Your not 
allowed to open the doors of the cars so I didn't know what to expect 
interior wise, but the out side was rust free, & not beat up. Oh yea it went 
for 100.00. Towed it home & cleaned it out
the PO had some... NASTY... living habits. I attempted to sell it at 
Octo-bug-fest. While there I found a 1776 for a good price, Put it in the 
Refuge & now I use it for camping, hauling, & just fun cruzin time.
