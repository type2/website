Subject: names and other problem....

The 63 was named IO. No not like I Owe, but Io being a moon that is the most 
active Volcanic sphere in our solar system.


Anyway, I have praised the dual carb set up on my bus, and now I am very 
annoyed at it.

Its been a bitch getting that left carb of mine to work right.
After using another carb as a rebiuld kit it worked great for a while, then 
it started acting up again.

Its a Kadron, and here is what is does:

It hesitates and causes poor running unless its wide open. After shut off it 
leaks fuel.
I am guessing I have a bad float or a bad regulator.

Your guesses?

Jason
