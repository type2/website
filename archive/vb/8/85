Subject: Vaccuum Cleaners and Alternators.

The alternator that went bad on my bus back in April or May just about went
in the trash or my salvage/core pile.  Being the cheapy that I am, I decided
to take the regulator off of it (internally regulated) just to see what was
in there.  Turns out a brush (those black carbon things that are spring
loaded and ride on armature) had worn clear down and was no longer making
contact.

I found a new set of electrolux vaccuum cleaner brushed that my dad had
bought way back in the 60s or 70s.  The carbon part was way too big but a
little grinding and eyeballing got it trimmed down to size.  I unsoldered
the old brush out of the regulator pack, soldered in the new one (being
careful not to lose the springs) and put it back together.

The guy at Autozone told me on the phone, "Yeah we can check it."  Got there
and the clamp wouldn't hold the alternator worth a crap.  I told him no
problem and thanked him.  Rode the scooter to the next auto place just down
a block and they had the older universal clamp on their machine.  The guy
hooked up the alternator, pressed some buttons, and the needle shot up to
14v.  He said, "Woo Hoo!  That one is really putting out.  Looks good to
me."

I told him the story that I've just told you and he laughed his arse off.
"Whatever works," he said as I walked out.

Amazing what you can fix with a little ingenuity.
