Subject: RE: [VB] Lowering spindle install

I just uninstalled a set. They are exactly like stock ones, with the spindel
raised up in order to drop the rim and tire. If you steering geometery is
out of wack, they will smakc you tires around everytwhere. Yse BAY window
rod ends, up through, and split inners down. I didn't tear mine up to see
how many shims were in em. I am assuming links aren't going to be in there
already.
195/75/14's can hit the innner well, I saw some top hit scrapes in there,
very small, not sure if the DPO was aBUSing her to accomplish that.

66 DLX getting higher up soon.

While I am sure that the Wolfgang Spindles I bought come with a wonderful
set of highly-detailed, picture-filled instructions, I am curious to hear
what kind of luck other listers have had with the installation of these fine
lowering products.

Thanks,
