Subject: Totalled Bus

Is Tony Marcellino on this list? I'm looking at the totalled 23-window he
has on Everett's site and I can't figure out from looking at the pictures
what happened to the bus.
It's a beautiful bus with some significant damage, I'm just wondering if
anyone knows what happened?
Sorry Tony if you're on the list, that's a real shame.
John Flowers :(
