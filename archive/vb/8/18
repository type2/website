Subject: Send me ALL your RMMW/Bandimere photos

In the first half of 2001, I've shot over 1000 photos with my Mavica and am
totally pictured out.  I didn't take one picture at RMMW or Bandimere and
the only picture I did try to get resulted in Bandimere security hollering
at me to get down off of the mountainside.

I would like to have my mailbox flooded with your pictures - even if it
includes people I don't know.  I'm hoping I can have a collection of photos
just to remember the event by.

I'm thinking that with the Buskatiers group, we should rotate picture duty
amongst the members so I don't get stiffed with it all of the time.  It's
fun at first but being the guy stuck behind the camera the whole time really
really sucks.
