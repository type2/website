To Da'List   Hi bus people I was wondering if anyone
would care to share the story of how their bus got the
name it now has.I am a newbie here and thought it
might help to learn who is out there.Those without a
bus at the moment might send in the name they want for
their bus and why......My 67 is named.. Ol'No
Name...after a black lab that was my buddy many years
ago during our prime beach days......Ah...back when
the beach bunnies just could not get enough of
me....."Hey Mark!!! Wake up and get back to work!!!.....

=====
Mark and his under-repair...by me...poor thing..67 Deluxe walk thru 13 window Ol'No Name in San Luis Obispo,Calif...7 miles to the ocean! Sea-Ya (:}
