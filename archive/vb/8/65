Subject: Re: [VB] Re name game--

1957 VW Oval Ragtop = 'Germy' because we bought it from German town TN, and
it's a German car, and some how it got shortened to Germy.

1967 VW Pop Top Westy = 'Droopy' because it's been hit in the front, and it
looks like it's sad.

1965 VW Pop Top Westy = Junker #1

1964 VW Double Door, Walk-Thru Panel = 'Cooter' because I told my wife,
"Guess What I Got?", and she said Cooties, well, it kinda stuck.

1965 VW 21 Window Deluxe Walk-Thru =  No name yet.

1973 VW Thing (Why would you name a thing?!?, it's too much fun saying goofy
things like, do you want to sit on my thing, would you like to see my thing,
now that you've seen my thing what do you think? and probably a thousand
more bad puns.
