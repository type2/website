Hi Ray,
Bad Ray, bad, bad Ray!  As others have pointed out you end up with sharper 
turning one direction while the other direction ends up with less sharp of 
turns when the steering is cranked all the way.  Additionally if you adjust 
the pitman arm on the steering box enough so it becomes even near parallel 
with the drag link at any time through the movement of the steering your 
steering can get stiff in the turns.  When parallel the steering will 
probably completely lock up!
  So take your pitman arm back off and reset it to where is was!  Then adjust 
your drag link properly!
