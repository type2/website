Hi Nate,
Your interior looks really great!

I'm wondering, did you use your old interior to pattern off of?  I couldn't
tell, but did you re-do the headliner to match?

I've got a 67 Sundial, with no real interior to speak of at all.  I'm hoping
I can piece together an interior, but since the wood probably won't match,
I'll probably end up having to re-create the interior, like you did.

Any chance of you p-mailing me, with details of how you did it/what you did?

Thanks,
Ed
