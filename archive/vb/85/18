Subject: Re: [VB] How Much Paint?

Like Bob Dole said when asked "boxers or briefs" - "Depends"

Is the new color darker or lighter than the old one?  How light/dark
of a color are you going to use?

Different types of paint have different components to be mixed, and
thus you end up different quantities of ready-to-spray paint.

I used 8-10 coats of yellow on my panel, but 4 of dove blue on my westy.
