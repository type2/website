`67 & `69 Bus Nice axle beams-complete
Selling a `67 Bus beam and a `69 to `70 beam. Both are solid and 
complete, drum to drum. They're heavy and shipping would be expensive, 
so it's best if they could be picked up. Delivery may be available. Lots 
of other Bus and Bug parts available! Please ask! Asking $75.00 each for 
the beams. Will deliver to the Beaver Springs, PA show Oct. 21st 
(serious buyers only, please!)
