Subject: Filling Body Holes

Hey everyone,

I have yet another question about restoring my '62 EZ Camper. A prior owner 
of my bus had air scoops over the louver holes on the back sides. Not all 
that remains are the drill holes. Please let me know what I should use to 
patch these holes up so that I can move on to painting my baby.

Thanks,
Joshua
