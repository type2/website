The color of your bus now, or the color you are going to matter very little, 
choosing the correct sealers is the key to good coverage.  Most base coats or 
even single stages will cover in 2 coats, provided you use the correct color 
sealer when you start painting.  And yes, you should always seal.  PPG makes 
sealers that can be matched exactly to your base coat, which means quick 
coverage!!  How much you put on with each coat will also decide how much 
paint you need.. Lots of variables when deciding how much paint to buy. You 
need to talk to your local paint store.. When buying paint, it's ALWAYS 
better to have left over, than to run out while painting, then you have touch 
up color etc..
