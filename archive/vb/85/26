Subject: RE: [VB] Filling Body Holes

Whats LabMetal??  How big of a hole will it work on??  The PO stuck the
radio antenna on the passenger door and I would like to move it.  Being
"welding challenged" I was wondering it this could work for this.  I would
rather leave the antenna there than stuff it full of bondo.

MIG weld them or use a product like LabMetal.  Don't use bondo.

Or, just install a new scoop!
