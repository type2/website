Hi Mike,
That all depends on where you live, the terrain driven, your expectations how 
fast of MPH hill climbing, and even how fast the local traffic is!  Some 
volks are happy with a 36 or  40 HP engines and sticking to 50 or a little 
less MPH for cruising only on the back roads to keep from being rear ended on 
freeways that are listed as 70 MPH where the majority drive 90 MPH.  Some are 
not happy with anything but a 2 liter or even a V-8 stuck in the back! 
  First you need to decide what top cruising speed you want and if you want 
good MPG, engine longevity or to floor it and ignore it.  Then it would help 
to know what gearing you have now.  At least taching your bus for 1,500 and 
3,000 RPM in all forward gears will give you some idea.
  Building an engine that is balanced, blueprinted and counter wieghted 
cranked is a good investment in both better longevity and some free HP to 
boot.
   Right now we are happy with our 1641CW cranked balanced SP and 3.875 
freeway flier with .82 fourth gear doing 3,000 RPM (-at-) 58 MPH with 205/75R15s 
(27" diameter) on all four in our 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion van. 
 If we had a late 62 or later bus we could put in bigger diameter tires to 
get the cruising speed up in the low 60s MPH that are wider at the same time, 
but we have the earlier narrower, lower ones that prevent this.  As we have 
trannies for our buses rebuilt we will probably go with a 3.44 R&P and gear 
it to do 62-65 MPH.  
  If you want we would be happy to Pmail you or anybody else the info we have 
accumulated in our quest for higher MPH cruising speed without losing 
longevity and MPG.
