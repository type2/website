Subject: repair reservoir

has anyone ever fixed a cracked brake fluid reservoir. Is it made of cast
nylon? is it possible to weld/melt a repair? I have a spare Im thinking of
experimenting on. Im thinking I could plug a cheap soldering iron into a
variac and vary the temp until I got a melt without burning.
Any / all thoughts appreciated.
