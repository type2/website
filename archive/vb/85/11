Subject: RE: [VB] Filling Body Holes

There was a great article in one of the recent Hot VW or VW trends mags on
just that subject. Don't pin me down on an exact month, but it was between
August of last year to now. You can find it by going to their website and
looking in the articles.

Hey everyone,

I have yet another question about restoring my '62 EZ Camper. A prior owner 
of my bus had air scoops over the louver holes on the back sides. Not all 
that remains are the drill holes. Please let me know what I should use to 
patch these holes up so that I can move on to painting my baby.

Thanks,
Joshua
