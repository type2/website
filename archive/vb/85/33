Easy if you have a Briggs tap. I find a listing for 1/8" NPT tap drill
size with an R drill at .3390.

I am interested in tap and plug sizes for the type 1 engine oil galleys.
The plug location for the galley port off the oil pump is very short
and stepped just behind the original pressed plug.
Does anyone have a specific recommendation for the galley plugs ?
Choice of sizes, threads, and materials ( steel,brass,aluminum, etc. )?
