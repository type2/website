The "one man brake bleeder" isn't even as fancy as a check valve, just
a couple of feet of tubing and bottle.

This last week someone on the list was talking about the
windshield wiper reservoir not keeping water in the line long enough
for
the water to get to the windshield without pumping very quickly. So it
was suggested to use an aquarium one way valve to stop the water from
coming back. I thought this would be useful in bleeding your brakes as
well if you were the only one around and can't tighten the brake
nipple
and push the pedal at the same time. Has anyone thought of this? I
know
there is a kit out there that is a self bleeding kit that you can buy?
But this would be very cheap and work the same way.

...something to ponder!



And just a thought
