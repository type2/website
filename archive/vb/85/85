To remote filter a late 1500 (1600) DR case i would guess requires 1/2"i.d. hoses,
and the local availability of hydraulic lines would mean pipe threads and not AN
fittings. Would it make any difference to go larger hoses? Can you make a
tapered pipe thread angle fitting stop where the hose needs to turn and not be
too loose or overtorqued? Or is there a more appropriate fitting for the case return line?
( I want to keep the type 4 cooler clean :)
