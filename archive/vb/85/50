Subject: Interior Light

I have a 1967 Crew Cab that I am trying to get together after years of
neglect. The headliner is a cardboard type material, does anyone know where
I can get this? Also I have an interior light but the wiring is gone. What
route did the wires take to get from the light to the dash? Thanks in
advance...

Ronnie
