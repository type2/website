Subject: New Camper Interior Pics!!

Hey Everyone,

I just basically finished the most involved resto of my life. . . The
interior of my '66 E-Z Camper. (WHEW!!)  I've still got to fabricate a sill
plate for the entry way onto the floor and do some minor trimming on the
seam.  I'm going to tackle the two tattered front seats next week.  Here's
some links to the pics so far:

Resto-Nazis BEWARE; I didn't restore it back to original since it just
didn't fit my families needs.  I restored it as a people mover that's
capable of going camping.  All the credit for the way it turned out goes to
my father who is a wood master.  I, on the other hand, am a wood IDIOT!! ;-)

The paneling is Baltic Birch purchased in 5'x5' sheets.  The floor is a
real, hardwood oak par quay with oak trim.  My father is making the table
right now as well as a map case w/ flip-out counter which will be attached
to the side of the ex-ice box (now custom cabinet with original door to fool
all the Resto-Nazis) ;-)  I just had to show it to folks who can appreciate
stuff like this!!  Man I'm stoked!!!
