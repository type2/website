Subject: Bus sighting....

I was in Elgin TX this weekend and had a bus sighting. Unfortunatly I came 
home with food poisoning and forgot all about it til today. Anyway....

I'm more than positive it was list member Greg Silkenson trailering one of 
his single cab trucks somewhere. So Greg...are you gettin' it painted or 
selling it or what?
