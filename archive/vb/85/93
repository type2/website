Subject: Fuse Box

Is there supposed to be a clip of some kind that holds the fuse box up
against the plate it mounts in?  

And any suggestions on how to remove paint off wires?  Will paint remover
eat at the insulation?  When my cab was painted they painted over all the
wires and now that I need to change out the fuse box I can't tell which wire
is which.
