Subject: bus- is it worth it?/camper parts

well, i think ive found myself a new addition to my vw family....its a 66 camper bus, still a hippie bus, so the guy only wants like 1200 for it. it has a newly rebuilt engine, and almost ALL the camper bits. its a poptop (the small sqaure kind) and has a 1/4 roof rack. the camper bit it has:
small foldown table on door
large foldown table on  other door
spice rack
the cabinet that fixes to the cieling 
the cabinet in the rear on the dirvers side (small) 
all the louvered windows, none cracked
all the door panels (and roof)
has the electical plug on the outsidehm....oh, and curtains
the things wrong with it-
frozen speedo
drivers side rear coner panel with a fairly bad dent, but limited to that panel
little bit ot rus on pan under clutch foot (duh)
blown windsheld wiper motor (but all parts there)
it is primer gray, with the exeption of all the hippie stickers
is this buw worth 1200-1500? it is in runs and drives, dailey driver.
