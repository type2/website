Subject: RGB tran rebuild

   Well I'm just about done on a month long mission to assemble and rebuild
a trans with RGB's. After all is said and done it will be one nice trans but
the problems encountered along the way make me sit back and reflect on our
industry. I have come to the conclusion that parts that aren't being
reproduced are getting harder then heck to get. I have been on a mission to
get GOOD end gears, fulcrums and axles and have spent a lot of money on
parts from suppliers that I wouldn't use or sell. All this in the quest to
find GOOD usable parts. I am now on another mission to collect all the RGB
parts, axles, end gears and fulcrums I can find (for future use). I have a
machine shop here in Havasu that is going to set up and regrind the paddles
on the ends of bus axles for me and then do the same to the oversize
aftermarket fulcrums I have found (to fit the paddles), at least I will able
to salvage a majority of the junk (as of today) bus axles I have.
   The same is happening with wheel bearings. FAG bearings for RGB are now
made at there factory in KOREA, SKF are made in Mexico or the U S. (but I
did get lucky and buy out a supplier of all there German ones)  asked them
to open every box if I committed to take them all! So I got a few of the
lower outer German bearings, much nicer then any of the same brand non
German ones.
  So the point of my ranting is TAKE CARE of your stuff or you will have a
hard time keeping it on the road when the quest for QUALITY parts arises.

  ronnie, so happy I'm almost done with this project, only 3 more to do (but
I do have all the parts I need)

ps. even talking to the trans shop I have been informed of the scarcity of
3.88 r/p and 82 4th gears slowly leading to higher cost of our beloved
Freeway Flyer tansmissions
