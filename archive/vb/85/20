Subject: Re: [VB] How Much Paint?


Ok, now what paint system (products) do you wanna use?

I'm guessing at least 2 quarts of each color, which with the PPG
CLV that I use would give you 1.25-1.5 gallons sprayable.

If you're cost-concious, use the Omni LV, which is cheaper, but
doesn't mix in the same ratio, so you'd need more paint.  I used
a gallon of it on my '55 westy.
