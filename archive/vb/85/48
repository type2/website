Hey folks.

Due to Verio-Seattle closing down their last colocation facility, our ISP
is moving again. (yeah, I know, we already moved once this year...right
after that (when verio closed their first facility) we were told they'd be
closing the one we just moved into.)


Anyway, we're moving to a new colo in an AT&T datacenter.

I'm not entirely sure of when exactly we're moving...I was expecting two
weeks notice, but have instead been told it might well be tonight!!

If we ARE moved tonight, expect between two days and a week of problematic
access for at least some of you while things settle.

Hopefully, though, I'll be able to get it pushed back a few days so i can
prepare properly.


This affects all type2.com and vintagebus.com webservers, mailing lists,
and email accounts.

I'll keep you as up to date as I can on the progress.



...david
