Subject: Tranny Question

I've got a line on a used big stub transaxle with redux boxes and
everything.

Is there anyway to tell, from the casting numbers or some other method if
the gearbox is actually from a bus instead of a bug?

Reason I ask is that I want to get the used transaxle to have a bus forth
and ring and pinion. I have a rebuilt gearbox but, it has bug gears and ring
and pinion.
