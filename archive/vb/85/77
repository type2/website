the Club is one of the easiest things for a thief to get around, especially
on a VW; they just cut the steering wheel. I won't get one around here after
a friend of mine got his *mpala stolen that way... think I'm gonna check out
shifter lock for my bus. Anyone use or have any experiences with the Berg
shifter/lock combination?
