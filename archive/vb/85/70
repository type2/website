Subject: [VB] bus- is it worth it?/camper parts


well, i think ive found myself a new addition to my vw family....its a
66 camper bus, still a hippie bus, so the guy only wants like 1200 for
it. it has a newly rebuilt engine, and almost ALL the camper bits. its a
poptop (the small sqaure kind) and has a 1/4 roof rack. the camper bit
it has: small foldown table on door large foldown table on  other door
spice rack the cabinet that fixes to the cieling 
the cabinet in the rear on the dirvers side (small) 
all the louvered windows, none cracked
all the door panels (and roof)
has the electical plug on the outsidehm....oh, and curtains
the things wrong with it-
frozen speedo
drivers side rear coner panel with a fairly bad dent, but limited to
that panel little bit ot rus on pan under clutch foot (duh) blown
windsheld wiper motor (but all parts there) it is primer gray, with the
exeption of all the hippie stickers is this buw worth 1200-1500? it is
in runs and drives, dailey driver.
