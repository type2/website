Curt and anyone else who gives a crap....
I jotted down some numeros on the cruise home.
Background info:
63 EZ-stock height
205-75-15's
1600 DP, 34PICT, 010 dizzy, stock exhaust, big nut 3:88 Rancho tranny

here's the tach numbers:
2800 (-at-) 55 mph
3200 (-at-) 60 mph
3500 (-at-) 65 mph
3900 (-at-) 70 mph

Like previously mentioned..62-63 mph seems to be sweet spot in my bus, so I 
usually cruise there.  I have run 65 mph in the desert for extended periods 
(Jerome/Havasu-fully loaded) and never had any heat probs (Berg dipstick).

Later,
Beto
