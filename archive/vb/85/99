If it has reduction boxes, it would *have* to be a bus trans,
unless it was in some sort of baja or something!

I've validated a bus center section by turning the input shaft
clockwise, and holding one part of the diff assembly with my
hand - the other side will turn *backwards* (reverse) if it's a
bus trans.
