With all these thefts and attempts I might have to drive my F#(-at-)D into Cali
this weekend for VW Drag Day and Pomona! and leave my bus at home, where I
know it's safe

Someone broke into the DC last night and punched the ignition.
They could not get it started, club was still on the steering wheel.
Ignition left on and lock cylinder on floor when I got in this morning.

Any leads on a new ignition switch for a '60 DC?

Thanks

Scott
