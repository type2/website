Funny, the JB weld that I used on my carb nearly a decade ago is still in
good shape.  I use it to seat the inlet tube and the "dime", so it is
definitely in contact with fuel.  IIRC, the package instructions say that
the stuff is suitable for use in contact with fuel and oil, which is why I
used it.  Most RTV adhesive/sealers break down in contact with fuel.

One "must do" when dealing with JB weld is to clean the surfaces squeaky
clean before assembling.  Spray carb cleaner works well for this.
