Subject: Re: [VB] Filling Body Holes

Hi Joshua,
I just did the same thing to my 67 Sundial.  I used JB Weld to fill up the
holes.  Actually, I had some even larger holes in my body, like where the PO
drilled a big hole for an electrical outlet.  I JB Welded a round piece of
metal on the underside of the hole, and when it dried, filled up the large
hole with JB Weld, let it dry, and smoothed it out.

Had a friend who welded up the holes that his air scoops made . . .came out
ok, but some of the metal got too hot from the torch, and "warped" some of
his louvres.  Obviously, be real careful if you/or somebody who tells you
they know what they're doing, weld up the holes....Whatever you do-don't
Bondo them.

Good luck,
Ed
