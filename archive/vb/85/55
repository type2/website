Ok, something is wrong.  They *can't* be random, isolated, coincidental incidents.
There's a bigger picture we're not seeing.  This smells like a concerted
effort with several people involved in the theft and disposal of these
cars.  With the number and type of cars targeted, we can almost guarantee
they're after the cars for resale.  You don't joyride double cabs!

Several years ago, we had a similar rash of thefts in the Sacramento area,
and rumor was a bunch of cars were found in makeshift chop shop in the
Elk Grove/Wilton area.  This could be something similar.
