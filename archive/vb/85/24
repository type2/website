Subject: RE: [VB] Drag link adjustment

I started this thread and (I am almost embarased to say) I took the easy way
out; I wrote a check.

Actually I wanted to have somebody check over my work to make sure I wasnt
on the fringes of gleefully hurting myself with "thinking" I know what I am
doing.  I never had a or worked on VW before the better part of three years
ago; its been me the idiot book and the list with nobody really looking over
my shoulder.

I found a GREAT mom and pop place here in town, to do the front-end
alignment.  Billy runs the shop with a couple of mechanics, and dad (gotta
be in his mid 70s) was hanging around the shop; when I got there he was
working on a Model A F*rd for a friend.  Dad latched on to me when I walked
in the door; he had me all over the bus checking everything I had done for
the last 2+ years, and showing me things to watch out for.  For example, he
showed me that I was not getting the bearing nut on tight enough (and I had
a bearing starting to go bad).  I'll replace the bearing this weekend.
There is no book or email thread that begins to substitute substitute
actually feeling how much play there should be when the wheel is jacked up.
The only thing wrong with the alignment was the toe-in and they adjusted the
drag link after the toe-in was set.  Dad also handed me the grease gun and
had me lubing the chasis.

I felt bad that the tab for the repair shop was only $40.  I feel that I got
more than my $$ worth in advice.

Ya know, I was better off with engine rebuilds. This body stuff is getting
me into more hot water than I figured. Thanks you guys for continually
bailing me out!

Hi Ray,
Only if you promise to make sure to mention the very possible dangerous
ramifications when suggesting that quick fix again!   ;-)
