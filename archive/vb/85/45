Subject: AUCTION STILL ON: PUT A/C IN YOUR '71 OR EARLIER BUS

ALL,

Just as a reminder, the new, unused, complete A/C system for '71 and earlier 
buses that I have for sale on eBay is still available.  The current bid is 
$480.00, with just a little more than a day remaining.  I bought the unit 
for $1,200 new, including shipping, and am selling it so I can make more 
more room in my budget to restore my '66 Micro DeLuxe.  You can see the unit 
at:

I am desperate to get this item sold so that I can get my baby on the road 
again. Thanks for your time.

R
