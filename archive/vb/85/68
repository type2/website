Funny you should say... the police in San Jose (I think it was anyway) have 
just such a thing except it isn't a bus... don't recall what it is exactly.  
Anyway when the would be's steal the vehicle it runs a short distance, stops 
and locks all the doors with the perp's inside, has a remote control thing 
for the "man" to use... sweet.  Nice touch eh?  All gift wrapped and what 
not.
