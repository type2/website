Subject: RE: [VB] RE: Knob next to the heater knob!

Hello Again

	The Knob turned out to go no where and was PO installed. So I just yanked
it out and called it good. The good new is that I got the bus running on its
own and all the lights are working after 13 years in dormancy. I can't
believe the condition that the wiring is in for this old of a bus. The only
thing bad on this one is floor board rust and I will have to replace the pan
halves. Other than that it has a good start to be road worthy again just
need to make sure to be careful where I park it.

Thanks for everyones help!

Hello Again

	Well it is not a heater knob so far as I can tell and there isn't any
writing on the knob. I will be replacing the fuel line tomorrow and I will
see if it has a fuel switch below for the reserve.

Either that or the fuel reserve knob??

Hello Everyone

	I just got my 1965 21 window Deluxe Started after it had been in storage
over 13 years from the PO. I put a New battery in it and it came to life
(Yippee!). I have a question about the Knob that is next to the heater knob
what is it? I pull the knob out with no cable attached and I am wondering if
it is some kind of choke.
