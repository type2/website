Subject: Re: [VB] Stolen VW's

Hey thanks for the Hint! I got back early this morning from a short vacation
the neighbor across the street came out and said she was watching the house
for cars and people BECAUSE on Sunday she was at a auto parts store in line
and one person was asking where to get VW van parts and they described my
house with the VW vans allover and how to get there and to just go overthere
some night and take what you need ! SO I pulled out the inside door handles
locked all the doors and backed the 1963 Van up to the garage door (tight)
so they can't open the deck lid. I feel like sleeping in the Van with the
pistol grip shotgun, but I can hear myself describing  what happened to the
officer: " you did What when they started taking off a head light ?"
Lloyd
