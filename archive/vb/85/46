Subject: Help!! Most Bizzare Electrical Gremlin Ever???

I hate these electrical problems.  This is a wierd one though:

Behavior:  Bus will not always start- not even a college-try from the 
starter.  If its going to start its got tons of juice, if its not, the 
lights come on, but there's no starter activity.  Last night I drove 
home, stopped the engine, then immediately tried starting it, and 
NOTHING.  Headlights were bright.  12.6 volts on battery.  belt tight. 
 Then i disconnected the battery ground and went to sleep.  This morning 
it started right away with lots of power.  I even delayed pressing on 
the gas so that I could engage the starter longer until the battery 
pooped out, but it didn't.  I've also observed that if it doesn't start, 
I can walk away and come back in 10 minutes and sometimes it starts like 
nothings wrong.

Background:
'65 w/12 volt, '71 engine, New Battery, new starter, generator (2 yrs 
old bosch- not a rebuild), regulator (2yrs old bosch), new belt

Tests:
12.6 on battery with engine off
13.5-14v with engine running
I removed negative battery cable and checked resistance from cable to 
negative battery terminal:  it appeared to be a short until i removed 
the generator harness, then when i put the generator harness back again, 
there was no more short.  Why would remove/replace the harness change 
the result?

I think I'm in an altered universe where the laws of physics don't 
apply.  Could this be related to a botched polarization of the generator?
