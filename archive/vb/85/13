         Start off by grinding off the paint, leave yourself lots of room.  
Then clean out the inside of the hole with a drill bit the same size as the 
hole.  After that bevel the hole with a larger drill bit.   Weld it up, if 
you keep your heat down their are no need for fences or heat sinks.   The 
main thing is to no weld so many holes that the heat gets stored up in the 
metal.  I myself weld one hole on one side and then hop over to the other 
side, going back and forth between the 2 sides.  After all the holes are no 
longer holes you'll want to sand blast them.  This is where the little pocket 
blaster I've mentioned before really shines.  Got the welds blasted?  Its on 
to the grinding!!  Keep your heat down by making your grinding passes short 
and sweet.    After some practice you won't need any body fillers, so you 
might wanna play with some scrap metal first.  Feather, prime, and paint!!
                                                                              
                                  Peace,
