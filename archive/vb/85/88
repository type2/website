I use a mightyvac hand pump, just put it on, make sure MC is nice and
full, pump it, crack the valve, pump some more, all done. Works great.

This last week someone on the list was talking about the windshield
wiper reservoir not keeping water in the line long enough for the water
to get to the windshield without pumping very quickly. So it was
suggested to use an aquarium one way valve to stop the water from coming
back. I thought this would be useful in bleeding your brakes as well if
you were the only one around and can't tighten the brake nipple and push
the pedal at the same time. Has anyone thought of this? I know there is
a kit out there that is a self bleeding kit that you can buy? But this
would be very cheap and work the same way.

...something to ponder!



And just a thought
