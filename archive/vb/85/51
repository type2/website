Subject: RE: [VB] Interior Light

BFY carries the headliners as well as people like WolfsburgWest... are your
interior panels thrashed or are you just looking for nice new ones?  (BTW, I
have a brand new set from BFY that I would trade along with a few $$$ for a
set of reasonably nice og panels for my 59 double cab)

Also, the interior light runs through the cab roof to the drivers side top
channel, above the drivers side door and then through the A pillar to the
windshield wiper switch.  It should be a red wire inside a piece of black
pvc tubing.

Ronnie asked:

I have a 1967 Crew Cab that I am trying to get together after years of
neglect. The headliner is a cardboard type material, does anyone know where
I can get this? Also I have an interior light but the wiring is gone. What
route did the wires take to get from the light to the dash? Thanks in
advance...
