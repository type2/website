  Caution on dealer hubcap clips. Being the word was out that the dealer had
clips I ordered 100 from them and was shocked to find out that they were VW
Mexico and not German. I compared them to the German ones I get direct and
there is a difference. Hopefully VW will take them back as I can buy Mexican
ones at about 1/3 the cost of German. They were in a VW/Audi labled bag but
with Hecho in Mexico on it.

ps; the rivets were German though

Thanks everyone,

So the clips, "springs", are at the VW dealer but without the mysterious
tool any suggestions on how to get those rivets on?
