Subject: How Much Paint?


Talk about 100 questions! I appreciate all of the great advice that I have 
been given already, but I have yet another question. I am looking at 
painting my '62 EZ. I plan on doing the top half and interior 1 color and 
the bottom half, wheels and bumpers a 2nd color. My question is how much of 
each paint will I need to get the job done? I don't want to buy two gallons 
and have massive left over. Cost is an issue for me.

Thanks again,

Joshua
