Hi Volks,
Do not use a helicoil here.  Only use them in areas where you will never ever 
remove the bolt again or in emergency fix it road situations till you can 
install a solid insert.  Eric has way too much bad experience with helicoils 
in the USAF!  Go with a solid insert from TimeSert.  Either way one has to 
have a special sized tap to install these thread repair devices properly so 
as to have maximum holding power and not end up the wrong thread size to 
boot.
