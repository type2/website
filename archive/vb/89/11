Hi John,
I believe that you must consider the exhaust also.  You either need to
install a stock transporter muffler, an extractor, or either cut holes in
your bumper, or at least dimple the bottom of your bumper so that the exhast
tips will clear the rear bumper.

is some type of bracket or hanger that connects to the oil pump cover
plate??  Or is that just for putting a T1 engine in a T4 bus?? can anyone
share experiences of their own?
