Does not believing the evil doers are either w/ us or against us, drinking
mass quantities of "St Provo Girl" or "Polygamy Porter", not being able to
join the PCA cuz you don't own a Porsche yet, still haven't got the Westy on
the road, and facing the dilemma of 2 kids away in college next year, and
what all that means in regards to my split bus budgets' even cum close to a
Friday topic?  I dunno, but it beats the alternative of having no buses!!
