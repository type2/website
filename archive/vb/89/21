Hi susan,
Go here on my site, and it should tell you what you need to know.

if you really want specific measurements and weren't just wondering how to
tell the year differences, let me know and I can give you those.

Dear Listees,
1.    What are the dimensions of the side gates and tail-gate for a
singlecab?
2.    Are the gates for a '68 the same as
       '67 and earlier?
Thanks for the info....
Susan
