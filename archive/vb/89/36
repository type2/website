You will need to rig up some kind of a press to get those frames back
into position where you can put the screws back in.  A couple of 2x4 or
1x4 sections of lumber and a couple 2-3 foot bar clamps usually work. 
Push everything back together as much as you can, then apply the wood
and clamps to each side.  Gradually tighten them (do not force) until
the screw holes line up, and there you are.
