Subject: Re: [VB] Rear Hatch Pin

The one I need is about 3/4" to 7/8" long from head to tip.  I think 
that's the short one.  Its not the one at the roof line, but the lower 
one.  Do you have one or know where I can get one?  I checked the 
archives but couldn't find a description how to do it.  I'm thinking 
alot of vise grips, a few guys and some steel bars, and a crash helmet.
