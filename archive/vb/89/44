Subject: RE: [VB] What is this?

This one came out of a pre '67 beetle.  I haven't been into beetles for a
long time so I couldn't tell what year it was exactly since I couldn't find
the vin tag, the tail light lenses and rear deck lid were gone.  Do you
happen to have a wiring diagram for it?

Woah, yes, I think it is.  I have something that looks like that in my '67
Squareback, I wasn't sure it was "real," I thought someone (possibly a VW
dealer) had put it together.

It probably works correctly for a '67 Bus but does not function exactly
"correct" for a Type 3 because a Type 3 has a warning light for when you
have the parking lights on and not your headlights, it does not turn that
light on/off as designed.
