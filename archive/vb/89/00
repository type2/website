It was a really clean bus, especially  for the east coast, but it took some
undoing to get it that way.  I had already stoped all the surface rust etc
that was there. My main gripe to the po would have been the blue and white
cheap ass paint job that flaked when you washed it over the og velvet green.
The excessive stickers came off with a blade and they didnt throw away the
westy interior(except the ice box) when they took it out to install an
"improved" home brew set up. Had some minor wiring hacks, the motor was a
mess,  But got a new one along with a new tranny,  rebuilt front end and
brakes. It was really like a new car, almost never broke.  Closest I've come
to a restored bus.
