As a matter of fact, that has almost happenned to me.  I tried a sampler in
Vail Colorado of Vail pale ale, killer bee honey ale, beaver trial brown
ale, and rainbow trout stout,, then switched to fat tire for my fifth, all
the while wondering how I was going to fare during the apocolypse.  Well, my
mind went wandering, and I was thankful that even though my wife was a
banker, I was not a clerk, then I thought back to the times when I wasn't
married, didn't have any busses, but I missed out on the L7 set at
lallapalooza in Rhode Island because I was too busy getting a tour of the
Sportsmobile's(bus content enclosed) z bed that we were parked next to in
our 87 Ch*vy N*va.  Luckily, that little adventure led me into the this
life, where I now have to budget $20 a month of secret money to buy  front
wheel cylinders for the 65 so I can stop all the nonsense.
