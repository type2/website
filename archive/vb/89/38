Woah, yes, I think it is.  I have something that looks like that in my '67
Squareback, I wasn't sure it was "real," I thought someone (possibly a VW
dealer) had put it together.

It probably works correctly for a '67 Bus but does not function exactly
"correct" for a Type 3 because a Type 3 has a warning light for when you
have the parking lights on and not your headlights, it does not turn that
light on/off as designed.

Bus content:
The '67 Type 3 flasher relays are the same as a Bus, with a 211 part #.
