Sounds good to me. Butt welds are a lot harder to master though. I'd hate to
send an apprentice welder off to learn how to butt weld before he knew how
to do lap welds.

Also, if you make the flange so that the seam is "inside" the bus, dirt and
such wouldn't be a problem. When I do a lap weld, I weld the seam inside the
bus as well as the outer seam.
