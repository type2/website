Subject: Rear hatch hinges

Just to update my earlier post, squareback rear hatch
hinge stuff IS the same as later split busses, but the
clips on the pins are WAY easier to remove (at least
on the later SB's).  I did learn that you have to
remove almost all the SO-42 interior to get to the
hinges which made it more than an hour job.  Also, the
springs are not the same, but the linkages are.

My daughter's westy now has an orange hinge.
