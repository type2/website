Subject: Re: [VB] cooling options

With a 1641 the stock tin is way more than adequate as it is.

If you need some cooling ideas the easy ones are:
1. T4 or T3 cooler.  See the archives/library

2. T3 Super cool tin.  See the archives/library

3. Clean flat black valve covers, pushrod tubes, black cylinders, and any
metal that touches oil.  These parts must be rust free and flat black to
cool most efficiently.  I paint my magnesium blocks flat black as well, but
most people do not.

4. A reasonable CR.  I like mine between 7.5-8:1.

5. Stock air thermostat and flaps.

6. A clean motor.... Good for 10 degrees at least!

Here are a few I do not recommend for a 1641, but others use:

1.  Deep sump oil pan.

2.  External cooler.  Without a thermoswitch!!! :(  If you must do this be
certain to put a thermoswitch in.  

3.  Porsche fan conversion.  Overkill city.  Only can use an external
cooler.  Expensive.  Really do not need it unless you are pushing over 2.0L
in a T1 engine.


In summary a little 1641 is not anything to worry about when it comes to
cooling.  Just put it back together stock and let it roll.
