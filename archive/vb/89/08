Subject: Re: [VB] 8v battery instead of 6v???

OK, for the specific problem that is not related to brighter lights, etc.    
What actually got the marbles rolling in my head was I have this 36hp I was 
trying to start the other night.  Picked it up at the rama swap last year 
and it has sat who knows how long. I am just curious to see if it runs and 
how well.  The end play is not excessive so I was thinking of running it in 
one of my busses as is till I get around to rebuilding it.   The problem is, 
I have three 6v starters, one a new rebuilt bosch, brand new 6v battery full 
charge and the thing turns over slow.  Slow as in relation to 12v.  It hits 
here and there, but it just seems like 6v just turns it over too slow to 
start it. I tried all three starters with the same results and the battery 
is full charged. Now I tried squirting some WD-40 in the cyliders to see if 
that would speed things up and no it didnt.  I am jumping the solenoid at 
the starter, not going thru the key.  I am 6v dumb (amongst other things as 
I am sure you will let me know) as I have never ran it, not sure how fast 
they are supposed to turn the motor over.  Maybe if I checked the 6v RPM 
while trying to start it someone could tell me if it was correct and my 
problem lies in the other 20 - 30 potential problems it could be why it is 
not starting.  I will letcha know the RPM tonight :) Thanks.
