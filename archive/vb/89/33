Subject: Anyone in Austin TX/bus for sale

hello all,
 My parents have a 62 bus in lauga vista that we are gonna sell. It would
need some work, i think it is missing the motor as well as some other
things. I dont have any pics of it but if any one wants to check it out I
will find out an address.
thanks,
 Bryan
