OK, but I still don't know how dirt got "inside" the bus. Are there any
inner rockers or cargo floors on this bus? Was the PO off-roading with the
cargo doors open?

There is plenty of room to get to the inside lap. All you have to do is cut
the rocker high enough so that the inside lap is higher than the top edge of
the inner rocker. I also fiberglass the lap on the inside of the bus. BTW,
I'm working on crew cab, not a bus. I don't guess that makes a difference,
does it?

I did lap welds because I can use a higher setting on my welder and get
better penetration. When you butt weld thin metal, you have to cut the
voltage way down and it takes more time to stitch such a long run. The outer
lap also leaves a small gutter that I use to make my transition to the
existing panel using filler.
