Subject: Re: [VB] Corona de Tucson

Corona de Tucson will be held the weekend of March 23/24.  There is a caravan 
from Phoenix to Tucson on Saturday, the 23rd leaving from the Fry's 
Electronics parking lot at I-17 and Baseline road.  The caravan leaves 
promptly at 7:00 AM.  If anywone wishes to come down on Friday night, that's 
fine as long as it's understood that it is $10 per vihicle per night.

As far as I can tell, the info on Everett's site is correct.  If anyone has 
any questions regarding Corona de Tucson, don't hesitate to ask.
