Hi Rich,
You might be able to find a rebuild kit for it or if the bore of the cylinder 
is corroded to badly have a rebuild shop install a brass or stainless sleeve 
inside it and rebuild it for you (Check Hemmings Motor News for these brake 
cylinder shops.) or install a 72 and later bus dual circuit MC that can be 
had nationwide at any NAPA store for about $40.00.  This latter MC will keep 
your bus safe from loosing all braking power if you blow out a slave (wheel 
cylinder), flex or even a hard brake line!  Check the type2 library for our 
article on installing this later MC into pre-1968 VW bus.
