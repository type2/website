Subject: Re: [VB] redux/trans repair

Thanks for the good advice, once I got rid of those ridges the side
gears slipped right out.
I'll mess with the redux box end plugs later, I like the idea of
leaving a nut welded on to expedite future removal.
Can I weld up the oversize spring plate to redux box bolt holes myself
or does that require special techniques or equipment?
