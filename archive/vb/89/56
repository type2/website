Subject: M/C on '67

It looks like there is a slow leak on the master cylinder in my '67.  I just
did a quickie on-line price check.

<GULP> $175.

I realize it is a 'one year only' item and unless I dont want to stop I
really dont have much of a choice in the matter.  Has anybody else out there
seen them cheaper?? How about a rebuilt one??
