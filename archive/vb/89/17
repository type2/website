Subject: Re: [VB] 8v battery instead of 6v???

Damn good idea.  This was a 12 volt tranny with my to-be-installed split 
case tranny sittin on the garage floor still.  To get the thing to mate, I 
took the brass bushing out and left the aluminum piece in there thinking it 
would be good enough for testing it out knowing there was some wobble.  I 
will see if I can find a 6v bushing and see what she does.  Thanks and 
thanks to all the others for their hints.  Maybe 6v aint so bad after all 
....
