Subject: Re: [VB] 8v battery instead of 6v???

This is actually asking for trouble.
The problem develops in 6V systems when connections deteriorate to the point
where resistance develops and the voltage delivered to devices like lights drops
to the point where they are too dim to use.

Increasing the voltage will result in the lamps getting the five or six volts
that they need BUT....

the resistance that caused the original problem is still there and now it has an
opportunity to bite you big time.

The resistance in bad connections will heat up even more as a result of the
increased voltage and can cause the wires at those connections to heat up to the
point where they will either slowly melt the insulation or if its really bad,
heat it up quick enough to cause the insulation to start smoking.

One thing I've seen happen is for the insulation to slowly melt away and then
one day, it falls off leaving about 3" of bare wire on the back of the
terminal.  Next thing happens is that you're blowing fuses every time you hit a
bump and can't figure out why.

THE BEST SOLUTION FOR DIM LAMPS ON A SIX VOLT SYSTEM is to go through every
connection, clean the wire under the connection, refasten it and properly
tighten it.  If you work your way through the bus in a systematic manner, you
should be able to get the job done on a weekend and a six-pack and still have
time for a honey-do or two.
