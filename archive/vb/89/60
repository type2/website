Like you said...practice...practice...practice, before you start on the
bus.

Well, when I opened my rusty rockers that did not have any holes through to
the outside I took out large chunks of dirt in the shape of the
rocker...could have just been my bus that someone off road'ed. I still have
a chunk sitting on my garage wall.

Wow, that is a neat trick for an outside rocker?  How do you get to the
inside (top part of the lap) when you are welding an outside rocker?  Are
you using the extra tall rockers so that you could get to the top seam from
the inside?  I agree if you can weld the top part of the lap then there is
no chance of water or drit getting in there.  But, why do the extra
welding, when if you do small spot welds (ala http://www.metwiz.com) you
can easily do a but weld? Granted,more time involved in fitting, clamping,
triming though.  

Always more than one way to skin a cat though :-)
