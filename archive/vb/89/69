Hi, All...
   Just wanted to let everyone on the list know that my bus,
known as Possum, made it's return to the open road today
after being last parked in a farmers field in 1972. I was a
proud daddy.
   Much work still lays ahead, but the major mechanical
work is done.
   Thanks to the list for everyone's wisdom and inspiration.
Hitting that accelerator and feeling the bus get up and go
makes it all worth it!
   Thanks again, All...

(If you would like to see the pics of my rescue and recovery
of this bus, you can follow the link below...thanks!)
