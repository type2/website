Subject: Duel master cylinder conversion

Well, I have been rebuilding my brake system on my long term restoration of 
my once rusty 68k mile, $350.00, 63 standard bus. So I set up my 72 and later 
power brake duel circuit master cylinder to bench bleed, I put fluid in it 
started pumping the piston with a phillips screwdriver and fluid started 
moving and all seemed good when the fluid started to leak out the piston end 
around the seal, the piston has more up and down and side movement than it 
seems it should have. So it looks like I will probably be making a trip to 
the auto parts store to try to order another one hoping it will be better 
than the last.  Doug Lewis
