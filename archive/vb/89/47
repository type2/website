Subject: RE: [VB] redux/trans repair

   Welding up cast iron is not recommended in my book. I have a RGB trans in
my shop (today) that I just had to replace both axle tubes and RGB's due to
the PO trying to weld the RGB to the axle housing. What happens is the weld
is a different alloy then the iron and it cracked just inside the weld. It's
like trying to weld a exhaust manifold in a water pumper it's a band aid on
the real problem. Best to find an oversize insert and go that way. I have
NEVER had a problem with a HeilCoil in a RGB and I have used them all, Time
Serts, heil coils ans oversize inserts (like case savers). It's all in the
installation, Do it right it works, screw up and you'll have problems in the
future. As far as welding a nut on the RGB plug again shows a lack of
confidence in your work or the parts you're using. Most VW RGB's have gone
100,000 plus miles before a rebuild, do you really think you'll drive it
that much to do all the extra work for a just in case!

Ronnie,  try to do it right the first time

ps; To seal the plug right I always scotch bright the outside of the plug
and the inside of the hole on the RGB. I then put a thin coat of High temp
black RTV silicon on both areas before pressing the plug back in.
Be careful on removal as that when most problems occur, i.e.; tweaking the
plug.

Thanks for the good advice, once I got rid of those ridges the side
gears slipped right out.
I'll mess with the redux box end plugs later, I like the idea of
leaving a nut welded on to expedite future removal.
Can I weld up the oversize spring plate to redux box bolt holes myself
or does that require special techniques or equipment?
