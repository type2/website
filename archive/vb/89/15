Did you put the battery on a charger?  "Brand new" does not mean "full
charge", especially for 6v batteries which don't exactly fly off the
shelves at the FLAPS.  If it doesn't measure 6.3 volts at the terminals,
it's not fully charged.

How slow is too slow?  People used to start 36 hp engines with hand
cranks all the time.  You've made sure you're getting a spark, right?

Make sure all the battery cable connections are clean and tight.
Also check the ground strap at the front of the transmission.
The ground strap on my Bus was not so great when I first got it,
so I temporarily ran a ground cable from the battery negative to
one of the generator stand bolts (in addition to the normal strap
to the body).  This definitely improved the speed of the starter.

If you have a Bug this is harder to do, but you can try using half
of a set of jumper cables.  Don't use the red clamps at all - clamp
one black clamp onto the battery negative and the other black clamp
onto the engine someplace where it won't get knocked loose.  Please,
not on the carb, fuel pump, etc.   Leave the ground strap from the
battery to the body hooked up.  If this improves your starter speed,
then cleaning up or replacing the transmission ground strap will
probably help.

Good luck!
