  I am just saying what I have seen. POR 15 or any hard rust inhibitor would
probaly have the same reaction. What happened was the underneath had chipped
and allowed moisture to creep in between the layers of the POR 15 the rust
was undetectable looking at the floors. We found it because the floors
sounded hollow? When we poked at it we went through the floor. Chipping off
the POR 15 revealed a sandwich of rusted floor held together by the inner
and outer coats of POR 15. Now this could of all happened by the person who
coated it, I don't know. I always thought that POR 15 works by keeping air
from rust, thus holding it in a stalemate.

Ronnie,

You say don't sandwtch.  What is wrong with using POR-15 as an undercoating
underneath the bus, and then using the interior and painting over it while
still tacky?  Interior rust needs to be prevented, especially in the front
floor areas, and around the lower part of the bus  panels and floor.
