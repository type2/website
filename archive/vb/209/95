Subject: Inside Bus Dimensions

Hey everyone,

Does anyone have or know where I can find an inner floorplan with dimensions 
for a 1966 21-window deluxe?  I am sure there must be something out there 
(metric or standard) that gives all of the inner dimensions of a bus.  I 
need one for planning out my custom camper interior installation, and 
wondered if I could save myself the trouble of measuring the whole thing 
myself.

Thanks in advance,

Richard
'66 Samba
