 BlankHey -

 10 volts.  I had just  been messing with the
stereo....  Went for gas.  No start.  Jumped it,
 and it ran perfectly going home.  Drove for like
 twenty minutes, and when I shut it off, and turned
the key again...No start.  I charged the battery,
and it took a charge.<<

Kevin,
In messing with your radio, is there any way you may
have unplugged or disconnected the Gen light in the
dash?  Gurus, correct me if it is different in a bus,
but in my old 66 bug, if this light is not connected
to the alternator and then to the bulb in the dash to
make the circuit complete, then the Alt will not
charge the battery, causing precisely the symptons
which you describe.  When you turn the key on with out
cranking the starter, does the Gen light come on? If
not, then this is likely your problem.
Peace, John Baker
