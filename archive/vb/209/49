Subject: middle seat kick panel question

Hey volks,

   I just bought a middle seat kick panel for my 67 deluxe full length middle
seat, but it doesn't fit correctly. The guy I bought it from said that it came
from a 66 deluxe, did the seats change frmo 66 to 67? Mine has a bar that goes
from top to bottom that gets in the way of the mounting metal pieces.  Any
help would be very nice. I would also trade somebody this one for one correct
for my bus. This one is in awesome shape.
john
