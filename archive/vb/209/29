Subject: Re: [VB] NOS door - more pics

yup, that definately looks like it's for a pull handle door.  those are the 
right holes for attaching the early mechanism and handle.   
All I can think is that it was made later.   and was a combination of early 
inner parts and later outer skin.  One of those supercessions which are 
functionally no different but cosmetically is different.    

Which is why it is nice to look at the part number AND know what the part is 
supposed to be shaped like.  There are a number of parts that keep the old 
part number but are slightly different in the later versions.

 And the NOS door has the hole in the jamb for the door
 limiter/hold open, but no inside bracket for the
 mechanism
