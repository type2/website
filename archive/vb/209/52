At this time all I'm carrying is the POR15 by the quart (although I do
happen to have one single pint of the high-temp stuff if you want it).  You
can store whatever you don't use, but you must be careful to keep it as
airtight as possible, and do not let it come in contact with used POR15,
rust, or any other contaminents.  Do not, for example, let a paint brush
that is being used on your car come in contact with any POR15 that you plan
to save. And don't leave the can open for any length of time at all unless
you're planning on using it all up within hours.  Instead, when you open the
can for the first time, immediately separate what you want to use now from
what you want to use later, and reseal the latter as quickly as possible. As
long as you minimize exposure to air and other elements, the POR15 will keep
for a long time.  I once used some that I had leftover after storing it for
a year and it worked fine.
