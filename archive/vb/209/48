If he has a white switch with a light in the center be careful what you pay. There are repro's out there that are called NOS selling for around $75.00 when in fact, they are new! All you really need is a pre- 66 wiper switch. Post a pic of your heater and I can tell you if it's a '67 or not. I am using a porsche switch that has a built in bowden cable but that isn't necessary to have either.

Light travels faster than sound. 
This is why some people appear bright until you hear them 
speak.
