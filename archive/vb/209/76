I hate to differ, especially with an longtime listee :-), but the manual
definitely means 1/2" of *free play* at the pedal, before the T.O.
bearing lever is engaged. I broke cables almost every year until I
changed my adjustment. There is plenty of clutch throw in my bus, along
with about a full inch of free play (I get lazy).

The 1/2" of pedal free play before lever-engagement is not
much at all, compared with the full-throw travel of the pedal. It fully
covers more than enough travel to engage the clutch in any gear. I have
plenty of cable adjustment as well. Consider checking this out yourself
on yer bus. Just need 1/2 to 3/4 inch free play - I get away with a full
inch, and have more than enough clutch operation.

I assume we've just misuderstood the terms! The free play is at the pedal,
not at the lever on the tranny - *that* wouldn't work at all! ;-)
