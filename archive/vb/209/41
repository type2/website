Subject: RE: [VB] POR15 discounted at The Bus Depot

Ron, do you all sell the pint size POR-15 and POR-20 (high temp paint) as 
well?

Personally I can barely make it through a pint before it goes bad.  Even 
with the platic wrap on the top and refridgerated.  But I usually do not use 
much at a time.  YMMV

I love the stuff!  It is amazing and when applied correctly is almost 
impossible to remove.  John, were you painting on cleanish bare metal?  It 
does not stick well on top of other paints.

Take Care,
Adrian
