Hi Sean,
Certainly not!  All you have to do is jack up the front of the bus.  Remove 
the flex brake lines and then unbolt the front end from the body.  This will 
allow the front beam to suddenly to drop down and bend the heck out of the 
front shift linkage, and in turn allow the beam to be slid sideways to be 
worked on.  Of course doing this will require you to repair or replace the 
front linkage......
