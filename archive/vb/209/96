Hey Richard,
Don't know if this is what your are looking for . . .but I am rebuilding the
camper interior in my '67 Sundial.  I wanted to put a one-piece floor in,
with no seams, etc.  I found that if you use a piece of 5' X 5" baltic birch
plywood, you only have to cut a 2 inch by 5 inch strip out of the corners to
clear the rear wheel wells.  Fits perfectly otherwise, with no seams or
gaps.

Hope this helps,
Ed
