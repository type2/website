Subject: Re: [VB] NOS door question

Hm, I did look up the number in teh parts list, which said it was for before 
the vin in late 63 model when they changed the door.  But that flat spot is 
wierd, the pull handle doors don't have it.  what I' like is pic showing wher 
ethe door mech would attach. and where the latch bit sticks out to teh door 
jamb.  I mean, is it possible that VW created a one size fits all door later 
on?   wierd.  well, what mechanism fits it?

<< Hi clara,
 60-63 was my first thought, but then i noticed the flattened raised part , 
which was used on the
 later doors for the hole and handle tip mounting. Heres a shot of the door 
your thinking of, no flat
 spot for the handle tip:

 And heres the later door which i beleive he has, notice the raised flat spot 
for the handle tip to
 be drilled into:
