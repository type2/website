Has anyone had trouble getting the fuel out of the bottle at 10 or 20
degrees F?

I never gave it much thought.
In Texas LP feel tanks in rural areas are on top of the ground and appear
to work ok. We have some days in parts of Texas as low as -7 degrees (f).
My LP powered lift trucks always started and ran fine in very cold
weather (possibly the heavy high pressure tanks).
Not exactly an answer but an interesting question you pose.
