No, you do not want that much free play before moving the arm, you want that 
much free play before the TO bearing hits the clutch. 

 I have driven around for years with cable tensioned by the TO arm spring, 
and only broke a clutch cable once.  Actually twice, as the same one broke 6 
months later, probably because I hadn't greased it when installing it (doh!)  
If you have free play where you can wiggle the arm, pushing the pedal all the 
way down won't engage th clutch all the way.   Funny that, I don't break 
cables much, and don't install new ones when I get the bus either.  I tend to 
have a couple extras stuck behind the seat though.   I have snapped gas 
cables twice, and ebrake cable once, and it was the early e brake cable that 
was hard to find too.     But I can't deal w/o having an ebrake so I got one 
asap.   Average is maybe one cable death every two years.

Do other people find the cables snap more often?

 Woah! You need to have 1/2 - 3/4" *free* play before the lever moves, or
 you'll wear out your cable in no time. Cable must be loose for 1/2" before
 pulling lever. There's a mushy additional inch or so before the TO bearing
 contacts the pressure plate. Cable must not be under constant tension.
 'halfinch free play' at the pedal means free play, not lightly tensioned
 as compared with the tension when the TO bearing hits the pressure
 plate.
