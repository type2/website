Subject: Re: [VB] Drag Link/Center Pin

The beam would hit or pull the linkage if I dropped the beam? Hmm. (scratching head) I'll have to look at that again. So how do I get that linkage off? A well placed bar against the shift rod cup (where the actual shifter goes) and plenty of whacks from a hammer?
Where does one buy a reamer? What do they run? Or am i bettr of coughing up the $70.00 to rent the tool from Bus Boys?
