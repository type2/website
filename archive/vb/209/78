Adrian,

I have had no trouble keeping opened containers of it around for 6 months.
Always pour out what you intend to use, then cover the original can up-
don't have to seal it until you are certain that you are finished with the
day's job, but you do have to minimize exposure to air and moisture. Try
using it on drier days, so you don't seal moisture into the can. Use the
plastic wrap - I use two layers - and be sure to not damage the sealing
surface of the can when first opening it.  I have found that transferring
the contents of the smaller cans to an appropriately size Nalgene bottle
(plastic chemical-industry bottle, usually available in many sizes up to a
liter at REI outdoors shops - use the polypropylene white ones, NOT the
clear shatterproof Nalgenes) helps to control access and keeps the POR
just fine for months at room temprature. Don't over tighten the caps of
the Nalgenes - just firmly.

The whole idea is to minimize exposure of the POR to the air, and never
shake the stuff - stir gently when mixing the colored POR's.
