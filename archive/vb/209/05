Hi clara,
60-63 was my first thought, but then i noticed the flattened raised part , which was used on the
later doors for the hole and handle tip mounting. Heres a shot of the door your thinking of, no flat
spot for the handle tip:

And heres the later door which i beleive he has, notice the raised flat spot for the handle tip to
be drilled into:
