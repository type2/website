I second that.   In my 67 riviera I can't use the emergency lights... if I do 
a fuse blows... the nose is dented (PO had a challenged sense of the size and 
shape of the bus) and the wires are pinched in there.   Then again, follow 
the wires... you should have power from the big wire at the right hadn fuse... 
do you have a wireing diagram?

the electrical harness may be pinched. it comes up through the frame right
at the nose.
