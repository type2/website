Subject: use for bay back seat...

I redid the bottom of the front bench in my 61 using the padding and 
upholstery off the bottom of a 77 back seat.  I just put it on over the top of my OG 
thrashed real vinyl leatehrtte and ratty horsehair.  worked pretty well, feels 
so much better... the price was right. now I'm glad I didn't toss that seat.

anyone want a seat frame?  might be good for springs
