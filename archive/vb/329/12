Hi Tom,
We heard a story years ago that VOA in the late 1960s or early 1970s had a 
diesel AC bug that was stolen and abandoned by the thief when he could not find 
a gas station with diesel.  We have seen a show about two guys who took a 
Kubota tractor diesel engine, and stuffed it into a small British sports car.  
They were able to get over 80 MPG with the setup.  We sure would like to find 
info on that one again or some AC diesel engine and figure out if either would 
work in a bus.
