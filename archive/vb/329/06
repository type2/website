Subject: RE: [VB] 1967 into 1959

I put a '64 in a '59 and it was a bolt in proposition (same as a '67 I'm
pretty sure).  Changing a front end with 1-2 people is a P.I.T.A.
Get some friends when you decide to do it. Also while you have the old beam
out, replace the steering bushing.

Will the front end from 1967 bus fit a 1959?

Thanks for the help!
