Chuck and whoever else...

For the whole lowdown, you should browse thesamba.com forums....but here is
the brief summary...

Most everyone knows HDFred's 65 deluxe was stolen from a motel parking lot
during the BYOB/KP weekened.  Very og deluxe with tons of rare parts inside.

No leads for a while, but a samba.com member in Nor Cal sells a cheap 65
camper to some LA boys for something like 300 bucks.  Not long after the
seller of said camper gets a call from the police asking if he knows
anything about a stolen bus.  He knows nothing but decides to inquire more.
Turns out the buyers of the camper stopped on the way to LA, ganked the VIN
tags and dumped the bus north of LA.  Then they proceeded to try to tag
Fred's bus with the new VIN tags but were busted.

Fred knew about his bus being found for awhile, but had to keep it quiet
while they were trying to locate the parts stolen.

AFAIK, none of the vert parts have been recovered....

Excellent recovery story, and a happy ending for Fred and everyone else who
knows him.

Lock dem buses...
