Speaking of Fred, I and I'm sure many others were
surprised and happy to see he got his bus back!  Lost
a bunch of things off it, but they got 
the 21 back.  Finally a happy ending to a stolen bus
story!!

Could someone with the complete story of the stolen
Hot Dog Fred's Bus and the return of the stolen Bus
write to the list and share with all..I would love to
hear how it was resolved and WHO was responsible.
Oh ya..what about the stolen part off the pristine
Vert Bug?

Thanks in advance!
