Subject: Solved::63 1 ton rear drums wanted

Thank you all.
I called Wolfsberg West first thing this morning and they have the one year  
rear brake drums in stock.
they are on order and will be installed next week by Volksauthority, while  I 
am on the East Coast. 
BTW it is a good thing I did not try to drive from San Jose to the Classic  & 
OCTO last weekend. The brakes would probably have failed completely and  this 
does not have a dual master cylinder!

Sam, I  think Jon Furst might have a drum or two, BUT
Rachel has that option so  they might not let go of
them.

I think that Wolfsberg West or  somebody has them new
German, but at a premium ($150  each).
