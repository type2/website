running well.

I don't remember any of my batteries getting hot. I have a few thing
to check though. Is the battery connected correctly (cable that runs
to starter on + & cable that connects to body -) Are the
generator/battery/starter all 12v? How old is the battery? One more
thing I can just pull out as a possibility, is you have the voltage
regulalator hooked up, right? Muir has a pretty decent simple section
for testing this stuff.

just the distributor. the + will get power from the ignition switch,
and feed anything additional on the engine (like fuel solenoid and
elec choke)

the barrel nut? or something else
