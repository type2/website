Subject: 40HP motor parts and Hot VW Mag's

Building a new 40HP motor for my 61 Double cab.  Going
thru all my parts to try and piece it together.  A few
parts i am in need of.  Can anyone help out.

Stock distributor.  VW part # 113 905 205, 205A or
205B
Right and left side lower front (of engine) tin.
Main lower pulley.

I have a stack of old "Hot VW's" & "VW & Porsche" from
the 70's & 80's that need a good home.  Not looking to
get much for them just find em a home.  They are
getting closer to trash can and.....

Thanks
