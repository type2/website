Hi Eric & Barb,
  The "Kubota tractor diesel engine... stuffed ...into a small British
sports car" is from a set of plans that were available from Mechanix
Illustrated back in the early '80's to build car called the Urba Centurion,
where you built the body out of plywood, Styrofoam, and fiberglass and
mounted it on a Triumph Spitfire chassis. The 17HP 3 cylinder Kubota diesel
engine along with the Triumph manual transmission with overdrive reportedly
yielded 85 MPG at 55MPH, and over 100 MPG at 45MPH. The plans were developed
by Quincy-Lynn Enterprises and are actually still available at:

   Don't know anything about an air cooled diesel VW.
