Subject: Re: [VB] 63 1 ton rear drums wanted

ya... those rear brakes are bad...I think out of the adjustment screws is all 
the way out... like past the threads, which worries me it could pop out of 
the star.  And that drum is really stuck on the shaft.   don't drive it except 
to Volks Authority until they are sorted out..  the other side rear drum we 
pulled off and Ray measured it, finding it's out of spec, but you can still use 
it in a pinch.  
unfortunately the 1 ton 63 rear drums are hard to find and not repopped.

My 63 singlecab has the 1 ton option so it has small nuts on the big nut 
tranny with 1 ton brake shoes.
The rear drums are now out of spec so I need good rear drums for the 1 year 
only special.
Can anyone help please?
Clara (Claralw(-at-)aol.com & Ray at Volksauthority) know the details but I think 
I have it right.
