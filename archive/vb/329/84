Subject: helphos spotlite

Hi Folks,
recently aquired a helphos spot light. Neat little gadget, hangs on your
split's windshield with a vacuum device.
Unfortunately it came with no instructions. I'm not sure how to change the
bulb or service the light.
Don't want to break something while trying to "fix it."
Wondering if someone might have instructions or manual for this guy. I could
borrow or pay owner for a copy?
Perhaps someone knows of a web site?
Thanks in advance,
