Hi  Folks,
recently aquired a helphos spot light. Neat little gadget, hangs on  your
split's windshield with a vacuum device.
Unfortunately it came with  no instructions. I'm not sure how to change the
bulb or service the  light.
Don't want to break something while trying to "fix it."
Wondering  if someone might have instructions or manual for this guy. I could
borrow  or pay owner for a copy?
Perhaps someone knows of a web site?
Thanks in  advance,
Mike Turner

no luck any how a bit more searching on google and
