Subject: Bumper needed

Got rear ended by a 16 tear old driving the Soccer mom van and now I need to
get another rear bumper!  the SC is a 66 and if you can help me it would be
appreciated!

He hit right on the bracket and because I have a Rick Taylor hitch just the
bumper was messed up and not the whole corner!
Thanks for your help
Rob
