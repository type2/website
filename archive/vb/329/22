hey all!

my engine finally runs!!!!

   i put the engine in, hooked everything up (except battery) and now i have some more questions.

1.)  when i cranked the motor over, the battery got hot, is this normal? (go easy on me, im 16 and my 67 is my first vehicle)

2.) what could be causing the battery to get hot if it isnt normal?

3.)  what wires hook up to the negative side of the ignition coil besides the distributor wire?

4.) does anyone have an accelerator cable clip i could get?? i fabbed my own, but i dont know how long it will last.

thanks in advance, and thanks to everyone who helped my bus get running.
