thanks for the replies. i guess i had everything hooked up correctly. the battery got pretty warm when i cranked over the engine. i guess im just nervous because it is my first time starting the motor up. i need the thingie that connects the accellerator cable to the carb. the brakes have been fixed a long time ago, and are rock hard. im hoping to take the bus for its first drive since 1985 today if my mom will ever go out and buy my fuel line! thanks again for your help. if someone has an extra clip thingie, my address is
