i dont have the idiot guide or the bus manual yet, i use old chilton books. i polarized the generator like the  e-mail in the archive said to, and the oil is a little bit abouve the full line. the lights go on and off, on when i turn the bus on, and off, then a few seconds later, on again, then they go off, then on, then off when i turn the bus off. and its a slow off and on, like the lights slowly go out, then slowly go on. the engine was just rebuilt, and was even torn down to double check everything, then rebuilt again. i will change the belt tightness to see if it helps out or not. thanks for the replies,
josh
