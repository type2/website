Subject: Type-2 Library: Call for Submissions

Volks,

I'm finally getting around to adding some technical articles to the 
Type-2 Library.

New additions include the Bosch FI manual, the Loctite FAQ and 
spreadsheet, Heat Noise Rust and VWs, and the bentley index.

If there are any postings in the archives or other technical articles 
you'd like to see in the library (or that you find useful) please let 
me know.

Submissions I'm looking for:
	- maintainance schedule spreadsheet/PDF/html:
		if someone could throw together a spreadsheet that
		is a grid of things to service at different mileages, a checklist
		of sorts, that can be printed out, I think people would use it

	- buying a bus checklist: things to immediately fix and/or check
		prior to buying

	-tranny FAQ: what tranny will fit where and/or gearing of various 
years/codes
		
If some of that stuff exists in the archives, and someone can point me 
to it, that'd be great.

Similarly, if you've got tech articles you'd like to see in the 
library, please point me towards them.

Ideas for better organization of the library (i think it works pretty 
well, but there might be a better way to reference/index stuff) are 
welcomed, but don't get mad if they aren't implemented.

Thanks,
