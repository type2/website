Subject: Bus Dead

My bus took a minor hit to the front end yesterday. Enough to dent the license
plate as someone was backing up and didn't see me.
The engine stalled when I was hit and now everything is dead. I turn the key
and nothing happens, no click, or anything else.
Anybody know what to look for?
I have no lights, or ignition or any electrical function.
thanks in advance
John Flowers
