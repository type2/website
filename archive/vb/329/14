Hi Volks,

First off, let me point you all to the backup website... We've been 
experiencing technical difficulties with the new web host but expect to 
have them ironed out very soon.

Please visit http://www.geocities.com/busesofthecorn for BOTC info 
until further notice.

This year there are Volks coming in to BOTC from all points of the 
compass, with planned appearances from members of the Buskatiers, Full 
Moon Bus Club, The Bug Pack, the Ohio Valley Tribe, and others. It'll 
be interesting to get these clubs competing in the "Bus Driver's 
Competition" on Saturday afternoon and see who really is best behind 
the wheel. Eager competitors may want to start practicing their reverse 
slalom skills now....

Saturday will have something for everyone:

Burrito Breakfast - Everyone brings an ingredient, see the website for 
details.
Type2 Parts Swap Meet -- No charge for registered campers to sell or 
swap!
Tie-Dye Workshop - Bring your own items or buy a shirt on-site.
9-hole Frisbee Golf Course,
Kids Scavenger Hunt on Saturday afternoon
Cornroast and Pot-Luck supper (Corn included with registration, please 
bring a side dish or dessert.
Saturday Awards, Door prizes and Campfire. Bring an instrument!

Come for the weekend or just drop in on Saturday. Either way we'd be 
happy to have you attend. Thanks to generous sponsorship by 
GermanSupply.com it's just $8 pre-registered or $10 at the gate.

BOTC (and related VW design) T-shirts are also in the works, I have 
arranged a T-shirt order Co-ordinator and will have design and pricing 
specs available soon.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
