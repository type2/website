Subject: 63 1 ton rear drums wanted

My 63 singlecab has the 1 ton option so it has small nuts on the big nut 
tranny with 1 ton brake shoes.
The rear drums are now out of spec so I need good rear drums for the 1 year 
only special.
Can anyone help please?
Clara (Claralw(-at-)aol.com & Ray at Volksauthority) know the details but I think 
I have it right.

TIA
