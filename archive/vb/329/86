Subject: Friday: Shaeffer Pen Display

I was at a jewelry and gift shop the other day looking for a nice pressie for my wife when I spied a counter display for Shaeffer Pens with a woman and 2 children in a split screen bus. 
I had to look hard at it to begin because it only had from the bottom of the windsheilds up to just over the roof lip with but, sure enough, it was a 15 Window Deluxe as it had no roof windows as far as I could see but did have the plexiglass rear pillar windows. 
Plus the big steering wheel was a dead give away. 
I'll try & scor a pic next time I'm down there.
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
