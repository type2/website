crossbars,

> and sheets of plywood, or put them to the back for luggage. A shop in
Eugene
> had them for about $150 (ouch).

> So, as we are looking this guy walks up and asks us what we need, he was
the
> local Yakima rep. He asked for what car, and I hate that, 'cuz as soon as
> you say "63 bus" you lose 'em. I told him and he pulls out their new
> catalogue and IT HAS A SPLIT BUS ON THE COVER. It belongs to Yakima's CEO.
> There are risers that attach to the ones on the Montero, $40 for the set.
> Everything I wanted for a third of the price.
