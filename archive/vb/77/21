Subject:  [VB] Are you raising the front of your Bus?

I'm looking to lower the front of the '63, and looking for drop spindles or
complete front end.. My 18 year old Son wants to drive away in the camper
this summer but wants it lowered first. The back already sags pretty good.
Anyone in Northern California looking to get rid of one?  Lloyd in Eureka,
Calif  Who wants his Son to drive away in a Splittie! Remember you never
forget your 1st car.....
