Hi Gary,
Sounds like you got a set of improperly hardened spring leaves, or some Joker 
figured out he could aneal (soften) them and get a lowered ride with less 
risk.  You might just want to invest in a new or proven good used set to get 
it to ride correctly.  Do be carefull with coil over spring shocks.  We have 
seen them tear off the upper rear mounts on due to being too stiff!  Eric&
