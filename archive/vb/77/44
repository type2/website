Subject: Re: [VB] Final verdict on oil hemorrhage

Hi Rich,
As to what wieght oil you should be using depends on how cold the weather is 
i your area.  We use 30 Wt Castrol oil and only rarely does it get below 20F 
here.  It has gotten as low as -6F, but that was freakish.  Because we run 
oil pressure guages we can monitor our RPMs in the first few minutes to keep 
the oil pressure well below the 80Lbs. mark.  Also we run the thermostic 
bellows system that warms the engine up quickly to the proper temp range and 
keeps it there.
  Having the wrong, especially aftermarket oil pressure springs can really 
change the oil pressure.  One engine we bought from a rebuilder we trusted 
showed way too high of oil pressure when we started it up.  With some study 
of the charts that show the original relief spring length in Bentley Official 
Service Manuals that cover 1971 bus or the 1971 and later bug, we were able 
to sort through our collection of these springs to find the correct ones.  We 
replaced the rear one and only got the oil pressure down to 60Lbs. in 70+ 
weather!  Then replaced the forward one and Walla Walla Washington the oil 
pressure became normal!  Turned out the relief springs that had come in it 
were high pressure after market ones.
