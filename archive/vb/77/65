Subject: Front Suspension Question (big pivot thingy)

Ok, I unbolted the '64 front suspension to put in my '60.  Very easy, got it
out (had to cut the shift rod, but other than that it was ok) without
killing myself.  Noticed one problem though. On the lower beam, there is a
pivot pin(I don't know the exact name, so please bare with me on this), dead
center.  On the '64 beam, it has about 1/16" of slop in it.  I've look at
Wolfsburg west, and a few other places, and I don't see any parts for this.
Has anyone had any experience with this part being loose?  I unbolted the
arm from it, and slid out the huge pin, and it is worn both on the brass
bushings, and on the pin itself. Before I bolt this suspension onto my '60,
I want it to be right.  So please, any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks
Charles
