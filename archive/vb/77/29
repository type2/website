I have a mechanics jacket with my name embroidered on it.  Seems fairly 
common wear at VW shows, so I don't feel like a dork wearing it.  But once, 
when I didn't have the jackety on) I was identified at a Sac Bug-o-rama by a

listee from No Cal, when I was asking about a triangle bracket.     His 
reasoning was if a woman was buying a triangle air cleaner bracket, it had
to 
be me.  At least that time he was right which I find kind of odd.   Then 
again, if you are at a show and see a guy asking for kamax bolts, you might 
think it was David.    It is funny meeting listees, as often I find that I 
did have a picture of them in my head, and they are usually not like my 
picture.    Good people, though.

 Yeah,  but then the person wearing the thing looks like an even bigger dork
