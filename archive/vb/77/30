Subject: Re: [VB] Are you raising the front of your Bus?

Hi thanks for the offer, more info: '63/1500 combo, I want to keep the 5 x
205 pattern, AND the stock front end, I'll put it in the shed with the
original wheels and hub caps, I've got a '64 front end from a parts bus and
would like to put drop spindles on that beam if I can't get a  deal  on a
complete one that is all ready done... Lloyd in Eureka, Calif
