Subject: OCTO- Stolen Bug

sorry if this is more bug related, but i did lose a bunch of very hard to
find splitty westy parts as well.
rachel's bug was parked in the corner spot in the church parking lot at the
corner of 17th and adams, catty-corner to and visible from the octo show
(which was great except for the car getting lifted). it had a repro bug
woodslat rack on it, and the framework for a westy rack attached to the bug
rack. the rest of the disassembled westy rack was inside the car, covered
up, as well as a box of 55/56 westy parts (in a girl scout cookie box), a
digital camera, some of our clothes and 2 jackets/coats, a repop hazet
tooklit (empty) which was won at the octo raffle, a new wiring works bug
harness was in the trunk, as well as all of rachel's id, credit cards,
etc... plus some other misc vw parts. there is no front license plate on
the car (yes, she knows), which may be a good way to spot it. we are also
going to call the church this morning to see if for some obscure reason
they had it towed off, but we were somewhat assured that they don't do that.
if anyone there saw anything happen to the bug between 11am and 1pm (we
went back to the car to unload clothes and parts), please call the
huntington beach police (714-960-8811), or please email me. please check
out the link to see pics. 
a big thanks to P & C and Roger Nang for all their help yesterday.
