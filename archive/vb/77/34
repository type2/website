>what is your pre heat system like?

i have what i guess is a slight mishmosh... mostly FI.

i have the little thangies that cover up the heatriser/muffler junction,
the ones that go just in front of the riser tube and screw onto the
cylinder tin. FI stuff, i think,
i have a FI doghouse with the thermostat and flaps; tho due to a likely
tweaked fulcrum on the righthand flap, the flaps never close more than
halfway. you can't move the thermostat enough on the bracket to close em. i
twisted the fulcrum into a better shape oncet, but once tweaked they tend
to stay that way - the curve has to be   j u s t   right for the flaps to
work properly. need to get another flap set!

have a preheat hose going from the pushrod area on the right side, up thru
the rear tin, and into the early-bay aircleaner's preheat snout. the
aircleaner has a little thermostatic pushrod for the main intake flap, and
i adjusted it to be nearly closed... thermostat might not work, looking for
a spare one. tho that would just be a prob in summer, really.
the rear tin has an extra, 1/2" hole just in front of the preheater hose,
which i think is another FI doodad that i don't have/need? so i gotta plug
that hole.
heat riser has the two gaskets, little hole one on the left.
seals have seen better days, and are needing replacement, but are 90% there
- 1" hole on left side where it meets the apron.


so basically i have a COMPLETE, if needing-adjusted,  preheat system.

need to straighten it out before it gets damp/cold again...
i had ice above the throttle plate... hell, the carb bolts had ice on em!
was kinda cool, in a physics-demonstration way.
