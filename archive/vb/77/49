Hi Jon,
If you are using a 1600 with the larger air cleaner with the cyclone air 
cleaner your jetting is probably off.  For a 1500 Vw listed:
Main jet           117.5
Air correction   135z  (Even the 1500 with stock air cleaner used this size.)
Pilot jet            g 60
Since you are running a 1600 which will make more vaccum just below the 
venturi than a 1500, our best guesses are:
You need the same or slightly smaller main jet than the 1500.  
Definitely bigger Air correction jet.
Smaller Pilot jet.

It sounds like your Air correction jet being too small and Main jet a little 
too big is causing to rich of mixture especially at high RPMs.  Then when you 
drop suddenly to lower RPMs the engine almost floods out.
