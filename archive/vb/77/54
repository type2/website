Subject: Cant get Tie Rod off

Subject line pretty much sez it all!!!!

The ones on the driver's side came off just fine.  However the one on the
passenger side (the one that was bad) wont budge.  Ive beat on it, shot it
full of WD40 and I even used nasty words.  Still no luck.

Ideas????

Thanks in advance!!
