Subject: Re: [VB] Shipping buses overseas, please help.

I'm shipping a car from California to the UK next week. Cost is $700. About
$500 less than it costs to go coast to coast in the U.S. go figure. Your
friends price will vary depending on where he is. If he's on a coastline he's
good. If the cars needs to be transported inland (middle of the U.S.
afterward) the cost will go up dramatically.
