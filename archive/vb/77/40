Subject: Re: [VB] 67 Spring Plates, 4 lug brakes, and early front suspension questions

when I undid the lowering job on my 59 I used 67 spring plates and tranny
from a wreck, so it should work fine. I neede a front tranny mount adapter
but I think the split case tranny went away in 59, so you shouldnt have to
bother with that. If it uses late model type 3 drums(think thats what they
use for the type 1 kits) you can use the early 5 lug type 3 drums if you can
find them.
    I also put the 67 front end in the 59 and it was straight forward, bolts
right in. freakin heavy and hard to manuver though, get friend or two to
help.
