If you are not willing to help the public out then you are either a
wholesaler only or you will be going out of business.  Technical help is
part of the job.

I think you could go either way on this.  But, if you have a website and you
put an Email address on it then, surprise surprise, expect Email.  I sent an
Email to a guy trying to buy about $500 worth of stuff and he said I wasn't
serious cause I didn't phone him.  Well what the F* do you list an Email
address for then?  Anyway, if you have a website and only want it as an
advertisement and not as a means of communication then state how you want to
be contacted and when, including time zone.

I'll agree with you here.  Your customers will tell you when you are too
high.  I think you need to have a general idea but in the end you have to
price off of your overhead, not theirs.
