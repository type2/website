I think the slide has been evident for a while.

But Ellis ... when you come back to your senses,  remember we're still here.

 DON'T be ridiculous, pregnant wife and a two year old... <as if!>
 
 After over twenty years of living a lie, I... um I... well I~ I can not go
 on
 with the Aircooled charade any longer!!!!
 Well OK, it's not like I have to hide it or anything. People will talk and
 call
 me names and wonder what I have been up to all of these years. I may lose
 friends. I may even lose my job and have to attend a 'spethial' church on
 Sunday, but I am OUT and I am proud I will wave the flag high and sthrut my
 sthuff with pride! Flannel shirts, wide men's leather writhst watch bands,
 hiking boots and if necessary act BUTCH at Denny's! (oh my goodness) I know
 that there are those of you who will support my cause and take up the
 "staff"
 that I carry ahead of me. I, um.... I, ah... <blush> went WATERCOOLED this
 week.
