Subject: Shipping buses overseas, please help.

A friend of mine is looking into shipping a bus over from Italy.  I am
hoping somebody on the list has done this before and 
can give me some advice.  approx costs, best shipping companys, any thing
special I might need to know.
any help is always appreciated.
