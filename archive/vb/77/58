Hi Rich,
You do not mention where you are hammering on it.  Trying to pound it 
straight out does not work!  We have had good luck hitting the part the tie 
rod end goes through.  This momentarly distorts the taper fit that is 
designed to lock the two parts together and pops the tie rod end loose.  This 
should work with the nut loosened or off and only three or four hammer hits.
