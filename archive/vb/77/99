Subject: deluxe trim "custom" options

Thinking way ahead here...

I've got a deluxe bus that...at least right now...I'm planning on doing 
mild custom resto. I'm not a real big fan of the deluxe trim. Other than 
leaving it off, what custom touches have you seen done for deluxe trim. 
Pictures would be great.
