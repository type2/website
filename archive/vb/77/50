Subject: Inside front door handles

What year did they switch from the roll pin attachment to the screw through
the handle attachment??

My 62 has the mech. with the threaded mount, but someone took the older
handles and drilled a hole through them and bolted them on.  I want to put
the correct ones on.

Thanks.

Steve
See ya tomorrow :-)
