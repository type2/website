Subject: 67 Spring Plates, 4 lug brakes, and early front suspension questions

I found a 1967 bus that some guy had that was cut into a dune buggy of sorts
(Hey it wasn't me!).  Well, my question is, it has a complete IRS kit for
the rear suspension.  Are the spring plates the same on the '67 as my '60?
Because I already bought the kit, I just got to go unbolt it. There is
another problem I noticed, the drums are 4 lug.  What can I do to convert
these to 5 lug (without wheel adapters)?

Also, I have a complete '64 front suspension and would like to put it in my
'60.  How hard is this, and what do I need to look out for?  I have all of
the brakes, and new drums for this later beam, and would really like it if I
didn't have to go out and pay $140 for new pre '64 front wheel cylinders.

Thanks
Charles
