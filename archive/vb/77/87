Hello all

While we've been waiting in Cairo for our Libyan visas to be
issued, we've been busy bods ...

We have extensively updated our website. We have revamped
the gallery pages and added about 100 new photographs, from
Malawi to Egypt. And we've also added lots of new links on
our links page, with a new heading, "Friends of the
ZebraSafari" -- you may even be there!

Check it out at:
www.zebrasafari.co.za

Love
Christian & Gisela
