Subject: Re: [VB] 62 front wheel cyl. rebuilds????

Hi Byran,
1955-67 front (Rear cylinders were differant from the fronts, but we think 
they were also same diameter pistons though the same time period.) use the 
same size pistons.  Check out Hemmings magazine for brake cylinder 
rebuilders.  They should not only have the parts for your rebuild. You can 
also have them bore your old corroded OG MC or wheel cylinder/s to a larger 
diameter and press in a brass or better yet stainless steel tube into the MC. 
 Resulting in a rebuilt cylinder and alot less corrosion in your future!
