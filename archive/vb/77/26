 Whichever of these neat methods you choose, I suggest using
 thread-locking fluid when screwing in the stud to the case. It'll seal and
 hold the stud in. I've managed to do this twice in my VW-life (29 years),
 and each time the locking fluid helped insure the repair.
 
 Be sure to make the thread surfaces oil-free before using the fluid.

Iv'e wondered about that.  what style of threadlocker do you use?   the wimp 
strength for tiny studs?  the green stuff from locktite?   

I have had the studs come out with the cap nuts sometiimes and that bugs me, 
but I remember someone advising against loctiting the oil studs to the case.
