Hi Ttackman,
With threaded fasteners this is a good trick because the wax can and will 
work it's way in due to capilary action, lubricating the parts!  The problem 
with tapered fitted parts is there is a gass tight bond keeping them 
together!  The old roller bearing cranks are actually made of many segments 
tapered fitted to gether to allow removal & replacement of the roller 
bearings.  Heating the spindle is a bad idea due to possibly anealing 
(softening) the part damaging it for future use!

The only problem with those is they almost always damage the tie rod end, 
especially the rubber boot on there.  The factory press out tool is like a 
C-clamp, but goes around the tie rod end allowing it to pop out..  We were 
fortunite to find one made in Brazil.  
  As for being concerned about a hammer bending the spindle arm.  We really 
doubt that using a standard hammer (Do not use a BFH or sledge hammer!) will 
bend it any amount more than hitting a pot hole will do.  But if you have two 
hammers at hand it couldn't hurt, and may force more impact into momentarly 
deforming the tapered fit hole.      Eric&Barb
