first: sure, technical help is part of the job, but not the sole job or
responsibility of the vendor. one of the absoulte WORST things i can
remember about working parts/phone was the occasional customer that called
every 10 minutes and discussed the problems they were having, and how what
i (or others) had suggested didn't magically fix the problem. sometimes
fixing something over the phone is like calling the doctor and saying "i'm
sick...what's wrong with me?"-just not realistic.
yes, some assistance is ok, and is usually gonna happen during normal
talking, but to talk someone through a detailed or precision job isn't
good, and again can get the person working in more trouble than they
started with.

second: good point about the website for advertisement purposes.
third: and very true about customers letting you know about high prices! it
happens. and if you are low on something, customers tell their friends!
