Hey folks, I've waited all week to post this one.  Let me start with =
saying I thing Spears is a Bimbo (rich one).  My Son thinks she's the =
greatest, boy does he need to get real.

Anyway, Monday morning on one of the network Morning Shows, she was be =
interviewed about the past weekend.  The interviewer ask her which of =
the Pepsi segments (spelling?) was her favorite.  She said the 70's one =
and "we had a little Winnebago Car on the set, and they even let me =
drive it".  So the VW Bus is now a Little Winnebago Car.  She could have =
at least called it a Camper Van or something.

Dave
