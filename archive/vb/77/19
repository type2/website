DON'T be ridiculous, pregnant wife and a two year old... <as if!>

After over twenty years of living a lie, I... um I... well I~ I can not go
on
with the Aircooled charade any longer!!!!
Well OK, it's not like I have to hide it or anything. People will talk and
call
me names and wonder what I have been up to all of these years. I may lose
friends. I may even lose my job and have to attend a 'spethial' church on
Sunday, but I am OUT and I am proud I will wave the flag high and sthrut my
sthuff with pride! Flannel shirts, wide men's leather writhst watch bands,
hiking boots and if necessary act BUTCH at Denny's! (oh my goodness) I know
that there are those of you who will support my cause and take up the
"staff"
that I carry ahead of me. I, um.... I, ah... <blush> went WATERCOOLED this
week.
