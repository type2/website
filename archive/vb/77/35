    Well I'm leaving in a few minutes to OCTO, no sign or word from Richard
aka Rustybus. I will probably pass them going the opposite way.  
    Look for the www.volksrescue.com truck pulling a trailer with the Modern
Cleaners 15 window Deluxe on the trailer (ouch, trailer queen?)


see those going there   ronnie

ps; I won't be back till Tuesday
