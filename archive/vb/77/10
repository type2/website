Subject: Re: [VB] Buying bus parts

10,000 parts and I am expected to know them all before I turn a wrench
on my bus? Uh... no.

first: if you don't know what a part looks like or what it's called,
why
are you even working on the car in the first place? maybe you should
be
taking it to a shop.

for 4 years i worked at a parts counter at a very busy vw shop, with
over
10,000 parts in stock at any given time,
