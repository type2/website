Subject: Headliner Help

My 56 Kombi didn't come with a  headliner and I really haven't seen that
many, can someone answer some simple questions:

1) Are the headliners fabric white with holes, like a 67 Square back?  The
reason I ask is that I put a headliner in a square back once.

2) Do the headliners have wires/rob that hold them up?  Can I buy new ones
somewhere?

3) Besides the material and maybe wires what other hardware is there?

Any other advice?

Thanks,
Wayne
