Subject: Kitty comes home

Hi,
I could've written a long email and put all the links
in but I decided to keep it simple.
If you're interested in seeing the latest chapter in
the saga of my 67 Aussie panel go to:

http://geocities.com/kombi1976
 
Click on "Kitty The 67 Splitty" on the right scroll
bar & then when the next page comes up scroll down to
"July 2003 - Kitty Comes Home" & click on this.
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
