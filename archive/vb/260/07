Hi - I have a complete motor I pulled out of a bus that by using Tom 
Wilsons book, I've determined to have a type 3 1600 case.

  My question is, If I were to buy a standard rebuilt 1600 longblock, 
would all of the cooling tin, fan shroud, and other stuff bolt and 
screw back on?  I thought I had read that after a certain year, cases 
became "universal".  Before removing the engine, everything seemed snug 
and in place, and looked correct.

I'm at the bottom of my learning curve regarding engine stuff, as my 
Westy I recently sold had a freshly rebuilt motor which only required 
routine maintenance, so I'm starting from scratch as I attempt to get 
the 60dc out onto the road.

Thanks for any help
Don J
