Subject: solder question

When I worked as an alarm tech, we were given a small soldering kit with a butane powered "iron".

I've only soldered with this arrangement, and never really learned any technique, per se.

Is there more to soldering than just smearing the solder around on the two pieces to be connected till it looks good? 

Or did I just expose my grave ignorance publicly?

Billy
