It depends upon whether or not any moisture got to the bared metal before
you primed. It's in the air everywhere. I would have immediately treated
the bared metal with the blue phosphating solution found at your local
auto body supply house (not PepBoys), rinse it, dry it. Then apply your
paint system (primer and topcoat). The phosphate protects the metal for a
long time before you even need to paint. During my resto, there was a car,
totally bare, that they treated with phosphate years before, in the
corner, with a tarp over it, with no rust anywhere. But since the chemical
layer is extremely thin, don't scratch it at all before you paint/prime.
