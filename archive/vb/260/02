Subject: Beginner's Mistake...Help!

Hi all, (Cris Torlasco here, from Susan Dolvin's computer)

I am in the process of installing a borrowed engine to my 66 Westy to make it to the 
Seattle Vintage Meet this coming weekend. Everything smooth, EXCEPT I didn't pay too 
much attention when unplugging wires, and now I can't figure things out. If this was 
a regular bus installation it wouldn't be such an issue, but my bus has an extra 
electrical box next to the voltage regulator (Bosch, 6V unit, part # 0 332 003 016)to 
and from which several cables go. I have lost track of what goes where, and I am only 
30 hours away from leaving to the Vintage Meet!
So the questions would be:

-What exactly is this part? Could it be an additional part for Westfalias? Susan's 66 
Dormobile has something very similar, but not quite the same shape (hers has two 
cylinders next to the voltage regulator).

-Which wire goes where? The wiring diagrams don't show this additional piece that I 
am aware of, so I am lost...

Any quick help will be most appreciated, and will help another split window bus to 
make it to the Vintage Meet!

Thanks!!!!
