Clara,

What I did during my restoration, was to bead blast the pole, treat it
with POR Metal Ready (or equivlent blue phosphate solution from your
friendly auto body paint supply house), rinse, dry, spray POR-15, and then
spray a light coat of system primer at the three-hour point, when the POR
was still tacky. This is the typical POR procedure. When it was all dry, I
applied my topcoat. Results? Nine years later - no scratches or
penetrations thru the topcoat, the pole looks like the day it went back
in. Nice and clean.

It's work, but the first person to see my resto back then, looked into the
cab and exclaimed - "your steering pole is so clean!!!"
