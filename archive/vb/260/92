Subject: re:soldering fuse box

Was writ:
"Some dimmer switches can need soldering where the male electrical tabs are
riveted to the dimmer switch body to help prevent another voltage dropage
area."

I just looked at my dimmer switch, and it doesn't appear as though I could
do any soldering to it, unless I took the switch apart. I think I asked the
list about this before-and no one had taken one apart, although some
suggested purchasing a new one.
