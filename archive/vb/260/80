I take them to about 80 ft lbs with my 16" breaker bar - for me
(thin, weak), that's a good firm wrenching. Get you a $20 Sears dial/arm
type torque wrench, Craftsman, that goes to about 150 ftlbs, and calibrate
yourself to the 80-90 ftlb requirement, using a 3/4" or 19mm socket with a
1/2" square drive, and the 16" Craftsman bar. You'll be surprised how
little effort it takes to get to 80 ftlbs.

Be sure to use anti-sieze lube (Permatex/Loctite silver type) on the
threads, and they will come undone next year without hassle. I've been
using anti-sieze on them for 25 years, never had a lug get loose on me.

If you check the fit of a good lug in your old drum, if the fit is firm,
then you may not have damaged drum threads from the shopmonkey. Use good
judgement, as you don't want the lugs getting loose on you.
