If it's true that he has no undercoating, and just surface rust, etc, then
a good degreasing and washing and a careful drying of ALL areas inside and
out, would prolly be the ticket. If it were mine, I'd be brushing it down
with a stiff brush as well, to insure getting all surface crud off, before
applying POR. Once you apply POR, you're blind to the surface forever,
unless rust forms underneath it. I'd also let it dry forever - at least
two weeks in hot dry weather. But that's me!
