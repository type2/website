Yes, I have a '66 and it's a one-year only generator.  It's a larger 6V that's 
the same diameter as the 12V models and it takes the same fan belt as the 12V 
(905mm circumference). The 6V generators through the '65 model year should take 
a 900mm long fan belt. The Bentley manual is the only place I've seen this 
acknowledged. Most parts mail-order catalogs like RMMW, if I remember 
correctly, would have me buy the too-small fan belt for my model, lumping all 
6V generators together.
