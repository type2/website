Subject: Re: [VB] Headliner Help

yep, should just be primer in the rear. I would try acetone to remove the
glue. I managed to get some kind of clear sealant or varnish off the outside
of my 21 window with acetone that the PPO's grandkids had applied at random
on the rear of the bus, came off pretty easy after being on there for 20
years or so.

I do think those front headliner panels are sold new, I'm sure if you check
around you'll find some.
