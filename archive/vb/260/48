Mount a flashing LED from Rad Shack next to the switch. They're bright,
and you're less likely to forget to turn'em off. Since you only use the
backup lights at night, the bright flashing LED won't go unnoticed. The
flashing LED has the flashing circuit built into the LED, so it's just
the size of a standard 1/5" diameter LED. They work directly from 12
Volts.
