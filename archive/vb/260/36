Subject: Westy interior light wiring/location?

Ok I finally getting close to painting my interior.  I'm running wires for
speakers and lights in the back.  My "camper" started life as Kombi and has no
wiring for the side lights that go between the left side windows.  Does the
wire for these come in from the top on a Westy?  I thought it be open above
the post for wires but it's not.  I'm going to get one of those angle heads
for my drill and drill through.  My concern is that the channel doesn't go all
the way down.

Also anyone willing to measure from the top of the paneling to the bottom of
the light for me?  That way I can get them close to right location.

Dave
