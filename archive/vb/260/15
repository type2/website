Along with what Eric&Barb said,

The flaps, when opened fully, will also direct more air over the heads where
it is needed. Air flows like water, it takes the easiest route. Since going
past the cylinders is easier, thats where most of the air goes if you do not
have the flaps installed. The heads are a mess when it comes to air flowing
through them (compared to the cylinders), and need the flaps to help direct
air through them.

On my engine, I run the thermostat and flaps living here in northern Utah,
and ran them when I lived in Las Vegas. I've even gone one step further, and
blocked off the stock oil cooler, and run an external oil cooler with a
thermostat to bypass when the oil is still cold. My engine basically has no
cooling until it is warmed up. Works very well, my bus actually has heat by
the time I get out of my neighborhood on cold winter mornings, but the
engine can be driven as hard as I want in temps over 100 degrees without
running head temps over 375 degrees at the most.  :-)

Thermostats rock!
