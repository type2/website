<< My 56 Kombi didn't come with a  headliner and I really haven't seen that
 many, can someone answer some simple questions:
 
 1) Are the headliners fabric white with holes, like a 67 Square back?  The
 reason I ask is that I put a headliner in a square back once.
 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

actually, 63 and earlier came with cloth headliners.   I heard they are 
easier to installed the vinyl.  I think vinyl was an option in 63, and standard as 
of 64.  
Various kinds are available repro. 

there are rods that go through the headliner and hold it up.  If it also 
tucked in aroudn the edges.    I have extra headliner bows.   Never installed a 
headliner myself, but if you did a squareback I bet you can do a decent job on a 
bus.

 2) Do the headliners have wires/rob that hold them up?  Can I buy new ones
 somewhere?
 
 3) Besides the material and maybe wires what other hardware is there?
 
 Any other advice?
