Use a resonator pipe and tip off of a bus muffler, then run another pieces
of pipe up higher then the bus

Here is a air cooled engine question for those that are much smarter than I.
I have a tecumseh powered 5000W portable generator that is louder than I
like
(ear plugs anyone)  I have the muffler that they sell, It did not help much.
I was wondering if anyone has modified a car muffler to fit on these
generators?  I am using this at the Volkfest show, In Yakima, wa,  to power
my
mobile espresso unit(it's in the 58' panel)  Sorry for the off topic, but it
is Friday.
