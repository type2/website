Check with your local garden tractor and riding lawn mower shop. They have or
can get what is called "hush" mufflers. Our 18 hp Briggs Vanguard on the
hovercraft made a lot of noise until I fitted it with one.

Here is a air cooled engine question for those that are much smarter than I.
I have a tecumseh powered 5000W portable generator that is louder than I like
(ear plugs anyone)  I have the muffler that they sell, It did not help much.
I was wondering if anyone has modified a car muffler to fit on these
generators?  I am using this at the Volkfest show, In Yakima, wa,  to power
my
mobile espresso unit(it's in the 58' panel)  Sorry for the off topic, but it
is Friday.
