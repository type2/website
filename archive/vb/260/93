Subject: Re: [VB] Broken tank stud on truck

I had to do this when took out the tank on my DC to refurbish it.  Both 
of the old studs broke off when I tried to remove the fasteners holding 
down the straps.  So I sawed off the remains, drilled out the stubs and 
retapped the holes so I could stick in some generic studs I had in my 
parts stash.  Worked out just fine.  The original stud may have been 
welded in, but in the end it didn't matter.
