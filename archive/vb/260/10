Hi Don,
Universal refers to the engine case having the rear hanger bolt holes cast in 
it so it can be also slung into a 1968-71 bus.  As for the type 3 engine case 
that came out with the 1500cc engine in 1961, and this size engine was not 
availible as an upright till 1963 for bus!  The only problem to converting these 
to type 1 & 2s usage is the oil pressure idiot sender is in a differant 
place.  As for your 1960 DC any 1300-1600 engine case will bolt up to your 
1300-1600 tin if it is upright style, will fit just fine.
  Do get together a doghouse shroud system for your new engine and install 
the thermostatic flaps system!
