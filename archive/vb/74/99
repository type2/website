Support straps against vibration and extension to at least the end of the
bumper. If it works, I'll order a set.

I've decided to attempt to have custom exaust tips fashioned for my stock
bug muffler. Each tip will be ported off to each side. I think that a stock
bus muffler will have too much back pressure for my 1641cc. Two reasons: (1)
only one tailpipe as opposed to two, increasing back pressure (2) the stock
bus tip narrows at the end, causing even more back pressure. Anyone have any
thoughts on this idea?
