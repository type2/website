Objet : [VB] Still looking for a mirror


I am still in need of one old round mirror to restore.
 I found one (thanks Everett) but need another.  Does
anyone have a extra old original round mirror that is
restorable?  I do not care about the glass.  Just the
housing.  There had got to be one out there.

thanks
Matthew
