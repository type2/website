 On an old 1600 DP engine I'm working on, I have discovered that one of the 
holes where the studs that hold on the oil drain plate is stripped out.  So 
would you either: 1)Re-tap the threads with the next bigger size,  2)Put some 
sort of heliocoil in there (if so what, how, where do I get it) or 3)Just 
deal with the 3 inch puddle of oil that collects under the car where it is 
leaking around this stud.  All the other holes around the drain plate are 
fine, so I can tighten it down ALMOST enough with these other nuts to stop 
the oil leak, but not quite all the way.

you can get studs that are the regular size one end, and slightly larger the 
other.  you careful tap out the hole to the larger size, and instert one of 
theses studs.  it'll take the nut  exactly the same.  careful not to leave 
metal shaving that get into your oil.  I bought some of these studs for about 
25 cents a piece at a swap sometime, just in case
