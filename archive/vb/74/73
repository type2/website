I always put the seam down on the copper intake manifold gaskets, been doing
it since 40hp, but I couldn't show you anywhere in print that it tells you
to do it that way.

i'm installing new intake manifold gaskets on single port heads. what is
the general concensus on which way the seam faces when installing the
gaskets, facing up so you can see the seam, or facing down so the seam is
on the head?
just curious as to how others do it, because i know i've put them on both
ways, but it's been a while and i'm paranoid.
thanks,
jon
