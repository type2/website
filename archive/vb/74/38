Subject: RE: [VB] Worlds longest rebuild?

I started my supercharged 36hp okrasa project close to 1 1/2 years ago... it
sits on the engine stand.  Then again, this motor is for my ghia which
currently runs and I'm really trying to get my dc on the road so maybe I
can't really count a full 1 1/2 years...  Plus it's fun to putz with it on
occasion when the mood strikes.  I did meet a guy at a party this past
weekend who used to be a certified VW mechanic and I showed him a few
goodies I had around the house... his eyes lit up, so maybe he'll help me
out to get motivated.

Problem is I can't loose focus on getting the double cab on the road this
summer... too many of you are complaining that it's taking too long.
Hopefully on Sunday, people will have all types of correct little nuts and
bolts I still need at octo. :-)
