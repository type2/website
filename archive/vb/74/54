Subject: manifold gasket help

i'm installing new intake manifold gaskets on single port heads. what is
the general concensus on which way the seam faces when installing the
gaskets, facing up so you can see the seam, or facing down so the seam is
on the head?
just curious as to how others do it, because i know i've put them on both
ways, but it's been a while and i'm paranoid.
thanks,
jon
