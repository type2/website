Hi Ray,
Is that the top side of the rubber stops you mean?  Congrats on getting the 
steering to work!

If the trailing arms are that badly bent you would be able to tell from 
looking at the Bus shop manual photos.

Does your front end have the lowering adjusting parts welded in the center of 
the front beam?  If so you need to jack up your bus and install jack stands.  
Then adjust the front suspension so the wheels end up as far down as 
possible.  
  If the DPO removed some of the spring leaves the remaining leaves could be 
snap, crackle, popping and ready to let the trailing arms to pop out of the 
front end while you are driving!  If sprong leaves are missing then you need 
to remove them and install new ones.   Eric&Barb
