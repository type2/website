Subject: VW's new ad

   This a probably a Friday subject but I'll forget by then, so here I go.
  I was watching the tube and a new VWoA commercial came on it showed a
cartoonish bug and a Split Bus. Then went on to showing the new Beetle and a
Jetta, then the commercial went on to say Things to Come? and showed a
silhouette of what looked like a bus!   
   Are they priming us for the NEW Microbus, VWoA does own that name as of
November 8th 2000
