He's probably just lazy or burned out & just wants to get something for the 
stash. He's probably made his money back on the stuff and doesn't have any 
cash into any of it at this point. So just trying to get some kind of cash 
and turn it over to someone else to mess with makes most sense. It's a lot 
of work to hustle and part out old cars. Sometimes people just get burned 
out and finally decide to dump it all. I definatly wouldn't be turning my 
nose up at it though. Even if the busses are all "parts" busses, having 
someone pull the stuff and sell it is what keeps our drivers on the road. 
If it was closer to me, I'd probably go have a gander. A little too far and 
too much work for me. I'll stick with west Texas where the VW's don't rust 
away....they just get hacked to make dune buggies and deer blinds!
