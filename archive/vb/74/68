Subject: single wheel trailer???

Beto,

I checked out you webpage, and I really dig your single wheel trailer. What
can you tell me about this? Who made it? How does it mount? How does it feel
behind the bus? I would love to learn more about that little guy! Thanks for
any info you can pass on!

Alex Vieira
