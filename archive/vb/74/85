During the winter I have a 1 amp mortorcycle battery trickle charger on all
my vehicles. When it drops to freezing I just run out the extension cord, no
real problems. Shouldn't affect your bus unless you have wiring problems.

Hey everyone,

Is there any danger to hooking up a battery charger overnight without first
disconnecting the battery terminals? Would that hurt the charging system at
all, or is it safe because the ignition is switched off? Just curious....
