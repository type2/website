I agree, but we ought to have a lapel pin, too.  Or
some way to identify ourselves while wandering around
shows.  Orange hats like P&C?  I've been to lots of
shows where I had no idea who the listees were.  And
then I read later that someone was there.  At my age,
even the guys I know should have name tags!  I
remember you though, Beto.
