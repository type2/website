Subject: i need rubber

help! i need the lower pieces of front door rubber channel for the sliding
glass window. they must be the ones for the glass with the metal frame
bottom, which the rubber has a wider groove for the metal to fit into
(non-hole-through-the-glass latch type glass).
all i care about is that they are not cracked to h*ll and that they are
fully useable. i don't care about the felt, as i can deal with that. i
think the part numbers are: 211-837-387B and 211-837-388B, which are for
the laminatd glass. NOS anyone?
thanks, i hope to be able to open my windows someday soon.
jon
