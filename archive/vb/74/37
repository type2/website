Subject: fresh 40hp

Speaking of engines,
I built a fresh 1200 40hp about 7 years ago for one of my hovercraft. I
later opted for a 12 volt 1500 beacuse of the accessories I wanted to use.
Anyone on the left coast, probably nearer Washington state interested in a
nice clean fresh painted (can I talk this up anymore?) 6 volt 40hp engine,
minus exaust (cause I was using custom on hovercraft.)

Probably will need to be taken down again for inspection. Been sitting on my
shelf for 7 years.
