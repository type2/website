Subject: RE: [VB] Scarcity of parts

This happened to me when scrounging parts to go back from lowered to
stock, since I had no OG parts to work with. Wound up buying a whole
rear for 250, then getting that rebuilt.
Transaxle Engineering claims to have these parts. This was big nut stuff
I was after.

   Is it me or are the parts for our VW's starting to get even harder to
find?
   Today I called to get some end gears, fulcrums and a few bus axles
because I'm out and the last refurbished set I let someone else use. So
I call my usual supplier and they said SORRY NONE, I knew axles were
getting hard to find, but end gears and fulcrums, come-on. So after
calling all of my usual sources, with whom I've never had a problem, I
get the same reply, SORRY NONE. So as a last resort I call another
vender who I hardly use and they had some fulcrums and end gears. The
weird part was they asked me if I wanted good, better or best. Say what
I asked and there response was that swing axle parts are getting so hard
to come by they ask how GOOD of a part you want!.
  The next step was asking them for bus axles, they almost fell over
laughing, you want what. I said I wanted some bus axles for RGB's, again
I was asked good, better or best, I almost fell over. So the conclusion
I came to was start buying up all I can as RGB parts are getting as hard
to find as 36 hp parts.

ps;. I took apart a bunch of my stash of RGB trannys only to find a
couple good (usable) parts pps;. They do MAKE oversize fulcrums so I can
send in all my damaged axles to be surfaced for these. ppps; I asked
them if they had any BUS hockey sticks and was told, reconditioned for
40 dollars, new 100 dollars OUCH
