Subject: RE: [VB] What exhaust should I use?

One of the problems with jetting exaust to the rear of a bus instead of the
side is airflow. Airflow studies show that the exaust vented to the rear is
sucked up by the air flowing over the rear roof and is dragged to the side
in mini vortexes. Some of this exaust air actully gets sucked into the fresh
air intakes along the side of the van puttin carbonmonoxide laden air into
the fresh air system and your heating air. VW did these studies back in 49
and many have been done over the years, but that is why you see factory
exaust on vans and trucks vented to the side and down. That's why bug
exaust, even if you modify the rear apron so the two tubes can clear, will
not work on a bus.

I'll agree that a  bug is different than a bus but i
believe that the tests were done on a bench and not in
the car (in the book at least)though I haven't looked
at that book(or any of Bergs for that manner) in days.
I have tried both and use the stock exhaust but i can
remember my header set-up running just as well if not
a little more peppy. I thought exhaust didn't really
come into any real importance until you got into
really changing the configuration of the engine;
Larger valves, bigger carbs, porting ect. It is
interseting in your case. I assume that the motor runs
good and cool. I'll keep that in mind as i plan to run
a 1776 in the future.
