Subject: Re: [VB] round to square regulator

A chart I have detailing the correct original components for the Beetle from
the VVWCA shows the Round Regulator was used through Engine # 1-1120614,
Chassis # 1-0929745 for the Beetle  (end of '55 model year).

I tried to cross-reference "Progressive Refinements" but found no listing.

I have always heard the round regulator referred to as 54-55 only.
