Subject: RE: [VB] Listee stickers? Hydrex VW?

Or we could make a special 'black sheep' squadron sticker for non-west
listees.. :)


Visted the bus holed up for winter in the garage today, lovingly turned
engine by hand to move the good stuff around. PA salty sandblaster in
full swing, the roads are white with the stuff (not snow).

Has anyone had a VW painted and/or welding done by Hydrex VW of Emmaus
PA? His website mentioned lead work, and many years of experience. I
need some front floor work and paint done, and NC to the metalwizard
might be too far a drive for me, unfort... Any experience reports?

Thanks,
AL

Rich,
You are correct sir.....cut vinyl stickers.......likely a
'vintagebus2type2.com' and a simple bus graphic.

There seems to be some interest,  If it keeps up this way...I will post
more
details...work something out for our non-west listees., and post some
artwork
or a sample pic.
