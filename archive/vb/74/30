If you could get it on a transparent background, I would be interested.

Subject: [VB] Listee stickers?


Hey everyone....I hope this isn't considered a friday topic...but here goes.

While washing the back window of the bus yesterday, I got to thinking about 
the old v(-at-)l sticker Crusty Van Bondage had put on the 63EZ before I bought
it.

I really enjoy meeting new listees at the shows...but since there are so
many 
of us, and no real way of recognition, I'm thinking of this-
Would there be any interest from the listees on a small simple window
sticker 
stating 'vintagebus(-at-)type2.com' or something to that effect??
Something visible enough to see in a bus back window.
I have a friend who can make vinyl stickers for me and for real cheap.  I
was 
planning to sell them at shows for cost and maybe a buck or two to go the 
list fund. 

If there is interest, then I can have a batch made and take them to the OCTO

show.....and we can see if this flies.

ADMINS:I checked the archives and list rules.....It seems like this should
be 
ok ....am I correct?

Let me know..and I'll get to it.
