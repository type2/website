Agree with Ray on this one. I am thinking that it would look something
like this, with the appropriate text of course:

I do these for another site (guess which) and they are about $1.50/pair
in quantity. Beto, is this what you're thinking about?

If you could get it on a transparent background, I would be interested.

Subject: [VB] Listee stickers?


Hey everyone....I hope this isn't considered a friday topic...but here
goes.

While washing the back window of the bus yesterday, I got to thinking
about
the old v(-at-)l sticker Crusty Van Bondage had put on the 63EZ before I
bought
it.

I really enjoy meeting new listees at the shows...but since there are so
many
of us, and no real way of recognition, I'm thinking of this-
Would there be any interest from the listees on a small simple window
sticker
stating 'vintagebus(-at-)type2.com' or something to that effect??
Something visible enough to see in a bus back window.
I have a friend who can make vinyl stickers for me and for real cheap.
I
was
planning to sell them at shows for cost and maybe a buck or two to go
the
list fund.

If there is interest, then I can have a batch made and take them to the
OCTO

show.....and we can see if this flies.

ADMINS:I checked the archives and list rules.....It seems like this
should
be
ok ....am I correct?

Let me know..and I'll get to it.
