Yeah,
I frequently post and read RAMVA and remember that whole issue going.
They're main problem was that they had both the word 'Volkswagen' and the VW symbol on the logo...plus used it as their website logo.  It all started with the website and snowballed from there to the stickers.

I plan on using neither.  Just a simple bus graphic and 'vintagebus(-at-)type2.com'

We'll see what happens.....they say stop...I stop.  They say nothing....then I'll just keep keepin on.  =)
