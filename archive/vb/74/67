Subject: Re: [VB] Worlds longest rebuild?

Steve,
Ok, I'll fess up: 2 and 1/2 years and still counting!! I'm going almost the
same route as you, EVERYTHING balanced, but pretty much stock 1641 SP with
doghouse and full flow oil filter (not a filter pump, but it will be full
flow). It's mostly been procrastination and perfectionism, they go hand in
hand you know.... The engine can't blow up on me and make me look foolish if
I never finish it! ;^)  I'm really trying to get it done for this summer
though, as I'm sick of going to CVBC campouts on my BMW motorcycle and
getting ribbed by everyone there. I did pick up a '77 Westy yesterday for
$1500, so at least I'll have that to camp with if I waste yet another
year.....sigh,,......

Alex Vieira
3 busses, 1 BMW, 1 Audi, 2 Treks, a Bianchi, and,hmmm...........0 SO's! Go
