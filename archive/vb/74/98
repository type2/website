I wouldn't count on any stated release dates for CD manuals from Bentley.  
I'm waiting for the EuroVan CDs to ship any day, but they have been promised 
for over a year now.

Bentley changed CD formats and discontinued any old format CDs, including the 
Vanagon.  The new format is only Windows 98 - on compatible.  The old version 
was Mac or PC.  Some vendors may still have the older versions available.
