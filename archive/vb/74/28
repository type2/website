Subject: Re: [VB] steering & suspension

My high mileage '67's front suspension almost sits on the stops.  I was
sure that there must have been missing or broken torsion leaves to cause
this problem and I was surprised when I pulled the whole thing apart and
found everything was there and nothing was broke.  I turned the leaves
around and installed them upside down thinking that if they torqued in
the opposite direction that this might help.  It made no difference.   I
use coil over front shocks in order to pick up the front end.  The ride
quality is poor compared to my low mileage '66 westy!
