I have one that I think is original.  Give me your address and I will send
it.  The mirror is hazy, but I get the feeling you are going to restore it
anyway.

I am still in need of one old round mirror to restore.
 I found one (thanks Everett) but need another.  Does
anyone have a extra old original round mirror that is
restorable?  I do not care about the glass.  Just the
housing.  There had got to be one out there.

thanks
Matthew
