Subject: RE: [T2] solar trickle chargers

That looks pretty neat. I was wondering about any sort of charger.how do you
guys use them? Originally I was just thinking of using something to keep
battery topped off when not driving. If you get one of these larger units-is
that so you can use the radio while parked during the day? Or are these
charging enough so that you can use your lights at night, and any other
auxiliary power stuff at night, but then re-charge during the day? Wouldn't
the batteries re-charge anyway when you drove around?

 

I'm sorry for the ignorant question.but I don't get it.
