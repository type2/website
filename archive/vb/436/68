Subject: Body repair in Phoenix

Hi All,

I'm attempting to locate some VW experienced body guys in the phoenix
area that could replace the corner on my 67 microbus. The guys I know
have a long list of people in line before me (we're talking months
out) so I'm trying to expand my circle so to speak. I have a donor
corner and "most" of the damage has been straightened/pulled out, the
remander of the repare is beyond my metal skills. I am trying to do
this correctly. There isn't a lot left to do fortunately. :)

If anyone knows some one in this area that could help with something
like this I would be grateful!

Thanks in advance!
Bob
