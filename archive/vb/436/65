Hi all,

After about three months in the body shop for a slow but steady body
work/restoration, the dis-assembled shell of my '59 Double-Cab was finally
painted on Friday afternoon. Here is a link to a theSamba.com "what did you do
for your Bus today" thread  (page 507, towards the bottom).

All of the other removed parts including the cab doors, (both) deck lids, the
side and rear gates, bumpers and logo, etc., etc. should be painted on Monday,
then everything wet sanded and buffed out in the weeks to come...

Enjoy, I'm exhausted and heading to bed...
