Hi Clara,

 

I figured the metal ones were the old ones, as these were buried pretty deep
in his stash of parts. Thanks for the confirmation.

 

Thanks also for the link pins advice and encouragement, I'll read the
Bentley again closely.I do know your mantra - "grease is good" and I do
fairly regularly lube the front end. I just never knew the link pins were
supposed to be adjusted. Glad to hear it is an 'easy' thing to do.

The rubber seals for the drums are a modern replacement of the metal ones.

wheel bearings should be cleaned and inspected at the 30k mile service.

brakes should be adjusted every 6k miles

 

link pins should be adjusted every 6k miles.   It is very easy.   You do
need to jack the bus up so the wheel are off the ground.   You also need a
17mm open end wrench.   There are instructions in the bentley, and in the
Muir book. 

I would grease the suspension every 6K miles as well.   if not at the 3K
miles.

  I like to loosen the link pin pinch bolt, pump some grease in, wiggle the
link pin back and forth a little to kinda squish the grease around, then
adjust it and snug the pinch bolt.   

 

grease is good.
