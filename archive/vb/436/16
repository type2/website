Subject: RE:6V heater in 12V bus

Just to update.I got impatient-it is getting cold here, and they have not
put any salt down yet ;)

 

I hooked everything up-and it didn't work. I then remembered that after I
converted the bus to 12V, I think I turned the heater on without thinking-so
I think I may have burnt out the relay. I swapped the relay with one I had
on another heater. I wired it up - and fired it up, and it was cranking out
some good heat pretty fast.

 

Now I need to pull the engine, so I can reconnect the duct work between the
blower and the interior. The original duct work connector was rubber, and it
basically disintegrated. I saw Stan of "Stanagon" fame used some flexible
duct, looks like oversized flexible dryer duct. I may go that route..

 

Anyone else have suggestions on making this connection?
