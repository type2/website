Not for 14" wheels.

I didn't research the 15+" wheel options since I wanted to keep it 
stock-ish.  Nor the other-than-wide-5 bolt pattern options.  :)


Quick poll:

How much interest would there be in a rear disk kit to fit redux boxes and 
14" wheels?  Say $1500-1800 bucks.  (looks like a high probability of 
having to have hubs built, and at low volume that's going to push the 
price up a lot...)
