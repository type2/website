Subject: Cheap VW Parts

All,

A good friend of mine, Eric Eisenberg, is closing up his VW shop in 
Delaware.  And when I mean "closing up" I mean "throwing out lots of 
wonderful VW parts".

So, if you need old VW parts, and you have the time to get them ASAP, 
you should go by and pick some up. (and offer him something to close to 
market value)  Seriously.  He's throwing things out everyday.  Please help.

Contact me and I'll put you in touch.

My only caveat: please don't flake or don't blow him off.  And please, 
if you can, take stuff that he's going to scrap anyway to help him have 
to deal with less...

Cheers,
    Tom
