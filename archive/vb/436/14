Subject: 6V heater in 12V bus

Sorry for the quick 2nd post, but I may have answered my own question.
Instead of looking at the wiring diagram, I looked at the actual circuit
board (or whatever it is called) and see that one of the posts is labeled
"LOAD". There are two wires going to this single post, one connects to the
blower pump, and one connects to the vent blower thermostat. I think I just
need to connect my voltage drop between this post and the two leads. 

 

I'll give it a shot, and let you know. Then I've got to find my t-fuel
connector, and somehow connect the blower to the duct going into the bus, as
the original rubber connector disintegrated.
