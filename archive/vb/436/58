I remember No Quarter.
He and some buddies showed up at the Classic in Irvine, CA when he was
going hot and heavy on buses. They drove all the way from where ever 
it was in the midwest (North or South Dakota??).
I was running ads in Hot VW's at the time and had a pass to their tent 
for lunch so I invited the Boys to
join me. Had a nice time. Nice guys.

Workin' on installing my FI.
