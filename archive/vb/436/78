Background. Had a couple of splits when solo. Honeymooned in a '76 ASI Camper. Rolled it. Bought '80 Westy, had it 14 years.

I really like the somewhat self-contained sink/stove/fridge cabinet from the Vanagon era. So much so, that when I was searching for a split, I was going to buy just the cabinet, make it completely self contained so it could be removed when not camping. Full width bed and use bags and packs for gear instead of cabinets, more room overall. Obviously a pop-top with bed above.

As for a vehicle itself, I had an '80, which was air cooled. Check the Vanagon list for current stuff, I've been off for years, but have heard that the Go-Westy folks make a great stock engine.

I really liked the Vanagon, I just wore mine out commuting 100 miles a day and not doing much camping with it. Sold it at 350k miles.
