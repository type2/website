Subject: Rust VEto 342

Hi Guys,



Have any of you used this product  Rust Veto 342? It can be applied with a
regular garden pump sprayer, it goes on clear, and then dries to a hard waxy
surface. Supposed to be great for undercarriage application. When it dries
it is an amber color. I think my bus had that.



Here are a couple websites with info on it  cosmolinedirect.com and
http://www.schafco.com/cosmoline.asp



I have recently gone back to finish painting the underside of my bus. I had
done about > of it with Master Series(which seems like a great product). The
way I had my bus jacked up before, I was unable to get to the middle
section. Originally I sandblasted the underside, two coats of Master Series
Primer, and two of Chassis black top coat. I just checked my recored, and I
did this back on 2005.



The middle section which I am in the process of doing right now-I wire
brushed, as I could not get  a sandblaster. It looked amazing under the dirt
and grime. And it looked like it had some sort of undercoating on it-a waxy
type, not rubbery. Im putting the second top coat on today.



The more I think about my bus, and the more money, time and energy I spend
on it-I realize I want to drive this thing year round. I know Ive got to
deal with salt in my environment-but this Rust Veto 342 looks like a good
product.



Any thoughts, experience etc.?



Thanks,
