Go price out a complete front brake rebuilt (shoes, drums, wheel cyls, and 
hardware) of your favorite quality.....  Let me know if you find any new 
drums available at any price....  and $260+ for a set of german wheel 
cyls.... $180 for brazilian drums that don't actually fit perfect, $100 
for a set of german front shoes (though I bet those are all long gone. 
the two sets on my shelf will stay there...).  adds up quick.

and at the end of the day you still have to adjust them every few thousand 
miles (and I dunno about you, but my knees are not what they once were!) 
and hope you've got the magic to get them tweaked so they don't 
pull.....and in 5 years, the cyls will need to be rebuilt again anyway. 
and they'll have puked fluid all over your shoes.......
