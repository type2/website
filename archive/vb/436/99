Subject: Re: [T2] looking for advice on a new camper

Well here is the update. I was able to get a VERY cheap ticket to LA, so I
can check out the bus myself. The owner seems very upfront, he has sent me a
lot of photos, and given me a lot of info on it. Explained everything I
think I should be asking-and it sounds like the bus for me and my family. My
wife is super excited about it too-she was the one telling me to go for it.

 

I'm flying out to LA Tuesday, going to check it out. If it is as good as
explained, I'll finish the deal. Then I'm driving it up to some friends
outside San Jose. I'll park it there for a few weeks, as I need to go back
to Boston for work. Then I'll fly back a bit later with my wife, and we'll
drive it back together.or rather together for a week or so-as that is all
the time she can get off work. I'll finish the drive myself. I'm thinking
maybe 2 week trip across country.maybe 3. Depending on when we actually get
to make the trip.

 

I had to go for it with the bus, as there was another buyer, and he could
not wait. If it was really badly represented, I'll just lose my deposit. If
it is as represented, I get to see it up close, and take it for a short
jaunt to test it out(LA to San Jose) before making a longer trip. 

 

So tonight, I pack up some basic tools for the trip, along with my VW books
(Muir & Bentley), a few books for some travel reading. I'll try to plan my
mini trip in the bus. Wish I had more time on this trip-but I'll take what I
can get. I guess I'll try to get one night camping in it.;)

 

I'll report back soon..thanks for all your advice and tips.
