Hey Kevin and all,


Be wary of using plastic ducts, it may stink when heated up.     Metal ducts,
paper tubes might be better.

Check your fuel lines.   Just like on the engine, fuel lines on the heater can
get old and crack and start leaking.

I really like a gas heater, I guess I am just a wimp.  :)

Just to update.I got impatient-it is getting cold here, and they have not
put any salt down yet ;)


I hooked everything up-and it didn't work. I then remembered that after I
converted the bus to 12V, I think I turned the heater on without thinking-so
I think I may have burnt out the relay. I swapped the relay with one I had
on another heater. I wired it up - and fired it up, and it was cranking out
some good heat pretty fast.


Now I need to pull the engine, so I can reconnect the duct work between the
blower and the interior. The original duct work connector was rubber, and it
basically disintegrated. I saw Stan of "Stanagon" fame used some flexible
duct, looks like oversized flexible dryer duct. I may go that route..
