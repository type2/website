Subject: disk break question

Hello all!

I have a 67 microbus that I am getting back on the road. I am thinking
of converting from drum to disk. I'm still in the thought process part
and wanted to reach out to see what other people think on this topic.
What would be a good vender (who wouldn't break the bank). If it would
even be worth it? I could just as easily stick to drums.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Bob
