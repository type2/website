Subject: Mail archives searchable again - now with tech library content

Sorry for the delays, but the mail archives are now searchable again. They
are updated as of October 10 of this year. Additionally, you can now search
against the Type2.com technical library at the same time. My best guess,
there's about 180k items indexed in total. Please forward/announce anywhere
else it may be useful. I will "attempt" to update the archives more often
as well.

Enjoy

Peace,
