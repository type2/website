Subject: Re: [VB] disk break question

68/69 beam with arms, later disc spindles, 924S hubs, stock bus caliper with a
70 911 rotor. You get Porsche pattern, narrower front track (jig ground the
inner bearing stop on the spindles).

Although I stopped there and mounted Fuchs, a set of adapters would give back
those stock steelies without pushing the wheel out.

It's been on my crew cab since 1995.

For the rear, somebody is being lazy. It seems a 71 - up bus/vanagon rear hub
should work. Make a caliper bracket and plop a rotor on.

The problem is more likely that not enough people with reduction boxes wants
rear discs. Mine is IRS and had type 3 on it. Changing that out for either 914
or 944. Might look funny with only vented rears, so maybe the 914 kit is
better.
