Subject: Re: [VB] disk break question

You actually can do it, but it's not simple. I put a 78 beam in a 65 
years ago. I used the old top two bolted mounts and welded some 
piston pins to the frame for the lower two (this was high school, 
long before I knew about hard metals). I don't remember any width 
issues, just the larger vertical beam mount spacing. So it can be 
done. I also swapped the rear frame on that 21 window (if I had only 
kept it). The van sat high, was great off road, and the caster was 
slightly reduced making it more touchy on the highway.

Thanks for the disk brake review, just what I needed. I'm planning 
the baby stang ones for the old green bus as well.
