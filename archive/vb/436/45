Not much choice since no one makes a rear disc kit that will work with 
redux boxes.   If you lower it w/ type1/type3 axle and modified swing 
arms, you can use type 1 rear disc brake kits.    if you want to switch to 
baywindow IRS (stock or lowered) you can get the kit from CE - but it 
won't work with 14" wheels.


As far as I can tell, I'm the only one currently working on building a 
redux box setup.  But not quickly, since it's far far far from my day 
job... ;-)
