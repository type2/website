It's start, but not the complete solution - the bearing-to-nut spacing is 
different on a split, plus you're going to need to move the wheel mounting 
surface inboard to get room for a wide 5 adaptor.  then you've still got 
to hang a 5x112 rotor in there, and clear it all with a caliper...  It's 
on my list of possibilities.

there are non-redux bus (bay axle) solutions for big brakes (won't fit a 
14" wheel on them) that use 944 rear assemblies (complete with drum 
ebrake).

and dunno if you've noticed - but late bay parts aren't much more readily 
available than split parts now.  so using a late hub as the basis for a 
kit just seems like a supply problem waiting to happen....but as I said, 
it's on my list.

Anyone want to loan/sell me one or two to experiment with? :)   I've 
pretty much speced out the rotor possibilities, it's just a matter of 
finding the right fit.

Yeah - that has been the problem in the past, when parts were more 
available and we owners were all younger and didn't mind adjusting every 
few thousand miles... ;)   And a crusty daily driver split bus was sub 
$5k.  Now, if you find a runner for $15k you got a steal.


I'm not saying the turning point has completely happened, but I think the 
(stock rear axle) market may be opening up a bit.  The fact that there are 
at least 4 different turn key front kits for bus 14" wheels out there is a 
good start...
