I had a 62 camper when my kids were small, I got a 1970 bay window 
camper later, and then updated to an 87 vanagon.

The 70 has a single cot in top and is great, but the vanagon has a 
double cot in top and is a way better appointed camper. The only problem 
with a Vanagon is the fuel consumption, 15 mpg!

The bay window was great and I went to buses by the bridge at Lake 
Havasu for many years in it. The Vanagon is slightly bigger, walk 
through, has 110-propane-12V fridge, better heater, AC and would be my 
choice for camping yet again.
