motor from a golf,jetta vanagon.  these have different poles on them to  
give the 4 speeds needed for the blower, the center pole is 6V  later   md

Sorry  for the quick 2nd post, but I may have answered my own question.
Instead of  looking at the wiring diagram, I looked at the actual circuit
board (or  whatever it is called) and see that one of the posts is labeled
"LOAD".  There are two wires going to this single post, one connects to the
blower  pump, and one connects to the vent blower thermostat. I think I just
need  to connect my voltage drop between this post and the two leads.  



I'll give it a shot, and let you know. Then I've got to find  my t-fuel
connector, and somehow connect the blower to the duct going into  the bus, 
as
the original rubber connector  disintegrated.
