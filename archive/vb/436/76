My Dad had a 86 ish vanagon westy for some years.   He sold it a copuple years
ago.
It had a propane fridge, and a gas cooker buildt in.   The kit was quality
made.   Comfy to camp in, full pop top.   A little bit faster than a split, a
bit less milage, bigger inside.     Automatic with air conditioning.  Quieter
than a split.

My mother in law really is more of a stay in hotels type than a camper type,
and they ended up not using it much.   He would go camping in his thing with a
tent.    I borrowed it a couple times when they drove out to BBB and stayed in
a motel, and I flew out and used the camper.

The idea of buying one in Ca rather than Boston makes a lot of sense.

Different years have different camper kits, so check some out.   There are
lots of campers in the classifieds on the samba for browsing pictures.

Just get one ready to go.

or get a roof rack and pile some gear on top of the splitty.

Well I've had my '65 Ez-Camper for almost 15 years now. It has been great. I
have really given my heart in soul and wallet into it the last few years. I
used the camping aspect for road trips, and it was my daily driver until
about 6 years ago. About 3 years ago I took it off the road, and spent a lot
of time and energy into restoring it. There are still a few minor things to
do.but it runs well, the body and interior are in great shape.everything is
great.



The only down side - my wife wants more room.
