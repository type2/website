Subject: Re: [VB] Heater tube insulation

Well I was able to take the insulation off, I don't believe it is asbestos-
the grey insulation actually still has a yellow stamp on it- it says Fatege
Glas. Pretty cool script. 

 

What I can't quite figure out is along the length of it when installed-it
seemed like it was sealed, almost like a zip-loc. But I don't imagine being
able to seal that again, after taking it off and cleaning it. I guess I
could use some tape of some sort. The main pipe was actually fairly solid in
the middle, but rusted out at the ends, I guess water was getting under the
insulation at the ends. So I've got to fabricate a replacement for this. I
think I'll try to get two pipes, so I can slide one inside the other and
then extend them into the openings on either end. 

 

Here is a pic of the stamp on the insulation -
