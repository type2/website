Yeah, I haven't found much info on the rear setup. I was thinking of
lowering this bus a couple inches. This 67 seems to sit pretty high!
BUT at the same time, if I fully restore it I will more than likely
keep it stock height. First things first, run, drive, stop. RELIABLY
:-) After that, I'll figure it out. I'm having enough engine problems
right now with the other VWs.

I hear you there! I'm an avid supporter of the 36 hour day. I'm
thinking even that would be to short of a day ;-)
