my nickle and worth every cent you paid for it.

74 may be the easiest of the later buses to get parts etc for. all the 
later campers and I think most buses are walk thru's

no matter what you get a nice side tent would be almost mandatory with 
wife and kid and dog.  even an "overtarp" that forms a covered area 
outside the tent would be easy and usefull for camping.  I made all my own 
poles to fit out of telescoping PVC pipe from home depot, can custom size 
things that way and they are light and easy to handle (child helping)

the idea of gettting one from out west might not be a bad idea but they 
will be more expensive, maybe even Aridzona or souther Texas might work. I 
have seen vehicles sitting outside in El Paso for 40 years restored so the 
weather is kind and there is a big military base, always good for used 
vehicles.  Plan on towing or trailering anything home just to be on the 
safe side til you can break it in and know the vehicle.

sounds like a plan.
have fun and good luck

BTW, Syncros are nice but only I think 1500 campers imported so will be 
very expensive.
