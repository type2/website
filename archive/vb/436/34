Subject: Heater tube insulation

A few years ago I sand blasted the bottom of my bus, and applied some heavy
duty anti-rust stuff (Master Series). I have been pretty happy with it. At
the time, I was not able to get to the middle section of the bus. I kept
putting that off, I am now tackling this section. I won't be able to
sandblast, so just lots of grinding, wire brush work. I am trying to figure
out what to do about the middle tube that carries the heat to the front of
the bus. It still has the original insulation sleeve on it. I am assuming it
is pretty rusty underneath  that sheathing. I'd like to take it off, but I'm
not sure of a good clean way to remove it. Is there a way to remove this
cleanly-or is it not really worth it?
