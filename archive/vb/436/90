The automatic vanagon I had got around 15, maybe 14 mpg!
But it was great to drive in stop and start traffic. It was an improvement.
I just got a call from the guy to whom I sold my vanagon camper, and he 
was ecstatic with it.

BTW the AC never really gets cold air to the front seats but it was 
better than no AC.
