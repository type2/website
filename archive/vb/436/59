Subject: Where is NQ

NQ, Erin Lassley, is alive and well. He is living in Beatrice Ne with 
his new
wife Enid, a great girl from Australia. He is till active in VWs
 . He's made
a few trips over the years to Havasu for BBB but most of 
his VW event work
has been at Bustoberfest. He is quite the McGyver that
 loves to make stuff
most people throw away work again. Proud to call 
him my friend.
Perpetual Lurker
