Subject: 6V heater in 12V bus

Hey guys, cold weather here-and as usual every year I think about getting
the heat going in my bus. 

I have a 6V southwind heater in my bus from when it was 6V. I have since
converted the bus over to 12V. Instead of getting a 12V heater, as my heater
is practically brand new, I thought I could install a voltage drop to bring
the voltage down to 6V. I spoke with a guy who had been recommended on the
list about what would be needed, and if it made sense to try to re-use this
heater in a 12V bus. He said to just put a volt-a-drop in, but to make sure
it was rated for at least 10 AMPs. 

 

I got a voltage drop that is rated up to 15 amps, and was about to
install-but I noticed that the way the thing is wired -it has two hot leads
on it. One is supposed to connect to the regulator, and one to the fuse box.
When I converted my bus  to 12V, I also upgraded to an alternator.

The wire to the fuse block goes to the heater switch, I think this just
controls the relay. 

The one to the voltage regulator goes directly to the relay. I figure the
one to the regulator is the one taking the big draw, and the other one is
minimal. 

 

I was wondering if I could feed 12V to the 6V switch, if it would matter?
Also to be on the safe side I figure I should install an inline fuse. Would
I put it between the alternator and the relay? What amp fuse should I be
using?

 

Thanks for any tips on this.
