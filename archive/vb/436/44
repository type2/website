Hey guys, I was emotionally drained, and forgot to let you all know I am
located in Napa, California.  Its an hour North East of San Francisco, and
hour and half west of Sacramento, if your doing the speed limit.  I can try to
find out the shipping costs for anything, and will set up times for pick-ups
if your close enough.  Thanks again for any consideration.  Aloha.
Sincerely,
Aubrey James Allen
