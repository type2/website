Subject: heat pipe replace

Just thought I'd update you all.I replaced the main heating pipe on my '65.
The pipe that runs from front to back that is covered in that
vinyl/fiberglass protection cover. Unfortunately mine had rusted out on the
ends. So I pulled it out, got some 2.5" exhaust pipe from a  muffler shop,
about 4' long. I was able to slide it in one end than the other. So no real
supports needed. I then sealed the ends with some high temp RTV sealant. Oh
yeah, before that I covered it with some armorflex insulation, unslit. So it
slides over the pipe before installing. 

 

Afterwards I got the original cover back on, I used a combination of zip
ties and metal tape to secure it and seal it. 

 

One other thing - the armorflex is supposed to be painted with latex paint
when used outdoors, so I did that too. Unfortunately the snow fell before I
could really test the system out. If we get a warm spell, and the roads seem
clean, I'll take it for a test drive, and let you all know how well it works
now.
