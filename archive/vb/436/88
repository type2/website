This is Clara's Dad, Sam

We did go camping in the 70 Westy, and even won some kind of trophy at 
Buses by the Bridge IV in Lake Havasu City, AZ.
70 & 71 bay windows are in many ways considered the best. a 71 has disk 
brakes and they both have type 1 engines, easy to get parts.

They have a single cot in the pop up, but can have a kids bed over the 
front seats. These years are sometimes called a 'sun-roof bus' as the 
pop top uses the sun-roof opening. The 73 and later have a double bunk 
in top, but the type IV engine, expensive and complicated to fix.

Late model bays also have built in propane.

I have driven my 63 splitty singlecab many miles, my 70 Westy a lot and 
the vanagon too. There is a major difference in the handling of a 
splitty and  a bay. The bay drives much more like a modern car, if that 
is what your wife wants.

i recommend a 70 westy as I do not trust the first year disk bakes and 
well adjusted drum brakes have never given me a problem.

You can also get a tent that goes on the side of a bay window that makes 
camping with lots of people great.

Well I said a lot, you make your own decision.

Sam
