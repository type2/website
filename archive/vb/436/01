Hi Kevin,
Did you grease the front end of the cable where it is pinned to the arm on the
clutch pedal assembly??  If it rust there due to no lubricant, the solid end
of the cable does not pivot on the arm properly and the clutch cable frays
there.

Did you check that the clutch arm is not wearing its hole into a long slot and
ready to pop through letting loose of the front end of the cable???

Plastic tube for whatever reason is probably a factory tube that just comes on
the clutch cable.
