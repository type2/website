Brakes will break the bank no matter what route to go - the quality parts 
are pretty $$ these days.

That said - I recently made the switch to front disks on my '66 (stock 
height, redux boxes, and 14" wheels).   There are basically 4 choices to 
fit 14" wheels - Wade (-at-) wagenswest's Babystangs, CSP's kit, SACO's kit, 
and Russell (-at-) oldspeed's kit.

There are currently no rear disk options for redux box axles.

I've been running the babystang's since mid october (14th, to be exact) 
and daily driving the bus most of the time since.

Wade uses mildly modified vented mustang 2 disks with integrated hub, and 
wilwood 4 piston calipers + a set of wide 5 adaptors.  Continues to use 
stock lug bolts, and increases track width by ~~1/4" per side (my personal 
measurement - Wade claimed zero change) - ~$1065 shipped

CSP uses solid disk of their own mfr with integrated wide 5 hub, pontiac 
lemans single piston calipers.  decreases track width by ~~8mm per side, 
switches to studs and lug nuts ~$1400 + shipping

saco's kit uses a custom wide 5 hub w/ bolt on solid drilled rotor and 
4 piston wilwood knockoff caliper - there were to many complaints on these 
for me to be interested (and I don't believe a drilled rotor belongs on a 
stock street bus, either).  also converts to stud/nut. 
unknown track change. ~900+shipping

russell (-at-) oldspeed's setup uses vented 944 rotors (turned down to fit a 
14" wheel), 944 front hub (I believe), wide 5 adaptor, and willwood 4 
piston caliper.  russ claims no track change.  also converts to stud/nut. 
~$1500 delivered


I ruled out the saco kit due to the rotors and complaints (and really, if 
you're going to use a wilwood like caliper, why not use the real thing?) 
first.

The CSP kit I eventually ruled out for a few reasons:  No replacement 
rotors available except directly from CSP - and they're not a common off 
the shelf piece.  with 8.5x27" tires, I had -no- wiggle room to reduce 
track width.  I just lightly rubbed the pass side at full left lock under 
power already.  and, if I had a choice I'd prefer a vented rotor.


that left me tossing around Wade vs Russ - both rotors are commonly 
available, but both require minor machine work (which any local machine 
shop could reproduce when needed). both vented, both using (effectively) 
the same caliper and pads (and pads commonly available since wilwood has 
been making aftermarket calipers for a loooong time), and both requiring a 
wide 5 adaptor (from ford 5x4.5 or from porsche 5x130).   Wade's kit let 
me continue using lug bolts....so it won.



For a master cyl I strongly recommend using a stock split bus 67 master 
(22mm bore).  If your reservoir has a larger chamber on one side, use that 
side for the front brakes.  Remove the residual valve for that circuit and 
remove the check valve (easy enough - but it wont go back! :) and 
reinstall.

I don't recommend using any of the disk brake masters - they have a larger 
piston bore, requiring more pedal effort.  unless you're also going to add 
a power brake booster (which is custom fab work), in which case use the 
disk masters!



One of these days I'm going to get a better review together complete with 
pictures....
