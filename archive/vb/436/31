Subject: Re: [VB] disk break question

My crew cab actually had a 73 beam installed like that. They decided to lower
it by pushing the beam up into the frame farther (read: HACK) by notching the
frame. Then they welded in threaded pipes for the mounting bolts.

It holds pretty well, and I can tell you that it has been tested more than its
share. The ride is great with the ball joint beam, and with a vacuum booster,
the brakes are amazing. The front suspension is pretty soft and sitting in it
drops the front, just like a 70s bus.

metals).  '67, mostly for better ground clearance.  Gary
