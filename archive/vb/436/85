Subject: Re: [VB] RE:looking for advice on a new camper

My Aunt and Uncle got a bay dormobile and went on a summer camping trip in
Europe , I think it was the early seventies.   There were five kids, so that
was seven of them.   I think the five kids slept in the bus, and the adults
had a tent.

There are so many choices, so have fun looking.

If your wife does not like driving the split.... why?
  Is she going to like driving a bay?  Or even a vanagon?      Has she test
driven any?    Each split may well drive differently.      Also, there might
be some maintenance to make your split drive better.   ?

My Dad got that vanagon westy becasue he wanted his wife to go camping with
him... and the automatic w/ AC was more modern than his 70 westy.   But you
know what, she just is not really into camping.   She did use it to go to
antique shows though.   Then she got a new minivan, which she can take the
seats out of if need be.   Then the westy just sat, so was sold.
 I did like the built in propane, but it's no big deal to pack a camping stove
and a cooler.

The early bay westys are pretty practical.   Something like this:

has the upright engine you are familar with, pop top, should be a single cot
in the pop top.  fold out bed, dinette table.   Came with childs cot,
originally which might be missing or might be there.   71 had front disc
brakes, which some people like.
