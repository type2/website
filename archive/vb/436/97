Subject: Re: [T2] looking for advice on a new camper

I have seen more photos and gotten a good bit more info on a '78 that looks
like it will fit what we are looking for, and it looks to be in great
condition. Unfortunately it is outside LA and I am in Boston. I'm trying to
figure out the logistics on something like this. 

 

Does anyone on the list live near Claremont, CA, and have time to come check
out a VW for me? I've no idea the proper etiquette for this, or how to
arrange it even, just thought I'd ask. Also - I guess has anyone had another
person look/review a bus for them? How do you recommend going about it?

 

I've seen a lot of pictures, and gotten a lot of answers to my questions on
it-but I am a bit nervous about buying a car without having driven it, or
actually seen it in real life. Anyone done that before?

 

Thanks for any tips/suggestion on this.
