hey folks.  this twist on the thread has me wondering:  if a 28 pci isn't a good choice of carb on a 40hp engine, is a 28 pict carb a poor choice on a 1600sp?

i've got a 1600 engine with a 28 pict carb and while i've noticed no problems, maybe there's something bad happening that i'm missing.  the engine runs strong and nice and i get great gas mileage.  i haven't noticed any starving but i don't expect that i would.
