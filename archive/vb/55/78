FWIW the Old Cars Price Guide says that your '59 Westy has a ballpark
value of $2450 for 'needs complete restoration (may or may not be
running)' down to $800 for a 'parts car'.  According to their
statistics, 1957-1967 VW campers in need of complete resto are all in
the $2300 to $2650 range in value.  Prices come from a compilation of
national/regional data and include collector-car auctions, input from
experts, and verified reports of private sales.  YMMV.  B^)
