>>Uhaul resevation agent said they could not guarantee that the trailer I reserved would be available at that location...<<

So call them back and make the reservation for the trailer.  Then when they ask you for your credit card number to hold the reservation, tell them that you'll give them the credit card number but you can't guarantee that it is a valid account or that you have the credit available to cover the rental fee.  See how fast they will hang up the phone on you!  I'm with the other guys, screw em!!  My Friday opinion!!
