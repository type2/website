Subject: Re: [VB] Oil light flickers on new rebuild.

The way I see it- 20/50 is thicker than 30 w  in hot AND cold weathers.   
It's thinner than 40 wt at least in hot weathers, haven't checked in cool 
weathers. 

I don't see what the split weight means.  I thought 20/50 meant it was 50 in 
hot days and 20 on cold days, but my oil presssure guage disagrees.  It was a 
nice idea.

 Well, when you live in a climate that can go from 86 to 20 in an hour
 (Texass in winter), it saves a lot of oil changes!!
 
 I'm using Valvoline HiRev 20-50 for now, will prolly switch back to a 40wt
 in summer. I saw 10-20 degree cooler temps when I switched to this stuff,
 and the motor seemed a little quieter. Purely subjective, no research or
 anything!  :)
