Subject: RE: [VB] belt broke / ouch hot gen?

by "plastic bits" meaning the brush covers, are you saying that both of the
"slots" have plastic covers? if so remove the bottom one immediately! i
found out the hard way a long time ago (got super hot and melted the grease
out of the bearings and siezed up the generator) about having 2 plastic
covers on. the air gets sucked in through the bottom hole on the generator
and should be vented through the backing plates. the slot on the backing
plate must face downwards when installed in the fanshroud. (i'm assuming
we're talking 12v generator here). yes, there is a proper orientation for
all of it. i don't have a diagram, but could probably supply a pic if
necessary.
