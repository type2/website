Subject: RE: [VB] UHaul Horror Story?

UHaul has THE worst tracking system on the planet.I could probably implement a better system on an old Tandy 100 and smoke signals.

I  reserved an AT and it was not there when promised.Talked to the agent and he told me they don't really have a tracking system that accomadates a true reservation as the equipment may or may not be there when promised,NO SHIT.

So I blazed through all the rental shops in the phone book and found a sweet deal at a trailer builder.Super cheap rate on a top notch unit even had real electric brakes to mate with the controller in my truck and not those sketchy surge units.

Subject: [VB] UHaul Horror Story?


Hi All-

I am planning on picking up a trailer/truck from Uhaul over the weekend to tow a bus I have recently purchased(obligatory bus content). The "reservation"  letter I have before me from UHAUL seems to be not be as much of a reservation as it may first appear.

Call me Chicken Little but I made a few follow up calls to make sure all was in order with the Uhaul agent that I am dealing with to actually pick up the equipment and they tell me that they cannot guarantee that they will have a vehicle/trailer available to me that  I reserved. They tell me that I might need to go to another dealer to get the equipment within a 50 mile radius!  In spekaing with the "customer serviced: 1-800 number if you scratch the caling tones they give you regarding the specifics of your resevervation they will give you the same answer. Hardly a reservation if you ask me- to me reservation and "cannot guarantee and might" should not go in the same sentence.

Right now this is all conjecture as the day of reckoning has yet to arrive (Sunday) however based on this I am not getting that great a feeling about this.

Has anyone else had dealings with UHaul concerning this and how were they (hopefully) resolved?

I want to sort this nonsense out before I get to the UHaul store to find out that they may not have what I reserved.


Thanks

michael
