The ZBed people told me Wednesday that they NO LONGER make bed kits for
busses... "it's a declining market; haven't made one in 5, 6 months." They
can make the pads on a custom-basis, limited fabric choices. They also
don't really sell 'spare parts,' but nothing they have can't be fabbed by a
clever person at a hardware store. (

As for the log... my 70 deluxe has the dual heater tubes under the bench,
and they needed to be mildly tweaked to clear the zbed arms; also, they
cargo mat needs to be cut to allow the arms to lay flat. This was for a
full-width bed.
Slept on it for the first time last weekend, and I can't beleive I let all
the hardware sit around for 4 years before installing it! If you have one
(even tho it means hole drillin') I endorse em!


The 67 Deluxe that Rex bought offa me had a log, and it SEEMED to be far
enough back to clear the arms, but you would still need to trim the mat i'm
guessing.

Hey Rex, the 59 has a zbed, how's it fit? Yours is the partial-width model,
right? Do you have a log  ?  :)
