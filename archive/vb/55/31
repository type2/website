Subject: 30 PICT-1 on 1600's only---NOT!!


.Hi Eric and Barb!

You guys are an amazing resource for us folks on the vintage list!  I wanted
to address a topic that keeps bothering folks trying to run older
carburetors on larger than stock rebuilt engines.

You've suggested that the larger venturied 30 PICT-1 was not used on 1500cc
engines, but on later 1600's.  Check your Bentley and "Without Guesswork"
books and you'll see that from August 1965 (Chass.# 216000001) the 1500cc
44bhp (53 S.A.E.) engine was fitted with a 30 PICT-1 carburetor with a 24mm
venturi.

From the factory this carburetor, as used in a Type II, was fitted with
either a 115 or a 117.5 main jet (sometimes a 120 was installed by the
dealer per a factory notice [see Bentley]), a 135Z air correction, a g60
pilot (idle) jet,  a non -removable 150 pilot jet air bleed, a 50
acceleration injection tube, and a 75 non- removable power jet.

The later 1600 single-port (47 bhp [57 S.A.E.]) engine was fitted with the
same carb with a 120 main, a g55 pilot (idle), and, THIS IS IMPORTANT TO
NOTE, a 50 power jet.

During this era bus carbs can be distinguished from beetle carbs by a little
rivet factory installed on the casted part of the throttle arm stop.  This
was presumably to prevent the upper part of the throttle arm from hitting
the speed governor when wide-open (it also prevented the throttle butterfly
from opening fully!).

Knowing what carb you have to begin with is very important because the
non-removable jets, especially the power jet, are sized for a specific
application.

Case in point: My 1641 single port with a 30 PICT-1 from a '67 Type II will
not get over 18-19 mpg even with a main jet so small that it starves for
fuel at transition speeds!  But note that the stock 1600cc engine in '68-'69
buses came with a much SMALLER power jet, even though the main jet was the
same or larger than factory installed on a '66-'67 30 PICT-1. SOLUTION: Use
the later PICT that had the smaller power jet drilling..Now I get the 22-25
mpg that I am supposed to get with a bus!

I guess the moral of the story is that jetting issues and problems go much
deeper than just changing the removable main, idle, and air correction
jets.The factory installed drillings are important, too!!
