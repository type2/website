Depends. The sticking is inversely proportional to whether you want it stuck
or not. I imagine you could use Super Glue if you wanted them to stay
sealed. They would pop right open. RTV might work, because it doesn't stick
to well to things that don't have 'tooth'. Of course, that being said, you
would probably need a jackhammer to get it off come spring in light of the
above rule. That crud that they've started using to put a paper outer
wrapper on your magazine subscriptions might be good. Holds the cover on
through the mail, then you can peel the cover off without tearing and roll
the glue into a booger you can flick at people.

Cool.
