I found a set of 36 hp p's and c's for  a reasonable price, but they =
come in a plain white box with no name brand on them. only the size on =
the pistons and part number on the box. they are 3 thousand miles away, =
so I can't even look at them first. Any one else had a set like this? =
any ideas where they came from? any one have a set for less than $300?
