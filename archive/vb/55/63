I agree.  My heads don't appear to run any hotter, although I'll admit my 
gauge isn't that precise.  No head problems though in 90,000 straight miles 
of synthetic oil usage.  I don't need a book to tell me it works (or 
doesn't work).  Go to a Nascar race and see how many of them are not using 
synthetic oil.

But it only takes 2.7 quarts!  That's $12 plus a $3 filter (OEM from Bus 
Depot) and you have a $15 oil change every 3,000 miles.  I know some of us 
are price-conscious (I know I am!) but come on.  That's not much money, 
only 1/2 cent per mile!  And some benefits are still realized, like 
resistance to breakdown.

Amen.

No slams to ncbus intended - Chris, you're still my best friend!  Can't
