Subject: Re: [VB] Time to start replacing glass seals

I've found that if you paint the tar on the edge of the glass it'll be =
just enough to seal the laminates AND get tarry goop all over the =
windshield. I use a smallish blade screwdriver to open the seal enough to =
push onto the glass.  Get enough tar on the frame to lubricate the =
flipping lip of the seal. When you push the window in, the seal will touch =
the out facing tar.  A tiny squirt of WD40 on the tight spots will keep =
the rubber from tearing.=20
One person can do the rear window if you're 6'2" and have a prop under the =
opened hatch.=20
One more tip... don't use brake parts cleaner spray to clean up unless you =
want to remove the ink off your rear window stickers. No more ECV on my =
camper!
