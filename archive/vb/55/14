Subject: Re: [VB] Time to start replacing glass seals - Safari

This year I used tar on the body with my OG safari seals and frames. I =
also put 1.5" x 1/4" weatherstripping in the opening before shutting them. =
Still leaks, but doesn't pour. 2 years ago I painted paraffin in the =
openings. That worked pretty well until the warm weather came and it =
melted down the nose.  Last year it didn't rain, so I did nothing. Is =
there a caulk/putty/magic stuff that doesn't stick *too* hard?=20

Do you use the same tar for the safari seal?  My Izzies safaris leak like
they're open when it rains.
