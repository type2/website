Well, that's a bummer. If I don't find one used, I guess I am going to
go crazy with the wood and custom mattresses. My mom is an interior
decorator and uphlosterer, so I can get high density foam in any
thickness wrapped in batting for softness and covered in any material
with piped or rolled edges...I was considering doing this anyway, since
I really don't need the seat as much as I need a big bed back there.
Want to avoid drilling ( I am into stock as much as posisble, but need
somewhere to sleep) , so now I am thinking fancy wood cutting to make a
self supporting bed frame evened up with the rear, and use the stock
mount seat points to hold it down.
We happen to have three greyhounds and a pharoh/shepard mix, camping
pals, so I need a bed of some sort, and a side tent...Missed one on evil
bay couple days back...

The ZBed people told me Wednesday that they NO LONGER make bed kits for
busses... "it's a declining market; haven't made one in 5, 6 months."
They can make the pads on a custom-basis, limited fabric choices. They
also don't really sell 'spare parts,' but nothing they have can't be
fabbed by a clever person at a hardware store. (

As for the log... my 70 deluxe has the dual heater tubes under the
bench, and they needed to be mildly tweaked to clear the zbed arms;
also, they cargo mat needs to be cut to allow the arms to lay flat. This
was for a full-width bed. Slept on it for the first time last weekend,
and I can't beleive I let all the hardware sit around for 4 years before
installing it! If you have one (even tho it means hole drillin') I
endorse em!


The 67 Deluxe that Rex bought offa me had a log, and it SEEMED to be far
enough back to clear the arms, but you would still need to trim the mat
i'm guessing.

Hey Rex, the 59 has a zbed, how's it fit? Yours is the partial-width
model, right? Do you have a log  ?  :)
