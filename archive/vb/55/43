Subject: 64' conversion camper

Thom, I emailed you the other day and have a couple questions maybe you 
could help me with. I aquired a 1964 bus. It has a conversion camper kit 
that has a emblem sticker that says "Caravelle Camper" on the side closet 
door toward the rear of the van. Do you have any information on this 
company? I've been looking and am unable to find anything with this vintage. 
I am trying to restore this split window conversion. The camper portion is 
fine. It has a poptop and flat tilt out side windows. Three on the 
driverside and two on the passenger. The vin# says it was a panel van 
originally. I've checked with ASI and still think it might be a riveria, but 
not a clue. Any help? Thanks...Dennis...
