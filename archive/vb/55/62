Ok, so codes mean different things in different years - 
did they also mean different things in different models?
 "199 - Driver's seat as swivel seat Types 211. 213, 214 
 and Camping Car" would lead me to think so, since my 
model 265 is not specifically listed maybe M199 means 
something different for the 265 that we don't know about.
Thom what is your source?

 Unfortunately no, I have slash bus bumpers. No splash 
pans on the back, Westy bumper on the front (both very 
straight and powder coated white if anyone has a truck 
bumper to trade).
