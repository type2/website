I really don't understand this milage stuff.   I seem to get about 20mph 
around town, and 23 on the freeway.   Less in winter as I let it warm up 
longer.   Get better milage at 2500 rpms than 3000 than 3500.

My first splitty was a 59 with split case tranny I drove it 60mph - probably 
winding the piss out of it.  That bus got 31mph  whether freeway or town, up 
hills, down hills flat,  loaded or empty.  Upright cooler, no thermostat 
though it had that vertical rod between the cylinders I left it there as I 
had no idea what it was, bug muffler, had the little pieces around the intake 
to muffler place, paper filter on top of carb (bad warmup problems in winter) 
with holes cut in the rear bumper ala Muir,  H case motor (1500 or 1600?) 
with low compression in #3, and 28pict carb, the kind that does not have the 
spring between the two halves, has only the spring on cable.   Plenty of 
oomph.  Beginner's luck, I guess.    

Girl I sold it to drove it to Maryland, was going to tell me the address to 
send the new title to, but she never did so I still have title to it.
 
But I have thought of using the 28 pict and seeing if my milage goes up.  
Though I reallly like my 30- pict 1
