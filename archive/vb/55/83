 Ok, so codes mean different things in different years - 
 did they also mean different things in different models?
  "199 - Driver's seat as swivel seat Types 211. 213, 214 
  and Camping Car" would lead me to think so, since my 
 model 265 is not specifically listed maybe M199 means 
 something different for the 265 that we don't know about.
 Thom what is your source?

I don't think they meant different things for different models, however, some 
m codes are limited to which models they are on.  like the sliding door m 
code- dif codes for panel van, kombi, standard, not available on trucks, same 
code is used for something else on pre 63 buses.    Think about it- the door 
for the standard is different than the door for the panel, so dif code.

Didn't VW do  the same thing with the port codes- code meant dif things in 
dif years.
