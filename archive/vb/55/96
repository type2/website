Subject: RE: [VB] 71 brake master cylinder

"When I mounted the new 71 24mm master cylinder the two original lines were
pointed right at the ports on the master cylinder, even with the adapter
plate, just like down town!"

So did you use an adaptor plate and if so which one?

I could not figure out from the post if you did or did not :)

I think Bus Boys makes the adapter kit.
