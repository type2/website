The synthetic oil "truth" is based on testing when? 197x? I assure you, oils
have made huge changes since then. OUR testing has shown 10-15 degree drops
in oil temps, with other engine temps staying the same or dropping, PROVIDED
you use one of a couple brands of oil.

The benefits of synthetics are not utilized if you don't have good
filtration, since to remove the dirt you have to change the oil ($$$$).

I really wish people would take a good HARD look at tests, and when they
were done, when repeating that "information" to everyone within earshot.
Otherwise we'll all be driving with Bias Ply tires, straight weight oil, and
AM radios. Time marches on (and so does technology), don't get stuck in a
rut!

PS: There is some EXTENSIVE dyno testing taking place on certain cylinder
head chamber shapes, and deck heights, and compression ratios, on the
upright Type 1 engine, including oil and head temps, and output #s, that
will try to rid the VW World of a humongous Myth that's been circulating for
what seems like forever. Stay tuned. My lips are sealed, but you heard it
here first.
