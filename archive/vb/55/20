I don't think Liquid Nails would be a wise choice for this application.  It
would probably tear the rubber and be a pain in the a$$ to get off the
frames once you wanted to open the safaris.  A better choice would be to get
a roll of vinyl mastic and massage it around the frame/rubber interface when
the window is closed.  Place the seam at the top.

I don't have safari windows so I haven't tried this, but the "a
caulk/putty/magic stuff that doesn't stick *too* hard" you seek sounds
like one of the many formulations of "Liquid Nails", a caulk-like
adhesive readily found at Home Despots and such stores.
