Hi Andy:
Generators do depend on air from the shroud for cooling.  If the wrong
tinware is used it is possible, I suppose, to not get sufficient flow for
cooling.  I'm not sure without looking at a generator, but I  _think_  that
the brush covers are supposed to be there to keep dookie outta the brush
assembly.  Therefore the flow exits the rear of the generator around the
pulley.  Hmmm - a pulley with vanes to help draw the air through - Honey can
I buy a milling machine?
