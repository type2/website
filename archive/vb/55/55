I thought 361 was a US spec code.   I have never found it on any list, just 
on lots of US spec buses of about your year.

one thing to keep in mind is that sometimes the same code meant different 
things in different years.

Interesting that 175 is used for us bumpers for non trucks, and 176 for 
trucks.  later US spec code packages include the bumper,  your code package 
doe not include us bumper, so you get extra us bumper code.

Do you have the special 59-60 truck rear bumper?
