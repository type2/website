The way the ratings work is that the oil viscosity is measured at two
different temperatures.  If the rating is taken at the higher temperature,
the rating is the "straight grade" weight.  If the rating is taken at the
lower temperature, the rating is appeneded with a W.  The "W" stands for
"winter", not "weight"  The straight rating number and the "W" rating
number have nothing to do with each other and cannot be compared.  That
is why you can buy 20W20 oil.  This is an oil that has a rating of 20 at
high temperatures and a rating of 20W at lower temperatures.

A 20W50 oil will have higher viscosity than a 40 oil at operating
temperature.  At low temperature, we can't compare them, since the
"straight 40" oil has no low temperature "W" rating.
