Tar will stain fresh paint, if you leave it on.  Old paint it does not stain. 
  I know this from swapping the safari window in and out of my 61 (when it 
has the stationary windsheild, it gets the roofing tar)  Also when I took my 
65 apart to paint it there was no stain from where I had tarred it 3? years 
before.   Reinstalled the windsheilds in the 65 a few days- maybe 5 after 
painting the white, cleaned off the tar, no stains that I have seen.   But I 
have seen stains on paint where the area had been rattled canned, then really 
soon (a day or less)windows installed, and the tar not cleaned up for weeks.

 Does tar effect the paint at all?
