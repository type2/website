 Hi Jdd,
 The 28PCI with it's 21.5 venturi would be way too small for a 40HP 
 1200-1400cc engine.  Best to work with the 28PICT or a 28PICT-1 carb with 
 thier 22.5 venturi for it.  Eric&Barb

I wouldn't think a 28 pci (36hp carb) would fit a later intake.   I think an 
intake that fits a 28 PICT won't take the 28 pci, like the DP carbs don't fit 
the SP intake.

You can tell by the shape of the intake what size motor you have (well, 
approximately)   And if the gen stand is cast into the engine case its 36 (or 
25) hp, if not it is larger.
