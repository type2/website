Hi Rachel,
It is not a great choice for a 1600cc, but can be used if jetted properly.  
If jetted for a 1500 and not the 1600 it will run too rich, especially in 
higher RPMs.  Robbing the engine of HP, and possibly washing the cylinder 
rings of thier oil and wearing them and the cylinders out due to this.  The 
28PICT & 28 PICT-1 have 22.5 dia. venturis.  The 1600 used a 24mm dia venturi 
in the 30 PICT-1 and 30 PICT-2 carbs.  So even if the 28 PICT is jetted 
properly one will not get the upper RPM HP that the 1600 should get.   So if 
given a choice we would just get a 30 PICT-1 or a 30 PICT-2 instead.
