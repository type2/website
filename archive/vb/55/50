well no... i dont have a digital camera. my shirts are actually transfers. i 
have found, after many tries, transfers that wear extremely well. they come 
out pretty much exactly as you see em on the screen. i have sold to many a 
list member, maybe someone can speek up and vouch for their beauty.

thanks,
