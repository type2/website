The Canadian Solution......

Fact - Original safari's and seals leak........ use duct tape to keep the
rain out and then peel off when the sun comes out. Get a few extra mpg, mph,
and the NASCAR look all in one shot. I believe this was featured on the "Red
Green" show last year!


Okay, all joking aside...... it does work as a temporary solution in a
downpour.
