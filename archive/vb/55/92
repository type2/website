Subject: Are these camper brochure pix online?

Ran across these two pix on eb*y.

I've seen some of these shots, but does anyone know if scans of the whole book (or more of the pix, especially the tent ones) are 
online?  Looks like Brekina reprinted an original westy brochure for the model set in the background.
