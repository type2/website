Well, when you live in a climate that can go from 86 to 20 in an hour
(Texass in winter), it saves a lot of oil changes!!

I'm using Valvoline HiRev 20-50 for now, will prolly switch back to a 40wt
in summer. I saw 10-20 degree cooler temps when I switched to this stuff,
and the motor seemed a little quieter. Purely subjective, no research or
anything!  :)
