Subject: Red interior

Anyone out there know where to find the rubber that goes under the front
seat in Red? Are the repro's dye-able? Along the same lines how about a
Red Coco mat, or the material to make one?

I also need Euro front bumper trim (the long ones) *any* misc. pieces of
Deluxe trim (I don't mind cutting down the long ones if need be.

Thanks in advance,
Greg
