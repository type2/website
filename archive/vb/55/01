Hi Rich,
Once one can see the rust it is the tip of the iceberg!

Yup!  On our 1960 panel camper conversion we had to reconstruct the lower 
corners and much of the bottoms of the window frames.  Lace is nice, but not 
in sheet metal!

We apply a very thin bead of tar inside the groove the glass seats inside of 
before installing the glass/rubber into the frame.  Trying to apply the tar 
after glass/rubber installation makes it very hard to do the top section of 
the seal properly due to gravity and the non-BD fresh air overhang.  Plus the 
seal is under pressure inside the frame which makes it hard to get the tar in 
there even more.  Better to have a bit of a tar mess to clean up now, that 
more rust later!
