Subject: UHaul Horror Story?

Hi All-

I am planning on picking up a trailer/truck from Uhaul over the weekend to =
tow a bus I have recently purchased(obligatory bus content). The "reservati=
on"  letter I have before me from UHAUL seems to be not be as much of a =
reservation as it may first appear.

Call me Chicken Little but I made a few follow up calls to make sure all =
was in order with the Uhaul agent that I am dealing with to actually pick =
up the equipment and they tell me that they cannot guarantee that they =
will have a vehicle/trailer available to me that  I reserved. They tell me =
that I might need to go to another dealer to get the equipment within a 50 =
mile radius!  In spekaing with the "customer serviced: 1-800 number if you =
scratch the caling tones they give you regarding the specifics of your =
resevervation they will give you the same answer. Hardly a reservation if =
you ask me- to me reservation and "cannot guarantee and might" should not =
go in the same sentence.

Right now this is all conjecture as the day of reckoning has yet to arrive =
(Sunday) however based on this I am not getting that great a feeling about =
this.

Has anyone else had dealings with UHaul concerning this and how were they =
(hopefully) resolved?

I want to sort this nonsense out before I get to the UHaul store to find =
out that they may not have what I reserved.


Thanks

michael
