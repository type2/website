Subject: Bus wanted , Old one dead

Ok,
 I need to get a bus.
I am located in Charlotte NC , I will drive a day one way to get one .  Any
bus any year , It must drive  although a motor is not important as i can
bring a 1600 i have to put in it(assuming it will fit). I wanted a truck but
i will settle for a bus,  looking for one in the $2000 area.
 Thanks
, Bryan
