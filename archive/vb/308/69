Why not get a cap for a 009 and cut a notch in it???  I believe it'll work...
Hi Clara,
That should do it!  We found that a distributor used on Rabbit (had one 
vaccume packed in our parts stash) will fit 010 (OG 009, 019, and several others 
used the same cap as the 010) distributors with a small amount of filing a round 
notch into the edge of of this cap.
