[queue mama's and papa's greatest hit, "california dreamin'... on such a 
winter's day...."]

we made the trip up and down hwy 1 in CA more than several times in our westy 
in the past few years, more recently camping up and down the coastline in our 
westy we called home at the time, just about a year ago. you're right about 
the exquisite drive throughout the whole state, except central CA where it 
turned inland and up north where the lost coast prevents access. the industrial 
areas around Long Beach actually helps bring it all into perspective. other than 
that, there are just too many places to give props to.

it'd be great to read others' experiences from oregon and washington. 

looking forward to breath the salt air briefly again, when BYOB rolls around 
(bus content.)
