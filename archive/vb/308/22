For reference, the Interstate 2-XHD I have cost me $65 in September 2002.

Good point.  The Interstate warehouse is about five miles from my house
and about 0.1 mile from where I work, so getting one of those is easy
for me.

The Optimas I've run have an 800 number on the top.  Presumably they
direct you to some local shop, but not everyone stocks the 6 V model.

You might try AutoZone corporate as well.  Check their Web site.

Ah, you had the Group 19L one that they sell for Bugs.  The one I run
is a Group 2 and weighs about half again as much as yours.  Suggestion:
if you get it exchanged, trade it to somebody who has a Bug and keep
running the bigger battery in your Bus.

On my '64, the outboard end of the strap is bolted to the floor and the
stud is long enough to give you some adjustment there.  If you just need
6 mm or so, this might be the way to go.

It's possible.  I think it would be most likely to damage the regulator,
then the generator.  I have done this once or twice as well.  I try to
really limit the amount of time that the 12 V battery is connected to
the Bus.  I have noted that the generator light will stay on brightly
with the engine running while the 12 V battery is hooked up.  I haven't
noticed any long-term damage, but again, I've only done this about twice.
