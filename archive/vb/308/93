Subject: Re: [VB] Gas Tank Problem/ my broken clutch

You can put a reserve tap on a 62-67 tank, and surely on the early bay ones 
too if you want th 15gallon option.  Ignore the sender thing, I mean you need a 
sender to fill the hole but you don't have to use it.   I saw a 62-67 tank on 
thesamba for $10 recently.   Where are you located?   I have some spare gas 
tanks both w/ sender hole and not.  

One REALLY nice thing about the reserve tap is when you pull the motor you 
can turn it to off, and voila, no gas dripping issues.   The motor is out of my 
61, and that was joy, I tell you, joy.   And I pulled the old fuel line off to 
put new on  as it's easy to get to, and no gas drips out w/ the tap off.   
It's the og tap that came with the bus,  I rebuildt it w/ a WW kit that comes w/ 
instructions for a bug tap which is slightly different but no big deal.

Yup, the TO arm was broken at the tip where one of the clips goes.   New arm 
in, took TO bearing pieces off and regreased and reassembled it.. it's the old 
kind you can do that with.. now TO bearing back on w/ new clips that are real 
fun to install.    Going to replace the fuel line and a few bits, maybe top 
gear oil,  while the motor is out.   Awesome sunny weather today, might hit 60.

I would not be opposed to putting a stock tank back in with the reserve hooked
up. Anybody have one in good shape?
