We drive the heck(Utahese for hell) out of them, but not much in the winter
when they salt the roads! I use the Vanagon for winter use! I did take the
DC to the dump last week to get rid of some tree branches that broke off
after Xmas in a huge snow storm-it took a month for it to warm up enuf to
get at the stuff & to want to pull the DC out.
