Subject: spare cooling flaps/linkage?

Does anyone out there know of  a source for control flaps and their linkage? 
I need a set for a '71 doghouse model fan housing.
I've checked the usual suspects, but there aren't any re-pro's available, unless any of you know otherwise.
I'd really appreciate any help.

Thanks,
Rocco
