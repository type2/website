Subject: Re: [VB] 1500 tunnel tranny in my split case '57 bus

you can buy or make an adaptor to bolt a tunnel case tranny in your split 
case bus.   I've seen a copuple home made ones, which are basically thick steel 
plate with 4 holes drilled in-  2 for the bus, and 2 for the tranny.  It's been 
a while and I can give you no dimensions.  Also seen it threee pieces, one in 
the middle, and one hinged each side on two bolts. 
  I didn't use the rubber mount.  It wouldn't fit.

the RGBoxes with big nuts (46mm) tend to be 1.26, those with small nuts 
(36mm) tend to be 1.39.    You can undo the fill plug, mark a tooth, and turn the 
axle to count the teeth. 

 16 teeeth on the gear at the end of the shaft  (upper gear) goes with a 1.68 
ratio, or early mountain gears
18 teeth on the upper gear goes wirth 25 on the shaft for a 1.39 ratio
19 teeth on the upper gear goes with 24 on the stub axle, a 1.26 ratio

for the middle section, the r&p ratio are  (pinion shaft : ring gear) 
7:31 or 4.43  for split case 

8:35 (4.375) or
8:33 (4.12) for stock options for splitty (and swing axle bug) tunnel cases, 
or 
8:31 (3.875) for the late IRS bug r&p which required modification to use in a 
splitty friendly tunnel case section. 

There is some way of turning the input spline and holding one axle still and 
counting the turn ratio of the other axle turning to # turns of the center 
spline, but I never did it.   I have pulled a side cover and counted teeth on the 
ring gear though.  :)

Personally I find my 61 with 1.26 rgbs and 4.375 r/p and 15" rims w/ 205 75 
15 tires fine.  I comfortably drive 58 (slower than most traffic, but not too 
slow) at 3K rpms engine speed with a 1600 have enough oomph to manuever , it 
can pull hills laden.  I can take it up to 70 if I feel like it.   the r/p ratio 
of the split case is not much different, you might just put 1.26 boxes on the 
splitcase tranny.



just swapping the 1.39 rgboxes to 1.26 will make you go 55.1 instead of 50mph 
at the same engine speed.   

Swapping to 1.26 boxes and a 4.38 r/p turns your 50mph to 55.9 mph. 

keeping the same little nut boxes and swapping to a 4.12 r/p gets you 53.7 
mph instead of 50.

swapping to a 4.125r/p and 1.26 boxes gets you 59mph instead of 50

I though all 1500 buses came 1 ton.   ????   i don't understand the t1 thing 
you mentioned...  well, whatever. bugs came with .89 4th gears, but you 
probably want the higher .82 bus/ghia 4th gear.

early nose cones dont fit tunnel case trannies.  Really.  

but the bus tunnel nose cone on the tunnel trans will put the shift stick in 
the right place in your split case bus.

With lots of advice (thanks guys and gals) and calulations I've come to 
realise that basically the simplest way to upgrade my stock '57 1200 
split case tranny is to fit a 1500 setup (not 1-ton) from a '64-'67 (was 
thinking t1 gt box + r.boxes, but it's just not worth the hassle for a 
4mph increase over stock 1500 split setup!)  - remember I want to retain 
stock ride height.

So I guess I need an adaptor to either:

bolt the later tranny to the early torsion bar mount point (preferable - 
but is this possible ????? would the shift rod line up etc., does a 
later mount just bolt straight on anyway? - it kind of looks like the 
mount bolts are actually in the same position anyway in the factory 
workshop manual.

OR

bolt the early nose cone to the later tranny with a suitable adaptor 
plate - does anyone make these or does anyone have a pattern as I have a 
nice plasma cutter : ).
