Subject: Re: [VB] RE: 6V battery questions

I use the same battery in bug & bus,   and I buy the cheaper one from sears.  
 The sales guy trys to sell me a pricier ones but I buy the 40 buck version, 
and it lasts about 6-7 years.  I recently bought my 3rd battery for Bugster .. 
1st was  in Jan 91.    

FWIW, it only gets below 25* F here rarely.  

I plan to get 63 sc truck going by summer, and I have this interesting crank 
apron with one tailpipe with the factory cut out... like for a 40hp not a 
36hp!!!!  anyway, truck'll have the crank set up as well as electric starter.   
I'll have to modify some rear 1600 engine tin for the crank hole.

My advice was based on the idea that Bugs have to run a not-very-tall
battery, but that it's easier to fit a bigger-than-stock battery to a
Bus.  The same battery should start either engine, but the extra
capacity might save you a walk someday.

Maybe the right solution is just to get a crank-start apron, rear tin
piece, pulley nut, and handle.  :)
