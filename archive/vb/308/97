Unless they have been drilled and oversized, all 373 heads were 8mm on
the exhaust and intake valve guides. I have some leftover Formulae Vee
heads that are 9mm, but they also have 39.5 X 35 stainless steel sodium
filled valves in them too!

What's the stock valve stem size for a 311 101 373A SP head?

8mm?

Bus Depot lists the 32mm exhaust valve as coming in two different guide
sizes (8mm and 9mm) and I'm trying to figure out which I have...

thanks,
