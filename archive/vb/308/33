Kevin I carry new rebuild parts for the SouthWinds at:

http://pages.prodigy.net/busbarn/southwind.html

I also have NOS factory service manuals for $20 plus shipping along with new
12V control relays and flexable exhaust.  I do have some used parts and will
have more shortly, just drop me an email.

Thanks,
