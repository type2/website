You can use the flap assemblies out of any 67-71 T1/T2, and 72-74 T1.
The only two things you have to change is the flap control bar in front
of the shroud and make sure your flap rod is bent properly and free to
move up and down through the head. I use 1500 SP and 1600 DP flaps
interchangeably and it is usually what you have to do when scrounging up
spare parts.

Does anyone out there know of  a source for control flaps and their
linkage?
I need a set for a '71 doghouse model fan housing.
I've checked the usual suspects, but there aren't any re-pro's
available, unless any of you know otherwise. I'd really appreciate any
help.

Thanks,
