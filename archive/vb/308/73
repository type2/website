I take what you wrote to be in order you did them

fill center
drain RGBs
fill RGBs.

Now Visualise the transmission as a Habitrail, and the gear oil as hamsters

the hamsters can run from RGB to center section to RGB anmd back through the 
axle tubes.   If you pull the plugs in the RGBs you also drain some hamsters 
from the center section.  Depending on how long you let it drain, the level 
could hav gone down a bit.  So it should be filled AFTER everything is drained 
and the drain plugs back in.  

Check and fill the center section.  If it was low, wait a bit ( the hamsters 
are pretty slow, especially this time of year, can take a while for them to 
level out.)  After at least ten mins, Go back and check the level again and top 
as needed.

I topped off the tranny last night (part of preparations for Shasta Trip),
and drained RGBs, then refilled them.

Today when I took this 60 DC with an early 67 drive train for a test drive,
I noticed more gear "growl" than usual...it may be that I was up all night
working on the thing, and was being hypersensitive...
