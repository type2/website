<snip spam rant - with which I heartily concur>

Though I drive my '65 neunsitzer daily, my VW fetish waxes and wanes 
depending on time and mood.  I really like the "push" nature of the 
mailing list -- sometimes I barely have time to scan the headers in the 
digest but it's a great tickler to keep me in contact with the VB 
community.  I think if I had to actively go to a forum I'd go much 
longer without participating.  Besides, the nostalgia value is also a 
factor -- I'll never forget how excited I was to stumble across my 
peeps on vanagon(-at-)lenti years ago.

Sometimes I wish there was more traffic here, and sometimes I'm glad 
there isn't.

I'm lucky that my ISP has an aggressive spam-filtering system (it's 
worth the occasional missed message) and that the Mac Mail client has a 
pretty smart junkmail filter - spam's nowhere near the problem for me 
that it used to be.  I can't imagine what it must be like for people 
without some kind of gatekeeper.

For now, no fora for me.  BTDT with newsgroups - it was fun for a 
while, but not the same.  Moderators and admins, your work is highly 
appreciated!!!
