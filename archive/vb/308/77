Subject: Re: [VB] tie rods

Tie rods just eventually wear out.   The early kind have grease fittings, but 
but 65 they no longer did.  Dunno that they sell just ends, but keep and good 
ends you have.    Replace one or both rods?   up to you.  

Never hurts to inspect the suspension for wear, a good idea.   Give 
everything a good greasing while you're at it.  grease is good.   your bus loves 
grease.  grease it  till clean grease comes out.     how is the sgbox adjustement?

So I guess the basic questions:
Should I look for some other thing wrong with the front end to cause the
wear here?
Should I just replace the ends, or the whole thing?
Which type should I get (both adjustable or just the driver side)?
Which manufacturer/source do you recommend?
