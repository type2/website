Subject: Bus on Futurama

I just checked my Tivo, and the episode with the bus
is recorded.  If anyone might like a dub to VHS tape,
I could do it pretty easily. Please pmail.  The bus is
a cross between a bay and a split, and leaves a
horrible oil smoke screen behind it, but it's gotta be
a (bus) collector's item.
