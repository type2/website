Subject: Re: [VB] 64 shift coupler problems

well, something ain't right in your brothers bus.  
I'd double check everything at the mounts front and rear.

driving with the shift linkage like that not only makes it hard to shift but 
I'd bet a donut that it'll help wear things out in the tranny.    

I had found a later shift coupler installed  in a 59 sc I had, that had no 
reverse gear (couldn't find it at all).  A hole had been drilled through the 
long shift rod to accept the bay coupler.   On general principles I tossed the 
late one and installed a splitty one.  Lo and behold, reverse was 
there!!!!!!!!!!

Hi All!

We have a problem on my brother's 64.  It seems the new transmission is
angled such that the hose cone and is tilted slightly upward.  This makes
for a bear of a time connecting the shift coupler.  It also makes shifting a
real bear.  Is it possible to shim between the rear trans carrier and the
mounts to correct this?  Or are we missing something obvious?

Or, as a last resort, does the late bus coupler fit the early busses?  That
design seems a little more forgiving of misalignment..
