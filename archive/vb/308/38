Hi Josh,

you scrawled:
Hey folks,   i was testing out my headlights...

  Did you forget to tell us that you moved the brown and gray wire on the
bucket?  Cause something like that *will* happened where you put ground
directly on one of the few un-fused circuits on the xporter.  I tried to
tell people this on one of my posts in the past.  Maybe someone on the
list has a spare front headlight loom to give you?  I know you are nearly
done, and really this is a minor set-back.

Best,
joe
