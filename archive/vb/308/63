Subject: faux flip top westy

	Is there anyone out there has made a standard bus into a flip top westy?
Anyone heard of this? Would it be hard to do and make it look fairly correct?     Im also open to peoples thoughts on how this is just another cutting up of buses etc. I would be doing it on a ratty 64 standard just FYI for those who might fear I would cut up an original or early bus.
																																								Thanks
