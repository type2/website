VintageBus has, I think, always had fewer subscribers than Type2.  At
this moment, there are 433 unique email addresses subscribed to VB and
900 unique email addresses subscribed to T2.

Mail to both lists slows down a little around the end of December and
the first of January as people go out of town and away from their email
for the holidays.

I do think that some people are moving over to the forums at
thesamba.com .  The type2.com admins have discussed adding Web forums
for Type2 and VintageBus, but we haven't done it so far.  It isn't
clear if the bandwidth usage (and hence type2.com's bill from our
ISP) for Web forums instead of mailing lists would go up, down, or
stay the same.

Also, since the first of the year, the "You Can Spam" act, purchased
from the US Congress by the Direct Marketing Assocation, has been in
effect.  It legalizes spamming in the US.  As you can see at
http://fbm.brightmail.com/spamstats.html and
http://www.tesp.com/tespUBERate.htm , it is working as designed,
allowing ever more spam to be sent.  IMHO, more and more people are
abandoning email as a useful form of communication.

If you want to ask about spam, mail me offlist.  Most of the obvious
answers to the spam problem won't work.
