Bertrand,

If it is positively from a '74, then yes, modifications need to be done to make it fit.  The split bus poles have different lengths, along with the hammock canvas.

Unless they are the late bay (76-79) collapsible poles, then at least one of them will have to be cut down several inches then welded back together.  The canvas will also have to be trimmed to fit properly.

I used early bay poles, cut the front one down, and welded it back together with a steel sleeve over the cut for extra support.  Picked up a new repro canavs from dawn at PLF and it has been awesome.  My 4 yr old sleeps in it quite a bit.

Go here for the needed measurements.
