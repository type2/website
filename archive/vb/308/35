Subject: 64-67 bus gearbox info

guys-

what, if any difference(s) is there between the 64-67 gearboxs, and RGBs? assuming the units in question are standard units, and not an alpine box, etc.

in other words is any on of these interchangeable  within that range? and is there a way to tell ratios, gearbox type from the serial number, or other numbers on gearbox?

thanks in advance troops
robert
