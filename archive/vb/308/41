Subject: Re: [SPAM]  [VB] Gas Tank Problem

Sounds like a bay window gas tank. On them the cap is sealed and in the
center on top of the tank is the vent line for the tank. On splitty tanks,
the cap is the vent.

What I did (I have a bay tank in my bus) is run a piece of line from the
vent at the tank, and put the other end up by the filler (held up with a zip
tie) with a fuel filter on the end to keep the tank clean, and also prevent
fuel from sloshing out when making hard turns or while driving on bumpy
roads. Works great. I can top my tank off all the way up to the cap, and
drive however I want with no fuel smells at all.
