Subject: Re: [VB] faux flip top westy

i had a flip top roof section for sale last year and must have had a dozen people in 
2 days want to buy it.  so i am sure folks are doing it!  at least it would be age 
appropriate on a 64 usually one of the last years although there are later ones also 
not just common.
