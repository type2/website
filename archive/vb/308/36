Space constraints, plus like Harry said, the Bug battery is a little
more protected from the elements.  The Bus also has a slightly longer
positive cable, I think.  The "Without Guesswork" says that the Bus
battery always had 15%-25% more capacity than the Bug or Type 3 battery.

My advice was based on the idea that Bugs have to run a not-very-tall
battery, but that it's easier to fit a bigger-than-stock battery to a
Bus.  The same battery should start either engine, but the extra
capacity might save you a walk someday.

Maybe the right solution is just to get a crank-start apron, rear tin
piece, pulley nut, and handle.  :)
