"Back in the late 60's and early 70's I used to hitch hike from 
Newport
Beach, Cal to Gold Hill Oregon on a monthly basis. I always went Hwy. 1. 
Back
in the day"

1968...I made my pilgrimage from "So Cal" to Oregon, drove my 54 chevy
sedan delivery, gave a lift to a "couple of long hair hippies" out of
Oxnard, plenty of (smoke) & good-humored acquaintance, "could have been
you ronnie"

They were going to the "Haight"

No sooner dropped them off, than yep, another.....long hair... hitched with
me on north, my destination was Portland, he asked if I would take the
scenic route thru "Fort Brag". Having not ever been farther North than
Topanga, this was a terrific trip.

As any one knows, who has traveled hiway 1 north on the Cal & Oregon
coast it's a spiritual experience. Which ever route you choose. Take the time
to drink in all that's offered.
