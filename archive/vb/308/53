Why not get a cap for a 009 and cut a notch in it???  I believe it'll work...

Be glad you aren't running the older 25hp distributor.    I broke a rotor on 
the way to Seattle in the 53 a few years ago.   pulled over on the freeway.   
For some reason there was a spare dist in the following bus, but not spare 
plug wires... and the plug wires on the 25hp dist (383? I forget the #) are 
screwed into the 2 part flat top cap, not push ons, so using a later dist was not 
an option.    Electrical taped the rotor back together, which got me to 
Seattle...  A very kind friend brought me a spare new rotor the next day from his 
stash for his old split window bugs.

Back on my bus. Man! Tune up parts for an old distributor are getting 
expensive. It probably cost me $35 for a cap, rotor, points, condensor for this 019 
that dates to the very earliest bugs/buses.
