Subject: RE: [VB] I am with Ellis! Got water?

Darn now I have to exaplin myself...

The '66 is fine.  I drive the piss out of it normally.  How many people do 
you know that take thier bus on 12 hour plus cruises a few times a year in 
addition to daily driving and multiple other medium distance camping trips?

Right now the '66 is getting a 944 rear end IRS conversion so yah it will 
take another week before she sees the road again.

Again the '66 is a Westi so it cannot be used as a work truck for my needs 
without killing it inside.

Basically the Eurovan is a disposable vehicle.  It will see paint cans, 
tools, ladders and other not so nice things as daily life.  Not to mention 
daily commutes to who knows where.  I do not want to literally kill it, but 
it will be used up by the time I am done with it.

Lets talk money.  I paid $4500 for the EV and it is very well off 
mechanically and I need to do very little in the future to it.  Could I get 
a decent panel van for $4500 with good paint and something customers would 
not mind parked in front of thier houses?  I doubt it.  Now lets update the 
brakes a bit, mmm $2Kish there.  Probably want a good stout motor, $3Kish.  
A split for a real work truck does not make any sence to me unless you found 
one almost free that was in great shape.

Now if I ran a piss poor business and was selling price maybe people would 
not mind a burned out roach mobile in thier front yard, but for what I 
charge (and deliver) they expect something plain and non-controversial in 
thier yards.  And the happier they are the more references I get which keeps 
everyone happy.  (I know social injustice as early bus profiling - get over 
it as it is reality)

I have owned more than a few air cooler busses in my time... Time to try a 
water pumper.


Take Care,
Adrian Pillow
