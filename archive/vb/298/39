Subject: Re: [VB] exaust without heat exchangers?

well,  a head fits to 2 cylinders, and each cylinder exhausts in opposite 
direction, meaning you have exhaust out the front and back of the heads (as seen 
when they are installed in the bus).  to the back it goes into the muffler, to 
the front into the heater boxes, which curve round to the back to the muffler.

You can also use J tubes, which do not allow you to have heat in the bus.   
Without the heater boxes, you must block off the fresh air outlet from the 
fan shroud, or the engine will run hot.

Where do you live?   Post your location to the list as many VW folks have 
extra heater boxes in their garages they'd be happy to let you have, definately 
cheaper than new ones.   

 Also available at swap meets, though there aren't many this time of year.

please don't cut holes in your apron or muffler to fit a beetle exhaust

  i was wondering if it was possible to drive my bus around without the 
heater boxes ( heat exchangers?) and still have an exaust system hooked up. so 
could i? i really dont have the money to buy new ones, and i would only be driving 
it around till i got a job and could buy new ones. ( im only 16 ). thanks in  
advance,                                             
p.s.       my engine is a 1500cc. i plan to put a beetle exaust system on.
