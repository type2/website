Subject: heat exchangers vs J tubes

Hi All -

 From Eric&Barb:
.... The stock ones since early 1964 models not only have fins on the 
outside of the tubes inside the skins of the exchangers, but also 
inside.  These inner ones can just be seen when looking up the rear ends of 
the exchangers with a flashlight. ....

 From Me:
On this subject, the inner fins (looks sort of accordion like in there on 
both sides) definitely interfere with the even flow of exhaust gases coming 
out the rear ports.  Likely does not matter with a stock/near stock motor, 
but if your's is modified by way of size, carburetion, head flow, etc., and 
let's say you put on an extractor exhaust - then the rear ports are to my 
mind clogged compared to the front ports emptying into a nice big round pipe.

My take is that this means a definite heat build up at the rear ports.

The three approaches I know of so far are to fabricate your own, using a 
stock exchanger shell with (parts of) the fins brazed onto a J tube, go 
without heat, or pay the big bucks and fall for a custom made one such as 
Kymco and others sell.

We did the fab routine on my '71 bus motor, which lasted through three 
rebuilds and 185,000 miles.  This included welding on flanges to the ends 
of the J tubes as well as matching flanges on the rear carrier for a three 
way very sturdy sandwich.   On the not-yet-fired-up new motor, while 
cleaning them up, I noticed that the brazing had given way and the fins are 
rattling around in the casing.  But, getting impatient I'm installing them 
anyway.

Nick
