Agreed. Also, there's no way to do body work on a panel that has spray on
foam adhered to it. It'd have to be burned and scraped off, and though it
may seem expedient at the time, wait til you have to do bodywork on the
door or panel, then the headaches will start. Use POR on the inside
surfaces, then bag some insulation as suggested here, or what I've done
successfully, is to POR the inside surfaces, then stuff standard fiberglas
insulation in there. The trapped moisture has never gone thru the POR, and
it's always wet in there during the rainy season anyway. The other eight
months of the year - dry as a bone.

Apply the POR to clean, dry, non-greasy inside surfaces - leave any
factory paint ON if it's in good condition. Otherwise, prep using the
usual good bodywork practices, then apply POR. Should last a long time.
