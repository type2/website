Subject: Re: [VB] exaust without heat exchangers?

oops I meant BUMPER not muffler, for some reason I mixed the words up... 
sorry....

you can often find headers at swaps cheap.  at a swap in the fall i bought a 
good bus muffler for $5 and from another guy the dampner pipe and pigtail 
clamped together for $5.  So a complete bus muffler less bracket (new about $5 to 
$7, but I have an extra... they don't wear out) for $10.

oh, expect a post about how bug mufflers on buses send the exhaust in the 
wrong air flow so it can seep inside the bus
....
