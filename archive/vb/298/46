Subject: Re: [VB] stuck drums...

For really stuck drums, my local ACVW workshop has the
ultimate VW hub puller, made of scrap.

It consists of two scrap wide-five rims, parallel to each
other and about 45cm (18in) apart, and joined together by a
sort of cage of four steel strips welded between each rim.

How it works is you bolt up the one rim to the stuck hub.
The you insert a hydraulic bottle jack with its base against
a base plate welded to the other rim, and the business end
against the end of the axle (threads protected by axle
nuts). Then simply pump the jack until the drum comes off.

I had a front wheel bearing heat seize from lack of
lubrication, so badly the inner bearing race welded itself
to the stub axle. This puller just ripped the drum right
off. Some filing of the burring on the axle and new bearings
later and the bus was back on the road.

This is a very easy puller to make out of some scrap steel
and a pair of rims, and I've never seen it fail or damage a
drum. Of course, up here on the Highveld it's not quite as
wet as Washington, so we don't have quite the same rust
issues.
