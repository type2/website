Subject: Re: [VB] heat exchangers vs J tubes

ah, here we go with the difference between turbulent and laminar flow. the 
fins sticking into the tube make turbulent flow, mixing the air up, it is better 
for passing heat to the metal from  the air flowing past.  the smooth tube 
has laminar flow w/ air moving fast in the middle of th stream, but slow at th 
edge, and th slow air acts as insulation.  

so these fins make the heat exchangers exchange heat better.     Do they make 
the exhaust flow faster/slower?   I dunno.

On this subject, the inner fins (looks sort of accordion like in there on 
both sides) definitely interfere with the even flow of exhaust gases coming 
out the rear ports.  Likely does not matter with a stock/near stock motor, 
but if your's is modified by way of size, carburetion, head flow, etc., and 
let's say you put on an extractor exhaust - then the rear ports are to my 
mind clogged compared to the front ports emptying into a nice big round pipe.
