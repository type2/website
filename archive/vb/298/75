Subject: Need DD Sheetmetal

Greetings list!
 
I am in process of selling my double-door and need some sheetmetal. Some
of you may remember that I was hit this summer and now I'm trying to
source the critical sheetmetal for the next owner to do the repair.
 
What I need is the "B" Pillar that goes between the front door and the
cargo doors. The only problem is that I need it for the driver side,
which means it has to come off a double-door or a right-hand drive.
 
Anybody out there have a donor bus or know of somebody that might have
this?
 
Thanks in advance for the input!!
