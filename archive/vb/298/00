I cut cardboard patterns of everywhere I could reach and then cut 1/2"
blue foam (the flexible kind, not the blue colored Styrofoam) and used
H-2 rubber cement to put them in place. It deadens the panel rattle and
outside street noise and it's water proof allowing moisture to travel
around it and down to the drain holes.

I want to insulate behind the cab door panels in my '63 panel.

Has anyone else used this loose styrofoam beads in a bag method? Think
it is a good idea?
