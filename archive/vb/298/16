Subject: RE: [VB] stuck drums...

  I have used a 3 arm puller for years, mine is a Zelander designed for VW
drums. The concave in the puller arms is the same as a stock lug nut and I
am just careful to tighten them all the way. There has never been a drum I
have not been able to remove. I leave the nut on the axle as to not flaten
the treads on the axle and use a 8 lb sledge hammer to beat the crap out of
it with. I have warped a couple drums beyond use but did get them off.
  I did strip out the treads pulling a bug drum (12mm lug bolts) though.

ps. the wax trick does work, along with KROIL oil or PB Blaster

pps. Most of the 3 arm pullers I have seen for rent are designed for early
jeep hubs. Jeep used a tapered axle and used compression to hold them on NO
SPLINES!!!! kinds of like wedge mated. These pullers do not open enough for
a bus drum and the feet on the puller arms do not sit flush on the drum

I've had the same problem with my '62 :

The arm puller I hired at that time didn't help at all.

I ended up heating the sucker until it got bright red and it finally came
out, but the whole braking system inside had suffered.

I would recommend this solution as the very last to be tried out, or in the
case of a complete restauration (ie : brakes cylinders, shoes and Rboxes)
