From time to time I will make forays into the local wrecking yards and
pick up a rotary fuel pump off of some small foreign car. A lot of these
are frame mount and can be had for under $20. Add a fuel pressure
regulator and you're in. I'm always looking for little doodads to use
here and there. Always playing with different carburetors too.

Little late on this but,several years ago on this list
I had ask the question of what fuel pump to use after
your facett pump goes out on you.I was lucky enough to
get an answer from John and I,m sure Ronnie also,
point being ,get you a rotory style pump and don,t
worry about it again.8 OR 9 years with a facett pump
is great, but,I don't want to take that chance or give
that kind of info out.I got 20 to 30emails off list
from folks who had the same experience with the f.
style pump, the bladder didfunctioned and spewed gas
out everywhere.Bell helments use to have a ad that
read"If you have a 20.00 head ,buy a 20.00
