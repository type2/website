Subject: Re: [VB] Insulation?

Try your idea and let us know what happens in 10-20 years. 
The foam bags sound OK if you POR or heavily tar the contact areas. Loose foam peanuts would have condensation trapping surfaces where they touch the metal. 
There's a LOT of factors involved. Average humidity, number of passengers and hours of occupancy affect the condensation on the inside skin of the bus. Even the amount of wind, where you park, and number of leaky door seals effect the amount of condensation and rust rate. How about a humidistat controlled ventilation fan that turns on when the outside humidity is lower than the inside? Are they still selling the electric field boat eddy current rust stopper?
