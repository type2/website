I bought our 93 eurovan back in 95.  had a little less than 20k miles on
it and now it has about 130k.  Been a good vehicle with minimal
maintenance.  It's mostly the wifes car but I'm trying to find her a
nov. 19, 1957 delux (everyone keep your eyes and ears open for me!)

Enjoy the EV... it's a good car.

Well I broke down and decided to join in the H2O world of VWs.  I needed
a 
work van and decided that a '93 Eurovan would fit the bill.

Pretty nice vehicle that rides well and has good air and heat.  Still no

power though!!!

Granted the '66 is still staying so no fears there :)

Heck if the wife likes the Eurovan then I might get her a used late
model 
one and trade in here sedan.
