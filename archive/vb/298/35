Subject: Re: [VB] Insulation?

I agree with everyones comment about condensation and avoiding it, but 
car bodies rarely rust in the center of panels (maybe because there's no 
insulation!) but of course rust where moisture sits i.e. corners, seems etc.

In this we ol' country I've found that the best solution for this is 
cavity wax (e.g. Waxoyl) - this *will* prevent any rust long term.  I 
was restoring an early 70's Saab 96 a few years ago and it was amazing 
to see that where the factory applied wax ended the rust start and under 
the wax, the metal was like new - this was on a 25 year old car.

If the purpose of insulation is to create a barrier to heat and noise 
then I don't thing it needs to be bonded to the metal work it just needs 
to be there. So I would suggest wait for a few nice windy days (or 
summer!) for the bus and it's inner spaces to dry out properly then 
spray at least 5 litres of cavity wax on the inside of the panels which 
in itself helps to reduce panel noise (be sure to keep the drains hold 
clear, and the wax also needs a few days to harden), then cut and add 
your styrofoam peices.

I also replaced all the heater duct insulation with modern 15mm think 
industrial boiler pipe foam rubber insulation.

Just my experiences.

ps, it's around 5 degrees here at the moment and my (original) heating system warms the samba right up - well I can take my hat off inside :)
