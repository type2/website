Subject: traveling in a fried out kombi

. but of course they spell it 'combie'.

 

I'm just playing Men At Works 'Down Under' on the radio (7:30am) after
talking with RobK the other day.  We were talking about vegemite and I
couldn't remember the song.  He knew and then told me the first line was
'Traveling in a fried out combi'.  I hadn't heard the song for so long I
decided to dig out the LP, dust it off, and play it.   Amongst 'Salem',
'Bjork', 'The C*nts', and others, they actually fit right in.

 

Thanks Rob for dredging up old memories!
