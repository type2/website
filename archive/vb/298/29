The pieces you want are called "J" tubes. They take the place of your
heater box completely. Many of the ads in HVW or VW Trends has them or
J.C. Whitney. I use them on dune buggies and trikes all the time where
heat is not a requirement.

hey all,

    i was wondering if it was possible to drive my bus around without
the heater boxes ( heat exchangers?) and still have an exaust system
hooked up. so could i? i really dont have the money to buy new ones, and
i would only be driving it around till i got a job and could buy new
ones. ( im only 16 ). thanks in advance,


p.s.
  my engine is a 1500cc. i plan to put a beetle exaust system on.
