Subject: Re: [VB] Fuse Block Retention???

This clip holds the other side of the fuse block. It clips on the end of the
fuse block and then in the hole in the body where the block mounts.

They've even got a cover for you. Brand new and shiny. (I don't work for
WW...  really, I don't)

(I'm  guessing you have a 8 fuse block since you didn't share that with us.)

Oh, and did I mention? The online parts manual at
http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5867part.html is a great resource for
answers to questions such as yours.

What am I missing here?  On one end of the Fuse Block there's a lip that
hooks
in the bracket. The other end doesn't appear to have anything that secure it
in place. I've got 3 fuse block and they're all the same.  Anyone know what
I'm missing.  I've checked the Bentley, and nothing mentions it that I
found.
