Subject: Part available

I have a washer reservoir if anyone needs one.  It came out of a 66 Bus.  I'd
like to trade it for something but will take an offer if someone needs one.
It's not show condition.  The rubber cab is dry but it still pumps.  I could
use some used cargo door straps or make me an offer in trades or other wise.
