Subject: Re: [VB] stuck drums...

I think Diane had a problem with something other than the drums, it was me 
(or my 67 riviera)  with the stuck drum. 

  I went to the place where Veewee111 had rented the 5 arm puller, and they 
no longer have it. 

There are plenty of 3 arm pullers available, but I have had bad experience 
with the threads stripping with them, and this drum is STUCK!!!!!!.  I may not 
be super burley but when I have to get help pulling something, they say,"hey, 
this is really stuck"   

I guess I'll just back the rear axle nut off and hope driving around will 
shake it loose.
