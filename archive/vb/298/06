Subject: Re: [VB] Fuse Block Retention???

> What am I missing here?  On one end of the Fuse Block there's a lip that hooks
 in the bracket. The other end doesn't appear to have anything that secure it
 in place. I've got 3 fuse block and they're all the same.  Anyone know what
 I'm missing.  I've checked the Bentley, and nothing mentions it that I found.
