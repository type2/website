Subject: Timed It. Heat / Ice

The subject:  Heat.
Today instead of scraping the ice I thought 
that I would let the heater do its thing 
to see how long it would take. I live in 
piedmont N.C., this mornings ambient temperature
was 29 F, so plenty of ice on all the glass.
The drive was country roads, albout 45 - 50 mph
between stop signs. Started up the bus, no warm 
up time just took off. Once on the pavement, I 
flipped the control lever down so all heat was 
directed to the defrost position. At the 2-minute 
mark I could see signs of melting, a spot about
as big as your fist on the passenger side 
windscreen, the drivers side soon followed. 
At the 4-minute mark I used the windshield
wipers 1 time, this gave me about 70% of 
the windscreen glass clear. At the 7-minute 
mark the windscreen glass was ice free. I flipped
the directional flap up at this point for cabin
heating. At 9-minutes the cab doors slider glass 
and the vent wings were ice free. The side 
windows followed and were ice free at 11-minutes. 
The last glass to de-ice was the rear hatch, 
it was ice free at 16-minutes. At 21-minutes I 
unzipped my coat and could easily feel the 
heat in the air. The bus:  stock 1600 DP
(OEM Mexican) with german doghouse sheet metal
Hoover bit in place, thermostat, and all shutters.
