	Well I found a substitute for the Mylar. I found plastic cake
plates that were just the right color. I cut the circles out and presto
new lenses.

Thanks again for everyones input

	PS: On a previous post I got a tip from Mike Melbrooks (Thanks
Mike) 
I was told that a popout seal will do for a vent wing window or I should
say 
windows because one pop out seal should do both vent wing window.  I
took Mike's advice and it works perfect. It is doable with regular
clamps and because it overlaps the metal is should protect better
against the rain.

Thanks Again
Eric
