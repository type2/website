Subject: stuck drums

Hello list,
Please forgive the simple question. Been following the thread on stuck drums.
In the Bently (63-67)
page V-4 it shows a picture of a puller being used on the front drums. Is this
type puller still available?
Will it work on the rear drums? Would it be usefull in the situations I've
read about?
