No, change that. I just checked my mileage log for work, and on 7-15-03, I
was at 53K miles, an right now my speedo is on 63K miles. Rough math puts me
at 24000 miles a year, and that only includes two of the out of state VW
shows, we had four others earlier in the year. Dang, i'm puting almost 28K
miles (roughly) a year on my bus!

No wonder my brake pads needed changing after less than two years!
