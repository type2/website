You might see if you can find the VW (11x 905 205x) or Bosch (0 231 xxx xxx)
part numbers on it and looking it up at
http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ovhignbo.htm to see if you can find what the
original application was.  If it was used on a 1600 then it may work.

The main thing I would wonder about is the vacuum signal from the Weber.  If
it's not strong enough, the distributor won't advance all the way, which cuts
power but isn't very harmful.  If the vacuum signal is too strong, it may
advance the distributor too far too soon, which can be bad for the engine.
A vacuum gauge and a timing light that shows ignition advance will help you
answer these questions for sure.
