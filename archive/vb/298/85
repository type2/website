Subject: Re: [VB] Sapphire Radios

A couple years ago I went into Hemmings and found Wilford Wilkes of the 
Vintage Radio Shop in Brisbin PA to repair a Blaupunkt for my DC. 
Specializes in European auto radios but he might do a Sapphire as well, 
if he's still in business.  Ph 814-378-8526

Otherwise you could try Hemmings yourself, there is a whole section of 
ads at their internet site for people providing services like vintage 
radio repair.
