The 6 to 12 volt "repair" is actually a power supply mod. The problem is
usually the transistor and/or the filter cap on the power drop power
supply addition. You have to run the radio and the bezel light at 6
volts. If yours is a resistor drop adaptation there is probably damage
in the radio by now.

Hiya list,
Can anyone recommend a place to send my Sapphire radio to get fixed?  I
had it converted from 6V to 12V a few years ago by Brad Clausen in the
midwest, but I don't think he does radios anymore?  Not long after I had
it done, it started getting a lot of static, and finally gave out all
together.  Any recommendations would be appreciated.

TIA,
Ed
