Subject: Re: [VB] stuck drums

But, be careful no matter what type puller that you use to be certain that the brake shoe itself is not in contact with the drum such as when the cylinders had been leaking badly and the shoe material is saturated with BF then the shoes can become glued (stuck) to the drum. When this happens (BTDT) when you pull the drum off with the puller the shoe is pulled off with the drum and, in my case anyway, the Brake Shoe Push Bar will be broken at the slots where the Push Bar fits into the Emergency Brake shoe lever, this has happened to me on 2-separate occasions! So, you will need to back off the adjusting stars all the way (obviously) and then use a thin bladed tool to reach through the lug nut holes to separate the brake shoe from the brake drum before applying any force with the puller.
