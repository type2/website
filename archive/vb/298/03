See www.eMachineShop.com. Design your part, upload and they make it. Haven't tried it myself, looks interesting though. 

OBC: Dellorto carb in the '63 DC was clogged because someone over-oiled the foam element. Had to buy an air compressor to clean it out because the SO hates the smell of carb cleaner. Found out if you take the top off the emulsion tube housing and then blow 50 psi into the main jet housing you can shoot the emulsion tube across the garage in a neat, slow arc. Slow enough for me to trace & retrieve it. It's alive!
