Subject: Exhaust Analyzer

I want an exhaust analyzer for tuning carbs.  Does anyone have a 
recommendation for a relatively inexpensive tool made for use in  a home 
shop?

Gene Berg sells (according to their '95 - '96 catalog) a simple 
analyzer.  Anyone know how much these cost?  Anyone on the list have 
experience with any others that may be on the market?

Thanks!
