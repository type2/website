Subject: Jerome question, electrical problem

Hi Volks,

Whats the best route from L.A. to the Jerome Fest?
Hwy 15 to Barstow and then out the 40?
or drive the 10 to Phoenix and then take the 17 North?

Anyone have any ideas as to why passenger side blinkers would stop operating 
when the head lamps are on?

Thanks,
Chris
