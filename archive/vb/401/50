Subject: 67 Doka - Master Cylinder & M-Code

Hi all,

A friend just acquired a 67 DC.  I spotted a bug like break fluid reservoir 
attached to the panel behind the driver seat, just bellow the VIN Plate 
(it's a RHD, type 268).  Is it stock? Does 67 bus use different break master 
cylinder than the older ones?

On the rear gate, there is something attached to the inner part of the gate 
that when it is open, you can use it as push-step (or it is) to climb-up the 
bed.  Does this explain M-code 363?

Any idea?

Cheers,
Kemal
