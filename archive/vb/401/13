Subject: st. louis listees?

have a sorta-bus-related question for st. louis listees...
i might be buying a small chair from someone who has been reluctant 
to ship (says he is too old to lift a box).
was wondering if anyone wanted to take their bus over to pick it up 
and drop it off at a edex location somewhere :)

p-mail, please.
