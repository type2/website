59 was a changeover year for transmissions... early 59 have the splt case, late r59 the tunnel case. If you have an early 599 you can get an adaptor to fit the later trans in.? change was ~ VIN 469 xxx.

you can get gearing that is really high, which means you need a bigger motor than a 1600 DP?or it'll feel really wussy.
A 4.12 r/p with? bus 4th (0.82) and 1.26 RGears would be a good choice. If you are running 14"s,
I run a 4.375 with 1.26 and bus 4th and 205 75 15 tires inmy 61, with 1600, I like that too.???? I though of swapping it to a 4.12 r/p, but I like having a bit more power for hauling stuff and hills.? Oh ya, hills.

The 1.26 rgbs are what came on a 64-67, with the 46mm axle nuts.

the r/p ratio is 4.12 or 4.375 for stock tunnel case split bus.?? People also sometimes get a FF 3.88 r/p which is geared high.? Sometimes peope get a higher 4th gear.?? I had a 3.88 r/p with 1.26 big nut boxes on my 65 westy , with 195 75 14 tires, and it felt a little underpowered with a 1600DP.?????? Then I swapped to a new 30pic manual choke carb, and it had more power (that carb was nice)? 

Remember that these buses are old, and don't alway have the original gears in them.?? 

hope that helps somewhat

Hello

We have a 1959 and 1969 VW buses.  I had a 57 vw beetle split tansmission
along with the 59 axels and reduction gears in the 59 bus.  Ran for alot of
years but was on the east coast this summer and the trani went out.  Scrounged
around for an old junked 65 transaxel and by mixing parts of the 59 with the
65 was able to make it back to MN.  I want to update the 59 with a new
transmission.  Have a 1600 DP engine, which I would like to keep but want the
highest gear ratio I can get to the wheels.  Also have decided to keep the
reduction gears.  Should I go with a new 65 trani with the 65 axels and keep
the 65 reduction gears or update that to a 67?  Does the 67 have a higher
overall gear ration for highway driving.?
