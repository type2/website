95%: Bad ground at passenger tail light.  Either from the bulb socket to
the reflector, or from the reflector to the body, or (quite rare) inside
the bulb.  One fix: use a hose clamp around the bulb socket to clamp a
piece of wire to the socket; put the other end of the wire under the
bolt that holds the battery ground strap to the body.

4%: System voltage too low with headlamps on.  Measure it.

1%: Something else.
