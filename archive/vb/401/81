Subject: re:white crud on battery

Thanks for the tips. I got a new battery, and cleaned out the engine
compartment around the battery tray. I used lots of baking soda and water.

When I got the battery they sold some sort of battery protector spray. I'll
spray it on the connections when I get the battery re-connected. I think it
is some sort of red waxy stuff.
