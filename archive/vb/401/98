Subject: Suggestions for tap/die set

Hey All,

I came across an auction selling a 3.5 x.06 tap and remembered that  
I've been wanting to get a nice tap/die set as I'm putting the pieces  
back on my bus. Does anyone have a recommendation for a set that  
includes the above-mentioned size for the pop-out windows?

Thanks,
Conrad
