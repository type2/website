Subject: BNNTA event update... a week away!

Hi all,

I leased the entire group campground at Mark Twain Lake (Indian Creek
Recreational Area) for the entire upcoming Labor Day weekend (Friday through
Monday) and the rangers are looking forward to seeing bus after bus after bus
stream into the park again!  Besides the normal bath/shower houses, I'll have
the outdoor cool water showers set up so you can cool down anytime you want
to.  We'll have both dash plaques and event t-shirts available and folks are
bringing some cool door prizes along.  The event/camping fee of only $30 per
VW for the entire weekend ought to save you a few more bucks to throw in your
tank, so get your VW ready to join the fun seven days!

Drive safe and bring campsite decorations!
