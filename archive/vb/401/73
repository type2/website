Hi Volks,
Definitely not good!??More than likely it?is sulfuric acid.

? If you have a sealed battery and it is getting out you do have a leak problem.

? If you have the older designed non-sealed battery it is normal for acid to get out due to escaping vapor out of the fill plugs.? Check water level if non-sealed and refill with distilled water. ?DO NOT get baking soda in the battery or it will stop working.
? Either which way best to get a battery box that fits both the battery and the bus.? You can toss the lid of the box and even cut down the box height, so it will fit with the battery strap.? Just as long as there is something to catch the acid that gets out, and ruins good sheet metal.
? Also good to check out regulator output.? Could be it is putting out way too much voltage and boiling the battery to death.
