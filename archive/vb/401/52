Subject: RE: [VB] 67 Doka - Master Cylinder

Hello, 

	Just to be clear, is the DC a split windshield?  Or is it a "bay
window"

	What is the VIN?

	I know that sometimes people confuse a bus built on 8/67 - 12/67 as
a 1967.  In fact this is a 1968 model.

	If the bus is a 1967 model (with split windshields) then the Brake
fluid reservoir is not stock.
	If the bus is a 1968 model, then the remote reservoir is correct.

	Good luck

Hi all,

A friend just acquired a 67 DC.  I spotted a bug like break fluid reservoir
attached to the panel behind the driver seat, just bellow the VIN Plate
(it's a RHD, type 268).  Is it stock? Does 67 bus use different break master
cylinder than the older ones?

Any idea?

Cheers,
Kemal
