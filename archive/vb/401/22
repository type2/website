Subject: Jerome Vs. Treffen

Jerome Vs. Treffen, The Treffen is on Sept. 16 in Anaheim, CA. See the 
listing on The Samba under Community.

Gee, a fancy VW Show vs. a campout with lots of buses. I'm leaning toward 
Jerome.

Anaheim (been there lots of times) is however about 430 miles closer and 
Jerome (never been there) is something new and exciting.

Thoughts anyone? Which direction will the scales tip?
