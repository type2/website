Money.  Anyone can buy a car here.  You don't need a license or anything
else but the green stuff.

Now, California has a nasty rule that says that you have to get a
Californial Driver's license if you do certain things in the state:

"If you take a job here or become a resident, you must get a California
driver license within 10 days. Residency is established by voting in a
California election, paying resident tuition, filing for a homeowner's
property tax exemption, or any other privilege or benefit not ordinarily
extended to nonresidents."

So, if you have a job here, you need a California Driver's license.
However, if you doing something like "field service" from an out-of-state
compay where your paycheck is delivered to your out-of-state address you
might be able to skirt this, as well as california income taxes.  If you
are paid in California and they report the income to the Franchise Tax
Board you are pretty much hosed.

I have insurance through Mercury insurance via Auto Insurance Specialists.
They can match you with various companies to get you the best deal.  You
need insurance before you can register the car.  To register you need the
signed-off title, bill of sale, and proof of insurance.

'75 and up require smog tests.  Avoid if possible.

Ship your bus cross-country?  Drive it!  :)
