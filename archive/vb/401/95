Hi,

Just looked at Frappr. Lots of buses listed. Let's get some more of you up 
there so we can see where all the busses in the world are located! We have 
brudda's all over the world. South America, South Africa, Europe, hey where 
are you guys in Hawaii and Japan?

Visit http://www.frappr.com/vintagebus and list your bus.

Chris
