Watch out! Scams from the Netherlands are an everyday occurance... What he
will do is send you more then you want and then ask you to send some back to
him. It happened to me! Luckily I found out about it and nothing happened to
me... I strung him along for a bit for fun but it's not a laughing matter.
Make sure the bank transfer checks out before you do anything... and make
sure to tell your bank what it is your doing so they can look into it and
not pin it on you when the check comes back bad.

Just be careful!
