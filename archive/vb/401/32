September 14, 2007 - September 16, 2007 - Jerome Jamboree 
Gold King Mine, Jerome, Arizona 
The Arizona Bus Club proudly invites all VW Drivers to join us for the
Seventeenth Annual Jerome Jamboree. The 1963 Standard Raffle Bus is looking
great and you may be the lucky soul who drives it home...all we ask is that
you show up in a VW; non-Volkswagens are not allowed through the gates. Our
venue is located at the historic Gold King Mine (5 minutes from Jerome
Arizona.) Events may include the Pet Show, Body Art Contest, Chili Show,
Slow Drags, Childrens Activities, Raffles Galore and whatever else we dream
up between now and then. Mr. Bus Burger will be serving up Burgers and Dogs
near the front gate! The Gold King Mine offers tours and is a destination in
itself. Swapping of parts is strongly encouraged and a sense of humor is
mandatory. Anyone wishing to sell new items must pre-register as a vendor
(see the ABC website) to reserve their spots in vendor row. The caravan out
of Phoenix Friday morning is legendary and could change your life! Check our
website www.arizonabusclub.com for updates or email jdstanton5(-at-)cox.net for
more information. Admission is $10 per night per vehicle for campers and $3
a day for walk-ins. Sorry no walk-ins after sunset. Proceeds donated to
local charities including the Jerome Volunteer Fire Department. Gates open
at sunrise on the 14th - sorry no early admittance. If you can bring
something for our stage raffle we'd sure appreciate it. Come to a monthly
club meeting in Tempe to get all the juicy details and meet some new
friends.
