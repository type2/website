Volk-a-maniacs,

 

So, I get a call at work yesterday from my wife.  She and I have been
watching the housing situation in our neighborhood.  A few houses are up for
sale a couple blocks over and one of them in particular recently took down
their signs.  She proceeds to tell me that someone was moving in. and one of
their moving vehicles is a split window bus!

 

Yay!  A fellow VW spitty fan like me perhaps?

 

We took a little trip to the local squishy mart last night and just so
happened to do a 'drive-by' to check out the new neighbor's goods.  It's an
all white 13 window, mid 60's bus with Arid-zona plates.  That is all I know
so far, but thought I would e-mail the list and see if perhaps the owner is
on here, or if someone knows a person that just moved from AZ to Hillsboro,
Oregon.

 

Anyone?  Anyone?

 

Looking forward to sharing the split window bus hobby (more like an
addiction) with someone close in proximity,

Greg
