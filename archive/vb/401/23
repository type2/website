I ran the 3.88, bug 4th (0.89) and 1.39 RGears and it was fine, starting
with my 1641, but really fine with the 1835!  It topped out a little, but
loaded with camping gear it would climb almost any hill.

The last one I ran was a 4.12 with stock gears, and 1.26 RGears.  Good
overall, but a little tall for a 1600 sp with stock tires.
