Subject: questions about selling a bus internationally

hey list-

i am currently selling my original paint 1967 deluxe walk`thru:

http://www.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=500288

i am negotiating with a guy in the netherlands who seems really excited about
it and quite eager to buy it.
obviously the red flags have gone up in my mind because of all the fraud
stuff. any insight on how an international transaction should go done to
ensure that everything is above board. the buyer has given me the information
of the U.S. campany he works for and i am in the process of checking out a
reference there. h

he has told me that if i accept his offer he wil do a bank transfer to make
the payment. (not sure how this would work-i thik he said he would do some
money down and the remander once he sees the bus)

wondering what any of you have done who have sold a bus internationally.

i would welcome your advice- i am feeling a bit uneasy-
