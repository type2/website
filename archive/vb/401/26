Jerome

The Treffen is basically geared towards "pretty" vehicles with a pronounced
leaning to coach builts (ie: Karmann Ghias, Bug Convertibles, Hebs,
Rometsch, etc.).  I'm sure the requisite crowd of elite Type 2s will be
there, at least those that wouldn't dare "sully" their paint jobs with
Aridzona dust.

To enhance what Craig K said and to paraphrase a common "fishing" bumper
sticker:

"The Worst Weekend At Jerome Jamboree Is Better Than The Best Sunday
Treffen"

The fresh air of Jerome vs the smog of Orange County - no contest ;-)

Being "On The Road" - That's what it's all about :-)
