Are those magnetic fried egg turn signals in one of those pics?

They are there in one pic, and not any of the others.

The tail light lenses are upside-down, possibly to replicate the
'66-'67 model years that had reverse lights over the brake lights.

whoever did it had a little knowledge of a split's cosmetics.



wow....if you want a split that badly, get a split!
