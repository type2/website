Subject: a BNNTA delivery?

Howdy,

While getting everything ready for the upcoming BNNTA event in 7 days, I was
wondering if anyone coming will be passing through or near the Memphis area on
their way to Mark Twain Lake, MO.  If so, could you mail me off list if you
could do me a favor.  A VW friend has two Westy tents (the new repro BBT
"circus" tents) in the Memphis area and I'm hoping that someone might consider
picking them up and bringing them up to the BNNTA event with them.  I'll help
out with gas or take care of your BNNTA event fee!  Just let me know off-list
if you can help out and thanks in advance!
