I've been noticing a lot of white powdery crud around my battery. I've

my battery tray too.

What is this stuff, what causes it, and should I be worried about it?

Be afraid..... be very afraid!

Usually, this means the battery is leaking. I would replace the battery right away. The white crud eats metal.

From here http://www.batterystuff.com/tutorial_battery.html#5 :

5. Battery Maintenance is an important issue. The battery should be cleaned using a baking soda and water mix;
a couple of table spoons to a pint of water. Cable connection needs to be clean and tightened. Many battery
problems are caused by dirty and loose connections. A serviceable battery needs to have the fluid level
checked. Use only mineral free water. Distilled water is best. Don't overfill battery cells especially in
warmer weather. The natural fluid expansion in hot weather will push excess electrolytes from the battery. To
prevent corrosion of cables on top post batteries use a small bead of silicon sealer at the base of the post
and place a felt battery washer over it. Coat the washer with high temperature grease or petroleum jelly
(Vaseline), then place cable on the post and tighten. Coat the exposed cable end with the grease. Most folks
don't know that just the gases from the battery condensing on metal parts cause most corrosion.
