Subject: New Run shirts- Search & Rescue, bus, other

  Howdy all. Since the last run of Air Cooled Search & Rescue Team shirts sold
so quickly, I am doing another run. I will also be reprinting the Truckin'
shirts, with the single cab and double cab graphic, a frontal shot of a
split-window bus, and also a logo shirt for my new website- TeamSpatula.com
Pictures of the designs are viewable at:

http://teamspatula.com/tshirts.html

You can also see Thom's panel with the Search & Rescue logo at:
http://www.calweb.com/~thom/cgi-bin/gallery-search.cgi?string=search+and+rescue

Anyway, For those of you new to this process, I am offering the shirts by
pre-order, which means that I will take orders up until September 14, and then
place the order for shirts with the printer. After the shirts are printed, I
will ship them out to you.
All shirts are 100% pre-shrunk cotton, usually Hanes Beefy T's or Fruit of the
Loom. Search & Rescue shirts will be exactly as they appear on the website.
Truckin' shirts will also be on a gray shirt, and tie-dye will NOT be an option
this time. The split window shirt is a front view of a red and white bus on a
blue t-shirt.
Shirts are $15.00 for short sleeve, and are available in sizes child's M
through adult XL.
 Adult XXL and XXXL are available for an additional $5.00.
Long sleeve shirts are available for an additional $5.00

What I need:
send check or money order payable to:
Richard Palmer
121-C Park Ave
Raleigh, NC 27605-1832
Also, send an index card with your name, mailing address, e-mail address, SIZE
of shirt, DESIGN of shirt(Search & Rescue, Truckin', Split), and QUANTITY of
shirts.

I had hoped to have PAYPAL set up for this run, but it's not quite ready.
Anyway, feel free to e-mail me with any questions. I have sold shirts here for
the last 6 years, and have many happy customers as references.
Thanks, and happy bussing!
