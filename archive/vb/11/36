First a little history about a little accident that at the time seemed =
like a bummer but has since proved to be a blessing.

When I got the Binz it had the leakiest 1600 in it I had ever owned.  =
Oil oozed from every joint, nook, cranny, and crevice.  It seemed to =
leak oil like a fat man sweats in a basketball game on a hot day.  The =
tranny that was in it was working fine but wasn't original and had small =
nut reduction gears.  Since I intended to drive this truck far and wide =
I knew both of those would be changed out soon and new reliable units =
would be put in their place which were set up for the kind of driving I =
wanted to do.

My new Rancho freeway flier tranny had arrived and a buddy of mine from =
AZ was up to visit (and clean me out of extra VW parts) and offered to =
help me put the tranny in.  Well Scott is a small guy, about 6'5 and 325 =
or so pounds.  Long story short I was under the truck and the tranny =
just needed another 1" or so of forward movement to sit where it should =
be but it wasn't going.  Well, Scott decided to give it a shove.  In one =
of those flashes of clarity where your eyes and mind move at the speed =
of light I saw the truck coming forward off the jack stands.  In about =
1/100th of a second I realized there was no way I would be able to get =
out from underneath the truck in time so positioned my head where it =
wouldn't be crushed, figured I might need it later, and wedged my hand =
under the transmission saddle and my elbow on the concrete.  The truck =
lowered itself in a slow arcing motion down into my hand.  So there I am =
with my elbow and bottom of my upper arm grinding into the pavement, my =
forearm straight up, and the transmission saddle and the weight of the =
entire back half of the truck resting on the palm of my hand.  Not fun.  =
I'm thinking "As soon as the bones in my arm break I'm screwed."  So I =
say to Scott, calmly for some reason, "You think you could get the =
jack?"  Of course Scott is in "Oh shit" mode now.  He throws the floor =
jack under the bus and starts pumping the handle.  Of course the jack is =
all the way at the bottom of its travel so he has a ways to pump.  "You =
really need to hurry" I say just in case he hadn't figured that out.  =
After what seemed like a day and a half (10 seconds?) I finally feel the =
weight is beginning to be lifted off my arm.  Whew!  Other than a sore =
arm I was fine.  Scott had however punched a pretty good sized whole in =
my drivers side Belly pan with the floor jack.  Oh well.  We agree it =
would be best not to tell my wife, a Safety professional by trade, about =
the incident for a year or two...maybe more.=20

I was bummed about the hole but now it is looking like that was a good =
thing after all, First, I learned to always throw the wheels and tires =
under the bus, stacked if possible, if you have them off.  Would have =
held the bus up instead of my arm.  Second, since the belly pan had a =
hole in it I had to have John and Brian replace it.  In taking of the =
belly pan they found a bit more that needed replaced.  Not that I am =
excited about the extra cost but if they hadn't of taken of the pan to =
replace it they wouldn't have found the rust so I would have ended up =
redoing everything again in a year or two.  Better to do it now.
