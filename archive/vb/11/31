Ellis installed Kuhmo 205/75/15's on the 63 EZ camper.
Coupled with the 3.88 tranny it was great! Bad A**ed
tires/tyres. Initial concerns with being "too big" or
reducing the fan speed and thereby running the engine
hot were quickly put aside.

I'd highly recommend that brand and size. Pmail for
current owners impressions for a comparison.
regards,
