Subject: Re: [VB] Owner's manual for '67 deluxe

Reminds me of a line from an original 'Coneheads' skit on SNL--'Astronauts on
the moon?  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!'   67 Deluxe manual?  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

But seriously, the '67 Deluxe owner's manual might as well be the Holy Grail.
No one selling auto literature on the Internet ever has one.  About once a
year you may find one on eBay.  The last one I saw there was mint and sold for
over $140.

Good luck on your quest.
