Just a comment here:

Some of the spray foam insulation is self sealing (don't cut it once
applied) and some of the sheet foam is close pore.  This is better for
avoiding water build up -- what Clara mentioned.

I have seen rust encourage by the spray foam, by fluffy insulation packed 
into spaces, and by the squishy foam insulation- which acts as a sponge and 
literally was wet to the touch glued to the ceiling inside a bus from 
dragging water from the air. 

I used the shiny bubble wrap stuff you can buy in rolls from home depot,
with 
the concept that it would not in of itself retain water.    Cut they to
shape 
with a pair of scirrors- real easy to work with. I used a couple layers
above 
the head.
