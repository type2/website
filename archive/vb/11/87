Well, the 'R' in the size designation does stand for radial, but did VW
specify reinforced sidewalls as a minimum on the later (radial equipped) bay
windows and vanagons.  VW never specified 185r14s on splits, they specified
(from 64-67) 7.00 x 14 6PR on the station wagons, and 7.00 x 14 8pr on the
trucks, or so states my Chilton.

True, but the difference is something like 2% of the aspect ratio,
negligible in the real world.

True again, for one thing our busses came with bias ply (cross ply) tires.
With the quality of radial tires today it would be silly to go with bias ply
tires on a bus that is driven regularly.

I curious as to where you came up with 5400 lbs.  The placard in my 67 shows
a GWVR of something like 2000 kg, or roughly 4400 lbs.  My Chilton (I assume
for the early bay windows, Chilton is horrible at actually matching specs to
model years) lists the unladen weight of a kombi as 2624 lbs, with a 2171 lb
possible payload, adding up to a gross weight of 4795.  If you really have
loaded your bus down to the point that is weights 5400 lbs, 35/45 psi don't
seem at all out of line, though you would have to know where to weight is to
get the front/rear bias correct.  I'll bet you bus doesn't actually weight
that much, and you will wear the center of the tread at that pressure
though.  As an unscientific test: drive briefly and slowly though some dirt
(the should of a highway maybe), then get out and look at your tires.  Are
they dirty all the way to the edge of the tread?  If not, your pressures are
too high, and it will affect tire wear.  (Seeing this on my bus is what
convinced me that 40 psi was to much for the rear of my lightly loaded bus.)

This is true to an extent, car makers do often reccomend lower pressures
than those that generate best handling.  This is also their defense for
their tires blowing up on certain Ford vehicles, so anything BFS says on the
matter must be taken in that context as well though.

Actually, underinflation will wear the edges of the tire first, meaning less
tread depth on the edge, and more in the center.  But pressures are not the
only thing that affect uneven wear; wheel alignment, driving styles and
placement on the car also have an effect.  Front tires will tend to wear
more on the edges, and rear tires more in the center (on most rear-drive
cars at least).  Camber can make a big difference, so on at stock splitty
with something like +3 degrees of camber in the rear, i would not be
surprised to see the outside edge of the tire wearing faster than the inside
edge.

Also, fwiw, one does not need to buy a 'GOOD tread guage', a ruler and a
good eye work just fine.

Would be interesting to see.  I worked at a tire shop for a while and never
even heard of such a chart.  I can tell you that most people at tire shops
don't know a thing about how much air should go in any given tire on any
given car.  They tend to just put 32 psi in every car and 35 psi in every
truck without ever thinking or caring what the specs are or what is
appropriate.
