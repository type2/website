Subject: Re: [VB] 6 volt battery

Don't know what the rest of the list thinks, but I have had great luck with 
the Tractor Supply Co.'s 8 Volt Tractor battery in my 6 volt VW.  The extra 
voltage is great for lights and such and has little effect on bulb life.

This was a trick my grandfather told me.  He would run 8 Volt batteries in 6 
Volt John Deere tractors.

Hope that helps,
Mike

Ok, the at least 21 year old 6 volt battery in my 65 is finally dead.....
I'm having trouble finding any replacements....  But in case I do end up
with a choice is there any brands or types any one has good luck with?
Or does anyone have any leads on one....
