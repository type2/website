Subject: Tale of two engines

    Well after my 2000 plus engine break in to Colorado, I broke it. It was
MY fault as in my hast to make the journey I didn't have time to set up my
Rocker geo properly, which has resulted in an irritable tick from the valve
train that I personally can't and don't want to live with. So today I did an
engine swap and put ol reliable back in 1776 single port, except this time
with the new Kadrons off of my 1800. I can now notice the difference in the
2 engines with the 1800 having a hell of a lot more torque and for some
reason a lot more RPM's. After I do the repairs on the 1800 I am taking it
over to the new VW dyno guy here in Havasu to see what it really has for
poop and to dial it in. After all is said and done I will pull the 1776 out
of the bus, tear down for inspection, re ring it, for sh#ts and giggles and
take it to the dyno guy to see what kind of ponies and stump pulling numbers
it comes up with. I find this to be a good experiment as a way to compare
the difference in engine cost on the 1776 verses the 1800 stroker.  He has
all the specs on a new Mexico 1600 allready to compare to.
    For those of you who read all the VW Rags it was the Havasu dyno that
did the exhaust test I think that were in the last issue of VW Trends.

ps. all dyno work will be done using the same exhaust system and crabs, with
jetting tried on both to obtain the max hp and pulling ponies.
