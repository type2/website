FULLMOONBUSCLUB

WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO EXTEND AN INVITATION TO ALL VW BUS
OWNERS/ENTHUSIASTS ACROSS AMERICA.

We are hosting the First East Meets West IndigeBus Fest October 5th through
the 8th.  (yep...ColumBUS Day Weekend.)
This event will be held on the pristine 850 Acre Phoenix Ranch in Birch
Tree, Missouri.  The Phoenix Ranch is located along the Jacks Fork River,
and boasts miles of hiking/mountain biking trails.  There are also 8 caves
on the property, which will make for excellent acoustics while drumming
and/or didgeridoing.  There are canoes available for rental right on the
property, and weather permitting, we will even have canoe races.
There will be events, prizes, and surprises....
Camping is 5 bucks per person per night.  There will be a community fire
pit, but you can still have your own if ya like.
Dogs are welcome as long as owners maintain them.
There is a Sacred Lodge on the premises, where you can participate, or
observe, a Native American Sweat, drumming, didging, etc..
There will be events throughout the weekend, including a Chili Cookoff on
Saturday.and a Spaghetti Dinner on Sunday. (don't worry, we wont forget the
vegetarians..:o)...Other events include: Family Feud, Mud Pit, tug of war at
the Mud Pit,..Slow Drag, Tie Dye,  Fan Belt toss, Cave excursions,
didgeridoo and drumming techniques..spare tire rolling relays..etc
Events for the young, and the young at heart..Events for Adults, ..maybe
even an event for the dogs...
There will be raffles, prizes for various categories, bartering, etc....and
if all goes as planned, posssssssssibly even a music event!
So come on out and enjoy nature!  Meet new Volks!  Have a good time!
Don't forget..Bring your instruments!  Some food will be available from some
of the clubs, for a donation...or you can bring your own..
Please bring your own plate and eating utensils, as this will lower our
impact on the environment.  Bring Fishing gear if you
would like, and to bring a shirt/item or something to tie-dye.....
