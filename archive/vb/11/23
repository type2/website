Subject: RE: Engine rebuild - What would you do?

Short answer:  Nothing.

"The motor runs well, has good compression, and starts right up every time."
Good.
"The three problems with it are: high idle 1800rpm(dual Kadrons) that I've
tried to mess with, but that's as low as I can get it,"  So what...  Maybe a
CDI module would help.  I run Weber 34ICTs and they idle very low with a
good spark provided by the Tiger CDI.  
"oil seems to be leaking everywhere, (but pressure gauge still shows 35 -
40)"  No pressure problems, but depending on the leaks I would consider
tearing it down and resealing it.  Tedious process to keep all the parts
back in the right spots.
"and it backfires due to rusted out exhaust (I believe)."  Since you are in
Conn. get a SS unit from Bus Depot for ~$125ish.
"I don't have that kind of money right"  There you go, decision made :)


Take Care,
Adrian
