do you have a case saver in there?  Sounds like you may need a new (larger 
one) installed.  What kind of case do you have- meaning what is the cases 
serial number- unde rthe gen stand.  usually only the H or B or earlier cases 
pull studs, A cases or later cases have a better alloy.   If you can get a 
case saver installed it is usable.

remove cylinders - marking which is which
remove pistons- marking ditto
- inspect ps and cs
at this point I would inspect the rod bearings

clean cylinder mating area on case and cylinders.  I use sealant, the paper o 
gasket, and more sealant, which I install on the cylinder.
install rods, pistons, cylinders

install heads before the sealant dries.  

so clean, then install rods, working one side at a time, put goo, gasket, goo 
on cylinders, compress rings on piston into cylinder (orient rings and 
pistons properly), installed those ps/cs, install head (with PRTubes- which 
you should have stretched out a tad) do the PRTubes seal look squishy and 
new- or do they have crucnhy bits?

refer to idiot book for details of installation/inspection

far enough, not too far.  measure ones that did not pull out.  ones that are 
the same length.
