Subject: Hurst bumpers

The '56 Kombi that I own has the body holes and brackets for Hurst bumpers.  
Do any of you have any for sale?  Do any of you know of anyone making 
reproductions?  I searched the archives and there lies mention of a member of 
OCTO who was making them.  I tried to e-mail OCTO for info, but was returned 
undeliverable.  Any help/advice is appreciated.  Thanks.
