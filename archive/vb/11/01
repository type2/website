Just dont hit it with a pressure washer.  I will do a
rehab once in awhile on a house and I never use that
cheap-ass Home Depot Behr paint because it doesnt
cover well or hold up.  I will be curious to see how
long it last before it peels off in chunks.  Did you
know that name-brand manufacturers usually make a
cheaper, lower quality product specifically for Home
Depot?  

I must give you credit for not painting it like a
hippy bus however.  :-)
