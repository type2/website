Subject: RE: [VB] Air compressor and water


I did some reading on this and one solution I saw was a "sine wave" shaped 
output line from the compressor if you can visualize that. Essentially a 
series of traps, 6 in the one I saw, fixed to a small section of wall next 
to the compressor each with a tap at the low point as mentioned in the post 
below.  I understand heating the air after this section also helps perhaps 
by heating the final section of air line, as in heat tape (NE guys should 
know this one), which will help in avoiding condensation when it exits the 
line and expands, hence a temperature drop in air temp which can precipitate 
water.
