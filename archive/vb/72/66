Go to our club website below and click on the southeast clubs. The scene is
pretty active down there. They all meet every Saturday at Burger King In
Clearwater(great meet) they have their own little section and the hot rods
have theirs!
There are quite a few clubs down there, so just check them out on the
website and then we you get down there you can give them a try.
Also take a look at the SE  Event planner for a full list of events down
this way.
Good luck with the move!
