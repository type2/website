Speaking of rubber seals, I dont understand WCM pricing.  Perhaps someone
out there could make sense of this one.

Last month I bought seven window seals (thru my local FLAPS) to do the bus.
Average cost was around $15 each, with the one for the back window running
about $25.  I had them order the rubber for the real taillights a couple of
weeks ago thinking it would run less than $10 (I didnt check the pricing in
the back of the book before I ordered; my bad).  I picked it up yesterday
while I was getting the tierods; the rear taillight rubber was $27.  I just
dont understand how the taillight rubber could run more than the window seal
for the back window.

I guess when you are darned near the only act in town you can get away with
that.
