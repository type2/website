What is the difference in the Engine Lid Locks between a 66 and 67 Bus?  =
The one that is on my Decklid seems to long, even after adjusting the =
striker all the way back.  The backside of the lock itself hits the =
Apron.  The hook device goes about 1/2 inch past the plate.  I went to =
order one, but I'm afraid I'm going to get the wrong one again.  The =
decklid came off of a 67 Panel (that had no back up lights).  The =
wrecked Lid from the 66 (had some 65 items: church key gas door, =
shifter......) looks the same.  What am I missing here?

Dave
