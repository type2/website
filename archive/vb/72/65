Has anyone else notice the Splitwindow in the Verizon Cellphone =
commercial?  It's the one where the guy is going everywhere and asking, =
on the phone,"can you hear me now".  About the third to fifth place he's =
in maybe a dessert or something.  Right has they change scenes you can =
see it and over his right shoulder you can the rear half.
