Congradulations Wade, the mother and to the baby. A baby that big reminds me
of a high roof, why I don't know. It just does.

We have a new VW enthusiast in our midst!
My  first child was born January 30th at 8:22 am.
His name is Kafer and he was 9lbs 12oz's!
Think VW will launch the lawsuit against me shortly? hahah-  Since they
think they own the word Kafer.
Think they can go after him for putting his own name in the title of a
certain Automotive business he may run someday?
 On another note- Someone told me that VW gave college money to a kid that
was born in the back of a Vanagon. Anyone know of any truth to that story?

Bus update- While I was at the hospital my Barndoor got rained on when we
got hit with that "big" storm here in AZ. All that freshly blasted metal
now has a light coat of surface rust-  ah well, have to go over it once
more before moving it inside.
