Subject: I'm still here (until further notice)

Based on the mail received at my personal address jim96003(-at-)c-zone.net, I
guess my buddy Cliff has let the VW list world know that I've been a bit
under the weather.  I appreciate all of the mail.

Thanks to my co-worker Phil for bringing my laptop by 'cause the bordedom
here at the "horsepistol" is unbearable.

I was going home today (2-1), but had an irregular heartbeat situation crop
up late last night, so now it's not until Saturday at the soonest.  Didn't
even feel it or was aware of it until they told me this morning.
Otherwise, I feel just fine, the pain's gone, have ran the cell-phone
battery to zilch taking calls from all over.  And of course, hospital food
has the usual certain "cardboard" essense necessary to qualify as barely
edible.

Took my first walk from the bed around the ward today with no problems,
etc., and they provided a nurse to make sure I didn't fall down and go boo.
 Doctor's said to take it easy for the next few weeks, no lifting, certain
sitting positions as to prevent any problems from the catheter puncture
healing (dang, that sure leaves a bruise, eh?).  Guess no bicycle riding
for a few weeks too, but I can take short walks.

Doctor was a bit suprised at my on-going living arrangements, as I still
live in my 84 Westy (three years next month), partly due to choice and
partly due to my refusal to subsidize the obscene rents here in Ventura.
But even with my modified health situation, I have plenty of room to enjoy
my existence with most of the conveniences of "home" in the Westy and the
doctor, although amused AND concerned, has given it his seal of approval,
whatever that means.  I live where I can I guess.

At anyrate, thanks to all, I'll be back up and running soon.  Take care one
and all.
