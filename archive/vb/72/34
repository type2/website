Hi Rich,
The simple reason is that is it more complicated!  The other reason is that 
it probably was bought through VW or one of it's original suppliers which 
still has the original molds and the machine to make the mold to work.  
    Most original window rubber that not only adorned our VWs, but was once 
stocked at the dealerships had molded corners which cost more money due to a 
more complicated molding system like as must be used for tail light seals.  
     Fast forward to today.....  To make window seals inexpensive the repro 
window seals are extruded!  Kind of like playdough toy you and your younger 
relatives used to press out extruded lengths of playdough.  Then the extruded 
window rubber is diagonal cut to length and glued together!  
  To make tail light seals and original window seals with corners molded in 
you have to make a multiple part mold.  Plus have a mold injection machine 
that not only injects the rubber, but holds the many pieces of the mold 
together at tolerances of thousands of an inch.  Then pulls the multiple 
pieces of the mold apart to pop out the finished rubber and push the mold 
pieces back together to inject the rubber for the next one.  Our best guess 
is mold for the late 57-61 and late 61-71 tail light seals needs six mold 
pieces for each.
