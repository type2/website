Subject: Hoopty Doo?

I'm in the process of lining up some projects to work on during the summer while
I'm off on break.  One of my consulting customers is a large metal fabrication
outfit and the owner bugging me about the repo hoops on my double cab.  (Not
exact, etc).  He keeps saying "when are you going to let me build you up some
correct ones?, you get the design and I'll build it".

Is there any interest in sets of repo hoops being made that are damn near
duplicates of original ones?
