Hi Charles,
Changing the front beam to a 64 or better yet a 65-67 model is way easy (One 
weekend job even for the digitally challenged!) and you end up with longer 
lasting needle bearings in the front beam where the trailing arms mount.  To 
install the front 64-67 spindles you would have to convert thier trailing 
arms to fit the earlier reamed bushings in the front beam, or find the 63 one 
year only king pins to mount the later spindles onto the earlier trailing 
arms with the earlier smaller diameter link pins.  Eric&Barb
