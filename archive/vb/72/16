The easiest way to find out what you have is to find a vendor copy of WAWD
parts catalog or a World Parts, IMC, Beck Arnley, etc. These are what I use
as they cover ALL years and models of VW's and all the parts are listed in
order. Makes it pretty easy to find application, year and model. When I get
stumped on a part (not in catalog) I resort to massive piles of OG parts
books, much more time consuming.

I have a good amount of VW parts that I've collected over the years from all
models.  I need to thin out the bulk and I'd like to sell them cheap to help
out other enthusiasts but I need to know what they fit.  I'm talking mostly
about switches, relays, wiper motors and some small hard parts (not "hard to
find parts").  Is there a listing somewhere that I could look through to
find out the model and year used?

Thanks,

Thomas
