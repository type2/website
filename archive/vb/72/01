<< heya everyone- when did front turn signals turn from bullets to the big 
oval ones, and when did rear turn  signals turn from cicles to the ovals? 
also, on pre 70 busses, can you switch the 11mm and 14mm nuts on the clutch 
release lever to a wing nut?

they got the large oval taillight beginning of 62 model , unless a DPO cut 
them larger.

the fried egg front turn signals appeared on N American spec buses for the 63 
model, but the euro models got them in 64.

if your arm has the dimples for the wingnut (look at the bumps on the 
wingnuts, the arm has corresponding dimples) you can use the wingnut.  if you 
dont have dimples, the wingnut could self loosen.       You can change the 
arm, but really best to take the engine out for that.   the wingnut is much 
easier to adjust than the dual nut system.
