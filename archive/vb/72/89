Come on Down Matt; its in the 80's (in the Tampa region) today!!.

There is an active VW crowd down here; bugs, busses, ghias and things (oh
my!)
You will find however that it sorta sucks driving the bus around in the
summer months.  Its in the low-mid 90s with equal amounts of humidity.  And
lets not forget the daily thunderstorms that happen every afternoon between
3 and 5PM.

I live in Lakeland which is about half way between Tampa and Orlando.
Looking forward to meeting you

--Rich

I will most likely be relocating to Tampa soon for
work, and am just wondering what the vintage vw scene
is like there.  Any list members with club or event
information please let me know.

Thanks in Advance

Matt in half-frozen NY
