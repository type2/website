Subject: Steering dampner

Hey Tipper,
If you're still out there, I haven't forgot about you and the NOS steering
dampner I promised you. I had just got my new drag link from Bus Depot (buy
those guys are fast!) and so I need to install it and check my center pin
for play. I will install the dampner at the same time and box the old one
for mailing. 

Need your snail mail address again
