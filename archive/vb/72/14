From Stan:

(to get yourself up to speed, go to http://www.vintagebus.com/bentley.html)

We finished the Audi A4 manual and have about a one week or so delay before  
we can jump into our next manual for '98 and later VW Passats. Guess what
that means?, Yes, we can spend some time on the vintage bus book! Can you
please send me your nice copy of the '53 edition so we can compile our
camera copy.
 
I can't make any promises on book ready dates yet but I should at least have
a page count this week. I still would like to make it available by this summer.
 
Current title would be Volkswagen Workshop Manual, Type 2, all Models:
1950-1962 (RB code V262).
