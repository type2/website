Aaron,
I live in a wet climate up here in the PNW and I have found that if you are
using large volumes of air constantly, a water trap before and after is
necessary. I usually cycle my entire tank volume in one use and that sucks
in a large quantity of air in one shot, along with its moisture content.

Hi all,

While a bit off topic it does relate to my bus in that I need to finish
putting my roof on.  What does every body do to keep the water out of
the tank?  I have a water trap, after the tank before the hose, but am
wondering if should put in another before the tank (or is that too
constricting, making the motor work to hard).  I remember somebody on
the list (Scott Fraser Maybe???) who went to great lengths to make sure
the air coming out of the system had virtually no water.

It should be mentioned that I live in San Diego and it is a generally
moist climate.  Any ideas would be great.

Thanks,
Aaron
