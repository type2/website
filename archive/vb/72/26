Selling a `67 Bus beam and a `69 to `70 beam. Both are solid and complete, 
drum to drum. They're heavy and shipping would be expensive, so it's best if 
they could be picked up. Delivery may be available. Lots of other Bus and Bug 
parts available! Please ask! Asking $75.00 each for the beams. Will deliver 
to the Beaver Springs, PA show Oct. 21st (serious buyers only, please!)
