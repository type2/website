As far as I'm concerned, there are no rules. Do what you want. All original? 
Do it. Wild custom? Fine. My current project (with Ronnie's help) is a 63 
Micro that will look bone stock from the outside and have only minor 
interior improvements for the sake of comfort. An 1800 with freeway flyer, 
Berg shifter etc. A few suspension mods, sound system, and I'll have a daily 
driver that can exist on today's roads. What category is this? Who cares, 
it's fun.
