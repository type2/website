Since I have not owned the entire line of buses during the 70's, only a few,
I stand corrected

No, the 76 to 79 2.0L bus WITH auto trans uses the self-supporting starter.
There is no way to put a manual trans starter in a 76-79, there is no
bushing
hole in a auto trans bellhousing.  The self-supporting starter will work on
72/73 1700 and 74/75 1800 with a manual trans but it will NOT work on a
76-79
2.0L with a manual trans.
