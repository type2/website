Tom, where did you get the canvas made or do you have any more I need one
for my DC

ps. Derel Kreig (sp) sold his repo's (hoops) for 300 dollars, he has the
dies and would sell them if somebody wanted to buy them.

Hi Scott,

I've been thru this process, and its a lot harder and more expensive than it
looks or should be!  I took an og pair of hoops to several custom
fabricators and they were all scratching their heads on how vw made them.
The problemo is bending the metric size channels to the right radius w/o a
big $$$ die and keeping the bends from warping when they bend them.  in
addition, the compound curved piece that goes over the wood slats on each
hoop is even more difficult and expensivo to do.

Nonetheless, I did have a prototype set made and powdercoated for a whopping
$380 +-.  They are actually stiffer than the original ones, but not as
correctamundo as I would like, but an og canvas fits just perfectly.  The
maker has told me he can make them exactly like the og one's if I make a
bunch of them(he would pay for the die).  I am pondering that (sorry Hart!),
but I think that they are going to be more expensive than the canvases I've
had made, which is unfortunate cuz it appears you can buy the real thing for
less if you can find a set.

If your guy can do them more reasonably, I've got cad drawings of the hoop
dimensions, etc. that I would be willing to sacrifice for the cause!
