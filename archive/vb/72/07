Subject: Re: [VB] T4 tranny into a vintagebus

I worked on this one for quite a while and found that it really can't be done
without cutting and hacking due to the size of the trans.  Unfortunately, I
didn't take notes as to which dimension was the problem.  My tired and worn out
brain seems to remember something about it being LONGER than a type 1 trans.
The bus into bug adapters (I believe) are designed for Baja's and have the room
to stick the ass end out a little longer.
For the difinitive answer, talk with Joe Locicero at Oregon Performance
Products.

Believe me, I tried hard to make it work.  A buddy picked up a brand spanking
new rebuilt in an engine/trans deal that he happened on and was going to give it
to me as a "thanks for the help".  I measured and measured again but couldn't
get it to work out.

Now since you are talking custom and wouldn't care about cut and weld.....
I'll leave that up to you.
