Been there, done that, ship both ways all the time, send it usps or canada
post and mark it antique auto parts should avoid both duty and tax. Not as
expensive as some ebay'ers would have you believe. Stuff like brochure's
never costs more than $1.85 us. Don't; however mark it 'educational
material' will definitely be opened by customs who then will tax you to
justify their existence ask me how I know. Or do what I do, use it to
justify a trip to the sun ; )
