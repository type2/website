Hi Ric,
Remove rotor and drip one or two drops of engine oil onto the felt wick that 
is seated in the round hole under the rotor.  This oils the wieghts and keeps 
them from rusting/sticking and allows the distributor to advance in most 
non-vaccume distributors and some vaccume distributors!
 
 < Are you using a 2:1 ratio lower pulley and a 33, 34, or better yet 35mm 
inside measurement cooling fan?<< I have no idea. How do you measure these 
things. I *think* everything is stock 1971 stuff.>>

Find and move to TDC on your lower pulley.  Paint a mark on the upper pulley 
where you can align it to some part of the engine.  Turn lower pulley once 
and upper pulley should turn exactly twice.  If lower pulley turns less than 
twice, it is not a 2:1 pulley and will cause over heating in doghouse 
engines.  If it turns more than twice you probably have a 2;1 pulley and have 
used the smaller 905 fan belt and shimed the heck out of the upper pulley 
like we do on our buses!  As for the fan, measure between the discs of the 
fan with a caliper or tape measure.

Never stupid to ask a question, mayhaps funny 'cause we have done the same 
once upon a time!  DR means Dual Relief, because it has two spring loaded oil 
pressure relief valves built into the case.

That could be causing you alot of the over heating problem!
 
 <<What RPM for highway cruising are you using?>>   I have no tach in this 
beast,
 and I regret that. WIll put one in.>>

All you really need to do is wire one in for a fifteen minute drive and have 
a friend hold the gauge and write down the MPH at 1,500 and 3,000 RPM in each 
forward gear.  Just make sure to RPM the engine at each of these RPM/MPH 
spots in each gear for more than a couple of seconds to avoid the tach needle 
swing delay!  You never want to go below 1,500 RPM except for first and 
reverse ( In our panel conversion with 3.875 R&P fourth gear seems to lug the 
engine below 2,000 RPM!), and even in those gears you want to get above 1,500 
RPM ASAP safely without drag racing it.  2,500-2,800 RPM seems to be the best 
RPM range for cooling the engine.  On the other hand if you find yourself on 
a really loooooooooong steep hill and/or heavy payload going up a loooooooong 
hill and can not get the RPM up above 2,000 RPM in 2nd, 3rd, or especially 
4th gear it is best to just downshift and and get the engine  into the 2,500 
to 3,000 RPM range and thusly cooling fan speed up.
 
 >>You just might want to change oil coolers.  Some used oil coolers that 
were not used with a full flow filter setup have been known to have passages 
in the cooler to be clogged up allowing the hot oil less surface area to be 
cooled! <<  Is there any way to check this? <<

Yes there are two ways! 
1.  Replace cooler and if the oil suddenly runs markedly cooler, the old oil 
cooler had blockage.
 2.  Cut your cooler in half lengthwise and look for blockage.

 >>The 68 bus used a 30 amp generator, the 69 to 71 used a 38 amp generator 
that was longer and required completely differant fan to shroud tin.<<  I 
figured that one out on my own! How much of a job is it to replace while in 
the bus?  <<

PITA, for us it is easier to remove the engine and do maintance/inspection of 
various part of the engine, and clutch.  Remember you need to keep the rear 
of the cooling fan shimmed to keep .080" (4mm) from the generator to fan 
shroud tin or suffer cooling difficulties.
 
<<THanks for all the input! >>

You are welcome!  Make sure you have all the engine to body seals and even 
the engine lid to body seal.  Plus all the proper engine tin in place.  
Running an engine with just the forward engine tin piece missing will cause 
the engine oil temp to run 20F higher!
