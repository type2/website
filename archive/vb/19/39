Subject: engine compartment

Hi, All...
   Getting ready to put the fuel tank and engine back into
my '65.  Any suggestions on a coating for the engine
compartment? The bus will be a daily driver and I am not
worrying so much about beauty as I am functionality. That
is..noise reduction, heat transfer reduction, etc.
Comments?  Thanks in advance!
