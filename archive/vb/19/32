I just checked my Bus ('64 Standard, built Nov. '63) and it has this.
It's a flat rubber ring about 10 mm bigger in diameter than the steering
column or 5 mm wide all around.

I have this too, and I have two guesses about it.  One, it gives access
to something on the bottom side (like part of the clutch linkage, maybe).
Two, some countries or customers might have asked for a clutch safety
switch (starter won't run unless clutch is in), and that looks like a
good place for one.  I've never seen one of these - it's just a guess.
