  Did you feel through the headliner (if it is there) to see if all the wood
is in place? There are 3 wood bows that go from side to side and 2 that go
lengthwise along the pop top. Also if you pull the gray plastic trim piece
(I sell those, shameless plug) there should be a piece of plastic stiping
there that is stapled through to hold the canvas to the wood. I have a
complete westy wood bow set and the pop top for that matter, heck even the
roof clip with the hole in it, with these items I would find it very easy to
instal the top. It would appear that Westy put the wood frame work in first,
then cut the hole for the top, then very carefully (ya right) bent the lip
of the roof up with some sort of cust pliers, more like a hammer and dolly
the way my roog clip looks.

  So what it could boil down to is, does it look like the headliner was ever
replaced? and are all wood pieces in place??  It would be nearly impossible
to install all 3 wood pieces without removing the headliner, but you could
get 2 of them in.

More research, but who cares it sounds like a really cool bus.

When I was at Bad Camberg there were quite a few Deluxe Campers, but most of
those had DEVON camper kits, they are very cool because some of the cabinets
have roll up doors like on an old desk and beautiful woodwork!

Thanks for all the feedback on the SO-42/clamshell lights/Deluxe issues!  I
am still puzzled(not hard to do!) about the installation of the poptop in
the existing roof of the Deluxe.  If you look at factory poptops, there is a
very smooth curved bend in the roof metal that sticks up about 1/2" around
the opening and has a crimped edge of the metal bent back to the outside of
the roof.  Then the canvas is attached to this "curb" at this point which
keeps the joint up off the roof and makes a good positive seal to keep water
out. My Deluxe has this same detail as other factory poptops I have
physically compared it too.  Can this be done in the field?  I have seen
some of the American camper conversions, and they didn't even try this
detail(just cut a hole in the roof and relied on caulking to keep the rain
out!) so I am perplexed as to how this would have been done by a PO at some
time instead of Westy?
Anyone have any insight on this?  On the other hand, the hole in the floor
for the water tank drain, appears to have been cut w/ a torch.  Would Westy
have done that?

Again thanks for the responses!

Tom,

65 Deluxe Poptop Westy???
