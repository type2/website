Dave--

Check with AutoTrader--www.traderonline.com--in the classic cars section.
Their database of ads is very large and is searchable by make, model, year,
and state.  Still can't find anything you like?  Go to hemmings.com or
Classifieds2000.com for additional VWs.  Or try VW Planet online, there is a
large database of bus ads there.
