Subject: Engine Trouble

I was just coming back to town this morning from a friends house when I
noticed the bus was loosing power.  I look in the mirror and see a cloud of
smoke following me.  The engine is making no unusual noises and my oil light
is off so I kept going a 1/2 mile or so to a parking lot and pull in.  As I
come to a stop my oil light begins to flicker and goes out again.  I shut it
off and go around back to find a hot engine and some oil dripping.  I am
only 5 miles from home so I let the old girl cool down and I fire it up
again.  Started great and ran well for about 20 seconds when I heard a small
backfire and a distinct snapping sound.  The engine continued to run well as
I shut it off.  I check under the engine and find the lower half of my valve
cover gasket laying on the tar with oil leaking out of the valve cover.  Tow
truck time.  I have known this bus since it was new and this is the first
ride it has ever taken on a tow truck.  The engine has never been out of it
except when I did a valve job in 1991.  I think I snapped a valve.  Any
other ideas?  I had the tow truck guy haul it 60 miles to Columbus where
Mike Young of Motorkars is going to look at it.  Mike is a fellow splitty
owner and runs the best shop around.  I can see a new dual port 1600 in my
future.
It was sad to see my VW heading down the road on the back of a turtle.
Thanks for listening and letting me get this out of my system.  The kids
will be bummed when they get home from school.
