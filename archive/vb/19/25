According to my Westy parts book the clamshell light went up to Werke #
1049. Since this is a B42 Parts book this would be the start of the '65
B42's.

Michael Heron's '65 Westfalia is Werke # 7 and is the earliest B42 in the
Westfalia Registry. He has the clam shell lights and the vehicle is all
original.......... I have had a ride in it and seen the lights as well!

'67 Westy
