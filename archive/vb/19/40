no you dont need to swap redux boxes they bolt up to 
your existing spring plates. BUT if your bus has the 
original tranny i BELIEVE its made for a non syncro 
tranny so is your bus dose not have the modification
done to it you either need to purchase the weld on 
adapter or the bolt on adapter. WCM sells the weld on 
adapter but if you dont have a welder it could be more 
expensive. Wolfganng Int. sells a bolt on adapter for 
30 bucks you just have to grind down the middle hump on 
your nose cone a bit to make rom for the adapter and is 
bolts right in . hope this info helps.
