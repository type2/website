Hi John,
There are way too many ways for it to be siezed to mention.  Best to 
dissassembe the whole thing and do a whole and complete rebuild.  Do loosen 
the FW and lower pulley bolts first!  You might have to shatter the cylinders 
with a hammer to remove them if they are rusted onto the pistons.  Good Luck!
