A 67 I parted had a totally different base then the 66 I parted. I think
they used the dome light base from 1962 to mid 1966, then went to a all in
one unit.
Clamshell lens were used up till late 64 when they went to the rectangle
lens, then the all in one unit in late 1966. I'll have to go look at the
65/66? westy VW Howard just picked up to see whats in it.

hm- my 65 westy, and a couple 66s and a 67 I had all had the dome light base

with rectangular cover.  Have not really scoped out a 64 so 42.  Guess that 
was changed early 65ish then.  Funny how they change things at random 
intervals.  Curious about the date of your westy parts list, JP.
