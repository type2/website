Hi Jdd,
Either install the later tranny with your earlier 36mm axle nutted RGBs and 
tach the RPM/MPH at 1,500 and 3,000 RPM to make sure it was rebuilt with the 
correct gearing!  BTDT, our 1960 panel camper conversion came with a fouth 
gear that only hit 35MPH at 3,000 RPM!
  The later RGBs and brakes are higher geared and have 20% more brake lining 
which feel more like 50% stronger brakes.  Just make sure to install the 
bigger brakes on the front of your bus first if you are going to only install 
one one end of the bus and not the other at the same time.  Vw since the 
early 50s has always installed the bigger badder brakes in the front to help 
avoid 180 degree + spins due to locking the rear brakes up first!  so 
installing the bigger brakes on the rear axle before doing the front 
conversion should be avoided, especially if it is going to be driven in wet 
or icy weather!
