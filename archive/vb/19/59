Subject: Friday Detour.."Then Came Bronson"

Hi Real Bus People  I guess some of the "Old" dudes on
here will remember that old show from 1969 "Then came
Bronson"...What you dont! Say you were at Woodstock
rolling in the mud with flowers in your hair? Well
great because I wanted to be there but the east coast
is a long drive for a 16 year old without a car on the
west coast sooooo... I watched Bronson.Well anyways
what could be better than Bronson on his Harley
splitting bumper to bumper traffic with a splittie?
Yep...I know..Hippie chicks! well... I bought this
small poster last weekend and there it is....Some dude
sitting in his splittie in that traffic jam about 3
cars back with a suit on and white shirt with a red
tie and he tops it off with a hat! Hahahahahaha Man
are those days gone? Nope you say....Thats the way you
drive to work in your splittie....ahhhh... sorry Bus
Bro..ahhh ......Later.....
