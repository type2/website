Subject: Re: [VB] Insurance for the Bus..And Garage Thread

At Condon and Skelly, my yearly rate of $151 per year was based on my insured 
value of 15K on the bus and 2,500 miles per year.  They indicated that if I 
were going to exceed that amount that I had to contact them.  I am sure there 
would be a surcharge for additional mileage, but I don't plan to drive more 
than that so I didn't ask.  Bring it up to them and see what they say.
