I've had both, the dark olive green and the gold poles, but I dont remember
the dates on the tents. The one differance I have noted, is that the olive
poles came with tents that had divided doors on the bus side. By that I mean
the gold poles came with a single large bus side door and the olive came
with a door and a kind of window.
