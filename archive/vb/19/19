Had a similar problem on a motor I rebuilt this
spring. Turned out to be loose exhaust nuts on the
exhaust my dad installed while I ate dinner!  One
thing I did notice while trying to scope out the
problem was that the problem diminished as the engine
warmed up (because the case expanded).  In any case, I
would retorque everything on that side and check the
exhaust bolts as well.

Good Luck!
