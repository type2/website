For non-left coasters, In-n-Out burger is a regional drive-thru place that =
has about 4 menu items, serves only fresh burgers and fries of great =
quality. They've given out bumper stickers which are then usually modified =
to lose the B & R. You might have seen them at the Classic in Irvine. A =
company with class. Their annual T-shirt has hot rods and cruising cars, =
but never VW's. In fact, next time you're in one, suggest that they put =
VW's on their next T-shirt. More info at www.in-n-out.com=20

Reading my stepdaughter's work mag from In-N-Out;

"Jon has been a part of In-N-Out Burger since 1966, when Harry Snyder =
first=20
contacted him to make signs for the company."
"Jon's first job was to put a sign on Harry's old Volkswagen work =
truck.=20
Harry wanted the letters printed backwards on the front so that when he =
was=20
driving behind cars on the road they would be able to read the sign in =
their=20
rear view mirror."

So In-N-Out had a VW truck (singlecab)? Pre 1966, where is it now with =
its=20
neat decals?
