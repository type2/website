Hi Ric,
Did you oil the 009 distributor under the rotor?  Are you using a 2:1 ratio 
lower pulley and a 33, 34, or better yet 35mm inside measurement cooling fan? 
 Check your oil pressure relief spring not only for being switched in a DR, 
but also for correct lengths which did change from year to year!  What CR are 
you running?  What RPM for highway cruising are you using?  You just might 
want to change oil coolers.  Some used oil coolers that were not used with a 
full flow filter setup have been know to have passages in the cooler to be 
clogged up allowing the hot oil less surface area to be cooled!  The 68 bus 
used a 30 amp generator, the 69 to 71 used a 38 amp generator that was longer 
and required completely differant fan to shroud tin.   Eric&Barb
