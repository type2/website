Hey Guys, It's me again!
So I spent a little more time on the 64 last night and discovered that the
engine is not COMPLETELY seized.  It will turn almost a full turn, then stop
solid.  I turn the engine backwards a nearly full turn and it stops again.
Then, it can be turned forward the sam amount, etc., etc.  Does this give
anyone any more insight on what my specific problem may be?
