Subject: Deluxe Poptop Westy-Thanks & Another ?

Thanks for all the feedback on the SO-42/clamshell lights/Deluxe issues!  I
am still puzzled(not hard to do!) about the installation of the poptop in
the existing roof of the Deluxe.  If you look at factory poptops, there is a
very smooth curved bend in the roof metal that sticks up about 1/2" around
the opening and has a crimped edge of the metal bent back to the outside of
the roof.  Then the canvas is attached to this "curb" at this point which
keeps the joint up off the roof and makes a good positive seal to keep water
out. My Deluxe has this same detail as other factory poptops I have
physically compared it too.  Can this be done in the field?  I have seen
some of the American camper conversions, and they didn't even try this
detail(just cut a hole in the roof and relied on caulking to keep the rain
out!) so I am perplexed as to how this would have been done by a PO at some
time instead of Westy?
Anyone have any insight on this?  On the other hand, the hole in the floor
for the water tank drain, appears to have been cut w/ a torch.  Would Westy
have done that?

Again thanks for the responses!
