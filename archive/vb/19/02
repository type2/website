the code on the tag for westy so 42 would be A42, B42, C42, or D42 depending 
on which items (such as poptop) the kit included.   WIthout the tag there are 
doubts that it was a factory intalled kit rather than a well installed kit 
done after the bus was bought.  That said, my 65 westy does NOT have the code 
on the M code tag.But the rear area is painted blue white inside factory, 
rather than the grey of a regular kombi - mine is a kombi made into a westy) 
and the steering column and e brake handle are white.  And it has the area 
under the back seat at the drivers side where the knob screws in side ways to 
keep the z bed from tilting- the third holddown after counting the two seat 
bolts on the floor.   Unusual lengths to go to to retro fit a camper kit.  VW 
did prepare the bodies specially to go to the westfalia factory, where they 
then got the kits installed.  what is M 002?  hm.  good question.
