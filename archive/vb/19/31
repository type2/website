I just did a 1500 mile trip loaded with furniture etc.. - and a dog and =
2 cats - I am nuts! Anyway, now my transmission is popping out of 4th a =
lot and it is howling like a banshee.  I found VW dealer who shut down =
about a year or so ago and he has a transmission complete with reduction =
boxes, starter etc.  He says it is good and I believe him so I bought it =
and just have to go and pick it up.  I also got an NOS muffler, and he =
has an early blade bumper for a beetle. But I ramble.

Anyway, he says this transmission is 67 or so and my bus is a 60 with =
the original transmission - what do I have to be concerned about with =
swapping them.  I guess I would have to use my redux boxes hey?  I have =
15" rims but the 67 would take 14" rims - right?  I would like to just =
slap the new one in redux boxes and all but ... not at the expense of =
getting new rims and tires.  Is it possible to just pull my motor and =
pull my transmission and leave my reduction boxes on my bus? My guess is =
yes but .... I've only had it out as a whole unit.  The ol' fella that I =
bought it from assures me that the transmission, reduction box bearings, =
starter etc.. are all good - but he won't guarantee the solenoid.  He =
would guarantee the rest though but he wants more money if it comes with =
a guarantee.  I also found a guy who will rebuild my old transmission.=20

Anyway - any advice as to what I should do about this transmission is =
appreciated.

TIA list
