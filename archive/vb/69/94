Actually, my shop partner Barry was stopped a couple
years ago coming back from Jerome because he was
driving his 40 horse DD Kombi w/ dim 6V taillights up
a hill at 39 mph and the cop/hwy patrol/whoever was
worried about him.  No ticket, but I worry too.  If
you can't keep up with traffic, PLEASE be careful!!

Personally, I think that I'm going to try to stay
close to the speed limit.  Out here in the southwest,
it's really difficult to find an alternative road.  I
went on a caravan to Corona de Tucson last year, and I
will NEVER caravan at 49 mph again.  I've received
some emails telling me that they would be happy to
cruise with me, so look for Ronnie and my '61 Turkis
Flipseat at Familienfest this year cruising at the
speed limit!

(I have a few stock busses, and I go to my land just
north of Albuquerque at 60, but never again on the
open highway!  You may say "Let the truckers pass",
but I don't want to get in an argument with something
that weighs 20 times my weight.)
