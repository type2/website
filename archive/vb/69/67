Hi Thom,
That is the funny thing about volks.  If you put a real low price on a VW and 
you have a fairly well known name in Vw circles they assume you are just 
dumping a wreck, no matter how much you describe/photo it!  Reminds us of the 
time years ago we were living out of an apartment and having only two VWs was 
frowned on by the landlord due to only one parking space for each apartment.  
We found in a small wrecking yard a straight rust free 63 walkthru DD Euro 
slider with locking steering column, but missing it's engine, tranny, and a 
few small parts for $300.00.  That price even included delivery to any point 
in W. Washington!
  Since we were not able to do anything with it due to our circumstances we 
told everyone we knew about it.  All gave us a blank stare.  Finally someone 
asked us about that bus we had mentioned six months before, and by that time 
the wrecking yard had crushed the bus.  We are still sick about that one.....
