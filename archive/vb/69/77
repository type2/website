...I thought it was a nation-wide thing.  They're in NC, AL, SC, GA, FL,
MO that i know of 100%...and I'm not refering to highways that are a part
of the federal interstate system (which, to my knowledge, ALL have minimum
speed limits..).

And to answer the original question...yeah, you are.  At the very least
you need to run your flashers if you are below the minimum speed, and keep
a sharp eye on your rear view mirror.  But the letter of the law is that
you are to exit the highway.  (do note that minimum speeds are generally
NOT posted in extremely hilly/mountainous areas..at least not on the
steeper sections.  And where they are, they are usually lowered to a
still-reasonable speed.)
