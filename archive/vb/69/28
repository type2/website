Subject: Re: [VB] axle boot rating

i've got 5 minutes left of my lunch break.  i also do not know what kind of axel boots i use, only the colors.  I do know that they have lasted longer than a year though.

i believe that climate plays a pretty significant factor here.  you've got desert experience and i've got costal experience.

one of my vws had an axel boot for at least the five years i'd had it before i needed to replace it.  the axel boot was red and kind of thin.  the repair shop that allows me time, tools, advice and some parts gave me a black, thick boot to replace the old one.  the shop owner said that he doesn't like the colored boots as they don't seem to last as long.

of course this same vw still has a red boot on the other axle - maybe that is where the recent oil spots it leaves are coming from.

one of my other vws had these same preferred boots installed and they seemed to last a fair long time.  they lasted for about 6 years before they were replaced.

back to work!
