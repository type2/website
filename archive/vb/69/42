Subject: '65 Wiper switch wiring help

Okay my next quandary is this.  I removed the wiper switch in my '65 single
cab assuming that the terminals on the switch were marked appropriately and
reinstallation per the diagram would be easy.  Well I need to reinstall the
switch and can't figure out which wires go where because the switch isn't
marked.  It has the little embossed circles but no numbers.  Now recently I
bought another '65 wiper switch on ebarf because it was cheap.  This new
switch has the same 4 embossed circles but with numbers which are (clockwise
from the top right as you look at the back of the switch) 31, 31b, 54, 54d.
31 is a ground through the housing so there is no spade connector on this
particular location.  One of the terminals, #54, is double prong.

There are 4 wires that went to the switch, one of which is actually 2 wires
in the same female connector which I assume to be the power from the fuse
box and lead to the interior light.  At this point I don't know the exact
colors of the wires that were connected as they were painted white when the
interior was painted by the PO.  The Bentley diagram only shows 3 wires, 2
of which are connected to the same terminal, but no terminal numbers.  Any
ideas which wires go where?  Confused?  So am I:(

Thanks,

Thomas
