I know what this feels like.  I just got back from BBB
in Havasu (after going to LA for my Dad's 80th
birthday), and ran into Adin from Albuquerque in
Gallup.  After running 70mph+ for all my trip, I
slowed down to stay with him the last hour, and never
got more guff from the truckers!  

I listen on my CB, and when I'm going along with them,
the truckers are appreciative of my bus.  One guy said
"I've got to keep my foot to the floor, or this
Volkswagen is going to put me to shame."  But when I
slowed down to stay with Adin, I heard nothing but
complaints on the radio.

I'm really glad that I have altered my bus to go fast,
because one hour of traveling at 60 was more
nerve-racking than the whole rest of my trip.  It's
dangerous to go slow on the freeway out here in the
open southwest at anything like the 60mph that most
caravans go, unless you are with a lot of other
vehicles!  Not to mention LA freeway traffic.

So, those of you who want to stay stock, I can't blame
you, but I don't think that I'm going to caravan with
you.  Stay on the side roads, and stay safe!
