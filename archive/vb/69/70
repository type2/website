Y'know, I have a stock bus which I drive at about 58MPH.  I don't feel
terribly unsafe on freeways and I really don't care if some random trucker
gets upset at having to change lanes to pass me.  They need _something_ to
gripe about or they won't have anything with whichto cuss at each other
over the CB.

I prefer the side roads, but I'm not going to stop using the freeways
because I don't run the speed limit.  The speed limit is a maximum, not
the only speed you can run.
