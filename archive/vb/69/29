Subject: RE: [VB] CE Aluminum Safari's  first impression

  There new aluminum frames are as close to OG as I have seen (better then
there steel). I need to get a set for me and start working on some aluminum
OG style hindges that can be spot welded on.

Hi Ronnie,

Is CE still using the rectangle |_| shape frame or have they gone to the
more v
shaped outer edge like the OG ones?

Thanks,
