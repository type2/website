Hi Thom,
That is the funny thing about volks.  If you put a real low price on a
VW and
you have a fairly well known name in Vw circles they assume you are just
dumping a wreck, no matter how much you describe/photo it!  Reminds us
of the
time years ago we were living out of an apartment and having only two
VWs was
frowned on by the landlord due to only one parking space for each
apartment.
We found in a small wrecking yard a straight rust free 63 walkthru DD
Euro
slider with locking steering column, but missing it's engine, tranny,
and a
few small parts for $300.00.  That price even included delivery to any
point
in W. Washington!
  Since we were not able to do anything with it due to our circumstances
we
told everyone we knew about it.  All gave us a blank stare.  Finally
someone
asked us about that bus we had mentioned six months before, and by that
time
the wrecking yard had crushed the bus.  We are still sick about that
one.....
