er- think John misunderstood me.   I was using his bus as an example of an 
extreme customised bus as compared to a utilitarian workhorse, and said that 
people on any side of the issue can and do get dissed, whether it is stock 
vintage resto or extreme customisation.  guess I should include those with 
ratty unfinished projects as another group who gets dissed too.    And hoopty 
buses....   I am definately evangelical about greasing  buses.  (Grease is 
good.  Your bus loves grease.   Have you greased your bus lately?  the hinges 
should be oiled every 1200 miles.)  Just curious, did anyone really criticise 
you for saving that bus?  or was the criticism for  customising it? 
gee, never had anyone critcise my artistic taste. <joke>
