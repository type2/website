Subject: New US fuel standards two years away??

I have heard that there are new standards forthcoming, and I'm led to
understand this means reformulating the fuel we use either diesel or gas.
Other then that, I do not know what exactly this is or how it will effect
vehicles and in particular our old, but very cool,  engine temperature
sensitive VW bus. Anybody have more information on this??
