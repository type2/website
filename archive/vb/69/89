Subject: Re: [VB] Rear main seal replacement??

Rich,
Ours (oil cooler) did leak at high oil pressure start up and then stopped
when the pressure drops.
Now the tranny out put shaft seal leaked after warm up but the leak looked
maybe lower. Bottom line -- replace both when the motor is out!
Philip tried a good technique to remove the trans seal -- We drilled two
small holes around the seal careful not to hit the shaft or trans housing
then thread in two sheet metal screws. Then pry or pull out,  we used a seal

remover tool ( almost similar to the claws on a claw hammer) to pry with.
P & C
