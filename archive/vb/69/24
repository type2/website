I will have to dig up my old pamphlet, he's from down south, and I can tell
you that his product is top notch. One word of warning : if you don't have
anyone that can cut and weld the DP intake manifolds then you may not be
able to do the kit. If that is the case, I have a top notch VW machinist up
here that did mine and can do yours. Oh, wait a minute, I have an extra set
that was cut for a second motor. If you get the kit, I can fix you up with
custom manifolds. Here is a list of mods you need to do to your donor 1600
DP engine:

1) mount compression enhancsers to the top of piston 1 and 3
2) cut and welded DP intake manifolds
3) cut off type 1 bell housing for the starter or 68+ type 2 bell
4) custom frame to mount compressor/tank to (that's up to you)
5) buy all the pressure gages, hoses, fittings needed

I can tell you that mine cost around $850 complete, I already had a motor
that needed cleaning up. I also downsized my carb to a 28PICT-1 since there
was no need for max fuel, the compressor starts up and runs at 1600RPM. Good
luck, e-mail me if you need any help. I'm not Dr. Laura, but I can help !
