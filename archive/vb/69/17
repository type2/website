Subject: Re: [VB] rear hatch removal

Nathan,

Are you using an Impact screw driver.  If not go get (Beg, buy, borrow) one as
this job is really tough with out it.  You'll find that you use it more than
you know.  Soak the screws in Liquid wrench or some other rust lubricant.
Slowly they should start coming free.  One thing I've found to avoid breaking
off screws, nuts and bolts, Is that, when they begin to loosen, don't just
keep forcing it.  Take your time and tighten, loosen spray, and slowly but
surely the screw will free up, and come out and not break.  I use this
technique on any hard to get screw, nut, or bolt.  Works real well.

Good luck,
Aaron
