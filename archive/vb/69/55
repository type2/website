COOL! I was fortunate enough to have my Westfalia in
the Patch Adams movie. It was a great experience. they
paid me for me and my bus, i went to wardrobe and i
was fed for two days! You have to look really close to
see the bus but it was worth it. The director even
came over (Tom Shadyach , spellings wrong i'm sure) to
check her out and let me go behind the cameras when
they were filming. All of this before i even had her
painted!
