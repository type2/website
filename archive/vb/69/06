Subject: rear hatch removal

I am trying to swap the rear hatches on my 60's. The one is bent in at the 
top and won't shut, so I want to put it on the bad bus. I tried one screw 
and after fighting it for a half hour I figured I better stop before there 
is nothing left. Is there another way to remove the hatch? or do I have to 
take out all the screws? It is pretty rusty in there.

Thanks,
Nathan
