Subject: RE: [VB] Wiring harness

I got a wireworks harness for the 59 double cab... the only thing I'm having
to do is cut of the spades and tin the ends to work with the screw terminal
electricals...

BTW, does anyone know where you can locate the brass little cover ends so I
can really be correct????  As a backup, if anyone out there still has their
harness from a screw terminal bus that is hacked up, can I buy it from you
so I can recycle the ends?  All I would really need is about 1" of the end
of the wire with the little end.
