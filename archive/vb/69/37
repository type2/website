Subject: Re: Custom vs. Stock

Ouch!!! Those flames are hot !

When I wrote that some stock busses didn't have much personality, I was just
stating my humble opinion. I am glad when anybody builds a bus that gives
them joy,whether stock or custom.
On another note,I am concerned when somebody chops up a solid bus to build a
radical custom...But I am equally bothered when somebody wants to butcher a
restorable early bus in order to salvage a piece of original glass or rare
sheet metal  part. In either case the restorable bus is often gone forever!
On yet another note, thanks to everyone one this list for the excellent
mechanical information and discussion.I feel priviledged to be a member of a
group with such a wealth of useful information and experience.
   Above all,ENJOY your bus,
       BTW, I still enjoy an occational flame. It shows personality !!!!!
            Thanks,
