Subject: RE: [VB] axle boot rating

I have Brazilian two piece screw together on my 67 SC. They seem to be very
thick and high quality, but the previous owner put them on so I have no idea
where he purchased them. The only thing I can say for sure is that they are
five years old and there is not a drop of oil on them.

Maybe my tranny is low..... hmmmmm

i'm kinda burned out on replacing axle boots on a what seems to be a yearly
basis. it's usually not a problem of them tearing, but of the rubber
rotting, cracking, and leaking on the bottoms.
i was wondering what boots you all thought seemed to last the longest, were
the thickest, fit the best (not too loose or overly tight), held up best. i
have tried most availale brands, but each time i change them, i use
different ones, in hopes of finding a better one. 
please, keep it stock, as i will not use the taiwan accordion boots sold by
empi.
these are the ones i have seen/used:
febi/bilstein (red/clear plastic bag packaging). 
te-gu-fa (white box).
meistersatz (blue box). 
west coast metric (their packaging). these seem to have very thin rubber!
i am getting ready to resort to genuine vw (mexico) one piece boots, even
though it involves axle tube removal and disassembly. anyone have
experience with those?
thoughts? observations? recommendations?
