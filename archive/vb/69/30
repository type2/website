Subject: machine shop needed

***i have cross-posted this, so please p-mail or delete the list you may
not be on when repyling.***

i am looking for a reputable, quality machine shop, preferably in or near
the south bay area (san francisco) to do the following machine work on a
40hp engine case:

  inspect my case, consult with me and if necessary perform the following:
  check case for warp before anything else
  main bearing line bore (if necessary, and tell me what the case is at and
must go to if it needs a cut)
  possible thrust cut (if necessary) and match main bearings to the case
and thrust cut
  cut case for cam bearings
  will allow me to provide my own bearings if they do not have/cannot get
german
  power wash case when machining work is complete.

i am fairly certain it needs a line bore, but i don't have bearings to
check or to check the thrust. i also do not have the tools necessary to
check either.
the closer to the salinas area, the better, but i am not worried of it
isn't. i will use RIMCO if i cannot find anyone locally.
thanks for any help. shop phone numbers would be greatly appreciated.
