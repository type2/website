If I had a bus, Westy, single cab, whatever, and if someone bought or 
rented it from me so they could to treat it badly, I would become ill.

Maybe just me, but I feel ill just thinking about the whole concept of 
someone being mean to my bus.

I mean .................. not my bus. not my cats. not my wife. not my 45 
year old Dietz Little Comet kerosene lantern. Some things in life have too 
much value to not have value.
