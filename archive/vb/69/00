Conrad,
The use of the shims is to get the spindles to fit squarely on the
trailing arms.  There isn't really an adjusment for camber as far as I
know.  It's supposed to fall within a certain range and that's that I
believe.  Then Bentley specifically cautions against using shims as camber
adjustment which I discovered when I was rebuilding my front beam and
having the same thoughts you are.:)
