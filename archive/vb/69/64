Subject: RE: [VB] Wtd: double door panel for furniture store truck

I have a beautiful rust free hippy DD, 1250.00. Needs wheel wells and some
body work on the right side. Great nose no bumpers. Floors and cargo area
almost perfect. A true hippy bus that needs to be brought back to life.

ps throw an engine in and drive as is. Was on the road 3 weeks ago till the
engine blew
