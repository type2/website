They sent you a shock for the front of a 67 bug

211 513 031H                front
KG 5521  KYB Gas A-just     front
343144  KYB GR2             front

211 513 031H                rear
KG 5529 KYB Gas A-just      rear
343144  KYB GR2             rear

It appears that the front and rears are the same except for the rear KYB Gas
a-just, they spec a different shock for the rear.

OK here's another question;  I ordered from Shocks from a Bus parts company.
The shock that came has an eyelet in the bottom and a stud top (that goes
through a hole and accepts a nut)  I  called to tell them they sent the
wrong shock.  I order the shock from them to fit a 57 to 67 Bus.  They tell
me what I received is the correct shock for a 67 Bus.  My 66 has a shock
that has an eyelet on each end.  They als tell me that they've sold 1000's
of these shock and had none returned.  So if this is the correct shock.
What's going on with my frontend?  The picture in the Bently shows a shock
with eyelits on both ends.  They tell me the Haynes shows the shock on 67
like the one they sent me.  

This is in no means to slam anyone.  I had a big order that was received
fast and everything else was there.  I'm just confused on how this shock
fits a Splitwindow Bus.
