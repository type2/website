Subject: Wiring harness

One thing that has bugged me since I got the Single Cab back in '97 was the
condition of the wiring harness.  I'd like to replace it this spring and
would welcome suggestions on where to get a replacement.  I'd like a high
quality product as I intend to keep her for a while.  One thing of interest
would be a semi custom harness where a few wires could be added for
additional components.
