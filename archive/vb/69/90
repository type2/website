A couple of thoughts from lurkerland...

The funniest thing that I have seen in a bus was my wife and I crawling up the
Indio hill, East bound I-10 between Indio and Chiraco Summit. We were creeping
up the endless hill in the poor old 54 Barnambulator-camper following the 1998
OCTO/Classic weekend- driving at about 20 mph on the emergency lane with
VWHoward on our tail with a CB. Reportedly, the conversations between Fish taco
John and the truckers was hilarious. I was sweating bullets from frustration
and stress trying to get the beast up the hill. Thinking that I was up the hill
I pulled into the first available rest stop to "cool it off" and John
encouraged us on up to the rest of the gang who where waiting for us at the
Summit gas station. Funny now (to me) and beyond frustration at that time.

Secondly, I personally must concur that beating a splittie up and down the
freeways is a strain on the buses if you try to keep up with the typical 65-70+
mph commuter traffic and is stress on the flow of the urban traffic if you
don't (as a splittie driver) don't keep up. That exact point is primarily what
encouraged me to sell my perfectly fine and proud '63 EZ camper to my friend
Beto. I used to drive at 62mph which I find as the typical "sweet spot" for my
air cooled VW vehicles. Now driving the domestic truck that he used to own, I
regularly drive 65-75mph in town, to and from one side of the Phoenix metro
area to the other - and back. It amazes me that I am passed like I am standing
still even at the previously mentioned speeds. Phoenix (Nuevo Los Angeles) is
nuts. Let me out, please!

If I lived in a less urban area or had a shorter commute in a milder climate I
would not have ever sold the '63. Whatever speed you drive make sure that you
are safe.
