Hi,

For reference, my 65 has a pointed-end front bumper with deluxe trim. It 
does not have over-riders which I always thought that was weird until I 
saw a European (French) brochure for the 65 Deluxe and no over-riders 
were present.

Mine did not come with a back bumper when my family bought it in 79 - 
so, I'd have to assume that the back was slash.
