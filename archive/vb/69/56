Subject: 1957 SC for sale!

Hi Volks,
A friend of our's up in the Sea-Tac area (Between Seattle and Tacoma.) 
is selling his 1957 SC for $3,000.00.  He bought a few years ago from out 
East of the Cascades where it is dry and VWs tend to be fairly rust free.  It 
runs and he has had the bed blasted and painted to kill off the surface rust.
