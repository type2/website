Subject: RE: [VB] axle boot rating

  The longest lasting boot I have found are EMPI's made in the U S A. I
started selling them a year ago and have not seen a failure yet. I have
found that the Meisterstatz last the longest in our climate, 3 years on my
DD with 1 replacement at the end of summer.
  For those of you that don't know EMPI is one of the largest axle boot (all
types, over 300 styles) manufacturere in the country. They also manufacture
CV joints and axles. Over 80% of there building is dedicated to manufacture
of drive line products. I have seen them mold the axle boots and must say it
is really interesting.

i'm kinda burned out on replacing axle boots on a what seems to be a yearly
basis. it's usually not a problem of them tearing, but of the rubber
rotting, cracking, and leaking on the bottoms.
i was wondering what boots you all thought seemed to last the longest, were
the thickest, fit the best (not too loose or overly tight), held up best. i
have tried most availale brands, but each time i change them, i use
different ones, in hopes of finding a better one. 
please, keep it stock, as i will not use the taiwan accordion boots sold by
empi.
these are the ones i have seen/used:
febi/bilstein (red/clear plastic bag packaging). 
te-gu-fa (white box).
meistersatz (blue box). 
west coast metric (their packaging). these seem to have very thin rubber!
i am getting ready to resort to genuine vw (mexico) one piece boots, even
though it involves axle tube removal and disassembly. anyone have
experience with those?
thoughts? observations? recommendations?
