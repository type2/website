OK here's another question;  I ordered from Shocks from a Bus parts =
company.  The shock that came has an eyelet in the bottom and a stud top =
(that goes through a hole and accepts a nut)  I  called to tell them =
they sent the wrong shock.  I order the shock from them to fit a 57 to =
67 Bus.  They tell me what I received is the correct shock for a 67 Bus. =
 My 66 has a shock that has an eyelet on each end.  They als tell me =
that they've sold 1000's of these shock and had none returned.  So if =
this is the correct shock.  What's going on with my frontend?  The =
picture in the Bently shows a shock with eyelits on both ends.  They =
tell me the Haynes shows the shock on 67 like the one they sent me. =20

This is in no means to slam anyone.  I had a big order that was received =
fast and everything else was there.  I'm just confused on how this shock =
fits a Splitwindow Bus.
Dave
