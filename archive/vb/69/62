I conducted a side-by-side on Quaker State and Castrol in my '69 beetle and
found similar results.  With the Quaker State there was a sludge buildup in
the oil galleys and shellac buildup on metal surfaces.  No such buildup
occurred with Castrol.  I questioned a tribologist (educated oil guy) about
the difference and he blamed it on the ingredients in the motor oil.
Pennzoil and Quaker State contain more paraffin than Castrol.  The paraffin
can separate out at high temps and will then re-deposit on the metal
surfaces.  I agree with Eric&Barb about the Castrol - that's all I run in
Tubavagen.
