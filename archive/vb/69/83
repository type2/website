Well, you should narrow that down to 71 and on Super Beetle and type 3.
Classic beetle with flat wind shield to 72 used double eyelet shocks. I
know, I owned a late 71 classic and a 71 super.

Hi Dave,
Definitely for 67 and later type 1.  The bus from 1950-79 used the same 
double eyelet built into the shock mounting for each.  Eric&Barb
