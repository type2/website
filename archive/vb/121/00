Subject: RE: Steering boxes

Rex Rogers sent an email out yesterday on the list that said he had two
steering boxes one off of a 59 and one off a 66. Read Below

I've got a steering box off a '66 and one off a '59 that I don't see 
needing. Anyone interested? I'm at:

9442 Indian Creek Rd.
San Angelo, TX  76901

That way you can figure shipping to your house at http://www.ups.com 
. Get your shipping and then email an offer. I'm easy.

p.s. I'm gonna be cleaning out my stuff over the next few months so 
will have stuff for sale. Got some small nut redux boxes, split bus 
spring plates and torsion bars....lots of other junk like that I 
collected over the years. Most likely will end up most of the stuff 
on thesamba.com after I offer to the list first.
