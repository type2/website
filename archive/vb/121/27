My initial response to this was that it looked pretty legit. Further
inspection may reveal otherwise...

The company that owns ipprotector.com also provides some (to me) shady
domain registration services and hosts adult web sites. Not exactly the
type of company I would expect VWoA to do business with, but I've been
wrong about them before.

Scam.

Why?

1. It came via email.
2. It says in a few weeks, I've seen this email for months.
3. It says you can respond to the email with REMOVE in the subject line,
this tactic is used to verify you have a valid email and that you have
read the note in order to contact you further as they see fit.  (Like
sue you) 4. If it was real, it'd be on vw.com  IPProtector is a BS
company that bullies people, I doubt if VW even knows they have set this
up.

Anything received via email should be immediately doubted - don't delete
files off your computer, don't forward emails that say "forward this,"
don't run attachments, don't email people to tell them they are infected
with a virus, and never respond to spam, especially when it says "click
here to remove yourself from our list".
