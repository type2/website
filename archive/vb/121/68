Subject: Re: [VB] vacuum dizzy upgrade problems

You can pull the distributor drive and turn it 90 degrees to accomodate the 
vacuum can. Muir suggests a method using a pencil that worked for me. Don't 
just jump into this though, read the manuals carefully and know what you are 
doing. There are some washers you really don't want to drop into the case. 
And remember to set the motor at TDC#1 before you pull the dizzy, it is much 
easier that way...
While I don't and haven't run a dual vacuum dizzy (vacuum advance and 
retard), I have heard negative things about them. I think they were one of 
those things VW did for smog control, not performance. Got to make up your 
own mind on that one.
