Subject: BAP Engines

Hello List,
Does anyone have any experience with the BAP Import Parts engines that are
being advertised in the VW mags currently.  They are all new parts, or so
the ad says, at about $800 for a long block, and $11-$1200 for a complete
engine.

Anyone have any comments or thoughts on these engines?

Thank you,
Ed
