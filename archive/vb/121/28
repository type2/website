First, Thanks to all that wrote me with suggestions! Our VW community is
great.

 

Resolution - Broken clutch actuator fork. 

 

Requests for Help - 

1.	This is the second broken fork. Anyone know why one would
break?? Brand new clutch everything after last broken fork. 
2.	Anyone have another fork or know the best way to get one? I have
a 1600cc engine and unknown transaxle, but what is the difference in the
forks?

 

Thanks for any suggestions, wisdom, or parts,
