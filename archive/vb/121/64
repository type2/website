Subject: vacuum dizzy upgrade problems

Hey all,

I'm trying to put a 0231 167 070 dual vacuum dizzy in my dual port 1600 
and I'm having some problems.

First, the rotor's orientation at Top Dead Center is different from my 
009, approximately 90 degrees counter-clockwise from the 009.

Second, the base of the 070 is different from the 009 and has these 
protruding areas for a couple screws- this makes it difficult to choose 
the orientation of the dizzy because it interferes with the clamp for 
the dizzy.

I'm not quite sure what to do.  The 90-degree difference in rotor 
location is bugging me.  Is this a good upgrade?  Where should I try to 
line up the vacuum can- toward the front?  I'm totally confused here.

Any help is appreciated,

Chris
