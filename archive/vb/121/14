Just wanted to say a very big thank you to Ronnie at Old Volks for =
allowing us to come get the free bus this Saturday at his shop, there's =
nothing better than VW friends/owners that really share something...well...=
special. You know it's not very often when someone will just give away a =
vehicle/bus, and it takes a certain kind of person to do just that...( a =
VW person!)...you are the BEST Ronnie! (round of applause) This bus will =
be rebuilt and driving hopefully by Jerome or sooner for my good friend =
Bryan. This will be his first bus, and he is soooo excited right now I may =
have to throw him into his pool to cool him off here soon! I happen to =
have a parts 68 bus that will donate most of the needed stuff to get it =
together and going. So after it's here at Bryan's house, which is right =
next door to mine, we will keep the list informed on what we are doing to =
get it going again, with it's new owner behind the wheel...err, wrench... =
for now.  Mark & Tiffany B.- 1960 EZ Camper & 1960 Beetle
