There  are some dizzys that when installed will have the number one position
at approx 2 o'clock. Just set it up that way. You do not need to move the
dixxy drive.

ps. there should be a scrib mark in the dizzy at the 2 o'clock position
which would be number 1`

I checked the distributor drive and its "correctly" positioned 
(according to the bently) when the engine is at top dead center- its 
side-to-side and the slot is more toward the rear of the car.  Some 
better questions:

Should the radial mark on the distributor casing (that line) always be 
pointed more toward the back of the bus? (it was on the 009)
Is there more than one type of dizzy clamp- mine has the bolt on the 
right hand side of the dizzy?
Can the rotor position be changed relative to the protruding slot in on 
the bottom of the shaft?

Thanks again,
