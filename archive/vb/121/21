Scam.

Why?

1. It came via email.
2. It says in a few weeks, I've seen this email for months.
3. It says you can respond to the email with REMOVE in the subject line,

Anything received via email should be immediately doubted - don't delete

run attachments, don't email people to tell them they are infected with
a virus, and never respond to spam, especially when it says "click here
to remove yourself from our list".
