Well, basically, nothing.! ( Nothing good, that is :).
You will have to rebuild / replace that rod for sure, and the crank
will be turned or replaced, along with the oil cooler
and any other damaged parts ( hence, the Muir, and
the reference to some assembly required ).
Those pieces will be discovered all over the oil circuit,
you will need new main bearings, etc.
You are looking at the engine rebuilding process.
