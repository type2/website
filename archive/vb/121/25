Subject: Speaking of VW 

   Today I recieved a shippment of parts, in this shippment were new
flywheels and pushrods. The thing I thought was weird was that the flywheels
came from Italy in plan white packing and the pushrods came in a box that
looks like original VW logoed boxes, you know the blue boxes with vw print,
they even have the nerve to say original on the box in the same script as VW
uses!!!  These parts are supposedly genuine authorized VW replacement parts.

ps. For those that care brand new 200 mm 12 flywheels for 50 dollars each.
These have the removable ring gear for those that want to convert them to 6
volt
