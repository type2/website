I don't think I want my VW to be as reliable as a Harley!

I note that BMW still recommends ordinary motor oil for their air cooled
opposed twins.  Apparently there is no significant difference in the needs
of air and watercooled engines.

I note that my latest case of oil is now marked "SL" while the last case
was "SJ".  I guess they skipped K or it was around for a short time.
