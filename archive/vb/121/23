I missed the first post on this.

Someone on RAMVA got a letter from a company called "Continental"
asking for $XXXX for infringement.  They told them to go to hell.
Contintental cam back with "how about $X-$Y?"  At which point they
were told to go to hell again.  The third time they came back
with "make offer"
