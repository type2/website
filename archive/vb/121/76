Subject: Name these parts

I got some parts that I have no idea what they are for.  I have a bunch
but I figured I would start with these.  Some have part numbers showing
so if some has reference books with parts numbers I would appreciate any
insight.  So this is not a contest and I don't have any prizes...unless
you live close enough to come by and enjoy a beer or four.  TIA for any
help.  Follow the link below:
