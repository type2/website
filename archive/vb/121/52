Seems to me that testing a fluid's ability to conduct heat could be =
tested under controlled conditions. Pour a pint into an old pot on an =
electric range and call off temps and time. X seconds to raise the temp =
from 200f to 300f. Clean it out and pour in the next sample and plot it =
all out. Repeat a couple of times to prove results can be reproduced. =
Shorter times are better but the the temp decline might be interesting =
too. Anybody got a lot of different oils to test?
