Oil heated up by the heads doesn't provide as much heat back to the case as
you would think.  Realize that the combustion is not just taking place
against the head, but on the other side, you have an aluminum piston, which
is taking a lot of heat, but, unlike the head, there is no cooling fins, or
a cool intake charge, on the piston, so MUCH of it's heat is going through
the wrist pin, down the connecting rod, right to the crank, etc, etc....
And you have oil 'hurricaining'(sp?) around in the case, taking heat off
these items continually, with much more surface area with the oil that what
is offered in the heads.  When you're cruising down the road in your bus,
the crank whipping around creates an 'oil hurricane', and all that oil is
constantly moving across the hot metal parts taking a good portion of heat
with them.

I would LOVE to see some side by side results of an engine without, and
with, the combustion chamber and exhaust port of the head ceramic coated,
and the top of the piston ceramic coated, versus not coated.  I hear it's
the new thing being done with the HP engine's.  Anyone here seen results of
it?
