Hi Chuck&Jan,
Check out the parts manuals on the www.vintagebus.com website for those parts 
with part numbers on them.  As far as what you have images of:
The pushrods are for 20, 25 & 36 HP engine.
The TO bearing does not look like a ACVW part and having a ten number part 
number is not a VW part number.
Image five is MC rebuild pieces.
