What a load. 

You'd think these people at VWoA would be happy there are so many folks
who have nothing but positive intentions toward the VW brand.  If this
has already been asked, please forgive me, but I don't believe I've
heard of any other car-maker who is targeting enthusiasts in this way. 
Is Ford, for example, trying this with the vintage Thunderbird crowd? 
I'd be *really* surprised if they were.

Maybe someone should sue VWoA so these lawyers have something to do.  

Maybe VW is trying to make their legal department a revenue-center now?
