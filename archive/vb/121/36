I used Valvoline Synpower for my test. To give you an idea how syns compare
to dino oil, here is a test using Amsoil syn oil. Volvoline syn oil,
according to test specs, is very similar to Amsoil is composition.



                                      Amsoil Synthetic       Petroleum
                                      10W40 			   10W40

1. Effective lubrication range        -60 to +400 F          0 to +300F

2. Viscosity increase after                  9%                102 to 400%
   single-sequence (64 hour)
   Olds III-D Test

3. Wear (mg. weight loss, Falex test)       1.1mg               3 to 6 mg

4. Fluidity (-at-) -40F                       flows freely             solid

5. Volatility (evaporation (-at-) 300F             1%                   28%
   for 22 hrs)

6. Crankcase Temperature (Track Test)        240F                  290F

7. Flash Point (D92 test)                    470F                  400F

8. Oil consumption (50,000 mile test)     42% less than             -
                                          petroleum oils

9. Intake valve deposits (50,000 miles)    32.1 grams           75.5 grams

>From this data it is readily apparent that synthetic lubricants have
substantially broadened the horizons of engine lubricant protection.
Simply by comparing the lubrication-temperature-range comparison, the
limits of petroleum lubricants become evident.  On both ends of the
relevant temperature spectrum, synthetics demonstrate conclusively the
ability to significantly extend the thermal regions in which the engine
is protected.  This has a special significance for those automotive
powerplants which normally work harder and produce higher internal and
lubricant temperatures.,..that is to say: high-performance engines,
smaller high-RPM engines, air-cooled engines, turbo-charged engines,
Diesels and rotaries.  Furthermore, climatic conditions in which
synthetics allow operation with full engine protection are for all
practical purposes boundless, whereas with a petroleum oil the
protective capacity significantly diminishes with temperature extremes.
Note particularly the comparative viscosity (oil thickening) increases
after the 64-hour Olds III-D test (item 2)...9% for the Amsoil synthetic
vs 102-400% for the multigrade petroleum oils; the reduced wear (item
3); and the reduction in crankcase temperatures (item 6).  These
favorable results are quite typical of virtually all similar test
comparisons between petroleum- and synthetic-based motor oils.
