Subject: Re: [VB] Synthetic Oil Test 

I've been doing the synthetic jive for a few years now.  Being manager of a
Jiffy Lube, I helped myself to every flavor of oil to see what differences
it made a few years ago (10/30, 5/30, 10/40, 20/50, 15/40, 30, 40, in all
different brands).  Now I know what Berg says, the synthetic oil runs
cooler, because it is not taking the heat away from the heads.  So with
synthetic, heads run hotter, and oil runs cooler.  Sad to say, but this
portion of Berg's info is sorely outdated (or didn't check head temp, and
just made the assumption).

All conventional oils made my temps the same.  325 on the head, and 210-220
on the oil.  Tried synthetic oil (Quaker State 5w-50), and my oil temp
dropped 20 degrees.  Head temp stayed the same, wasn't even phased..  These
numbers are what I got driving the highway (at highway speeds) in the
summertime here in Las Vegas, when we were well over the 100 degree mark.

My personal opinion is, that the oil doesn't cool down the heads as much as
they say.  If you think about it, what is done for the heat transfer from
the head to the oil?  Whatever is under the valve cover.  Last time I
checked, there's no additional surface area (fins or the like) cast into
them to help with the transfer.  Sure, we obviously need oil in there, but
not the big deal like we're lead to believe.  But, like I say, that's just
my opinion.

One thing I found going with the synthetic 5/50, is it offers superior
performance over an oil such as a 20/50.   When the engine is cold, that
20/50 is going to take a lot longer to get pumping thatn the 5/50, and both
are the same at operating temperature.  You NEED to get that oil flowing
asap at startup.  But, if it's 110 degree's outside, then it probably wont
make a whole lot of difference.

Also, something that I've found while looking at my head temp gauge and oil
temp gauge, is although the two temps are related somewhat, the load on the
engine affects the head temp more, and the higher the rpm affects the oil
temp more.  Just what i've found, your results may vary.  :-)

Anyway, "Synthetic. It's what's for dinner."

  Hi all,
 If synthetic oil 'did not' have the heat carrying properties of dino oil,
wouldn't the results be just like Hart's?  The oil temps would show a
'lower' number because the cylinder head heat is not being removed
by the oil, dipstick would feel cooler also.  What we need is to have a
cylinder head temp gauge and do a test first with dino in there and
then with synthetic and see if in fact what the "head" temps are doing.
 Just my thoughts and my thoughts alone.
