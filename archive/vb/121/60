Subject: Re: [VB] What is the toughest climb you ever drove?

There's a pass over the Sierras near Yosemite that has a 26% grade.   That 
was the steepest.  The old 59 with split case gearing took us (me and two 
friends and camping gear) over it like a champ.  Did Independence Pass in 
Colorado in the same bus.  That was fun.   Have taken a number of buses over 
the Siskiyoos (Cal -Oregon border I-5) so thats no big deal, except in the 
middle of winter.   Hwy 9 over the Santa Cruz mountain is a good one- real 
windy.  Take it all the way to Santa Cruz from Saratoga or vice versa for a 
nice Sunday drive.  There are some good drives around there, Go from Felton 
up to Empire Grade- that'll give the bus a workout.  Hwy 17 in heavy rain 
where you can't see 50 ft and a car is spinning on the road in front of me 
and dodging through the spin like a do si do dance narrowly avoiding a 
collision was the hairiest.

Going 250 miles from E Wa to Oly with the front 3rd of a bus strapped to the 
roof rack (top heavy) and the inside piled with metal and camping stuff in my 
65 westy the worst climb was the ten miles up from the Columbia River in 100 
degree weather at 9am with the distributor not advancing (I set it to 
permanent advance for the trip) in 2nd gear.

There are some fun 'roads' in Capitol forest near Oly.

 I came up with:
 
 East out of Salt Lake City, heading to Cheyenne, Wyoming.
 
 North out of Bishop California. I think I was heading for Lake Isabella.
 
 Reno, Nevada to Grass Valley, California.
 
 I-5 at the Cal- Oregon border (honorable mention, not too bad)
