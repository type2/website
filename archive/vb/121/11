Subject: Seat upolstery was Re: [VB] FS - Costco Shed

So, what you're saying is that when new, it cost about

$175, but for just replacement panels its $200?  Are 
you paying someone $25 to take it away? LOL!!  Put it 
up on ebay, you might actually be able to sell it.

On a bus related topic, what is the material 
underneath the seats in between the horsehair padding 
and the springs?  Also, when reupolstering, should 
I go with OEM-style horsehair padding or something 
more modern?

Thanks,
Paul
