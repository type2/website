Subject: Re: [VB] Steering box-Help--??

Bessie can find an excellent steering box at Bus Boys 
(http://www/bus-boys.com) or 530-244-1616.  I've got one of their rebuilds 
in my 66, Katie, and it works great!

While you are there, might want to pick up a new drag link and swing 
lever/swing lever install kit, too.  These tend to also need to be replaced 
around the same time a steering box does.  If in doubt, crawl underneath 
Bessie and give these a good tug and push.  If they have play, replace them.

Good luck,
Richard

Bessie our 1967 Bus is in need of a steering box--any ideas as to where to
get one. Being a rebuilt I want to be sure its OK--

I had thought that I had already replaced Everything? -- from,
brakes-tires-shocks-wiring harness-motor--tranny--
RGB-,glass,battery,generator-carb-dizzy-locks,bumpers-all the rubber--etc.,
ect., --I guess if its on an Old Bus it will have to be replaced again--
hopefully, TWWM, uj
