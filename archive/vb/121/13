a

special

to

(very

be

the

to

up!

him.
> So we picked him after 10:00pm in my bus and drove downtown to tow his

of

the

> Before I even got the chain hooked up, the bumper fell off in my hands on

> We went home, 4 grown adults pile out of the bus and into the bug and off
we

without

no

> Walmart, Kevin bought his battery, we came back, hooked it up, and car
fired

original
