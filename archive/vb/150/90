If you increase displacement and power, you also increase cooling needs.
There is a good reason that VW redesigned the type 1 engine after it maxed
out at 1600cc.  Some have built large displacement engines that last, but
it takes money and expertise to do so.  Once you're done, it takes a lot
of expertise to keep that highly tuned engine in good repair, as all the
margin for error has been used up.

If you need more power, a late model bay bus might meet your needs better.
you can go up to 2000cc with stock reliability.
