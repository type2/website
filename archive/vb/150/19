No no Dave, Jeeves is the butler guy in the movies. I said to ask the people that sell the paint he
is going to buy. You see, the people that sell the paint talk to body shop guys that use this paint
all the time. Those guys already know what "non-spec" materials can used and which ones can't . See,
isn't isn't a lot better than waiting 5 years to see if you have a problem?

Besides, after 5 years it will be impossible to determine if the paint has crapped-out because of
incompatible reducer or because it was sprayed with acrylic enamel by a novice painter.

Beter luck with " just ask Jeeves " for compatibility regarding mismatched product.
Nobody with integrity will tell you to do that. The use of a non-spec primer with
mismatched reducer is an unknown at best.
The alternative is to apply the unknown material and make three wishes.
As for applying topcoat over old material, your supplier will suggest an array
of sealers, both to secure the substrate, and to provide a secure base for the color.
Then wait five years for the problems to surface.( delamination, color fade, etc. )
The PPG website includes a paint defects chart.
