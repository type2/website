Subject: Fitting a bay bus middle seat


Hello all

In my 67 std walk-through bus, I do not have a middle seat.  It seems very
hard to find a 2/3 seat, at least one I can afford.  It seems like alot of
people put in a Bay middle seat, but when I tried to fit one during a swap
meet, the mounts on the floor do not meet the brackets on the seat.  Is
there the particular year of a bay window bus I need to be looking for?

Or are their special brackets that are used when using a bay window seat?

As always
any help would be appreciated

thanks a lot

Bob
