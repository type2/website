The diagram is for a later bus, but check out

for ideas.  It looks like the box was hooked into the regular horn
circuit, as well as having a switch to make its own two horns go.
It also fed the light on top, maybe making it blink.

I would suggest using small fuses (5 amp blade style) in all the wires
from the box to the power source (battery) until you're sure you've
got it hooked up right.

Good luck!
