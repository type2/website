Subject: Re: [VB] Pulling RGB bearings

Tap the bearing back in, take a peice of emery cloth and clean-up the axle shaft and take a long
punch and lightly tap the bearing until it comes off. These bearings are not a press fit and it
shouldn't take much force to get them off.

I taken-off them off this way many times without damaging the bearing. Although chances are, if you
have metal frags in the tranny oil, your RG bearings will be damaged to some degree.

The Bentley has these very nice pullers shown in the book... But of course
those are not available to normal folks.  So what do you all use to pull out
the ball bearings?

The tranny is serious toast with metal frags falling out the oil drain :(
But the RGB bearings look perfect (need closer inspection of course) and I
would hopefully like to reuse them if possible..?  Maybe the bearing puller
destroys them for all I know.
