Subject: Im back...but with some new toys

Hello everyone...Im back on the list after being cut off many months back 
because of my email filling up. I was getting into my Studebakers, so I just 
stayed off.

However, my buddy just picked up a 63 crewcab and is in need of some parts, 
including (cough) VIN/Mcode tags and title if possible. VIN tags with 
bill-of-sale will work too.  Lets just say he got SCREWED.

I myself have just picked up another 61 single cab and a 68 single (which 
might be up for grabs).

Anyways, its good to be back on the VB list and I hope I can find the parts 
my buddy needs for his 63 Crew (hint hint). Im also on the lookout for a 
crewcab, even if its a baywindow. I have another friend thats looking for 
the a treasure chest door for his 64(?) single cab.

Did all single cabs have two treasure chest doors ?
