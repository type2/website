Subject:  [VB] Free walkthough section in Northern Cali AGAIN

Well I gave the last guy a year anyone else interested. Must pick up I am
NOT going to SAC BOR with a truck. From a early 64 no front floor and no
cargo area hacked off with sawzall ! I think I can send pictures (  I got a
digital camera last week) As soon as I cut it into pieces and take to the
dump I'll find someone who needs one.If this list doesn't work I'll try the
samba( T. Mink and '59 floor pan .. good idea)    Lloyd in Eureka, Calif
