Years ago (5) there was this great black square sticker with white type
which read "Never Get Behind A VW Bus." I loved that one. It was on my
previous splittie, "Alias," which after 19 years was pretty much vaporized
by a red-lighter.

That was 1997. The splittie I drive these days, "Grief," with tremendous
thanks to this list over the years, after five years of coaxing the shy
thing it's finally morphing into the operational reliability that was Alias'
and, along with a new paint scheme, I'm trying to find a respectable sticker
with which to christen its (stubbornly reluctant) coming of age.

Alas, "Never Get Behind A VW Bus" is now nowhere to be found. I've tried old
links but they're all dead. Even Google got me zilch. "Funkengroovin'," the
store from which I ordered the original for Alias, seems to have
disappeared.

And now I've a VW Bus ex-basketcase, once headed for Bus Heaven and now a
daily driver, in need of a little chutzpah. Or moxie.

Has anyone here seen this sticker or know if it's still available somewhere?

Thanks.

Craig
