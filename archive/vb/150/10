Beter luck with " just ask Jeeves " for compatibility regarding mismatched product.
Nobody with integrity will tell you to do that. The use of a non-spec primer with
mismatched reducer is an unknown at best.
The alternative is to apply the unknown material and make three wishes.
As for applying topcoat over old material, your supplier will suggest an array
of sealers, both to secure the substrate, and to provide a secure base for the color.
Then wait five years for the problems to surface.( delamination, color fade, etc. )
The PPG website includes a paint defects chart.
