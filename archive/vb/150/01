Yes, this I realize and thank you, but that wasn't the solution for which I,
... um... err. .. longed.

I can and I will do so, of course -- make my own if I have to. But it was
just a gentle reference to something,

I was just looking for the same sticker.

Thus, I shall make it myself, as, alas, I am left adrift in a world of repo.
<I love typing in melodrama, don't you?>

And let them quiver in the sight of my art.

Pause.

Pause.

Incomprehension.

(Damn... didn't really want 'em to quiver.. must they shake so? They don't
have the sticker. Oh, damn them. Damn them all, then.)
