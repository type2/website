As far as I know, that's correct.  I think the retard only happens at
or near idle as a smog-control function.  The advance happens
throughout the RPM/load range and is, I think, the main thing you are
after when you go to a vacuum advance distributor.

I thought you could only put a Pertronix in an 009?  Don't know for
sure.  You might look at both kinds of distributors to see what kind
of room you have - it seems to me like the dual advance with two
rods coming from two vacuum cans would have less room to install a
Pertronix, which is a little bigger than a set of points.
