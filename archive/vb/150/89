Subject: Re: [VB] Dual vs single vacuum advance

I put a Pertronix on my T3 which has a single advance (plus a set of centrifugal weights). It looks
just like a T1/T2 vacuum advance where the points are mounted. I had to do a little engineering, but
they went in pretty easy. BTW, I love this setup, never have to set or replace points and I've had
the Pertronix in for over 3 years.

I thought you could only put a Pertronix in an 009?  Don't know for
sure.  You might look at both kinds of distributors to see what kind
of room you have - it seems to me like the dual advance with two
rods coming from two vacuum cans would have less room to install a
Pertronix, which is a little bigger than a set of points.
