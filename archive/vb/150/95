For a good hill climber I would go counterweighted 72mm stroke and 88mm or
90.5mm with 041 heads and a E-100/110 cam. The stroke will give you the
torque, the cam will keep your the duration in line with your power
requirements and a center mount 32/36 progressive will give you the low and
upper ends for that displacement. If I was you I would keep a vac
distributor on it so that the advance and retard is smooth and even. I would
make it a dog house oil cooler and possibly add a slim line sump and 30mm
oil pump.

	Since everyone has been talking about engines lately what would
be a good size engine for a bus that needs to climb hills back and forth
from work each day. I have a 50 mile trip each day and my 1600dp doesn't
cut it with the grade and other hills I need to climb. I was thinking
something like a 1776 or 1914 dual port engine with a pict 34 or baby
dell's. Also who would be a good engine builder?


Thanks for your time
