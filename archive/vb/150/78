Hi Tom,
The strongest and best place for the jack and especially the jack stands is 
under the torsion bar tubes!  Anywhere else will bend up if you have a heavy 
load in/on your bus and/or any rusted sheet metal.  Of course make sure to 
block the wheels of the axle you are not jacking up at the time.
