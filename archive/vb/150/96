Pete, I don't blame you for being bummed, but all this
tells me is that I want to do all my engine work
myself.  Then I have no one to blame but me.  I built
my 1776 and have had to pull it 4 times since, but
isn't that why it's a hobby???  I think I finally got
it right, but what's more satisfying than that?

PS If you want it done right the first time, pay the
big bucks, and get a written guarantee from a
REPUTABLE shop.
