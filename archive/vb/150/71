Subject: Need imput about engine

Hi List,
My engine had been acting funky, so I took it back to
the guy that built it. He ended up pulling the engine
and proceeded to tear it down. He called and said a
main bearing (front of engine, #1) had welded itself
to the case (i think) and that it was his opinion that
the engine had been ran without oil at one time or
another. The engine only has about 5,000 miles on it
and I assured him it had never been ran without oil. I
have personally changed the oil myself and have never
started it without putting oil in first. He said he
had built plenty of engines and that's what it looks
like to him. My question is this: Is there some other
scenario that could explain why this particular part
of the engine might not have been oiling properly or
as to how this bearing got like this? I service my
vehicles regularly, I don't hot rod or abuse my
vehicles in any way. Would like to hear from you guys
about this. It's a 1776 with dual 34 Webers,
counterweight crank, stock cam, full flow oil, deep
sump. Could this have been something he did wrong when
building the engine? The engine never did feel really
balanced ever since I got it back. Always kinda shook
the truck, which I found odd since it was supposed to
be balanced and with the counter weight crank and all.
Please respond and let me know what yall think.

Bumned in Oklahoma,
3DPete
