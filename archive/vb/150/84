First break loose lugs and axle nuts (don't take them off, just break them=20
loose).

to do the front I set the parking brake.  If your parking brake is iffy,=20
block in front of and behind the back wheels.   Jack it up under the middle=20
of the front torsion tubes- put a piece of wood (like a short piece of 2x4)=20
on the jack and it goes right behind the swing lever.   Put the jack stands=20
at each end of the beam so they don't obstruct the zerk fittings.  You can d=
o=20
both fronts this way.  Grease the suspension while it's in the air- includin=
g=20
the spindles- 4 zerks on each steering knuckle- and the swing lever in the=20
middle-zerk faces the front- till clean grease comes out.

To do the rears I block both in front and behind the front wheels.  put 2x4=20
under the U shaped piece of metal under the tranny.  use jack stand under th=
e=20
rear torsion tube.

Old flex hoses cause bad braking, do replace them if they are old.  They can=

collapse inside even if they don't have cracks or tumours on the outside, an=
d=20
the fluid does not then go back to the reservoir but is trapped the wheel=20
side of the hose causing that brake to drag.   the way I check them is to=20
bleed the brakes.   If a nice heathy stream of fluid comes out, they are=20
good, if wimpy or none, they are bad.  If there are any cracks on the outsid=
e=20
they are bad.  Any tumours- don't even drive it.  Get a line wrench (11mm) t=
o=20
undo the metal ends- vise grips or open end wrenches can round the metal=20
nuts. =20

When you have the drums off- peel back the edge of the wheel cylinder dust=20
cover- it should be dry under there.  If not- its bad even if the fluid=20
hasn't gotten onto the shoes yet.  Each adjusting star has a metal tang that=

keeps it from unadjusting- check to make sure they are all there.   Take the=

stars and shoe holders (things that thread intyo the stars that go onto the=20
shoes) off and clean and grease the threads and where the stars go into the=20
star holder on the brake backing plate so they are easy to adjust in the=20
future.  Stuck stars are a PITA.

 Hey everyone,
=20
 I am new to the list, and love to follow the trials and tribulations of
 fellow members. Now,  I need some help, I have a standard 67=B9 that I
 purchased about three months ago. When drove it for the first time and
 applied the brakes it pulled heavily to one side. I knew then that it need
 brake work. I have looked at the  whole system the best that I can, and now
 need to jack it up and check the wheels. I have a floor jack and stands, bu=
t
 do not know the proper way to use (where to place jack?) them with an old
 bus. I don=B9t want to make a stupid mistake that will cause damage to my n=
ew
 ride. Thanks for the help!
