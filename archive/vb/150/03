Go easy Matt. When you give this guy practical advise, he starts writing all kind of crazy stuff.

I would suggest that you use your favorite word processing, spreadsheet,
or presentation program to come up with a full-scale reproduction of
whatever sticker you want.  Print out a copy and save a copy to disk,
then take both copies to your local Kinko's, quick-signs place, etc.
They should be able to print it on self-adhesive vinyl.
