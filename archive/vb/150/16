  Westley's White, available at Wally World, K-Farts and about any auto
parts store, the best thing out there, has been around longer then me, works
great, especially on visors, originally from England, but now mainstream

Hello,

Any ideas on how to clean a pin hole headlining?  A friend has just bought a
66 bus and the headlining is still tight, but has yellowish stains in
places.  We tried cleaning it with CIF but that didn't touch it
unfortunately. 

Cheers
Paul
