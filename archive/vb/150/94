Hi Clara,
We used to use that area.  Then we noticed we were flatting it out which 
would weaken it.  Before that we even used the sump plate of the engine to do 
the same and finally tore up the rear tranny rubber mounts.  Since then we 
use only the torsion bar tubes for jacking our VWs with no problems.
