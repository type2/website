Sounds like home boy forgot to put in the bearing dowel to keep it from
spinning in the journal.  There is a possibility that the dowel "rolled" and
buried in the magnesium case, but that is odd for the #1 bearing journal to
do that (common on #2).  

Maybe he did not set the endplay right, way too tight, and burned the shims
to the crank/bearing?  I doubt this is the problem though.

Also if you are able to check out the crank main journals.  If they are
scorched and show bluing in the metal then it is likely there is an oil
control/pressure/supply issue... Or just plain serious overheating.
Especially look at the #1 main bearing journal on the crank, if it is not
blue then he clearly missed the bearing dowel...  If the #1 is fried then it
is oil problems.  This could be a case of "unclean" shop, where a bit of
dirt (or RTV glob) got in the crank oils passages and gummed them up and
caused oil starvation at the wear surfaces.

It sounds like the shop screwed up the motor one way or another.  Even if
you overheat the motor it will not die at #1 journal anyway.


Good Luck,
