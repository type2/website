Subject: Re: [VB] Cleaning headlining

There is also a product in the US called Castrol Super Clean, a
cleaner/degreaser available through auto parts stores.  Used
full-strength on a vinyl headliner, it gets out stains very well. 
However, left on too long it will damage the plastic--about 10-15
seconds is plenty, then scrub and rinse with lots of water and damp
sponges.  Worked like a charm on our Beetle convertible.
