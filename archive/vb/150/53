Sounds like a UNI-VENT to me...
I have one on my Single Cab, and another in my '55 Panel. They work alot better
than the ambulance fans at actually cooling off the passengers. My daughter
refers to mine as the A/C.

I've seen them for sale from $10 all the way up to $375 for an NOS one a guy in
Fresno has. that's a bit ridiculous though. Personally I've never paid more than
$20 for one............
