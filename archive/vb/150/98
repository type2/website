2 days ago I was towing a bus out to the barn (still get to use the 
barn and shop on the property 'til it sells). Was using my '88 
Suburban pulling a ''69 bus with a tow rope and had no help. I got 
out of the Suburban to go turn the steering wheel on the bus and 
guess I left the Suburban in gear. When I straightened out the wheel 
on the bus it let the pressure off things and the Suburban took off 
pulling the bus with it. Good thing I was in a big field. I'm sure it 
looked funny with me chasing to catch up with the suburban pulling 
the bus so I could jump in the front and stop the whole thing.

Just like a Tom Cruise movie...only with a fat guy and old junker 
cars, and a trashy west texas field. I guess it really isn't like a 
Tom Cruise movie after all. Ah well....
