Be careful if you are using home insulation on a bus. 
I have a remarkably rust free midwest bus that I am
restoring.  The only major rust was in the doors and
it was caused by moisture held in by the pink
fiberglass insulation.  Any insulation should be
attached to the inner door panels and not the metal. 
I know that you are interested mainly in the ceiling
panels but I thought that I should give you a word of
warning anyhow.  INSULATION BREEDS RUST!
