Subject: happy trails

hey all. time for me to sign off for a while. an upcoming computer repair,
the need to fix rachel's bugs, the need to pull my entire rear
suspension/tranny out of my bus for leakage fixing-cleaning-spring plate
resetting, jerome, and a 3 week trip to albuquerque would only fill up my
mailbox, and probably get me kicked off anyway.
so, until next time...drive 'em daily
