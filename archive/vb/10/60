Subject: RE: [VB] Sideloader

I saw that this morning since I'd really like to find a bd sc or a tipper...
I figured it was either a function of not enough coffee and my brain was
teasing or it had been cut and the description just didn't mention it... u'd
expect it to say 'side loader' if it were.

Anyone else know anything about this thing????
