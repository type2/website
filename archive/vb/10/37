Subject: Re: [VB] My new find

Yep, I know who owned it.  Me.  It is a '66 by the way and was always a
Midwest bus.  Jerry G. never saw it let alone owned it.  Also I don't
believe the miles are original either.  I actually owned it twice.  I owned
it, sold it to George Brett of the KC Royals then bought it back from him a
few years later then ended up selling it to the Discover Card people.
Around the KC area it is also known as the Brett Bus.  It is/was a very nice
bus then they airbrushed the hell out of it.  Oh well.  Where can I find
current information on it?
