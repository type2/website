Hey all, Binz disassembly started yesterday.  Plan is to have the Binz =
painted by the time Bulli Brigade rolls around in early November.  I am =
having John Jones of Barndoor, double door, sunroof, walkthrough, =
lowered, air bagged, panel fame/infamy do the paint and body work.  He =
does fantastic work.  It will be his first "stock" paint job.  Have a =
small list of things I need ...of which I am sure there will be more.

1)  The little metal tab coming out of the dog leg where the end of the =
front bumper attaches.  Need both sides.
2)  Radio hole cutout.  I think '55 - '66 will work.
3)  Front part of the shift rod, apparently mine is worn and that is why =
it pops out occasionally.  I think '59 and earlier will work.

If you have any parts busses around you are willing to cut these parts =
off of and ship please contact me ASAP.

Thanks,
Dan
