There is a bunch of cool stuff in OZ for sale, I know of a few 1 offs
(coachbuilts) for sale and also a Bestlewagon? (like Charlie Hammils) for
2000 dollars U S plus shipping $1500.00 dollars. Not counting all the OG
Safari's, Roo Bars, driving lights, etc.. I have a guy from there sending me
a set of OZ panel louvers and the inside air box, you know the 2 foot long
up high only louvers and the interior air box that directs the air to the
engine, SUPER COOLING
