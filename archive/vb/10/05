Subject: SANDING paint

ok my vw was painted over somtime in the 70's and i
would like to sand it down to the original paint. ive
seen this done and i like the look of it. does anybody
out there know what grit to use on it?  i was thinking
that you would start off with a rougher grit and
gradualy work down to a fine grit? any info is much
appreciated
       thanks     
                phil
