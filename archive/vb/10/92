This really should NOT have been directed to the list....but for the
moment I'm a wee bit forgiving since the command have changed.

So, on that note. Attention everyone.

To change from the normal per-message mode of a list to the digest mode,
you do this:

send a blank email to

type2-unsubscribe(-at-)type2.com
or
vintagebus-unsubscribe(-at-)type2.com

reply to the request confirmation you will recieve.

Now,

send another blank email to

type2-digest(-at-)type2.com
or
vintagebus-digest(-at-)type2.com

and again reply to the confirmation.


and there you have it.

Of course, DO send the message from the address you subscribed from in
the first place.  If you cannot, then send a message stating as much to
type2-owner(-at-)type2.com or type2-admin(-at-)type2.com or
vintagebus-owner(-at-)type2.com or vintagebus-admin(-at-)type2.com and await human
assistance.

DO be patient because we dont get paid to do this and sometimes replies
take longer then you may wish to wait. Sorry in advance.

And if you cant read the trailer attached to each and every message and
digest you receive to learn how to unsubscribe completely, we have no
mercy. Illiterate people need not be on an email mailing list.
