Just a note on the various paint / rust / POR-15 threads...

Pages 15 and 16 of Seume's "VW Bus" book shows how Buses were
originally painted.  After welding the whole bodyshell was dipped
in something to clean it (I'd guess a mild acid) and then dipped
in a "phosphate solution" for anti-oxidizing.  I don't know if
this was meant to be a long-term thing or just something to keep
the rust off until it got painted, but I thought it might be
interesting to know.
