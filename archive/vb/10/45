Subject: attachments

Hey all.... what's with all the attachments coming through???

I see them on emails from:

Jim Ellis
Zengrin57
Paul Leske
Thomas Boyd


I never open the emails all the way and only preview them so I don't even
know the attachment names... and I NEVER open email attachments unless I
know what they are.
