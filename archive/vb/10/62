Subject: More Brake Questions

Here is a picture of the brake cylinder I picked up today.  The part #s
referenced in the picture are for left and right:

As the caption states, doesn't the new one have kind of a funky angle to
it?

Second question concerns the following picture:

Obviously the parts store sold me the wrong shoes but they swore, even
after I said "I think these are kinda small" that these are correct for
a 63 type two.  Are they?  Do I have the funky bigass drums that are
cool but hard to find parts for?

I have given up hope for getting this back on the road tonight.  But I
would still like any thoughts on getting this fixed as soon as possible.
I have a co-worker who has been very kind in picking me up in the
morning and I'm afraid of wearing out her generosity.  Thanks for all
ya'lls help.
