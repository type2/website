Someone mentioned that the list in question is the
Vintagebus list not the VintageVW list. My response
was, "Oh yeah, you are correct."

More rules:
- simple hyphenated words count as one if found in a
common dictionary. Most hyphenated words can usually
be substituted with a synonym. When doubtful use
another word.
- several words slammed together without spaces do not
count as one.

Prize is for the most creative, thought provoking,
provocative (in the vw flame bait sense), the most
accurately telling of the current vw scene and or
humorous. Don't be flat out mean or libelously nasty.
It's not an opportunity to cap on individuals. Go for
concepts not people.

If a five word message creates a sensation and
generates the most responses then that will be in it's
favor.

Judges are allowed to play but will not win the actual
top prize. I will owe them a beer or NA beer depending
on the person. Hopefully they will remain anonymous as
to their judgeship status. This way they may add to
the creativity/madness.

Most Judges have been selected already.
