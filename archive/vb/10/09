Amen to that! That was the genesis of the Zebra paint job on the now soon
to be gone Zebra bus. Each stripe was strategically placed to hide dents,
dings and rust. And...since I used Rustoleum (brush on, no less) it helped
to preserve this unique beast.

Of course, if it lived in a desert climate it would do so much better...
