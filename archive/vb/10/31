I have used POR 15 lots of times with great success.
The key seems to be moisture in the air.  The part
will absorb it, if it is there.  If you are in a dry
spell you really dont need to worry about it. I live
in Oregon and it doesnt get much wetter. I just wait
to paint until it has been in the 80's for 2-3 days.
Have never had a problem.  I also gave up sandblasting
as much as possible.  The POR 15 metal ready works
great.  Just like other painting, 80% is in the prep. 
I clean it, clean it again, and then go over it a
third time.

Enjoy your day!
