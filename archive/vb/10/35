the offset is different.  

Somehow I created this wierd set up in my westy that takes a small 6V gen 
pulley, and a small belt - fun to figure out which size belt you need when 
you don't know.  If I use a regular pulley on it the offset is wrong and the 
pulleys dont line up striaght which is a belt eating setup.  If I use a 38A 
pulley on it is the offset is right,  and I use the regular size belt.  This 
will be interesting for an easy swap to see how using a smaller gen pulley 
affects the cooling.   But now the voltage regulator is dead.
