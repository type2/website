Subject: Residual moisture...Por 15?

Hi All    I got this from the Por 15 site...Like I
said I never used the stuff but it sounds good and
there is this posted on their site.....Residual
Moisture...         Scene 1
A rusted control arm or coil spring or push rod rests
on a table in your garage. The part's been there for
months waiting to be restored. You intend to sandblast
it and paint it with two coats of POR-15® Clear Rust
Preventive Paint. You want the look of bare, clean
metal through the glossy coating. You are an
experienced restorer. 
Scene 2
Your buddy has sandblasting equipment. You blast your
control arm or springs or whatever, wrap it in
newspaper or brown kraft paper and take it back to
your garage, making sure you don't touch it with your
bare hands. The weather is sunny, or overcast, or
rainy, or you choose it. 
You open your can of POR-15 Clear and lay down a thin,
covering coat. The part looks gorgeous. Four hours
later, or the next morning, you put down your second
coat. Looks great. 
Scene 3
A week later or two weeks later you examine the part
and see a rust-colored spot or two under the coating,
which still looks otherwise perfect. What's going on
here? This stuff is supposed to stop rust. Have I done
something wrong? 
Here's What Happened
Now let's go back to the beginning where the rusty
control arm is resting on your bench. It's been
indoors for months, so it must be dry, right? WRONG!!
Ordinary steel is very porous. That control arm has
thousands or millions of microscopic cavities in it
that are filled with moisture. Even after
sandblasting, thousands of moisture pockets remain.
The piece may look dry, but it isn't... and if you let
it sit in your garage after blasting for a few hours
before you paint it or worse, overnight, more moisture
settles in to haunt you later. POR-15 is hydrophilic
(moisture-seeking). The first coat 'pulled' that
residual moisture to the surface and sealed it in, as
did the second coat. Microscopic corrosion then
occurred under the coating and became visible to the
naked eye. The POR-15 coating did not break because
it's flexible and very tough, but if enough moisture
remains under the coating and the corrosion continues
for a while, that may occur in the future. 
Get The Moisture Out First
After you've prepared your part for painting (by
sandblasting, metal-prepping. etc.), use a warm air
blower to make sure the piece is bone-dry, then paint
it at once. Apply your second coat or POR-15 when the
first coat is just dry to the touch with slight
finger-drag remaining. And never forget the three most
important rules of painting:
1. Preparation       2. Preparation       3.
Preparation      
   Like I said never worked with the stuff...just
reading the words on their site........rust is a mean
little mother!   Maybe POR 15 everything then hook up
one of those electric anti rust systems.
