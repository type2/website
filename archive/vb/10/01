Subject: crusty buses

I dont how rust adds character.  The goal should be to
keep our old buses running forever and to do this you
need to keep the body nice.   There are sometimes fun
stop-gap measures though that you need to do until you
either get the time or cash to do it right.  I only
view these as temporary measures.

One day I got a wild hair up my ass and bought a bunch
of camouflage spray paint at Wal-Mart and painted my
entire '55 Pritschenwagen with it.  It turned out
well, hid the rust and will help preserve it a bit
until I can either retore it or sell it.  Even my wife
admits that it looks better.  I sure believe that it
looks a lot more interesting than any pinko hippy
paintjob. It only cost me $40 to paint the whole bus
and an evening of dizzyness.
