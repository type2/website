Hey,

Does anyone have a source for the ceiling panels above the driver and
passenger seats?  If nothing else, I am looking to get the correct
dimensions for them(maybe a pattern?), so I can make them myself.

I am in the process of putting insulation up in the ceiling to guard against
the elements.  Right now to guard against the Florida heat, but I want to
insulate against colder climates.  I went to the Depot and picked up a roll
of pink panther insulation, and I have the rear sections all figured out.
The next challange will be the cab.

Any help appreciated! - Kevin
