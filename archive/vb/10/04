Subject: Trip to CA this past June

After my speedometer blew up on the way home from CA this past June I didn't
keep a good track of the mileage but it had to be close to 5800 miles if not
a few more
On dollars spent for gas I totaled $434.77
On gallons used 237.835.
For a average price per gallon of $1.83
Till the speedometer blew I averaged 22.475282 mpg
Pretty good for the weight that I had in my truck and the heat and altitude
that I drove over
Probably would of averaged 50 if I hadn't carried Erin <;^{)>

PS  Anybody got a real cheap working speedometer to fill the hole while I
get my original speedometer repaired.
At the OCTO show I won a Speedo rebuild so just want something to feel the
hole and work till the original is back
   IF it is a 66 that would be nice and even better a trip speedometer but
anything will work if the price is right
