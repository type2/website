Hi, I didnt look at your pics, but you mentioned a 63 bus?   Perhaps they 
sold you 63 parts.  63s are generally considered to have the 55-63 3/4 ton 
style brakes.

...HOWEVER, if you have a one ton front axle, you used the one ton aka 64-67 
front brakes- which has slightly differnet cylinders and yes wider shoes. If 
you have this you have to ask for 64 brake parts.  in 63 it was an option to 
get a 1 ton, and also sometimes a PO has swapped the beam for a later one.
