Those are burned valves. They would be replaced if the heads were
rebuilt, so they aren't a big deal. You don't usually see so many valves
burned that bad on an engine. One usually drops by then.

Speaking of valves; I just got some 1600 sp heads rebuilt. When the guy
who did the work took the valves out, one of the exhaust valves broke in
his hand. Pretty good timing, huh?
