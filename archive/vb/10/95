Mostly I would tend to agree with this argument.  In the "High
Performance Modifications" chapter of later Idiot Books, it says
"Rest assured that VW designed the cooling system using the world's
best test equipment."  It also gives examples of Muir's '68 Bus
running hotter with the windows open and Colin Messer's (the author)
'57 Bug ran hotter with the sunroof open.  1957!  Slide rules and
pressure gauges and smoke guns and sticks with streamers on them!
No computers with flow modeling.  Hell, probably no computers at
all for the engineers, and even if they had one, it was less 
powerful than a programmable scientific calculator you can buy
today for $100.  But they got the cooling system so right that 50
years later, the recieved wisdom on VW cooling systems is that if
you go with the stock setup and OG or d*mn close parts, you'll do
great in nearly every case.  

I know that engines are not tires, but I'd like to think that the
suspension/steering/tires engineering was as good as the powertrain
engineering.

Some notes from the '63-'67 Bentley...  15 inch rims take 6.40-15
tube-type tires and are designated 4.5 K x 15 .  14 inch rims take
7.00-14 tubeless tires and are designated 5 JK x 14 .  Does anybody
know what the difference is between "K" and "JK" ?  I'm guessing
it has to do with the cross-section of the rim but I don't know.

Page B-11 4 says that "Tubeless radial ply tires are not suitable 
for the Volkswagen because there is no guarantee that they will
remain firmly seated on the rims when cornering fast."  They may
have changed their mind later as tires got better, but this is what
the '67 manual says.

There are 17 pages of stuff about tires (B-11, B-12, B-13).  Twelve
of them (more than two-thirds) have admonitions about the tire pressure.  
B-11 7 and 8 have a good rap on checking the tire pressure.

So anyway...there's some gasoline for the fire.
