Hey VW email motorsports fans!
Bored with Summer? Sick of my long emails? Well here's
a chance for change! Being the guru of excessively
long emails to the list I see it as totally
(in-)appropriate for me to suggest a new concept. But,
alas I will anyway.

How about a voluntary "The Five Word Friday Contest." 

Rules:
- Limit of five posts each containing ONLY five words-
Any language. (If the judges can't understand it then
your chances are minimized. Our ignorance is your
loss).
- Must relate to VW or this list within typical Friday
standards.
- Boil your thoughts down completely.
- MUST be five unique words. 
- Not less or more words.
- Not to exceed five words. 
- Not to exceed five posts.  
- One original post and four replies to other peoples.

- No fair stringing five messages to make one message.
- I will not post to the list on this Friday 
  (now THERE'S a change and the alternative prize!)

Save your thoughts for Friday.
*****
Wait until Friday! Anyone posting on this topic prior
to Friday is out of the contest. For this contest,
Friday is loosely defined by starting in Japan and
ending in Hawaii. Consideration given for me not being
a time zone expert.

Prize: 
A 1958 item encompassing stainless steel, the Porsche
and VW assembly lines, Foxcraft skirts, an 18.1045
second drag racing record and genuine Rusty
VanBondo-like customizing. It's enough to make
Splitzine* seem tame.

I will pick five judges to remain anonymous. Hopefully
they will help choose a winner/weiner to be announced
next week. I will ship the prize anywhere world wide.
Judges will not know what the prize is.

Bribery, pmail, cheating, cold beer and good natured
public backbiting encouraged. Totally voluntary.

Asking Paula about the idea she replied,
"Hey Jim, your idea sucks." 
Just for that she will get a prize of her own. It too
will go around the world. ;-)

Pmail if you want to help judge this fiasco.
I have no idea what will happen. 
Flop or funny who cares?
