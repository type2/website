Subject: looking for Overheating site

I am at my wits end.
There used to be a site that I bookmarked:
http://www.simplecom.net/dakhlia/bus-stuff/overheating.html
But it is no longer up. Anybody know where it went? I really need to rethink
the whole thing and I thought this was a good place to start.

At "Busses by the River" this weekend, we adjusted the carb and timing,
(thanks Mark!!) but still too hot on the way home, and very poor power.
-( I cannot enjoy the ride any longer, and that is very sad.
