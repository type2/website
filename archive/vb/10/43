>>Sounds to me like a fuel delivery problem, actually.

I really wonder if it is a fuel delivery problem.  When I could not get it 
started in the parking lot I did try starter fluid.  The bus did not even 
have an inclination of firing.  Just spun via the starter.  The starting 
fluid should have bypassed any carb/fuel issues and at least had it fire.  
Right?

Or am I completely nuts?
Mike
