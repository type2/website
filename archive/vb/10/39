Hi all, just another plug for FamilienFest 7. This is really a nice show.
It's on the grass and under trees! This year will be huge. Get more info
off the front page of our website http://www.sv2s.com/

Should we set up a listee meeting spot and time? We could plan to meet at
Ronnie's bus. What time?
