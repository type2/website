Subject: Re: [VB] SANDING paint to ORIGINAL paint

I wet sanded with I think 3-400 until the primer and weird ghost flames (yes 
ghost flames on primer) on top was thin enough to just barely see the 
original paint underneath.  Then i went down thru the grits until the 
original paint was nice and smooth and all the other crap was gone.  I think 
i went to 800 or somewhere around there.

I polished it afterwards to just see what would happen and it looked pretty 
good.  

It didnt end up perfect but does look nice on the areas that i did.
