 I quote directly from POR's website:

 WHAT IS THE BEST SURFACE ON WHICH TO PAINT POR-15?
 POR-15 likes rusted surfaces best. Seasoned metal and sandblasted metal are
 also good. POR-15 does not adhere well to smooth, shiny surfaces, but will
 adhere well to those surfaces with the proper preparation.

 So, whoever said POR doesn't work on rust doesn't know anything about the
 stuff.
