If you have absolutely ruled out bad connections, then it's probably
the coil or condenser.  My Dad had the condenser go bad on his '74
Bug right after he got it and nothing we did (including a brand new
coil) helped, until we changed the points and condenser.  This was
a hard failure that didn't depend on temperature.  However, electrolytic
capacitors/condensers (which I think is the kind most point-type
automotive ignition systems use) are notorious for failing at high
temperatures.

You can get just the condenser but it's better to change the points 
and condenser as a set.  Like Clara said, follow the "Engine stops
or won't start" procedure in the Idiot manual and you should find
it - there is a whole step about checking the distributor, points,
and condenser.

Good luck!
