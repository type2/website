Hi Joel,
Yes it would lean the mixture.  Causing that side to get alot hotter.  In 
turn causing the head chamber/s to crack and/or burn valve/s.  Check your 
compression and if really low in #2 compared to the others, then the head is 
suspect.

Since you have a bus and are not looking for drag racing RPMs, that is 
probably the best thing to do!

Pre-1967 bus and KG radio holes are the same size.  Bug is differant from 
1958 on.  So you have to make sure the radio fits a pre-1967 bus or KG!
