I'm in Brandon or "lil Macdill" as they call it.  We are just outside
Tampa on the eastside.  There are a few VWs out here but the real VW fun
is in Clearwater.  Good bunch of guys.  Wishing now I would have bought
a house out there.....yeah right, like I could have afforded it :-)

I will most likely be relocating to Tampa soon for
work, and am just wondering what the vintage vw scene
is like there.  Any list members with club or event
information please let me know.

Thanks in Advance
