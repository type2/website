Is this a camper?  Some of the campers had a hot wire coming off the 
battery or voltage regulator for the lights in the camper.  If the engine
compartment end heads for the battery or voltage regulator this might be
what it is.  

If it's not a camper I don't know.  If it's late enough to have back-up
lights or if it has had back-up lights added it might be part of the
wiring for those, but I thought that wiring went along with the main
harness on the right side of the engine. The only way to know for sure
is to follow it and find both ends.
