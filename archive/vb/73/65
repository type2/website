I agree with Sean, anytime you use thin wall cylinder on an engine you run
the risk of overheating and warping the cylinders. A slip in set of 87mm
cylinders are overbored 85.5mm cylinders. On a bug or a ghia I wouldn't have
an qualms using them, but On my truck or in a van it just lowers the life of
your engine. Not as bad as slip in 88mm, but a much lower life expectancy.
Use the bigger exaust, and be coooolllll.

A header and single quiet pack will get you another
3-4 HP and may aid in keeping the engine a little
cooler as they are less restrictive than a stock
muffler. I am not sure about the temp difference claim
but it would be good thing for a 1641cc if it's true!
