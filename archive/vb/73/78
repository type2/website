 Is a 1641cc considered small bore? That's news to me.
There is a good section on exhaust in the "How to Hot
Rod your VW" that recommends an equal length header
for a 1600cc. I also seem to remember HotVW's doing a
test a few years ago with the same results. I couldn't
tell you about the effects on a 36 or 25Hp motor.
