Subject: RE: [VB] What exaust should I use?

The problem with running a header on a small bore bus engine is the loss of
bottom end torque. We have tested that here is AZ, in 100 plus heat and
found that a stock muffler gives you better bottom end and have not seen any
difference in engine temps, touch the dipstick test.

ronnie; stock muff unless I'm running big engine stuff, working on a design
for a big bore stock looking muffler. Did those years ago on 356 Porsche's,
so I don't see why it can't be done on a bus.

What about a "Zoom Tube"? Would this clear the bumper ok?
