On a split the roof rolls straight into the rain gutter. On a bay the 
there is a 1/8" flat ledge before the downturn to the rain gutter. 
The rack for bays sit on that ledge and not in the gutter like split 
racks are supposed to.  Is the wood slat rack you have a Westfalia 
rack on a PIP repro?

Interesting
