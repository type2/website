Subject: Re: [VB] Difference in Engine Lid Lock 66/67

What it seems had happened, the latch on my decklid came from something else
(who knows what).   When I went to order one they showed 66 and 67 being
different numbers. What I've since been told that the difference is 2 bolts
verses 3 bolts.

Anyone have one for sale?
