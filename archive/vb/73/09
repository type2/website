<< I am considering buying a full length industrial roof rack tomorrow. How 
do I tell if it is for a early or late model. The zvw tag is no longer 
legible. I have seen racks that have the straight side bars on the front, but 
this rack has them on the side with the bent side bars facing forward. I hope 
this makes sense. It does not have the horseshoe style clamps it has clamps 
that are about 2" wide and 6" long that go from the gutter to the threaded 
rod mounted on the rack. It is similar to the rack on this green bus(almost a 
burn victim). http://vintagebus.com/gallery/image/3375.JPG

the rack on that bus looks like what I have on my 61.  I can put 4x8 sheets 
of plywood on my 61.  there are 2 length wise reinforcements that run the 
front to back direction.  I am told it is a 70s era rack.  I slightly damaged 
it (cracked some welds)  hauling bus nose to metal divider on it back for a 
junkyard 250 miles.   sticker says its rated for 300lbs or something like 
that.

THe rack on my 65 is a bit shorter, can't fits those 4x8 sheets in it, but it 
has more front to back reinforcements, and is sturdier.  I am told it is 60s, 
and it is what I call 'industrial.

there is another kind I have seen with no front to back tubes(except the 
edges) and those tend to sag in the crossbars, hear they are 50s.
