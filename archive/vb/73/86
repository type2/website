Subject: RE: [VB] What exhaust should I use?

Just an offhand question but will the bug tips clear the apron of the bus?
I actually brain farted and ended up with 2 complete German bus exhausts for
my '65 but don't want to change the muffler right away when I put the 1600
in it.

Yes!  A nice 1300-1600cc muffler for bus.
