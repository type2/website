Subject: bad milage /Re: [VB] Re.Fuel petcock

ran out of gas the other day, 2 or 3 days after the 61 had gone to 'reserve' 
and i ignored it as I thought for sure it couldn't be that low on gas 
already.   

its been cold and damp here, and I've been warming up the bus each morning 
for probably longer than it takes me to drive the 3 1/2 miles to school.  
Really kills the gas milage.
