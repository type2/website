Hi Tim,
No problem we have forwarded it!  It is always good to hear from anybody who 
lived through a mistake and will still fess up about it!  Especially 
something as life and brain cell threatening as that.  Hopefully others will 
avoid situations like that upon reading.

There are generally three kinds of people out there:
Those who will make the same mistake over and over without ever learning.
Those who will learn from thier own mistakes.
Those who will learn from the mistakes of others.
