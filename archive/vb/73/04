Subject: RE: [VB] rack questions

Later racks also seem to be shorter than spits'.  I almost bought a later
rack(also full length), prior to purchasing mine from Tom Connor.  Looked
OK, although I didn't like the curves on the ends.  When bolted down, the
basket did NOT clear the curve in my roof.  Pressed the whole thing down.
You see, I put it on the car in the dark, and couldn't figure why it was
being sooo difficult to tighten down.  After all was said, and done, I
decided to wait out the proper fitting rack.
