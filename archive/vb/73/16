 What is the difference in the Engine Lid Locks between a 66 and 67 Bus?  The 
one that is on my Decklid seems to long, even after adjusting the striker all 
the way back.  The backside of the lock itself hits the Apron.  The hook 
device goes about 1/2 inch past the plate.  I went to order one, but I'm 
afraid I'm going to get the wrong one again.  The decklid came off of a 67 
Panel (that had no back up lights).  The wrecked Lid from the 66 (had some 65 
items: church key gas door, shifter......) looks the same.  What am I missing 
here?

there is a dif engine lid latch for 66 than 67.  I thought it had to do with 
having 2 vs three screws, but Im not sure.  some 67 freak should know?.  the 
apron is the same, though, so there is a slight change in the lid between 
66/67.

btw, 66 did come with church key gas door, the non church key gas door is a 
67 thing.  It is normal for early 66 to have the earlier kind of shifter, the 
kind that doesn't fall down when you undo the screw started partway through 
the 66 model year.  But they went to the non church key engine lid for 
beginning of 66 model year.
