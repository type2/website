. How do I tell if it is for a early or late model.

Spilt screen buses a bit wider at the rain gutter. I used to have a 
3/4 VWoA rack. It was for a 1968 to 1979 model year. I ran it on my 
69 and 72 bus. When I got the 67 bus I put on the roof and found that 
it was too narrow to the tune of about 1". I used it anyway. I sat 
just inboard on the rain gutters and worked fine. I never put more 
than 100 lbs on the rack while it was on the split because I was 
concerned it would dent the roof. I have seen identical racks to my 
old one that were a bit wider so I assume that the style I had was 
carried over from the split era to the bays. If the rack in question 
turns out to be a bay rack then you could bend out the legs a bit so 
it would fit in the rain gutter.

Good luck.
