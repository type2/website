Subject: Double Cab/ Gate screws.


We removed the gates for the paint project & 

the screws didn't survive, the weather is 

improving & it's time to get this redone
 
double cab back togeather. So I'm asking if
 
any one has some to spare? I have heard the 

stiker plate screws from a Gia are the same? 

Thanks
