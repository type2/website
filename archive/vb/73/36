Subject: Re: [VB] Westy rear hatch screen

Karl,

I find if you have a walk thru, you will need an extra arbotite/wood/vinyl
trim filler piece for the left side of the inside of the hatch. This is the
mirror image duplicate of the right side piece that fills the space between
the hatch and the wardrobe cabinet. As stated, it works for '64 - '67s.
Newer bay style will be a brown shade in color were the proper split style
is yellow tan in color. Bay screen will fit in the splittie.

Scott
'67 Westy
