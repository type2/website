<< hi all
 
 i just put back my fuel petcock today but i lost my screen filter somewhere,
 so i said Bah!, dont need this i have a fuel filter in the line... then i
 screw the petcock (without the screen) and it doesnt seems to hold firmly,
 so do i really need the screen filter, does this act as a washer to prevent
 fuel leak ?? If not, why the petcock seems to be lousy... ?

yes you need the sock.  new socks are cheap.  get a spare

BTW, originally there was a sort of cork spacer thing around the two in 
spouts for the petcock.   since it was trash I tossed it... what have otehrs 
done?  not had one, toosed it, made one?
