Subject: Re: [VB] Stripped Threads, oil drain plate

I stripped out some threads in my engines's oil pressure sender hole.
Didn't have the tap to fix it right, so at Kyle's suggestion I broke
out my tubes of JB Weld and fixed it that way. Almost two months later
and it still leak free...

On an old 1600 DP engine I'm working on, I have discovered that one of
the holes where the studs that hold on the oil drain plate is stripped
out.
