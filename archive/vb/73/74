Subject: Highroof Hatch

I am told that the highroof panel van rear hatch has a different curvature 
from a regular panel van of the same year (1964).  What exactly is the curve 
difference that I can measure, as the width and height dimensions seem to be 
exactly the same?  I need to tell which hatch goes on a highroof, and which 
for a standard panel van.

Thanks,

Charles
