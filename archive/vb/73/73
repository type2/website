Subject: RE: [VB] round to square regulator

They switched from center brakelight decklid to brakelights in March 1957.
All my workshop manuals have out of date diagrams....16" wheels on 55's56's, etc.

Subject: [VB] round to square regulator


To all,

In looking at the original factory wiring diagrams it looks like the change
from round regulator to square regulator (as represented schematically) also
coincides with the change from center mounted stop light to dual stop lights
in the taillights.

I had Thom post the round vs. square regulator question in an effort to
properly date the various  factory wiring diagrams. However, since then I
have signed up to the list and would actually rather know when (month and
year) the Type 2 switched from rear center mounted brake light to brake
lights in the two taillights. I think this will be a much more accurate way
of identifying these particular wiring diagrams rather than round to square
regulator.

By the way, the actual diagrams I'm referring to, as labeled on the
vintagebus page are:

1955-1956, from 3/55 Non-USA (round regulator, center mounted stop light) 
1956-1961 Non-USA or USA (both have square regulator and stop lights in
taillights)

Any help on this question will be much appreciated.

And thanks to 'claralw' for the post included below as that has confirmed
some various generator applications.

from: claralw

with the 25hp motors they used a 130W generator and the D regulator     

for 1954  withe the 36hp motor they introduced the narrow slot 160W
generator 
and the round regulator
these are a pair

in think late 56 or early 57  (jan 57?) they went to the regular slot 160W 
gen and the square regulator

the 180W generator was introduced in june of 59, which also has a square 
regulator.

you have to make sure the Voltage, wattage and amperage of the reg and gen 
are the same.  not sure what happens if they don't match, there may be those

electrical fumes and the bad things that means.

DATE CODE INFO (BORROWED FROM sTEVE cARR)
the generators have date codes on them.  a generator 
if the code is 2L, that means buildt feb 55  The code is near the arrow on 
the generator- by where it says Bosch.  date codes on regulators are near
the 
scre wholes where it attachs to the generator.
the code is a number and letter, the letter stands for the year, and the 
number for the month.
