I have a 66 and a 67. My 67 lid was bent beyond repair so I put an extra 66 lid
on it. I used the 67 lock, it works fine. The only difference I noticed between
the 2 years was the license light. 66 has the bulb socket attached to the lens.
67 had a separate lens and the socket mounted in the lid about 4" away. Both
67's I have/had were like this.
