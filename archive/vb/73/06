Kevin makes a really good point. I recall the center front to back 
support rail on clearing the roof by and inch or two.  Because the 
VWoA rack I had was common the bays and splits and the legs are at a 
slight outward angle it stands to reason that instead of redesigning 
the entire rack they simply made the legs shorter to accommodate the 
narrower rain gutter and flatter roof on the 68 to 79 model buses.
