Subject: RE: [VB] Double Cab/ Gate screws.

Yes, ghia hinge screws are the same... someone was also selling some on the
list that are very close and Wolfsburgh West has some that work.


Good Luck

twas writ:
We removed the gates for the paint project &

the screws didn't survive, the weather is

improving & it's time to get this redone

double cab back togeather. So I'm asking if

any one has some to spare? I have heard the

stiker plate screws from a Gia are the same?

Thanks
