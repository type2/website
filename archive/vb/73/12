Subject: Re: [VB] Bus clock help.  any experts out there?

I have a good article from the May 1992 issue of
"Skinned Knuckles", a good car restoration magazine,
that I could scan and send you, but basically, as I
recall from working on Studebaker clocks, it doesn't
push the winding mechanism very far when the points
touch.  How long does it run between the solenoid
activation?  Also, yes, usually those hands (arms?)
just are a press fit, and you very carefully pull them
off.

Hope this helps.  P-mail for a copy of the article.
