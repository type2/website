I always tell my daughter to keep the "bug" out from under my feet. I don't

Well, if _I_ get in the family way, then I'm calling Guinness first! 
But...if I ever have a S.O. with whom I decide to have a child, then yes...I

would certainly consider letting my friends (including those on the list) 
have first dibs at naming. Hey, gotta practice what you preach, right? 

I can imagine the choices now...
