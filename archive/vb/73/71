Subject: ...didn't get to play, bus length of ownership

Hi,

Bad manners posting a response to a Friday topic on Monday, I know, I 
apologize. But I have been under the weather for more than a week and I 
couldn't resist.

What was the longest response?

I took 'ownership' of my bus 20 years ago! And hopefully this will be 
the year it gets back on the road (last registered in 92).

Thanks,
Conrad
