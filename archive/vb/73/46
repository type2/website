Subject: Stripped Threads, oil drain plate

On an old 1600 DP engine I'm working on, I have discovered that one of the holes where the studs that hold on the oil drain plate is stripped out.  So would you either: 1)Re-tap the threads with the next bigger size,  2)Put some sort of heliocoil in there (if so what, how, where do I get it) or 3)Just deal with the 3 inch puddle of oil that collects under the car where it is leaking around this stud.  All the other holes around the drain plate are fine, so I can tighten it down ALMOST enough with these other nuts to stop the oil leak, but not quite all the way.
P.S. I know this message is a grammatical (or is it grammarical?) nightmare, so If there are any English teachers out there, please ignor (or better yet, diagram these sentences for me and return it by the end of the day!)
