Subject: What the son said [67 rebuild - cracked case]

I called to see how the progress was going on the bus .. The father wasn't
there, but one of the sons answered.
I said "have you figured out what caused the case to crack."  He said .. "that
the motor flexing."  I said "huh ?? what does that mean .."  and he stumbled
around for words and basically said "we are fixing it with a brace."  Anyone
have any idea what he is saying or what it means ?? I will drill the owner
better if I know what I am supposed to ask.
