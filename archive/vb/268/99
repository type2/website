well, they are installing a replacement motor w/ differnt case, so that'll be 
sorted right?
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
or maybe the clunking noise 
 I heard everytime I shifted - that sounded like the engine banging around in 
 the back of the bus - was the reason for the crack.  So the case is going to 
 be replaced - their cost - but what about the banging in the engine 
 compartment, I wanted to know.

did you talk to them about checking tranny mounts?  Did you check them 
yourself?
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
   The mechanics that sold me the bus, installed the engine 
 etc .. basically got it road ready, were the ones who did the tie rod and 
 the center bushing .. another mechanic put the drag link in, and told me to 
 go get an alignment right away.  Which I did .. which straightened the wheel 
 .. which made steering better but not perfect and made a left U-turn not 
 really possible.
..................
so it sounds like the alignment guys messed up the turn radius.  Call them up 
and ask what they did.   I am used to OEM tie rods where only one is 
adjustable, but the new ones sold I think both are adjustable.  Read your Idiot book 
chapter on "Shimmies and Shakes", first, before calling them.  then when you 
take it back for them to do right, show them the chapter on that.  Make sure you 
understand hopw the steering wheel centering is a SEPARATE adjustment than 
the alignment, adjusting the steering wheel is done by popping off one end of 
the drag link, adjusting it's length, reinstalling.  This does not affect 
steering, only which was the wheel points.   Really should have been done when the 
new drag link was installed.  

does this make sense to you?   It may seem like a lot at once, but the beauty 
of the old VW is that the systems are fairly simple and straightforward.
