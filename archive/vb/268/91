Subject: Parts FT and Parts needed

Hey folks, as I finally get closer to painting this thing and enjoying it I'm
finding some extra parts I don't need and a few pieces I need.  I have a set
of off white Sunvisors and a 12 volt gauge I'd like to trade.  I bought the
gauge some time ago and don't know if it works.  It came from thesamba and I
was assured it worked.  Also have several of the popout window latches.

What I'm looking for:  rear bumper deluxe trim, 2 westy window cranks and a
Westy curtain rod for the rear hatch.
