Subject: seat stand mats

I just got a pair of seat stand mats from Wolfsburg West and was wondering 
what type of adhesive would be best to use. Also, I was thinking there 
should be a metal strip along the door side for it to slip into but my bus 
does not have that. The old ones were held in place by 10 screws with 
washers (which I know wasn't correct). I'd appreciate any advice you might 
have.

Thanks,
