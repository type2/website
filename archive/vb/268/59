Subject: today is "thee"  day

Last night I dropped my bus off at the garage.  Today and tomorrow they will
be replacing the case. Wanted to just leave it so I wasn't tempted to make any
sarcastic comments and piss him off .. Don't want a Pissed Off mechanic doing
my engine.

I also purchased a new fuel sending unit which will be delivered to his shop
today from the parts house down the street from him.. don't know if the one in
the tank is good or bad, mechanic never checked it, says he doesn't know how
... worth the $50 it cost me be SURE.  Asked them to save the old one for me
and I will keep it as a spare.  I don't let him do my thinking for me any more
and I can bet that all the parts that were once in the back of that bus are in
his garage somewhere now.   Said to just leave enough wire and I would attach
it to the gauge myself or have someone who knows how, do it for me.  Someone
electrical ..

Being I paid for electric 2 times on MrMechanics bills and $60 once to an auto
electric guy to give me lights, [all but signal lights, because I am missing
the front turn signals] I can't believe I still don't have brake lights.  Just
found that out yesterday when my boyfriend drove behind me to drop off my bus.
When he said "you don't have brake lights, I just shrugged .. " I am getting
very used to being ripped off .. I keep thinking .. "it won't happen again."
but it does.

So any way .. Bus gets fixed ??? today and tomorrow and this weekend I should
be free of the first mechanic.

Wanted to mention that when my bus dripped oil .. it didn't drip in one spot
.. it would almost look like a splatter ... drip marks all over the place from
under the bus. That's because of the case, right ?? Hopefully nothing else.
