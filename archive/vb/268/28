Well, I would if I could!  No, I mean like 7AM LA traffic drop to second
and floor it to avoid having to hit the brakes and cause an accident
type of emergency maneuver.  Or like having a mad illigial alian truck
driver running up my ass at 75mph I have to go as fast as him to get out
of his way emergency maneuver!
