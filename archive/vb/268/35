Too much is too much.
Yours is fine, it's a "swing-axle" ( as described in your Idiot book :)

Not good. Your steering needs adjustment.
Whoever adjusted the steering wheel to center it
needs to borrow the Idiot book after you finish it.
Drive ahead slowly so you know when the steering is straight.
Stop without turning the steering wheel. Then slowly turn
the steering wheel and count the "o'clocks" to left lock, then to right.
They will not be the same, and that is wrong.
The adjustments are in the tie-rods and drag link.
