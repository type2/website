Wavy washers fit the original design specifications.
The introduction of a non-stock high lift camshaft
and corresponding stiffer valve spring introduces
a side load which overcomes the wavy washer
( and bobby pin ) for which the aftermarket solution
is bolted shafts and solid shim stack.
The shims must be custom-fitted for each engine,
while the wavy washer works for production line assembly.
