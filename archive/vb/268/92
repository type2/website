Subject: Re: [VB] What the son said [67 rebuild - cracked case]

Like others said, don't worry why the case cracked.    

But you are getting a replacement case, not a 'fixed' case, right?   did you 
write down the old ,cracked, case number?   So you know you get another, ya?

 I said "have you figured out what caused the case to crack."  He said .. 
"that
 the motor flexing."  I said "huh ?? what does that mean .."  and he stumbled
 around for words and basically said "we are fixing it with a brace."  Anyone
 have any idea what he is saying or what it means ?? I will drill the owner
 better if I know what I am supposed to ask.
