Don't put volts to any starter that is not self-supporting. 
You will short the armature, and it won't spin.
If you are quick, a split-second jump is all you can get
to verify the starter as a possible keeper.
But you are better off not knowing that :)
The starter ( armature ) must be supported at both ends
to turn correctly. Either the trans or an old bellhousing will do.
