Subject: Compression Ratio (again)

OK. I never did get a good solid answer on the compression ratio for my engine. This is what I have: 78 mm crank, 90.5 mm P/C, big valve heads (40x37.5) with oval ports polished and matched to manifolds, Weber dual 42 DCNFs,Engle 110 cam, I plan to run a deck height about 0.050 - 0.060. WHAT COMPRESSION RATIO WOULD YOU RUN WITH THIS COMBINATION? Going into a first generation bus still running RBs.
This is my second attempt at porting and shaping intakes and my first attempt at manifold matching, but I like what I see! You have to think like air >.
