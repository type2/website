"Thick as toothpaste" and "never hardens", that sounds scary! Especially
around the case where tolerance is critical. Permatex 3-H is as close to the
factory sealant that I've found and I have never had a problem with it in the
last 33 years. It is the case sealant of choice for high performance engines
like Lycoming and Continental aircraft motors which are also air cooled. I
even use it on the high temp Corvair engines, once the block halves are
resurfaced of course. I would be interested on the longevity of your engines.

We carry "Curil T" at my work, ...

This stuff was awesome. It has the consistancy of toothpaste (even looks like
green toothpaste), and smells like aftershave. It was interesting stuff. It
never hardens, always stays soft. I used it on everything on my engine.I even
put it on my pushrod tubes, which worked out great for holding them inplace
while I put the heads on.
