Subject: Re: [VB] What the son said [67 rebuild - cracked case]

We really can't help you until you tell is, in specific terms, exactly  **
where ** the case is cracked. In other words, we need to know where on the
case the place the crack starts and the place on the case where the crack
ends. Pictures would be even better!

If the case is cracked in a non-critical area, it will be hard to convince
the mechanic to replace the entire case.

Like others said, don't worry why the case cracked.

But you are getting a replacement case, not a 'fixed' case, right?   did you
write down the old ,cracked, case number?   So you know you get another, ya?

 the motor flexing."  I said "huh ?? what does that mean .."  and he

Anyone
 have any idea what he is saying or what it means ?? I will drill the owner
