I don't know if the smallest Lycoming 4 cylinder would be right in line with
type 1 since it is 180 hp (-at-) 2700 rpm:

I sure would like my truck engine to be rated at that, and that reliable at
that hp.

At 0.5 HP/in^3 these aren't exactly high performance.  They're right in
line with a type 1 VW!
