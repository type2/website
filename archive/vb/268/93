Subject: Bus Song & Alaska

Some random thoughts on busses and Alaska.
KVMR.org radio has a show Friday morning 
hosted by someone with Alaska connections,
and plays Alaskan artists. This morning
she played an artist who was in town recently.

Dave Manning drove down to the California
area in his '65 VW bus, and plays a great
piano and is a wonderful story teller. I
was able to catch some of his work on the
radio.

I heard a song this morning about a VW bus
from a group called Thumb Taxx. The start
of the chorus is, " The Volkswagen bus won't
start . . ." and includes a couple of reasons
why, including the lack of fuel. It's a fun
little song. The song title is Davos.

I did a quick search on the web for Thumb Taxx
and while I found sites showing where they are
playing, I didn't find any CD sources or a site
for the band itself. If anyone is in Alaska, 
they might be able to find the CD and provide 
the list with the lyrics.
