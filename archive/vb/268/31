Subject: Steering Question - Wheels .. 2 ?'s

Just curious ..
1)  Replaced the center bushing.
2)  Replaced the tie rod ends.
3)  Replaced the drag link.
4)  Got an alignment.  [my steering wheel is finally straight again.  Hasn't
been since the first job, tie rod ends.]

Steering is much better.  I wouldn't say perfect, but maybe it is just
different than the 71 bus and takes some getting used to.

1)  Boyfriend was driving behind me and said the tires look VERY EXAGGERATED,
the way they point in in the back.  How much is TOO MUCH ???

2)  Turning.  U-turns.  When I make a tight right the wheel turns fine, feels
normal.  But when I turn hard left .. the wheel is turning and then seems to
stop hard with less of a turn.  I have yet to turn the wheel to the right
where is just can't turn any further ... is this normal ?? Left U turns are
next to impossible  .. or have to be VERY wide U-turns.
