Taylor,
	I'm thinking along the lines Steve is, that your noise may be 
coming from the rocker arm assembly or there about.  I think that it is 
a good idea to disassemble the rockers and rebuild them using solid 
washers instead of the wavy washers.  They wear out and break and they 
may be allowing the rocker arms too much side play????   Gary Gibson
