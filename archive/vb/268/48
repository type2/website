Hi Volks,
Make sure to do this with the front end jacked up just enough to have the 
front wheels off the ground.  This makes it easier to move the steering and is 
alot easier on the steering box.  We also try to only turn the steering when in 
motion which puts less stress on the steering box.  Since steering boxes are 
getting rarer and $$$ for a rebuild you might as well take it easy on that part 
of your bus.
