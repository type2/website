At Wally world or the like I picked up a couple of cup holders designed to
mount through the air conditioning vents of a "regular" car. I replaced
the clamps that hook into the vent with a couple of long bolts and rubber
washers for spacing and protection of the dash paint. I made several and
gave them away to my Buskatier buddies. The angle can be adjusted to meet
the curve of the dash and will support a regular can/bottle no problem.
