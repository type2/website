Subject: Re: [VB] What the son said [67 rebuild - cracked case]

I don't know what he's saying, but I do know what it means. It means he doesn't 
have a clue. I wouldn't get all upset about what the son says. He doesn't know 
what's going on.

Just get your bus back out of this shop as quickly as possible for as little 
money as possible. I wouldn't expect it to be fixed right, but I wouldn't argue 
with them any more about it. It's clear that they'll never get it right, but 
they'll drain your bank account dry if they can. You need to avoid any shop 
that can't put a drag link in a bus without screwing up the steering.

Didn't you mention in an earlier post that they promised you a replacement 
case? Maybe the son doesn't know the difference between a "case" and a "brace".

Don't drill anybody, just pay your bill, get your bus, and run.
