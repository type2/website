Have they worked since you put on the new housings?  If not...are you
sure you used dual-filament bulbs?  :)  Look for two independent
filaments, and two solder spots on the bottom of the bulb instead of
just one.  The pins on the bulb base are supposed to be keyed so it's
hard to do this, but some sockets are looser than others and I've
seen it done before.

Are the wires OK at the sockets?  Each side should have a thin gray
wire (with stripe) for the tail light and a fatter black wire (with
stripe) for the stop/turn light connected to the front (FRONT) of
the socket where the base of the bulb is.  The ground should connect
to the bare metal of the reflector somewhere.

Outside of that, get a wiring diagram from http://www.vintagebus.com/wiring/
and check it out.  You've got a fuse for the left tail light and one
for the license and right tail lights.  Both of these are fed by one
wire from the headlight switch.  If you can't get any juice on this
wire, and it's securely plugged into the headlight switch, and your
headlights and front running lights work, the problem is probably
inside your headlight switch.

Stock, there shouldn't be any difference beteween 1966 and 1967 USA
models.  Deluxes will have two extra wires at the headlight switch
(power and light for the clock).
