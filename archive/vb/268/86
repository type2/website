Probably is the case.
Because of the cracks it would expand in abnormal ways
& this could affect anything.
This includes pushrod tubes, which are leak-prone
anyway, and you have rear main problems already, don't
you.
Once a bit of oil is in a active part of the engine,
not even thinking about how much your engine is
pushing out, the fan & usually manages to pick up some
of that hot oil & blow it around the engine.
As a consequence the oil dripping from your cooling
flaps could be from a leak anywhere on the case.
I think I speak for everyone on the list when I say
we're praying hard that this is the end of the hell
this mechanic has put you through.
He's giving good VW workshops a bad name & making the
whole public profile of buses worse when he does poor
work on a vehicle resulting in a breakdown.
Just don't let him get away with ANYTHING.

Cheers & God Bless
