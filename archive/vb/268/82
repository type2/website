Hi Jdd,
That will work just fine.  We have had vintage two inch diameter yellow glass 
trailer lights mounted on the upper corners of our rear license plate for 
secondary brake and turn signals.  So far we have had this set up on our 1960 
walk thru panel camper conversion thru 16 states, Canada BC and about 200,000 
miles without a single law enforcement employ giving us any trouble about them!
  Eric's sister got a 1969 Canadian panel camper conversion about two years 
ago and soon after mounted fog lights on the rear bumber just below the 
taillights with no hassle either.
  Makes a hugely noticable differance when changing lanes.  Other drivers 
actually let us over and pass us with no finger in the air!
