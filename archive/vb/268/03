Subject: Re: [VB] 6V Starter

um, for some reason I have spare 6V starters.  Doesn't everyone?  People give 
me their 6V stuff when they go to 12V, so I have all this good 6V stuff.  

you could check if they have 6V starters at schucks/kragens.   I get my 12V 
starters there (warranty, easy to change) though you can get new bosch ones for 
what $130 or something.  I never bothered to take a starter apart, so I don't 
know any tricks to make them go.   Just test them in a tranny bell housing.  
They say always test them in a support like that, unles it's an autostick 
starter.

 but I just sits there and won't turn.  I've tested it on the ground and
 in a housing with the correct bushing, but no go.  I even hooked up a
 12V battery to it and still nothing...started to smoke though.
 
  I pulled the end cap off thinking I would clean up the brushes and
 comutator, but my soldering iron would not get hot enough to remove the
 brushes from the bracket.  I shot motor cleaner in and blew it
 out...still nothing.
 
 Is it toast? Are new 6v starters available?  Anyone have a good one I
 can buy?
 
 Thanks!  I have to get this motor running!
