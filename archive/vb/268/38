Gene Berg was pretty adamant about keeping the CR down for street
engines on pump gas, claiming 91-octane premium "will just barely
support 7.0:1" and that 6.6:1 was best for regular.  The "High
Performance" chapter by Colin Messer in later editions of the
Idiot manual recommends a 6.5:1 max for regular gas.  The Strength-
through-Joy Car Factory peaked out at 8.5:1 on leaded 95 RON gas
in 1966; starting in 1970 they used a max of 7.7:1 on 91 RON and
8.2:1 on 98 RON leaded.  (RON is approximately 5 more than the
number on the pump in the US, so 91 RON ~= "86 octane" and 98 RON
~= "93 octane".)

Depending on what gas you can get where you're at, it seems like
something between 7:1 and 8:1 might be good.  If you're willing
to run race gas, maybe 8.5:1 ?
