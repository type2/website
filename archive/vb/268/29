Does anyone have any spares of "that rubber block" or know how to make
one?

Thanks,

You shouldn't have to use any glue.  It's got a prickly thing on the top
that goes into the seal for the entire sliding window area.  And then
there's a small rubber block that hold it in at the bottom.  The last
screw that holds the metal strip with 4 indentions on it (for the
sliding window to latch into) also goes into that rubber block to keep
it in place.  If you need this explained a little better, just ask.  I
replaced the seals right there not long after I bought my bus.
