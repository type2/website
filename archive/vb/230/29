Subject: 67 master cylinder/do I have to buy a new one?

Howdy Volks,
Does anyone know where I can find a rebuild kit for my
'67 master cylinder?  Does anyone even make these
anymore?  Everyone I've talked to says I would have to
buy a new one and I would rather not drop a couple
bills if I don't absolutely have to.  Thanks for the
advice in advance.
