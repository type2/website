Subject: RE: [VB] What's the knob for??

Closest to you is the choke.  The one on the right is the fuel tap.

Another Dave pondered...

A curious question:  Went back to the Bus I got the small round
taillights out
of a couple of years ago.  Noticed I had missed some black dash knobs.
Down
on the floor on either side of the heater knob there was two , I
believe, pull
knobs.  The knobs where the same type used on the dash for the lights
and
wipers.  What were these for?  The Bus had the round glass Taillights
and
Bullet turn Signals.
