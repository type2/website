OK.  Thanks.  :)

Nah.  The calculations I am doing are along the lines of "does 10,000
Btu/hr of cooling require closer to 0.4 hp or 4 hp?"  If I wanted to
know if it was 3.14 or 3.15 hp, then we'd have to go talk to Dalton,
Boyle, Charles, Guy-Lussac, Avogadro, et al.

Since my Bus has six pop-outs, I think I'll stick with the time-proven
10/50 * A/C system for now.  12/50 would probably work even better, but
that system tends to increase the humidity in the parcel tray and front
floor a lot.
