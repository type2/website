Hi Bob.
Sounds normal to us!

It depends on how the last person torqued it, over torqued it, or did/did not 
put a little grease on the threads of the gland bolt to keep the rust monster 
away.  Yes it can be undone with hand tools and yes it is like the rear axle 
nuts!  We used a 3/4" drive 36mm Craftman socket and a Proto 3/4" L-shaped 
breaker bar.  We used to use the 1/2" and later the 3/4" Craftsman breaker 
bars which resulted in broken and bent bars. One 3/4" turned slowly into a 
spiral after so many repairs and two others were cleanly broken off!!!  The 
Proto breaker bar only costs about $10.00 more and so far even with a 8'+ 
long cheater bar with one of us dangling from and a pair of super stuck 46mm 
rear axle nuts we have not been able to even bend it!!!  For the FW the only 
other tool you need is a FW lock you can pick up at any VW shop for about 
$10.00.
