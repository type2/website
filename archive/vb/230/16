Subject: RE: [VB] Vents... latches and whistling

The tipper vent on the driver side whistles... with og seals, but the
pass side doesn't.  The v80 seals don't whistle but then again, reaching
45+ miles/hr is a rarity :-O 

Oh, I just posted up a picture of the differences between the bug and
bus latches...
