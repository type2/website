I also had a carb/alternator interference problem. Running a 34 PICT-3 that
I couldn't get to run right. Tossed it and rebuilt another, but this one fit
perfectly with no problems with the alternator. Looking at the one I tossed
it looked like the linkage had been bent up compared to it's replacement.
