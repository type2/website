Subject: Color and M codes

Hi, the '64 singlecab I just picked up has 414180 for color codes. That looks 
like light gray if my books are correct. However, this vehicle is kind of a 
faded light creme or beige with a white nose and side stripes. I have checked 
every stitch of metal, doors jambs, inside door panels, scrapped every where, 
and there's no sign of gray anywhere. Did I interpret the codes correctly?

Also, 428 is one of the M codes, but I don't see that in any of my books?
