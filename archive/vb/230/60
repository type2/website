 there is a major gap on the drivers side that leads me to believe I
 don't quite have everything I need.
...................
the rear tin is off a later bug or bus (68 on) it has the big pre heat hole.  
 splitties and 67 earlier bugs had the smaller pre heat holes.    But the 
crucial issue here is that you want a matching rear tin and tin between the 
case and crank pulley. Then there will be no gap.  the two need to match.  So 
do you have and extra tin lying around?  go find someone who does and find a 
pair of rear tin/between crank pulley and case tin that match.   If you get 
another rear tin make sure the width between the screws holes at each end are 
the same, there are 40hp rear tins that look similar but are slightly too 
small.

 So while putting all the accessories on tonite I got the alternator
 mounted then noticed that there was a problem. The carb accelerator
 pump linkage is hitting the alternator body causing it not to open
 fully. pics of the close proximity are here:

BTDT.
you need a spacer to raise the carb up a bit.  Another option I have heard is 
to grind into the alternator casing a tad.  I've just used a spacer between 
carb and manifold..  Dunno if I ever saw a DP size one though.

 Last but not least the reason I had to get a new long block.
