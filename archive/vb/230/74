Subject: flasher relays

I am trying to determine which is better...
after-market flasher relay vs. newer relay conversion kit

I have to replace this item in my '67 bus and was told that they don't exist 
by one parts store and was offered a conversion kit.
Another parts store said that aftermarket relays were available and I could 
order one.
I don't know which would be better, they both cost similar in price.
I'm not looking for NOS but, I don't want to put a poor peice in that is 
pretty crucial for the electrical system.
Has anyone replaced theirs and can tell me the difference?
Thank you.
Melissa
