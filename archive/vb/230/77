Hi All,

I'm looking for a favor to help a friend out in Belgium.  My friend
'Kurt' in Belgium was looking for a good roof for his double cab
project.  I poked around here in the states and found one for him near
San Francisco (Newark actually).  Kurt paid the guy, 'Scott' and Scott
was to get the cab roof to a container bound for the BBT shop in Belgium
where he would pick it up.  Fast forward about 6 months and Scott is
having problems getting the roof to Wilmington CA (near San Diego).

Can anybody help out here??? Maybe even a two or three person hand off?
You'll help make a fellow bus enthusiast in europe very happy.


TIA,


David
