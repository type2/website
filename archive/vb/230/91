Subject: Anyone want Euro T-Lights???

Anyone want a set of repop Euro style taillights? I bought a set on EBay and
really don't like the look of Euro lights like I thought I would.  Would love
to trade them for a set of good (good reflective material wise) US housings.
They cost me $32 after shipping, if you don't have a set of lights to trade
make me an offer.  I also need a good Nose emblem that has the studs left on.
I be willing to also kick in some cash for a REAL NICE set of US stock
taillight housings.

Dave
