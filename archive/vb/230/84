I always keep a couple of wide flat top front tin for buses/trucks, but have a
growing pile or round top beetle tin. As far as the heat exchangers go, I have
in the past used able extenders to reach.

A couple of issues I encountered putting a '70 single port into a 65 bus:

- front tin is wrong; I need doghouse tin from a Beetle, I guess.
- heat exchanger flap connections are high and outside rather than low and
inside, and I see no easy way to make them work.

Just a passing observation.
