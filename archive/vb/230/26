  I think you should stay home and send Paula on her way. That will give you
a few days to bond with your kids and dogs on your own

ronnie  go Paula GOOOOOO

For years I wished to attend the Red Barn pre-Kelly event. Still do, but
prefer
to plan a little in advance and maybe rest up.

Wednesday night my wife asked if I was sure that Kelly Park had occured
already. I corrected her that no, it was this weekend. She implored me to
take
time off from work, excuse myself from helping at church on Sunday, pack the
kids in the Eurocamper and haul West/Northwestwardly toward California.

Alas, lack of planning, prior commitments and a quiet dread of a 1600 mile
round trip with an endlessly crying nine month old, a feisty three year old,

two dogs and my exhausted wife is not my choice. Times have changed that it
is
now I who prefers not to jump at an impromptu roadtrip. I could do them all
a
favor and take off with a VW road partner, a fleet of decent cigars, some
hot
traveling CDs and go search for Rubber Johnny. I could give the rest of the
family a break from endlessly seeing me. That's just kind of nice guy that I
am.

*THAT* would not fly! The wife probably wishes that SHE could bail for the
weekend, leaving me to juggle the homestead. Debbie, Dee-Dee, Evelyn,
Melissa
(of any lastname) and Paula should run without the "old men".

Everyone have fun and look for a cheap set of mint Dasher hubcaps for me.
