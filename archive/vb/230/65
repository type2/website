Subject: super 1500 - further questions.

took apart the salvaged t3 upright today; i wasn't sure it was worth 
it, but i found shortened pushrods, so wrench on!
the oil pump IS a 1500 super pump... stamped on the cover, stamed on 
the pump body. so i gather this is a porsche oil pump?
the pistons were metel leve and looked ok; cyls were toast - rusted.
everything came apart fine even tho the crank would not turn. rods 
were free, however... inside i found an aftermarket cam gear of some 
sort mounted on a standard vw 113109101c stick.  cam gear reads 'made 
in west germany AG V2  446 05' and has a logo of a gear with 'CKC' 
inside. who made it?

crank was NEARLY perfect... a little rust, but it looks almost as new 
as my new one! it is a vw forged crank, but i need to investigate and 
see what the stroke is. has 311b rods.  rockers looked to be standard 
vw, so i can't really see why the pushrods were shortened.
crank was seized by corrosion at main #1... other than that, the 
lifters looked flat but that's it.
heads had water damage but otherwise were nice 311 ... 373A heads. my 
goofy neighbors seem to have taken a perfectly good hotrod T3 motor 
and let it rot in the yard. sad.
i'll salvage anything that sounds innaresting; otherwise it's scrapmetal time.
