The adjustment is on the rear of the sunroof. There is a flat strip of metal 
with 8 to 10 screw holes which anchors the fixed end of the sunroof. You 
adjust the tension here by letting out or gathering in more fabric. I hope 
this helps if not I can scan the manual to you.                      Mike
