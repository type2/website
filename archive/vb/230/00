Is the inspection happening in the US or Germany?  If it's in the US you
can probably do something simple to get it to pass.  If you're up for the
full Technischer Ueberwachungs Verein work-up, then you have to do it up
right.

I'm assuming that this Bus has the Euro-spec tail lights: red running/
brake lights, amber turn signals.  In that case, the basic idea is to
install a switch in parallel with the turn signal switch so that both
left and right sides flash at once.

In the US, you can probably get away with installing any random
double-pole, single-throw switch.  The "left turn" wire gets connected
to one pole, and the "right turn" wire gets connected to the other.
The remaining two terminals on the switch get connected together and
to the output of the turn signal flasher.  Like so...

+-------- Black/white/green wire at turn signal switch or "S" terminal
|         of turn signal flasher
|
*---/ --- "L" wire (black/white) at turn signal switch
|
+---/ --- "R" wire (black/green) at turn signal switch

When you flip the switch, all 4 amber lamps should flash.

The T\V may have further requirements, including but not limited to:

1) The turn signal flasher is rated for the load
2) The switch is rated for the load
3) Blinking red light in the switch knob or next to the switch
4) Hazards work with key on or off

#1 can be met by replacing the stock '66 Bus flasher with a larger-capacity
one.  The stock one was probably rated 2x18 W or maybe 2x21 W; you need
one rated 4x21 W.  Most flashers in German cars have this rating printed
right on the flasher, so it's easy to check.

The easiest way to meet #2 and #3 (and optionally, #4) is probably to use
the hazard switch from a '70-up Euro-spec Bus.  If you don't have to meet
#4, leave terminals 30, 15, and + on the hazard switch unconnected.  49a
on the hazard switch goes to the black/green/white wire at the turn signal
switch or the "S" terminal on the flasher.  R on the hazard switch goes to
the black/green wire at the turn signal switch, and L on the hazard switch
goes to the black/white wire at the turn signal switch.  31 on the hazard
switch goes to ground.  This will do the same thing as the schematic
above, plus flash the light in the switch knob.

If you have to meet #4 as well, the simple way is to move the turn
signal flasher power wire at the fuse box (probably black/purple/white)
from the hot-with-key-on fuse to the hot-all-the-time fuse.  That way,
the hazards will work with the key off -- and so will the turn signals.
If you want to be totally correct: hazards work anytime, turn signals
only work with key on, you need to hook up the other three terminals on
the '70-up hazard switch.  30 on the hazard switch goes to the hot-all-
the-time fuse.  15 on the hazard switch goes to the hot-with-key-on fuse.
The original wire from the turn signal flasher to the fuse box, probably
black/purple/white, should be unplugged from the fuse box and plugged
onto + on the hazard switch.  With the switch pushed in, the turn signal
flasher is powered from 15 (hot with key on) as before, but with the
switch pulled out, it's powered from 30 (hot all the time).

http://www.vintagebus.com/wiring/bus-65.jpg should be the wiring diagram
for your Bus, as-is.

http://www.vintagebus.com/wiring/Transporter_from_August_1969-1.jpg shows
how the hazard switch (item E3) was wired on a stock '70 Euro-spec Bus.

Good luck!
