Subject: Trans shaft movement and Gland nut removal

Hello all

Still fighting the battle of the clutch here.

1st question-- How much movement of the transmission shaft (I want to call
this the input shaft) is acceptable??  With the engine removed, I can take
this shaft and move it around 1/8 ", maybe a little more.  Is that normal??
It seems like a lot to me, but I don't know.

2nd question--How difficult is it to remove the Gland nut?   Reading Muir,
it looks like a major undertaking.  Can you do it with hand tools or is it
like the nuts on the rear axel??

Thanks!!

Bob
