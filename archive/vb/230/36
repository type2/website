Hi Jason,
sounds like you have a rear engine tin from a later 1970s type 1 and the tin 
in front of the pulley from a 1963ish through very early 1970s tin.

Definitely the latter and the only solution is to find pieces of tin that not 
only fit together but fit the 1500-1600cc engine.
Happy hunting!
