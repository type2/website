Subject: whistling vents

heads up for whistling vents.  If they whistle they
probably will always whistle.  
-Considering my bus I have no experience here.  My
vent window on the passenger side has been broken for
ten years.  When I restore everything I'll try to
remember to comment on this.
-Considering my Trooper on the other hand I have
experience.  First I used paper folded up to take up
the slack to eliminate the whistle.  The paper always
slipped and I got the bright idea the gap when pushed
tight was almost the distance of a quarter.  After a
50 cent fix, one on each side, it still whistled. 
After I had my vent window on the drivers side broken
while someone was trying to break in, I replaced it
with new rubber.  After the passengers door hinge
broke, I decided while the door was apart it would be
a good time to replace the vent window rubber.  ( this
is the reason why my bus isn't done, once apart I know
I won't be able to stop)  Now with brand new seals on
both windows it still whistles just not as loud.
-Considering my Work Truckfor two years, an Isuzu
cabover experience.  When riding in it I would place
the folded paper as it was free and people tended to
take the quarters.  Really annoying when there are
only two of us and the other guy is swearing he didn't
take my 50 cents.  Happened twice, so every time I
would add the folded paper, it would make the whistle
less noticeable but it was still there.
  The rivet or hinge will create the whistling sound. 
Unless you can make this component smooth when
rebuilding, I'll bet that vent will whistle. 
Hopefully when I build my truck from the ground up,
I'll pay attention to this aspect and see what's
possible.  Sorry its so long, thanks for reading.
