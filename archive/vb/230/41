Hi Clara,
Well we have not replaced those seals yet, but the OG ones on the 1960 walk 
thru panel camper conversion look fine and are supple.  After trying to 
tighten the latches with thin pieces of cardboard to figure out how much to 
bend the tabs for the latches.  We gave up and installed trimmed down 
household door foam tape-like sealant to the portions rear of the wing glass 
where the whistling occuring.  Only needed this sealant on lower half of 
driver and much less on passenger bottoms of the wing windows, so best guess 
is the lower piviot points are worn allowing the bottom the the windows to 
tilt out slightly.  Which in turn requires way too much wing window latch 
pressure to literally bend the lower half of the wing windows closed.
  Perhaps a welding and redrilling of the hole through the window frame and 
welding and filing down of the shaft are required for a proper fit.
  A cheap stethoscope with the piece you put normally against the chest to 
hear a heartbeat removed works dandy for finding the sourse of the whistle!
No whistles for us, and the wing window latches do not have to be torqued 
close to thier breaking point!!
