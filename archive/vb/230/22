Subject: windshield glass- bring to BYOB- Sigla glass FT

Hi,
I am looking for a set of windshield glass.
Logos don't matter but it's for a 65.
I will be a BYOB so if you got it, bring em on down.
I have a piece of Sigla side stationary glass for trade if
that makes it more enticing for you. Or if your in the 
Bay Area I can pick up.
Thanks!
Larry
