Hi Tim & Clementine,
Chassi # 614 456 = MAY1960, your chassi # of 144 268 sounds like a close 
match to 1 144 303 = 05 AUG1963.
  Here is some questions to clinch if your bus is a 1963 or early 1964 model:
1.  Do you have the wide rear hatch used after 1963 model year?
2.  Do you have the flipper or push button style front door handles?
3.  Innie or outie vent louvers?
4. Do you have a bracket welded to the ceiling of the engine compartment on 
the right side for 1500cc engine air cleaner?
