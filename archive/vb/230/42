Subject: Hi and redux box

I'm JT, new to the list and have a 58 panel I bought off of one Mr 
Andy Strom, should he happen to be on this list, thanks for the bus!

I'm replaceing the tranny, pretty pumped about it, cleaning some 
stuff up and waiting for my new center section to arrive.  Meanwhile, 
I have the redux boxes open (big 46mm nut, I'm assuming a later model 
box), and the final drive shaft, if that's what it's called, seems 
loose with the shaft still in the box half.  All of the other 
bearings spin smoothly, no play.  Can anyone tell me what I should 
look out for, and should I need to rebuild the boxes, where to get 
the good parts.
