Hi Jeff,
#1. All VW stock wheels have a manufacture date code stamped on them and ealy 
rims have even the manufacture stamped on them.

#2.  All 15" wheels were for later half of 1955 through early 1964 model 
buses.  Though there were some 15" rims made later for replacement parts.

#3. The only main differances between 15" bus rims is the crows foot rims 
made before about 1960.  Non-crows foot rims do not have the raised 
strengthing ribs in a radial pattern outward from each lug bolt and each have 
a differant length slits between the inner and outer portions of the rim.  

Where are you located?  We have plently of 14" wide five lug bus rims for 
trade!
