Subject: 1600 sp into 65 bus

A couple of issues I encountered putting a '70 single port into a 65 bus:

- front tin is wrong; I need doghouse tin from a Beetle, I guess.
- heat exchanger flap connections are high and outside rather than low and inside, and I see no easy way to make them work.

Just a passing observation.
