You're welcome.

I noticed I mis-spoke on something:

>>The #559 matches the original VW setup where the pilot light is connected
>>between battery voltage and ground.
                              ^^^^^^
That should say "battery voltage and _flasher_".  In American cars, the
flasher powers the pilot light; in VWs, the flasher grounds it.
