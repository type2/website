Subject: Re: all the cooling and a/c talk

I was just talking to my boss a Mech Eng of many years. We work in the
HVAC industry so his input is somewhat relavant to the a/c discussion.
Here are some of the things he had to say about this topic.

the conversion of 1HP = ~2545 BTU/hr is only a motor conversion. that
is 1hp motor will give off 2545 BTU/hr of heat if it doesn nothing
else. It is a conversion of work to work (or it might be power to
power, or heat to heat, I'm still somewhat foggy on this topic)

How much air can be cooled down (read btu removed) cannot be just
directly pulled from a HP rating. The entire system has to be taken
into account. Things such as air temp, air speed, quality of coil etc
all come into play. He did confirm that the newer higher efficiency
compressors will cause a system to cool the same with less power
input. There might be a huge long math formula for deciding what the
cooling would be, but you would have to know a lot about the system.
He suggested the best way would be to install then dyno the unit :)

I think i'll just go for the open window unit myself :)
