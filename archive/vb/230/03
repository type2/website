All,

The below was sent to the Library e-mail.  Helen is apparently in the UK;
if you can help, respond to her, not me!

Help!!  I need some advice, and I don't know where to start.  I have a
type 2 which is an awesome purple colour, but goes nowhere!  I had a
complete body-work overhaul last year but got completely stitched by a
garage in Preston.  I took it out three times before the big end went,
and now it's sitting rotting again because I can't find anywhere I trust
to sort it out.  Can you advise where I might call or look on the
internet for trustworthy garages near Kendal in the Lake District?

I would really appreciate your help if you have any advice you can give
me

Many thanks
Helen
