Subject: pulley dimensions, again

OK, I lost my handy dandy wall chart the last time I moved. Now I am in the
process of sorting sheet metal and am into the three boxes of pulleys. Right
away I find that I am faced with three different size pulleys an I have
forgotten diameter. Before I moved they were sitting on the shelf stacked to
size and application, now they are just stacked! I could use the largest one
or go to the smallest for a power pulley application heh heh. No, really, just
need to know what application each pulley was intended. I have an assortment
of 40 hp and 1500/1600 pulleys.

Thanks
