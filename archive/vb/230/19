Subject: engine tin question

I have a engine tin question. I meant to take a few pics to show, but
went to work & forgot. My 66 came w/ a DP engine and tin that doesn't
seem quite right. I'm putting the tin on my new 1600 from ac.net & I
wanted to sort the issue out before putting it all together. The cyl
tin fits fine, both upper & lower pieces & the holes seem to line up.
The pulley side if the engine seems to give me problem. The drivers
side has a rectangular gap when assembled between the rearmost tin
(the piece which the heat risers connect through) and the tin behind
the pulley. On the passenger side the same rearmost tin doesn't want
to fit correctly where it mates to the upper engine tin. This is a
pretty vauge description & I'll get some pics up to help show what I
am asking. If anyone has any good pics of the tinware needed to put a
DP engine in a 66 it would help. Or if this problem sound like
something that would happen w/ a part from car "a" which won't work as
well as a part from bus "b" let me know.

TIA
