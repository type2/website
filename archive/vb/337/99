Subject: RE: [VB] winter is coming-heater question

Hi Rick,

Basically it sounds like it should be relatively easy to fabricate my own
switch? I would rather have an original looking switch.

I just did some searching on the samba, and found this:
http://www.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=92943

I think it would be easier to take a switch for a SW heater for a
T1(although this guy isn't sure where his is from) and extend it. This way I
still get the 'factory look'.

As I have never seen a switch or the actual mechanism-I am imagining it to
basically be a knob on the end of a long wire that goes to the heater-that
moves something-ie a mechanical switch instead of an electrical one. 

The heater he is selling is an 8335 and mine is an 8332. I'm going to look
over the service manual I have and see if the parts numbers match up...but
any suggestions beforehand are appreciated...

Thanks

Kevin the controls on the SW heaters are pretty straight forward.  From the
factory, the control unit was a push pull cable with a turn knob switch on
the end.  You would pull the knob out a little bit, then turn the switch.
The switch is just an off/on switch to power the unit, pulling on the cable
set the thermostat so the temperature of the air coming out of the heater
would either be warm (cable pushed in) or melt your tennis shoes hot (cable
pulled out).  You could install a push pull cable, then a toggle switch
beside it and do the same thing as the original.
