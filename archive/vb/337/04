Subject: 65' Splitty single port, redid alot, no start, help

Hi, I'm in Bristol, CT. I am restoring a 65 with a single port motor, and it's not startinig, or rather won't stay started. I put a carb on it, new point, new coil. It will start after about a million cranks, it revs, then dies. If I'm lucky it will stay running until I get back to the engine compartment before it dies. I'm a mechanic just starting in the field, so I know about the componunts, but I'm still getting used to all this. Does it sound like a carb issue, a timing issue, any ideas?
 
please help in Bristol,
Tracy
:-)
