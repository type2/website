Subject: stuck motor?

I'm helping a friend with his bus, and have run into a
snag.

First a little background:

Trans went bad about three years ago, and bus has sat
since then. Engine would run, but wouldn't go into any
gears. When I took the nosecone off, the broken
"hockey stick" explained that.

I also noticed that the drive shaft coming out of the
back of the tranny looked sort of off center.

So now I've put in a new trans, and am getting ready
to put the motor back in, but I noticed this about it
-
The motor was at TDC, and wouldn't go any further
clockwise. I can rotate almost all the way around
counter clockwise -- maybe 350 degrees, but then it
"thunks" to a stop again. Then I can rotate it back
around clockwise to TDC, and get another "Thunk", and
it won't go any further. Any ideas as to what could be
the problem?

Thanks guys!
