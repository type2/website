I was thinking of something like this:

Put a 4" thin drainpipe under the luggage rack running fore-aft from the
front of the rack to the rear wing window (talking Bay here, splitty folk
translate as needed).

Plumb pipe with appropriate elbows through the
window to the bus interior and seal rest of opening.

Install mister nozzle at inlet of pipe and run 1/8 line up the pipe and
into interior to the water pump.

Install 5-gallon water tank in interior with electric pump to feed mister
nozzle.  5 gallons would give you enough water to last a while.

Arrange drain line to take any water that remains liquid at the aft end of
the pipe and return it to the tank.

The way this would work is that ram air from the motion of the bus will
enter the front end of the pipe and be humidified and cooled by the mist
nozzle.  It will continue into the cabin through the rear wing window.
Any water that doesn't get evaporated will fall to the bottom of the tube
and return to the water tank.

Like any other swamp cooler, you simply crack a window on the opposite
side of the bus to direct airflow.

I haven't tried this sort of thing yet, but it seems like it might be a
good way to go.  Make the duct long enough and the water will evaporate
well and not spray into the interior.
