Subject: Hella relay kit

 If  anyone out there has been using the "Hella Caravan single-relay kit" for
using an auxiliary battery to power accessories, I have a problem/question.
 I have an auxiliary single-relay batt. kit installed in my '61 Westy.  I'm
having a problem blowing fuses when the key is turned on.  I traced the wiring
out and it all seems to be in order.  With the blue/red wire detached from the
aux. batt. the wire is live/hot when the key is on when I attach it to the
aux. batt. the fuse blows.  The aux. batt. is not shorted out and does hold a
charge just fine.

 Any help?

 Lou
