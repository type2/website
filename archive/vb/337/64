It shouldn't be too difficult to make a workable press. I
replaced the quarterlight glass on one of my Beetles many
years ago without a press. Lots of dishwashing liquid as a
lubricant on the glass, frame and rubber allowed me to get
it almost seated by hand, then I finished off with some
gentle persuasion with a rubber mallet.
