Subject: Splitty wanted for Ontario driver

Hi Volks,

I've been asked to search out a split-window westy for a local 
baywindow owner. He wants something solid and reliable, which can be 
pretty hard to find up here. He's a self-employed/semi-retired 
photographer who I met at a camp-out this past weekend.

Price is not an issue. This guy will pay a reasonable amount for a good 
bus, and he knows what it costs to refurb something.

Location is not an issue, we for the right bus we'd fly out and drive 
it back. So it would have to be in excellent mechanical condition, and 
have a clear title.

Year is not an issue.

Condition is critical. This guy isn't interested in a project, he wants 
something that's good to go, nothing needed.

Please let me know if you have any good leads. I already know where to 
find thesamba.com.... I'm asking the list if they know of anything that 
isn't listed, or if they can recommend something from TheSamba that 
they have seen firsthand.

THANKS!
