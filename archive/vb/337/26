Subject: My apologies

My mail to this list kept bouncing, saying that i was using too many quotes,
even though I wasn't using any. So I'm sorry if I posted more than once.

There were two questions about Bays today so I wanted to make sure I wasn't
dumb enough to be posting to the wrong Type 2 list.

OK here's a question then, did the 67 and earlier have any noise reduction
in the engine department? I had a 60 in 1972 and I don't remeber any on that
one either. Maybe the Deluxes?
