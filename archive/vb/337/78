Subject: RE: [VB] classic insurance

I have all my drivable aircooled vws covered under American Family
Insurance.  They are all on a 'stated value' classic coverage and 10k
worth of coverage costs about $112 per year.

<matt asked>

Does anyone currenty have classic insurance on their Bus?  JC Taylor is
the only company that I am familiar with and they do not cover buses or
trucks.  I am looking to insure my 63 SO33.
