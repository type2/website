Hi,

Thanks for the reminder. I need to do this.

I just did a quick search, and several resources cautioned against the  
"stated amount/value" option because (1) this is the maximum that will  
be paid not exactly the amount that will be paid, (2) this option  
usually has a clause that stipulates, "or actual cash value" which is  
what the adjuster will use to settle your loss for an amount less than  
the stated amount.

They suggest using the "agreed amount/value" option. This isn't an  
option in some states, such as mine.

A good article:

BTW, I wonder how the car carrier is fairing after dropping a load of  
365s on the highway:
