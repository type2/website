Subject: Flywheel seal leak?

Dear mechanical people,

I rebuilt my 70 engine last year. It was running well before the rebuild
except for a massive oil leak.

New case, new cc'd heads new P&C's, full flow, powder coated tin, doghouse
conversion.

The new engine runs great except for a MASSIVE OIL LEAK.

When I took off the flywheel I saw oil dripping over the lower part of the
seal lip. The seal is an Elring of America made in ROC (China). The new seal
I bought is exactly the same seal and seems to be the only seal available in
the San Jose area.

Anyone have advice as to whether the seal is likely to go out again or if it
is even the source of the leak? The case behind the flywheel is completely
dry. Are better seals available?
Thanks,
Phil
70 type 2
