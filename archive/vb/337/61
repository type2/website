Hi Tracey,
Carbs should not be a pain to rebuild/clean, if they are, and they are not 
worn out then it is because one is inexperienced.  Best to learn and get the 
experience how to rebuild them now at home, than to have to learn somewhere out 
on a dark road one night when some crud blocks up a passage!
  As for the wiring.  The wire going to the positive side of the carb 
continues to the fuel shut off switch on the left of the carb and ends on the right 
side to the electric choke.
