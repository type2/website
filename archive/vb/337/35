Great  question. It is a potentially typical troubleshooting process. First
check  to confirm you have spark. Then confirm there is fuel. Statically time
the  distributor.

I put a carb on it, new point, new coil. It will start  after about a million
cranks, it revs, then dies. If I'm lucky it will stay  running until I get
back to the engine compartment before it dies. I'm a  mechanic just starting
in the field, so I know about the componunts, but  I'm still getting used to
all this. Does it sound like a carb issue, a  timing issue, any ideas?



check spark coming OUT of distributor as well as going IN.   :)  
 
 also check timing, 
plug wires on right.. 
tuneup kinda stuff.  
could be a cloggy carb issue
