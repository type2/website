Hello Tracy    First thing to do is either put on a remote starter button or 
run you a jumper wire to the starter so that you can start the motor while you 
are in the engine compartment. This way you can keep it running so you can 
test stuff.  Nothing worse than running all the way to the back just to have the 
motor die and you have to repeat it again. Check the idle jet on the carb and 
for vacuum leaks  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
