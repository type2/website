Take the plugs out and try it again (gently).  If you have a bunch of fluid
(water, gas, oil) in one of the cylinders, it can keep the engine from
moving - sometimes known as "hydro lock".  Taking the plugs out will let
you get most of the fluid out, if that's the problem... then you have to
figure out where it was coming from.
