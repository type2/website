Subject: winter is coming-heater question

Well I got this stewart-warner heater a while ago...(1 1/2 years?)

It has been sitting in my basement, but I think I am really going to get it
installed before this winter(I hope). I got some manuals on installation
etc...but it is missing some duct work-which I could probably
fabricate...but its also missing the switch-or whatever that controls it up
front. 

I just saw one for sale on thesamba-but it is for a eberspacher-does anyone
know if these are compatible?

Thanks,
