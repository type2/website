Subject: lil' pivoting window seal replacement

Anyone have any tips on replacing that seal.  I have my pivoting windows out
of the frames and now it's time to put them back together.  It looks like a
tough job.  I recall in the Bentley that there is some sort of press to get
that glass in there - but I don't have one of those - tips appreciated.

TIA
