Greasy Volks,

My daughter and I just got back from a trip to B.C., Canada, where we
intended to ride the Kettle Valley Rail Trail on bikes-- 182 miles.  But
the weather was rainy and we didn't want to slog through rain, mud and
cold weather, so we headed back down to Coeur d'Alene and did the 72
mile paved trail up and back.  

On the way, we deliberately stopped at Coeur to go to the famous
Vertical Earth bike shop on 3rd St. to get Heather a pair of waterproofs
to go over her shoes while riding.  Got the surpise of my life when we
turned the corner, as Vertical's  neighber is a VW shop.  The corner is
a parking lot and next to that is the VW shop, then Vertical Earth.  The
lot had a Bay single and double cab, along with a splittie DC, all
unrestored, but in VG condition.  Next to them was a NICELY done oval,
in light tan.  A real  beauty.  Who is this, anyone know?I didn't know
there was anything VWise up there.

Coeur is God's playground, esp. since they got rid of the White
Supremists in Hayden.  We saw and got digital pictures of wild turkey,
deer and moose, along with osprey and blue heron.  I was too scared to
approach the bear we saw in Canada.  That goes for the Canadian Cougar
too.  I forgot to take pictures of the Bays and splitty.  Rats!

PLV,
