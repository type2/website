Subject: Alaskan '65 & Folk Artist

He is an Alaskan folk? artist that travels
around in his '65 bus. His CD back includes 
a photo of himself standing in front of it.

He was in town recently and I heard him on
our local community radio station and have
heard his great music. I love his piano style.

Here's a description from 
http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/davemanning

"Like a Tom Waits Wanna-be meets a clandestine 
Bruce Springsteen impersonator and they get 
together with Kris Kristoferson to try to change 
the engine in a '65 VW Microbus."

I have put him on my birthday/Christmas list.

The CD baby site allows you to listen to a few
of his songs.

They provide a way to email him, so I extended
an invite to this email list.
