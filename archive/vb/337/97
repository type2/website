Subject: Help locating an engine

Well, since I offered up one kind of engine to a fellow listee the other 
day, maybe that bit of karmic good will help me in my search.  I know 
its almost sacreligious to speak of things not T2, but I'm really in need.

I'm looking for a good running T 3...yes I said T3 long block in the 
Southern CA area.  I'd perfer a SP motor, but a DP will do.  All I need 
is the LB, but if someone has a complete one I'd take it.  Will pay a 
fair price and of course will come and get it.  

So all you closet T3 parts horders out there help a brotha out.  I need 
to get my commuter car up and running :-)  Oh BTW I have been driving my 
'62 crew to Burbank and back (70miles in L.A. traffic) to OC for a 
while, but after a few close calls, I'd like something more, shall we 
say, expendable ;-)

TIA!!

Steve
