Subject: Flywheel seal leak?

Did you change the flywheel o-ring? That may have been your original cause 
of leaking. Likewise are the mating surfaces on the crank and flywheel in 
good shape? Is the end-play correct? All dowels present? Gland nut washer 
present?

is even the source of the leak? The case behind the flywheel is completely
dry. Are better seals available?
