Subject: Re: [VB] 65' Splitty single port, redid alot, no start, help

Great question. It is a potentially typical troubleshooting process. First
check to confirm you have spark. Then confirm there is fuel. Statically time
the distributor.

I put a carb on it, new point, new coil. It will start after about a million
cranks, it revs, then dies. If I'm lucky it will stay running until I get
back to the engine compartment before it dies. I'm a mechanic just starting
in the field, so I know about the componunts, but I'm still getting used to
all this. Does it sound like a carb issue, a timing issue, any ideas?
