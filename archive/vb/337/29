I have one... you just need a tranny bellhousing to bolt to the motor
starter of desired Voltage installed in bell housing with correct  bushing.
I have a ground strap bolted to the bell housing to go to the - of the  
battery
hot strap from + on starter to + on battery, thyat strap also has a long  wir 
eto reach the coil.
cross the starter terminals to turn engine round.
 
oh, you also need some fuel line and a can of gas to feed the motor.
Thinking it'd be nice to have a second one to hold a 6V starter, I ran into  
a couple tranny bits but passed them on a couple years ago.
