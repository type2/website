Subject: helphos spotlight info.

Hi Folks,
Sorry to use the bandwidth. I can't recall the name of the fella I spoke
with earlier except he was at one of these these sites. Was hoping to pass
this to him If this info also applys to you please feel free to use it.
A few months ago I purchased a HELPHOS spot light.
Although not VOLKSWAGON specific they sold it as an accessary for busses,
bugs to I believe. If you have a copy of the bus part manual look in main
group 9,
page 9-38, illustration 53, item 65 and 66.
It's a neat light. Use as a spot light wired into your cars electric
system, or use a cigarette lighter plug device. 6 volt or 12 depending on the
bulb.
Mounts to the windshield of the bug or bus with a vacuum device, really nice.
Anyway big problem is the bulbs. Not made anymore! Wanted to let anyone
who might have one of these guys know a fella in California has come across a
bunch of the original bulbs, N.O.S., both 12 and 6 volt! In Australia, I
believe.
If your interested contact him at
joker4evr(-at-)sbcglobal.net      His name is Mark Mendez

hope this will be usefull to someone,
Mike Turner
