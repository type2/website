I took about 325 photos at Jerome and am formatting them (as time permits) and
will burn a copy onto CD for both the AzBusClub webmaster and for the
newsletter editor.
I will advise and contact them via pmail. Please stand-by...

< in the mean time look at the Samba Gallery for a few images as they become
available.>

Of course the good ones will eventually be on the Arizonabusclub.com! =)
Thanks to all who attended.
