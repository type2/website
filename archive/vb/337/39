Funny you should mention oil pressure. Sometimes when I start the engine the
oil pressure "pegs"at 70 psi on the VDO gage and sticks there. It then drops
off to about 40 psi. Acts like the pressure relief or something is hanging
up.

I do have the red seal (Elring of America made in ROC) which seems to be
what everyone sells. I think its silicon.

I think my problem was not polishing the flywheel sealing surface well
enough. There was a small pit and shallow grooves,marks which I have now
polished out. And the new seal seems to fit the polished suface with enough
interference to seal.
