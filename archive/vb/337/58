Subject: Help with tranny from 64 into 59

I am try to mount a tranny from a 64 bus to a 59 single.  I purchase one of
those nose cone mounts to adapt it to the 59.  Today I noticed the mount is
not going to line up, because the top rib on the nosecone is hitting the top
of the 59's round mount.  Does this make sense? Anyway, I know I am going to
have to do some trimming.  Do I trim the top out of the round mount on the
bus, or do I trim down the rib on the nosecone of the tranny?

Please Help.

Thanks
