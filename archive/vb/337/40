This isn't uncommon at all. Even with a brand new fresh case, often the
piston can hang up in the hole, or the sealing surface is not square with
the top of the piston allowing oil pressure loss even though the engine is
fresh. There is a specific tool avaliable to resurface this area of the
case:

Often times people install those heavier springs in the engine case to make
up for low oil pressure at idle, which isn't even addressing the real
problem.
