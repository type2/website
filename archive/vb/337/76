   Matt here's the link to the schematic, I'm using the second diagram(coil
 connection):  http://www.globalserve.net/~jrivers/aux-batt.htm I have
 checked and rechecked my hook up and all is correct.  As I first stated
with
 the #87 wire to the aux. batt. disconnected at the batt. it has power when
 the key is 'on', the fuse does not blow, and no power when the key is
'off'.
 When I attach the #87 wire to the pos. post and turn the key on the fuse
 blows right away.  I've charged the aux. and it is fine not internally
 shorted, it powers lights etc. just fine.  Also the aux. batt. is just one
 yr. old, I realize that doesn't matter but it does hold a charge fine.
 Thanks for your help Matt,
   Lou & Lis

  I'm not sure where the fuse is in this circuit, but one possibility may
 be that one of your batteries is fairly low.  When the two batteries are
 connected together, the good one tries to charge the low one, and if the
 low one is low enough, the high charging current might blow a fuse.  (The
 wiring is supposed to limit the current flow between the two batteries,
 but if one is really discharged for some reason, the wire might not
 provide enough current limiting.)

 After the Bus has been sitting for a while, check the voltage right at the
 terminals of both the aux battery and the regular battery.  You want to see
12.6 volts or so.
 If one battery is much lower than this, charge it
 up (by running the engine above idle, or with a battery charger) and try
 the connection again.

 If you can point me to an online copy of the schematic/wiring diagram, I
 might be able to give a more detailed answer.
