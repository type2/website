Subject: re:upgrading heating

i have a '65 kombi. which as i understand it is the basic/working version of
the van. my heating vents are only in the front-nothing for the back seats.
i often hear that the heat in buses sucks. i have never understood this-the
heat on mine pours out pretty strong, and also pretty hot. i have the
original tube that runs the length of the bus, with the original insulating
blanket. i have contemplated adding more insulation where there is none-some
of the pipes don't have any-and they look like they never did.

my bus is an ez-camper conversion, so it has curtains behind the front
seats(non walkthru). so in the colder temps i just close the curtains, and
the front "cab" warms up. not super hot, but it warms up. i may put
insulation behind the front panels to help this. i can actually feel a
pretty distinct temp difference if i reach my hand into the back seat to
reach for anything through the curtain. i have contemplated adding one of
those solid panels, with the window in it, not sure what they are called, so
i could fully seal the front cabin.

i guess due to the fact that I don't have the rear heater-i get the added
pressure up front.

not sure if this helps anyone, but just thought i would add some more info
in.
