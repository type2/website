Subject: looking for history on 1965 Deluxe CA reg NJL306

Sorry if this is inappropriate for the list.

We have just bought this bus in England, and would like to get in touch with any
former keepers to get some history on the bus, the last registration (march
2001) showed the keeper as Doss Thomas Hartley in Oakland.

The bus is seablue/blue white in original paint, in great condition, and has a
superb t3 engine, and runs great, looks like it had new tyres, and some engine
cleanup fairly recently, so hope someone on the list might have some info.
Please email me with any info, previous owners or ideas, thanks.

Thanks,
