Subject: re:replacing front rubber

sounds like you have all the bases covered-i might suggest a heat gun-to
insure that the metal is nice and dry before you put any type of paint on.
just a short blast. because you need to rinse the metal after the metal
ready with water-and then you need to dry. unlessyou are in a much warmer
climate where things are drying ontheir own (kind of like here in august)
try the heat gun. obviously not too much don't want to peal the good paint
off....
