Subject: Re: [VB] Stud size vs head type

I had 10mm studs in my H cased single port 1600 and they pulled out. 
The studs were even anchored with threaded inserts. I installed 
oversized threaded inserts and 8mm studs. The 8mm studs and oversized 
inserts are working great. Apparently the 8mm studs grow at the same 
rate as the cylinders when heated and the 10mm studs do not. As far as 
I know you can use the 8mm studs with a AH case
