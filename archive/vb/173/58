To some extent I agree - it's just not real smart to try and steal the
lenses from a pair of big oval tail lights.  But if early turn signals
really do go for $80+ a pop, you might find someone willing to really
take the time on it.  At some point, though, it is better for them to
steal your turn signals than steal your whole Bus.

http://www.tamperproof.com/products.html has this and other popular
"security" screws.

I still stand by my statement: With a Dremel tool and a cut-off wheel,
_everything_ takes a flat-blade screwdriver.  :)
