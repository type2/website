Subject: RE: [VB] WANTED: Pickup rear bumper

  So, did you buy it or are you still thinking of it?  With all the problems
and wrong/missing parts that this bus has, I think there are much better
deals out there. 
  My 63 westy has 70,000 original miles and it drives as new. My new 60
single cab with unknown miles drives great. My 15 window rust and all drives
great except for the 40hp in it (slow). 
  It definitally sounds like the bus you are LOOKING at is being
misrepresented and is a high milage or very abussed SC.

The reason I thought that the truck must have a different bumper is because
of the way the rear corners of the body are shaped (rather more square than
a bus - the inner 'battery floors' are different due to this).  The gap
between the body corners and the bumper narrow down to only 1/4" or so at
the very corner.  It doesn't look right to my eye.

But if it's really true...


Does anyone have a nice rear bumper to sell, complete w/ overriders and
bows?

THANKS!
