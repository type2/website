Hi Thomas,
String tends to act as a saw and cut the rubber.  About 14 gauge automotive 
wire works much better due to not doing this and not tearing off the new 
paint on the window frame!
  Best to sand and use phosperic acid (Naval Jelly from your local hardware 
store work well.) in turns.  Food plastic wrap layed over rhe acid keeps it 
from drying out and working longer (Like overnight!).  Plus the acid will rid 
the rust you have in pits in the metal.  Once you are doen with the acid wipe 
it off and let it dry.  Give the area a good sanding after drying and only 
then you can zinc primer.  Otherwise the high content zinc primer will bubble 
badly when it reacts to the phosperic acid.  If you want you can use a body 
shop degreaser wash, but NOT water to rinse of the acid or you will have just 
started the rust back up again!  Make sure the zinc primer you use has at 
least 85% zinc content.
