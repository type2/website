Subject: Heater box rattle Q

Now that my motor is apart, I have german heater boxes that need a small
hole welded, and a good cleanup. The DASNK ones just dont have good
heat IMHO. But, the german ones outer metal can move slightly. Is this
normal, or is something wrong? My dansk ones do not do this.
