Subject: Re: [VB] Repro taillights.

sounds like I made a mistake ordering then but I need the lights! Problem is I was going to fix the
existing ones but they are way too rusted to be saved. Glass is broken in half on both and the only
items I could save were seals and chrome rings..... not too pretty but still there. Paying almost 50
green ones for each is not small change either. I could of probably gotten some used ones off eBarf
or Samba but I didn't want to wait. I don't want someone to park in my rear just because my lights
are out... I'm thinking.... should I wait then? all I hear is bad experiences with repro ones.....

thanks,
