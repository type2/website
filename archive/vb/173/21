Subject: Upgraded heating

Question that I have concerns heating in my Bus. As some might already know heat tube in the rear of
my Bus was cut off so I'm thinking now about bringing it back... does anyone know if I can upgrade
and install the newer style tube out of a Bay window? Is there enough room to install some kind of a
booster motor? I've seen those motors available through part suppliers and got the idea - install
tube from a Bay and install a blower somewhere right there under the seat.         .... any idea if
that can be done? Extra heater - I know.... but that's extra, extra work.

thanks,

Dre
