Subject: Vent Weatherstrip Help

I'm trying to install a new WW vent window weatherstrip seal that is 3-sided 
and fits into the window frame. Argh! After having success with the front 
screens, I thought I could do this, too. Is there any trick? Should I start 
at the top or bottom? There is a precut hole for the latch, but not for the 
bar that attaches w/a rivet. Guess I gotta cut one, eh? Anyway how do I get 
this thing in--I see that the two big rubber strips go in the center channel 
on the frame....but it just doesn't want to seat properly.
