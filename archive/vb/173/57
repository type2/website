My '64 appears fairly original underneath and not all of its pipes are
insulated either.  The "Y" at the back isn't, and the place at the very
front where it dodges around the control linkages and turns to go up
through the floor isn't either.

Right.  Since you don't have the rear heater vent, each of your heat
exchangers is connected to one leg of the Y, so you get the output of
both heat exchangers up front.  On my Bus, only one of the heat exchangers
is connected to the Y, and the other leg of the Y is capped off.  The other
heat exchanger serves the rear heat vent.
