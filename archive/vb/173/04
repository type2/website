Subject: re: i just love surprises

was writ:I bought several sizes of hollow brass tube and made hollow drills
to cut
the small tight tolerance holes.

this sounds like a great idea, i had never heard before, i assume the point
of using a tube instead of a drill bit is due to drill bits chewing
material.

could you just use the brass tubes as punches?
