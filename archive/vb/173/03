Subject: RE: [VB] Replacing front rubber. Zinc primer 1st?

I'm using the zinc primer for two reasons.  One I have it at hand and two,
not all the metal that ends up bare will be covered in POR-15 so it will
essentially be zinc primer on bare metal too.  I don't think the POR-15
would adhere to primer as well as etched metal.

Regards,

Thomas

Why bother with zinc primer on top of the POR15? The zinc is supposed to be
used on bare metal. That is why it is called cold galvanize compound.
