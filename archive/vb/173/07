In the beginning of august the original nose cone mount broke, it sheared
the metal plate the transmission bolts to from the rubber. I replaced the
nosecone mount and the 2 rear mounts with OE style mounts . I bought the OE
ones from a shop that sales quality, they said that they were the only brand
they could get.
About a week later I'm crawling around under the truck and notice the nose
cone mount has broke. that same metal plate had started to break loose . By
the time I parked it to do the recent work it had broken completely.
I don't really care for the urethane mounts, they are just a pain in the but
, but I don't want to have to pull everything again to replace the mounts, I
cant afford to have my work truck out this long again.
I know a dude with a  panel and he runs the red mounts. He probably doesn't
work his panel to death like I do my truck but he says that the mounts work
fine.
