Subject: The Nose & Valance Seam

Hi folks,
This is the first email I've sent to this list so I'm
not sure if this is an unusual question, although it
probably is.
I'm FINALLY rebuilding my 67 Panel & I bought it from
another guy as an unfinished project.
As such, things like(any vintage purists had probably
best avert their eyes at this point) the ball joint
front end & IRS rear conversions had already been done
and done well mind you.
He'd also cut out some rust, including a 4 to 5 inch
high strip right across the front behind the bumper
where of course all Splits rust.
In the process, as many of you would already be saying
to yourself, he also cut out the flange on seam
between nose panel & the front valance.
I spoke to my panel beater today & he asked if I
wanted him to fabricate a new one.
He's worked on many VWs & he says that he can't see
that it will affect anything apart from from the
originality of the bus.
Is this true?
Does that lip/flange actually serve a purpose other
than being the seam?
I'd love to have some good opinions on this.
It seems small(ha,ha, a pun) but if it's responsible
for stopping water gathering in other places, or for
that matter, it MAKES water gather there & creates
rust, then I'd like to know.
You can check out the bus if you like on my site under

I'll be thankful for any pointers.
:o)
Cheers
Andy
