Subject: Re: [VB] The Nose & Valance Seam

IMHO... do whatever suites you. If this piece was cut out you can replace it
with a piece from a donor Bus. It's hard to find a good non rusted lower
nose on a Bus that is otherwise pretty much gone. As far as the lip goes? I
don't think it serves any purpose other joining lower, upper and inner
pieces of sheetmetal. If your bodyman can replicate this piece, tell him to
start producing these and other "Most wanted" sheet metal pieces.

As long as you're happy with it, go for it. To some this might sound like an
invitation to turn these Busses of ours upside-down but really, it's your
Bus...... do as you'd like as long as it works and looks decent.

PS... I wish I had a bodyman like this here in Chitown. He could fix my
Busses nose too.....

peace,
