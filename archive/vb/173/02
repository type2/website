No No No!  Use the Metal Ready on roughed up bare metal, rinse after 15
minutes, then the POR, then a good quality sandable primer at the 2 hour
point. Let dry/cure for at least a half day. THen apply your body filler
or sandable primer to prepare for your topcoat.

The zinc primers that are generally offered to consumers are wimpy and
lame, and don't really work. The POR does stop rust on the surface it's
applied to, and if the surface is prepped properly (follow directions),
it'll all work out well.
