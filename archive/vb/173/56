I have seen some cars with blowers plumbed into the fresh air hoses
between the fan shroud and the heater boxes.  That way the blowers
are on the "cold" side.  I think the later Bus blowers worked the
same way; they blew air into the heat exchangers at the same point
as the hoses from the fan shroud.  Once the engine was above a fast
idle, the engine fan provided most of the air through the heat
exchangers.
