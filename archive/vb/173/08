could you just use the brass tubes as punches?
--------------------------
I'd say you could.
I only wanted to do the job once so I chucked up the short tubes, held a
file against the tube end/edge and sharpened it. I just possibly made a
cleaner cut.
Most of the holes could have been made with a leather punch, you know the
kind with the rotating punch wheel. 
Well, I didn't have one and good ones are expensive, over $40.00
I didn't want a cheap one so I opted for the tubing from the hobby
section of the Ace Hardware.
With the cheap Chinese products coming in every day you might get a
decent set of gasket cutters for under 20$.
Nice thing about the gasket cutters is that you get a square corner
clipper and a couple of elongated holes too.
