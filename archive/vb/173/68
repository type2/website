That's what I figure my security screws are for. I doubt the average thief
is carrying a battery powered Dremel, and the beeping proximaty alarm in
the bus is going off constantly as he struggles to use his longnose pliers
to unscrew both screws.

Worse comes to worse, I've got OEM spares I bought 20 years ago.

Who knows?
