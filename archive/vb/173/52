Subject: Re: [VB] Back on list w/ a fine(?) vehicle!

I would say that it sounds like a lot of "damage" for a 26,000 vehicle ,
however we have to remember that this was a work vehicle and was probably
treated as such. my single cab gets a new dent in the bed every day , and if
it had nice paint it would probably have new scratches as well. Perhaps your
truck does have the stated miles and it was rear ended . It doesn't really
matter though, just drive it, don't worry about the price, if your satisfied
then so be it.
