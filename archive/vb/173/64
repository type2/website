Craig- This sounds just like the ferschlugginner case
you spent hundreds of hours ( ? ) and dollars on.
It's time for a review of that Hot VW article, and your
report from Rimco regarding your case in particular.
I was curious that you had mentioned having the
new case mic'd before you found the defect. Why ?
