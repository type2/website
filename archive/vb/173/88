Subject: AridZona Full Length Bus Rack

Has anyone bought a full length Tom Conner Rack or can vouch for its
accuracy to the original VW ones (the ones that used the horseshoe style
clamps). Also if you did buy one how did the shipping work out?

As well any idea where I can score a spray can (or touch up paint) or L472-
aka Beige Grey. I bought a touch up bottle of L472 from paintscratch.com and
the colour id hardly even close. Their L53 (sealing wax red) was very close
but beige grey is waaay off. I should add that I already looked through
wolfsburgwest.com and couldn't find L472

Thanks

M.
