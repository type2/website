Hi Dre,
Just get the heating system back to stock.  The booster kits have plastic 
fans which usually melt when pumping hot air.  If you find you need more hot 
air check into a wider cooling fan and a Porsche generator pulley to up the 
fan RPM.  If you still need more heat invest in a gas heater.
