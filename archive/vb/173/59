Subject: junkyard find

Hunting for a 113 101 371F 40hp head today, no luck, but I did find something
else. An intake manifold 111 129 701E, 36hp I think, with some interesting bits
attached: VW Solex carb 1858682 (no PICT nothing), intake manifold support
bracket thingy, and a very cool tube that runs beneath and clamps to the
manifold and keeps the spark plug wires out of harms way. Anybody putting
together an early engine who can put this stuff to good use, let me know.
Anyone have a good 113 101 371F for me? I'm trying not to use the one with the
missing cooling fins... Thanks.
