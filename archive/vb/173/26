Listees...

Here's something that folks who are mounting rare collectable taillights
and front turn signals will want to look at - tamper-proof screws.

In my restoration back in 94, I was ordering a lot of material from
McMaster-Carr Co., and had their hard-to-get catalog available.

They sell a large variety of tamper-proof fasteners/screws, and it seemed
like the thing to do, with turn sigs going for $80 each. The screws I
chose for mounting the front turnsigs and taillights are the flat-headed,
stainless steel, drilled-spanner types. Here's how to get to see and
order them from McMaster's online:

Go to:

http://www.mcmaster.com/    and search for the word 'tamper', then click
on  'Other entries with the word "Tamper" ' and then click on
'Tamper-Resistant Screws'

Scroll down to the DRIVE STYLE section, choose a style (I recommend the
Tamper-Resistant Drilled Spanner), and click.
I used the Tamper-Resistant Drilled Spanner, Flat Head, 18-8
Stainless Steel, 8-32 Thread size, 1" length, Part Number  94063A199.

They thread nicely into the existing taillight assemblies and front turn
sigs, at least on the '67 they do. They require the use of a matching
tool, and mine use the -

Part Number  94062A116
Drilled Spanner Driver For #8 Screw Sz, 3-1/4" Blade Lg, 8-1/2" O'all Lg
$ 8.28 Each,   which you find by searching on their site for 'tamper' and
following the links to 'Tamper-Resistant Drivers & Nutdrivers'.

I got really anal about the whole thing, and welded up the slots in the
heads of the large headlight screws, and pan-headed them out on a lathe,
then drilled matching holes for the same driver-tool. Then of course, I
POR'ed the heads and holes so they wouldn't rust!

Okay, just figured it's time for this essay!  Keep your early taillights
from walking away in the night!
