Hi Paul,
Take the beam the rest of the way apart and clean out all the old grease in 
the beam tubes.  Then peer through the beam like when cleaning a gun barrel 
and look for rust.  If the rust is contained to the immeadtiate area of the 
hole you probably can have it welded up.  If it spread all over it is 
probably best to get a new beam.  BTW what year beam is it?  If needed we 
probably have an extra one here.
