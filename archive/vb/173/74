Subject: Re: [VB] WANTED: Pickup rear bumper

The reason I thought that the truck must have a different bumper is because
of the way the rear corners of the body are shaped (rather more square than
a bus - the inner 'battery floors' are different due to this).  The gap
between the body corners and the bumper narrow down to only 1/4" or so at
the very corner.  It doesn't look right to my eye.

But if it's really true...


Does anyone have a nice rear bumper to sell, complete w/ overriders and bows?

THANKS!
