  Randy Carlson from oldbugs.com, also has/had a company called AWINNI
(spelling) that manufactured HULA GIRLS, not some generic plastic skirted
girl but a real porcelain? babe.
  You might want to give hima call and see if he still makes them

Does anyone know what happened to the company that was at 
www.bobbinhead.net?  There was a discussion on the list a while back about 
some great quality Hula girls that they were selling.   At the time I 
bookmarked the sight.  Last night I bought a 59 Singlecab that is screaming 
to have a hula girl in it, but I go to the sight and it is no longer there.

:(

Any help on finding this sight would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
