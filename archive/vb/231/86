Cool pic !

I have been looking for old VWs iin the Iraqui war pictures.    About ten 
years ago I met a friend from Somalia and one who was Saudi who both loved my 
bus cause it reminded them of the VWs around when they were kids.  Evidently 
there were loads of them.  How many dealerships did VW have in the middle 
East and N Africa in the sixties?
