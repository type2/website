Subject: RE: [VB] oil temp gauge

Hi,
I found amongst my myriad bits an oil temp sensor that
is set up to be mounted in the oil drainage plug in
the sump plate.
I already have a similar set up on my 2.0l engine in
my '77 bus where the sender is mounted on the dummy
plate on the bottom of the case.
The plug I found has been drilled and tapped to fit
the sensor as you can see in the pic below:

The only problem that I can see is that the oil
strainer won't fit flush with it there.
Can I modify the strainer to fit the sender or will
this alter the effectiveness of the strainer
drastically?
If so, could someone post a pic of this particular
plate that is mentioned below.
