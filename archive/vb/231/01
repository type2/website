That would be a type 3 or universal case, like what the new aluminum ones
are.

LJ,

If your engine case has a small block-off plate with two nuts, in the
right rear corner, to the right of the oil pump, then you can mount your
sender either on the plate, drilling it to match, or get a matching plate
already drilled. Mine's been there for 29 years. Works fine.

Welcome to the wonederful world of bussing! And the list!
