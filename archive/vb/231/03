In the context of a '67 Bus...

Aftermarket flasher relay:
  + Will probably be rated to handle the load
  + Simple to wire
  + Available at most auto parts stores
  + Should provide full original functionality for a Euro-spec Bus
  - May not provide full functionality in a US-spec Bus

Relay conversion kit:
  + Should provide full original functionality for a US-spec Bus

  - May not be rated to handle the load (it will work, but the parts
    are being used beyond their specifications)
  - Slightly more complex to wire
  - May only be available at VW shops
  - Some use diodes in the lamp circuits, making the lamps dimmer

If your '67 is a US-specification Bus, this is probably true.  Originally
it would have had the "nine prong box" which combines a flasher and some
relays to implement the turn signal and hazard warning functions.  This
is generally replaced by a conversion kit; there are a couple of different
designs for these kits.

If you don't want or need the hazard light function, the 9-prong box
can be replaced with an aftermarket flasher and a jumper wire.   This
will give you turn signals, but no hazards.

If your '67 is a Euro-specification Bus, then this is probably true.
Stock, it has a simpler and more common three-terminal flasher.  If the
original part isn't available, there are aftermarket flashers that should
fit and work just fine.

My answer: Build your own.  :)

You might also want to use the "Troubleshooting" directions in that
article to decide if the trouble is in the flasher relay or elsewhere.
Burned out bulbs, poor grounds at the lamps (especially the rear ones),
trouble in the turn signal switch, or a bad hazard light switch can
all make your turn signal / hazard system not work right.
