Subject: Follow the bouncing bus

My '65 really tends to hop starting off in 1st, especially if I'm going over a bump at the same time.  And speed bumps make me sproingy.

I thought I had done the bounce test but I'll re-check it.  I compressed and telescoped the rear shocks while the tranny was out and they had plenty 
of damping left in them, no leaks.  I know splits tend to hop on accel (or at least mine have) but I want to minimize this.

Searching the archives it sounds like HD Boges are my best bet: highway, round town, a little dirt roading; stock engine, conservative driving.  I'd 
appreciate hearing conflicting advice on that.

Dealing with the tires next....it has a set of 195/14s on it, and I know I can improve that sitch.
