  The ordeal is almost over, what you ask? Getting a container through
customs, that's what. Due to a UNION squabble at the port because the
shipping company decided to change piers my container has been held up at
the port for over a week. One piers union rep didn't like the fact that the
shipping line changed piers with-out UNION approval which created a
nightmare at the piers.. Ship moved out of one pier to another then back, a
real mess.
  Today customs put their long arm of the law down and threatened the
dockworkers (UNION) that they better get their shit together and get the
containers to customs for inspection, by 4 O'clock today or else, 
   The irony of this whole deal is I got a break-down on the import duties
and  had to pay more duty on 2 westfalia trailer hitchs then I did on my new
Firebus, go figire.  I won't talk about the High roof and Eriba puck, I'll
let the new owner do that.

ronnie  almost happy again
