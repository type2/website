Ouch! You guys paying $2.25 for gas? I just filled up this morning for a
$1.63.9 and last week it was $165.9 and ARCO/AM-PM. I guess the prices are
coming down back closer to reality everywhere but CA. A friend of mine in
Worland WY was complaining that gas prices were too high there also. He's had
to pay $1.12.9 for months now and he's not liking it one bit. Poor baby. Wish
I had his bad luck!

Round trip from newark to wilmington is almost 50 gallons of gas! (figuring 16
MPG and using Yhaoo.maps), so your looking at $110 alone for gas! $2.25 a
gallon at Am/Pm!I guess you could take a HONDA instead of a bus.   Sean65
