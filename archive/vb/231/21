Subject: re:pop out window frames

I sand blasted mine, and then spray painted. The potential problems with
powder coating the frames, is that where you most need the coating, it may
not actually stick. This has something to do with the grooves being so small
that there is some static interference potentially causing the podwer out of
the grooves that the glass goes in....

ask your powdercoater what he thinks...

I think I have also seen these aluminum ones, that you can get
anodized...don't klnow a lot about them, but they might be worth looking
into, if you have not purchased the others already....I think they are made
by CE.
