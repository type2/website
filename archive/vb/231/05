Thanks for all the replies last week on my question about Safari's. Seems 
like most vote for CE's. Never did hear from anyone though when/if Izzy's was 
coming back. I have a pair on a '67 from a couple of years ago, and they work 
quite well.

No one mentioned Wolfgang's. If I calculate the exchange rate correctly, it 
looks like theirs are a lot cheaper then the CE's. Besides it seems CE has 
their problems also, plus everyone's leak! 

Any opinions?

Jerry
p.s. No one ever got back to me about my 428 "M" code and what it was.
