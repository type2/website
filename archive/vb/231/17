Subject: Turn signal 66

Hello All,
Have I read that it is almost impossible to get the turn signal switch??
I believe I am in need of the "whatchmacallit",,, the switch that connects
to the fuse panel,,,the little blinker box.  Maybe even another signal lever
assembly.

Thank you for putting up with my "technical" jargon.
