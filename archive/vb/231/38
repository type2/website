Sean,

I just aquired a trailer similar to yours and Ronnie's aswell.  The wheel
bearings are pretty standard and are the same as the wheel bearings in other
trailers.  I found a set at NAPA autoparts.  Just take your old ones and
they will be able to hook you up.  If you can't find them let me know and
I'll find you a set down here.

Let me know if I can help,
Aaron

It is the same style that Ronnie has. Any info appreciated, thanks. Sean
