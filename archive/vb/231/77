Hi Russ,
With enough pressure it could have been just shoved in there.....

ID of six volt bushing .494", twelve volt is .436".

With engine removed, inspect clutch and grease input needle bearings and 
measure and inspect bushing for wear proper fit.

Probably needs more clearance.  Try turning the engine by hand while 
installing the engine.  Personally we prefer using a six volt starter with a 
twelve volt solinoid and 6 volt toothed 200mm FW. No clearance problems.  
Turn the key in -6F weather and it starts right up!  Plus in emergencies the 
bus can be walked in first gear to get it out of the way if the engine dies.  
Also lots of six volt starters out there since everyone dumps them.

Certainly!
