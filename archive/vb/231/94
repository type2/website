>remembering gas station giveaways and gimmicks

I have a full set of bronze presidential coins personally collected at Shell stations in the late 60s.  Goes all the way through Nixon. :-)  And of course a 
Chevron convertible beetle from the commercials done by Aardman (or copying the style of Creature Comforts, Wallace & Grommit, etc.).  Now there's 
a collecting niche: gas station promos with VW themes.

A local gas station/convenience store is run by a bunch of guys from Lebanon who are all related.  They love my buses!  They too have lots of 
memories -- apparently there were a lot of unregistered taxis along the seashore that were buses.

Hmm - an aardman bus with "Ahmed's Seashore Taxi" on the side.....
