Subject: RE: [VB] Mystery VIN

  I have seen partial vin numbers stamped in the bottoms of window frames in
BD's and have been told that the doors etc. also are stamped (Porsche 356
stamped the last 2 or 3 numbers of the vin on most removable parts). Is your
a early 56?

Maybe it was an asset/rental/fleet number if this was a commercial vehicle,
or a 
builders number if it was a camper? Maybe some states require it stamped in
that 
location. Just guessing.
