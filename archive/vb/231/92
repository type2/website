Subject: Re [VB] vintage antenna toppers

WHA!?!? Are you kidding? You can't put an NOS vintage antenna topper on an 
antenna! Next your gonna tell me your gonna dirty the inside of the '59 DC's 
engine with motor oil! Oh the horror.
BTW - Your gonna be upset when some loser nicks it. I was when my Moon Antenna 
topper in the shape of an iron cross was, and it wasn't even vintage!
