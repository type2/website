Subject: Re: [VB] tow hitch, westy

I remember watching him as we were neighbors that day.  He didn't look
too happy at times ;-)  I guess you're right but you need small hands. 
I have a filter and just don't bother cleaning the screen.  My motor has
only 7K on a all new case/crank etc. so I'm not worried about it.
