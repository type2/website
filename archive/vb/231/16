 1st question-- How much movement of the transmission shaft (I want to call
 this the input shaft) is acceptable??  With the engine removed, I can take
 this shaft and move it around 1/8 ", maybe a little more.  Is that normal??
 It seems like a lot to me, but I don't know.

they always wiggle a little.    Turn the shaft, it should be smooth.  If it 
sounds rumbly that's bad.

 2nd question--How difficult is it to remove the Gland nut?   Reading Muir,
 it looks like a major undertaking.  Can you do it with hand tools or is it
 like the nuts on the rear axel??

easier that rear axle nuts, can be done with hand tools.  often helps to have 
a friend stand on the engine when you undo the nut.  if you need that, the 
nut was put on too tight.
