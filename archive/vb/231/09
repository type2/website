I've been going through my bits that I inherited
through purchasing a couple of different buses as well
as a heap of stuff that was clogging up another guy's
garage.
I found a couple of different coils.
One was a Bosch 12volt model with VW markings and the
number 9 220 061 100.
Another more puzzling one was a HANSH/N 12volt coil
with very little markings and no moddle number to be
seen.
As well I found an oil covered vacuum advance
distributor with vw markings & the numbers 0 231 180
001 on its side.
Can anyone enlighten me on when they were used and on
which engines.
If anyone can come up with info on the HANSH/N there
may be a little prize for the best answer from the
up-coming Australian VW Nationals which are over the
coming Easter Weekend.
Lookout for some pics from the show in the coming
week.
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
