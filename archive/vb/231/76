Hi John,
Best to check the voltage drop or ohm resistance first then start replacing 
parts.  We knew of one VW Wabbit owner who had starter problems.  He replaced 
the starter, then the battery, followed by the alternator, only finally to 
fix it by replacing the faulty battery ground strap!  So in other words the 
ground strap cost him about $300.00 in new parts.
