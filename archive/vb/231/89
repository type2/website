Subject: shock length

Hi All, 

 

Anyone know the length that the front shocks need to be able to compress
to on a 59 bus with flipped spindles (wolfgang), fully bottomed out?
GregB or any of you other dumpitontheground fans know?  I should have
figured this out when the front beam was out and fully disassembled.

 

 

 

David
