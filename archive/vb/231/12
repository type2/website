Hi Ray,
Smalest is 40 HP, the next size up is 1500- SP 1600, biggest was for DH 
engines.  Personally especially for bus we would only use the last one.  We 
wish someone could find the 40 HP bus larger pulley 211 105 251 (See section 
M-6. page 6 of the workshop manual.) still sealed in its # packaging for a 
known size, that was put on by the VW dealers to help with the increased 
load!
