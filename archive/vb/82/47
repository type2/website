Hey Rex,

For some reason I thought you wanted to go with a Bus IRS tranny?  Which I
have not seen a kit at all, only bug IRS trannies.

Both of the below mentioned kits use the bug IRS tranny with early bay
'68-'71 brakes and swing plates.

Unfortunately the webpages do not go into much detail on the specifics of
the kit such as Bus Boys does, so I have no idea what parts they are trying
to use.  Granted the Kruizinwagon kit seems pretty complete for a reasonable
price!

BUT I am not sure of the design of the kits.  I question that with stock
height the CVs will not bind up.  Bus Boys seems to have really taken the
time to address that concern with custom axles (or claimed custom, mebbe T3
or Thing?) and the T4 CVs.  Also the bus boys kit can run the later bus
drums brakes which is good for drilling to Porsche pattern :)

My main concerns with the Bus Boys kit right now are the custom inner flange
(Thing part?) and if the upper shock mount is stock, weld in (yuck!), or a
bolt on (like the Kruizinwagon kit).

... In my opinion to do it right will be very time consuming and wallet
draining, but probably worth it in the long run if you like to drive your
bus hard or as a DD...  Then again a lot of work for an extra 10MPH...

Check these out:

Both are simular to the bus-boys kit. This style kit is much better than 
going with the bug IRS parts and brakes I believe.
