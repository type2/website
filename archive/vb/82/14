Bus boys have been doing this conversion for quite some time.  Read the two
IRS setup descriptions, and you will see that the first IRS set up (the one
you have) is meant for a lowered ride due to the fact that the CV joints
don't play well at the stock height angles.

Hope this helps
Charles

P.S. I'm sure someone would want to buy your current IRS setup, maybe even
trade for a stock rear trans and RGB's.
