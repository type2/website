it was either stupid or smart of the criminals to take my '67 beetle - both an oddball, one-off year but also mass produced in huge numbers.  my beetle was pretty straight and clean; it could sit with show cars proudly.  i hope that is reason enough not to part it out.

in equal parts to the crime of stealing my beetle was the theft of jon's early westy stuff.  i suspect that if someone is swapping '67 beetle parts and '55 westy interior parts or a '59 westy rack, maybe the swapper's stuff should get a good, hard look.

i feel i'd have no problem identifying my beetle should i ever see it again.  i've been through it upside, downside, inside and out.  i've also been through all the things i could have done differently that day that would have meant that my beetle and i would still be together.  <sigh>
