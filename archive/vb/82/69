Subject: one toke over the line...

no, i'm not smokin' anything, but today i crossed into a new realm of
reality when i installed a "performance", "non-stock" part on my '59
westy--an original (apparently pre-'63 according to d. mayes) empi camber
compensator. the entire installation took 17 minutes, including being
interrupted by a phone call. on the winding way home from work, i noticed
that it seemed to not be as wishy-washy in the corners. it actually seemed
to do it's "job", and i noticed that i could zip around a particular turn
that before i would notice roll in, was now a nice firm corner.
the only thing i do not like alot is the way it attaches to the
transmission. i wish the "U" shaped flanges that slide over the 2 lower
studs (per side) on the tranny were full circle, to prevent the bracket
from potential loosening and slipping. this would mean though that the
studs would have to be removed, at least on one side. i guess it could alsomean that actual bolts could be installed also. hmmm.....
gee, i guess this old age thing is getting to me...next thing you know i'llhave dual carbs!
