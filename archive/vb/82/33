Subject: RE: [VB] Stolen VW's

All this talk of stolen cars makes me  for perhaps the first time makes me 
happy that I live in the cold midwest.  I have been going to VW meets for 3 
years now.  I do not think that I have ever taken the keys out of the 
ignition, let alone lock my bus up.  One time last year I inadvertanly left 
a $50 bill on my dash, and went out into the swap area,  when I came back 3 
hours later it was still there.

At home it is pretty much the same thing whether I am at work or shopping.  
I cannot think of anyone that I know personally who has ever had a car 
stolen out here.  Hell, most people probably could not figure out the 
shifter let alone drive a VW.  It is not because they are dumb,  I remeber 
kids rebuliding carbs on their 460's and 454's in the parking lot at school, 
  these guys could rebuild a 350 in their sleep.  VWs beyond sandrails are 
not on the agenda out here.

I want to let you know that feel for you and I hope that you find your car!
