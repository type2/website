Subject: Jerome Jamboree raffle bus

The Arizona Bus Club has a 1966 single cab that we will be restoring for this 
year's Jerome Jamboree's grand prize in the raffle.  For those who may not 
know about this, every year the ABC restores a bus and raffles it off at our 
main event, the Jerome Jamboree, in September.  The bus is done by club 
members who voulenteer their time (and materials).  We seek donations from 
wherever we can for things the vehicle is in need of.  I won't take up too 
much band width listing everything we need, but if you can help out and are 
interested in being given credit as a donor, you can e-mail me.  I did just 
pick up the core short block, which means we need heads (or cores), 
pistons/cylinders, sheet metal, fan/shroud, generator, carb, etc.  Also, some 
previous owner had cut the fender wells out, so we need them, too.

Anyway, thanks in advance for any help,
