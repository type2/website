Another way to go is cut out the bus torsion and install a complete irs bug
torsion and trans. Have done this twice and it works great. It lowers the
bus though, but you can install wider rear wheels and tires as the bug setup
is narrower. It also lowers the motor about an inch so you need to get a
wider engine seal rubber. With a 1776 eng. you can cruise at almost any
speed.
