Subject: RE: [VB] The new cal-look... was surface rust

a bunch of years ago i knew a guy who bought volkswagens cheap, did them up prudy and sold 'em for big bucks to the hotrod, 3-foot stinger folks.  one day i was checking out his shop, projects, etc.  i noticed that every single one of the vws was slammed, some so much so i doubted they could roll.

i asked him about it and he said that the very first thing he did when he got a new vw was to slam it.  he said something about how he couldn't start the process until the vw was on the floor.  i thought that was funny but kept it to myself.  i also asked him about the cost to do a vw for me, stock vs. the custom ones he normal did.  he told me it'd be cheaper to do stock which i thought was very interesting.

as a calif native, none of my vws has been lowered before doing cosmetics or mechanicals.  one had its front lifted (but not quite to stock height) before anything was done cosmetically or mechanically.  another was nearly finished cosmetically and mechanically before it had its nasty, sagging front end swapped for one that puts it at stock height.  the last has been and still is stock height since it left the factory and while it is mechanically sound, it is an ugly sight to behold.
