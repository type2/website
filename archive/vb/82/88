Subject: carbs

Has anyone researched or has heard of 34-PICT carbs being adapted into dual
carb configuration ? Years ago I found a rolled bug and bought the 1776 dual
34 baby dells engine in it. The carbs were trashed but the intakes were
good. I adapted 1973 Honda Civic carbs with adapter plates to the manifolds
and with four tries at rejetting, manage to get them to work well under
"most" conditions on my 1835 that was in my old 65 crew cab. The reason I
started this thread was that I was thinking the other day that my old Honda
carbs were nearly the same configuration, throttle linkage wise, as the
34-PICT. Rigging up another throttle linkage wouldn't be all that difficult,
but I haven't read anywhere where someone has tried them. Now that we have
many sources for jets for the 34-PICT, setting up a dual carb set out some
would be interesting. But it would only make sense if you were like me and
had several laying around ready for rebuild, not if you bought new ones.

Just a thought
