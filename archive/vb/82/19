It does work. I'm not saying its better than a weld but, with newer cars,
welding isn't feasible with the high strength (and high warpage) steels they
have in them.

Body shops use a brand called Duramix, SEM makes a comparable product for
about half the price. They have adhesives that can be used on non-structural
panels like sails, door skins, etc and structural products that can be used
on roofs, rockers, etc.

I saw a demo they did for our shop where they glued two pieces of a body
panel together and left it over night. The next day we put the glued pieces
on a frame machine and pulled on either end of the panel with the gluded
section in between. The steel stretched and broke leaving the glued section
intact.

BTW, body shops use it because its easier, quicker and doesn't warp the
surrounding metal, not because its stonger.
