Subject: RE: [VB] Fulcrum Plates needed

I got mine via second party from Rancho.  $10 bucks a piece brand new!  I
would suggest new parts in the swing axle as if you don't have the
tolerances correct, things can be a pain!  Not to mention, how many times do
you want to tear down the swing axle tranny anyway???

Has anybody ever used Long Enterprises in Sebastopol? I know he has a pretty
complete list of parts on his website.
