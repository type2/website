  Some Chrysler products door hindges are glued on, not welded, bolted or
riveted.
Also on the new Chevy trucks the beds are glued together, again no rivets,
spot welds or bolts.
  I couldn't believe this myself till I went to my friends body shop and
watched them GLUE on the side of the pick-up bed!
  They have special equipment to undo the glue and to apply it. I trird to
split one of the glued seams on the old bed and it wouldn't budge. Techo has
come a long way!

I've been hearing this for a while, but I still have a hard
time believing it.  With a weld, you're melting the two pieces
and fusing them together.  Glue can't do that to metal (but it
does for plastic).  A properly welded piece doesn't actualy
fail at the weld - it fails in the metal around it.

Anyone know what the product name for this magic glue is?  I
have some work I'm going to do on the 911 and I could try it.
