A guy on a F(-at-)rd hi-po list I hung out on for a while had a similar
story.  He had spent time and bucks on a nice stock resto of an old
Fairlane.  It was stolen from his driveway.  A few days later, a
Fairlane of the same year and model, same color interior, showed up
in front of a house a few blocks away.  If I remember right, the
theif at least threw a quick paint job on it.  

He checked it out casually ("Hey, man, cool F(-at-)rd!") and then brought
the local constabulary around to check further.  The new title matched
the chassis ID plate that was on it at the time, but while he was doing
the resto, he had marked the original chassis number and other
identifying data in all kinds of places on the frame and body and taken
pictures of the marks.  After a bit of crawling around and mirror-and-
flashlight work by Officer Friendly, he got his Fairlane back.

There have been many good suggestions on the list.  Asking at your
local police department, sheriff's office, or highway patrol office
will probably yield more.  They've seen it all and can probably tell
you what is "popular" with the thieves in your area.
