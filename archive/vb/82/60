Subject: RE: [VB] transaxle conversion

  I have installed a few of the bolt on (type 1 arm) kits and will never do
it again. Getting them set right to have the proper caster, camber and toe
is very time consuming and almost always seems to change. The angle of the
inner pivots is very critical for proper rear alignment and I personally
don't feel the type 1 (IRS) arms are strong enough for this. I have gotten
stock ride height out of the bolt on kit, after 2 days of messing with the
clamp on pivots, pivot pin spacers, etc. I feel the Bus Boys late type 2 arm
kit is the way to go or CE total replacement frame kit! or just leave it
stoc.
  My 60 DD with RGB cruises at 75 mph at 3500 rpm, no problem.

ronnie, been there done that

Actually after more consideration...

Is there a bolt in kit (no weld in control arm mounts) that uses Beetle hubs
(assume spring plates as well) and keeps the stock ride height?  The stock
ride height is the kicker on this question :)

This in a way might be better since the 944 rear brakes can very easily bolt
right on there!  I already have a very nice set of rear 944 calipers sitting
around and would just need the hub, rotors, and e-brake stuff.  The only
concern is that the 944 sticks out an extra 22-23mm which might cause the
15x6 Fuchs to rub the fender lip, not good.

Or mebbe 944 rear brakes bolt right up to bay stubs and control arms???
Dunno.

Just some more thoughts to make it really confusing :)

Where are Charles (Bus Boys) and Greg B on this issue!  They do this
everyday.
