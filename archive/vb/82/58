Hi Blake,
The problem with this is if there happens to be one lurker thief on this list 
or someone tells the wrong someone where this plate would be put.  Once the 
cat was out of the bag the plates in a standard location would dissappear 
when the buses were stolen.  
  Best to have volks install thier plates or just stamp in ID numbers in any 
location they think is most likely to be not noticed or undercoated over.
  Of course if both of these procedures were done on each bus the results 
would probably be even better.  Stamping your chassi number into 
subassemblies as the engine case, tranny, etc., etc. would really increase 
catching a thief.
