      Every body shop that's worth a damn (the shop I was at had the contract 
with of the local car dealerships here in Eugene.  They included  BMW - 
Mercedes -  Jaguar-Honda - Toyota - Volkswagen.  uses these redundant 
products the cover there butts and give the customer the best possible 
repair.  The idea  of  just shooting primer of the rust is down right scary.  
Primer and Paint breath, you'll have air on your rust sooner or later, you 
will also have a very unhappy customer wondering why they have rust bubbles 
under their paint.
       Of course, most body shops don't even offer a warranty with rust 
repairs, but the shops that want repeat business, are straight up with their 
customers, and do everything they can possible do make that rust repair stay 
repaired, even if it does get a little redundant.
                                                                              
Peace,
