Subject: Powder coat makin's

So where does a guy go to buy powder coat powder?  I was thinking of buying 
one of those erape $79 powder coat contraptions and trying it on my own.  
One of you helpful listees (John:) told me to use HPC black for my engine 
tin.  I guess this would be gloss black.  Anyways, I looked around and could 
find black, white, etc. but where do you normally go for the stuff (HPC)?  
Anyone ever use one of these cheapo coaters?  Thanks as usual.  What would 
us dummies do without the knowledge of this group?  Gerald
