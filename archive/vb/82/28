I can't rember the name of the stuff, i'll ask Mark in the morning to see if
he rembers, as for Ronnie's  findings on the Chevys and  so forth ,  it  may
seem great at this time but  who knows about in a few years . I have no
faith in most of the techno ideas of the big automakers since i saw my
daughter sitting in the remnats of an 83 z-28  a few years back that the
front end and plastic dash literally disdegrated around her and my nephew.
That may be wrong. but thats my opinion....later
