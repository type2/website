Hi Pete,
Unfortunately it sounds like you do not know when, how or who your built your 
engine.  Also it could be a number of factors that is dragging down the HP 
and torque output of your engine.  Anything from the carb jetting to the 
muffler used.  Plus you might be one of those volks that will not be happy 
with anything less than a 2 liter.  The bug tranny you are using should 
result in a 60 MPH (-at-) 3,000 RPM.  A 3.875 R&P freeway flier with stock bus 
1964-67 RGBs will result in 58 MPH (-at-) 3,000 RPM.

 Also, should I try running a 195/75-15 as opposed to the 205's??

sure it is built well for the free extra HP you can get with proper building.
