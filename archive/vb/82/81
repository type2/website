Check out the parts manuals at http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/ .
A lot of times, the diameter, thread pitch, and grade are specified
in the part description.  If the data is not there, check the part
number.  If the number is like N 12 345, it's a "standard part" and
you will find the details in the "standard part" section of the manual.
VW used these numbers for industry-standard fasteners like nuts, bolts,
washers, cotter pins, etc.  If the number is a regular VW part number
like 211 123 456, you probably won't find any more details in the
manual; you'll have to find someone that has measured the actual part
to get the specs.

If you are trying to replace a "standard part" with one just a bit
longer or shorter, try your local _hardware_ store.  They carry metric
bolts in a range of thread pitches, diameters, and strength grades.
Note that Home Depot, Lowe's, and Wal-Mart are _not_ hardware stores.
You're looking for a place like "Bob's True Value".  If you are trying
to replace a VW-number part you will have to get more creative.

I hope this helps!
