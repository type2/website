Howdy all,

On the subject of identifying parts with stamps, etc.,
could one not also weld/rivet/etc a type2 tag
(engraved, metal) on a spot of the underbody, then
undercoat that?  If many people did this in a similar
place we would all know where to look.  It would
probably not be noticed by anyone not looking for it,
but it could be easily scraped down and revealed.
