Subject: Clutch questions

When I start my '62 bus with the clutch pedal down it start smooth and when 
I let it idle and step off the pedal the bus moves forward just a little bit 
and the engine starts to labor. It makes a slight noise when I put it in 
reverse, but it's not grinding. Also, when shifting from 1st to 2nd it 
sometimes seems to slip into reverse. In general when shifting to 2nd it 
feels like a guessing game, will I get 4th, reverse or actually hit 2nd. My 
question is this: Does this sound like the clutch cable needs a basic 
adjustment or is it possibly something else? Any sugestions as to what to 
look at? Linkage, pressure plate, other?

Thanks in advance,
Joshua
