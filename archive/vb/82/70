Yes. You need to apply the adhesive to bare metal. It would work on small
areas as well as large.

I think there is an insert in the body that the fastener screws into.
Prehaps the insert has broken loose. If it has, the only way I know to fix
it is to weld another insert on. You could remove the entire hinge
attachment section of the body, repair the insert and weld the hinge section
back on. Not a task for the beginner. Does anybody know of a better way?
