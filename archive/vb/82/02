Lucky for me, my 59 ragtop didnt go anywhere, except down and around the
corner where the thieves were then scared away by someone. I Found it
sitting there the next morning, they pushed it there.

My friend recently had his 56 oval stolen, license plate said phat56 so
some of you AZ'ers may have seen it at shows. He had a reverse locking
shifter too. Makes no difference, they towed it somewhere never to be seen
again.

Some stolen cars go back to the show! I remember at the classic a few years
ago when a guy found his stolen bug on display in the car show area! Cops
were all over that.
