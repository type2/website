that is one of the things i like best about the campouts i go to.  my single cab hangs with the other buses happy for bus company, unlocked and keys in the ignition.  i always figured that if some miscreant wanted to take my truck from a place like jerome or havasu, there'd be people who'd know to stop 'em.

of course, now i might not be leaving the keys in the ignition... but it has no refection of the nice folks i camp with!
