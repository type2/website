Subject: Re: [VB] Fulcrum Plates needed

Doesn't every large city have a good mechanic/salvage/junk yard? I'm in
Dallas and within an hour of here I probably have 5 good sources of stuff
like fulcrum plates. Without them my bus would have ever seen the highway.
All resto projects should have a good new parts house, a good salvage
source, a good new mechanic and a good old guy who remembers how the bus fit
together when it was new.

I would be lost without any one of these.

I know there is at least one big source in Washington State and a couple of
good shops in Portland.
