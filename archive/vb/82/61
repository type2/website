Question?.... Will you need to remove paint from the
parts your glueing? I'm guessing here, but wouldn't it

perform better on larger areas, than small areas.

Case inpoint: hinges for side gates? Where because the
bolt in the body is turning & unable to tighten the
blasted thing down.

I have tried to drill thru the broken off screw in
there, it only spins. haven't tried to open things up
from inside---Yet!

Could use some idea's here.
