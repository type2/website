Hi, I was just wanting to make sure everyone that is interested in doing 
body work on thier busses knows about this page. It is owned and operated by 
len sterwart, an extremely knowledgeable autobody professional. If it 
weren't for the disscussion board on this page, i'd never have figured out 
how to paint my own bus. This site is perfect for the newbie 
do-it-yourselfer like me. Although it isn't focused on vw's, there is still 
such a wealth of information concerning rust removal and prevention that 
most body man like to keep to themselves.

P.S. thanks so much for everyone who responded to my last post. I'm new to 
vw's and now have a really good idea who is the best parts place to get my 
goodies.
John
