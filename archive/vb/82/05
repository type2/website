Then the story of the stolen Deluxe in Cali. One of the stolen buses friends
was driving down the street and saw his friends stolen bus (in a different
city). He called his friend, the cops came, they went to the door. The bus
owner came out and said it was his bus and had just bought it for 8000
dollars. The cops checked the numbers and it matched the NEW Cali title, the
PO said look here and there for hidden identifying features (he also had
pics with him) and they all matched. Under further inspection they noticed
the numbers had been changed. Along comes the tow truck, away goes the bus
and the NEW owner was out the 8000 dollars he had just paid.

Ronnie

ps. this all happened in a 2 week period
pps. the thieves didn't even steal or change anything on the bus!

If all the body parts are showing up then, presumably, the body number is on

the appropriate part?  Does the "man" frequent these shows?  I have never 
seen one if they do.  I see occasional items re thefts online but is there a

central repository that one could print and haul to a show to reference as 
they peruse the mechandise (with a big f***ing saw to take their hands off 
with?).

I would think that all listees are going to watch for bug fenders the color 
of Rachel's at the next few meets... yes?
