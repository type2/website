Subject: Re: [VB] east to west transport----Westy rack for sale

Great time for you left coasters who want an original '65 westy rack with new 
wood to pick it up:) I'm in Peoria, IL (about three hours south of Chicago...)
The racks for sale on the samba (look it up on the search for more details).
Best,
