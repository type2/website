So what kinda transaxle do you have Thom?  What's the gearing like?  Do you
still have small nuts?  What size is you motor?  I'm about to get a
transmission rebuilt but I'm gonna stay small nut as I have two sets of
redux boxes and drums etc.. and the vw tool that fits the nuts, but I would
love to get 70 mph - I'd be happy with anything over 60 mph.
