You must have a Mexi or Brazil muffler and/or sometimes I have seen the
Ernst German mufflers have the same problem

Subject: [VB] Bus exhaust question


I started fitting the bus exhaust on the 1600 today in preparation to get
the flanges welded on tomorrow.  After getting things lined up and bolted on
the engine, I decided to see how the other bus specific parts fit.  Is it
just my particular muffler or is there a gap between the mounting tab on the
muffler and the tab on the damper?  It seems as if one of the tabs is in the
wrong position.
