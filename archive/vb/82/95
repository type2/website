Hi Steve,
Oncre apon a time wheels were made only with the hub in line with the center 
of the width of the rim.  With the advent of steel rims and tires the 
manufactures could move the center of the rim and tire to the inside or 
outside of the hub of the wheel.  Thus widening or narrowing the width of the 
total axle.  The problem with this setup is if the wheel bearings are not 
designed for this offset they can be ruined far quicker due to the side load 
put on them due to the center of the rim/tire being offset.  We found this 
out in the late 70s when Eric's parents installed Corvette like tires and 
rims that moved the center line of these farther outward on thier 1971 bus.  
Resulting in 30,000 mile rear wheel bearing instead of the easily 100,000+ 
mile standard lifespan.
