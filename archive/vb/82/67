Subject: Torsion arm end o-ring

Hi,

For some reason, there was a rubber o-ring in one of my bottom torsion 
arm ends (the end that would be against the king pin assembly, where the 
link pin slides through). There's a groove/lip there that seems to make 
sense for an o-ring. However, in none of the exploded views do I see an 
o-ring identified.

Anyone else who has done King Pins seen an o-ring in this location?

Thanks,
Conrad
