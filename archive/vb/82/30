Subject: Re: [VB] distributor rebuild kit?

When I posted this question to RAMVA last year the only suggestion I got
was to buy an old distributor at a VW show flea market and cannibalize
it.

FWIW Bob Hoover once posted to RAMVA about rebuilding a stock
distributor every 70K miles for "replacement of the end-play shims and
oil-sealing micarta washers".
