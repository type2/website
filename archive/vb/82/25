Subject: 67 deluxe interior prob.



I'm trying to figure out if my 67 13 window bus is suppose to have 2 coat 
hooks or one? There wasn't any coathooks when I bought it. I have since 
aquired one for behind the driver's side. there is still a single hold up 
there for something else. Maybe an assist strap? the passenger side has one 
similar hole. not two holes which would be needed for an additional coat 
hook. By looking at pics on the internet I haven't been able to conclude 
what my bus was suppose to have.
