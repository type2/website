You are correct only to a certain point. Wire wheeling, grinding and sanding
are the only ways to remove the top layer of rust. That is why all the
products that you find that are designed for application over rust say to
remove any loose particles of rust before application. This topmost, "loose"
layer consists of completely oxidized metal and it acts as an insulator from
any coatings that may be applied to the surface of the panel.

The correct to remove this oxidized top layer is by physical abrasion. Any
particles of rust that remain after physical abrasion, whether the particles
are "pushed" into the metal or remain in small pockets on the surface, will
be neutralized by the first layer of coating. This layer can be a conversion
product such as Ospho, a zinc based 2 part primer, or a 2 part primer
designed for painting over bare metal, such as PPG DPxx epoxy products.

After the surface is protected with the primer, It doesn't matter if the
fine particles of oxidataion are "in" or "on" the metal. Either way, the
coating will act as a barrier to air and water, the two compounds that react
with metal to form rust.

BTW, most body shops don't use conversion products. They are an added
expense and they require additional labor to sand or clean the surface
before application of primer. Since the primer protects the reconditioned
surface from further oxidataion, application of the conversion product would
be redundant.
