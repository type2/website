Subject: RE: [VB] Bus exhaust question

It is indeed an Ernst.  However I feel the primary cause is the damper pipe
rather than the bracket welded on the muffler.  I had a second exhaust kit
that is comprised of a Leistritz (sp) muffler and Dansk damper.  The Dansk
damper fits much better than the Ernst damper.  All parts except the one
damper are German or so labeled anyway.

BTW, is General(-at-)OldVolks.com the best way to contact you about parts
questions?

You must have a Mexi or Brazil muffler and/or sometimes I have seen the
Ernst German mufflers have the same problem
