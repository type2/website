I agree with Kevin, angle a smaller bit through carefully and if it is
possible, get a dental pick in alog side of the screw when you advance to
the larger drill. But if it's spinning, does the mean your threads are
trashed, or can you run it through one direction? If you have a dimpled hole
already, chuck up and easy out on your drill and try reversing it out. Or
you can be like Greg and torch the whole area out and weld in a new piece !

whenever a bolt i am trying to drill through spins, i try to angle the drill
so that i am pusshing kind of at an angle through the bolt, so the pressure
is
unequally applied to the side.

good luck
