Subject: RE: [VB] Head rebuilders

Try http://www.avp-worldwide.com/ in Sacramento.
They welded up a head for my '81 Vanagon after I
screwed up and left a push rod in the wrong place
and broke the sealing surface for the cover.
Primarily a mail order house.

They know what causes valve seats to drop and how
to correct the problem in the T4 engines. A very
pleased customer.  I was able to check them out
a few years ago when my Vanagon sucked a valve seat.

If my T3 engine is toast when I start rebuilding,
I'll go there for a rebuilt.
