Subject: Frame Fork/Tran Mount Bolt size/length?

I will be mounting a hitch to my bus soon. It attaches to the large
bolts at the frame fork/trans mount, V's to apoint, then to the bumper
to simply hold it up.
I would like to know the size of the large bolts, pitch, etc, as I will
seek even stronger, slightly longer ones to offset the amoun they must
get backed out for the thickness of the hitch metal.
Better yet, any one else do this, and have a sourse/length
recommendation for this application?
I will be towing a reproduction of the westy camping (little wood one)
trailer I am brewing up, after I overcome the hitch issues.

Thanks,
Al
