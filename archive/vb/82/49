Yes, very interested!

I have zero need for a non-functioning tow hitch.  

In fact if you can make it beefier and have a higher load rating I would be
game for that.  Would not need to look like a Westfakia either.  Form
follows function.

Seems that GoWesty has similar designed baywindow hitches for $110.  Since
they are high on price most of the time it seems to me somewhere between
75-100 would be reasonable.  Then again I am not sure what used split
hitches go for anyway?

As a side note this would be with a 2" ball right?
