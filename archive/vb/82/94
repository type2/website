Hi AL,
For the strongest towing point best to attach the tow hitch to the torsion 
bar tubes instead with U-bolts around them.

No can do!  Unless you can get a company to make some for you.  The bolt 
shaft length is 41mm long of the 52.5mm total bolt length.  For 26mm of this 
length the threads are 18mm outer diameter.  Then there is a 3mm long tapered 
section going to the 11mm long 19.5 diameter blank part of the shaft next to 
the hex head.  Without this 19.5mm diameter the tanny cradle would shift 
around.  Even if you got someone to make some you would be totally relying on 
the threads of these bolts to hold against the towed object.
