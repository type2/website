Subject: RE: Piston Size

Hello

	I have a couple of question of the group if you all don't mind. I am trying
to get a better understanding of what kind of engine I have here in front of
me.

	I just pulled apart a spare engine I have and am wondering if anyone would
know what the piston numbers mean. The numbers are 1275 and 095107+ 9 7 all
the pistons have the same markings. Will this number tell me displacement
and if so does anyone want to guess on the engine size.

	Also the case number is 32 VW 000 101 102 is this an late case good for
rebuilding? I would like to rebuild this engine and put it into my 21 window
but I am just starting off and don't know if this case is worth the effort.

PS: This is my first Engine Rebuild Attempt so please bare with me.


Thanks in Advance
