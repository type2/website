Subject: Westfalia Tow hitch FS.  

I think there is enough interest out there.  I am
hoping to get some confirmation from you all.

Everyone wants a Westy tow hitch, but they are very
hard to find.  

I am planning to have some Westfalia tow hitches
reproduced in the next 3 months.  The quantity will
depend on what kind of feedback i get and the price
that seams reasonable.  I have worked out most of the
mechanical details.  They will be 90% exact copies of
the later Westfalia tow hitches.  (There are at least
3 different "Westfalia" tow hitch designs out there)
(email me if you want to know the differences)

I say 90% because i will be converting the metric size
steel to english and will probably have to do at least
one other unknown shortcut.  Also,  there will be no
Westy tag.  I am also not sure what to do about the
load capacity and the liability that goes along with
that.  They may be for "decorative purposes" only.

My questions:

1.  IS there any interest out there?  
2.  What are you all willing to pay for one?
3.  Dealers (Ronnie, Bus Depot, others), would you be
willing to carry any?  
4.  I am looking for any and all input.  (email me
privatly if you wish so we do not take up too much
band width)
5.  If need be, would you be willing to put a deposit
down to reserve one for yourself?
6.  To keep cost down, would you accept it unpainted?

I have a few originals to copy from so i am certain
that they will be right.  (No, they are not for sale)

Let me know what you all think.  I think there should
be enough interest out there and definatly have a good
plan to get it done.

Thanks 
Matthew
