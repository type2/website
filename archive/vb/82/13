All this talk about stolen busses, and having direct contact with Rachel's
bug that weekend, even if I get the dc together for octo/classic weekend...
would I ever want to take it down (trailered or driven)...  egad, the
nightmares will start tonight. :-0

(ok, ok, get the dc done this year, next, or the one after that <grin>)
