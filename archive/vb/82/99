Subject: Re: [VB] Fulcrum Plates needed

Hi Volks,
Even when you buy new fulcrum plates, make sure to measure the slop in there 
for less than .008" play with a feeler gauge.  If it results in more than 
this amount you will probably need the oversized fulcrum plates.  Unless of 
course you have found NOS bus RGB upper axles!  ;-)
