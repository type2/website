I've been hearing this for a while, but I still have a hard
time believing it.  With a weld, you're melting the two pieces
and fusing them together.  Glue can't do that to metal (but it
does for plastic).  A properly welded piece doesn't actualy
fail at the weld - it fails in the metal around it.

Anyone know what the product name for this magic glue is?  I
have some work I'm going to do on the 911 and I could try it.
