Terry , You ain't hurt'in my feeling at all thats your opinion. And yes i
know their glued together , but does that mean that its the mother of all
fixes and the best thing since sliced bread? No i'm sorry not in my book
,too many of the big automakers innovative ideas have bitten them on the ass
later for me to buy that. Most of them are POS . I made no mention of trucks
in the other post what i said was CARGO VANS, ie Mickey  Van bodies in
particular, thats the co we worked for and saw the results. I was referring
to moving van bodies.   I've been welding for 31 years now every thing from
truck chassis and heavy equipment, to trailers 40 k gross and more. Also
with zero  failures of my welds to my knowledge. As i said this is MY
feelings on the subject, you are entitled to yours as well. Nuff said on the
subject i'm done. See ya
