       As I mentioned the problem with mechanically aggressive means of rust 
removal (grinding/wire wheels/etc.) is the the particles of rust get pushed 
deeper and deeper into the metal.  Most folks think of metal as hard and 
unyielding, actually it is quite fluid when you look at it from the Body 
Techs view point.  This fluidity for example allows us to shrink metal, the 
heat spreads the molecules apart (relaxing the metal).  Then the shrink spot 
is hammered toward the center, pushing the molecules tighter together.  The 
main trouble with grinding is the heat, no matter how good you are with a 
grinder, there is
still heat.  Basically this heat expands the metal and the grinding disc 
pushes the rust into the expanded metal.

"We do not know about the product Ospho, but phosphoric acid does not convert 

rust it removes it"

       Enclosed is a link to a web site amazingly run by a bus guy.  This guy 
has really gotten into products.  But I am afraid he has Ospho on his 
excluded list (stuff he didn't test).  But this is the class of product he 
put Ospho in.  "Paints and coatings which are intended to be applied over a 
rusted surface to encapsulate the rust but not chemically change the rust,  
are not included in this comparison."
       
       As I mentioned, Ospho encapsulates the rust with  a harmless coating 
of black iron oxide, but if the surface is broken, air or moisture will enter 
and the rust will continue.  You'll see the chemical analysis also on the bus 
guys wide site.  Basically changing red  iron oxide to harmless black iron 
oxide.  
       The markers of Oshpo is also on the web site, but alas Ospho does not 
have a site.  But there address is the in case you have anymore 
misconceptions about the product. <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/goodytommy/rust/index.htm#excluded">Chemical Rust Treatment Comparisons</A> 
This second link is to  a hmmmmm.  It's sort of a chemical users new 
group--lots of neat info.  <A HREF="http://www.finishing.com/3400-3599/3480.html">3480. Is hydrogen embrittlement a concern with 
Ospho finish?</A>  My thanks to Solo Hobbit for the info and a very interesting 
web site.  It was a gas!
