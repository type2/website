Amateur radio types have been doing this sort of thing for a decade now.
It's called "APRS" for "Automatic Position Reporting System".  Vehicles
are equipped with a VHF transmitter and GPS unit, which periodically
relays the position of the vehicle to amateur APRS repeaters.  Beyond the
initial equipment cost, there are no fees.

You can go on the internet
and see a map locating all APRS-equipped
vehicles no matter where they are.  They even have it on the international
space station, just in case it might be stolen!  :)

In the early days of APRS, a ham had his APRS-equipped vehicle stolen and
called the police.  "My car has been stolen, but I know where it is."  The
cops had a hard time believing that he not only knew where his car was,
but which direction it was being driven and how fast it was going.  Once
he clued them in, they zeroed in on the perp and recovered the vehicle.

Cool thing!
