That's really a good idea! For restoration or custom vehicles it would make
ID a lot easier, unless the perps are on this list too! As for mine, I just
leave the signed title in the overhead, the perps can register it easier
that way ! And my wife would be happier!

It might be a good idea to mark parts uniquely.  A set of number stamps
applied to non-visible edges of various panels might be great evidence if
you have digital pictures of the marks after you put them on!  It wouldn't
remove the problem of theft, but might make prosecution of the hackers
easier.
