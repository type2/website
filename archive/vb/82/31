Subject: RE: [VB] Stolen VW's

if anyone at pomona sees parts from rachel's bug (shiny white 67) or even
the car in the car corral, an early slopy westy rack, or a box of early
(55) westy parts (greg noble will be scouring for sure and can identify the
parts as he has seen them first hand), please do something. i guess maybe
at least take digital pics of the bastards, get phone numbers (all
secretive like..), get names, get security, whatever. any help getting
either the fu<ker$ that stole our stuff or the getting the car back would
be greatly appreciated.

please see website for pics of the car and some details that are unique.

next week i hope to have a very detailed list of the westy parts that were
ripped off for those who may go to pomona and could help.
