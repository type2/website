Subject: New VW birth certificate info

A friend of mine recently tried to pay for his VW certificate using
american express card. They mailed him a letter stating american express is
not accepted, but Visa, Mastercard, and "dinners club" is accepted.
What the hell is dinners club? Anyone know?

Btw the letter states it is now 15 Euro for the certificate.

"Because at the royal cruise ship, they wont take VISA, but they will take
American express."
Those commercials are a joke, seems like its always the other way around to
me.
