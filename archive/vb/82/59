Subject: RE: [VB] transaxle conversion

Actually after more consideration...

Is there a bolt in kit (no weld in control arm mounts) that uses Beetle hubs
(assume spring plates as well) and keeps the stock ride height?  The stock
ride height is the kicker on this question :)

This in a way might be better since the 944 rear brakes can very easily bolt
right on there!  I already have a very nice set of rear 944 calipers sitting
around and would just need the hub, rotors, and e-brake stuff.  The only
concern is that the 944 sticks out an extra 22-23mm which might cause the
15x6 Fuchs to rub the fender lip, not good.

Or mebbe 944 rear brakes bolt right up to bay stubs and control arms???
Dunno.

Just some more thoughts to make it really confusing :)

Where are Charles (Bus Boys) and Greg B on this issue!  They do this
everyday.
