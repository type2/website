Subject: FW: Latest Rage caught in San Diego fires

Taken from the vintagevw list. Lastest rage is in a few of the pics. Looks
like they lost a few trailers full of parts, but a Baja bug on top of a
container was spared
Subject: Latest Rage caught in San Diego fires



Gang,
Latest Rage may not be answering their phones for a while.  A friend sent
me these pix, link at bottom of this message (he works for Cox
Communications...these pix are from their work at a switch that was
affected by the fires in Alpine).  The "Channelmatic" building houses
Latest Rage.  You can see burned out trailers in the first picture, and in
the 5th row, far right 2 pictures. Looks like there might be VW rims in
that rubble.

My parents' house was spared, but houses within 1/8 mile in a few
directions around them burned down.
