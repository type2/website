I figure that the 0.016" (0.40 mm) setting was a pretty good average
for the days when dwell meters didn't exist or were too expensive.
($12 is hard to argue with:
http://www.actron.com/cgi-bin/web_store.cgi?page=cp7603.htm .  Standard
disclaimers apply.)  I set them at 0.016" or so to get started, then
make adjustments after using a dwell meter.  Usually I end up a little
narrower, like around 0.014" or so.

The bay-window Bentley gives the feeler-gauge spec at 0.016"-0.020"
(0.40-0.50 mm) for the stock distributors in '68-'79.  It also gives
dwell meter instructions, which start by telling you to get it close
with a feeler gauge (so the engine will start) before hooking up the
meter.
