Hey Guys,

I am soooo touched.....fires are close, but nothing threatening.  P&C have some close to their home, but I spoke with them last night and their place should be in the clear.

All is well in our neck of the woods.

I haven't had much time to read e-mail due to all of the evacuees we have in the hotel/casino I work for, so it has been tons of OT the past week.  I have met dozens of people over the past few days that have lost everything.  Many got out with just the clothes that they are wearing.

Any other listees affected or need help due to the fires?

If so, ping me off or onlist and I'll help out in any way that I can. (Storage space/help moving etc.) I'm sure there are others willing to do the same.

Feeling very lucky the past few days....

Beto
63EZ
Murrieta, CA
