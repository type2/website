I got the idea of wrapping the tube from someone on the list, may have been you that mentioned it!!!   It was really easy, the length was a tad under 4', and I had bought a roll of insulation that was 4' long, so I just cut ~1 inch off an end, wiggled it into place, cut along the long way once I figured how wide it needed to be, and zip tied it up.   15 minutes?    The shiny bubble wrap stuff is so easy to use! 

 If it worked for you in the front I'll try it there.  cool.  I mean, warm.  :)
 
 I believe that the pedal seals are pretty much the same as the spark plug wire seals, where they keep the air from blowing out of the cylinder tin, so if you have old spark plug wires, just pull those off them.  BTDT
 
 I've been meaning to replace my accerator rod with a new one, and have the parts and seals, but haven't done it yet.
