Subject: Correct filter for EMPI filter/pump?

Hello:

I put a filter/pump unit on my 1200 engine.  Didn't know what filter to 
use, so I went down to the parts store and they gave me a Bosch 0451 
102 056.  This was in the Philippines a couple of years back.  When I 
was there in August, I changed my oil, took off the filter, and tried 
to buy a new filter to match the old one.  This part number was no 
longer stocked, and no one had a cross-reference chart.  I ended up 
draining the old filter and putting it back on, though it's dented from 
taking it off with channel lock pliers.

Now that I'm about to return to the Philippines on Monday, I'd like to 
take a filter along.  I have consulted Fram and Purolater catalogs, but 
their cross-reference charts to not list the Bosch part number I have.  
So I'm back to square one.

What filter(s) fit(s) this pump?  I am running a stock exhaust, so I 
need a small filter.

Thanks!

Kabayo
