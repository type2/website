Wire wheel the heads and run a tap and die over all threads (both the
screws and holes in the overhead assembly).

Twas asked:

So - got the repainted steering wheel in - the repainted parcel tray in
etc..
etc.. - amazing.  That steering wheel looks great.

Anyway - I'm about to put the over head vent cover on - the cover with
the 14
screws.  I have all of the screws and they look very good - that is - no
striped heads or threads etc.. but they are kinda oxidized and sort of
black/grey.  Anyway to get the oxide off?  I soaked em overnight in some
bath
tub stain removed that contained phosphoric acid - didn't work.  I'm
thinking
about giving plumbers flux a try?
