Hey surlygirl, long time no hear. I have been using the plastiv filters
since the earl 70's with no problem. They do what they are supposed to
do and then you throw them away and replace them.

well congratulations on hopefully fixing the misfire problem!

about the plastic fuel filters:  i have never had a plastic one break,
come loose or explode in more than 15 years of vw driving.
cheers,
