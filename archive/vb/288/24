Subject: '65 new trans - hypothesis

First off, thanks to everyone who sounded off. as usual, some were right on target and others were close. The rest of you were at least supportive!

After suggestions from many and a talk this afternoon with my supplier, Ronnie at type2parts.com, I learned a few things.

I'm assuming that my gear sliders in the trans were out of arrangement when I installed the hockey stick.
They were all lined up, but I had shoved them into the case to do so. I have since learned that the 1/2 and 3/4 sliders should be in a "middle" position.

If you think about it in relation to the gearshift, it makes total sense.  Makes no sense on the concrete Saturday morning doing it for the first time though.

I think I had engaged 1st and 3rd simultaneously, is this possible?

I think a full early bus transmission R/R writeup will be forthcoming after this one.

Item #2. The axle tube retaining ring should have some sealant applied to it to keep it from leaking, as the bolts are only tightened to 14 ft/lbs. That would explain my oil leaks.  Ronnie said, "why didn't you ask me?"  The idea of sealant never crossed my mind so I didn't.  In all the reading I did of the archives/library/websites before and during this job, never once was a sealant mentioned. At least that I came across.  It has been recommended that I use silicone (auto grade). Discussion?

Gear oil should be filled while the tranny is out!  We had a humourous I.V. system arranged when we filled it in the bus last weekend. Took about 1.5 hours to get it full, Yowza!

Alright, so the engine comes back out this weekend. The newly installed trans (0 miles) will be pulled for the first time as well.

In the meantime I've purchased a new sump plate with drain hole. Since I have a full flow filter, I will henceforth dispense with the sump and all it's many pulled studs.

Also, a gas pedal rebuild kit and new accelerator cable have been purchased, with new carburetor return spring, as there were "issues" with this sytem during the last install leading to "less than optimum" performance.

thanks for listening, I will post about the job sunday night.  any comments are always appreciated.

Later,

Billy
