Dear Volksie Friends,

I had the same problem with a cheap rubbish meter made in China.
So I took an 2N2222 transistor, a few resistors and cooked it up. I just made the upper
half of the clip, which goes to the coilpoint, a little bit bigger, I still can grab it
comfortably.

Now I can set the angle. What would you guys suggest as a proper angle? Up to now I used
52 degrees.

Oh, I forgot, mine is an old 1132cc engine, made in 1961. There is a PICT 28 carburettor
on top.

Kind regards to you all, Michael Bernard, Johannesburg, South
Africa
