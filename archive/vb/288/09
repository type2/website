I'm certainly not a tranny expert, but I've had the unfortunate
opportunity to have replaced four trannys in this bus in four years, back
in the 90s - couldnt get a decent tranny rebuild from anyone, til I
finally sprung the really big bucks and convinced Rick Long to build me
one, which he did.

Is your coupler in good condition? It should be firm and not very pliant.
Are the two screw holes exactly in a line? They must be. Repops are
notorious for being out of line, which throws off the entire setup. Ask me
how I know. I won't buy a coupler unless I'm standing there at the counter
eyeing it myself. The holes MUST be aligned perfectly. A 1/16th inch off
is a whole gear. It's the difference between reaching 3-4 or not being
able to get it in there at all.

I'd say that if you've been thru the possible practical adjustment range,
and your coupler is good, and you're not getting results, then there is
trouble in the nose cone section, or things are stuck back in the gear
clusters. I'd suspect the latter at this point. Possibly, improper setup
while installing the nosecone - take it off and recheck the install
procedure, and do it again. Make sure all is correctly set and reassemble
the nosecone assembly.
