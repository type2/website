Ronnie said, "why didn't you ask me?"  The idea of sealant never crossed my mind so I didn't.  In all the reading I did of the archives/library/websites before and during this job, never once was a sealant mentioned. At least that I came across.  It has been recommended that I use silicone (auto grade). Discussion?

Yes, you should coat both sides of each of the three paper shims, and the
mating surfaces with Permatex Ultra-Grey or Black. You can install those
shims without talking apart the whole thing again. Just cut across them at
one point, coat with the Permatex silicone mentioned above, and place the
cut at the top, placing the gooped-up shim over onto the studs, and
sliding back to the tranny surface which is also coated lightly with the
silicone. Then coat the mating surface of the cover, and torque the nuts
to 14. No leaks ever. Ask me how I know.

Go to NAPA and buy the StaLube pump assembly that goes onto their 1 qt and
1 gallon GL-4 containers, also for sale at NAPA. Take 15 min under to bus
to fill completely. Remember you want 85 oz in the center, and 8.5 oz in
each redux box. Fill the boxes first, then lower them to operating
position, and fill the center transaxle.
