If you can spin the gears, see how many times you have to turn the
input side to make the stub axle (output side) turn 10 times.  The
two most common answers will be about 14 times and about 12.5 times,
but there are others.  You can also count the teeth on each gear to
figure this out.  This can usually be done without disassembly by
removing the oil fill and drain plugs.

If you do find a part number on them, check the manuals at
http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/ to figure out the application.

Good luck!
