well congratulations on hopefully fixing the misfire problem!

about the plastic fuel filters:  i have never had a plastic one break, come loose or explode in more than 15 years of vw driving.  if you look at the vintage bus archives about the supposed danger of using plastic filters, you'll find a whole mess of folks with similar (non-)experiences.  consensus, as i remember, is that glass filters are a waste of money.

that said, it is your bus and you need to feel comfortable about driving it!
