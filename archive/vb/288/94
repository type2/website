Subject: Re: [VB] solar panel battery?

Use it to keep 12v batteries topped up. I got a ciggy lighter socket from a junk yard and attached a couple of wires with spring clamps to affix to a battery. 
Use it to power a 12 fan to circulate air in a stuffy or humid vehicle. Find a muffin fan from an old computer or power supply. It'll power a store-bought 12v osclillating fan too. 

Matt Roberds might have something to say. 

Caution: It's possible to overcharge a car battery.
