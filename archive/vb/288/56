Subject: Re: [VB] Electric Heat?

Hello Guys  What I did in the Ghoost was mount a southwind gas heater under 
the jump seat ducted the intake and exhust out the front wheel well. hooked a 
10 ft.length of dryer vent hose to it . This way I could use the heat anywhere 
in the bus. Sking was great Pass the heater around, stick it in the ski boots, 
great !! Or white water canoeing in the wintertime get off the creek frozen 
beards fire the heater up pass the hose thawing out.  :)  Hey it made the old 
bus a true 12 month ride. Still driving this bus since 1971   Later and have 
fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service Salem Va.
