I have a bit to add to Cal's excellent advice:

If you do this, be careful of more acid coming out of the filler plugs
on the top.  Older batteries have three or six little screw caps; newer
ones often have two flat rectangular panels that cover three cells each.
Some batteries are "maintenance free" and there isn't any way to fill
the cells, but most batteries have removable plugs.  Usually it won't
just gush out of the plugs, but they aren't liquid tight and a little
will come out.

If the crack is near the top of the battery, you may be able to stop
the leak from the crack by propping it up at an angle with a piece of
wood under it.

Have a box of baking soda and plenty of water handy while you're fooling
with this.  The water helps you rinse acid off of yourself and the baking
soda will neutralize any remaining acid.  Safety goggles and gloves are
also your friends.
