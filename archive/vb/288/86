It's possible, I guess.  The Sunpro analog ones I have used (one the same
as the link I posted, and one that is a bit fancier and has more features)
don't seem to have any trouble with my 6 V '64.  I've never tried a digital
one on a 6 V car, but I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't work; by the
time most consumer-level digital tach/dwell meters hit the market, even
VWs hadn't been 6 V for 25 or 30 years, so the designers may not have
thought of it.

You know this already, but you are connecting to the thin wire between the
coil and the distributor, right?  OK, OK, I had to ask.

Most analog dwell meters I have seen only have two leads - signal and
ground (earth).  If yours has three leads - power, signal, and ground -
it _might_ work if you connected the power wire to something over 6 V.
You could try any 12 V battery, but a small one (ie not a car battery)
is preferable.  Connect the 12 V battery negative terminal to ground
in your Bus, and connect the power wire of your dwell meter to the 12 V
battery positive terminal.  Connect the signal wire to the coil-distributor
wire as usual.  Even a 9 V "transistor radio" battery (rectangular, with
two snap connectors on top) might work for this.  This might work, or
it might not work, or it might fry your meter, so proceed with care.
