During this time of year my gloves, wool coat and Russian cap are
standard wear. The heater does eventually warm the cab up in town,
faster on the highway. Fortunately I don't have to heat a whole bus!

Instead of an electric heater, consider a pair of quality thermal
underwear. Seriously. And some decent gloves. And a knit cap. Maybe
even a nice down jacket that covers your seat while you drive.
