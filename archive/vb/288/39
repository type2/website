Subject: Re: [VB] Electric Heat?

But, my stock heating system works very well (after replumbing and
insulating (used foil backed ceramic wool) all the hard ducting and using galvanized exhaust piping to replace the long center heat tunnel)and insulating behind all the interior panels so all I want to do is provide Supplemental heating to my stock system thus the small electric unit.
