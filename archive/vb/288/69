http://www.wixfilters.com/ has a cross-reference guide.
It doesn't like the spaces, but putting in 0451102056
crosses it to a Wix 51374 - about 3.5" tall, 3" diameter,
3/4-16 thread.  See
http://www.wixfilters.com/filterlookup/PartDetail.asp?Part=51374
for all the details.  NAPA usually sells Wix filters.
