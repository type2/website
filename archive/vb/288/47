Subject: Re: [VB] Electric Heat?

Eric is describing the 'pop bottle effect', you can't blow into a pop bottle, it can't go anywhere.   I subscribe to the 'leaky paper bag effect' theory', as my buses have rust holes and drafts, and it seems colder with the vent wing cracked open.   

Other peoples buses may well have fewer holes and newer seals.

I just added insulation to the main heat tube of my 61 deluxe, which helps.  It's over the old oem insulation.  I'd like to put more on, somehow, but prolly not over the bare tube, so some more heat tolerant insulation would have to be found.  I have seen insulation on heater boxes, too.  hm....
