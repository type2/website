... mine is close, but i found a new winner!
at a record swap this weekend i ran across a fried-egg singlecab - 9+ 
different paint colors, homemade pipe rack, 2 qt sump (COVERED in 
leaked oil), front turn signals replaced by some trailer lenses, and 
the back... well, i'm just sorry i didn't have a camera. 3 different 
lenses, none stock; even the stock HOLE was gone! historic plates 
issued in 77, but current tags.
if this was you, fess up! and get ahold of my by pmail; we'll go 
record hunting!
