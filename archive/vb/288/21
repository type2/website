They should be okay in the long run, for the next few weeks, it's not going
to be a whole lot of fun. I assume they had insurance and kept track of
inventory. I can't see the insurance company trying to give them too much
fuss for thier claim (Normally, a business burning down get's investigated
for arson, but this one's a no brainer that it's not). If there's a silver
lining, here it is: They just got rid of all their old stock that might not
have been moving very fast. Anyone that owns or runs a business knows,
there's always that one (or more) dusty shelf of parts that don't sell or
move quite as good as you first thought they would when you bought what
ended up being too many.

It still sucks that it happened to them, but it looks like it could have
been a lot worse if the building would have gone down as well (Horray for
brick buildings!). This will slow them down for a little while, that's for
sure, but hopefully they can get back up to full speed as soon as possible.
We wish them a speedy recovery. They should be able to keep business going,
obviously some things are going to be on backorder for a couple weeks
though.
