I second her experience.   But I route the fuel line so it's long enough to hang the filter away from the wires (on the left side of the coil) anyway. 

 Though I wouldn't want to cut the original metal tubes either.  In my 53 I added the filter bewteen the tank and the engine to leave the original metal lines and screw fittings alone, but that's real easy as the tank's in the engine compartment and I can still see it.   I don't like filters where you can't see them, especially if the DPO doesn't tell you they're there, but between the tank and the engine might be the best place.  And if your fuel tap works you can turn it off when you change the filter.  I use clamps on the fuel line everywhere it's under pressure, but not where it's not.  Works great with correct size fuel line. 

Other thing is, if the bus has been sitting a while, tanks get rust.   I've sewed a magnet into a bag and attached it to a wire coat hanger than goes down the filler neck, bend wire around neck so it doesn't disappear.   Take it out when you put gas in and knock the rust off the bag.   When it stays clean, leave it in the garage for the next resurrected bus.   Idea from my brother Barnaby (the big guy at the right of the picture on this webpage:)
