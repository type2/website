Subject: tied-dyed keysRe: [VB] Steal Your Face tees are in

When I was at the hardware store recently they had tie dyed keys!!!! and ones with flowers and smiley faces on.  of course, I had to get one.   How cool would it be to have a tie-dyed VW key?    

I dunno how they folded the key, but it flattened out and works fine.
