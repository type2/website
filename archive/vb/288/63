Hi Eric,
We buy type 3 heater boxes and install the insulation blankets off of these 
onto our type1/2 heater boxes.  Only a small cut needs to be made to the 
insulation blankets to work around the type1/2 heater cable linkage.  Noticable heat 
increasement and no noticable rasing of oil temps during hot weather.
