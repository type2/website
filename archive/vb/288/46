Subject: Re: [VB] Electric Heat?

I think that I've got the answer to my Q, that is, forget the load that the electric heater will put on the electric charging system, the electric heater don't put out dip for actual heat. and I agree, cracking a window, but I do put the slider into the first notch, helps with the heating system being a single pass system this helps prevent pressurizing the bus!
