Subject: disc brakes

Hi i have a stock 1967 standard stock bus and I need to stop quicker. 
Before I add any power I need to get the brakes in order. I believe the 
stock brakes are working correctly.  

Does anyone have experience with disc brakes. I bought a book with a 
title about suspension and brakes for busses. The author listed several 
resources.
thank you frank
