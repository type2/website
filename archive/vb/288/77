Subject: Re: [VB] point gap - who is right???

 Ive never seen a mention of of anything smaller then .016 but as others have mentioned .016 is just
a starting point anyway. Have you been running your gap at .009? If so, what is your dwell?

the purpose of my post was just to see what the common thought on the starting point for brand new
009 points was.Well i set my brand new points at what i thought was a good .016 and when all was
said and done it ended up feeling like .019. So I just went ahead and hooked it up to my dwell meter
anyway and it is still  reading 50 degrees right on the money. I wonder what the change per .001 is
to dwell degree on the average? Maybe im getting too technical.

As someone mentioned offlist, you may have to end up setting it at a weird setting if you have
low-end wear.
