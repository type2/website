Hi Kelly,
The 1/4" is normal and the reason why the FW gland nut has the needle bearing 
setup in it to support the rear of the input shaft.  No, it is not enough to 
know if the tranny is good.  Only two ways to find out.  Take apart tranny and 
inspect with tranny rebuilder experience, or install in bus and see if it 
works.
