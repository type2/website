Subject: Re: [VB] Electric Heat?

If your stock system is working fine-the addition of the 300 btu's won't
add anything more that you could really notice.

Don't tax the antique electrical system with an unnecessary overload--

The 12 volt heater/ defrosters barley have enough heat in them to
defrost a windshield let alone produce enough heat in your Bus to be of
any real benefit--

Go ahead--try it--see what happens--

You be the judge--:>)
