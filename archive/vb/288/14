You want "Volkswagen Transporter Workshop Manual 1963-1967" by Bentley
Publishers. VW part number LPV 800 135, Bentley stock number V267,
ISBN 0-8376-0391-9.

>me confusedthat there may be 2.

The original _factory_ manual was a two-volume set, but as far as I know,
these aren't reprinted.  Sometimes you can score them on Ebay, or on
TheSamba.com, etc.  The one-volume book listed above, an abbreviation of
the two-volume set, is what the VW dealers had "back in the day".

In the last year, Bentley has also reprinted the one-volume shop manual
for early Buses, '50-'62.  Everything you _need_ will be in the '63-'67
book, but if you like books, you can buy this one too.

The only thing wrong with the reprints is that they are all B&W, while
the originals had some color pages.  Thom provides the wiring diagrams
(mostly scanned from original manuals) in color at

>what is the going price? from whom

Going price around $70 for the '63-'67 manual last time I looked; Old
Volks (Ronnie) and Bus Depot (Ron) sell them.  The '50-'62 manual will
be a little more expensive.

>I have a catalog that lists photo copies for 20$-might I consider that?

Depends on what they're selling copies of, but that's probably hard to
find out before you buy.  If you want, spend the $20, and try to get a
physical address from the seller.  If it turns out to be a copy of the
same manual Bentley is reprinting, forward the seller's info to Bentley
for busting purposes.  If it turns out to be a copy of the two-volume
factory manual, then it's probably worth the $20.

>Does any ony know of a source for old advertisements-I have a centerfold
>ad with an elephant in a bus- looking for more of this type stuff

At VW shows, some people have ones they've cut from old magazines.  You
can do the same by scoping garage sales, etc, for collections of old
magazines (Time, Life, etc) and looking for the ads.
