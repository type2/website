Subject: Re: [VB] side scoops any opinions

You have a cooler mounted over the intake vents inside a scoop? I think that would "pre-heat" the air going into your engine compartment thus robbing your engine of cooler air. When I ran an external cooler I mounted it above the tranasaxle with good results.

To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no choreography, and the dancers hit each other.
