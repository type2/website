Subject: Stolen shipping container

I received this email from BBT this morning.
Hopefully somebody can help.


Dear VW Friends all over the globe,

I just putted back my Email group together last week and I think I needed
badly already today...

Last night a full 40 foot container with only spare parts for aircooled VW's
dissapeared somewhere between Antwerp Docks and the BBT parking lot...it was
loaded on a trailer... that is all we know up to now.

I want everybody to keep attention when somebody offers You parts in larger
quantity's at low prices... the container was overfull with all
goodies...mainly performance parts and upholstery parts.

The person that can give information that can lead to finding back our
container or the what was in it can count on a nice gift from BBT and the
insurance company!

Plse spread the word and I hope we can cooperate all to find back this load
of spare parts!

Thanks for joining, I keep You posted over this group when something should
come out!

Keep the VW faith!
