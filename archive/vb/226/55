Subject: correct carb for 67 1500

would anyone know the correct carb for my stock 1967 1500.  I have a 
brand new 30/31 pict iguess that is the factory replacemenr (from past 
owner)I even have the governer. sometimes it is fun because it 
mechanically limits engine speed-in any gear. it will go 62 mph
