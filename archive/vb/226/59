Hi Magicbus,
Hmm, the "Without Guesswork" for 1960-1970 lists the type 3 1500S engine as 
having 113-156 PSI compression.  Most of the other engines had 100-142 PSI, 
so your copression gauge could be reading a tad high.  It does not list CR, 
but does list that the max differance between cylinders for any engine of the 
period is 28 PSI.
