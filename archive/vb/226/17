Hey Bart,

Long time no see.....I had a beater 62 Singlecab a few years ago and did that 
thing.  I picked up a cheap universal antenna from Radio Shack and laid it in 
the parcel tray.  It worked great.  I lived in Vegas so the radio signals are 
strong.

Depending on how crazy you want to get you could try this.  With my 2 limos 
at work, we have the antennas that mount under the headliner.  Reception 
isn't super but it is sufficient.  When I get back to work on Weds. I will 
take a look and try to get you a dealer and prices.

Most of the window mount antennas suck major ass.
