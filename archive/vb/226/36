Subject: I just watched my neighbor's carport/garage burn down

Hi,

A tip. You should have a fire extinguisher handy if you work on your 
car. My neighbor was working on his 'ol Ford truck tonight - and ended 
up torching his carport/garage. I think he was trying to get the engine 
started, I heard a couple of backfires - then wooof (that sound that 
makes your hair raise up).

I have a fire extinguisher, charged, near my VW just in case. When my 
bus was my daily driver many, many years ago - I also had one next to 
my driver's seat.

Anyways, just thought I'd pass that along. Stay safe.

Conrad
