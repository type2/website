Subject: Ceramics in VW engines.

I've been reading about low power, leaking heads, overheating of VW vans
of all types for about three years.
I am in the process of putting a package together for the home mechanic
with the skills to rebuild an engine that consist of several Ceramic
compounds that will enable the home rebuilder mechanic to apply ceramic
coatings on Cylinder Heads, Exhaust Ports, Rocker Shafts, Piston Tops,
Piston Sides, Valve tops and stems, Cylinder Bores, Lifters and Cams.
Many other applications can also be made on your VW engine to bring it
into cool running, higher performance, more dependable with better fuel
economy. The strangest thing is that most of these compounds can be
applied by baking at from 350 to 550 degrees in your home kitchen oven
for about an hour.
I'll be putting up a web site soon with all of the details and prices on
the do it yourself materials.
In the interim period I have purchased a large commercial kiln, a bead
blaster, large compressor and allied equipment to perform professional
Ceramic Coatings Services. The shop set up might take another 30 days but
I'm more that 80% invested in the equipment and am currently apprenticing
to perfect my application skills.
I'll make a posting when I get everything in order to start doing
business with full service coatings.

Thanks
Stan Wilder
