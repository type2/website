If I set up everything correct I look for 90-105 lbs on new rings and 115-125
lbs after the rings have set and the 500 mile retorque.

what compression ratio are you folks using and what compression numbers
are you getting with a compression tester.  My 1967 1500 is coming up
150 psi-that seems too high. I did not build this engine but the last
engine I built I set the compression to 7.5:1 and got about 110 on the
gauge.
