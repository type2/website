What kind of vw volks are you hanging out with?

I never even  worry about my Blaupunkt(sp?) CD changer mounted in the
package tray EVEN at California shows.  I do take the face plate off to
avoid temptation some times.

Hmmmm, wonder where I put that thing???? If I ever find it,  & if I get the
DC running again I'll be able to listen to some music!

Tom Buese-replacing wiring harness now-radio least of my worries
