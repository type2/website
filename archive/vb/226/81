Subject: Re: [VB] side scoops any opinions

My opinion is that the air does not flow over the bus skin like it flows over an 
SR71. The bus nose pushes it away and then the air gets pushed back toward the 
bus, hitting it at an angle less than 90 and more than 0. Anything blocking that 
in-rush of air is Not Good. 




Also, some scoops DECREASE the amount of air that can be drawn through the 
grills. Measure the square inches of the scoop and compare to the square inches 
of the grill openings. If it's less, it's a constriction. 




Anybody have the open area of the grills in sq. inches?




So a scoop completely covering the grills as seen from the side would be less 
effective than one covering half the grill area if my seat-of-the-pants 
aerodynamics mean anything.
