Ya, I've noticed that too over the years, but I haven't seen anything in the
books to show that there were different lengths. I mean, after all, the
dimensions between the bottom of the fan housing to the thermostat were the
same for all 1300-1600 blocks. Eric and Barb say that those dimensions also
follow on the 25,36, and 40 hp although I have to take their word for that.

one thing i have noticed varying - the little actuator lever that
passes thru the heads! some are different lengths, and some are bent
different distances along the rod, or in a different direction.
possibly POs with a pair of pliers, but something to consider!
