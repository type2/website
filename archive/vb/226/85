Subject: oversized pulley (was porsche pulley)

I bought the oversized pully that was advertised in VW Trends.

My assessment:

1) the pulley was stamped backwards: 0 deg (TDC) was marked as 180 deg
2) tin modification is required
3) I have noticed lower head temps, but this could have been other factors  
4) I have noticed reduced SOP horsepower 
	(SOP = Seat Of Pants, i.e. it doesn't feel as "get-up and go-y")
5) Oil temps have not been too much lower, perhaps 5 deg (tops)

Other factors:  
The reduced head temps could have easily been a result of the new (used) 
head that I installed at the same time to replace a cracked head and/or 
the aftermarket "cool tin" which I installed.  These could also affect the 
oil temp, as I was ALWAYS running 375-425 head temps, which, in my opinion 
is both too high and going to result in higher oil temps.

I have read other similar assessments that basically say: the engine is 
more loaded (turning the fan more times), so you have less power and the
engine has to work harder to make you go the same speeds as previous.

Would I do it again?  Not sure.  I would probably spend the money first on 
converting to a dog-house or dog-house with type-IV oil cooler 
modification first.  (Which I already have done)

To be honest, I'm not convinced that the "cool tin" or the bigger pulley 
result in cooler running.  The only mods I have witnessed that I think 
improve the stock type-1 engine are:
    1) full flow filter (with a <15 micron filter):
	~$150 after tapping case and using a reputable kit (Hoover 
		reports	that many kits leak. I'd go berg or 
		vintageperformance.net)
    2) type-IV oil cooler modification:
	~$200 for a cooler and the berg kit

However, if you can get the "cool tins" cheap (or make them) (I got mine 
for free), I say: "Why not?"...
