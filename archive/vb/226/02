From long experience with motorcycle windshields, I've discovered that the
only way to clean them without scratches is to cover them with paper
towels, soak down with plain water (distilled if you have a lab distiller
handy) and wait.  After an hour, everything that can be softened will be.
Wipe the windshield with a soft cloth (cotton diaper is ideal) but never
use any force against the material or wipe the surface twice with the same
surface of the cloth.

Using this method, I can usually get two or three years out of a
windshield before it gets scratched.  It usually gets scratched because
some "helpful" individual decides to clean it as if it were glass.
