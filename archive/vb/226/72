I would argue that while the later busses do have a "scoop" to the intake vents they still are not as drastic as the after market scoops. If I remember correctly the actual vent area is not all that different from a split in terms of area and they may have been "scooped" more because they are on a rounded part of the body and in a different (higher) location. But then again I am not an engineer I am going mostly on aesthetics here. 

There was a time when people thought mounting a cooler over the vents was a good idea or even mounting one on the back of the fan shroud over the fan! 

It could also be said that Bay Window vents are not as visually appealing as those found on a pre-68 bus, but I would never comment on that in a public forum for fear of starting a split vs.bay war. :)

To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no choreography, and the dancers hit each other.
