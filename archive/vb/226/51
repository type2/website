The inside shouldn't be too difficult to find unless you're a real
stickler for originality.  Here are some pics of one on Bigbulli
http://www.stainsby.force9.co.uk/my_westy/09290004.jpg   I think its
just a grounded two outlet plug with an alum. face plate.  The exterior
one  (you can just see the bottom of this one in the picture)
http://www.stainsby.force9.co.uk/my_westy/01060004.jpg will be a bit
tougher to find original, but a suitable one should'nt be a problem at
an RV store. 

BTW '65 and I think '66 SO42's (could be just '65 though) had the plug
on the left rear corner.  In '67 it moved up to the long driver's side
just aft of the drivers door.
