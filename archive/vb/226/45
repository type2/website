i've had one end tweaked just enough  out of true to cause that head 
to not seal right. a pipe and a nearby tree for leverage fixed it :)
also, a big mystery was solved once when we found a manifold that 
HELD water when cold, but when hot the seam between the heat riser 
and manifold tube would open up and start leaking!
