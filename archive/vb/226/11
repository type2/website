Subject: FW: Eureka! I think I found the idleing issue

This whole 8.3 HG of vac at idle had me miffed, should have more....But, I
know think I know why, which some empirical testing should prove. My SP
manifold MUST be bent. The old motor's passanger head was so flycut, the
engine was narrower, so I believe it got bent in some when it was torqued
sdown on the poor old engine, and now doesn't seal 100% on a properly built
mill. Will test with WD-40, and confirm this, but I do believe the spare
manifold has to come out and get installed.

If this sounds ridiculous, let me know, but I do believe that a lean
calculated AF, with hight 02, and high HC, should point to a small intake
manifold leak, where running under speed to produce vac, and enough
enrichment and idle speed produces a posisble, but dirty idle. This seems to
be the only permutation of events to lead to these numbers.

I am going to look for plans to build my own budget analyzer, thing lots of
serial devices to a pc, inspired form a multimeter with tach dwell I saw
with rs232. Add exhuast agas analysis and vaccum, recorded as snapshots, and
I've got it... :)

Thanks for all the help with jet numbers and suggestions, I think this will
all fall into place soon. At least she'll still running cool, but now parked
until further diagnosis. Crossing fingers for weather to hold up.
