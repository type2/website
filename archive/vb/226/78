I should revise my statement based on this and other counter points.

We cannot say the scoops don't work well because VW didn't put them on
busses. A later design (read bay window) included a style of scoop
that may be a result of a design improvement, a necessary change to
satisfy the relocation of the fresh air vents or an astetic choice.
The only way to say if this scoop design works on split windows is to
test & verify. 

That being said, I sure don't like the look, but might think it funny
to see one that looked like jet engines. You know kinda a swamp cooler
type housing on a pylon :)
