Wow, if your heads are flycut that much that it narrowed your engine so much
you needed to bend the intake, your CR must be through the roof! A standard
set of P/S and a standard CC on your heads will come real close to the proper
CR. Lower the CC in your heads and the CR goes up. Also you valve train
geometry changes. Hope you took all that into account when you put on flycut
heads. I always use cylinder shims the thickness of the material cut into the
heads to restore correct geometry. Of course, flycut heads are weaker than
having all the meat there. Touching up the surface a couple of thousands is
not a problem to take away barrel hammer marks.

This whole 8.3 HG of vac at idle had me miffed, should have more....But, I
know think I know why, which some empirical testing should prove. My SP
manifold MUST be bent. The old motor's passanger head was so flycut, the
engine was narrower, so I believe it got bent in some when it was torqued
sdown on the poor old engine, and now doesn't seal 100% on a properly built
mill. Will test with WD-40, and confirm this, but I do believe the spare
manifold has to come out and get installed.

If this sounds ridiculous, let me know, but I do believe that a lean
calculated AF, with hight 02, and high HC, should point to a small intake
manifold leak, where running under speed to produce vac, and enough
enrichment and idle speed produces a posisble, but dirty idle. This seems to
be the only permutation of events to lead to these numbers.

I am going to look for plans to build my own budget analyzer, thing lots of
serial devices to a pc, inspired form a multimeter with tach dwell I saw
with rs232. Add exhuast agas analysis and vaccum, recorded as snapshots, and
I've got it... :)

Thanks for all the help with jet numbers and suggestions, I think this will
all fall into place soon. At least she'll still running cool, but now parked
until further diagnosis. Crossing fingers for weather to hold up.
