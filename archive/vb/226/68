Subject: RB/KP or wedding

     Looks like I won't be at the RB/KP weekend fest. One of my best friends
(and I don't have very many <:?) is getting married on the 12th of April and
I would be dead meat if I missed his wedding. 
     So for all of you wanting me to bring parts they will have to be
shipped and those wanting to get stuff from me there will have to order it. 
     I hate to miss it, but family before VW friends.
