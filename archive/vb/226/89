Lke I said I am no engineer but....

I run a balanced 1600 SP that is full flowed, Doghoused and is basically stock. I also have a Freeway Flyer trans and I have never overheated or had a problem related to cooling or a lack of cooling. 

I cannot find info on the doghouse either but I remember it being a very significant increase in the volume of air it moves in comparrison to the earlier fans. 21 cubic feet per something at some rpm or something like that, I forget. (and I more than likely will catch hell for that comment!) 

I suppose all bets could be off if you are running larger than stock engines However, in the same bus I have now I ran a 1914cc (stock valve train, dual Kadrons) with an external cooler mounted under the bus and never had a problem cooling it. I have a SO-42 Westy by the way, so I'm pushing a lot of weight. Preserving the transaxle was a different story but unrelated! 

The 1500 was an option a few years before '66 (1963 I think) but I think the design change may have had more to do with safety regulations than it did with cooling designs. Were the new design of the bus made because of cooling issues than why did the doghouse not appear before 1971 on earlier bay window's that had 1600 SP engines, but had the new vents? 

Assuming your tin is all present and your seals are good isn't the engine compartment already pressurized leaving the air nowhere to go but out the shroud and cylinder tin? 

Now I am rambling.....and rambling.....and
