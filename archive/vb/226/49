Subject: compression ratio and psi

what compression ratio are you folks using and what compression numbers 
are you getting with a compression tester.  My 1967 1500 is coming up 
150 psi-that seems too high. I did not build this engine but the last 
engine I built I set the compression to 7.5:1 and got about 110 on the 
gauge.
