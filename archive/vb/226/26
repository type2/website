I always use cylinder shims the thickness of the material cut into the
heads to restore correct geometry.

Use a piece of soft hollow core solder and turn the engine over TDC
crushing the solder.
It will give you a measure of your piston to head clearance and try to
get all 4 the same by using shims.
