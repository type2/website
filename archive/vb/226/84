If your bus had needed them VW would have put them there. That said, I
thinknthey are ugly, unless of course they are made out of cooking pans
in a Martha Stewart-like style!

I've got a big 10" x10" x 2" oil cooler in there and the scoop helps to
force air through the cooler.
It has some utility if you need them.
