I think the oversize refers to the center where the pulley bolts to the
crank, not the rim where the belt goes.  50 mm is only about 2", not the
6"+ diameter of most pulleys.  I can't find the reference right now, but
I seem to remember a note in the Bentley that when the crankshaft is
reground, the oil return thread on the back of the crankshaft is also
changed and you have to put on a different pulley to match.  I think
that's what the "oversize" pulleys are for.
