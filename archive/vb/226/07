Subject: Bus Model numbers

I have a RHD bus with right side cargo doors, the model number on the m 
code plate is 214, while every "decoder" I've seen has 214 as being RHD 
cargo doors left.
Also my Bus is a walkthru which on some decoders is 183 while others 
have 183 as being "divided"

I also can't find 762 or 008 in any decoder.

 Anyone have another source for decoders?

The Samba, and VintageBus are the two I use regularly. But in this case 
they are much help.

Greg
