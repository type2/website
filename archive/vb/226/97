Bzzzzzt!  Wrong!

Take a closer look at the "scoops" on a baywindow.  The opening is only a
few degrees away from being flat to the sides of the bus.  No ram effect
there!

Before you gotch up your bus with scoops, figure out why the cooling
system isn't working properly.  Scoops won't fix bad seals, missing tin,
etc.
