Subject: differential side gear removal

Grrrr. So apparently I'm doing something wrong. the bentley says
"remove differential side gear & fulcrum plates from differential
housing". Well that sure isn't much direction. Does anyone have any
suggestions for getting the blankty blank blank side gear out? It does
not want to simply slide out of my differential and I havent seen any
good way to get ahold of it to get it out. I tried the lazy mans way
of just putting the axle back in w/ fulcrum plates while in the
tranny, but that is even more hopeless. Hopefully I'm having a bad day
& it's easy, I just haven't had any luck. TIA
