I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you...

I keep the NEATO Old Bus Registry which has over 1,100 buses and over
600 M-Code tags.  I looked at the data to see what I could see.  No, I
don't know what 008 is, but there are eight buses in my database with
008 and one of them also has 762.  The buses have some interesting
characteristics and it may just be that your bus is a 214-RHD, but the
008 M-Code overrides the "cargo doors left" model.  Here's what I have:

20-080.630 (8 Apr 1954) Model 224 Standard, shipped to EN (England,
Ramsgate)
434.109 (30 Jan 1959) Model 244 Deluxe, Shipped to SF (South Africa?)
653.308 (12 Sep 1960) Model 224 shipped to NY (Norway, port unknown)
775.052 (6 May 1961) Model 271, Ambulance, shipped to NO (Norway, Oslo)
Military
1.298.728 (21 May 1964) Model 2711 Ambulance, shipped to NO (Norway,
Oslo) 
235.151.366 (15 May 1965) Model unknown, shipped to SZ (Switzerland)
275.170.069 (30 June 1965) Model 271, Ambulance, shipped to SZ
(Switzerland)
216.169.593 (27 June 1966) Model unknown, shipped to SZ (Switzerland)
Also has 762

I would certainly take your M-Code tag codes to add to my collection of
data.  I worked with Dave Eccles to help out on his book the "Spec
Guide" and always welcome the information from other people's buses.
