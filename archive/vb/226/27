Subject: Re: [VB] Internal Radio Antenna?

I've got the glass mount type antennae. Its basically a wire in a clear scotch 
tape type stuff. I have it adhered to the inside of my dash. You can't see it, 
but it does get sucky reception. Luckily the only station I can get happens to 
be my favorite.  Part of it may be my Radio Smack AM/FM cassette. It sucks too, 
but for $25 and fitting in the stock radio hole I'm not complaining. Heck, it's 
cheaper than a block-off plate and plays my Joy Division, Violent Femmes and 
other 80's favs!
