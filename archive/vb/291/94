You're running a 31 PICT on a 2007cc ? What, ya got the main to 160 or
something? Must be really flat on the start line.

Now if you were to properly ventilate it, I'd go with a E-100 for mild
hauling.

67 Single Cab, DP 1641cc 34 PICT-3 (Thumper)
71 Trike 1776cc Dual T-4 34 PDSIT-3
VolksAir 1585cc 31 PICT

Just wondering what cam you all like for a heavy Westi?

I am leaning towards the plain jane stocker, but would not mind a little

hotter mild cam if it does not kill the torque needed for a heavy beast
of
burden :)

This is for a 2007cc Type1 running a 30PICT carb with DP heads heat
boxes
with a header and fat boy.

Thanks,
