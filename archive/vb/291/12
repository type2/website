My 65 crewcab was just like that, tons of flow out the bottom vents and
hardly a wisp of air from the top. Turned out to be a paper wasps nest
clogging the riser.

so since it's the yearly heat talk I though I would ask this. I have the
stock heat in pretty darn good shape. There is a decent amount of air
flow that comes out the front bottom vents and it's quite warm. What
does puzzle me is the defrosters seem almost completely useless. Then I
flip the lever on the heat riser tube I does allow some air into the
defroster diffusers, but it's really more like a flea fart of air. Is
this typical or do I need to invest some more time into looking. I tried
fishing down the ducts to see if anything was blocking the airflow, but
no luck.
