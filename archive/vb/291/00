Subject: Re: [VB] ambulance identification

Ivory was available on commercial type 2s from march 53 through 67.  not the most common colour, but yes, it was used on more than ambulances.

ambulances were type 27, which should be on the metal tag in the engine compartment 'typ27' 
If it says 'typ 23' it's a kombi.

they came with gas guages, and side windows frosted 3/4 of the way up, and jailbars, and fold down back hatches.  even if the overhead fans are gone, look for the wiring. oh, they came with a sliding glass partition between front and back, and some extra buttons for buzzers in the back.
