Really Raymond? 

Time? 
Boy--let see----it must have taken me all of 15 minutes to get this
simple job done--prior to installing the rear shoes-- 

Resources? 
You have a sanding block and some 80 grit sandpaper? 

I use a DA--and some 80 --- this is all it takes--sand the shoe to fit
the radius of the drum-- 

Pretty simple--and just some good old fashioned common sense will do-- 

Just run the flat sanding block ( or DA, or an electric sander will do )
and run it over the shoe until it seat onto the drums surface flush-- 

It's a done deal--and no multiple brake adjustments--no burning one
section of the shoes while your waiting for them to seat themselves.

Not everyone has the time, resources, or know how to properly radius a
set of brake shoes. It's far easier, though time consuming, to just let
them wear into the drums and adjust them a couple of times.

This is why a guy should take the time to radius the shoes prior to
installing them-- The contact area willbe 100 % right from the get
go--and you'd ony have to re- adjust them after a day or two--and then
that's it--
