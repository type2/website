Subject: Re: [VB] Re:RGBox bolts [VB] There REALLY IS a point here, I

Tightened the bolts - only was was noticibly loose though.  The nice
mechanic must have done a quick tighten job while he was under there, but
missed this one.  The broken one is on the drivers side.  The one bolt that
is stands alone.  Maybe tomorrow we will work at getting it out.  Or maybe I
need to BEG someone in this group to send me the bolt if they have a spare,
I will be happy to pay for it and the postage.  Any volunteers ?

PS .. I noticed in the picture, it only shows a total of 3 bolts per side,
where there is actually 4.
