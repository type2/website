I tink it's time to do some real diagnosis on it. Get out your VOM and
start checking for voltage. except for the wire going to the points
(and it may be) every connection should receive 12v when working and
on. so trace through the wires and find if you are loosing power at
one point or not. then you can isolate or eliminate that problem and
tackle more.
