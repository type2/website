Hi Eric,
The engine might not overheat, but will run 30F higher oil temp in warm 
weather!    Seems the ehaust gases out of #3 & 1 cylinder are cooled by the minute 
amount of air passed through the heat exchangers when they are shut off.  
Without this the exhaust gases keep expanding and cause too much back pressure 
against those cylinders and increase overall engine temps.  BTDT!
