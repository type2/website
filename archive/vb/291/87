Subject: Re: [VB] Heater Box?

Both cable ends connect to the knob. The heater cable is just one long cable
bent in the middle at the knob. When you turn the knob one way, it pulls the
cable ends back, when you turn it the other way it pushes the cable ends
out. Simple hunh?

Unscrew the knob using the knurled nut below the handle and pull it out.
Once you've done this, you will be able to see how it works.

OK, I got the heater boxes in, PITA w/o removing the engine.  The upper
bolts
on the heater boxes were hard to get to.   I've got the cables connected.
But
I'm having a hard time with the one on the right.  I think it is the one
that
connects to the knob???  Is this correct?  Also how does that knob work?  As
in where does the cable connect and which way do I turn it to get heat and
to
loosen it?  I took the seat out, took the pedal pan off and I can't see
anything.
