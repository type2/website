the latches changed in 67 from the 90 degree bend in the end where you grab
it to a curved end. I was told once that was a 67 only latch but holding
them side by side they looked the same as the latches on my 68 single cab
did to me.

for it from a Canadian dealership.  Another friend she has a double bubble
truck.  are the bay truck latches the same as the splitty ones?  I have no
idea.
