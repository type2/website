Be careful what you wish for!  Some car manufacturers that have set up
their own Vintage parts programs (largely using aftermarket parts that
they "approved" for sale under their name, not original parts), and then
proceeded to crack down on aftermarket sales of the same parts -
effectively allowing them to largely monopolize the vintage parts
market. The net result was higher parts prices due to lack of
competition, but no significant improvement in quality or selection. (Of
course, this is different from companies that have supported their old
cars all along, and have produced new factory parts for old models on an
ongoing basis.)
