Hi Angus,

If the weather is cool where you are then not having the thermostat is part 
of your MPG problem.  Causing the engine not getting up to a proper operating 
temp and thusly the pistons and the rings are not swelling to the proper size 
to seal properly.  You should wire in temporarly a tachometer, grab a passenger 
to watch the gauge and write down the results of where 1,500 and 3,000 RPM is 
at what MPH in all forward gears.  Go below 1,500 RPM especially in 2-4th 
gear and damage the main bearings by shoving the crankshaft into them.  Go above 
3,000 RPM get alot less MPG, about only 1/3 to 1/2 engine lifespan and 
overheating especially during warm weather.  Also check the smell of the oil on the 
dipstick.  If is smells badly of fuel shortly after an oil change and you are 
running a mechanical fuel pump its diaphram is probably leaking into the engine 
case.  If you have an electrical fuel pump without a pressure regulator or 
one that is not adjusted low enough it will over pressurize the carb float and 
spraying excess fuel down the throat of the intakes.  Could also be your carbs 
are badly jetted!
BTW  Did you figure out which engine you have?
