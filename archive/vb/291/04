Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Need help locating a stock looking Bus for a VW 

My experience is that some VW places are better about this than others. VW
does still stock some parts and I have gotten stuff from them. I think the
problem is that the parts guy has to pull out microfische and look up parts
the old fashioned way. They can't just look it up on the computer like they
can with new parts.

Ususally the younger the guy behind the counter the more likely you are
going to get blown off.

I went in and asked about a part for my '95...yes you read that right
'95 VW, and was told "gee...hmmm that might be too old"  What a POS company.
