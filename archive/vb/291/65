Now, back to the problem at hand, what can a guy do if the springs are
missing (as mine are) and maybe Tom's are?  I find I have to adjust my rear
brakes ('70 Westfalia) about once every month or so to keep the pedal high
and the E-brake functional.  Do I have to find new backing plates, or can I
just find the little springs and mount them?
Thanks,
Paul
