Subject: RGB mount bolt hole threads

Trying to clean up the RGB bolt hole threads I found 2 mabey 3 that are 
unusable. The stock thread size is 12mm-1.50. Anyone out there know the first 
oversize tap I will need to purchase to make some threads in these babies and mabey 
some insider tips from those who have been there and done that?
