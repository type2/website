The little puffs of partially warm air are so welcome on these frosty

thanks to everyone for suggesting taking a second look at the apparent
blockage. I put a wire fish down the drivers side again and got nothing.
However this time I put it down the pass side as well. turns out there
was a huge clump of insulation in the pathway. I now have nice defroster
heat :)
