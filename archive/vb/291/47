Not everyone has the time, resources, or know how to properly radius a
set of brake shoes. It's far easier, though time consuming, to just let
them wear into the drums and adjust them a couple of times.

This is why a guy should take the time to radius the shoes prior to
installing them-- The contact area willbe 100 % right from the get
go--and you'd ony have to re- adjust them after a day or two--and then
that's it--
