Really Raymond?

Time?
Boy--let see----it must have taken me all of 15 minutes to get this
simple job done--prior to installing the rear shoes--

Resources?
You have a sanding block and some 80 grit sandpaper?

I use a DA--and some 80 --- this is all it takes--sand the shoe to fit
the radius of the drum-- Pretty simple--and just some good old fashioned
common sense will do--

Just run the flat sanding block ( or DA, or an electric sander will do )
and run it over the shoe until it seat onto the drums surface flush--

It's a done deal--and no multiple brake adjustments--no burning one
section of the shoes while your waiting for them to seat themselves.
