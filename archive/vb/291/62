That said,, I agree with Rick, the are relatively safe heaters,, if they
have a rust hole in them,, or you fiddle with them long enough to get RAW
fuel leaking outside the heater,, you can have a flare up.. NOT an
explosion,,, the A/F mixture is tooo rich inside the heater, and outside
it is not contained

When you play with a gas heater,, if you see a puddle of gas,, don't make
a spark,,, also keep a fire extingusher handy, water the lawn before
lighting california on fire..... worse yet, don't burn a bus

Hope that helps
the more I can help out,, the more I can point out a really cool picture!
