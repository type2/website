I think loose reduction gear box bolts were suggested by more than one 
person. I know I mentioned it to you off list. It's one of the most 
obvious possible causes of a clunking sound as you accelerate in a bus 
with reduction gear boxes. Also, as I said before, you should never go 
near TMFH again. He is obviously stupid and unworthy of holding a tool 
in the presence of a VW bus. In fact, if he couldn't figure that one 
out, he's not even a mechanic, he's just from hell.

All you need to keep that bus running is the Idiot Book, the Bently, 
this list, and the tools you are going to be collecting over the next 
few years.
