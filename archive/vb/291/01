Subject: Re: [VB]gas heaters, but not J tubes

I drove a 66 w/ eberspacher down to California in the winter years ago.  For some reason the stock heater was not hooked up.  It turned out to have lower gas milage than I liked.   so I got out (in oregon somewhere) and hooked the stock heat up, and the bus was warmer even barely using the gas heater, and the milage got better.   There was snow on the ground I think.

I was told that you shouldn't notice the milage different much at all with using a heater, and that meant there was something wrong with the one in that bus, which may well be true.  

But that's my story and the next heater may not be perfectly tuned either, and it just makes sense to keep the stock heater set up.  I don't see any advantage to getting rid of it.
