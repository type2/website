Laura,

Thank you for letting VWOA know how we feel regarding their lack of
business ethics and foresight. Those of us who've been dealing with this
issue for a while (I've owned my 67 bus for 30 years now) have strong
feelings about it, and I for one, got a good chuckle reading all of the
attached correspondence that you sent with your letter to our list. It's
about time they got a little of what they've been dishing out.

Thaks again and keep in touch with the vintage community!
