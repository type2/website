Subject: yup more talk of heat (defroster)

so since it's the yearly heat talk I though I would ask this. I have
the stock heat in pretty darn good shape. There is a decent amount of
air flow that comes out the front bottom vents and it's quite warm.
What does puzzle me is the defrosters seem almost completely useless.
Then I flip the lever on the heat riser tube I does allow some air
into the defroster diffusers, but it's really more like a flea fart of
air. Is this typical or do I need to invest some more time into
looking. I tried fishing down the ducts to see if anything was
blocking the airflow, but no luck.
