You know, that sounds exactly like when I blew the throttle bore plug
out of a 31 PICT carb. As long as I had my foot in it would run(?) but
not idle. Kind of a slight vacuum leak. heh

Well, Eric&Barb, I'm in No. Cal.  The problem cropped up after I drove
it to work a couple of times -- 25 miles away and one hill that's about
10 miles long!  The final straw came on a cool morning.  Lost power and
I coasted to a stop at a restaurant (hmmm... maybe I shoulda had
breakfast!). Any way, I could get it started, but it wouldn't continue
to run without my foot on the pedal and it would die if I even thought
of putting it in gear.
