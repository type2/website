Subject: WANTED single cab gate latches 

Hi Folks, well happily I finally scored a set of gates
for my 1966 single.  I have the gate latches for the
rear tailgate but I am missing the latches for the
side gates...these are the ones that attach to the cab
it self just below the rear window.

If anybody has a pair of these please let me know what
you want for them and shipping to 43607

Thanks
Todd
