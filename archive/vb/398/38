Subject: Re: [VB] Intake Manifold Gaskets

Tom asked:


 I'm replacing the intake manifold on a 1500 (the old one had a large hole in the heat riser). The old
manifold did not have gaskets where it seats on the heads. It should have, but in my repair manual it shows
one kind of gasket (sorta like a muffler gasket) and in the Parts List I have it shows a metal ring type
gasket. Which is right?
 Where can I get just those gaskets? (I think I have everything else.)
