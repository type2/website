Subject: e-z bed hinges

I don't know how an e-z camper bed works .. but ..

http://www.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=419504

would the hinges on this bed work to convert the rear seat in my 60 into a
fold down bed ....

BTW .. I know not to post ebay listings to sell stuff .. but I'm not trying to
sell anything .. I'm asking for info prior to bidding .. surely that isnt' a
breech of the rule against ebay postings?
