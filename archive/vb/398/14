Luckily,

You can replace the apron and lid fairly easily/cheaply - those are  
the parts usually people have a hard time selling, so prices are low.  
In my accident similar to yours, the bondo artist just straightened  
out the section under the rear door so that the engine lid hinges  
worked properly. Lenses are also cheap and difficult to sell.

With the corners, mine were bondo'd up and I drove it that way for 5  
or so years before I took my bus off the road. I plan to straighten  
the section out with a stud welder and dolly/hammer rather than  
cutting it out. Your damage looks much less than mine was (is).
