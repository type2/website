Thanks for all the replies. If Bentley says graphite, then graphite it will 
be. Happen to have some on my shelf.

Tristan, thanks for the pics on the compression tool. I can figure out

I plan to replace only the outer bushing for now and see how that works.

ones back.)

Now to get some new bushings.
