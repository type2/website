 <http://www.thesamba.com/vw/shows/index.php#3636> June 03, 2007 - ABC Show
N Shine 
Scottsdale, Arizona 
ABC Show N Shine 
Sunday June 3rd 2007 
North Scottsdale VW 
7000 East Chauncey, just south of the 101 off Scottsdale Road 
If nothing else a great excuse to bring out the old bus and slow some rich
folks down as the ABC is given some prime real estate to setup a booth and
munch on free BBQ. 9:30am till whenever. If you get bored with the show take
a $50,000 Toureg out for a spin in the McDowells.
