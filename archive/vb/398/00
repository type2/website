Subject: mashed so-44, opened up

Now that I've pretty much given up on getting any insurance to cover this,
I've got ahead with starting to see what it's going to take to fix it.
The quick version:  vehicle owner's insurance was canceled feb 21st.
driver didn't present any.   So far no one can get ahold of driver or
owner to see if there's any other insurance to cover it.

Which leaves court.


Got the engine compartment open.   Fan belt was trash, as
expected...pulley DID take a hit while running.

More pictures.
