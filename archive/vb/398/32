Subject: Identification of a main oil seal...

Hi all,

While going through some spare parts I notice that I have a huge forward main
oil seal.  Here are the dimensions:

Outer diameter:   105mm
Inner diameter roughly:   82mm
thickness:   12mm

It is made by "Goetze" and the following markings are on it:

827  S   L   D   W
82 - 105 x 12x  Si

Okay detectives, anyone got a clue what this one fits onto? I thought maybe a
"bastard" 40hp  case, but the parts book says 100mm o.d. for those.  Maybe
Type 4 block, hell I don't know...educate me!

Bill
