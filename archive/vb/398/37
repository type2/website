Subject: Intake Manifold Gaskets

I'm replacing the intake manifold on a 1500 (the old one had a large 
hole in the heat riser). The old manifold did not have gaskets where 
it seats on the heads. It should have, but in my repair manual it 
shows one kind of gasket (sorta like a muffler gasket) and in the 
Parts List I have it shows a metal ring type gasket. Which is right? 
Where can I get just those gaskets? (I think I have everything else.)

Thanks in advance!
