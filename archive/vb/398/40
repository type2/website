Hi type2tom,
Bet there is a metal sealing ring in there!!  It is just  smashed in so much 
it now looks like part of the head.  Take a look at the  bore in the head, 
should be a "L" shape and not a shape that looks like a  negative of the beveled 
intake manifold end.  This O'ring  shaped seal is of steel with copper plating.
  Check out the "Parts Manuals" on the vintagebus.com website.   With the 
part number you should be able to order the metal sealing ring or you  can order 
the full engine rebuild gasket/seal kit and have spare seals/gaskets  on hand 
for later.
