Subject: Wiper motor

Hi,

I have a 1966 spilt screen camper which is almost finished being restored
ready for the MOT test (in UK), however the wiper motor has been removed and
tested but won't work!

The bus was changed to 12volt about 20 years ago but the motor is still
6volt.

Have looked for a replacement but no luck! Can anyone help with a
replacement/alternative/similar motor, even US source that can post to UK?

Hopefully the last thing needed to get it back on the road!



Many Thanks Guys
