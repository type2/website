OK everyone.  It's time again the Twin Cities (MN) Volkswagen Club
Annual Show!  This is the 20th one this year and there have been some
changes in the Type II classes.  This is the break down:

1951 to 1967
1968 to 1979
1980 to  1991

I got them to do it this way so Vanagons weren't competing with Splits.

So, with all these Type II classes, bring yours in!  There are 1st
through 3rd place trophies for all classes.

The date is Sunday 3 June from 9:00 am to 2:00 pm and it is a Westside
Volkswagen's new New Car dealership (Their old New Car dealership
sells Suzukis now.) on the west side of County Road 100, south of
I-394, in Saint Louis  Park on Westside Drive.

Hope to see you there!

P.S.
Could someone forward this to the Vintage Bus list,  please?
