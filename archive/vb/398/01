Subject: '66 rear end parts wanted!

Attention all you hoarders!  I want your parts! :-)

Starting the hunt for parts for my now mashed 1966 so-44.

Prefer excellent condition parts off a non-deluxe beige grey over titian
red bus...but everything else can be considered too. ;)

Looking for:

hatch
engine decklid
engine apron
reverse light
decklid hinge support section
passenger side apron mounting ear
possibly drivers side apron mounting ear
possibly passenger side corner
possibly a foot or so of wayback floor

locking engine lid latch (OE, no aftermarket)
hatch latch (OE, no aftermarket)


Willing to pay what it takes to get good parts, but please be
gentle....I'm having to fix this out of pocket because the (-at-)#$!!!(-at-)$#
driver has no insurance

(crossposted for a reason..;)
