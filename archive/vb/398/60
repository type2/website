Hi Busbaby,
Definitely see about going through your wiper motor, or having an electric  
motor shop take a look at it.  Having spare parts for any older automobile  is 
a must.  Having a few boxes of them really helps down the road.   Try 
thesamba.com for a search of the "Classifieds" there for "wiper  motor".  Found an NOS 
one there that is not too far from you.  Still  it would need repacking with 
new grease....
