HI,

Yes it could be used if it is set to the correct diameter and the case is 
properly set up on a machine that is large enough to handle it. Not small 
tasks.

 I'm not sure but I'm thinking maybe this could be used to align-bore cases? 
Somebody pls correct if I'm wrong. Seems very cheap at least with two days 
left on auction.
