Subject: Part Question #2

Alrighty lets try this again, sorry for the mess guys....

Stopped by an old friends house the other day to get some of my extra
parts out of his garage, and I found this (see attached) Can anyone
tell me what it is? At first I thought it was a compressor, but it has
a funny rubber boot on the bottom/end. i forgot I had it, when I
bought the bus 2 years ago the guy said it worked, but I cannot
remember for the life of me what it is....
