I have no idea about these, but they sure look nice!  Any idea of the
history of these?

 

------------------------------

I have been looking for a LOOOONNGG time in search of a matching pair.  I
cannot remember where I found these two.  I have one other but the logo is
an "X" not VW , so there is another variation. They just barely fit a bus
because they are not very deep.  "Bessie" my bus loves them, but as for now
there is just two on one side

Hopefully my quest one day will be fulfilled, Bless you all and thanks, uj
