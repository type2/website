Yep, this was a VERY short-lived thing called the Seat Belt Interlock Relay
system prevalent on 74 Beetles, Ghias & 412s.  Never appeared on the Type 2
that year for some reason and has never reappeared on any VW model since.
It was used only one year because the USDOT required it in that model year
for all cars in the USA, not just VW.  The DOT regulation was quickly
rescinded because of thousands of problems reported by very irate drivers
who couldn't start the vehicle even when correctly buckled up.  An idea that
technology couldn't quite handle at the time.  In later Bentley Book wiring
diagrams for the Type 1, they have a supplement page on how to defeat the
system by placing certain jumpers at the Interlock Relay connection block.
Funny, as technology caught up, the USDOT never re-implemented the
regulation.
