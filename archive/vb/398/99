Subject: Volkswagen North Scottsdale

Many thanks to Volkswagen North Scottsdale for a VWonderful Show and Shine
and eats. Free food? We will be there. A special thanks to Robert Lyon of
the dealership for taking care of us. Some 35 happy VW people went home
stuffed with food and raffle prizes. William won the uncle jerry jess award
in his phantom 1971 square back. Plans are in the works for doing it again,
hopefully soon. If you missed it, you missed a lot of laid back fun, and it
was all in the cool shade. David even brought his portable swamp cooler. All
proceeds from the raffle went to a Charity designated by the ABC,  Arizona
Bus Club
