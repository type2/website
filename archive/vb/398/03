Hi Greg,
58 and 63 wiring harnesses are way different. See the wiring diagrams  on 
vintagebus.com web site, and compare.
  We would first look into repairing the wiring harnesses.  Most  of the time 
these just require a bit of solder and heat shrink to get a solid  connection 
to repair wires you install on either end of the original  harness.  
Plundering wrecking yards for wiring harnesses for not only  pre-1980s VWs, but most 
any Euro made automobiles of that era will result  in lots of spare wiring of 
the correct size and even colors.
