Subject: tranny info

I'm about to get the tranny in my 60 converted into a fwy flier .. I'm keeping
my OE redux boxes .. as I have a spare set and a spare set of drums ...
anyway, I'm hoping someone who knows can tell me what I need to do to the 60
tranny.

I plan on running a 1600 or maybe 1641 - with OE redux boxes and gearing .. I
want to cruise at 62.5 mph .. and take hills OK ... so I'm asking what I need
to ask the tranny guy to do ...
