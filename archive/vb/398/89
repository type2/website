 Today I replaced the seals around my headlamp glass. In  the process I noticed that someone, not me, had
nipped off the tabs that align the ring that fits behind the sealed beams. More investigation found that the
my new OEM chrome trim rings were swapped with the innards. So, after swapping and fitting the right hand lamp
correctly, I found that the left hand lamp ended up with the sealed beam turned 90 degrees!

More investigation found that the part numbers on the innards are 211 941 038 on the right hand side and 111
941 037 on the left side.

Do I have a bug innards on the left?
If so, I need (want) a bus innards.

Yep, you have the bug guts.

The infamous "Bug headlights work fine on a bus if you butcher them....".

I may have some pieces left of bus headlights.
