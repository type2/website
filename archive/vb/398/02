Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Good Wiring Harness?

I've seen the harnesses by the Wiring Works guy in San Pedro. I'm in So. 
Cal. He shows up at a lot of the VW events. The harnesses look good. Not 
sure about the correct colors and stripes, but I believe they are correct. I 
believe the new harness installed in my bus by the restoration shop used a 
harness from Wiring Works.

Look in the archives, I think you will see some stuff on wiring harnesses.
