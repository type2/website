Subject: Re: [VB] '61 Panel Emergency Fuel Shutoff

Since you have a 61 with the cable et al, you just need to have a working 
reserve tap.   I think you can buy them from WW, they do have rebuild kits if you 
have a non working one.  If your cable is stuck, they have new cables.  If 
your cable isn't stuck, pull the cable out of the sheath, and reinstall it with 
grease so it stays unstuck.   I don't know if the new taps come with the arm 
you need, or not.   Do you need pics?  I could try and take pics of what's in 
my 61, but it may be awkward as the motor all all is in place.  Maybe they have 
pics in the Bentley.  It is easier to install the tap with motor out, the 
threads on the nut thing are dual, so you have threads for the spout on the 
bottom of the tank and for those on the tap. and it's awkward to deal with it with 
motor in.  

a reserve tap makes life easier for engine pulling... shut off fuel and it'll 
just drip a little, not pour out. plus you get the one gallon warning of the 
empty tank.  Install a new fuel sock.

Awhile back there was talk about the danger of fire to busses and an emergency
shutoff valve. Since I will be pulling my engine to do some work I thought it
would be a good time to rig a shutoff valve. I have the reserve wire but it
isn't hooked up. I have a late model gas tank installed. I would like to
connect the fuel shutoff to the reserve wire so I can operate it from the cab.
Any and all info would be appreciated.
