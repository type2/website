Subject: Jerome ...who's a-coming?

Well,

Only a few weeks out....the subject says it all.  Plus the list has been quiet
today.

I've missed the past two years due to work and what not...but I'll be leaving
So-Cal either Weds. or Thurs.  Possibly solo...possibly with familia.

Ready to head back after leaving Jerome on Monday....

Beto
60Std.
Murrieta, CA....lookin for a 3/4 or full roof rack and Bice bumpers any leads
appreciated!
