Sam,
Thanks for the pics.
Looking at the pics 12 lb. oil pressure, 180 degs, at 4200 rpm looks LOW!
As for the oil light "the new vdo duel sender" not as you have used 
turns the oil light on about 2 lb. above the stock one.
Your 800 rpm idle and oil pressure of 8 lb. at 175 degs?? also looks low.
Others will quote specks but yours look low.
Did you reseal all the roof panel flappers while it was open?
P & C
We did get a 6 conductor through the post. for later things.
