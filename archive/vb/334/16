Subject: Bosche voltage regulator

Twice in the last two years I have had to replace new Brazillian made
VR's on my truck and my trike. I used a couple of 30 year old German
built Bosche VR's after popping the top and checking the contacts. Has
anyone else had problems with pitting and oxidizing contacts on the
Brazillian made VR's?
