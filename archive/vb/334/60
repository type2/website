I have put up the pictures of the installation.
Yes, you have to take out all the roof panels to get things  installed.
No, I really did not know that I was cruising at 4500  rpm.
The engine still runs fine but the oil light is on (-at-) 400 rpm  idle.
 
I do need to run the wires up the drivers side front window  column but a 
four wire set is too thick so have a temporary patch in for  now.
