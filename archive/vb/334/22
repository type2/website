Adrian, that's a torque motor to put in the van. I assume that you still
have redux and original tranny. With that gear ratio and stroke on the
engine I'd be running an Engle 100 or a stage 1 cam in order to keep
your bottom end. Unless you jet your 30 PICt-1 with a main like a fire
hose and up the air to at least 65 I wouldn't use that combo. You
mentioned a 34 PICT-3 so I can again assume that this is DP, not an SP
motor? A 34 PICT would be running 132.5/137/140/65 jets to keep up with
the stroke you have. I run 132.5 on the 1835 and 137 on the 1904 when
using a 34 PICT. I like the junk yard Holley 5200 progressive I got from
a 71 Pinto. It has a 28mm primary, great for bottom end, and a 36mm
secondary for that occasional passing on the highway. It fits the Weber
32/36 progressive center section. Personally I like the 1.25 rockers
because it allows correct breathing at the low end without flooding the
cylinders and keeps up with the demand as you run up the rpm's.

I am pretty stuck here...

What is a good cam for a 2007 (90.5x78.4) that will go in a heavy '66
Westi?

Carb will most likely be a 30P1 or 34P3 to start with... Or maybe just
suck
it up and get dual Dell DRLA 40s.  Later it will run CIS fuel injection,
but
that might be a while off...  I almost fear putting on the DRLAs as I
will
never want to complete the FI swap!  LOL
Thanks,
