Subject: WTB:  Dellorto 40 DRLAs

Since we are talking parts in the "Indecent Proposal" thread I thought I 
would kick it off a little bit here :)

Needed:   one pair of Dellorto 40 DRLAs.  Preferably jetted for a 2.0ish 
motor.

I do not need manifolds/linkage/etc.  as I have Berg manifolds and linkage 
waiting to rock and roll...  Expensive but worth it!  As are most Berg items 
actually.

I am willing to pay $175 to $275 depending on condition.  $275 being ready 
to bolt on and run properly jetted and with beautiful velocity stacks like 
this:

Something that I have to buy jets for and rebuild because it has been 
sitting in a mudpuddle for 15 years will be at the $175 level because of all 
the work involved.  Pretty obvious I think.

Thank You,
Adrian Pillow
