Hi Matthew,
Fresh air or stale?!?!  If fresh air go with a doghouse shroud.  #3 cylinder 
will run much cooler and the rest of the engine also.  Nobody will see the 
doghouse and will only be able to tell if they reach around the shroud.  Just 
make sure to get all the shroud tin and a 33, 34, or best yet a 35mm (inside 
measurement) wide cooling fan.
