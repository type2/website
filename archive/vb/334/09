Subject: Re: [VB] Vacumn leak

on 3 and 4 there is little or no change in rpm when you remove the spark?
This means that when the spark is present these are not powering the engine.
So look for the cause of no power being produced from these cyls. How about
compression? Try a compression test.
The sound you hear when the engine is running may be coming from a leaking
valve. How about a burned valve or dropped valve seat? Just my 2 cents.
