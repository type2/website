Looking at the pics 12 lb. oil pressure, 180 degs, at 4200 rpm looks LOW!
Hi Sam,
That sounds low to us also!  According to "Without Guesswork" the wear limit 
for oil pressure is 28 PSI (-at-) 2,500 RPM (-at-)158 F oil temp, with the new limit 
being 42 PSI.  Sounds like time to rebuild your engine if the oil pressure gauge 
is reading correctly.  With our buses we hold well over 30 PSI (-at-) 3,000 RPM up 
to 210F, and over 10 PSI at idle.  
  After a week or two you will not need the tach because you will have gotten 
used to what RPM you are doing in which gear at what MPH.  
  We have not liked this mounting of gauges in the fresh air vent because of 
all the water that gets up in there.  Plus the viewing is harder due to both 
angle and darkness when bright sunny outside.  Still it is good to have the 
gauges and the passengers can easily monitor them to help keep an eye on what the 
engine is doing.
