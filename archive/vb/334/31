Subject: Greetings from ATHENS!

Just a hello to the list from Athens and the Olympics.  I've been here a week and am working shooting for my show (Access Hollywood - NBC).  We are here till Sept. and I'm not sure I'll make it.  Week one started out with a 42hr stretch and then each succeeding day until yesterday was +20hrs min. These people start eating dinner at 12mid and then go out and party starting at 2am till dawn.  Being entertainment we have to cover the parties.  On the up side, we went to Mikonos for two days and well, lets just say european beaches + TV camera= :-0!!!!!!!!!!  Ah, if I could only show you the tape..... 

Anyway, I'm upholding the VW flag and bugging the hell out of my fellow workers pointing out any and all old air cooled vws.  So far I've only spotted 5-6 bay panels still in service and a few 60's beetles.  Its VERY  dry here, so I'll bet there are a few splits stashed out in the country side.  In the city where people drive like maniacs, a stock powered split would not last long :-(   Did I mention the drivers are INSANE!??  Nice people though :-)

Not much free time, but I'm keeping my eyes peeled.  Anybody planning on coming or is here already??  Pmail me so we can possibly hook up.   Andio for now!
