Subject: Re: [VB] Indecent Proposal

I'm not disagreeing with you .. ok maybe I am .. but it would assist me
because I just never seem to have time to cruise the ebay site.  I've seen
people get great things that I didn't know about because the surf ebay and I
don't ... if I had a heads about about ebay stuff ... it would help me.  I
too hate to encourage profiteers ... I am a lefty pinko Canuck after all.
