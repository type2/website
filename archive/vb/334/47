Hello Jammy

If you are heading to Germany and love VW you must and I said MUST go to
Wolfsburg, were everything began about 50 years ago.
If you are on train is very easy, onece you get there the Autostadt a kind
of thematic park about automotive industries is rigth across the river just
beside the VW factory (do you know the 3 chimnies and the VW sing in the big
building that we the fans are almost tired to see in advertisment pictures)
well you will be rigth there.
The Autosstadt is a sort of park where VW company has pavillions of every
one of the VW owned brands (Bentley, Skoda, Lamborgini, Seat and of course
VW), beside the pavillios and the park it self there are a museun of the
automovile history with a lot of restored and I mean pefect, you will see
the first VW protoptype and the one million gold painted with jewlls in the
bumpers among many others, also you will find souvenirs, colectables and
much more that I could buy and of course few diferent but excelentes
restuarants all in one place the entrance cost me about $14 when I was there
at April 2002, check the site anyway.

Just a few minutes walking away is the VW museum the one all we herad about
very nice selection of cars (not well restored some of them but worth the
visit every penny) and of course more souvenirs to buy.

There is a Ritz Carlton Hotel in the area but if you are on budget like I
was there is a nice hotel across street of the train station

Tryp Hotel Wolfsburg in Wolfsburg

Look for the site in the web but as far I can remenber the rates are around
$90 that is not bad in Europe

I hope yhis help

Greetings
