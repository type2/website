Subject: Re: [VB] Indecent Proposal

Hello Guys    I think I'll agree with John Baker on this subject. I would 
much rather help the other busers out there than use E Barf   What happens on E 
barf is people buying stuff to resell at a higher price   What this does is 
drive the prices up and really doesn't help the other bussers. Also there are all 
the rip off guys on E barf  Just about everybody that has gotten stuff from E 
barf has been ripped.  It has also hurt the swap meets at the shows I just 
got back from the Ohio Vintage Show and it was the worse selling show I have 
ever done it was a good thing that the real reason I went to Ohio was to camp 
with the OVT guys  but thought what the hay cover the costs  barely did  .  Can't 
help but think that E barf and the Samba are hurting the swaps.  I just sold 
a brake regulator to a guy off the list that was looking for a rebuild kit for 
one  gave him a hell of a deal $50.00 for a NOS one .I just sent a cam & 
lifters to a Moonie in South Carolina for free for just being a fullmooner  
Something tells me that  the good Karma will be returned in triple  . I would just 
as soon read about trip reports and solutions to problems  than see what 
somebody is trying to sell.   just my thoughts    later and have fun  Mark Dearing

of VW parts for sell but email me off the list please  .
