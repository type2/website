Subject: Safari Wiper shaft parts

Two questions.

1.  Anyone have a NOS or near NOS early safari wiper
shaft unit (the under dash mount type) that they can
measure a few dims for me?  I am looking for the
diameters (Both large and small) of the main shaft.  I
plan to make a few replacments for my units and want
to make sure of the OD's.

2.  Anyone in need of new shafts?  While i am at it i
can make some more since they are not that
complicated.  Email me off list if you are interested.
 they will probably be 303 stainless and not cost too
much.

Matt
