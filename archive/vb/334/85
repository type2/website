Subject: Re: [VB] Indecent Proposal

I have to agree with Mark Dearing and John Baker on this one.

E-bay is nice for what it is, but is not a "kind" place to shop.  Too many 
sharks and not real VW people...  And no you do not need to be a hippie or 
something to be a VW person, it is about friendship and a common philosophy 
on life. The simple things if you will.

Post friendly items to help others and give good deals here to keep another 
bus on the road.

FWIW I know for a fact Mark and John are great people and are not BSing when 
they say they give parts and help to fellow bussers in need.  Kudos to you 
guys for keeping it real!  I like to believe I help fellow bussers when I 
can as well, but it is easier to reach out and pat someone else on the back 
than coil to scratch mine :)

Granted the list needs to pick up the pace a little bit!

Take Care,
