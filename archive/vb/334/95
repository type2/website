what i was trying to say was that ebay seems labor intensive, overpriced,
and boring. but for me, nothing beats digging in greasy boxes all day and
coming up with the piece you need, often at a much better price. so they are
very different to me. the only thing better than swaps are field finds, yard
sales etc.


"There is a lot of stuff on ebay and searching can be a little time
consuming but if you want something bad enough that is what you have to do.
It's no different than going through greasy piles of parts at a swap weet"
