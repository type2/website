Aren't they called Bryce bumpers?


Ellis extends a solid > Doubtful.

Between selling off things, massive "mandatory" OT at work, having to deal with
my wifes' "gotta have them" three dogs (from hell), active family and now we
are in a 24-7 haul anus mode to bang our house into for sale condition.

Basically, I have hugely soured on Jerome to be specific and what I call
"Arizona Camping" in general. Definition of that term is dry dirt/dust, too
much sun and total abesence of shade/trees and security-responsibility
personnel. Add too much alcohol and perhaps stronger elements.  Oh VanBondo!
Where did your youth go? Oh yeah, it is clinging to my legs and demanding milk
cups and food. Now I remember. =)

Lake Havasu has become our requisite annual "camping" outing. Mostly based on
grass parking area and the time of year that is not so blazing hot.

I pray for the time at which the kids have more wheels under them and I am
<hopefully> not so overwhelmed with chores/house/job duties.

If we show up to Jerome it will probably be somewhat of a miracle or a
demand-insistence from the wife.
