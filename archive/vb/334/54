Subject: Instrument panel nearly there

I bought an instrument panel with gauges from Hot Dog Fred at  Red Barn or 
BYOB thus year and have finally gotten down to installing  it.
Amazingly everything seems to work with the exception of the  oil pressure 
gauge.
THanks Fred.
 
I will post some photos of the package that goes where the  fresh air vent 
is. 
Has anyone had any problems with instruments in that  location?
I will now find out what my real gearing is, I have been known  to creep up 
to 70 mph +. I have not fried my engine yet but suspect that it  has a non 
standard tranny and the 205X15 wheels and tyres should  help.
 
It probably is a terrible idea to have:
voltmeter
oil temp
oil pressure
Tachometer (RPM's)
 
Because then I will worry about not having a CHT and will be  paranoid about 
the readings anyway.
