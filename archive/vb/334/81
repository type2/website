I've always liked that location for instruments of one type or another,
it's just that it's a high moisture area in my truck and so you would
have to use stainless steel mounting hardware and moisture protect all
connections. I already have replaced what was left of the original
screws that hold the panel face on with SS screws and a new neopreme
gasket.

I have put up the pictures of the installation.
Yes, you have to take out all the roof panels to get things  installed.
No, I really did not know that I was cruising at 4500  rpm. The engine
still runs fine but the oil light is on (-at-) 400 rpm  idle.

I do need to run the wires up the drivers side front window  column but
a
four wire set is too thick so have a temporary patch in for  now.
