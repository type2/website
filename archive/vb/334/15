Look in the VW interchange book, it gives you all of the rpm/degree
infor on the various mechanical advance distributors and if there is a
#3 retard or not. Personally, I loved the 050 with dual points for
driving around town and to work in my bug. Power to weight with the
1600/1641/1676 and a modified 34 PICT-3 was great and gas mileage was
around 24 average on the highway. With my truck I have a different power
to weight issue which includes the reduction gears. I find that a
correctly built German 009 or a modified Brazillian 009 works best with
a modified 34 PICT-3. The 010 comes in too soon for me at too low of an
RPM and thus prevents good top end performance for those times I find
myself on the highway.

If I had my pick, I would stock only SVDA distributors for all my motors
and be done with it, but then, I'm not a rich man!

I tried a German 009 in the split a few years ago and hated it compared
with
the 019.  The 009 never seemed to get on "curve" until the revs were way

up...  Which is true since it is all in at 3500RPM.

... In actuality the 019 should be all in at 3500, but I think it is
only
running one spring and goes all in at 2500.  :)

The 019 has 17 degrees total advance compared with the 010 with 20
degrees.
Not sure about the 009?
