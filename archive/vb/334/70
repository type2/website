Subject: Indecent Proposal

Subject catch your eye? ;)

Anyway - Ok - so this list has slowed down a lot over the past year or so ...
some folks say that people be likin' the samba forums - i dunno?

Anyway - so ... I think the list policy was no postin' about your ebay ads - I
think that policy made tons o' sense when list traffic was high ... but not
that list traffic is slow does that policy still make sense ... what if folks
be listin' stuff that is specifically related to our early buses ... I know
that many people have lots of time to cruise the ebay listings and get great
stuff ... other folks don't have time to cruise ebay - might be a good service
to let folks know what's available.

If the big competition for the list is samba .. maybe allowing people to
advertise their ebay listing would ... in a way ... compete with samba.
