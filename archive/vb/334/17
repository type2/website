Subject: Flap year/type?

Volk-a-maniacs,

So, while at the PIR show this weekend, I picked up a flap with good glass,
handle and lock and mostly good metal for $5.  Thinking originally that I
would be swapping the glass I just bought for the broken version (size is
roughly 32"x14") on my '63 bus, I took the flap over to my bus as a
comparison.  The glass on the $5 flap is much smaller (size is roughly
26"x11").  The $5 flap is maybe from another year or style?  Since the $5 flap
is a screw on replacement for mine, but with smaller and unbroken glass, I
just swapped them this afternoon.  Cool.

Now my questions.
- A characteristic is that the $5 flap has a 'divot' in the metal above the
handle.  Similar to the flap pictured at this link:
http://www.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=89045
The odd thing is that this picture shows a larger window space, but has the
'divot'.  Does this help identify the year/model that this $5 flap belongs to?
- Why does the $5 flap have a smaller window?
- Is this a deluxe vs. standard thing?
- Is this a year difference thing?

Should I be embarrassed to have this thing on my '63 Panel/camper conversion?
(Not that I really care if my parts match... I like functional most of all.)
:o)

Thanks in advance for your help.
