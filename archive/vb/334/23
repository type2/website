Trying to get my bus running by the end of the summer.
 Engine is almost done.  Baby coming and the time i
can devote to the Double Cab is quickly coming to an
end.  Anyone have one of these for sale?  It is the
last major part i need before i stick it in and turn
it over.   (Mine has one of the heat riser with a hole
blown thru)

(Ronnie,  if you still have one, i am still interested
in it.)

Also, if the price is right i am looking for:

decent bus 40 HP fan shroud.
Neiman Steering Lock unit.  Electrical & key missing
is OK
Drivers side rear bumper splash plate.

Thanks for the help.

Matthew
