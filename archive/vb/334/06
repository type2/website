The test for pulling off wires, just tests if the cylinders are firing.
Could be a few things.

THe wires coud not have a good connection to either the cap or the plugs.

The plugs could be fouled, but they would be fouled for a reason.

The head may need to be retorqued, or the stud may be stripped.  If this is
the case, you will not be able to get any torque on the head.
