Subject: '60 singlecab for sale

Hi, my name is Mike and I'm a bus addict. Like many of you, I need to sell 
one bus to rescue another one from destruction at the hands of neglegent 
owners or the forces of mother nature.  I have a rather rusty singlecab that 
I need to sell so I can afford my addiction. This truck has had a hard life, 
and needs a good home for its retirement. I rescued it from sure destruction 
in november of last year from a farm where it was buried in mud. The phrase 
"rust free" on this truck means that there is no additional charge for the 
rust. There is a fair ammount of rust, but nothing that a skilled bodyman 
could fix. I was going to leave it as is and slam it for the rat look, but 
what you do with it is up to you. This bus runs and drives, although I 
wouldn't trust it farther than I can push it. The motor is a rebuilt 
longblock with good used electronics / carb / exaust...typical "rebuilt" 
motor. The trans is a working big nut RGB unit but its condition is unknown. 
The truck has been converted to 12 volt and everything works. I have since 
replaced the ugly trucker tail lights with 62-71 oval style turnsignal / 
brake light housings and lenses. The rockers / dog legs / jack points are 
shot and in need of replacing. The frame cross members are gone and need to 
be replaced. The treasure chest cargo floor is rusty, and you can see 
daylight through the bottom. The front floors have been patched and covered 
in POR-15, as have the front wheel wells. I just recently replaced 100% of 
the brake system ($$$) so the truck stops as well as a single circut drum 
brake vehicle is capable of. The dash of the truck is uncut and unmolested, 
and even houses an original sapphire am radio which is functional. The truck 
was equipped with a dealership installed windshield washer squirter bottle, 
but sadly the rubber cap is cracked (go figure) There is no major body 
damage, just a few dents and dings here and there. All the rubber seals are 
shot, as are the front windshields. The truck has a mismatched set of beetle 
rims on it, but I also have a matched set of 4 dated 15" crows feet rims for 
extra $$$ (dont really want to sell them) I will deliver within 200 miles of 
denver, Co for $150. Other than that, its up to you to figure out shipping. 
I will work with the buyer to help and arrange shipping as best as I can.

You can view all the pictures I have online of the truck at

I am open to interesting vw related trades.

Addendum:
No, the truck probably can not be driven cross country due to the fact that:
#1 it is a 40 yr old vw...
#2 the gearbox is functioning but I cannot guarentee that it wont sieze.
#3 You'd get hassled by "the man" just because the truck is ugly

Yes, it does run
Yes, it is really rusty
This truck is sold "As is" and there is no express or implied warranty on 
any parts or labor previously mentioned. If you want to drive it home, you 
acknowledge that I am not responsable for any reprocussions or problems that 
may occur. Please understand this is only to protect myself from stupid 
people doing stupid things.

Please email vw_dienst(-at-)yahoo.com or call 970-412-5270 for more info.
