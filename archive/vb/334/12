Hi Diana,
If you fix all the leaks into the bus, a plywood floor with linoleum will not 
hold in water unless you have a habit of pouring water on it.  If you really 
want max rust protection of the floor then do rust removal and repainting 
followed a few days later by applying a very thin coat of roofing tar.
