Gosh I love it <sarcasm> when I replied to "all" but did not check to see if
"all" included the list.

Let me clarify that I strongly support the charitible cause, the effort put
into the planning and preparation and actual production of the event, the
promoting club(s) and people involved in the annual Jerome Jamboree. Do not let
MY current personal position/cirumstances in life (small kids, a wedding
anniversary that coincides with that weekend each year and a ton of
professional and personal projects underway) deter YOU and yours from
participating and enjoying this or any other VW related event.

My family and I have had at least ten years out of what? 14-15 years? worth of
fun by attending this event. My situation is that I have become terribly
overwhelmed with circumstances beyond VWs for the time being. In no way do I,
or did I, intend to speak badly about any of my friends in the Arizona Bus Club
or those other folks who join me in supporting them. I have met MANY great
people though the AzBusClub and aircooled VWs in general.

Remember that the annual Jerome Jamboree is a charity fund raiser in support of
great causes. The Arizona Bus Club, which I am still a dues paid member, has
raised a lot of dinero in support of charity, through your help, over the
years. My family and I have had and look forward to having many great times at
this event. For the time being we are simply slammed with activities and zapped
of energy.

Don't let my current view of camping deter you in any form or fashion! Plan to
attend, donate generously to the cause and have great FUN! =) If we can be
there we will.
