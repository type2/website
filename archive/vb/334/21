Subject: Columbus Ohio Volksfest Show - INFO???

Hey Y'all,
I was checking out the COVVC website to get vending
information for the Volksfest Show that is supposed to
be next weekend and I see that their site is not
updated for 2004...Anyone know if they have a new web
site somewhere??  This has been a HUGE show for the
past few years, and I am going to be very surprised if
the updated 2004 info isn't yet posted...
