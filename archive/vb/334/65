Subject: '61 Panel Emergency Fuel Shutoff

Awhile back there was talk about the danger of fire to busses and an emergency
shutoff valve. Since I will be pulling my engine to do some work I thought it
would be a good time to rig a shutoff valve. I have the reserve wire but it
isn't hooked up. I have a late model gas tank installed. I would like to
connect the fuel shutoff to the reserve wire so I can operate it from the cab.
Any and all info would be appreciated.
