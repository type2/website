Subject: planning a honeymoon, Want to see VW's in natural habitat

The official VW museum in Wolfsburg, of course. They have a website:

http://automuseum.volkswagen.de/

Click on the british flag to see the english version of the page. They have
a link to request a catalog for souvenirs, but when I filled out the request
form, they just emailed me an excel spreadsheet.

natural habitat?
