On my recent trip to Idaho I was asked about the guages in my 61.. why bother 
with oil temp and pressure?  Do I really use the tach?   
At the time I said, well, really it just gives me something to look at on 
road trips.  Entertainment value.  But then I thought about it... and what it 
does is tell me is when to back off to prevent overheating.  Rather than guessing 
if it's "hot", there's a guage to tell me how much so.     Doesn't make me 
paranoid.

is a good start on gear ratio, and the jack up the bus and count motor
