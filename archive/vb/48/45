Its fine to talk about the availabilty of a canvas, maybe it can help someone out, but why does there have to be a middle man?  Why cant someone just order one directly and not use their estranged uncle to get it?  Why always try to be in the middle of everything and get your name out there?  Provide contact info and ride off into the sunset, no need to carry it further than that.
