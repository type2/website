> FWIW I looked at Sunbrella fabric when deciding on what to have my tilt made
out of.  If you want a stronger, longer lasting fabric with a variety of
colors, finishes, etc. its  probably the best fabric out there.  Its also
more expensive than the "#8 duck canvas" which the og tilts appear to be
made of, and does not look at all like the og tilts.  I chose to go with the
original #8 canvas because I wanted the tilt and hardware to match the
original. BTW, I think every one would be amazed at how little it actually
costs to have one made with the oem hardware, same canvas, all details, etc.
compared to what prices are being bandied about, if you are not in business
to sell them to someone else, and know where to get the hardware, who can
sew it, etc.
