Dang! Clowns to the left of me, jokers to my right-here I am stuck here writing
to you...

OK, you got me! I am a son of a gun. Yes, sold a bus in pieces to Beto and took
two whole days working on Matt's bus. Made him wait in the heat too. This rat
bastard is offering to take that bus back just as it was sold in exchange for
that truck minus that sorry excuse of a cash deposit that you left. I'd be
stuck having to resell the bus. It's a gamble with odds to the house. But
that's the kind of guy that I am. Trying to help out friends and what do I get?
Gee whiz.
Hey, I guess that Beto and Matt are more familiar with going "Down South" than
I am... Probably listen to twangy Texas music too! My suggestion is that Matt
and Beto carpool to Phoenix and we all discuss the matter over a beer or
twelve.
Meet you this weekend at our club house near South Mountain. Be there or be
sober.
