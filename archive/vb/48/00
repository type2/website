Nice story Mike!

My brother and I took my 67 kombi to Baja 2 years ago.  One day when the
surf was small, we went driving.  I drove through the tiniest little dip
and got stuck.  I tried the e brake trick and it moved more, but no
luck.   We spent 45 minutes pushing back and forth by hand, pushing
branches under the tires.

Now, let me tell you how easy it was to find branches 200 miles south of
the border. . . .
