Jennifer,

In the nicest possible way, understanding that nobody wants to revive some
very ugly threads from days gone by, because that would not be constructive
at all:

If you are going to be recommending Dawn's work on the list, and referring
to her "line up" of customers, then we need to know whether the back orders
in that lineup have been filled. Because at one time there were quite a
number of people who had sent money in advance and had nothing to show for
it long, long after.

We understand there were some devastating personal problems, whatever they
were, and of course we don't want to embarrass the lady by reciting those,
but we do need to know that the back orders have been filled.

The vendors who have survived on these lists understand that they are
subject to constant, intense surveillance because of the nature of this
medium. (That which doesn't kill me makes me stronger--some of them
understand this medium so well that they can consistently turn a flame from
the odd dissatisfied customer into a PR opportunity, and come out looking
better than before. It's really quite a phenomenon and I admire them, like I
admire the 'nads on a brass monkey. 8^ )

We need to know whether Dawn's back orders have been filled before we can
have too much talk about her (celebrated, undeniable) skill as a seamstress.
