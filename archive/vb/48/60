Dawn doesnt NEED to TRY to sell anything to ANYONE~
Dawns work stands out with a shine and a shimmer of quality handcrafted
seamstress work, and the line up of customers that are waiting to fill thier
order after thier friends friends grandmas get thier work done, should show
for the backing of her work.
good-day
