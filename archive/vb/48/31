All the lines I've seen have been steel or aluminum.  who knows if they
are original or not!  I've seen some kludges done with copper tubing, but
they obviously were not original.

The problem with copper line is that, when flexed, it will work-harden
until it cracks.  Steel is much more resistent to fatigue problems like
this.

On the same topic, I've also found instance where people have used rubber
lines of excessive length.  Such lines, if not restrained, will tend to
flop and vibrate around and fail prematurely.  This probably caused more
leaks than metal line problems!
