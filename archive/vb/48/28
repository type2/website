Subject: Double Cab Canvas

  $500? The price sounds great but it makes me wonder if 
this source for canvas uses the correct grommets and 
other hardware? How's the quality?
  PLF was going for what? $800 - $900, the canvas seemed 
lightweight, and some have stated the seams aren't 
straight. I see the same prices for POS OG canvas that 
is in worse shape than my internet stocks.
