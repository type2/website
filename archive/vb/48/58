Oh no.

The annual summertime flamefest is starting up again and it's barely fall.
That means we have to do snow tires in the spring and gas heaters in the
summer. Oh the humanity. Let's review.

Nobody slammed Dawn. You don't need to either, because she isn't trying to
sell you a doublecab canvas and it would be a snoozefest anyway.
James didn't slam Jerry. Little bit of a tough read, but I didn't see a
slam. Mostly complimentary, I thought.
Kris did. No gray area with Kris.
Doublecabs suck, singlecabs rule. Canvas won't help. No matter how hard you
rub, you can't polish a turd. 8^)
Deluxes suck worse than doublecabs. Wouldn't be bad without all that sissy
jewelry on them, the corner windows were kind of a nice idea that never
really took off on the good buses.
Don't even get me started on people with hacked up freak buses......

Happy Turkey Day everyone, or Tofurkey Day for those so inclined.
