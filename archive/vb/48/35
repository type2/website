If you put the bus axles on a bug tranmission, you will find that you now
have 4 speeds in reverse!

To convert, you need to flip the ring gear around to the other side to
reverse the rotation of the axles.  I believe that this is an operation
that requires expertise in setting the gear backlash, and, I suspect, some
special tooling.
