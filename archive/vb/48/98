Increases with chassis speed, in number of cycles of sound (a plate like
clickty clack, very load, and seems from the very soul of the chassis, as
you can't define it as right or left wheel area, but rather center section
esqe.
Out of gear, any gear, in gear, clutch in out, engine on off, all the same.
Faster you go, louder and more often the clacky click uccurs. Seems like
when a rear is going on an old Checy, that's why I think it's the diff. Just
a damn shame since its all new! Engine seems to sluppy the speed to increase
the rate of sound, but not influence the sound directly any other way.

Does it increase in sync with the engine or with the transmission (ie road
speed), an irrespective of in-gear/out-of-gear?
