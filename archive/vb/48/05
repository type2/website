Grrrrr.

Admin contact for the site (and the presumed mastermind behind the spam) is
Mr. Jesus Rodriguez de Vera of Miami <ssd(-at-)mindspring.com>.

vwaddicts.com is downstream from indyserv.net, which has no functional web
page, and fictitious administrative contact information, and is listed in
several spam blacklists. Complain to <abuse(-at-)verio.com> quoting the entire
spam INCLUDING FULL HEADERS or they can't help.

If anybody else got this I'd be interested in knowing; in particular, if
this spammer harvested addresses from the lists I will make it my mission in
life to staple him to the wall.
