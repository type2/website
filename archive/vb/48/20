Hi,

On Sunday I got up early and put together some parts for the swap meet. 
I was thinking, I'll get their by 10 am when everybody else is getting 
there - hope I don't get there too early.

When we turned into the show area I saw an entire parking lot full of 
bugs, busses, things, type 3's...it was amazing. The sun came out just 
as we were pulling in and stayed out for several hours - it got cloudy 
around 1, but it was still really nice out. What a great time everyone 
had.

There was a minor disturbance when a kombi owner started unloading early 
type 2 parts - and I mean unloading. (The garage was full of parts and 
he needed the space.) Unfortunately, I along with several other bus 
owners just missed the feeding frenzy - we were all lamenting about not 
having back seats, and one having just gone for $20!

There was even a good water cooled crowd too. There was even an Isetta 
(restored and for sale for 9k). Variety was the spice of the day, plenty 
of mods and stocks to go around.

Conrad
