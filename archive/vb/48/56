Hi Jim...thanks mucho AWESOME page. I definitely have
book marked it for future references. 

Only prob is it seems to gloss over the very info I
really desired.  It lumps the 36hp mechanical dizzys
019, 010 and 009 together with no info detailed as to
total advance at what RPM.  Nor does it distinguish
what years models ect those seperate dizzys where for.
 Plus like most info VW has put out they complete
ignore the fact of the recalled bastard engine. 
Definitely looking for info on correct dizzy for that
as I have one. 

Anyone else have any more detailed info on those
dizzys?

Thanks!
tds
