 We restore all makes and models but we are predominatly  VW. I can live
without their VW symbol,  But they can't stop me from something i own's pic
on the logo....Evil Grin. Look for major logo changes around Jan,2002. My
daughter had an accident monday afternoon and is laid up with a cast on each
foot. (roof related not auto). I'll let her play with the logo, while she's
laid up. Ya'll have a great Thanksgiving ,,Later
