Subject:  was RE: [VB] Binz value - Insurance time - Appraisal Quest

Binz are rare, here is no doubt.  I'd have more on it than what was being
asked for some of the 'professionally' restored 23 window barny deluxes
(around US$50k although I understand the market has dropped a bit...).
Sorry -
I know you asked for pmail...

The other thing that piqued my interest lately was the reasonably recent
discovery of a LHD standard barny sunroof in Texas(?).  I myself know of 
only one other (LHD in the UK). RHDs? Is the barny sunroof rarer than the
binz?  
Fewer produced? Maybe more produced but fewer surviving?

>My thoughts:

>I have been looking for over three years trying to find all the remaining
Binz and from what I have found there are about 20 restorable Binz left.  Of
the 20 a couple are questionable.  I'm sure there are a few more out there
but not many.  Production on the Binz was about the same as or less than the
Hebmueller.  About 60 Hebs survived compared to the 20 Binz.  I hesitate to
draw the correlation between the Binz and the Heb as the Binz will probably
never be worth what the Heb is but that would provide an upper limit.  As
far as the low end I would say some percentage above a regular restored
early crew cab.  Will be interesting to hear what folks have to say.

Thanks,
