Subject: Temp on first start up.

I am getting ready to start the 1600 SP doghouse engine I built. All I have
to do is to put the carb on. I think I will run it on the stand for the
first 20 minute run in. I know that fresh engines run hot, but what is too
hot during this time? When do I panic? Is 2000 rpm the correct speed?

I am getting nervous. :-(
