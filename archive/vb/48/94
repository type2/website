Hello AL

    Make sure your back brake drums are tight. If the Axle nut is in anyway
loose you will get this clicking sound. I have had this sound before and it
almost sounds like when you grind your teeth together but higher pitched it
will ruin your drums. I have already killed on drum because I didn't catch
in time. It had loosed up after about 2000 miles after I had put in a new
trans in and rebuilt the reduction boxes. :-(
