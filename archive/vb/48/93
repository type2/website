Subject: Terrible sound, help!

Well, I have the motor running, and this is not in any way related to the
motor, I am sure.
Car rolling 15 mph (doesn't matter happens at any speed, to almost stopped.
Clutch not depressed, engine off, trans in neutral (this was to diagnose.,
the sound is also in gear, with engine running at any speed)

Sound: teriible clicking kind of sound, rythmic and loud, drowns out motor,
worse when turning.
Could find no loose body components or things amiss with brakes, sound is
powerful enough to make whole bus seem as if it's amplifying it.

Assumption: Bad differential? Of course in the brand new rebuild I got.....
Let me know if you have any other ideas, it was fun to drive her after 9
months, but I am wiped and don't want to pull the trans like I know I am
headed for.
TIA,
AL
