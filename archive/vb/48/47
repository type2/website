  I found a great bus heater for sale.  It is from a 61 bus and the person 
  selling it says that it was removed and stored by the original owner in the 
  attic since then.  The pictures I saw look great and he says it is complete 
  except the pipe from the heater to the cabin (has exhaust pipe, etc.). 

  His email is <m00neyesb(-at-)aol.com>  Note that I have nothing to do with this 
  guy and I don't know him.  I just saw it and was going to jump on it until I 
  saw the size of a bus heater.  They are much larger than the bug heaters.
