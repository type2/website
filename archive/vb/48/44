It's industrial.  I've also told people it's for a Barndoor with no rear
bumper with no real proof of that fact.

I've had a few of those...

 I recently bought a crank handle off of ebay and it hits the bumper on
my
 57, was there a barn door specific handle or maybe its for an indistrial=

 engine?
