Even nicer (I think), is what I've been doing on my buses, which is
install double-walled neoprene 1/4" ID line at the tank - once, and take
it thru the left-side firewall thru an appropriate size hole, to a
shut-off valve rated for gasoline/oil (available at West Marine), then you
have the option of going straight to the fuel pump, or what I do, which is
to mount a Facet electronic fuel pump on the left side, take the
output via VW webbed line into the carb, with an after-market block-off
plate where the pump used to be. Works great for decades. For engine
removal, I disconnect it at the carb, stuff the slightly dripping line
with my one-inch length of old metal original fuel line that has its other
end crimped tightly, and that's it. 
NO fuel in the face, no hassles, no nothin'. Just easy quick engine
removal. My two upper bolts are glued in place, as previously
described here, and I'm using that flat ratcheted 17mm wrench from
Sears/Proto. 15 minutes, no gas in face, no engine fire from metal fuel
line thru fan housing. Engine's out.
