Ah stick to your guns Jerry. You just can't keep em all happy. Remember the
5-90-5 rule 5% will love you,90% are normal and 5% aren't worth the effort
to scrap em off your shoes. I would think if their useing a sunbrella
product,it would be lighter but stronger. I mean they only use it for
complete canvas on boats.
