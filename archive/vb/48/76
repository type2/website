Boy, I'd love to see how 'PM' could be made into a VW logo.

I work at a VW Dealer that also has Lincoln/Mercury.  I feel sorry for
those of you who have never tried to buy parts for cars much newer than
our old buses.  I got yelled (yes, actually yelled) at last week by some
irritated old lady because a sunvisor for her 93 Villager is NLA ('Not
Replaced' is the Ford term).  Just 3 weeks before, I received my new
sunvisor for my 86 vanagon syncro.

Don't even get me started on Merkurs and Scorpios!!

VW is just like every other car maker out there.  They all supply parts
where the volume is - NEW.
