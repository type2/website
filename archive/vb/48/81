I have owned nothing but VW's (Air and Water cooled) for the last 15 years.
Due to the latest round of harassment by VOA when it came time to replace
the Passat I bought a Honda.  I have to buy another car soon as well.  Doubt
it will be a VW either.  Their actions are hurting them they just don't know
it yet.
