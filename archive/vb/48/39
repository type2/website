Subject: Canopies/tilts  

  All this talk of canopies made me post this offer. I have a "LOOKS to be
NOS" single cab canopy with red stitching, perfect window etc, no mildew or
mold and a couple little stains that I will TRADE for a like canopy for my
1960  original owner, rust free DC currently going through total
resurrection.
  Find me my CANOPY so I don't cut this one down to fit.
