tent allot of use, so I am not concerned with getting a 'correct' tent, but
rather a good RELIABLE tent.  Looking at past posts, I found the site:

Has anyone purchased one of their tents?  Good/Bad experiences? >>

Hey, that's my website.  I didn't see any other replies so I thought I would 
comment a little on the tents we sell.

We have 3 different models of the standard bus tent, Komet, Adria and Nizza.  
These use a steel frame and you toss the canvas over the top.  They have lots 
of room and are great for camping.  The tents are well made and hold up 
great.  Just make sure you stake the tent down properly and use the guy ropes 
(storm bracing) 

I would be happy to discuss pricing and specifics on all the tents we offer, 
which is currently 5 models, if you email me at this address, or through our 
website http://EuroCampers.com
