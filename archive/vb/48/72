You've been nervous about this for a LOOONG time!  Who are you trying to fool?  HAHAHAH!!!  (I
mean that with the BEST of intentions) ;)

I may soon be corrected after this post, but 2-2250rpm or so should do just fine.  A little less
rpm will set and seat and seal everything just as well as a little higher.  That ballpark of 2000
would be a good place to work with.

Running it on the stand for burn in will give you some warm temps, but should be nothing to worry
about.  My suggestion would be to leave your thermometer in the Turkey and simply allow it to
"burn in".

ABOVE ALL... Don't panic!  The carefulness and meticulousness that you have displayed should prove
it's weight from here on out.  The only one thing I would have done different with everything that
you HAVE done is used a new or at least a different case.

The sensible precautions that can be read/found/learned/listened should be adhered to with
diligence, but not to the point of exhaustion.  You must understand, of course, that a lot of
material that one might find to practice at this crucial moment in a motor's life is also written
for a general consumer who, without a thorough knowledge of what is taking place, expects their
"new" motor to fire right up, be set perfectly, and then plans to drag the nearest 5.0 that he
stops beside at the red light.  Then... after a 100 miles (or less) returns to his mechanic and
explains why he/she can't finger out why their engine already "ain't runnin' good" or "sounds like
*h*t", etc... (VW or otherwise)

Good luck, Doc!  I hope it works out for you and you get many thousands of miles of happy motoring
and Full Mooning!
