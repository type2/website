Rubber lines are passed through holes in sheet metal quite often in
automotive applications.  A rubber grommet, or even better a metal flange
around the hole will protect things well.

My '71 bus came to me with a rubber fuel line passing between the front
tin and the firewall seal.  It had been that way for >10K miles, which is
when the engine was removed by a mechanic for a clutch problem.  That
"mechanic" is no longer in business, thank goodness.
