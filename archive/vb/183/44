Sorry to sound ignorant but what does PM'ed mean?  I assume little or no
maintenance but can't think of what it could stand for.
Thanks

My single although only having 50K miles lived a life of not being PM'ed and
anything that had a grease fitting was bad.

You do not need to use a fixed length tie rod,just make sure you set an
adjustable one at the right length so the steering geometry is not
altered.If you want to be sure about the length being kept you could tack
weld the tie rods and lock nuts on that side so a shop working on it won't
screw it up.

Tie rods should be no different between LHD and RHD vehicles for a typeII as
they anchor to the swing lever in the center of the beam.
