Subject: [VB] Funny trans noise


My bus has developed a funny trans noise, and it's almost funny
as in 'ha ha!' funny.  I was at a light this AM, out of gear,
foot off the clutch, and I revved it a little to get some heat
flowing.  It started making a Three Stooges sort of "woo-woo-woo!"
sound, which gave me a little giggle, even though I know it's not
a good thing.  The noise went away when I put the clutch in.

Any ideas?  I know it's not something that can be "adjusted".  This
transmission has been giving me problems - getting hard to shift and
whatnot.  OTC rebuilds are crap; this one's only lasted maybe 3 years,
and I don't drive it that often at that.
