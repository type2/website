the metal bracket should be fairly easily removable, at least it was for my
'65 not sure if it changed much over the years.
in my bus it was held in by two bolts that went in from the inside the cab,
throught the part that the shifter rides in, then through a reverse lockout
plate, then through the body, then throught the shift rod bracket and into
the nuts....

hope that makes sense-it is easier in a picture but i guess a picture is
worth a thousand....

it should come out easily, and i think a new one is fairly cheap(under $10).
will improve shifting, guaranteed....
