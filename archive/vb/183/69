The throwout bearing is spinning when you step on the clutch.
The trans input shaft stops spinning when you step on the clutch.
I would be more inclined to believe the input shaft bearing in the
transmission is bad.
NOT the pinion bearing, it only turns when you are moving.
Parked, with the engine running, foot off the clutch: only the input shaft is
turning.
