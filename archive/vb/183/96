Subject: troubleshoot weird engine noise/vibe

Yesterday as I was leaving Home D(-at-)pot, I noticed when
my rpm's got up just before time to shift to 2nd,
there was some vibration going on. I pulled over,
stuck my head in the engine compartment and gave it
some rpm's to listen more closely. It sounded kinda
like on water cooled vehicles when the fan clutch
kicks in on a hot day, if you have ever heard that
sound before. Kind like a whirring noise. Anyways, it
does it after your give it some rpm's. And along with
it comes some vibration. To me, it sounds as if it's
coming from inside the fan shroud. Any ideas on what
may be causing this? Never heard or felt it do this
till yesterday. The engine is a fresh (3000 or so
miles) 1776 dp with dual 34 webers.
Up until now, it's performed flawlessly. Still does
except for that damned annoying noise and vibration.
Any imput would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
3DPete
