Subject: Re: [VB] With New Rubber, Vents Won't Close

  I've had the same problem as you Sue.  In fact, I still have the
problem.  It is one of the harder things to do when restoring, since the
rubber tends to pop out just when you think your making progress putting
the seating the inner channel on both sides.

  As Sean pointed out it may be the metal latches on the vent wing. But I
thought that may be the case too, and it still is open 1/8"-1/4".  Since I
was foolishly in a hurry when replacing them, I first used the flat roll
of rubber as the seal between the vent window frame and glass.  That was
bunk!  Then Ronnie said used "hot glass" or silicon instead of rubber,
Although that worked it looked bunk!  I finally got some of the OG cloth
coated rubber (David Mayes style resto) and that looks and works great,
but still the is vent wing open 1/8"-1/4".  I am now seriously thinking
the new rubber I bought is bunk, when comparing the new and old, there is
a seam on the inside that is not on my OG german 61 SC and that channel
seems to be block the closing of the vent wing completly.  As horrible as
it sounds, unless someone knows better, I may cut the rubber seam so it
can close cause it is getting colder and I want it to shut too!
