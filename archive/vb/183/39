My single although only having 50K miles lived a life of not being PM'ed and anything that had a grease fitting was bad.

You do not need to use a fixed length tie rod,just make sure you set an adjustable one at the right length so the steering geometry is not altered.If you want to be sure about the length being kept you could tack weld the tie rods and lock nuts on that side so a shop working on it won't screw it up.

Tie rods should be no different between LHD and RHD vehicles for a typeII as they anchor to the swing lever in the center of the beam.

Hi Ted,

Thanks for your reply.  What was wrong with your drag link?  
 It is very difficult to get the
fixed length tie rod in the UK now(possibly a RHD only part??
