Also overfilling your tank, (like I do), and whipping around corners and
causing gas to spill out the neck around the bad gas cap seal causing fumes
to get into the fresh air system.

my fault!

Kevin-
I have had that same smell in my bus as of late. I found out where the gas
smell is coming from which is from the fuel cap. If it does not seal
good(hey why won't that oil cap seal on the filler neck?)the fumes escape as
the engine compartment warms the fuel in the tank causing fumes which since
the weather has gotten a bit nippier I have hooked up my heater which gets
it air supply from the engine fan located about 16" from said fumigating
filler neck and the heater boxes not having the most air tight flapper seal
leaking air by it to enter the cab via the duct system and arriving at your
nose.
