Call me an optimist but there is one more huge advantage (that's 2 all together)
of not having any VW shops or seeing other VW's on the road........
When you drive a split window down the road in my little redneck town you are
guaranteed to turn a lot of heads because you are practically a freak for
driving such a vehicle. I love that!!!
Funny.........I'm a freak because I don't drive an old rusted out POS pickup
with a confederate flag front license plate.
