Subject: SOUND DAMPNER?

Someone mentioned
" The
silencers for the ducts are packed with what seems to be a cotton like
material...."

huh?  Is there some sort of sound dampner in the heating system.  I don;t have
any.  Where does it go and what material would be suitable?  Doesn't stuffing
cotton in the heater duct block the already measly air flow?

It makes sense I am missing something because I can hear my engine whrring
merrily away from my defrost vents...

Thanks!
