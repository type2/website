Subject: re:sound damper/fuel smell

if you look at the tube coming out of the heater boxes-towards the front of
the bus:

first there is a metal flexible tube that is encased in a grey vinyl clad
sleeve. This tube goes into a metal grey sound dampening tube. this tube is
metal, not neccessarily round on the outside, but if you looked inside you
would see it is clear shot right through the middle, but around the edges of
this thing you would see a metal mesh, then some batting type material on
the other side of the metal mesh. i think this whol thing is supposed to act
like a muffler for your heating system.....

i think for my fuel smell problem, i am going to try to disconnect one side
of the heating system, run it for a while, and see of the smell subsides,
then try the other.
