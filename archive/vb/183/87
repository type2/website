Subject: Re: [VB] Brake pedal return spring

You have to remove the brake pedal assembly from the frame, clean and relube 
it, and install it with a good spring.  Look where the pedal pivots- there is 
a big nut I think at one end- anyway it is fairly straightforward to 
disassemble.  Might need a drift and a mallet to remove it.  Unbolt the pedal 
from the assembly first... 13mm nut and bolt.  Umm- have to remove MC push 
rod bit as well, before removing the assembly.   Do you have a Bentley?
