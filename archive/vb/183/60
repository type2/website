You "left coaster's" are lucky that you are at least with in driving distance of
any VW shop. I recently received a new trany from Strictly VW (very helpful
people). I think the shipping was $80. It is very slim pickins here in Indiana for
a reputable VW shop. The positive side is that it forces me to try to figure
things out on my own with a little help from the "Listees".
By the way, THANKS!
