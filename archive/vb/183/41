Subject: re:front end questions

was asked:
"When I get the front shift rod off, should I replace anything whilst I am
doing it, or is it just a case of putting it back together with lots of
grease?"

***********

When removing the front shift rod...check the bushing that the shift rod
goes through, it is a plastic type thing, with a metal ring on it. if
cracked or worn replace. Also check that metal bracket that the bushing sits
in...it should be a circle not oval. And lastly check the plate inside the
cab, easy  to replace while you are at it...thes parts are all very cheap
considering what they can improve...

hope that makes sense.
