Subject: Seat frames

I mainly absorb the information you all provide, rather than post, but I am
curious about some seats that I have found. I have not gotten pictures of
them yet, but I will post them soon.
I think I found the original middle seat and front seat, but they are just
the wire framework. It seems that they can just be cleaned up, sandblasted
to remove rust, and then recovered. It may seem like I have answered my
question, but not sure. Most of the buses I have seen people selling seem
way too rusted, but everyone I have heard coments from about them say they
are pretty good.
Just wondering if a seat frame would be enough to use to have some others in
the bus.
Awaiting your replies...
