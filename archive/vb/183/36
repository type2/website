Subject: Re: [VB] come along?

I have Little Mule I pulled out of a scrap yard that I used to service their
trucks. I use it at work. Part of the handle sleeve is broken but it still
works fine.

Personally I like the chain type come-a-longs with the ratchet handle. Allot
safer to used (i.e. pinched fingers and load release) plus they are gear
reduction driven (easier to pull loads with) but the downside is a good one
could cost $1-500 maybe more for the aluminum models. Solid ratcheting arm
is the best, I have folded a hollow stamped steel one (well pulling a 2000#
X 6' dia. yucca root ball out of the ground while cutting it out may have
had some effect on the 3/4 ton one I bent). But it all comes down to is the
pocket book making the call.

Mechanics NEVER abuse their tools. Man I tell you that 8' snipe on that
breaker bar will break that 36mm nut loose....a day filled with all the
breaker bars in 2 Sears stores broken in 1 day. Well the last one made it
but I broke it another day...lol.
