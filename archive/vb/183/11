Subject: luggage rack

Hi List,
OK, I drive a crew cab, but my wife recently aquired a
68 vert and wants an engine deck lid mount luggage
rack. I can't seem to locate one. Does anyone know if
there is a rack for a vert or only for sedans? Where
should I look. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks,
3DPete
