Subject: Re: [VB] Funny trans noise

if the noise is there when the clutch pedal is NOT depressed, it is 
your pinion  bearing- i recently had my tranny replaced due to this.
bearing was actually spinning in the case, happily getting looser and 
looser. eventually i guess it pops foward into the nose cone anfd 
binds the tranny  :P
