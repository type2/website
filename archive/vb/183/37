Subject: Re: Bon Ami alternative

There is a similar product that's called Bartender's Friend.
Also packaged in gold paperboard cylinder.  I use it whenever I can't
find Bon Ami - it's designed to scrub stainless-steel sinks, countertops,
etc - not to scratch them... might work for you.

But of course the official website http://www.faultless.com/ may be helpful
too :)

to repair/ replace belly panels? (not LaVere's - though he *is* very
good).
