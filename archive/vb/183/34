Sean-
There is a company called Apple Towing in Lawndale and they do allot of
towing of charity donated cars. I don't know whether the still run up and
down the state but at times they run up empty and if your not in a big rush
you may be able to work a deal with them to bring it up on an empty run.
Those runs are made in a flat bed w/ a wheellift too. The owners name is
Harold. But don't get him going about Freightliner......trust me. But he is
a pretty good ol guy.
