Not really, it is just starting to go away, it's cold out so the grease
inside is harder. When you put pressure on it the noise will go away. The
one in my DD has been doing that for the last few thisand miles, just to
lazy to pull the engine to fix.

Urm, but the noise went away when I pushed on the clutch; the TOB
should not be doing anything at that point.
