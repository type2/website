 When I get the front shift rod off, should I replace anything whilst I am

when you undo the two bolts holding the shift stick to the floor of the cab, 
you are unscrewing them from that bracket.   With the bolts off, you can 
slide that bracket off.   Like someone else said, they are under $10.   When 
I got my 65 westy, that bracket was rusted through,  poor bus had been parked 
for three years probably because that rusted through! I posted my fix it up 
story I think about 5 years ago, included that shift issue.
What to replace?  Anything worn.  plate on floor under shift stick? new shift 
bushings in front, and middle?  to get to the rear bushing you have to pull 
the tranny.  I'd remove the cables, clean out the tubes, install fresh cables 
with grease, and install the rubber dust covers at the ends of the cable 
tubes.
