Subject: stock vs custom... progress on the 59 dc

ok, a day late and a dollar short.  While you all were debating on the
merits of stock vs custom, I was traveling and then this past weekend I got
about 6 hours of work in on the double cab... Search Thom's porn site (i.e.
look under double cabs or search for 'David Mayes') for a few latest pics of
my restored horn wire and my shift rod coupler and boot... some may recall
my relentless search for a few nice shift rod boots.  (I'm still looking for
a few more for the tipper by the way, top dollar always paid)   Anyway, my
bent is to piss off both camps and do the AR, bolt perfect resto but chrome
it. :-0    Most people roll their eyes hehehehe but then again, I know a few
vintage nazis out there that have incorrect bolts or have succumbed to an
old speed part or two on their bus.   Long live westys like Robs and bagged
customs like Johns.

Aint this a great hobby?

David
