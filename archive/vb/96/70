I don't have any specific comments on VW window seals but I can talk
about refrigerator door seals as I sold appliance parts in a previous
job.  Ideally the door seals would be shipped flat on a big piece of
cardboard the size of the refrigerator door, but that is bulky and
expensive, so they are folded up a couple of times and stuffed in a
long skinny box.  If you pull them right out of the box and try to
put them on the refrigerator, you'll never get the seal to lay flat.
If you dunk the seal in a bucket of hot water (not boiling, but pretty
hot) first, it is much easier to work with.  Another option is to
unfold the seal, tape it down to something, and let it sit out in
the sun all afternoon.  A similar treatment would probably help
with VW window seals, even if they are somewhat the wrong size.
