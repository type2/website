Subject: Re: [VB] Drop Spindle Installation?

I used stock pins, but still cannot use the dustcaps at all because of
clearance, and if I'm not mistaken, the side that used to have the dust cap,
is now on the inside of the spindle.

I have no experience with repo pins, so I didn't know the heads were
thicker.  I don't think if you removed a 1/16 of an inch to clearance the
pins (on the spindle side, or maybe even the pins themselves), you would
lose any strength.  It's pretty thick back there.

Later
