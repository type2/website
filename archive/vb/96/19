Subject: window seal fit? & replacement ina 61

I got my corner window bus years ago and thought it'd get restored fairly 
soon, so I only cleaned up the windsheild seal area.   I ordered 6 WW fixed 
side window seals and 2 corner window seals, to replace the crusty 41 year 
old ones.  The solid ones were pretty straight forward to replace, thought it 
might be harder as they are laminated sigla, but managed not to break any.  
The WW seals seemed a little large and loose on the glass.   Made it hard to 
get the glass & seal in place- had to push really hard, but managed not to 
break any. it was harder on the pass side than the drivers side. I had 
similar issues when doing the 65 westy.   At the time I thought that was 
cause of the paint layers, but now I don't think so.   They do have a good 
seal when installed, though, tuck down nice all around the outside of the 
glass.

Anyone have comments on these seals - or another brand that fit better?

5 of the window ledges were painted white like to top of the bus.  one of the 
ones on the pass side was primer !  Dunno if they just forgot to get that 
area when they painted or what.  A little of the area at the bottom  that was 
not covered by the seal is surface rusted- I think that was just primer as 
well.  Sloppy original paint job.
 Oh, well.

Haven't done the corner window seals yet.  wish me luck.  Don't want to break 
that glass.

Then I washed the bus and polished it with a fluffy pad on an orbital sander 
and rubbing compound.  Had to use lots of water to keep it soggy.  After I 
washed off the polishing compound it was clear that this really helped bring 
the old SWR paint back.  It's a deeper colour now.   Gave it a waxing too.  
That stuff is fun.  :)
