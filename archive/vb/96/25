It actually doesn't! My paint was in my shop with up and down weather of 
Texas. I shook it up real good before opening. I stuck a stir stick in the 
can and felt some hardened goo at the bottom. I went ahead and used the 
liquid that was there and it seems to have worked fine. But I wouldn't 
count on it still being good. And that's one of the reasons I wanted to get 
it done quick. I am glad what I had was usable though.
