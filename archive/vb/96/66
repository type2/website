Subject: [VB] New OACDP resource

Hello list!  Over at the OACDP we have finished putting up a new resource.
It's the 1965 edition of VW's Damage Numbers reference.  It was provided
to us by Eric & Barb...ah, yes you know them.  Maybe not me but them for
sure ;-)  So here's the address for the site:

http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/

And for the new resource in particular:

http://wow.atasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/damage.html.gz

Bus content: there's bus stuff in this book.

Bus content MK II: I've finally got some spare cash coming up so I can
fix my Westy's floor...!  No more Icehouse boxes or Tombstone pizza
backers keeping my feet dry!  No more bonfires in the package tray to
keep warm!
