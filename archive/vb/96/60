Subject: Re: [VB] Passing of a friend

I know how you feel. I lost my best friend and by far
the best german bus accessory, Ben, a German
Shorthair, in November. I raised him from a pup and he
too grew up traveling in my 65 Westfalia. That dog was
more traveled than most people I know and I swear if
he had thumbs I would have had to hide the keys
because I think he would have taken her out when I
wasn't looking! Hang in there, he would!
