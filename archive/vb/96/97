stock, stock, stock, stock, stock, new (oil cooler), don't think so, tranny
is stock AFAIK... also I don't go over 55 plus slowing down doesn't make a
significant difference, I've driven at 40mph in the desert and still had
temps over 260... cooling tin all there...  I think I've ruled out all the
etc's which is why I'm asking about the carb jetting.  Guess I have to pull
out all the jets that are in the carb and look at them?  Are the sizes
stamped on them?
