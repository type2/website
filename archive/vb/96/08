Subject: Finally fixed that Dogleg!!!

Well I had something I havn't had in a very long time...a weekend 
where I didn't have anything I HAD to do! So I took advantage of it 
and decided to try and fix my driver's dogleg on my '59 Kombi.

A little less than a year ago, I had an accident. The front driver's 
wheel lugnuts weren't torqued good and worked loose and the wheel 
came off! Luckily I was only going about 20MPH and no one was hurt. 
But the driver's dogleg was damaged pretty badly. I've been driving 
it like that ever since.

So this weekend I started by pulling and banging the dogleg back into 
shape. It was pretty bad, but I was able to get it fairly straight. 
Part of the dogleg had pulled loose from it's spot welds. So I tacked 
it back on using my MIG welder. Also welded up a few "cuts" in the 
metal from it being bent. I then used some filler to smooth out the 
dimpled metal.

Next I sanded and worked the filler as good as I could. I masked and 
covered the bus with plastic and then sprayed about 3 coats of 
primer/surfacer. After that dried, I did my final sanding. Luckily, I 
still have some paint left from when I painted my bus a couple years 
back. So I mixed some up and sprayed it on. And that's were it is 
right now. Drying and waiting to be put back on the road.

The job isn't perfect or anything, but it definatly matches the 
quality of the rest of my bus. And I was able to get it all done this 
weekend, which was my goal...so I'm happy!

There's a picture of it here: http://www.type2guy.com/temp/dogleg.jpg

p.s. In between waiting for primer and paint to dry, I was able to go 
to the barn where I've got a parts "bay" bus sitting. I'm actually 
trading this one for something else, but the deal is I get the gas 
tank. So I yanked it out of there. It's gonna go into my 23-window. 
Also went ahead and cut out the wheel wells. Who knows!?!?!
