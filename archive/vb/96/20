the problem with a motion detector alarm is that they have a lot of false
alarms.  False alarms are so common that people tend to ignore car alarms
hereabouts.

A better system is one that senses doors opening, combined with a tilt
sensor that goes off if the vehicle is tilted more than 2 degrees from
where it was set.  This setup should never give a false alarm.
