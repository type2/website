4 inches is not excessive (that was side to side)!  That's actually only 2
inches till a wheel moves (and probably closer to 1 3/4").  If Bentley said
1" then that means I'm only 1" out of spec.  For a 43yr old steering box, I
think that's great, and also considering the steering wheel is about as big
as a hula hoop. Hell, my company vehicle has almost that much, and it only
has 20k miles on it.
