Subject: Bubble flare tool?

Hi Listees,

I am in the process of replacing the rusted steel brake lines on my '67 EZ
Camper. I have found the brake lines but they are too long, way too long. I
would like to cut them down and re-flare them. I have not been able to find
a reasonably priced bubble flaring tool (i.e. $30.00). Anyone have any luck
in finding one of those tools?

Thanks,

Rocky
