Well, thanks to everybody that helped me get my bus
home to Albuquerque.  I limped in to Corona de Tucson
and got towed home.  Thanks to Ronnie, Kyle, Richard
for the tow bar, every one else who helped, and
especially to John Kyte for driving his truck 400 plus
miles towing my bus AND the singlewheel trailer!

Having my first Vodka and Tonic of the day.
