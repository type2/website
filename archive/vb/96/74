WOW, and you aren't running lean and hot ? With the duration on the Engle
100, I would be running at least 127 to 132 main.

Brosol H30/31 on 1600sp:
Mains 112.5
Idle/Pilot 65
Aux 45
It is working well for me, I get above 20mpg pretty much regardless of
where or how I drive. (except breaking trail through the snow with
chains on a rough dirt road in first and sometimes second gear, that
kills the gas mileage!)  I got my jets from a local bug shop for maybe
$3/each. I would bet Ronnie at Type2Parts and Ron at the Bus Depot both
have them. If you are popping open your carb you might as well treat
yourself to a rebuild kit, maybe $15 or less. Good luck, Joel

Joel,

I agree.  I'm running a new 30/31 and my VW guy who ran in my new motor
for me(lack of time) told me these needed a 127.5 so I said OK. Now with
about 600 miles on it I think it is too rich (smell and only 17mpg on a
totally stock 1600 sp).

What jets would you suggest?  Where do you get them from.

Thanks!

Steve
