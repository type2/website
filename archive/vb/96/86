Subject: carb jetting - new concept for me ??

Hi all,
I've noticed several mentions of correct carburetor jetting and have to
admit I'm pretty clueless about it.  I am wondering if perhaps this is the
source of my persistent overheating (running at around 260+ in summer on
long (2 hours or more) highway drives at speeds of 50-55mph).

The carb I am using is a Bocar 30 pict-1, sold by Cal Imports as a Solex but
I guess it's an aftermarket equivalent???  Straight out of the box about 3
years ago.  I'm running a 1600 sp engine, 009 distributor.  Anyone have a
guess as to whether I need to change the jet?  And are we talking about the
one behind the float bowl drain plug or???

Thanks in advance,
Diana
