Subject: Re: [VB] Hare-brained heater scheme???

Hey, nothing wrong with a little thinking, but there are a couple
considerations you may have overlooked.

1.  Your 6volt South Wind can be converted to 12 by connecting the ground of
one motor to the power of the other, putting the motors in series.

2.  A gasoline heater requires air for combustion and you should use an
outside source so you don't have worry about taking air from inside the bus,
which means a vent to the outside.  The SW heaters used a rubber hose to get
outside air.

3.  You need to vent the exhaust outside towards the outer edge of the bus.
The exhaust is around 1 1/4" which is bigger than the icebox drain hole I
believe.

4.  If you've replaced your fuel lines and put fresh seals in the burner and
fuel pump, you won't have any worries about fuel leaks.
