Hi there,

Are you sure it's the Bocar?
Some other questions related to high heat situations first....

Is the exhaust pipe color gray or rich black? This will indicate need for
jet changes....
Are all the engine compartment seals in place with no holes in the sheet
metal?
Is the engine timing correct to specs??
