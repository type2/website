4 inches (2 each way)?!? that's beyond way 
excessive, according to vw's spec of 1 inch max. anyway, glad to hear it's fine 
otherwise.

 

i have a 59 westy, original front end, 251/75 15's 
(stock height and speedo accurate, constantly checked by those roadside "your 
speed is.." radar things), original grease fitting tie rod ends, original grease 
fitting draglink, tight spindles (all of which i grease, almost religiously), 
alignment good, but i have a new brazilian trw steering box. the steering is 
amazingly firm, not stiff, and handles better than any other bus i've ever 
owned. i can let go of the wheel at any speed, and it goes straight, no wander. 
i can steer with a very light touch, like one finger, at speed.

 

it's really hard to say. any component worn out, 
bad alignment, wheel bearings out of adjustment? bad shocks? bad steering 
damper? is the vehicle lowered?

  My steering box


has about 4 inches of play in it (in other words, my box will go 2 
inches

one way before moving, and 2 inches the other, which is way less than my 
'67

westy, and I'm measuring this at the two arms on the steering wheel), and 
I

don't think that is excessive. It steers straight as an arrow, and 
doesn't

bump steer in turns or anywhere else.....
---AND---


I have replaced everything under the '63 bus but the steering box, and I 
have adjusted that. I still have some wandering and when I hit those little 
bumps on the traffic lines it will lurch to the left or right. I have low 
profile tires which may add to the problem, but it shouldn't be this bad.

 

My question is; how good can the steering get on an old bus, and If I 
replace the steering box will I see a great 
improvement?
