I know the price seems high, but a lot of shops I know will close the door 
when they see a v-dub rolling up to the door.  They can be quite a bit of 
work.  I would get more estimates and never share the first one with the 
next.  I do believe it could be done cheaper, but I haven't see the vehicle 
either.
