Subject: got my new bus

I just got in with my new bus. A 62 15 window deluxe. It is pretty complete
but the while thing is covered in peeling paint and surface rust. I havent
yet decided what i am gonna do with it.  I would like to make it a driver
but it needs rockers, doglegs, floors, out riggers ,all the doors ,,,,,,,,,
ugh,
I will see if i can get some pics up on the net.
