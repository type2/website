You do NOT need a 6 volt battery for a 6v heaters.  Since each heater has 2
fans if you run them in tandem on and then from the one to the next that
will make it a 12v system.  You might have to change the coil but I think
that is it.  Ask Rick Taylor?  He know what needs to be done

> Me again, different subject. When it rains, I have too much time on my
hands to think about bus projects. I would like everyone's opinion on a
set-up I have envisioned for putting a gas heater in my westy.   Here's the
idea: I have removed my sink\icebox to make more room for the kids and the
dog.  This leaves the hole in the floor where the drain exits open.  I have
gotten a line on a couple of 6V South Wind gas heaters and my tentative plan
is to make a self-contained heating system. Basically I would build a "box"
that contained the heater unit, a 6 volt (or 12 depending on the heater)
battery, and possibly even an independent small gas holding tank.  The box
would be vented on both ends to allow for heat circulation and
re-circulation,  Sitting in the spot where the icebox was and exhausting
through the hole in the floor where the drain was (i.e. NO CUTTING OF ANY
METAL).  The box would have a seat cushion on top to be used as an extra
seat and could be easily removed from!
>  the bus during warm weather or switched into another bus, depending on
which one I wanted to drive that day.  Sounds crazy right? Other variations
on the idea may include tapping into the existing fuel supply of the bus or
moving the independent heater fuel container to under the bus near the
sliding door.  If I use a 12 volt heater, I would probably just tap into the
bus' electrical for power, but it looks like I will have only 6 volt
heaters, in which case the 6 volt battery would have to be pulled out and
re-charged as needed. This system would also get the hot heater stuff away
from the fuel tank and engine.  A gas heater mis-hap or fire would only have
the small tank of gas (maybe about 1 gallon) to burn instead of the 15
gallons in the big fuel tank. A gas leak from the heater would not spray an
unlimited supply of gas into the hot engine compartment.
> I, know, I know, this probably sounds stupid! Why not just put in a BN4
like intended? But I really like the idea of not cutting metal, having a
"portable" heat source that can be easily moved from one place to another,
and the creativity of it all intrigues me!  So what do you guys think? Is it
do-able? What considerations have I not thought of?  Rick Taylor, you
retro-fit alot of these old heaters in buses, right? Can you add anything
for me to think about id I decide to do this?  P.S.  It's OK to tell me that
I am nuts, I can take it!!
