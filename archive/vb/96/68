Subject: yes they were volks in my town in 1960

i was browsing through our city historical website with picture and found
one picture from 1960 with a split window bus.
Its in french though, but it says its a 1960 picture of the street!

on this picture you can hardly see a split window with a ladder on the roof,
it was taken in 1964 , the bus must be  new because it doesnt have bullet
turn signal (i have this picture at my house and scanned also, thats why ive
seen that), and its a fire/police station so i bet it was used for fire
department.  Ask me and ill send you the scanned picture where you can see
more details about the split
