Subject: Re: [VB] My new 62 15 window deluxe

hello,
 Is the vin number on the tag below the gas tank to the right??? I am trying
to figure out the VIN so I can find out whether the bus is a 62 or 63 . It
has the lips on the fenders but has the flip/pull door handles on the front
doors. The front doors seem to be the originals and this thing has sat for
the last 20 years so I don't think they have been replaced.
 I picked up a rust free cargo door today that just happens to be original
faded red and whit just like my bus is sposta be...cool

thanks- Bryan
