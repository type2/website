Subject: Has this happened to anyone??

Hi List, 
Last week we took my daughter on a spring break road
trip up in the mountains of NW Arkansas. We were
driving along on a back country road, only doing about
20MPH when I heard a loud "Clunk-de-de-clank" and the
left rear wheel locked completely up on my 63 crew
cab.
I couldn't seem to find the problem, so I called a
frind of mine and he came and got us with a trailer
and took us to his place. We jacked up the truck and
removed the wheel and found that the brake shoes had
come loose and had lodged themselves inside the drum
in such a way that the wheel could not turn. I might
mention that I'm running a 69 or 70 beetle IRS rear
end.We didn't have the parts to fix the problem, so we
took out all the shoes, springs, etc. and blocked of
the brake lines to that wheel and ever-so-gingerly
went on our spring break tour. I was just wondering if
this has ever happened to anyone else?
Thanks,
3DPete
Buck - 63 crewcab
