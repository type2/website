Subject: RE: [VB] Only you can prevent engine fires


Engine fires caused by stock fuel line placement can be easily prevented
by simply re-engineering the fuel line path in one of two easy ways, both
of which I used for decades -.

Get some double-walled neoprene fuel line with the proper inside diameter
(1/4"?), and drill a 1/2" hole in the "firewall" just to the left of the
left side of the engine tin, clamp it to the gas tank outlet, and route
the line through there. Problem solved. You can mount an inline
manual cut-off valve and an electronic fuel
pump right there and enter the 21st century, or just route it through
either metal or other line, over to the carb inlet, making sure that you
use flexible line over to the carb, and clamp it in places (use your
common sense). De-burr the hole, and you won't even need to
line it with anything. I've been running this on my buses for almost 20
years - no fires, no threats, no problems.

Another way of dealing with it quickly and easily, without modifying
anything, is simply to split a 4 inch length of VW fuel line
lengthwise, and slip it over the metal fuel line where it goes thru the
tin piece, replacing the gasket that always fails. I used that for the
first ten years, before routing the line away from the engine. It's easy
and your line will be safe from being cut by the tin.

Everybody should do one of the above immediately, if not sooner.
