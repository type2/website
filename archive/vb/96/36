Subject: RE: [VB] How good can the steering get?

When I first got Rosie, she wandered all over the road. I assumed the front
end was loose. When I sold my old bus, I took the real bus rims off of it
and put them on Rosie, replacing the widened bug rims. All of a sudden, the
front end wasn't loose anymore. Rims that are too wide, or even stock bug
rims (which have a different offset) will significantly affect the steering.
