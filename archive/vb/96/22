Subject: Introduction and Security Device

Hello All

First, I should introduce myself.  My name is Bob, and I just purchased my
1st bus. Actually it is also my 1st VW, although I had access to my sisters
bug in the late 60's early 70's.   It is a 67 Kombi, very nice with
relativly new paint and engine.  Interior needs some work, but no rust.  The
fellow who I bought it from had it for almost 20 years. I am very pleased.

My question is also on security devices. ( I apologize to the group if you
already covered this, but I just signed on.)I understand there is a problem
with nice old VW's being a target.  What do you folks recommend?  I have an
UNGO system on my 83 911SC, but as people are mentioning, no one pays
attention to alarms anymore.  I have seen the shift lock systems for bugs,
do they work for a 67 bus?   Any recommendations as to a good brand?

Thanks!!

Bob
67 Bus
83 911Sc
58 XK150S OTS
