Subject: 67 Double Cab resto

I have never paid for a full on restoration but a close friend of mine
just got a bid on his 67 Double Cab and I was going to see if any of you
had some input on cost and maybe some other places he should look into.
He has all of the welding completed and the quote is for sandblasting
and then POR 15 the whole double cab and then bodywork and primer. The
bodywork is the smoothing process not welding in major panels as that
has been done already. The quote was for $4700. This would still need a
good paint job on top of that number. It seems a little high to me since
I know this guy is not looking for a show truck just a really nice
driver. Anyone have any recommendations for shops in the Seattle area? I
would bet he would be willing to go as far as Portland OR if there was a
good shop for the right price. He has more money than time, with two
little kids and a more than full time job so you can skip the learn to
do it yourself advice. We have done a couple together and I know he does
not want to go that way this time.
thanks in advance,
