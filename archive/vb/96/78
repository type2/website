FW: Has anyone noticed the continuing BFY lie? The May issue of Hot VWs
arrived at my door today and I was very disappointed to see the same BFY
ad--BFY has not had the European bus assemblies since August (seven months)
and they continue to listing them.  How is this different from bait and
switch advertising that every state considers illegal?

I've called BFY a few times (August, November, December, February & March)
to see if they actually found some new headlight assemblies and I get the
same answer—they sold all the assemblies quickly and did not anticipate
getting any more.  Last month the guy on the other end of the phone offered
a lame excuse about the difficulties of working with his artist.

I've also contacted Hot VWs about this-I spoke to someone in the advertising
department in mid-February and spoke to and wrote a letter to the managing
editor in mid-March.  But the ad still runs.

Assuming that truthful advertising offers information, product offerings,
and pricing, what value does this BFY ad offer readers?  What does this say
about the true mission of Hot VWs?  What does this say about BFY's business
practices?

I know the answer.  Both are lame.

Disappointed and still tilting at windmills,
