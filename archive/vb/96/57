I'm in walnut creek and will hopefully have my '65 single cab running by
then so I'd be down for a cruise from here otherwise I'll probably be
looking for a ride.

Well heck,
If there are also others on this side of the Bay, why don't we meet
somewhere
here and cruise down that way.
I'm from Concord and I know there are others locally that are going down
early Sat. am.

We'll have to set up a meeting time and place soon.
