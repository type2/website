Interesting point Kevin makes about "what if" the victim of the crash 
had been a 2003 Corolla.  I remember reading in the New Zealand 
Automobile Association (the AA!) magazine an article about safe cars for 
teenagers to drive.  They recommended old VW beetles.  Said that they 
were stronger than most small japanese cars.  The NZ AA is a major auto 
insurance company in New Zealand.  Yah, driving in NZ you are not 
sharing the road with 80 mph 18 wheelers.....    Gary Gibson
