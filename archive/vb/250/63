I think I read your other reply wrong.  The filters mentioned are thick
cans. My personal favorite is the Purolator "Pure One". It filters down the
finest of all 'spin on' filters. My filter is mounted under the driverside
battery tray area, and have had no problems, even with driving on
dirt/gravel roads.
