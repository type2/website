I respect Jim's reasons for getting a '97 VW for family use.  Safe, 
fast, and A/C!  Still, we effect the economy by spending money and what 
we spend it on.  If you spend money american style, you need to hustle 
for the bucks.  This hustle for the bucks has filled our roads with 18 
wheelers hauling in crap from the 3'd world.  Driving old VWs is a way 
to avoid the need for the big job.  Bob Hoover wrote a sermon years ago 
about all of the money you would not need to make or spend by keeping 
your old bus vs. buying something new.  A cultural revolution in the US 
could be one where we decide to say enough to the rat race.  The careers 
and work that we do for our children may ruin their future.   18 
wheelers!
