Subject: Full flow filter on 1600

My 65 has a mann/mahle OC25 spin on filter on it.

I know from experience over on the type2 list that these filters were far superior to anything available for the type4.

There's also a link in the archives to a very comprehensive filter website where somebody cut open dozens of filters and made comparisons on a variety of design parameters.
