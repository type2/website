You said the "S" word and im pissed right now, so lemme tell you about State farm. Change companies
ASAP.
My 59 ragtop beetle was smashed into from behind by some crazy bitch about a month ago. It was all
her fault and everything, no prob, just get her insurance (state farm) to cover it right? Well state
farm is currently telling me that "FACTORY SHOWROOM 59 sedan beetles are going for 3500 in the
paper" ......... so you can guess what price they want to give me for my unrestored 59 ragtop in
primer (never hit, with new engine, tranny, brakes, rubber, all new mechanicals, no rust, etc)???

$1500. (then minus $100 to buy the beetle back).  "because after all, your beetle is in primer,
sir."

And they dont care that its a ragtop cause they dont think that effects the price cause their
telling me "factory ragtops arent listed in their books". And they dont care that i have $4500 in
receipts on it. And they dont care that the $1500 wouldnt even rebuild my engine to what it was
before let alone replace anything else. All they care about is wether or not it has paint on it, and
mine aint painted.  So just make sure its painted even if its a $250 Maaco special. If a ragtop
beetle wasnt in their books, It sucks to think what will happen when that semi's insurance company
goes to look up a "VW container van" in their books or a "highroof" ?
