Probably, he was hit by external forces in all cases.  No matter what car he
was driving, the accidents would have occurred if he had been in the same

Tom Buese- whose  wife  has been in 2 totals, several other smaller
accidents, all the faults of others, claims she is unlucky while I who
hasn't been in an accident since I was 16 (38 yrs ago) is an aggressive
driver, but lucky! WTF
