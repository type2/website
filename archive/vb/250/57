The HP1 is definitly superior on the outside, but take a PH8A and an HP1,
and cut them open, and you will find the same 'guts'. Cardboard endcaps,
string, and other details that make the Fram line of filter low end quality.
They remain a large manufacturer, because they spend more on advertising
than any other filter company. Truth is, ever since Allied Signal bought
Fram, the quality went down.

Purolator, Amsoil, and Deutch are all good filters when it comes to the
'innards', which matters most to me.
