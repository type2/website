I try to avoid racial stereo <no pun intended> types. The vehicle of choice in
LA in the Microwave aka Phoenix, appears to be either a mid-1980's Ford LTD-4
door with  reflective mylar cowboy hat stickers in the rear window, a late
model Crown Victoria with the first 90day temporary paper tags or overloaded
container trucks with fake UPS, U-Haul and Ryder truck markings on them. 
Trust me that the Beetle is well represented in Mexico City and other areas
within the vast country of Mexico. Judging the entire country of Mexico by the
ant trail of immigrants into Tucson and Phoenix is likened to judging all
Americans by George W Butch and family. Not all of us drive in motorcades,
choke on pretzels and pervert the mass media to our own end.
I suspect that the cliche' hispanic immigrant can not afford the over inflated
wildly hyped prices of the kombis and other VWs. They simply buy something that
is initially affordable, somewhat economical and hauls a lot of persons.
Hmmmm... come to think of it that's why I originally got into VWs and now dont.
