Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Insurance -Good luck

What we are all going to see soon is a complete examination of our 
personal and public lives before we can purchase any kind of insurance.  
Then we will really pay for it.  In Atlanta, GA there is a company, 
ChoicePoint, that mines data on every aspect of our being and sells this 
to the insurance companies.  I got my home owners policy recently canned 
because ChoicePoint reported that I keep a pig in my front yard.  They 
must have mined credit card data of pig food purchases?  ChoicePoint was 
also a major player in the Bush's Florida election "win".  Choicepoint  
informed the state that they could remove 96,000 voters from the roles 
because these folks were felons.  Turns out that less than 6,000 might 
have been ineligible.....  Gary Gibson
