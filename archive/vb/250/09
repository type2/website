Kevin made a good point in an earlier post.

OK, Whatever... Point taken. Every example can be emphasized in any direction.

My inferred meaning was/is that my decision to go with a vehicle that is
equipped with shoulder harnesses, single/dual airbags, windsheild wipers and
window defrosting systems that ~have the potential~ to be more efficient than
the typical splittie bus and has a greater ~potential for~ keeping up with the
maniacal pace of freeway traffic. My choice of vehicle in my example being a
'97 Eurovan Winnebago camper. I am betting the safety of my two young children,
wife and self that the Winnie has a lessened chance of breaking down enroute
to longdistanced or daily travel destinations than the splitty buses that I
have owned or that I/we constantly read about in the average trip report on
this vintage list. Even the reports of fulltime professional
mechanics/partvendor/friends constantly contain accounts of this, that and the
other things going FUBAR enroute to destination X.

I see no need to get into the old contest between aircooled vs.
watercooled as that was not my point. Yes, Kevin's point of a watercooled
Corolla or Minicooper or whatever make or model being trounced by a semitractor
and trailer combo is well taken.

The point is that by the grace of God we go on and that the PLF crew were
frickin lucky to have all come out intact. As all are friends I am extremely
glad for that.

I continue to be a fan and supporter of VWs of most all models but choose for
myself to rely less and less on them for daily driving and long distance trips
with my precious cargo. My '63 bus awaits my attention but it will be a while
before I will thump it with my kids en-tow.
Peace to all~ including Kevin and his well taken point,
