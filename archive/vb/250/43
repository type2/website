Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Insurance

I have insurance with farmers, It's ~$13/ month for insurance on the 53, with 
unlimited milage, but with vaguely worded driving only to events or shows 
restrictitions.     Which means I could drive to the Classic with this insurance 
if I wanted, or to Jerome.   Like the classic plates, they have similar vague 
restrictions.  I think it has a locked garage clause, but that's okay with me. 
 It has an agreed upon value, and I have an appraisal which describes the 
buses unrestored un painted condition.   he insurance company has a copy of it.  
& I do have to have a daily driver insured as well.  Which is another splitty. 
 Dunno how good they were on paying claims as I haven't had to.   Definately 
get an appraisal, which describes your bus, and pictures.

I called around about insurance a while ago and some places won't insure a 
splitty as a daily driver with comprehensive.  or anything over ten years old.
