>mann/mahle OC25 spin on filter<

Do you mean OC25 or OC51?  The OC51 is for the Diesel Rabbit and the 
beefiest VW filter I can think of apparently seeing regular 150PSI 
pressures.

The Purolator 39001 (HP1 version of the 30001) gets my nod compared to a 
OC51.  The only issue I cannot tell is the actual pressure on each that the 
by-pass would be activiated, and I never will know that information so kind 
of moot.  In general the 39001 is beefier than the OC51 and has bigger oil 
passages to flow more oil.

... Plus Purolator is "Made in the USA" which goes a long way in my book 
these days.  Mahle is made in Austria.

In reality both are great filters and cannot go wrong either way, I just 
prefer the 39001.

The Mecca looks awesome and no by-pass valves.
