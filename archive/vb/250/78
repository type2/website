Subject: RE: [VB] Full flow filter on 1600

Quite frankly, since the engine was never designed for a full flow filter,
just a filter screen seemed efficient enough for it, any filter would be
better by far than stock! IMHO

My 65 has a mann/mahle OC25 spin on filter on it.

I know from experience over on the type2 list that these filters were far
superior to anything available for the type4.

There's also a link in the archives to a very comprehensive filter website
where somebody cut open dozens of filters and made comparisons on a variety of
design parameters.
