Subject: RE: [VB] Bus Insurance -Good luck

I'm a little confused on this insurance issue and am a bad example since I
only carry liability. I thought that 30+ year old vehicles were listed as
classics and antiques and fell under a different valuation table to determine
the cost of repair/rebuild. Aren't there insurance companies out there that
provide insurance for classics and antiques. I know my neighbor has special
insurance that cover the full market value of his classic, but they also limit
him in total yearly mileage to get it.

I had a similar conversation with AAA when I was getting
full coverage for my '55 westy.  They looked it up in their
"Gold Book" and had a valuation for a '55 deluxe in showroom
condition (-at-) $1500

I challened them to find *any* 1955 car - hell, even a moped -
in showroom condition for $1500

Remember, an insurance company's ultimate goal is to collect
as much in premiums as they can get away with, and pay out as
little as they can in claims.  That's what they do.
