As long as it has MC5, Black Sabbath, the Who (I actually call them "The Why" now, for obvious reasons), Elvis and the Beatles on it! I shudder to think what would happen to me were I subjected to the other "hits" of that time for a long duration. Pat Boone, Paul Anka, Burt Bacharach, to name but a few could have serious negative effects on one's psyche!
