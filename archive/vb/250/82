Boy howdy, I know about that! Even my wife almost crashed into the rear of me
lil' ol truck. The tail lights are so dim she is always complaining that she
can't see them and wants me to drive behind her! I can imagine what other
people think. I work swing shift and drive home late so I spend half of my
driving time daily in the dark. Of course, I'm in the dark most of the time
anyway....

Holly Crap!

Boy I'm always afraid of something like this when I drive at night.  In
fact I wired two bug reverse lights to a dash switch just so I could
manually flash people racing up behind me.  Illigal...yes, but if it
gets their attention its worth it!!!
