Naw, tonuge-in-cheek humor recognized but, like the rest of my VW influenced
personality I enjoy everything from Kathleen Battle at Carnagie Hall to Rob
Zombie's American Made music and most everything in between. I would hate to
have to listen to only one artist, one genre or drive only one marque of
vehicle for the rest of my life. Mozart to Muddy Water, Shubert to Kenny Wayne
Shepard I say crank it up!
