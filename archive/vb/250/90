fellow type 2ers-

i have a 56 type 2 that is going to need some work to make it original again, i was wondering if someone had a 56 that was willing to take some refernce pictures, and measurements for me to assist in making things right. ( ie need picture reference of where the tailights are suppose to be, i have had larger ones grafted into place...)

thanks in advance
robert
