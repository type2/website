If you added LED brake lights along with the stock lights, or used the
complete LED tail light assembly off a new car, this could work well.

You can get LED lamps that have incandescent bulb bases, but these
usually aren't real great.  They tend to only throw light in one
direction.  Also, incadescent bulbs put out lots of colors of light, so
after the lenses throw most of it away there's still plenty of light.
LEDs put out a very narrow spectrum, so if your taillight lens isn't
a good match for the LEDs, you can end up with very little light.  A
clear tail light lens can help, but you still have the problem that
the LEDs are too directional.  Quite often the tail lights on riced-out
Civics will be a small blob of color in the middle of a clear lens,
instead of a nice large area of light.

Some of the hot-rod places have LED lamp assemblies for sale now, but
some of them are kind of spendy.  You can also find LED trailer lights
now if you look around.  99.99% of them are designed for 12 V, though.
Each individual LED is about a 2.5 V bulb, so they get run in several
strings of 4 or 5 for 12 V.  There's no technical reason why you couldn't
make a lamp with several strings of 2 or 3 for 6 V, but I don't think
there are many made that way.

If you put lights in the rear window, it helps to make a "shade" around
them so all the light goes out the back instead of reflecting at you.
Even some black cardboard taped around the edge can work.  Look at the
3rd brake light in older American cars for what I mean - the lamp housing
has a black plastic ring or hood around it to direct all the light out
the back.

For temporary use, magnets attached to the lamp housings can work well.
Some car parts stores sell the "tow truck" lights - two red lights on
magnet bases, with a 20' cord and a trailer plug.

You might leave the lens off, as a brighter bulb may melt it.  The stock
bulb for this was 10 W.  You can't do any better than this with the 3/4"
diameter bulbs, but in the 1" diameter bulbs, you can go all the way up
to 17 W (1129) in 6 V and 29 W (2396) in 12 V.  Other stops for 12 V
include 18 W (1141), 23 W (1073), and 27 W (1156).  There is a 38 W 12 V
bulb (1295) but it may be hard to find.

Somebody on the list (E&B?) mentioned having an illuminated license plate
frame wired as a third brake light, or of adding a couple of small trailer
lights at the license plate bracket, to increase rear visibility.
