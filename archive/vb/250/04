Subject: Fwd:Accident lawyers needed

This is a forward from Dawn to the Vintagebus and Type 2 lists.
As noted yesterday on the list, she, Richard and others survived a massive 
accident with an 18 wheeler.

Any help they can get in locating a good lawyer is what she is looking for.

Send any contacts to Dawn at mailto:dawn(-at-)plfvw.com
