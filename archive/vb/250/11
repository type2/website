Subject: can anyone in CT helicoil ? 

Hi, I have an exaust leak at one of my headers on my 85' Vanagon 1.9 L. Found that it was a gasket, went to replace the gasket, found one of the bolt holes is stripped (so bad a longer bolt won't even catch any threads) , and that it has already been tapped and dyed once, so this means it needs to be helicoiled. Does anyone in CT know how to do this and if so could you help me out?
thanx a bunch,
Tracy
