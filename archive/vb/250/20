Go to a few pawn shops and get you a classic Snap on Timing Light with
the clip for the #1 plug wire.
No fu-fu nothing to break. Those inductive pickups break the first time
you drop them.
I got mine for $30.00 and I had bought one back in the 60s just like it
for $100.00.

 do you guys have any recommendations on what to look for, or specific
manufacturers?
