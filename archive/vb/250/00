I was using Hagerty for my '60 DD for a year.  $92/year.  Never
had to file a claim, so I have no clue as to how 'good' they are.

Any of the classic car insurance companies will impose restrictions
of some sort on what you can do with your car.  Hagerty seemed to be
more liberal than others.  As an example, a certain insurer that's
big with the classic Porsche crowd will only insure you if you own
your own house, you have to have a locked garage, can only take the
car out when the moon is in Uranus, etc, etc.  

Hagerty does require that you have another car as a daily driver.
