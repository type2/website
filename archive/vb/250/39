Hi Joe,
You might want to just take some late model bug or bus arms with the hook 
ends and cut/weld them to the length you need and that way you can use 
inexpensive bug wiper blades.  Otherwise if your bus arm bases are in good shape you can 
cut off the later arms and grind/file them to fit the early bus wiper arm 
bases.
