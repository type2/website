several years ago, I bought my 63 DC for my then 16 yr old son as a
father/son bonding experiment. After we picked it up in Oregon and had 2
engine fires in the first 250 miles, we trailered it home the last 500 miles
& started to make it road worthy. Living in snow country at 4500 feet elev.
made the bus slow, cold, & hot in the summer. Soon the impatience of a
teenager w/ a lot of peer pressure from kids driving newer-fancier cars made
him want a BMW. We relented & bought him a 86 525E sedan w/ 175,000 miles on
it for next to nothing. Within a year a pretty cherry beemer had been
totaled twice by insurance cos. after he got whacked in the rear by a Toyota
Corolla, hit a deer, got hit while it was parked, etc. In all cases the
damage was minor to his vehicle, extensive to the hitters. But the repair in
all cases was more than the car value, so we pocketed the $$$ & continued to
drive the car. He is still driving it today w/ well over 200 K on it, & I
shudder to think of what shape he would be in if he had had those accidents
in the DC.

FWIW.

Tom Buese-drove a DC 1500+ miles last weekend, but not unhappy his kids
didn't
