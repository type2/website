Subject: Spring plate covers, spring plate bushes and thanks

I have removed my springplate covers and wish to tidy them up, would it be
okay for me to get the rears of them sandblasted, and then for me to spray
them totally with POR15.  There looks to be paint left where the bushes go -
therefore I cannot see any problem with doing this, but I thought I would
just check.
I think I am going to replace the bushes - I believe I can still get German
bushes in the UK for these, any tips on installing them?

My friend Jake sends his thanks for the advice about the tap stuck in his
chassis rail, he is going to the engineering suppliers today to see if they
can get him a tap remover.  
On Sunday we removed his engine and gearbox as he is restoring his bus and
its the engine bays turn for work.  He had driven it about 1000miles since
he bought it, but had been having trouble changing gear and eventually the
coupling broke.  I took a peak underneath and diagnosed the cause as being
the broken front gearbox mount causing the shift rod to take the weight.
When I undid the bolts for the gearbox cradle, it fell off.  The person who
replaced the mounts forgot to bolt them to the gearbox.  Therefore he had
been driving around with the axles and shift rod taking all the weight of
the engine and gearbox!!!!   This bus had been laid up in a barn for 16yrs
before being pulled out in 2001 - I was amazed by how much dust and crud was
sitting on top of the gearbox!
