Subject: Dropped Spindles

Hi All,

I am looking for a set of dropped spindles for my '67
bus.  I am aware of the guy in Oregon that will alter
my spindles for a price but I would like to keep my
spindles in case I ever want to go back to stock
height.  Does anyone know of a really good deal on a
set?

Thanks,

Gene
