If your relay is flopping around loose, that could be part of the problem.

No, It's tight but it is the orginal one. 


Is the 12 V flasher a VW part or a generic? What are the numbers on
its terminals? Some flashers can be hooked up more than one way and
still kind of work. If your flasher is right, and the hazard switch
is working, then at least your rear bulbs should flash when you pull
out the hazard switch.

  It is a VW. I think it's from a bus (211 part no) and the terminals are ( I think?) 49, 49+ and 31. The rear lights go on but do not flash when the switch is pulled.

Thanks again for your help. I have your email at home but I hadn't gotten that far yet. I start testing that stuff soon, after I finish getting the front end together of course!
