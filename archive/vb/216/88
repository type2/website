I'm still in the process of rebuilding my motor. I joined the list when I started the rebuild and
you all helped me a lot with some newbie-type questions. Thanks.

Another question I have is how you can tell if you have these *new and improved* DP heads that don't
crack and have the long reach plug hole. It looks like my heads on my motor are pretty new and I'm
hoping they are the improved variety.

I talked to J.C. Whitney rep this afternoon and they say that the supplier
they get there new SP and DP heads says that they have 11,000 pairs of SP
heads. He refused to tell me the name of the supplier though. And George is
right, all of the new Mexican and Brazilian 041 DP heads ARE thicker and have
a longer reach plug hole. I measured one of my new ones to one of the old
heads on the shelf ready to goto rebuild.

With all of the rebuilds out there, I doubt that the SP head will go away
anytime soon. I still have a fresh set of 373's on the shelf along with three
sets of rebuilds.
