El Viajero,
	Your bus sounds like it is very old, but proud.  It does not want 
to reveal its age to you.  I suspect that it is like an angry clam who 
will not open up.  Still, you need to wonder about the pearl inside.  
These old VWs are very mysterious. Be careful because some are evil and 
will eat your wallet.  These old clams almost seem to have teeth!
