Subject: Re: [VB] 1966 van advice UPDATE

Unfortunately someone bought it out from under me. 
------------------ Clip --------------------
I bought a 66 right out from under a guy back in November of last year.
Everytime I get the grease out from under my fingernails it breaks down
again.
Hello! Are you out there?
I made a mistake; You should have gotten this wonderful 66 Bus.
