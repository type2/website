Subject: 1966 van advice UPDATE

Thank you to everyone for yuor advice on the 1966 I was looking at. 
Unfortunately someone bought it out from under me. This is the second 
time this has happened and it makes me wonder if I will ever get a 
vintage van. This did however lead me to a 63 deluxe which I am now 
waiting for the snow melt off so I can look at it. The local owner of a 
Volkswagen resore show has offered to help me in my delema of finding a 
vintage van. He has connections all over western Canada and should be a 
great link not only that he knows a ton about vintage volkswagen 
vehicles. Again thank you all

Mike( Canada)
