i just wanted to say how cool it was of the veewees and clara to give 
that person ALL of the info they did, REGARDLESS of whether it turned 
out to be a leg-pull (notice he vanished when the jig was up).

they took the time to help a supposed newcomer to our community, and 
i hope they don't get once-bitten....    someone should ping the el 
vomito addy and see who it really was, and then egg his newly-painted 
63!!
