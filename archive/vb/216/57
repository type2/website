Slammed to me is anything lower than 3.5".
-------------------- OK---------------------
I've seen several lowered Splitties around town.
They normally run lowered suspension, Empi wheels and low profile tires.
They get quite a bit of attention at red lights and VW repair depots.
Never seen one running on the highway.
I wouldn't mind dropping mine about 2" inches but it is a long range
plan.
I admit it would look better dropped a few inches but I doubt the
215x1475r tires would run with it lowered in the rear.
