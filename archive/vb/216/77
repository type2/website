John,

According to the problems my good friends at Vintage Parts are having with
VWOA, via some slutty collection agency, a line drawing is VW property -
yup! Vintage has had a hand-drawn logo consisting of a bug and a bus, for
over 20 years, and they've been ordered to stop using it, and pay
back-charges! I told them to keep using it, and to he** with VW. So be on
alert.
