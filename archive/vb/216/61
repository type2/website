Subject: Re: [VB] RE: The Travelin' Fu's....LISTEES and the LIST

I couldn't agree more. I have only been on the list for a few years but I too have met some really great people, including Ricky. The list is especially nice for me because I usually travel solo to shows due to my fiancee's  work schedule and  it makes it easier to find someone who will be there. Last year at BYOB I met Karl, Harry, Todd and Gene; all of whom provided  great conversation not mention a beer or two and a delicious cigar. It turned out they were an "The List" too. Who wouldda thunk it?! Anyway, it would be nice if we had a way to recognize listee's at shows and events though. That way they could either say hello or keep me FAR away! :)
