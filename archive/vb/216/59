Hi Gene,
From what we have gleaned from our literature the bus about 1958 came with 
only one exterior mirror on the driver side to the USA as a standard item.  
While in shipping the arm would be loosly bolted in place and swiveled near 
the body while the small round mirror head would be stored in a box in the 
interior with other stuff for each bus.
