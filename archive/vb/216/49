Subject: [VB] new bus questions

Check out www.vintagebus.com to get all the chasis info you need.  The VIN 
should be in the rear between the battery and engine and behind the 
passenger seat back.

Slammed busses are very diffilult to build and do right.  Just as words of 
warning the work involved is high and so are the costs.  Granted there are a 
few running around so it is definately doable.  I think Franklin's VW Werks 
does a bunch and has a good webpage, so check that to see what is involved 
(scary).

My words of wisdom are do small things that are reversable if you ever want 
to bring it back to stock.  These old busses are rare these days.


Take Care,
Adrian
