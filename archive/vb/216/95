Subject: 4th gear found, but looks like tranny is shot

Well, after some more adjusting of the shift plate on the '65, I got 
the bus into 4th without grinding, but had to hold it there otherwise 
it slid up, and then came the familiar sound of something like an  air 
tool removing a lug nut at the tire shop.  No amount of adjusting would 
hold it in 4th, although it did stay there once for a few seconds on 
its own.  It still never seems as though it's fully in 4th, the way it 
does in the other gears though. I'm fearing the worst.

I took a gamble on this bus, and it looks like tonight, I lost.  Six 
months ago, I actually had 3 other running, driving cars that I would 
swap around based on the season.  In a row, they've all gone down hard 
due to old age factors.  This makes #4.  Time to prioritize, and maybe 
clean house.  But I've got to get one of them running.

With that said, about what $ would I be looking at for a quality 
rebuilt tranny, and maybe RGB's  for the 65? Any recommended vendors?  
Could I do most of the work myself?

Thanks all
Don
