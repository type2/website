Subject: Emergency Flasher/ Wirirng Q's

Hello,

So now I have a 12 volt flasher that works but my emergency lights are still messed up. All lights come on at the pull of the switch except for the passenger front, but none flash or pulse  at all.

Sooooooo... Does anyone have a emergency flasher for a '65 bus or know the replacemnt type? The diagram shows a 5 prong but mine is only a 4. There is no "85" on my old emegrency flasher.

 I found a 3 prong 12 volt flasher from a stash and hooked it up replacing my old 6 volt 3 prong flasher with no problems.

Light travels faster than sound. 
This is why some people appear bright until you hear them 
speak.
