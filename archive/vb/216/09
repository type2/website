Hello Everyone,

An update on my bus progress:  Still sanding...

Not much else to say.  It has been "getting there" for some time now, but 
hey, I'm doing this as a hobby, right?

On another note, I will be making a trip to Anaheim March 13-16 with my 
wife's family.  While they would be more than content to go to disneyland 
every day, shop at IKEA in the evenings and eat at chili's every night, I'd 
prefer to do a little bus sight seeing while there. I know it's not the best 
weekend to be there, no shows, I'm just trying to make the best out of a 
trip with the in-laws, if you know what I mean.

I've already got Transporter Garden in huntington on my list, what other 
type 2 places/activities should I look into while in Orange county?

Thanks!
