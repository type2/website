Hey sam
theres a pic of it in the parts manual online.

although i dont see a part number called out like the one you have.  Same part number but no letter
designation at the end. For a long time i thought it might be mcode 195 (although i found out
differently).

I keep seeing those mirrors everywhere but have been unable to find out anything about them. Dawn of
PLF has them on one of her buses, and someone recently posted to the list showing a bus he bought,
it had those too.
