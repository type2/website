Greetings,
Congrats on your new to you bus!  For the chassi number location check out 
the archives and enter "Chassi number" and you will get several pages of info 
to access or try:
<A HREF="http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/000372.html">http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/000372.html</A>
which is a past Email we posted now in the archives.
  Once you have the chassi number go to the type2 library and click on the 
"Identification" in the catagories.  Then scroll down to "Model/VIN 
Information" and under this is an article on "VIN Decoding and Changes" by 
the great late Josh Rodgers.
  The Archives are a great place to first check for info and the Library is a 
must to read through as you go through you bus.  Also buy the Bentley reprint 
of the 1963-67 VW Manual VW Transporter, it is worth every cent!
  Make sure to completely go through the brakes, steering and suspension 
before installing the engine and just driving it.  We have known too many 
instances where volks have not done the needed maintenance.  They loose a 
wheel, brakes or suddenly loose steering and at best end up having to fix and 
repair not only what was wrong, but suddenly the damage done to thier bus or 
worse they have to recover in the hospital or get buried/cremated.  In the 
end it costs far more to the bus owner and/or family in time, and $$$ to pick 
up the pieces than it would have cost if done the right way to first time.
  As for changing the bus drasticly from stock we highly suggest just getting 
it running and drive it for a year or so till you have the mechanical 
experience and knowing you are doing it the right way after doing the 
research and asking questions on this list first.
