Hi Cal,
Our 1966 printed "Accessories Catalogue"of "Accessories Domestic Line-VWoA, 
Inc., Riviera Motors, Inc." shows the Elephant Ear, Trucker and Harp style 
mirrors in it as accessories.  Also shows the Bendix tach, the diamond plate 
steel bumpers & tilt out side step, highroof accessory package tray over the 
sunvisors, wood slats kits for the all steel bus racks, by-pass oil-filter 
and lists an electronic engine lid lock they used to sell, among many other 
wierd/normal, unknown/unseen and well known accessory items!
