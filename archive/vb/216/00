 I've had good luck with used mystery motors. If it ain't broke don't fix it. 
  Just change the oil, adjust the valves/ tune it up, replace the main and 
oil cooler seals.   After the engine is in.  Check the oil frequently (every 
day) at first, and if it gets dirty prematurely change it, even if it's just 
40 miles.  (I put a sticky note on the dash, "oil change due xxxxx miles) In 
any case do a valve adjust/ oil change at 200 miles.  And just put put around 
town, babying the motor like a break in on a new one,  until the oil stays 
clean.  There can be a lot of old gurk in the case that gets into the oil, 
and it helps to flush that out with oil changes for a bit.

Enjoy!!!
