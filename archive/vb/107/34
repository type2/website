Subject: RE: [VB] Axle tube in RGB box question

I need to deepen, enlarge and re-tap the mount bolt holes (one is hammered).
Sure seems easier if I separate the RGB from the tube.

BTW any one have experience re-tapping the holes on the RGB?  What size to
go to, how deep to go?

I looked at this once on my '65 crewcab with a big stub rear axel. I "think"
it is a press fit, which means you would need a press to remove it. Why do
you want to separate it?
