Subject: Re: [VB] RATS!

Plenty of sympathy from here. Sounds familier. I suspect 
my 23 year old of scheming to get my '65 21 Window by 
removing the cars in the way. Machiavellian if you ask 
me, and it's still under resto! He's a step behind your 
son... shedding rice-burners to get my '71 Bug.  You 
should worry if he's able to sabotage a Buick and kill a 
Bug! Don't let him near your food and drink unattended!
