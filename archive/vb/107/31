If your into a bit of electronics,, you can wire a relay into a 555 timer
circuit, and make it adjustable time
I think it is called an off delay timer relay

momentary key "on" energizes the timer to hold the relay "on" for a time
period,, like 30 minutes for example,, and if you fall asleep or leave the car
,, it will time out and shut off the radio,, If your still listening to the
radio when it shuts off,, just flick the key on for a second, then off again, to
reset the timer for another 30 minutes.....
it will stay on all the time the key is "on" for driving pleasure,
