Subject: Front nose skin

Hello all-

I am looking for a bus front nose. I do not need the
windshield frames, only from the dash down. Year and
paint is unimportant as long as it is a split. I am
looking for an INEXPENSIVE one that isn't perfect but
CHEAP and  decent. Let me know what you have, I live
in CA. 

Thanks, 

Sean Dorman
