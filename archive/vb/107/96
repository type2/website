Hey Brian,

I buy Oil Eater in the gallon from Costco and a scrub brush.  Works great and leaves the paint.  Sandblasting won't remove all of the greasy, muddy gunk.  If you need to sand blast, you need to clean the parts first.

What is the best way to clean off the gunk without screwing up the paint....   I'm not looking for a miracle/mystery product just a way to do it. What kind of degreaser? What method?
