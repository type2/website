Preface: Searched the archive w/o success.

Question: I (w/John Howard's serious help) recently rebuilt the windows
on my bus and am starting to have a problem with the vertical scrapers
poping out of the windows. Is there some sort of retention mechanism
that holds them in? The bottom is trapped between the glass and the
slider track thing, but the top has ??

Thanks in advance for any help. Let me know if I'm not be detailed
enough.
