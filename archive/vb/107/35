 It can be done, but you don't want to have the key in the first position
 without the engine running as you will burn points and/or overheat the
 coil.  VW's don't have an "accessory" position like most cars.

I asked my hand and he told me to connect the radio to a black wire, which is 
the auxillary wire that turns off with the key. If you are worried about 
welding points together, install a compufire electronic ignition, which does 
not have points. If you have an older 6-v system bus, switch to 12-v or just 
have your radio shut off with the key and forget about running the battery 
down on secondary power.
