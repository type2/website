Hi List,
I recently posted to the list about a bullet-riddled,
rusted out duluxe with a sliding rag top I had found
while on a road trip in NW Arkansas. I finally got the
pics developed and scanned. You can see them at
thesamba.com in the gallery under rusty buses or at
vintagebus.com under hall of shame. You can also try
these links:

I think you will all agree,"What a shame!!"

Thanks,
3DPete
p.s. Any ideas about what year model it might be?
