Subject: OOO, Body Filler!

I have finally started to think about beginning the "restoration" on my 66 Kombi. Anyway, the nose is full of body filler from where some dents were pulled out, then skimmed to smooth out. Over the last 20 or so years that this bus has been sitting outside, the body filler has apparently absorbed some water and the top coat of paint has peeled away, leaving the body filler right out there in the elements. The filler still seems to be smooth enough, and I am wondering if i can dry this stuff out under some heat lamps or something for a couple of weeks and then just sand it, prime it and paint it. OR should I go through the trouble of trying to remove all the old filler and then put new stuff on. Some considerations: I KNOW that it would be best to just replace the whole nose clip with good straight metal but I ain't gonna! Also, I am by no means doing a professional resto I just want to fix this bus up to the point where it is presentable and can be driven regularly. I will be !
painting it myself, and I would like the paint to last at least for a couple of years on this area. So what do y'all think, scrape out the old and re-fill? or Sand it, prime it, paint it, and drive it?!
