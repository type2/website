Actually, the way this happened is, the paint film failed in some way,
cracked, wore thin, etc, when this happened, moisture reached the filler. So
many people think that filler simply disintegrates beneath a good film of
paint and then causes the paint to fail.

I don't recommend this. The reason is, the moisture has probably penetrated
the filler and has reached the underlying metal. If it has, no amount of
drying will remove the oxidation from the metal. I suggest that you should
grind out all the old filler to bare metal and straighten the metal or
reapply the filler.
