Subject: More carb stuff  30-3 more fuel pump qs.

Well, got the carb to not soak engine. Still wont start after a run, Now
I am thinking what the list has been telling me, too damn lean. She only
idled for 10 minutes, was HOT. I need guage to test this stuff out but
dipstick was unpleasant, and she wouldn't start hot.
I am jetting up to 120+ as recommended with this cam. I will also
measure gas height in bowl to be certain I am low enough, doubt gas is
too low yet.
New plugs and rechecked dwell, it was at 55, I will work on that.
Seems like the too lean condition is my hot start problem, and possibly
a fuel perc problem now.
I really don't think fuel pump can be adding to any of this PITA, as
pressure was always less than 4. Is there any way regardless of pressure
this can be a problem?
