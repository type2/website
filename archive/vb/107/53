Hi,

EveryBus 2002 www.everybus.com starts Friday 4.19.02 (unofficially Thursday.)

It is getting down to the wire. My bus is mess and I am starting to stress :)

Several long distance additions to the carabus list. There are two 
from Florida and one more from Massachusetts!

Everything is in bloom in Greensboro so bring you camera and you Cloritin :)

FMBC is feeding everyone breakfast on Saturday. Check the web site for details.

The Canadian Contingent will be serving breakfast to ALL on Sunday. 
Do not ask then what the funny round meat is as you will get a 
lecture on bacon :) Be sure to ask about curling though, eh.

It suddenly became summer today. Looks like great weather for EB.

The park staff is ready for us and report good conditions at HST.

The folks from Cali are already on the road and a bunch more are 
leaving tomorrow.

I am getting punchy :)

There will not really be time to do any more web page updates or much 
else so I want to take the opportunity to wish you all a safe and 
happy trip to EB!!!!!!

Thanks
