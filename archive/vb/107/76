Several list members have called to get the "cheap " JC Bentley only 
to be turned off by their outrageous shipping and handling fee. 
Besides who said I was not going to wheel and deal on my prices :)

One of the cheapest prices for a new in the wrapper 63-67 Bentley is 
a t Bus Depot. Several sites such as amazon.com are selling it for 
$99.00

BTW, the NOS splash pans are already spoken for.

Thanks
