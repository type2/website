Go slow or get a bigger engine.  Also you can up the compression, but then
you have to keep it at elevation.  Also advance the timing.  I always try
and set my timing back (I run about 38 total) when I get down low.  I use
the engine idle speed as a guide.  When it starts idling faster, it's time
to set it back to the right speed.  Going from Albuquerque to Havasu it
starts out about 800-900rpm idle and goes to about 1500 in Havasu.  Should
be set back at Seligman, not Havasu.  Seems like the gas companies are
also allowed to drop a couple of octane points for gas used at higher
altitudes. Guess you don't need it if there isn't enough air to burn it.
