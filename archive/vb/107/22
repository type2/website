Subject: RE: [VB] Clutch Spring

That is the method I have been using and I'm afraid my neighbors will
petition for a gag order soon.  I have absolutely no control over my
mouth when I bust knuckles.  Thanks for letting me know I'm going about
it the right way.

Install clip, then use screw driver to get the the spring around arm.
Clip will often spring off, curse, repeat. I actually tied string to
take the force off the arm, by tying sring to arm and chassis. Filing
the clip slot a tad deeper (especially if it was zinced)helps. Good
luck, AL

I installed a new clutch lever and now I'm trying to get the spring back
on.  Is there a trick to this because so far this task has been a pain
in the arse.  TIA!
