Subject: RE: [VB] Clutch Spring

Install clip, then use screw driver to get the the spring around arm.
Clip will often spring off, curse, repeat.
I actually tied string to take the force off the arm, by tying sring to
arm and chassis.
Filing the clip slot a tad deeper (especially if it was zinced)helps.
Good luck,
AL

I installed a new clutch lever and now I'm trying to get the spring back
on.  Is there a trick to this because so far this task has been a pain
in the arse.  TIA!
