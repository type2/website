Subject: Re: [VB] valve adjustment changes

Hi John,
If it is loosening then it is possible to be the head loosening, and/or the 
cam lobe and/or lifter wearing.  If a valve is stretching and getting ready to 
break the valve setting most likely will tighten between adjustments as the 
valve becomes longer.
