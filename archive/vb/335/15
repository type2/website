Subject: Excessively stiff clutch pedal

I have a 66 split bus that I fitted IRS to 18 months ago using a type 3 box -
of the post 72 style.

It had its original box, but with a 1200 engine in with a 180mm clutch - which
I don't remember being that difficult to use.

When I fitted the IRS box I cleaned the tube running along the bus with an old
cable attached to a drill as someone on here recomended I did and got a new
Bowden cable.  I did the same to a friends bus using exactly the same new
parts and his is easy to depress,

I then fitted a 1600 that had sat outside for a while, and the pressure plate
was a bit rusty - the clutch was tough to engage - but I just put that down to
the fact that then PP was rusty.

Now I have just fitted a type 4 engine with a brand new 215mm pressure plate -
and the clutch is still just as difficult to engage.....

I have recently tested  of my friends buses whilst we were away, one is on the
original box and the other has a super beetle IRS box, from around 71/72. Both
of these were really easy to engage, maybe even requiring less than half the
effort of mine.

What could cause this? I have to pull the engine to change the flywheel oil
seal so I want to investigate this further and solve it.

When I press the pedal without the engine fitted its really easy to press the
pedal - so its not the return spring.

One thing I do remember from when I had the pedals out before was that
something looked non-original about the tab that the clutch cable attaches to
- but I can't remember what it was about it. Perhaps it had broken and had
been welded on - but I think that would make it easier to use.

Anyone got any ideas?

Thanks a lot
Paul
