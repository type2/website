Subject: Re: [VB] Excessively stiff clutch pedal

Paul,
We can defiantly tell the 1700lb clutch over stock, and another vw 
friend has stopped using the 1700 lb because he was braking a clutch 
every year or less.
Stock clutch is like butter and 1700lb you know you are pushing.
Hope this helps
P & C
