Subject: Toronto Buses & Beaches Picnic - Thursday Evening, August 26th,

Hi Volks,

Since it''s mid August I would like to repeat a popular Toronto-area 
bus gathering, the Buses & Beaches Picnic.

Not a campout, just a picnic. On a weeknight. Last year we had a 
"pot-luck" shish-kabob theme, and it seemed to work quite well, so I'd 
like to repeat that again this year. Think of it as Breakfast Burritos, 
but at dinner time. I will bring a large BBQ, and will have the 
westrailer along as well. Bring your own beverages, dishes, etc.

When: Next Thursday evening. Get there ASAP after work, I'll probably 
arrive close to 5:30/6PM.

Where: Cherry Beach is right at the bottom of Cherry St, in the Toronto 
Portlands. This beach has the cleanest shores of all the beaches in 
Toronto, and is currently posted as being quite safe to swim in. What 
you do with that information is up to you, but if my kids want to play 
in the water I am going to let them.

See you at the beach!
