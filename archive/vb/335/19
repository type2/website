Subject: Re: [VB] Excessively stiff clutch pedal

Hi Paul,
You need to check the parts of the clutch that the cable attaches to and 
compare these to a bus that is acting normally.  Also check which clutch cable arm 
you have on the tranny.  The later trannies have two lengths of these arms.  
The later one being longer for less pedal effort.  
If you change the rear arm you have to change the mount for the rear of the 
boden tube to keep it aimed at the arm or have clutch cables last about 6,000 
miles instead of 30,000+.  BTDT!  Fortunitly this is easier for your later 
tranny because it is an easy bolt off/on item, where the earlier setup one has to 
replace the entire tranny side plate.
