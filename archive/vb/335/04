Hi Clara,
Yes, we have done the 6 volt on the later 1600 with no problems.  You just 
have to get the right combo of parts.  Yes, the 40 HP through 1600 cranks are 
the same length.
  Get rid of the earlier small diameter heater boxes when running an engine 
larger than a 1300.  Cut and weld up the later large diameter heater boxes to 
fit the smaller diameter heat system.  The earlier small diameter heater boxes 
have a smaller tubing inside and less surface area inside to exchange heat.  
So during the winter the heaters are less effective and during the summer these 
cause more exhaust back pressure causing in turn the engine to run hotter oil 
temps.
