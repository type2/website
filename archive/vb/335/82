Subject: RE: [VB] screws for windows of my 60

As always, you should go to vintagebus.com and search through the on
line parts catalogs.  I downloaded them to my hard drive for the
occasion when I'm not on the internet.  Or, better yet, buy a copy of
the parts manual or even one of the photo copies that are available.

However, I'm sure if you call up WW and ask for the screws they will
know exactly what you need.


Good luck

David

So ... I need screws for my pop-outs - the screws that hold the frames
together - the ones that hold the frame to the body and the ones that
hold the
latch to the frame and to the body.

I also need the screws that go in the door windows ... the little ones
that
hold the bend piece that the latch catches on to the horizontal part of
the
frame.

A while back someone suggested wolfsburgwest - but I can't seem to load
there
pages ... anyone know exactly the sizes that I need.  Who elses has
these?
