Subject: screws for windows of my 60

So ... I need screws for my pop-outs - the screws that hold the frames
together - the ones that hold the frame to the body and the ones that hold the
latch to the frame and to the body.

I also need the screws that go in the door windows ... the little ones that
hold the bend piece that the latch catches on to the horizontal part of the
frame.

A while back someone suggested wolfsburgwest - but I can't seem to load there
pages ... anyone know exactly the sizes that I need.  Who elses has these?

TIA
