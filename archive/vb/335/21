Subject: Re: [VB] Excessively stiff clutch pedal

"stock" is vague... does it have the circles or lots of thin arms? 

I'd think about your bowden tube.  seem to remember the bend of thebowden 
tube affects the firmness of the clutch pedal.   it's in the bentley.

The first pressure plate I did not know the ID of as it came with the

even a 1700lb Kennedy shouldn't need a lot more effort as mine does compared
to friends buses?
