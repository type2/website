If everything is working as designed, the indicator light in the speedo
won't flash if one of the outside bulbs is burned out or is not drawing
enough current for some reason, like a bad connection.  The bad
connection can be a bad ground at the light, a bad connection of the hot
wire at the light, or a bad connection inside the turn signal switch.

For bad connections at the lights, mostly you just have to take the
lenses off and the bulb out and make sure the socket is not crudded up,
the reflector is solidly attached to the body, etc.

You can diagnose a bad connection at the turn signal switch if you have
a couple of wires with alligator clips on the ends.  At the nine-prong
box, unplug the black/white/green wire on 49a.  Use one clip lead to
jump the 49a terminal on the box to the VL terminal on the box, and
use another clip lead to jump the 49a terminal on the box to the 
black/yellow wire at the turn signal switch.  This should make your
left front and left rear turn signals blink, and also make the speedo
indicator work.  If the speedo indicator flashes dependably, you
probably have a bad connection in your turn signal switch.  If it
still flashes a few times and goes out, then you have bad connections
at the lights or trouble in the nine-prong box.

>Nine pin problem or turn signal relay??

The nine-prong box _is_ your turn signal (and hazard flasher) relay.
