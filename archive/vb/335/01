Kevin, no it won't fit as is.  You can modify it (without hurting the
towbar at all) to make it work by adding some additional material.  Look
at Michael Benthin's picture that I have posted on my page to see how it
is done.  I could not find sign post and I didn't want to steal any so I
used square tubing with holes in it (not sure the correct name for it).
I got the tubing from Menard's.  I got the axle bolts from Tractor
Supply but any place that has trailer axle "u" bolts should have them.

Michael's picture is at

My setup that I made is at http://mypage.iusb.edu/~kahlgrim/77bus/  I
have not used it on a split window and I use a different towbar but you
can get the basic idea.

You can also buy a towbar made for buses but I do not have any info on
them but I know they are out there.

Let me know if you have any questions,
Kevin
