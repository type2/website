so, if it is 6 volt, and my bus is 12 volt, wont that
burn out the choke or something?? cuz it doesnt work.
i wish i had the money for a new or rebuilt carb. i
guess ill have to just make do for now. yeah, it leaks
a bit. it used to have a vacume leak between it and
the manifold, but i fixed that. ill probably end up
using this carb as a paper weight or something, as im
sure it doesnt have much life left in it.
