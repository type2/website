Hi all,

Well, we're a few short weeks away from another gathering of the Busses (and
any VW other model) for the anual VW Campout on Mark Twain Lake near Hannibal,
Missouri.  We're looking forward to seeing our old, as well as new VW friends
around the campfire.  If you'd like to join us for the festivities, go to
http://www.bnnta.com for more info and directions.  Door prize donations are
starting to pile up, and if you have anything you'd like to contribute to the
give-away on Saturday evening after the award presentation, we'd love to pass
it along to the BNNTA attendees.  So pack up your Bus, drive safely and
prepare to join the madness at BNNTA!

See you soon!
