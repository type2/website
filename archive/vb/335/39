Subject: re:more 6V conversion...used motor

Was asked:
"(funny thing is with fan belt off it didn't rub, but with belt on it did
... go figure)"

I'd imagine this is related to the generator bearings...if they are worn
out-I think you will get the symptom you are describing...better to replace
bearing with engine out-because you need to remove engine to replace
bearings, and if the bearings go-BTDT, it kind of sucks trying to find a 6V
generator.

AS for blowing smoke at start up-if the engine is sitting for a long time I
think that oil would work its way past the rings, and into combustion
chamber-then burn and smoke away...or you also mentioned that the oil level
was pretty high-the extra oil could also burn off.

Just some suggestions....good luck...
