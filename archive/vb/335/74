Hi Josh,
When you move the throttle shaft around is it snug in its bore or sloppy?  
When do you notice the fuel drippage?  When the engine is running or just after 
shutting it off?

You can easily run an engine without a choke by constantly lightly nudging 
the gas pedal when in nuetral to keep the mixture richer and the engine running 
till the engine get up to temp when driving.  Though in heavy traffic or an 
area with lots of stop signs this can be more of pain.
i think it has a place for the fuel cut off switch, but im not sure. 
It will have a place for the fuel cut off solinoid, it is the same place the 
plain pilot (idle) jet goes when you do not have a soliniod fuel shut off 
switch in place.  Take a look at Ray's carb website for what a fuel shut off 
solinoid looks like.
  Are you running a Solex carb and what model are you running?
