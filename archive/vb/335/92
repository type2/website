Subject: "funny" little engine noise

The same thing happened to me. I took my motor to the machine shop and had
the crankshaft and a new flywheel drilled to 8 dowel pattern for oversized
dowels. Engine is still doing well.

> My plan at this point is to replace the flywheel and crankshaft.
Everything
else is almost new.

> Wishing I could just build an engine that would last 50,000 miles.

> Any opinions, reactions, or advice is requested.
