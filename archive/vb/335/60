Hi Josh,
If it was rebuilt and ran fine till now, then it probably just needs a good 
cleaning again.  It is not unusual when we rebuild a carb to have to clean it 
once or even twice again soon after.  This is probably because the crud in the 
carb that does not come out with the first cleaning will loosen up during 
running and clog up a jet.
