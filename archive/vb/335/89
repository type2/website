Carburetor shop.  A city of reasonable size (1 million or so in the
metro area) should have at least one.  Look in the Yellow Pages under
"carburetor" or possibly under "auto parts and supplies".

>and about how much should it cost?

I paid about $40, which was maybe a little much, in the spring of 2002.
