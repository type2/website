Subject: jerome questions

believe it or not, i may have talked my relatives into a jerome trip this year!
my son's birthday is the 11th, and his grandparents are going to be 
in town for it;  the plan would be for me to drive up friday (look 
for a ratty green fat chick broken down by side of road to jerome, 
with "for sale - one aluminum motor" painted on the side :P ), and my 
wife and relatives to drive up to jerome saturday.
i'm assuming the town can keep them busy most of the day, but is 
there somewhere recommended for them to stay saturday night?
