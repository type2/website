If you are idleing at around 2lbs then I I don't think you got your gage
problem solved or your main bearings are loos as a goose! I start
worrying when I see idle pressure less than 10 lbs. read from the "T" at
the oil pressure switch which is at the top of the oil pump output.

I got a replacement oil pressure gauge from Ray ay  Volkauthority and
now the
reads correctly.
Will get better pics on the way to work this morning, but it  goes up to
50
psi when revved and idles just above zero, or at least it did when  I
installed
it 2 hours after driving home last night.
