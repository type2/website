Subject: Turn Signal Switch

Hello Busfreaks :),

Just wondering if any of you have a turn signal switch
for sale for a '65 bus.  It has been converted to
12volt but I'm not sure if that matters.  I'm in
Seattle (Yes I've called Ken and he dosen't have any
right now) but I'm willing to pay shipping.

Thanks!

Kurt
