Subject: Re: [VB] Excessively stiff clutch pedal

  You need to check the parts of the clutch that the cable attaches to and
  compare these to a bus that is acting normally.  Also check which clutch
cable arm
  you have on the tranny.  The later trannies have two lengths of these arms.
  The later one being longer for less pedal effort.

I definately have the shorter type - I don't think there is enough room for
the longer ones underneath the petrol tank support shelf though?

I'll have to investigate those other buses then

Thanks
