Taking a set in the valve seat if it's a new head, or a pulled head
stud(s). Possibly a stretching bad exhaust valve that is ready to break
off.

Subject: [VB] valve adjustment changes


After adjusting the valves about 75 miles ago I find
that no. 3 cylinder exhaust valve is too loose again.
I don't know whether I miss adjusted the valve or
what,  but I readjusted it and it seems to be holding
now.  My question is what would be the cause of a
valve loosening repeatedly after adjusting it?  I am
keeping a log of all the valve adjustment changes but
I'm not sure how to read this data.  Thanks for the
help.
