Subject: Turn signal indicator problem...

Thought I had this fixed a couple of months ago but it has flared up again
in a minor way. Turn signals left/right and hazards all work but the turn
signal indicator light in the speedo will flash a couple of times and then
go out. Nine pin problem or turn signal relay??

Thanks for any help provided.
