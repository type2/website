Subject: Dixie Bus Gathering and Ohio Vintage Show Pics

Hi Volks,

I have posted the pics from our post-BOTC Family Vacation lsat week. We 
started out camping at Lake Erie State Park in Brocton N.Y. and then 
proceeded down to Frank Biffath's Dixie Bus Gathering near Mt. Vernon 
Ohio. During DBG I also attended the Central Ohio Volksfest vintage VW 
show, and there are lots of pics from that as well.

Enjoy:

Happy trails,
