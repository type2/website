Subject: No bus content, but maybe someone can help me.

Hi,

 

Sorry for the no bus content, but I've been visiting the US the last 3
weeks.

During these 3 weeks I've seen wonderful places (Grand Canyon, Monument
Valley, Bryce, Zion, Death Valley, Yosemite, San Francisco, LA, .), but one
day I got a parking ticket.

Stayed to long at the beach wile parked in a 2hr zone.

I called the 1-800 number and there I heard that I could pay by visa on the
internet.

Now my problem : I've written the internet address down, but must have made
a mistake .

So now I can't pay the parking ticket.

 

Does anyone know the www address to pay the ticket or can someone call the
number 1-800-654-PARK and send the address to me please ?

 

Thanks,

Gunther (Europe)
