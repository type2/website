Subject: horn screw

Well after taking my '65 bus out the other day, I realized the horn does not
work. It turns out the little tiny screw that is supposed to hold the ground
wire to the underside of the horn is MIA.

 

This screw was tiny, and brass. I have not been to my local hardware store,
but I am sure they don't have something this odd size/material/in metric.

 

Anyone have ideas on where to get one, or have an idea of what the size is
so I can try to order from a screw company?

 

Thanks.
