Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch pedal spring

The spring is just at the very back, at the tranny

Barndoors had grease fittings for clutch and brake pedals.
My 61 has a grease fitting for one of them, but I think the late 50s buses did
not.


If yours is sticky at the pedal area, you might consider taking it apart, to
clean it up, grease it and reinstall it.
They do tend to get crusty under there.
You might do the brake pdeal lever too.
not fun.   But it will work nicer afterwards.
most buses need this done, FWIW.

The grease fitting you reach through the floor is for the forward end of the
drag link.   You have to turn the steering wheel for the zerk to line up with
the access hole.  They dropped this hole when they dropped the grease fittings
on the draglink and tie rods, so you won't find it on a late split.
