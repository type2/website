Subject: RE: [VB] horn screw

That is a big help...next question-as mcmaster only has these in steel. I
believe it should be brass-as the original is brass. I worry about steel
being too strong, and possibly causing damage or rusting in place...Am I
correct-it should be brass?

I found one local supplier can get me Stainless Steel, min order 10 for
~$10, or another supplier min order 100 in brass for $25.

I'm leaning towards getting it in brass...but wanted to make sure my
thinking on material choice is correct.

I think it's M2.5 x 0.45, and 5mm in length- not positive on the pitch
as I don't have a metric thread gauge but I've only found 0.45 listed
for 2.5mm.  McMaster-Carr is usually pretty good for stuff like this.

Good Luck!
