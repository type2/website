Subject: Fwd: Circle the Wagen

There's been a bunch of discussion on the WetWesties list about the  
movie Circle the Wagen.

<http://www.circlethewagen.com/>

So I wrote the production team.... <see below:>

Can anyone help out? I know that there was a site in South Africa that  
had a bunch of commercials on it. Does anyone happen to have the URL?   
Does anyone have any film? I have a couple old Castrol films from the  
60s, but nothing VW.

This is about all our friends!

WetWesties would REALLY like to screen this at one of our gatherings.  
Any chance of a DVD being available? Any chance you could come spend a  
weekend camping with us and share it? We'd supply the projector, the  
screen, the food and the beer!

This is really good. The extended trailer captures the essence of what  
VW owners are all about.

Hi Jim,
	What a wonderful, encouraging email to get. And what a fantastic  
offer. I'm excited to say that we are in post-production right now &  
are on schedule to finish the film this year w/ an early 2012  
premiere. And here's a point of interest for you & the WetWesties;  
what we really need right now is vintage film stock. If any of your  
members have old films stock, high quality footage of VW commercials,  
factory footage, any of those great industrials VW put out in the 60's  
& 70's, that's really what we're looking for to finish the film. After  
we do that, I obviously can't say for certain, but personally  
speaking, I would love to hang for a weekend, meet the WetWesties  
family & screen our film. If you would, could you pass on that need to  
your members & see if anyone would let us borrow that footage. We  
would, of course, pay for shipping to & fro as well as include a  
digital copy of their footage upon return as we'd be digitizing it for  
our use.

	I'll keep your info & keep you posted.
Thanks much, Jim,
