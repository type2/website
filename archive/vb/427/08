Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Spitty question, leaky headlamp buckets.

Michael,

Thanks for the comments. I have what I believe to be OG chrome rings. The
chrome is certainly good quality as it has not shown any corrosion after 7
years. However there is definitely a gap between the rings and the rim of the
headlight buckets.  I may just resort to using some sealant. Any suggestions
for something that would not be to permanent?

Chris
