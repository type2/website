Hi John,
	Probably the carb? My '74 super began to run poorly after redoing  
the clutch and front seal. It ran great before this work. I took the  
carb apart and did a casual clean and that made no difference. After  
checking everything else I went back to the carb and did a careful  
rebuilt. It now runs great again!
