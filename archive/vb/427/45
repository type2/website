Subject: RE: air scoops & mythbusters....

About 10 years ago while living in CA's hot central valley, I  
designed, built and tested my own scoops.  I made them from Aluminum  
and were made so that they did NOT have to be screwed into the body,  
but rather clamped-on.  Mine worked good and I saw real cooling  
increases with them in real-world testing in hot CA heat.

All the details are here:  http://www.aircooledtech.com/custom_scoops/  
  And yes, the logo was shamelessly used ;-)

Aesthetically, scoops are a personal thing for sure, but they can do  
your bus good on a hot day when made correctly.
