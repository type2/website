Also, worn out rear torsion bushings will do the same thing. Easy to replace 
the outer bushings. About a 20-30 minute job for both. Will make a world if 
difference if you have original bushings in your bus.

Hi Chris,



If your bus is wobbly in windy conditions, this can be caused by having the
wrong tires on your bus. Our buses need extra stiff sidewalls on their
tires. I don't know all the tech. info on them-but I had the wring tires put
on my '65 bus at one point, and realized years later they were the wrong
kind. It explained the wobble whenever passed by a semi.



If you search the list I'm sure you can learn a bit about the correct tires.
I believe Bus Depot carries them(I think a got 4 from them).
