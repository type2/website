New to  me. It prolly came out of a dune buggy used as a street car.
The guy just  wanted rid of it as he was cleaning up the woman's
basement, and knew I had  busses. I bought it as it is a universal
case. I was thinking I might get  lucky for a change, and have a runner
with a little work. Why would anyone  take the plugs out and leave it
that way? Looks like I will have to at  least tear it down that far.
Thanks.

I have at least 4 longblocks  sitting around. I figured they had no value.




hey Doc  I would put some marvel oil in there and rotate it around. .  if 
it turns good heck put some plugs in it and fire it up. might have to rebuild 
 or replace the carb and fuel lines but then you could check it out better. 
spare  parts or motors are a good thing to have,  later  mark  d
