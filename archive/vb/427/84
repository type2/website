Kevin,

Looks very much like what I did with my bus. Lots of Dynamat and then later 
Damplifier

FYI, Ant over at Second Skin would like to see what you are doing. About 
2-1/2 years ago he gave a kit of stuff to a guy who started a thread on the 
Samba, he got close to finishing and then never posted again. He had videos 
demonstrating the noise level etc..
