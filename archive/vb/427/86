Hi Chris,

 

Was writ:

Can you good folks tell me what the cost is for a project like this?

********************

I would check out Second Skin's website for current pricing. I bought this
last April, but due to the rest of my life and work, did not really start
installing until recently.

 

I bought 200 SF of damplifier. I covered all the ceiling and walls and floor
of the bus. I put two layers over the engine compartment area. This is
probably more than I will need, it looks like I have a lot left. Then again,
I will probably put more on the back of the panels I fabricate, and use more
on other VW's. 

 

I bought 10 sheets of luxury liner pro. This seems like just the right
amount-but is not enough if you want to put some on the floor of the main
cabin. If you want to put LL  here too, you may want another piece or two.
In other words 8 sheets covered the walls, and the ceiling. I think I have
enough scraps to put some on the nose too. I also did not put LL Pro under
the front seats, just damplifier. I thought the LL Pro would be too thick
and affect the look of the grey vinyl trim pieces that go here. 

 

I plan on laying the last two sheets of LL Pro over the engine compartment,
but not gluing down. I plan on installing some heavy duty rubber back carpet
here, and didn't want the spongy feeling of walking on this stuff. 

 

I ordered 3 cans of adhesive (he sent double(6 cans), I think because of my
large order, so I have 6 cans-way more than I need, but I can use it on my
next project). I only used 2 cans for 8 of the 10 sheets I installed. I
think I still have enough in the two cans if I want to adhere the last two
sheets, but I think I will leave them free.

 

I already had a J-bar roller, he threw in two wooden handle rollers-which
were handy for some spots.

 

If you have questions about actual coverage area, check my pics on the
samba, and if not clear let me know, and I can try to clarify with more
pics.

 

With a large order, you get a discount-I think 10-20% I cannot remember.

 

I hope that helps.
