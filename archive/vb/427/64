Subject: "Wandering" idle

Hey All,
My 34pict3 carb has developed an issue in which the idle speed "wanders" and will not stay steady.  It is especially pronounced when I rev up the engine then release the throttle. Once released the idle goes way down for a few seconds and almost dies only to regain momentum and pick up revs again.
So advice please.  I am assuming a carb issue but wil start by checking points, timing, etc. AFter that, where would you all suggest I begin.

PEACE! 
John Baker
