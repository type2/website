Subject: Spitty question, leaky headlamp buckets.

Howdy,

My headlight buckets leak when washing my bus resulting in condensation inside
and subsequent corrosion. Does anyone have a solution to the leaky gaskets
under the chrome rings? BTW, the fit on the driver side is much better than on
the passenger (right) side, thus less leakage on the driver (left) side. I've
seen this on several buses. Is the right side sheet metal and bucket not
formed as well as the driver side?

Thanks,
Chris
