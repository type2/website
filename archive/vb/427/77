Hi Steve,

 

I am replacing the door handles with R-profile door handles. I was just
wondering about the wiring between the ignition from the later bus getting
connected to the ignition on the older bus.

As far as keying the R profile ignition to match the L profile that the rest
of your bus uses, that's not going to work.  You can't change the profile of
the lock cylinder for all practical purposes.
