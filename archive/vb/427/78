Subject: Clutch pedal spring

Hi all,

Just wondering (Clara?) if my 57 bus is supposed to have a return spring 
on the clutch pedal lever ?  The level doesn't return all the way to the 
top of the travel so it's just the tranny lever spring and clutch spring 
pulling it back and maybe they aren't enough. I wondered if the cab end 
is also supposed to have a spring ?

cheers.

Lee
