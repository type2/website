Another thought.

Have you done a complete tune up? Plugs, wires, points, timing? Check the 
advance on your distributor?

Good question to be honest I don't know. I have a Bosch 009 with 
electromagnetic points... I am seriously considering getting an SVDA though 
as I hear they are much better for the engine. Thank you for the type2.com 
tip, I'll check it out.
