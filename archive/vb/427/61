Hey,
ya I did use the shiny bubble wrap insulation, on a different bus.
Actually, two different buses, neither of which I have anymore.
It made a big difference in keeping the warm in and the cold out, or in
summer, keeping the heat out.
I am definately going to use it on the kombi.  I just haven't got there yet.
:)

SST is the Shasta Snow Trip.   about 500 miles of back woods driving in
Northern Calfornia on super bowl weekend.
the '67 Riviera I insulated the roof in was there!
there were about 40 split buses this year.
  lots of fun, lots of choas, and maybe half a dozen broken front tranny
mounts.
