Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch pedal spring

Hi and thanks,

I had a look around for a grease nipple/zerk fitting as I was sure there 
was one on other buses I had, but I couldn't see it anywhere obvious in 
relation to the clutch level fulcrum point. Can you point me to where it 
is ?  I sprayed the fulcrum with WD-40, but I think I'll have to remove 
it and clear it up really to getting moving nice and freely.  This has 
happened since the winter storage so it's just lack of use.

Re: pedals staying on the floor - doh, yes of course - thanks.
