For roof insulation, I've used a hot water heater insulation kit. It  
is held up by thin wood slats spaced about 6" apart and running  
length wise. I use a fire resistant fabric tucked in over the kit's  
plastic cover which covers the inch or so fiberglass mat. This all  
can easily be removed and offers great insulation and probably a bit  
of sound deadening? Looks nice, too.  Gary gibson
