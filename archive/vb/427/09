Tried that with better quality gaskets yet? I had the same problem with 
JC Whipmey gaskets 15 years ago. Gaskets came with my Beetle when I 
bought it. Spent a whole day installing them and a year later they were 
turning to dust.

Another idea - Honda makes a silicone rubber protection grease. They 
sell it at the car dealers. Other vehicle brands prob also offer 
something similar. Buy some and coat new headlight gaskets when you 
install them.  Seems like I recall WCM offering lifetime warranty 
gaskets?  That was years ago. Dunno if that is still true.

Saw a splitty on the "Six Million Dollar Man" pilot episode the other 
day. The 1970s show. Was rolled over on it's side as if it ran off a 
road. They burned it at the end of a passenger rescue shoot. Floor of 
bus was rust free. At that time it was just an old van with little 
resale value I suppose.
