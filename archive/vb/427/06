Thanks Mark,

Got both seals and both in good condition as they were recently installed.
Kind of a pain to remove the clips and put them back in.

    My headlight buckets leak when washing my bus resulting in condensation

    the passenger (right) side, thus less leakage on the driver (left) side.
I've
    seen this on several buses. Is the right side sheet metal and bucket not
    formed as well as the driver side?

  hey chris there are 2 seals  on the splittie headlites  one around the glass
cover and another between the headlite and body.  IIRC wolfsburg west sells
them  later  mark d
