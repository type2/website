Subject: wiring and ignition

This is related to my '69 singlecab, but I believe the electrical idea is
the same no matter which vw I'm working on..

 

Quick wiring question.I have an ignition that I believe is from a '71 bus.
R-profile.

I want to use this in my '69 single cab. I was about to get all my stuff
keyed alike, and then install this into my truck.

 

I was just wondering, the wires on the back of this are different than what
appears to be the original wiring(based on diagrams only). Will I be able to
get this to work, without too much craziness? Currently the truck just has
some generic ignition drilled and mounted in the dash. I think it is just
some cheap thing from my FLAPS. It was on the bus when I got it.

 

It looks like the original ignition(which I never had) should have had just
three wires  to it. The one I want to install has 5. 

 

Suggestions appreciated, before I send this out to be re-keyed.

 

Thanks,
