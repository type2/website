Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch pedal spring

It's been a while since i did it, but you take off the bit that sticks through
the floor.
and you remove the clutch cable at the linkage under the floor.
And you remove the shaft that runs horzontal, that pivots inside the frame of
the bus.
Wire wheel it clean, grease it (grease is good!) and put it all back together,
with grease at all the moving parts.
The piece the clutch cable attaches to is notorious for wearing.   The hole
should be circular, not oval.
All these pedal moving parts should be lubed where metal wears aginast metal.

I should check them on the bus I drive...but it is raining, and the bus is
outside.    I topped the gear oil yesterday in the rain.   i can't pull the
bus in the garage due to a big pile of stuff sitting where I generally pull
the bus in.   And that stuff is there because of another thing elsewhere
happening.   so it just illustrates how all of life has cascading influences
on other facets of life.

Taking the shaft out might be slightly tricky.
 but that part, where it pivots, should be clean of rust and clean of dirt,
and properly lubed.
That hasn't happened probably since the bus was new.

Sometimes they rust solidly in place.    If yours moves, it's not as bad at
that,  :)

There may be helpful pics somewhere on thesamba, or in a bentley manual.
