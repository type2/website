Subject: Re: [VB] re:back to soundproofing

The biggest improvement I've made in sound suppression is to totally  
balance the engines I built. Statically and dynamically, cc the  
heads, deck height,  the whole 9 yards. You can blip the throttle and  
the engine just purrs. This is the place to start making a bus  
quieter.  Gary Gibson
