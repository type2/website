I am running hankooks on my '65.

As far as fabric on the interior seats, I think it should help a lot with
noise, I'm just not sure if I want to have fabric instead of vinyl, as vinyl
is so easy to keep clean. Then again with the modern fabrics, maybe I can
get one that is scotchguarded or whatever the modern equivalent of that is..
