Tootling around the Internet, I found a restoration site where the guys were 
discussing Peel'nSeal (Peel'nStick?). It's for sealing the valleys on the 
roof. Thick rubber with an adhesive back. Available at HD, Lowes etc. The 
users thought it was a very good substitute for FatMat. And wayyyy cheaper.

My concern with it,and with Fatmat, is that it might smell like old tires 
when in the hot sun. I can't stand that.
