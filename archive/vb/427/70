Hi Kevin,

"Mine has always been pretty loud, but there were many many reasons for that."

I was thinking some more about the noise level inside the bus and have
recently attributed a lot of noise to my tires. I am in the NW and a
popular tire around here is the Wildcat Light Truck tire. It has big
lugs and is very loud. I discussed this with a few bus owners that I
know and they agree. I do not know anyone who has the Hankooks but do
have friends that claim the Agilis, if that is what it is called, is
much quieter. So that might be something to think about in your quest
as well.

Max
