I made scoops for my '64 Deluxe way back when and riveted them on.

They were rectangular rather than triangular, and were sturdy enough and large enough to step into the lower portion and stand on the upper when tying off kayaks and other stuff on the roof rack.

Yeah, they were ugly, but very functional from a utilitarian perspective, but I have no idea whether they cooled the engine or not.

Jeff - who misses that '64 bus even though it would only go 54 mph
