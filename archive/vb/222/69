Hi Sean,
Veeerrryyy interesting!  Would be nice to figure out among the 64-65 Westies 
if there was a cut off between the two tops or if they just did both tops 
till the sub-hatch happened to be used up, but you really need to collect 
chassi numbers to make sure.
  No Clara, the bus you are thinking of that we had was a late 1964 model 
Kombi with dealer installed SO-33 Westie interior.  If it had had the 
sub-hatch it probably would have not left our stable of VWs!  That was one 
nice OG about 70,000 mile complete bus, and we are still upset that it got 
totalled when it was rear ended in a freak coincidence by the landlord of the 
new owner.  ;-(
