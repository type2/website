 nice OG about 70,000 mile complete bus, and we are still upset that it got 
 totalled when it was rear ended in a freak coincidence by the landlord of 
the 
 new owner.  ;-(

I remember it was a nice bus, wasn't it really solid?   I was surprised that 
a big back hatch bus was an early westy, I had thought the cut off was 63 at 
the time.
