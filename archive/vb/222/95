  The book is published in England so I am sure that Dave from
Ceative-engineering (a real inovator) and Ricki James, the KING of lowered
Barndoors had a lot of input in the book

Cool...  Maybe cool.  Some of these "hot rod" books are more fluff and 
"might could be done" than actual good advice.  Or they show you how to half

do a project and still leave you stranded.

Not sure what the book will be like, but I have to have it anyway :)
