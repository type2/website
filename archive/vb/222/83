How many of you with 65-down nosecones have opened up the web/baffle as
described in Bentley and at
http://www.longenterprises.com/technical_info/tech_tips.htm#Tech%20Tip%20#5
?  If you have, do you think it made a difference?  Do you use the early
or late gasket then? 

Ooh, it's fun learning all these details.  My rebuilt rancho from ronnie
arrived today (it's all black and purty with nice shiny nylock nuts),
along with the new redux bearings & misc. I'm getting closer....
