Subject: Re: [VB] What H4's is everyone using in ther Buses?

'61 Panel - Hella H4 90/100 watt w/ relays
'62 Kombi Swivel - Autopal H4 55/60 watt stock
'66 Meyers Manx - None (stolen to mount on toyota after room mate wrecked my
truck)
'85 Cabriolet - Hella H4 - 55/60 watt stock
55-60 watt bulbs pull about 4.5 - 5 amps and the 90/100 pull abut 5 - 6.2
amps.
The Autopals are cheapo H4's ($15 for a pair). They are decent for the price
which was cheaper than regular halogens.
The Hella's in comparison, well there is none. Hella's are far superior than
the Autopal's. And at 70 bucks a pair I would hope they were. Hella's light
pattern and beam projection are clear and percise.
