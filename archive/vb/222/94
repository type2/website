Subject: Non-walk-thru  boom boom 

Not a vintage nazi topic...

Has anyone here mounted a sub-woofer in the spare tire hole in a 
non-walk-thru bus?  Any size I am not picky.

Since my spare does not fit there anyway (15x7 Porsche Phone Dial - too 
wide) I am hoping to use the spare hiddy hole for something productive.

Also something removable and non-bus-hacking.  I do not want to hack a bus 
up just to sit a box in there or make anything permanent.

I am hoping to place a single 12" sub in that spot with a custom enclosure.  
Probably a sealed cabinet for clarity over boom-boom.  Nothing fancy.

Why:  Long interstate drives get monotonous...  Need loud music.

Thanks,
Adrian "ground shaker" Pillow
