Subject: Blaupunkt radio power/cabling.

Eric & Barb -or- Volk-a-maniacs,

While we are on the subject of Blaupunkt radios...  Does anyone have a
manual for the radio pictured here?

I am still looking into how to wire this thing up since my initial posting
last July... life got busy - 1 year old daughter just walked across the room
for the first time tonight!!  Now she can help me work on the bus.  :o)

Here are the markings on the Radio:
A sticker that has...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Wolfsburg III    Blauplunkt
7 638 061        WERKE GMBH
                      C 3962679
                      Made in Germany
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
And pressed into the metal chassis...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(VW) 111.035.101 B
BLAUPLUNKT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I have the Antenna, but that doesn't do me any good without power.  Then I
need to work out the speaker solution after I get this thing to power up.
With my previous post, Matt Roberts helped me identify the ports on the back
of this thing (picture at link above), but I still need a solution.

Thanks in advance,
Greg (and father-in-law Dan)
