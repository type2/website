Subject: Re: Port-A-Walls...

Just attempted to put a set of these on yesterday! I had two different tires 
places attempt to put them on, and they kept "bulging" at the side. I have 
195/60/15's and these were 15'' "Port-A-Walls," and they simply did not fit. 
They looked to be just a tad too big. I did notice on a website that I 
stumbled upon that they do come in several different 15'' sizes. :::Sigh:::: 
I decided to just go ahead and order the real thing. Found Goodyears in the 
195/60/15 size believe it or not, and with a 2-2 1/2 inch whitewall. They 
were around $135.00 each. So, needless 
to say, I have this 15'' set here if anyone is interested. Paid $50.00 for 
the set of 4, will let them go for $40.00. One is rather dirty from 
attempting to install, but all are in new condition. :-)

Cheers,
