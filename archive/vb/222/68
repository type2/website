Hi Eric,
First you should check your bus dimensions to the ones in the "Workshop 
Manual Volkswagen Transporter" section A-23, page 1.  After all your bus 
could have been "repaired" at one time!
Our two running buses have 1/8" clearance at the rear of the door and about 
3/16" at the front.  Though the 1960 walk thru camper converted panel van has 
its passenger door 1/16" farther back than the others.
