The V is there to hold the head of the from turning because the nut screws on from the engine side.
On later doghouse engines, a threaded insert was pressed in from the engine side. The later trans case does
not have the V.
You are mis-matching old technology with new technology:)
I went thru this once..... had to use an open end wrench and slowly unscrewed the bolt a little at a time.
Finally got it out.
Then I went and got an Allen head bolt the same size as the one I took out. The Allen head clears the V with
no problem.
