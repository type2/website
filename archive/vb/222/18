Subject: Re: [VB] Sub hatch in 1965?

well, westfalia is not the same as VW.  I have heard of a few 65 westies that 
were the subhatch style.  I might have even seen one.  Eric and Barb, didn't 
you used to have a nice, light blue 65 sub hatch westy?  But ya, usually the 
65s were the SO 42s (or 44s)

my 65 westy is the SO-42 version, no pop top.  But I think the drive away 
tents - the ones that have the bead that slides into the rail on the bus,  
came later .  My bus has the brackets on the roof and front bumper for the 
westy tent pole to attach to.

Ask for pictures of the guys bus.  sounds neat.

 thanks for the info...the bus it is on is a 65 westy sub hatch...when they 
made the switch to the pop top mid 65 they went to the bid top drive-away 
style tents.
