Yes.  http://lighting.mbz.org/tech/relays/relays.html has a fairly
decent write-up, although it's not specific to Buses.  Note how the
"beam selector switch" (dimmer switch or relay) stays in the circuit.

Also note that his diagrams assume a front-engine car.  The two wires
that go from terminal 30 on the relay to the alternator would, on a Bus,
run back to the battery or starter at the back.
