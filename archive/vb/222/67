Hi Jason,
You are welcome!  Yes, about that deep.  We have on occasion drilled just a 
tad too deep and it is a breeze to weld the tiny hole through into the 
interior of the RGB back up with the RGB apart.  Of course if you do not want 
to take the RGB apart one could silicon the bolt, RGB and swing axle for now 
together to prevent leakage there.  Personally we always silicon the RGBs to 
the swing plates on the 1964-67 RGBs to make sure they never leak around the 
RGB metal plugs.  Also doing this keep water from getting sucked in due to 
capliary action and thusly keeps rust out of the area!
