Subject: Front door gaps.....

Hi everyone,

On my current bus (a 64), it looks like my front doors are not sitting right.

I have a large gap where the back edge of the doors meet the body. It's like
the doors are slid foreward too much. I measured the gaps, and the passenger
side has a gap of .250", and the driverside is .300".

It just seems that a quarter inch or more is just too much of a gap, but
taking a quick look at where the door hinges attatch to the body, there is no
adjustment to move the door back.

Hinges look straight, and bus has never been hit (original paint), so it seems
odd that the gaps are like this.

Is this normal, or do I have to find a way to shim the door hinges to narrow
that gap?

Thanks,

Eric Allred
