Subject: Re: [VB] Redux repair redux

Ah, it's so hard to find a $1.00 part for a buck anymore.   Back  when I was 
a kid I'd make redux plugs out of rocks,  That's right, I'd shape them with 
my fingernails while I was walking to school. ten miles through the snow, 
uphill, both ways, yup.  
and I enjoyed it.
 No we're not there yet!  Yup, cause we couldn't afford a buck then.  I'd 
sell them for two cents each.  I was proud to have two cents.  Yup.  We ate 
for a week on two cents. 

 well, that was my two cents.
