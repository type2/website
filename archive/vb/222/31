Dave,

I'm running the 55/100W bulbs that I picked up from aircooled.net.

They are unbelievably bright, no relays either.  Just plugged them in and turned them on.  I use my high beams quite a bit and for extended lengths of time with no ill effects.

The light pattern is awesome compared to the previous sealed beams.
