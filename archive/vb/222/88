Subject: Saying good by to my 60 Double Cab...

Last night my 60 Double Cab drove off for the last time. Bryan from
Arizona came up and picked it up (Thanks Ronnie for telling him about my
Double Cab). During negotiations I had a call from a very nice overseas
buyer but Bryan had already expressed definite interest. I quickly got
back to him and worked it out so the truck could stay here. I have had
that Double Cab for over 9 years and it will be missed, but I think it
went to a really good home. If you see a tan 60 Double Cab cruising down
I5 in the next couple days wave and say hi.

Splittyless for the first time in a loooong time. Will be looking for a
double door or walk thru panel project eventually.
