If they are truly 100W lamps they will draw 7.7A at 13V.

I've run some of those "hot" 100W high beams and note two things.  Make
sure that they are made by a reputable maker and have a ceramic (not
plastic) insulator.  I have had cheaper 100W H4s overheat and ruin the
headlight connector, right before melting their own internal connections
and failing.  Not fun.
