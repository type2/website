Hooray !  I can't stand those fake "blue" bulbs either.  I see them all the time on the small import cars, but only for a second - them I am momentarily blinded.   On the other hand, they do go well with most spoilers and anodized windshield wiper arm covers.

"blue" bulbs from your Bus. Now. At best they aren't any better than
regular bulbs and at worst they are dangerous.
