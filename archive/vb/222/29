Subject: Re: [VB] Engine bolt question.

At the risk of adding even more chaos to this thread, I invite Jason to
peruse my webpage description of how I resolved this situation, AFTER he
gets that bolt out.

My solution makes pulling and installing your engine, with a doghouse,
easy and quick, and uses one special tool, the ratcheting 17mm flat
wrench, available at Sears. This is AFTER you've gotten that bolt out of
there.
