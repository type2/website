Isn't ohm's law P=E*I ? That would mean that an 60 watt 12 volt bulb 
would draw 5 amps and an 100 watt 12 volt bulb would draw 8.33 amps. So 
if you have wiring that barely handles 6.2 amps you will be very 
unhappy when you try to draw the actual 8.33 amps. Just a thought.

55-60 watt bulbs pull about 4.5 - 5 amps and the 90/100 pull abut 5 - 
6.2
amps.
