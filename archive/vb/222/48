Subject: mirror arm minutia

Hi guys ,
I'm installing some small mirror arms on the 65 westy 
and want to know the correct OG washer / nut combo
for this. 
On the og 62 we used to have i remember a fiber washer and a 
flatter nut with the locking washer with the bending tabs.

So, is there supposed to be a fiber washer above the hinge?
On the top and bottom? Was the original nut flatter, or am I
imagining this?

Vintage nutzis please reply.
Thanks
Larry
