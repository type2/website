Hi Craig,
Hmm, those cast iron guides are allright unless you park the engine for a 
long period and have the guides rust to the valves!  We agree with having 
them bored and bushed with bronze as your machinist suggested.  Definitely 
wierd about the too short ones.

you should be able to clean those up yourself with a good fine flat file and 
a honing tool for alot less!
