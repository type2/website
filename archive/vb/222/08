I highly recomend not buying anything on ebay from a guy named Bill Webb, from Austrailia. He runs or is part of "carsonline.com.au" and sells stuff on ebay. He took me for $81.44 when he charged me twice for a set of ambulance fans for a bay. I have been getting the run-around and BS excuses since Feb 8th. You know how it goes: " we ran it through", "Bill is out of the office", "I will personally send it out" (almost three weeks ago!), Bill had a cra wreck a month ago and his jaw is messed up" (I have talked to him on the phone twice!) blah, blah, blah.

To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no choreography, and the dancers hit each other.
