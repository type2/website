Adrian,

It been awhile since I had the boom boom myself, but I am thinking of doing 
the same, except I have a walk through.

I'm pretty sure, If you made an enclosure, and used the specs of a spare tire 
as the max dimensions of the box it could be done.  

I'm not up to speed on the latest subs, but I know the Kicker solobarics used 
a minimal amt. of airspace in its enclosure and should be able to be done in 
the spare tire size.

I think a 10" with a properly matched enclosure would work quite well in a 
bus, although I think you might be muffled behind the seat and/or the sound 
may not optimal.

If you've got a camper, the space under the jumpseat is ideal, but you loose 
that usable space.

My plans are to make the same spare tire enclosure you are think of except 
mine is in the back (walk-thru)
