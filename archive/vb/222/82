Subject: Nosecone bushing q

I've put these questions to Ronnie, who I got the parts from, but I
thought I'd query the list as well (65 bus):

I was putting in the nosecone bushings tonight and I'm stumped by
something.  I got the inner bushing tapped in OK.  But both the remaining
plain bushing and the one with the oil seal are a loose fit in the
outer end of the nosecone.  Did I put the wrong bush on the inner end?
But if so why would the oil-seal outer bush be loose also?

I read in Bentley that 66-up nosecones had the bush with the oil seal
stock but it can't be retrofitted - you have to replace the whole
nosecone.  Could it be that I have a 66-up bush w/oil seal?  Long
Ent. sells a replacement with the oil seal designed to retrofit the
earlier nosecone, they say at:

http://www.longenterprises.com/technical_info/tech_tips.htm#Tech%20Tip%20#5

They call it p/n 001 301 209A.

Even if both remaining bushes were the right diameter I suppose I'm to
pick one or the other?  I assume the three bushings in the kit were not
intended to all be used.

Anyhow, you can tell I'm confused.  Let me know if you think I've got some
wrong parts and/or have put the wrong bushing on the inner end (as far as
I knew both were the same dia but I didn't look closely).

Thanks,
