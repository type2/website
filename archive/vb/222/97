Subject: Re: [VB] Front door gaps.....

Thanks E&B,

That's a good idea. Like I say, the bus is all original paint, and shows no
signs of ever being hit, but maybe something happened in the past that may
have required something like the bumper to be replaced, and tweaked the body
enough to make a gap like this. Something that would not have been noticed,
with only the bumper being replaced (Bumpers have been re-painted, but he
rest of the bus has not, hmmmmm). If it is tweaked, anyone have any tips to
get the door area straightened out? I've used a hydraulic jack and 2x4's in
the past to straighten beetle trunk areas and spare tire wells, but haven't
messed with something this big before. Anything to be cautious of before I
start trying to 'tweak'? Bus is rust free, so I shouldn't have to worry
about anything being weaker than normal.

I'll check the measurements this weekend.

Thanks again for the idea!
