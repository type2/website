Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Port-A-Walls...

I never had much luck with port-a-walls either.  I remember as a kid helping my dad put them on his various Hudsons.  They always bulged, a real PITA if you ask me. They would never seat against the tire sidewall.   We always had to put the worst ones in the back where the fender skirts hid them.  I know in his case, decent whitewalls are once again available (radials of course  ), so he's gone away from port-a-walls all togather.  I don't know if there any sizes that would accomadate a bus, but I would assume so as most vintage cars have tall narrow tires and are pretty heavy.
