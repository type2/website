Hi John,
To be correct as VWoA envisioned thier VWs with radios when your bus was 
sold, then yes.  Remember these radios were installed by VW dealers often a 
few years later when the owner could afford a radio after paying off thier VW 
and/or your VW got what the dealer had left over in thier stock.  Plus many 
DPOs when they found a wrecked VW would pull a radio out for thier VW.  So 
there are cases were a bit of not quite right year or type as long as it 
fitted the VW dash and even some that required hacking like some of the 
Accord pull out radios of the 1960s.  We even have official Blaupunkt radio 
instruction info for installing one of thier new 1961 fully transistor radios 
in a 1956 bug!
