Subject: Re: [VB] Engine bolt Thanks

Well folks, looks like I have yet again proved that my wife is
correct. I can be quite the putz when needed :)

Turns out that the notch in the transmission actually has enough
clearance to turn. So now the engine is out & the transmission will be
out the next day or so. I have no idea why I couldn't get it to do
anything last night, but what a difference a night makes.

thanks for the encouragement. Now to knock out that damn plug & put a
real nut on that side.
