Was  that wiper motor in the 65 actually a 67 12V one?   Look at
the actual motor part that is on the frame assembly thing.  if it is
shaped like a cylinder- that is the 66/67 deal.  the 65 one is more
rectangular.

Thanks for the info,...
Yes, this is a 65...it has the 'normal-looking' rectangular motor. In a
post in May, Thomas Ainlay took a '67 beetle wiper motor guts(12volt)
and replaced the guts in the 65 motor. I tried it and it works! I
believe
that it will work only with the 65 motor though and not earlier(don't
quote
me though!). I still have copies of the posts, if anyone is interested.
Have a great New Year
