Subject: X-mas drive

Just came back from a drive up to the local tall spot.   Only 26 miles, but 
it took an hour to get there.   Last ten miles were logging/gravel roads, but 
actually really well kept.  There was snow on the ground up there, and a 
wicked cold wind.  Why does the land seem blue from high up?   there was an 
excellent view, it's nice to get out in the boonies once in a while.   The 
heater works great, and the lower half of the bus is filthy now.   Heard a 
wierd squeaky noise on the way back, but some WD-40 on the gas pedal hinge 
made it go away.  I'm such a geek, I love my bus.  Driving down a country 
road with the motor purring is such a good feeling

Happy Holidays

Clara
