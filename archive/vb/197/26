Subject: x-mas drive too

i just drove back from my folks house, about 6 miles from my house. big snow
storm. when i first went out to my car, it was covered in snow/ice. the
drivers side door had about 1 inch of ice build up on it, no way of possibly
opening that door. luckily the passenger door was not so bad. so after about
10-15 minutes scraping, i felt that everything was clear enough to get
started.

i turn the key and it starts-first try, no struggle. pretty impressive for a
6 volt, in a freezing snowstorm. i pull out slowly, and proceed to make the
drive home in a blowing snow storm, with only one little fishtail(barely
noticeable, probably only noticeable to me the driver) my bus performed
great. powered through the snow on the roads.

the only obstacle i ran into-the plows had left a large snow bank at the end
of my driveway-that was mostly frozen through. luckily there was a free spot
on the street. tomorrows fun, shoveling that bank out of the way, so i can
get my bus off the street.

this all reminds me of an ad for buses that shows a bus going up a hill on a
road well covered in snow, the advert. mentions something about how great
the bus is in the snow. anyone remember this ad, or know where i can find a
copy of the image on the net-none of my friends or family beleive the story.

thanks
