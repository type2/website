Subject: Double Cab rocker replacemtn

I have a quesiton about DC rocker replacement - how?  My outers
appear to be fine, but it appears that the inners were damaged not
by the elements, but by the hand of a PO - there's a couple of 
areas where pieces were removed for no good reason.

I could section in the missing pieces, but I'm contemplating replacing
both inner and outer; when you replace the outer, how do you deal with the
big seam at the bed line?

Thanks!

Thom
