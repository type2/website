Subject: RE: [VB] question about nyloc nuts

  All aftermarket tie rod ends and drag links now have ny-locks (at least
all the ones I have seen in the last 3 years) maybe except Ocap brand. I do
not know of any manufacturers that still use castle nuts. Even all the SWAG
(made in Germany) 
tie rod ends and ball joints all have castle nuts.   Castle nuts went out
the way of a lot of other items as parts improved. I am not condemning
castle nuts or praising them or ny-locks but that is what's available and
what about every automotive manufacturer uses today, As I stated I have
never (20 years of air cooled Porsche and VW) have had a ny-lock fail. I am
not saying this as a vendor, but from experience.
  A question to the list: How many of you have new tie rods, ends and/or
drag links with ny-loks instead of castle nuts?

A castellated nut is required when there is a cotter pin hole.
I would not use a tie rod end that had none.
I personally am not so lucky as to afford one failure.
Vendor testamonials won't save you. Any warranty on those, Ronnie ?
( If not, your word is good as gold :)
