Subject: Snake oil or cool tool?

A friend of mine gave me an article about this tool 
http://www.sunchasertools.com/  I guess its been covered in all the
resto mags out there, but I've never heard about it.  Does anybody out
there have this or know about it?  Is it just hype or is it the real
deal?
