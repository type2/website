Subject: Going to Germany - Friday topic... kinda

Howdy fellow volk-a-maniacs,

I have been given the opportunity to travel to Stuttgart, Germany in a couple
of weeks for my day job.  I have business on the Monday/Tuesday of that week
but have the remainder of the week until Saturday to see what there is to be
seen.  My wife is going with and is very excited to travel, so I can get away
with a little VW hunting while we are there.

I have plans to track down some parts for our (father-in-law & my) '67, if I
run across a factory, store, shop, local enthusiast, junk yard or whatever I
can find.  Nothing too serious, just a few memento items for nostalgic
purposes.

Does anyone have a few suggestions on sites to see while I am there?  VW Bus
related of course...

Thanks in advance,
Greg (and Dan)
