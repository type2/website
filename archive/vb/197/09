Subject: [VB] Got my Microbus Calendar in time for Xmas!

And I didn't have to buy it off eB*y, neither!  Turns out that all them
calendar kiosks at our malls and bookstores had the 2 different VW
Beetle calendars but nobody had this new Microbus calendar from
Browntrout--so I finally had to order one from Calendars.com.  So maybe
it isn't the best bus calendar ever, and it does have a Eurovan
(thankfully not on a monthly page) and a Vanagon synchro to gum up the
perfection, but, hey, it has 11 beautiful monthly splitties and no 'fat
chicks'!  Two of them doublecabs!  Worth the wait!

Merry Christmas and may you all find your own bus calendars under the
tree tomorrow....
