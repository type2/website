Ken has been pretty much selling his shrinking disc by word of mouth and 
what ever coverage he gets in the DIY/Hot Rod mags.  He hits the local swap 
meets from time to time and I watched him shrink a fender at the Hot Rod 
Swap meet in Long Beach last year.  It did just what he claims it 
would.  He HIGHLY recommends that you purchase the complete "system" which 
includes a video on how to use it.  Apparently, its not as obvious at he 
thought it was and he had some unhappy customers until they saw how to use 
it properly.

I'm not affiliated with him in any way, this is just a brain dump from what 
I remember in talking with him last year.  I didn't end up buying one as I 
was in the hunt for something else at the time.
