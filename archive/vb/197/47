Subject: Re: [VB] Wiper motors interchange?

A 65 wiper motor will fit in an earlier bus.   The 66/67 wiper motor however, 
will not fit unless you 'massage' ie mash the heater defrost vents.   Was 
that wiper motor in the 65 actually a 67 12V one?   Look at the actual motor 
part that is on the frame assembly thing.  if it is shaped like a cylinder- 
that is the 66/67 deal.  the 65 one is more rectangular. 

lube all the joints in the assembly before installing it.  with grease.  
because your bus likes grease.

Sometimes taking the motor aparts and replacing the grease makes the motor 
work again.  It definately makes it run smoother and quieter.

<< Hello, All...  The wiper motor in my newly acquired '58 is burned up,
 apparently having been used too long on 12volts. Will the wiper motor
 from a '65(the one with the integral frame assembly) fit the '58? The
 '65 assembly has already been converted to 12volts.
 Thanks!
