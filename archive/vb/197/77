  Gentley tap on the back side of the drag link end. This will set it in the
hole allowing the nylock to tighten all the way. If you use castle nuts you
will have to drill a hole for a cotter key, way more work then necessary.
All of my buses have ny-lock nuts on the tie rod ends and the drag link and
have never had a failure.

Subject: [VB] question about nyloc nuts


Hi,

This is my first experience using nyloc nuts - the last time I worked 
with suspension components they only had castelated nuts.

As I'm putting the drag link back on, the nut and stud spin together - 
how in the world do you get the nyloc nut tight if it spins with the 
stud? The adjustable end seemed to tighten properly. Is this a sign of 
a bad drag link? Trying to loosen it does the same thing - spins the 
stud with the nut. Is this just a sign of a bad joint/stud? Or is this 
something I did or didn't do...

Thanks,
Conrad
