There probably is.  Suspects include acetone, Lacquer thinner, and MEK (in
order of increasing nastiness)

The problem is getting the solvent to the place it needs to be to dissolve
the epoxy.  If the epoxy fills the gap, it will take a long time for the
solvent to work its way in.  The best route is to immerse the part in the
solvent, but with a case that is more than a notion.

One reaches the point where you have to ask if the case is worth the
aggrivation.

BTW, it appears that VW de Mexico is now using Hylomar on the center case
mating surfaces.  Hylomar never dries and has the consistancy of thick
grease without the slipperyness.  Good stuff, both from the sealing and
disassembly standponts.
