Dang, Its hard to say but $30.00/ hr is where i'm running labor rate wise. I
had intended on an increase first of the year but i'm now thinking of
holding off for a bit maybe 6 months at least. My first thing would be yank
the doors off and push as much as possible to see how bad the damage to the
door area's is (ie what might spring back into place after stress released)
then cut and replace what don't. For instance remove windshields and cut
there, the back glass area .The drivers side looked pretty intact , so might
be able to save all the side wall and just replace the roof area there. If
possbile at the windsheild area only replace roof section. I'd guess around
2k to 2.5k ,THat would hinge on the condition of the bulkhead,b-pillarand
the rear door jamb. The jamb is pushed down there so it might have to be
replaced. Thats about the best i can do from the pics on the page, later
