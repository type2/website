Subject: question about nyloc nuts

Hi,

This is my first experience using nyloc nuts - the last time I worked 
with suspension components they only had castelated nuts.

As I'm putting the drag link back on, the nut and stud spin together - 
how in the world do you get the nyloc nut tight if it spins with the 
stud? The adjustable end seemed to tighten properly. Is this a sign of 
a bad drag link? Trying to loosen it does the same thing - spins the 
stud with the nut. Is this just a sign of a bad joint/stud? Or is this 
something I did or didn't do...

Thanks,
Conrad
