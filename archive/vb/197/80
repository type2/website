Subject: Used Case $$ question, 1600 DP needed

I recently pulled the engine from my ' 63 only to discover that the case is from 2 different engines! Right side is a 211 # , the left is a 113# .  Amazingly, the bottom end of the engine seemed pretty clean and tight...  Anyway, now I need a good used 1600 DP case,  good enough to rebuild.  I checked with some local shops (Tampa ) and they are asking $200.00 - $250.00 for one that hasn't even been checked out which seems rediculous to me. I am just curious about the value of a decent used case these days? Anyone?  

Also if anyone in the Tampa area has one for sale, please P-mail me

Thanks,

Matt
