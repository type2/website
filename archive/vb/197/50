Subject: Bilstein shocks.

I ordered the Bilstein shocks today from www.shox.com.

$266 for a set including shipping charges.  Essentailly $61 each, which is 
the best price I have seen.

Fronts PN: B46-0032
Rear PN: B46-0040

Will report back on if they are worth the extra bucks...  Granted from my 
experiences with previous Bilstein shocks they are hands down way better 
than KYBs, Tokicos, and of course stock units.  The only thing better would 
have to be Konis, but they are like $120 each and way overkill for a bus.

Happy New Year,
Adrian
