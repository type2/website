Subject: FS Type IV High Lift cam, lifters, push rods.

For sale Weber Solid Lifter Camshaft .297 lift, unknown duration. 
I don't know the part number.
Asking $150.00 for the cam, solid lifters and aluninum solid lifter
pushrods. With the cam gear installed add $20.00.
The cam still has the parkerizing on it so it is a low mile cam and shows
NO wear pattern.
Stock Type IV cams are about .238 lift so I'm going to guess this as a
fairly radical cam.
It came out of a CV series Type IV engine that ate a head after it
dropped a valve seat.
