Subject: RE: [VB] question about nyloc nuts

I just installed my first one after 29 years, a left tie rod last month,
and was a bit nervous about the nyloc, but it went on nice, and tightened
up just fine. And I've never had any nylocs go bad anywhere else, such as
on the engine, which gets plenty vibrations and heat. Besides, you'd get
plenty of warning if it loosened up even just a bit.
