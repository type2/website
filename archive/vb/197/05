Hi Mike,

Awesome post, don't ever be shy about writing in and chatting with everyone
here.  As long as there is some Bus content in your message, you'll be
accepted here!  It was fun to read of your VW experiences over many years, and
I'm sure that someone who has done a dash repair will speak up and offer
advice.  And thanks for reminding us all that there will be many Americans
this Christmas who won't be at home who are defending our freedoms overseas,
and that we should all be thinking of them too this Holiday Season.  In my job
as a flight attendant, especially during the Holiday season, whenever I see a
serviceman in uniform riding home or back to duty, I like to make it a point
to chat with them for a moment and offer them an adult beverage of their
choice "on me" as a small way of saying thanks.

Personally, I don't know of anyone who bought their Bus new and still has it.
I've owned my '67 Westy since 1984, and I still have a 1970 Karmann Ghia that
I bought way back in 1974.  Hopefully some original owner will respond to your
post and tell us their story.

Happy Holidays to everyone!
