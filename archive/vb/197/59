Subject: OK to relax~ CLOWN babies, *NOT* cloned babies!

It's OK to relax folks. It's been a BIG misunderstanding. With that funky
Euro-trash accent translated into English, the representative of that whack
pack Raelian sect was talking about bringing back CLOWNING. They only wish to
raise a generation of kids who embrace CLOWNING as an art form.
After all the bad mouthing over the years about untalented mimes with that
boring old 'trapped in the invisible box' bit, endless old Lucille Ball and
Carole Burnett skits (that wouldnt die) and Red Skelton reruns, not to mention
the unbelievable forced faked Allan Alda laugh in the M.A.S.H. re-runs we, as a
society, have fallen away from clowns and clowning. The closest that the
current generation have come to clowning is M.C. Hammer, f*ggot 1980 leftovers
with Flock of Seagull haircuts, Suge Knight/Rap music et al., all of the
pathetic GOTH losers who hang around the pinball arcades years after their
peers should have graduated High school and the current President. We all had
it wrong! Clown babies will kill us with laughter by 2020.

The agency is comprised of Swedish ABBA fans who just want humanity to create
and transport Volvos, NOT humanity created and transported via UFO's. They are
worried that the Wallenius RO/RO (roll-on/roll-off) ships would be in danger
because of the fricken Middle East, Korean and Venezuelan threats to peace as
we know it.
Pull out the Gilda Radner "Hard of Hearing Lady" Weekend Edition bit when
really necessary...
Raelian sect? no, more like "Really, Ann" as if we'd believe her! Ha.
