Subject: re:cleaning hardware

i have not done this, but my friend brings his parts to a shop around
here...that cleans them all. they have a parts washer-i don't think it takes
off rust, just grease oil etc.

the way he described it to me-you bring your parts in, and they have a
bucket about the size of a standard laundry basket. then they put it in the
machine-kind of like a dishwasher, which squirts all sorts of de-greaser at
high pressure over the parts, does a great job, only around $25 for a
basket.

if anyone is interested i can try to find out the name/type of shop he went
to.
