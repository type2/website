Subject: Cylinder studs

Hey y'all
I'm converting a dual port longblock to single port.  I need the 4 inner 
upper longer studs (8mm) for a single port.  Any of you vendors out there 
have a set for sale separately or do I have to do the inevitable and buy a 
complete set?  Contraiwise, aren't they the same length as the outers?
