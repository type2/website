Can someone verify these PNs for me?

211 501 235  and  
211 501 236

My parts book is saying all busses up to 20-117901 (End of BD
production).  Anyone have a stub axle and lower gear for one of these? 
It need not be perfect, just useable.  If not, does anyone need these? 
Be aware the condition is very rusted and they are partially complete. 
The were sitting out side for MANY years from the looks of them.
