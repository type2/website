Subject: RE: Crew cab

I did a walk through 4-door crew cab a few years ago, sold it though to
a guy in Mexico City. He flew up here to Seattle and drove it all the
way home. 
I have seen another walkthrough crewcab up here as well, seems the last
time I saw it was at Freds show (Ovals Motor sports) in Federal way
about 4-5 years ago. It also had a nicely made metal tilt on the back.
