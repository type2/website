Subject: Wiper motors interchange?

Hello, All...  The wiper motor in my newly acquired '58 is burned up,
apparently having been used too long on 12volts. Will the wiper motor
from a '65(the one with the integral frame assembly) fit the '58? The
'65 assembly has already been converted to 12volts.
Thanks!
DUCK
