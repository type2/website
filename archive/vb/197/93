Subject: looking for lost reply.

I misplaced an e-mail I received from a list member. 
I had written about mounting a hitch to a bus bumper. 

The member offered an old bumber they already had this
hitch mounted too.  They offered to take it to Havasu,
where I would take possesion of said item.  This
connection I would like to make again before the trip.
 
By the way list,thanks for all the replies.  Using
this system will be my extremely short turn plan.  My
next purchase, a truck with capabilities to tow a
flatbed trailer for transpoting busses.  Wherever I
have room to park a bus, I'll just leave the trailer
there and park the bus on the trailer.  Then whenever
it came time to work on the undercarriage I can climb
under the trailer.  Kind of like a ghetto car lift. 
Of course the floor will be mostly ribs instead of a
sheet of metal or diamond plate.  Hope to see some of
you in Havasu.  Aub
