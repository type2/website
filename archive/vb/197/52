If I had done that I would have been cryng in my beer last summer in Utah.
I broke a stud flush with the case and I was very lucky that I was able to
back it out with careful use of a custom-ground punch.

If VW doesn't use goop on the studs, I don't think that it is a good idea
for anyone to do so.
