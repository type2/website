Subject: RE: [VB] cylinder studs sealant?

Ouch! Yeah this didn't seem like a good idea to me, but then again, the
whole case, oil pump, etc is Permatex 1 (the super tough hard glue one?)
togther. So far we bent a oil pump puller at the cross metal, and broke
another at the weld. Might be interesting when we try and pull the case
halves apart, perhaps two VWs pulling each half? More later, it's in the
junk pile until the new GOOD motor is installed, then we'll see if the
'spare' is a case fire or a shortblock.

Any solvent to melt this stuff?

I broke a stud flush with the case and I was very lucky that I was able to
back it out with careful use of a custom-ground punch.

...If VW doesn't use goop on the studs, I don't think that it is a good idea
for anyone to do so.

The above sentance sure is a word of wisdom, if it didn't come that
way......
