Subject: Workshop questions

This may be slightly off topic. But I'll give it a shot anyway.

We bought a house in town and I've purchased a 24' X 24' metal 2 door 
garage kit. Gotta put a slab in first. How deep will I need it to be? 
Is 6" too much or will I need it to be that deep.

Working on a budget and not looking to build the ultimate shop or 
anything. Just a home workshop.

p.s. This moving into town stuff is for the birds. Don't know how I 
let my wife talk me into it. It was a late night discussion in 
bed....if you know what I mean. Being a man sucks sometimes. Can't 
think straight.
