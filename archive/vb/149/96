It's a metal building "kit" from a place local to me that makes them 
for contractors. I could afford the kit, but not enough to pay 
someone else to put it up.

It's going in my backyard. The building is constructed on the 
slab/foundation. I have to install anchor bolts as the 
slab/foundation is being done.

I wanted to try and do the slab/foundation myself as...again....I 
can't afford to pay someone to do the whole thing. I have considered 
finding someone to help with the finishing. Anyway. I'll be able to 
afford the concrete in a few weeks so will working toward getting the 
truck out here til then.

Any advice appreciated for sure.
