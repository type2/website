Ditto for me.  You have to use a cheap 6-inch Radio Shack speaker (and
not from their quality autosound line, either) because it's the only one
thin enough to fit inside the dashboard and avoid the wiper mechanism. 
Definitely not for the audiophiles.

Once you get the speaker, mounting it is another thing altogether.  You
can't mount the speaker to the speaker bracket and then mount the whole
thing inside the dash, without removing the parcel tray.  Plan B is to
stick each item inside the dash, bolt them together (a bit tricky), then
bolt the bracket to the dash.  It may be necessary to unbolt the grab
handle at some point, also, rebolting when speaker assembly is in place.
