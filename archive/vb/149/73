Subject: Broken exhaust stud

While removing the muffler from an old 1600 I was working on, I sheered off
one of the rusty  exhuast studs (insert string of profanities here!). So how
the heck do I get that thing out of the hole so I can put a new stud in? I
understand there are extractor bits(?) for this, but I have no idea what to do
or how to do it? Can anyone give me a quick tutorial in removing sheered off
exhaust studs? (It is sheereed off flush with the engine head)

Peace, John Baker
