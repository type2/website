Subject: Re: Belly Pans!


	Does anyone have a source for belly pans I called West Coast
Classic today and they no longer have a set. The Belly Pans are going on
my 65 Deluxe and I would like them to be good quality. But I will take
what I can I need just the left and right pans not the one in the
center.


Thanks for your help
