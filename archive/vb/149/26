I recommend anti-sieze grease for the parts (coupling, its screw,
shift-rod-end that fits into the coupling) under the bus. I use regular
grease on the shifter assembly itself. I also get both types of greases
all over the seat covers, my hands, and all the tools, even ones I
haven't used in the job itself - funny about that.
