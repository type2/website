Subject: re:volts 6x2=12

i think the only way to get 12volts out of a 6v system is to get an
inverter/converter or whatever it is called. I think ronnie at oldvolks has
them.
I actually got two old radio shack ones off the net, and haven't had time to
hook the up yet. so no idea how well they work
