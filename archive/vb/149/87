Ummm, isn't that a Motorola alternator?  Unless I am mistaken, I believe you
need to get the correct matching Motorola regulator.
Under the rear seat of a lot of mid to late 70's bugs....try to get the
harness with it.....

 Only thing that has me baffled is I don't think my
alternator(yes alternator) is charging the battery.  I have the wiring
diagram, but this thing is wacky.  OK, the wire with the loop that has 12
volts when you turn the key on goes to the bolt that sticks out of the top
of the alternator right?  and this bolt should have at least 13 volts when
running w/o having the wire hooked to it, right?  This came out of a 73 ghia
and I didn't grab the regulator before I sold the car, so I have a standard
bosch regulator that I picked up at the last swap for a buck.  I have not
installed it yet. Back to the alternator, there are 3 prongs coming out of
the top to the left of the bolt that sticks up, they are labled, but when in
the ghia they went to a female plug that snapped right on and to the
regulator.  I hope I am making sense.  So I get out my multi meter, unhook
the one wire from the alternator and start the engine, ground the black lead
and touch all 4 connections while its running and I am not getting anything.
  Do I have to have a ground on the alternator?  I am befuddled and
currently searching for a 73 ghia wiring diagram.
