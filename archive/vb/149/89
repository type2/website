Subject: [VB] re:I suck too! actually camper interior 

Regarding the wood used under the vynil flooring in a splitty bus 65-67 camper.
Yes, I used two pieces of plywood held together with metal cleats. 

I laid down strips of carpet padding (the kind that is made from shreded rags).
When I tore down the OG camper kit and exposed the (Westfalia) factory
subflooring there were long strips of blackish padding that looked similar to
the horsehair seat padding. It was laid only into the recesses of the
lengthwise running ribs of the metal floor.

On top of the strips of padding, I chose to lay down a sheet of 40mil thickness
grey rubber sheeting used in old school tile showers. The stuff is called
shower floorpan material. Available at Home Depot or similar sold off a roll by
the linear foot and comes in 5' (five foot) width.

I dry fit the two pieces of wood into the bus matching the original dimensions.
Also dry fit the aluminum dooredge trim at this time. Mark where the dooredge
trim goes. **Thickness of the vynil, glue and wood should be determined by the
thin slot that runs the inboard side of the aluminum trim edging that runs
along the doorsill of the cargo doors.** Dont base the thickness of the wood by
that slots thicknes- the vynil has to go into that slot too.
Don't forget to remember that the cargo doors have to close. Allow room! Stay
in the cargo area and close the doors and see what I mean. Remember that the
doors will have wood on them too.

I then cleated the two sheets of plywood together making sure that the cleats
were one the side closest to the bottom of the bus. Install the dooredge
aluminum trim first! It was originally secured with the same twisted nails as
previously described. With help from someone or multiple persons move the the
combined plywood into the cargo area and insert the edge of the wood closest to
the cargo doors into the thin slot of the pre-installed aluminum trim.
Hopefully you have friends and beer because this step is a b*tch!

The original wooden flooring and the aluminum door-edge trim was secured to the
bus floor via nails with the twisted shaft. I'd suggest a countersunk flat
headed screw. Touch up protruding nail/screws from under the bus with an
appropriate sealant.

Line the walls and adjacent surfaces to prevent spoiling paint with flooring
glue. I used super thin plastic painters dropcloths with the masking tape that
comes off easily. Dry fit the vynil flooring prior to gluing. Trust me!
Especially if you are using one solid sheet of flooring vs. tile squares.

Apply glue and install flooring material. I'd advise installing the edge into
the aluminum dooredge trim piece first and work inboard. Eventually remove the
painters drop cloths. Clean glue drips according to the label on the glue. I
used mineral spirits in well ventilated area. No time for a huffing high! ;-)

Good luck. I'm glad that I am not currently doing this procedure.
