Subject: Southerland Auto Transport

has anyone ever use these guys to transport a vehicle? They gave me a quote that's way lower than
anybody else....... I'm just wondering if that is not some kind of scheme. Hope my Bus will not have
to travel to Chicago via Seattle, Miami, New York and Toronto route....

It's either them or Auto Trail Transporters.....
Southerland - $624.75
Auto Trail - $740.00

anyone?

Big thanks!
