Subject: roofrack options

Good day bus pilots,
What are my options for a cheap roofrack? I recently bought an old building, now
I need to move lumber/plywood/etc with the camper. While I want the beautiful
westy repro rack as much as the next guy, I just can't afford it until I build
my way out of this hole I just jumped into. Any kind of mass production
luggage/ski/bike rack that fits a bus? If it cost less than $150 and only held
together only 6 months it would suit my purposes just fine, any suggestions?
