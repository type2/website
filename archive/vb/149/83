Hi Nick

If you want to be extra cautious, after you fill your engine with a oil
disconnect the line from the coil to distributor and then turn the engine
over a number of times to build you oil pressure backup without running the
engine.  In this case you don't have worry about the engine starting up
again without having oil fully distributed throughout the engine.  After
doing this than simply reconnect your coil wire and start your engine again
.
If your engine was just idling without a load on it you should be fine

Good luck
Bob
