Oooooh,

No wonder she's in trouble with the SEC, VWofA, the Pots 'n Pan
Association of America, ad nauseum.  I bet the turkeys are happy
though.

Actually Curt, JP told me that these scoops are already made for the
Martha
Stewart Collection at K-Mart. They are readily available for those bus
aficionados who like working w/ Martha/JP & have a plasma cutter to
fine
tune Martha's work for that truly vintage look.  Needless to say,
Martha has
already cornered the insider trading aspect of this endeavor!

Heh, heh, heh.
