Rex,
Depends on the soil conditions below.  Generally w/ well compacted soil(No
topsoil, organic matter)or undisturbed ground below the removed topsoil you
can pour a 4" thick slab using 4000 psi concrete(6 1/2+- bag mix concrete).
If your soil is not granular or doesn't drain easily, you should put a 4"
layer of gravel below the slab to help it drain any moisture that might get
below the slab that could cause it to buckle in freeze/thaw(don't know if
you have that in West Texas) or if you have expansive soils(some kinds of
clay) or collapsible soil(gypsum that shrinks when it gets wet).

This slab should be isolated from the foundation holding up the structure
for the Garage which should go deeper than the slab for structural reasons.
The slab should probably be broken up into four panels 12' x 12' w/ control
joints down the middle of the Garage both ways cuz its probably gonna crack
there anyway, and w/ a control joint it will be nice & straight & not
crooked & ugly as it will be if you don't put a control joint there first!

You didn't say what you are setting the Garage structure on.  Is someone
installing a foundation of some sort & then the garage on it, & you have to
provide your finish slab inside once they are done???  The slab/foundation
really depends on the structural conditions you have on site, as well as the
type of building you are buying.

More info & maybe we can figure this out w/o overkilling the budget, etc.
