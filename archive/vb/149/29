Subject: Help With Door Identification

Gang,

I have a 1956 Standard with some 1955 parts, what might be referred to as a
late model 1955.  Sorry no barn door.  I am trying to find a good driver
side door for the bus, however don't know what spanning years that my door
covers.  In other words is it a 50-55 door, a 56-62 door or a 62-69 etc...
Below are a couple of links to pictures of the door handle, the defining
factor.  Any help would be appreciated, so I can communicate correctly and
find a new driver side door -- BTW the handles pictured are passenger side.
Also, if there is a trade name for the door, like scallop handle, etc...

Thanks in Advance.
