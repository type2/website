Complete novice painters should stay away from the high end paints.
These can be considerably more difficult to apply, you need to paint
every day and have " the touch " to benefit from the material.
Even a good painter can't afford a few days off to maintain this skill level.
Most suppliers have the computer camera to make a formula from your
original, if that's what you require, they will even come to your bus if necessary.
If your supplier can't provide a formula for your # L346 , shop in another store.
Choose all the materials from the same supplier to minimize product incompatibility.
Some primers can be tinted to more closely match your topcoat, if necessary. ( $ ).
Consider acrylic enamel or single-stage urethane for ease of application ( and repairs ).
Mix as precisely as you can, and pay close attention to the label information as regards
surface preparation. Remember, paint is only a thin skin. Everything you see in the final
prep ( and more ) will be revealed in the topcoat six weeks after the job is done.

Subject: [VB] Mango Green - Seagull Grey


I'm trying to track down codes for Mango Green and Seagull Grey.  I do not need the L346 and L347 things but the formulas to mix
that paint. I would also like some advice on the best type of paint to use. I am a complete novice painter and I think I'll try and
do most of the prep work for my bus out side and either rent a spray booth or build one for actual painting. I was planning on using
R-M paint but when I went to pick up the paint and epoxy primer and the high build primer the colour was way way off.  I want to use
epoxy primer so what ever type of paint I use in the engine bay should work well with it. I had hoped to paint the engine bay and
the interior of my bus this weekend - damn.

TIA
