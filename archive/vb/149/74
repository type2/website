Subject: Need help with front torsion arm ID <again>

Hi,

I'm going crazy trying to finish the front suspension on my 65.

The torsion arms have a number below the VW mark, is this the year? The 
"original" ones say 2. The one I got from Tom Mink from a 66 has a 6. 
The ones from Bus Boys says 5.

The other difference is the mount for the shock absorber. Mine is at 
least twice as thick as the other ones.

The arms on my bus have closed ends. The other ones are open, and appear 
smaller at the elbow.

It's either that or I'll be sending my OG's to Bus Boys for them to 
match.

Thanks,
Conrad
