Subject: I suck too!

Mine is a vacuum leak.  Someone explain to me how this can cause so much of 
a problem.  I can adjust the carb down and the engine idles WAY fast.  I 
started at the head and used some of that silicone gasket on both sides of 
the metal one and then double checked the boots for any cracks or leaks.  
Tightened down the carb and started it up, vrooooom! still to fast, turning 
idle speed and mixture screw wouldn't slow it down even bottomed out mixture 
screw and it still ran fast, but turning it out made it faster.  So 
befudled, I pulled the entire manifold to remove the carb.  one of my studs 
is a bit higher, meaning the threads don't bottom out on the manifold, and 
it it won't go in any further.  the other 3 studs bottom out or almost do.  
So I am going to try another manifold and maybe another carb tomorrow.  Just 
can't believe that such a thing could cause so much of a problem.  The idiot 
book and the haynes book don't really mention much about vacuum leaks.  Is 
it a common thing or am I wasting my time with this progressive carb?
