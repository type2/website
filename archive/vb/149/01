For SP heads without porting and a small narrow throat carb on that
displacement, I wouldn't go over a E-100. Good response time for a bus
without demanding more than your intake can provide. Quite frankly, with
unported SP heads I would stay with the factory stick. VW engineers knew
what they were doing when they designed the engine and transmission/RGB
assembly. You have to remember, Europe has mountainous terrain too.

ok, i have nearly all the bits i need to start work on the 1700 SP T1 
motor... except the cam, and i could use opinions.
the engine is going to have a new aluminum case, machine-in 88 p/cs, 
a pauter engineering c/w 69mm crank and wedgemated, lightened 
flywheel with berg (heavy) achiever pulley, berg flow oil, SP heads 
that have some mild porting and a 3-angle valve job and some spring 
shims. likely carb is a stock 30-pict 2 or 3.
