Subject: Re: [VB] 15 Window Seat Colors

hm letsee- green bus gets como green interior.  front seat not green... hm 
usually a bus has all seat the saem colour
hm, maybe after thirty years the front seat got thrashed?
aha!  front seat was replaced or recovered.  yup, yup.

<< 
 list:
 
 my *new* '63 15 window is turkis/blue white.  the middle and rear seats are
 como(?) green, or maybe it's turquoise, i'm not sure.  but they're green.
 the front 1/3, 2/3 seat is commercial grey with ivory piping, original
 material on all 3 seats.  
 
 i've never owned a deluxe, but logic tells me the front seat is either not
 original to the bus, or at minimum the seat covers are not original to the
 bus.  
 
 can someone confirm this for me?  it is an early '63, but i can't see VW
 putting two different color seats in a deluxe.
