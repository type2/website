Subject: Re: [VB] I suck too! not really

OK. sooooooooooo it wasn't a vacuum leak.  The linkage adapter I had screwed 
up the linkage just enough to add about 800 rpm. didn't discover this till 
after the 2nd removal and 2nd different manifold and breaking my accel cable 
and lots of swearing.  So getting a new cable tomorrow and a new universal 
linkage adapter and some new gaskets.  Also I am starting the camper iterior 
rebuild soon. Has anyone replaced the 2 piece plywood flooring, under the 
vinyl flooring, with one big peice or has anyone cut it  different?
