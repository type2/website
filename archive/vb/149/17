Subject: Empty trailer from California to ?

I'm heading out to Monterey from Albuquerque next week
carrying a bus, and then going on to Familienfest
(unfortunately in a Ford tow vehicle w/ my trusty
trailer).

Does anyone need a bus brought from north or central
CA to Escondido or points east?  (Most of Arizona or
western New Mexico?)  Cost is fuel only!

See you in Escondido!
