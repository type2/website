Subject: re:camper bed

was writ:
"we can
use it to pattern off of and build us each a new interior from scratch.  We
will have to make some adjustments since his Sundial is a bench seat model,
and mine is a walk-thru."

I had drawn up most of the cabinets i built based on my ez-camper
reconstruction. I sent them into scott mcwilliams(i think) at www.sv2s.com
He was goint to post them there I never checked to find them. if you cant
find them there and need them, perhaps someone else may want to volunteer to
hold these on their site. I was originally trying to just post ot one site
to keep confusion down, but confusion is ok.
