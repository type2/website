Subject: Familienfest 8

Hi all...just wanted to remind everyone that didn't already 
know...Familienfest 8 is NEXT weekend. Saturday the 24th, in Escondido, CA. 
Day before Pomona, come on out and relax under the trees, on the grass. Have 
fun, get in a good swap, win some cool stuff in the raffle.

Hope to see you there!
