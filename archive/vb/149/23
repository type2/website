8-track recorders go from $10 to $50 on that auction site.  Not
quite sure where to get blank 8-tracks any more but you could tape
over ones you don't want or maybe load them with blank tape.  I
think it's the same size as open-reel tape but if you use open-reel
tape for an 8-track it probably won't last as long.

http://www.8trackheaven.com/index2.html has lots more.  There is
an interesting account of how these tapes were made at
http://www.8trackheaven.com/ampex.html , including pictures of
the vintage 1970 hardware at Ampex.
