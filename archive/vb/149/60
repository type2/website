Actually you can use the "American" wiring, and switch while running Euro tail
lights. All you need to do is run a seperate wire from the brake sender directly
to the brake light, instead of through the turn signal switch.

If you want to retain the stock setup I have an American '66-'67 switch I would
glady sell, trade, etc. to you.
