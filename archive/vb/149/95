Nothing was hot or knocking but is there any thing i should fear that could be damaged?

Well, a lot of those snake-oil salesmen drain the oil out of engines and
run them for long periods of time to prove how good their snake oil is.
What they don't tell you is that it works as well without the snake oil.

Put some oil in and fire it up.  If it isn't making funny noises, run it
for a few minutes and drain the oil.  If the oil comes out clear record
the karma withdrawel, fill the sump, and drive happy!
