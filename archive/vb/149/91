I am not sure on the slab part, but just wanted to remind you that steal
buildings are fine for shops and all but never store your restored veicle in
one. The problem with steel buildings is they sweat and condense durring hot
and cold weather. This will lead to damage to both you buses interior and
exterior. As a wood building absorbs this moisture.  Good luck on the new
home.

This may be slightly off topic. But I'll give it a shot anyway.

We bought a house in town and I've purchased a 24' X 24' metal 2 door
garage kit. Gotta put a slab in first. How deep will I need it to be?
Is 6" too much or will I need it to be that deep.

Working on a budget and not looking to build the ultimate shop or
anything. Just a home workshop.

p.s. This moving into town stuff is for the birds. Don't know how I
let my wife talk me into it. It was a late night discussion in
bed....if you know what I mean. Being a man sucks sometimes. Can't
think straight.
