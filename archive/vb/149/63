You _might_ be able to use a trailer tail light converter.  This is
designed for vehicles that have separate red brake lights and amber
turn signals to tow a trailer that has combined red brake/turn lights.

One end of the converter will have left/right/stop/tail/ground wires
and the other end will have left/right/tail/ground wires.  You'd wire
it in up under the dash - the left/right/stop end goes to the wires
at the turn signal switch and the left/right end goes to the wires
that go to the back for the lights.

This may not work 100% because these converters may depend on having
some more bulbs in the circuit to work.  I think they are doing some
funny things with sneak grounds and stuff but I have never sat down
and played with one enough to be sure.  Having the front turn signal
bulbs in the circuit _may_ be enough but I don't know for sure.

Yes, but you'll have to make a few changes.  Right now, your Bus has
four wires running from front to rear for the rear lights:
left stop/turn
right stop/turn
left tail
right tail/license plate

A Euro bus has five wires:
left/right stop
left turn
right turn
left tail
right tail/license plate

What you can do is wire the left tail light on your Bus to the right
tail light.  This frees up the former "left tail" wire, giving you
the extra wire that you need.  The functions of the wires on your
Bus will change like so:

was:                           is:
left stop/turn            -->  left turn
right stop/turn           -->  right turn
left tail                 -->  left/right stop 
right tail/license plate  -->  left tail/right tail/license plate
 
The only drawback to this is that you're one fuse away from not having
any rear illumination at night, so if you do this, make it a point to
check your tail lights from time to time.

If you want details on the exact hookup, post back and let us know.
