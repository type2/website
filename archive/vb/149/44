  I have had no problems or complaints on the new EMPI racks, I have sold 26
of them and only on 2 of them have there been any problems and that was just
a couple missing pieces, which EMPI promptly replaced.

Speaking of roof racks, is anyone using the new? roof rack made by EMPI? It
seems EMPI is trying to make parts of acceptable quality again.  I just
wonder if their rack is acceptable or just junk?   It is priced better than
the parts-is-parts rack, plus does not need modified to fit a double cab.
Also, years ago, I heard bad reviews of the PIP rack.  I assume they have
honed their craft as they are still selling them.
