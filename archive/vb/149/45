Thom's right. You can't take a formula for paint to any paint store and have them mix it and expect
to get the same results. This is because PPG base colors are a certain shade, Glasurit colors are a
different shade, etc.

If you have unlimited funds, Glasurit is your best bet to make an exact match to original because
their formula was the one used when the car was painted for the very first time.
