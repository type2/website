Subject: Re: [VB] Ellis' 1967 RFH Sold!

Wow,
	The "'67 Restoration From Hell" sold!!!!  This bus has been, like, 
a big part of our VW Bus List.  I say that the RFH has been a real list 
member!  I met Jim Ellis on-line back when he began the RFH.  I was 
living in a country in the South Pacific where the sheep out number 
people 10 to 1 and vw bus list members like Jim Ellis, Bob Hoover, Ron 
"Coyote", Dyer Lytle and many others were just so much fun to read.  I 
really cannot describe how amazing and weird it all was.  We did VW 
stuff in New Zealand but there was nothing to compare with the Arizona 
Bus Club meets or Martha's  engine case burns with the California 
Crazies (CCC's).   We all made instant friends with Charlie Ford when he 
wrote about the moment in his life, sitting in his undershorts, that he 
knew that he had to travel the US.  The Mother Ship found Charlie and he 
met everyone on the list.  We all rode in that vw bus with you Charlie!  
Don't start me on Grendal.   Ted keeps us all safe.  And the RFH?   Yes, 
I know this bus, part by part, from Jim's posts.  Really, Jim taught us 
all about how to restore a '67 Westy.  You should see my '67, looks like 
crap.
	The RFH is one fine bus because of the people who made it and used 
it.      That's the real story.  Good people, good list(s), and a great 
looking "Restoration From Hell"
