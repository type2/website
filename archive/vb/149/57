Subject: Turnsignal switch

Hello all.

I just bought a NOS turnsignal switch of the somba and it turns out that the 
switch is for european models and i need to get european tail lights if i 
want to use it.  has anyone come across this problem also?  does anyone know 
a way i can use the switch with out trying to get euro lights? finally, if i 
were to come across some euro lights can i use them in my bus with the 
american harness?
i dont really want to go through the trouble of trying to get my money back. 
  thanks in advance.
