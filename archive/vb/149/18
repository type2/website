Right.  You have the pin that is fixed to the body and that goes into
the end of the shift rod.  With that pin, your shift rod can't pitch,
yaw, side-to-side, or up-and-down.  It can only roll and move fore-and-aft.
With the earlier design, the shift rod can pitch, yaw, roll, fore-and-aft,
aside-to-side, and up-and-down.  Six degrees of freedom versus two...

>BE SURE to use anti-sieze grease

Does it have to be anti-sieze or will plain old grease work?  I have
both; just curious.

I don't think I had them the last time I pulled an engine but yes, they
would help.  There seem to be plenty of nuts on a VW that are designed
for a wrench - the clearances aren't enough to get a socket+ratchet
over the nut head.  The back bolt on the carb and the fuel pump are
two good examples.  They're also good for non-Bus applications where
you have a bolt too long to use a deep socket on but you still want
the ratchet action.   I have a set of 5 inch and 5 metric of these and
I use them a lot.
