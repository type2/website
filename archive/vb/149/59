How about this logic...

Say that you purchased this bus new in 1963 and two years down the road, the
headliner was ripped taking out a 2 X 4 from the lumber yard. Take to the VW
dealer to replace and no doubt a "new" German vinyl headliner would be
installed mid'60s style as per original VW specs.

However, with  Capri pants back in style this summer, shag carpet and/or
crushed velvet can't be too far behind if you want to be "hip".....
