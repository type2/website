Hi, 
  I saw the message below yesterday over on the type2 list. ( I lurk
there too : ) He doesn't mention split busses, but what fits a fat chick
should work maybe?......

Hey Everone,
I work at a roof rack store if you need racks I can hook you up at a good
price and free shipping even the bars.  I have put lots of racks on
vanagons bays and even a few Euro Vans, thule yakima or constuction
style.  If you have any questions give me a call or check the site.
Thanks
Kevin
