Subject: Ellis' 1967 RFH Sold!

Finally sold the infamous 1967 Westfalia RFH (restoration from hell) today.

Bought the thing on April 23, 1994 and sold August 16, 2002. Is currently
headed for the "far East". Say what you will but once again the buyer stepped
up and did the dirty deed.
Learned alot by doing that supposed restoration. Talk to Jon Furst or David
Mayes what a real restoration is all about. F that it's far easier to do a
"custom". What I mostly learned was how much there is to know, how many people
there are to know and how much I don't know. Weird thing about gaining
knowledge, exposure, involvement and having the b*lls to get out there and try
something. Those things will invariably teach you how much there is to learn,
what it's like to be an occassional target and how cool most of the people are.
F the people who arent. They come and go anyhow...
In the final analysis, I think that I prefer a bus that is mechanically sound
and visually a little tacky. Maybe I should say "appropriate for the swap
meets." That's where most of my friends are anyhow. 

Besides a mondo stress headache, acquired trying to get the deal into the can,
I am not sorry it is gone. A good bus that I will continue to publically
defend, gone to a good guy at a fair price.

Am I now out of the aircooled scene? Naw, now I gotta find me a rat bus and
sneak it into the budget. Maybe I'll win the AZ Bus Clubs' Raffle truck!
See you all parked in the swap meet area! (and dont dick up my paintjob or
you'll owe me a beer) =)
