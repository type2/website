Subject: Re: Slash rear bumper

Steve & Clara --

If you really want to change to a slash rear bumper, I'd be happy to trade
the one presently with my '67 Deluxe, since I should really have a pointy
one instead. Mine's a Deluxe bumper in good shape and lousy PO paint, and
right now it's totally diassembled in preparation for refinishing. I also
have a second "slash" blade with torched-out peashooter holes. Let me know.
I'm in the Phila. Pa. area, and I imagine shipping isn't cheap...

As long as we're talking bumpers, everyone, I'm looking for a good front
bumper "pipe" (aka towel rack); mine is totally dinged up and bent.

Are the repro bumpers the slash style? I can't tell from the catalog photos.
A while back there was a post asking about the quality of the repro bumpers,
and whether the various parts fit with the OG parts or not -- I never saw a
public reply. Has anyone had any experience with these?
