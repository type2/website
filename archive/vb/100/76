Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [WetWesties] Why VWoA protects its darn logo so fiercely

Just about every corporate giant whose logo is popular enough to be
copied is, and if not, should, be doing the same.  If I had three classic
Audi's and they wouldn't let me have an aftermarket logoed parts, nor
would they make them, I'm sure I'd avoid them too.  Like I stated, I'm
not boycotting VW.  I just don't like the sound of VWofA anymore, and
Audi doesn't bother me.  Japanese?  American?  Bite your tongue, you evil
man!  LOL  

Everyone who creates a product deserves to protect it, and I'm fine with
that.  If I created something, I sure don't want people copying it, and
in essence, saying I made it.  But if there was a following like we have
in the ACVW industry, I'd sure be the first in line to offer the parts. 
If I'm Apple and making Powerbooks, yeah, those old IIe's would embarrass
me, but if there was so many people out there that just wanted new IIe
covers, I'd sure make 'em.  Of course, I'm only an accountant, not a REAL
businessman.  Someone's making money making VW logoed mudflaps.  Why
isn't it VW?
