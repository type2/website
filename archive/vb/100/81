Subject: Re: [VB] Re: tent

I've seen Euro splittie SO42/44's with the earlier tents and brackets. 
There was a gentleman at OCTO (one before last) that was an original owner
of one he picked up and use in Europe before coming home.  It had a yellow
and gray privy tent but I've seen them with the full tents too.

BTW Most Euro campers were two tone painted and usually did not have the
crank out windows like the US or even the Tourist US versions did.   Usless
drivel I know.
