i've heard of some different problems through the local VW shop (very
knowledgeable guy). He got some info from another source so he checked the
case he had bought:

1. Distributor drive gear won't install correctly.

2. Dipstick is very hard to install

3. There's some green loctite somewhere in the oil galleys.

His case had all three problems.
