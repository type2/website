Finally! Someone else has discovered this nightmare
too! Restored is NOT original just as NOS is not REPO!
I have seen that term mis-used a million times, even
to the point where an award was given to a very nice
bus that won best original bus but was actually
restored. 
Perhaps the problem is that too many people left
school before they were ready!
