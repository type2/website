Hey well I have to pass the good karma token to Al Lalumia (incynr8), who
came through with the rear tin I needed for my '65.

I just got my mail tonight, and found that the speedometer I had bought from
Thomas Ainley had arrived!
It arrived in perfect condition, and packed VERY well.  Not just slapped in
a box, and shipped.
So, thank you Thomas, another good guy to deal with the whole buy/sell
thing.  Cant wait to see how fast (slow?) i'm going again in my bus again!
