Subject: Water hammer?

Hi people,
I just cleared out what I believe is called water hammer from my no. 1. After a
two day hiatus my engine wouldn't turn and looking at things before I pull the
motor; some water drizzled out of my right valve cover and the moter wouldn't
turn past about 30-40 degrees BTDC so I pulled spark plug no.1 and the motor
turned to a gushing sound and there was water on the plug. I spun the motor
several times then replaced the plug and after some coaxing fired up and runs as
before. Can anyone please tell me how this occurs? It was sitting outside, we
did have some real good wind and rain and it has Kadrons with gauze filters.
Thanks in advance for anything anyone can tell me.

Mike
