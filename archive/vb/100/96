Subject: RE: [VB] Halogen light conversion????

Interesting question that I have wondered over the years as well...

Will the H4 halogen kits drop into the bus/beetle headlight housings?

From what I have seen the el cheapos (about $25 each) are made in India, but
seem to be okay quality.  They drop into a lot of Porsche cars quite easily.
Automobile Atlanta always has them on display in their showroom...  Granted
I do not encourage anyone to patron that shop, so do not take my being there
as a plug for the joint.

So anyone dropped these in their bus or what?  Seems like a logical easy
upgrade to me!


Thanks,
