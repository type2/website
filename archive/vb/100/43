two things. my bus was running lesser than good, so 

i checked the ohm resistance in the spark plug wires, ends, dist. cap, and 


rotor, as the problem reminded me of my coil wire having too much 
resistance. 

the only problem was 2 of the wire ends being bad--one had 10k resistance, 
the 

other was cracked (but only had 5k resistance). so i put in a set of n.o.s. 
BERU 

wire ends with 0k ohm resistance. anyone know of a reason this (the 0k ohm 


resistance) could/would be bad for the ignition system?

 



 

also, wanna place bets on this? http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem

i'm guessing $2750
