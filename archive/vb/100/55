Subject: 63 singlecab page updated (Birth Cert)

I finally got around to scanning the Birth certificate that I ordered from 
The VW Museum at Wolfsburg last year. I have added it to my 63 singlecab page.
They were exceedingly friendly at the museum, and the birth certificate 
brings back great memories of the trip last year.
I now wish that I had photographed more things more carefully and documented 
better.
Next time I will try harder!
