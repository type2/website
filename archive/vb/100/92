Subject: Air Cleaner Question

I'm thinking of changing the air cleaner on my '65 from the foam kind to 
the oil-bath kind.  I've got a 1600cc engine (from a 71 bug, I believe) 
with a Solex 34 PICT-3 on it.  Can I put the old-style air cleaner on 
this?  Any recommendations or warnings?

mahalos,
chris
'65
