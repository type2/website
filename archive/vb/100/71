Subject: [VB] Brakes

 Well, 

I decided to take a look at my DC's brakes while she's out of commission.
Since I bought it I hadn't had time to look the whole truck over yet. So I
took of the left front wheel and there was all kinds of crud all over the
shoes.  The wheel cylinders had been leaking and the shoes were all falling
apart.  Also I discovered they were put on upside down and just barely
hanging on because they didn't quite fit into the recessed portion of the
backing plate.  So I got new shoes and wheel cylinder rebuild kits.  Which
brings me to my question.

My truck's vin says its production date is Jan '63 but the shoes that fit
are for trucks after like july '63, or so the shop says.  The front end
looks like it has grease built up on it since '63 so I would says its
original.  What's the story on these brakes?

Unfotunatley my DC doesn't run just yet, so where do I park my nonVW at
BYOB?  I'm planning on walking in for Kelley park.

Hey all of you planning to be in California in April!!!

	Just wanted to throw out a reminder about the BYOB (Bring your own
Bus) Bus
Show at The Red Barn, Saturday, April 6th!

	See details at http://www.redshift.com/~taylorvw/svt/

	SEE YOU THERE!


	Also, I got some recent details about Kelley Park the following
Sunday,
April 7th.  Based of the current situation, it looks like it's going to be
very packed again this year.   A new rule for the park, this year, NO CARS
ON THE GRASS!  This was mandated by Kelley Park, not by the Golden Gate
chapter.  ULP!  That means it will be similar to what was seen last year on
the 'rain/wet grass' plan.  Also, The lower parking lot will NOT be used for
the swap.  This was mandated by the City of San Jose, not by the Golden Gate
chapter.  Another, smaller area in the park is planned to be used along with
some of the (former) car show space.  They are working on both of these
issues and plans may change in a moments notice...hopefully for the better.
My suggestion is to get there early!

	More info about Kelley Park can be found at

Cheers!
