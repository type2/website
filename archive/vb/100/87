Subject: shift rod tube

Hi there, I've got a quick question. Is the shift rod tube welded to the
cross members that it passes through? I'm replacing the frontmost
crossmember, but don't want to remove the shift rod tube if it's welded to
all the good, non-rusty crossmembers. Anybody have some insight into how
this is done?

Thanks,
JesusV
