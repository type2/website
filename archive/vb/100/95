Subject: RE: [VB] Air Cleaner Question

I'm in the same boat with my '65:  1600 cc dual port with 34PICT-3 carb and
original air cleaner.  I suspect some jetting changes may be necessary.
Maybe E&B have some numbers for us.  Someone mentioned using the aircleaner
from a '71 bus too but I haven't heard anything specific about how you do
it.  I was thinking of just transplanting the intake snout from a '71
aircleaner onto a '65 style one to see what would happen.

I'm thinking of changing the air cleaner on my '65 from the foam kind to
the oil-bath kind.  I've got a 1600cc engine (from a 71 bug, I believe)
with a Solex 34 PICT-3 on it.  Can I put the old-style air cleaner on
this?  Any recommendations or warnings?
