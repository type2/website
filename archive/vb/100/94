Subject: [VB] Re: 15" Wheels

I stand corrected.

The 15" bus wheel is 4.5" wide.

The 14" bus wheel is 5.5" wide. 

Verified this at Dave Easterwood's house last night.  He had a set of each
nicely redone and powder coated waiting on completed busses to put them on
:)  Threw a measuring stick on them and that was that.

...  Granted you can still run 215/75/15s on them...  Just looks like BIG
tires :)
