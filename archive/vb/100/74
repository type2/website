Subject: Original, what does it mean?

Am I the one that's confused? On Everett's site there's a 1964 crew cab for
sale from Georgia.
The owner states: "It was restored about 8 years ago and garage kept since."
Then in the same paragraph he writes "It's all original and about as nice as
they come."
As far as I know, "restored" and "original" are contradictory terms.
Or has this changed since I left school?
