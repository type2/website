Subject: Having the right tool (was Cant get Tie Rod off)

A little over a week ago I entered a 5 hour death match with the removal of
the tie rods on my '67, and started this thread.  The advice from the group
was to go pick up a tie rod puller (aka pickle fork) which I did for $7 at
the local auto parts store.  At the time I really didnt want to spend $$ for
tools I probably would never use again (although somebody mentioned using it
to deter thugs from  breaking into the house; I could see it having some use
there <g>).  It worked and I finished the job.

I was hoping that the tie rods would fix a loose steering problem, but if
anything it was worse than before.  Yesterday I dropped the belly pan and
found that the drag link was shot as well.  I went down to the FLAPS and
coughed up some more money on a replacement (sigh), ready for yet another
death match.

Because I had the 'never to be used again' pickle fork, I was able to remove
the old part and had the new one on in about 30 minutes.  It is amazing what
a difference having the right tool will make, and I will never grumble (too
loud) again about buying specialty tools.

BTW the FLAPS had the drag link assembly for under $25.  It seems that they
had special ordered it about 10 years ago and the guy never picked it up.
The box was falling apart and it had a nasty layer of dust on top of it.  I
guess I can rationalize the cost of the pickle fork with a price break on
the replacement part.
