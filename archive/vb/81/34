Subject: For Sale: A/C for pre-71 Bus


All,

I am selling a brand new, never used, complete A/C setup for a pre-71 VW 
Bus.  I recently purchased the system from International Conditioning 
Enterprises (ICE - http://www.iceac.com), but need to sell it to make more 
room in the restoration budget for my splitty, which has suddenly shrunk.  
With some adaption, this kit could also be used in a Bug, Gia, or Thing.

Follow the link below to the eBay auction for the item.
