On page 54 of the '71-'73 _Without Guesswork_ manual, available at
http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/ , it shows the torque for
both "setscrew for torsion bars" and "locknut for setscrew" at
4.0 m-kg or 29 lb-ft.  These figures are for the later Buses --
the thread on the setscrew is M14x1.5.  If the setscrew on your
Bus is similar then this same rating would probably work for you.
