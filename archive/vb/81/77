Hi Frank,
We do not know about the product Ospho, but phosperic acid does not convert 
rust it removes it.  Other wise we agree the converter chemicals are a lame 
quickie fix like bondoing over rust.  Plus they will and do not offer the 
anode protection of zinc plating or high content primer.

We have found out the way to do it is to remove the rust with any of a 
mixture of wire wheeling, sanding, grinding and even blasting if need be.  
When at least the worse thick rust is removed we use phospheric acid or Naval 
Jelly (Which is a jelly form of phosperic acid.).  Once the rust is 
completely removed wipe off excess acid/Naval Jelly and let it dry.  Once dry 
lightly sand off the white haze which will react badly (Bubble!) with zinc 
primer.  We have heard using a body shop sheet metal degreaser will do the 
same to remove the excess acid also.  Using the phosperic acid removes rust 
in pores and even crevices of sheet metal where any other form of rust 
removal will not get into.

  You other option is Vari-Prime.  This is a zinc rich primer that also does

Cool!  We will have to look into it!  Thanks,  Eric&Barb
