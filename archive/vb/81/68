Bob,

You have a point, Splitties are problematic in freeway traffic.  I went
down to pick up a Bergmann Long Block between Xmas and New Years.  Went
straight down I-15 to Escondido in my Caravan.  I had never been on I-15
below San Berdu, . . . I grew up in Santa Fe Springs and left long
before they pushed the freeway all the way down to San Diego.  I was
really surprised at how hilly, almost mountainous it is between
Riverside and San Diego on I-15.  Definitely foreign territory for a
stock splittie.

It will be interesting to see how my 1835 with a progressive carb and
.044 heads performs over "Point of the Mountain" between Provo and Salt
Lake City.  My old stock '66 Bug single port did it in 3rd gear with two
people aboard.  I'll be happy if my 1835cc Splittie maintains 60 mph
over that stretch.  

Best,

Curt
