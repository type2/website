         I scored my little pocket blaster (looks like a strange ray gun) off 
the MAC truck.  It uses ceramic tips (Cheap & Easy to replace), is very easy 
to refill, and I think it holds maybe 2 lbs of sand and doesn't take a ton of 
air ( it's gravity feed-I think this helps ) One of the neater things about 
it, is the rubber boots that come with it.  These boots cover the tip and 
contain the sand, this allows you to spot blast very small areas, such spot 
welds and windshield channels with out fill your bus with sand.
         I've had other blasters, the Sears one with the 40 lb hopper 
(actually more of a plastic case with a strap for over your shoulder), 
Cambell Hausfield also has one, I actually think the both  blasters are made 
by the same company.  These use a carbide tip with  costs as much as the 
blaster!!!  These work well with say a 3.5 hp compressor.  But as I've said 
the tips are spendy.
         Bucket blasters usually sell for anywhere from $15 and up,  These 
like the Sears above is a suction feed, so they need more air.  They use a 
ceramic tip and have a rubber hose running down to a doubled walled metal 
tube.  The tube gets stuck in your  bucket of sand.   I've never had much 
luck with these.
         As to where to blast.  I'm lucky enough to have a very large back 
yard and I do enough favors (welding / blasting and such) for my neighbors 
that they don't really bug me.  I usually put down a trap and reclaim what 
sand I can.  On the bigger jobs I hang traps on the side of my porch roof in 
front of the workshop.  I do recommend a mask/resporatior and am kicking 
around finally buying a sand blaster hood next spring.  I'm hopping it will 
stop that "I just got back from the beach" feeling.  I like to use play sand 
on the larger jobs, it costs a bit more and is slower to cut, but is a lot 
nicer on the environment.  The real sand blasting sand (the green stuff) has 
nickel and other nasty stuff  in it.  
                                                                              
                       Peace,
