Subject: RE: [VB] Having the right tool (was Cant get Tie Rod off)

I had the same problem with the draglink when I adjusted it.  I tried to use 
a airhammer, and a pickle fork.  Niether of them worked.  I ened up doing 
what I would of if I had tried thinking for a few minutes before hand 
instead of going crazy.  You need to get a big socket and a nut (I think 
maybe 10mm) You then put the socket so that the threaded end of the draglink 
goes through the hole in socket,  then use an open ended wrench to back the 
nut off.  The nut endeds up pushing against the socket forcing the draglink 
to pop out.
This is a kind of homemade puller,  it might take a couple of tries to get 
it to work right, but it worked for me.

On the boot(which I messed up using the pickle fork), I looked far and wide 
and could not find one.  So I pirated one from a Renault tie rod end.  I 
fits pretty well and is a lot cheaper (free) then buying a new draglink just 
for the boot.

All in all, pickle fork bad!!!  Only use on stuff you are going to throw 
away.  Most mechanics I know do not use them anymore.

I hope this helps,
