Subject: Updating Transaxel ??

I have an early type 2 have  which has reduction boxes. I  can only go as 
fast as 50 -55 if I'm lucky.
I just want to cruise the freeway at 60-70 mph.  Is it possible?

Someone told me that I could replace my transaxel/reduction boxes with a 
later transaxel.
How can you convert an early type2 to have a later transaxle?  Is there a 
kit conversion out there.  What later year transaxle do you recommend?
