The main reason (don't get me started) is because it's my Bus and I can do what
I want with it!
The reason I didn't paint (and never will) my Single is because it looks so
damn food the way it is. I did the entire suspension, and motor, I guess you
call that "lowering", before I did anything else because I wanted a safe
vehicle I could drive not a pretty painted one with bad brakes and a sketchy
motor. After I did the "cleaning of the paint" I had the interior done in Red
Mesh, seen here.....

other cool tricks.

As for our cars (Californians) being low so we don't have to see the rust. My
truck although heavy with surface rust, is the straightest most solid
unrestored Single I have ever seen. Shouldn't judge a book by it's
cover.......................
