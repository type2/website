         I have an Oval Window Baja Bug (btw it's for sale, but not on E-bay) 
that the PO blasted and never did anything with.  I am also guilty of not 
doing anything with it, cept watching the surface rust.  The advantage with 
the Baja is the body is naked and off the pan.  If I do get around to getting 
rid of the rust, I'll use Murattice acid<way wrong<sg>.  Not only does it 
make most of the surface rust go bye bye, it also gives your metal a nice 
etch for holding primer.  The other good thing is, it will not remove as much 
metal as a second sand blasting. But I most warn, this stuff is acid (you 
won't see colors) but  it does burn skin, makes the bottom of your feet warm 
(great for concrete floors), if you breath it, you don't breath it for long, 
and it will screw up anything else it comes in contact with.  It's nasty 
stuff, but works wonders.     I'm sure there are lots of other and more 
expensive rust removal systems and who knows, maybe something better has come 
out on the market.   But Murattice acid cost 3 bucks a gallon at the lumber 
yard and will strip a part so clean it looks NEW, it can also be watered down 
and used as a mag wheel cleaner (non-clear coated), and makes a great 
pre-wash for greasy stuff.
         I've used this stuff for years without any problems, but I feel I 
must at this.  Use at your own RISK.  Please wear EYE PROTECTION.  You may 
want to experiment on junk parts and please if your mixing it for wheel 
cleaner, try it on an a non-seeable spot.  I might also ad that when placed 
in a spray bottle you must flush the pump part with water after every use.  I 
also urge you to keep this stuff and any other nastiness away from kids and 
pets.  And please, label this and any other product that is no longer in it's 
original container.
                                                                             
Peace,
