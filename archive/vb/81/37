The ad read: 

"it has typical front floor rust on both sides where replacement panels are
needed. The cargo floor is clean w/minor spotty surface rust bubbling up
the paint in places. Rockers are mostly solid but there is surface rust
which is a bit ugly in front of the rear wheel wells and the belly pans are
clean and solid. The cargo doors on both sides have a little rust in the
bottom of each and at least two of them will need some serious repair or
replacement." 

This guy belongs in politics with double speak like that.  The cargo floor
is clean WITH bubbling up paint????   Is that an oxymoron or what?  How do
you equate "a little rust" and "serious repair" in the same sentence??

Oh but wait it IS a 60.   Ronnie, I think I hear it calling your name ;-)
