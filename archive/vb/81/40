Subject: RE: [VB] throttle cable binding

Probably and PICT 31 on an adapter plate for an PICT 34 manifold flange.
Shouldn't have any affect on the cable. Bindng must be elsewhere. I run
adapter plates on 31-PICT all the time when I'm too lazy to rebuild a
34-PICT.

Hi All,

I just finished rebuilding the carb for the tipper and got it all mounted
back... when I went to start it up, I stepped on the gas pedal and it simply
stuck to the floor.  Everything is hooked up correctly... return spring and
everything.  I went to the back and nudged the linkage and it popped back
closed.   It appears that the cable is binding somehow in the tube that goes
through the fan shroud.... maybe because of the carb spacer that is for some
reason there which makes the cable go at too high of an angle?    Since the
tipper isn't in a lit garage, I decided to stop for the night, ask a
question or two and ponder it before I screwed something up....  It worked
fine before I took it off.

thoughts?
