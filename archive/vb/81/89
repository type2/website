Subject: RE: [VB] transaxle conversion

Oh boy the whole raising lowering issue!  :)

Basically the only kit I know of that converts to IRS while maintaining the
stock height is the Bus Boys IRS II kit.  Check out their webpage for
details.  It seems to be a large PITA to do just because the parts list is
massive and I think what they include in the kit is a little skimpy for the
price, but that is my opinion.  I am still trying to figure out if this kit
is a neat conversion or a waste of my time.  Granted if you have the parts
laying around I say give it a try, but if you pay a shop for all the parts
expect it to be $1000-1500 easily.  Let me stress that this is the only IRS
kit I have seen that will maintain stock height. 

Anything else I know of that goes to IRS or RGB eliminators lowers the bus
substantially.   :(

I think for your needs a "freeway flier" tranny might be the right way to
go.  Lets you keep the stock drive train and only requires a tranny swap
which is fairly easy.

Personally I do not mind going slowish because the busses handle like poop
unless you start "upgrading" parts.  I feel that front disc brakes, proper
"C" load tires and some anti-sway bars go a long way into making it a
reasonable interstate cruiser....  Add a little type 4 power and you can
actually keep up with traffic....  Note that the following thoughts are pure
talking trash since my bus is stock, for now.


Good Luck,
