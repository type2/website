Hi Steve,
The locking VW style shifters made today are unfortunitly junk.  They lock in 
nuetral or reverse.  As for all anti theft devices there is a way around 
them.  Some far easier than others though!  We have even heard of a fellow 
with a semi truck and attached fork lift that was lifting and carrying away 
very expensive sports cars in NY area.  For the most part you are trying to 
fluster and confuse the 95ish% of the thieves out there to abandon the idea 
of taking your ride.
