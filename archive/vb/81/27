Subject: One more note about torsion arms and measuring offset

Hi,

Make sure you get the torsion arms seated well (as far as they can go).

The first time I got the passenger side torsion arms on, the offset 
measured 4.125 mm. (insert the sound of doom here) Given that I was 
tired yesterday, I went back out today and reseated the upper torsion 
arm and now the offset is 5.5. (whew) I obviously didn't seat the top 
one well.

For me, the top torsion bars were difficult to remove and install. They 
fit much more tightly than the lowers. I don't know if this is common. I 
did find water in the passenger side upper torsion tube (clear, not 
rusty). The torsion seals were obviously loose (you could spin them) 
which is why i was replacing them.

(My bus was in an obvious accident sometime in its life (late 70's?), 
both front outriggers have a botched welding job, dogleg and door 
damage, etc. But the front end looks new enough that they must've 
replaced the whole front beam assembly, so I hoped for the best. Though 
after reading Muir's book I dreaded finding a wacky offset.)

BTW, if you are building a trailer queen I'd recommend having the front 
beam assembly removed, disassembled, and hot tanked.
