Subject: RE: [VB] transaxle conversion

I think with a tunnel trans complete from nose cone, you can drop it in,
with the 250mm brakes. I do believe shift rod stuff will be ok, but
experts can chime in here. 64-67 are the larger rgb, with less
reduction, that with a 3.88 4.12 or other r and p, you can go faster.
I have a 1600 sp 4.12 r and p and can do 60-65 without pushing on
195/75/14s, but I tend to drive about 52-62.

early type2s have reduction boxes and make the bus top line at 50 -55 if
you
are lucky.
How can you convert an early type2 to have a later transaxle?  Is there
a
kit conversion out there.  What later year transaxle do you recommend?
