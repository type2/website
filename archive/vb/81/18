OK for you folks that have been around Buses for some time.  A while =
back I asked about the difference in Decklid Latches between 66 and 67.  =
I ordered a new Engine Lid Latch and this one is to long also.  Witht he =
plate on the apron adjusted all the way back towards the engine the hook =
on the latch still "over shoots" the plate by about a half an inch.  The =
Decklid is from a 67 Bus and in good shape.  The apron came from a 66.  =
The latch that was on it before was a 2 part latch (66?) and the 67 =
Latch is one piece and the same length.  Would someone be willing to =
take some measurements of theirs?  I can post pictures of the two I have =
if someone can help from pictures.
