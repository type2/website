I couldn't agree more. That's exactly why I'm working on a HWY cruiser as a 
future project. Also why I ignore the "whys" I get when asking questions 
about how to get the old bus moving faster. After getting almost run down 
and pushed off the road with my 2 little kids in the back by a dump truck 
driver, I absolutly know WHY and don't bother to explain.
