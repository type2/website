Subject: raising of the crew cab

Hi List,
This past weekend a friend of mine and I took out the
lowered front beam that was in my 63 crew cab when I
bought it and replaced it with a 66 stock height beam.
When we set it back on it's feet, the front end is
considerably higher than the rear. It has been
converted to an IRS with a beetle tranny. Can someone
tell me if I can raise the rear to where my crew cab
will ride more level or am I going to have to replace
the tranny with something else. A guy that has a shop
close to here says he can put in a bus IRS and get it
close to the right height, but I would like to have
some input from the experts on the list. In addition,
with the taller tires (205-75-15's), it seems like
it's lacking power in 4th gear with my 1600 dp. Should
I try building a more powerful engine (I already own a
new set of dual carbs I haven't installed yet)and stay
with the bug tranny or should I think about changing
to a bus tranny and staying with the 1600? Also,
should I try running a 195/75-15 as opposed to the
205's??
Any input would be much appreciated.

Thanks,

3DPete
