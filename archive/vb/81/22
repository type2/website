I'm curious. I've got a '59 truck that I took ownership of in 
bare-metal. the PO sandblasted it, then decided it was too much work 
for him. He let it sit out and it got surface rust. I've owned it for 
at least 2 years and it's been sitting in the bare metal the whole 
time. Out here, stuff just doesn't rust unless it rains on it. I've 
got pictures of it when I got it and it hasn't changed enough to be 
able to tell from the pictures.

About 1/2 a year ago I pulled it out one day and sandblasted, then 
primed the nose. I havn't done it again mainly because it was more of 
a "bear" than I thought it would be. Seems trying to blast that light 
rusted "glaze" off of the metal is much harder than blasting paint.

I'd much rather use a rust converter and be done with it. Others have 
suggested that to me as well. So...will something likt the Vari-Prime 
actually do the trick? Or am I cursed to have to slowly sand blast 
this thing.

I need some real world feedback on rust converters. My truck will be 
on the resto-block here pretty quick. I'm supposed to do a "bang and 
bondo" job on it to get it on the road. Probably will end up with an 
upright T4 in it.

p.s. Once I start working on the truck, my '59 Kombi will be for sale.
