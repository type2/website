 Hi All,
 
 My insurance company is being a bunch of dumb a$$s and are requiring me to
 supply them with a written appraisal from someone that writes auto
 appraisals so I can insure my 67 tipper as an antique.  They refuse to
 accept my receipt and invoice for the amount paid.
 
 Any suggestions?
 
 
 Thanks
 David
