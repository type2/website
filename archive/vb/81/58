And to close the loop, where are all of these cars going? 
It doesn't appear to be show cars being stolen, so I'm guessing
the stolen bits are ending up on various people's cars and on
eb*y or other classified  outlets.   I know of a case in NorCal
a few years ago where someone found parts of their stolen bus 
at a swap meet.

Just like any other trend out of SoCal, this will probably
spread to NorCal as well.
