Hi Michael,
We are running a 3.875 R&P freeway flier with 1964-67 RGBs and 1641cc SP CW 
engine.  It will do 58 MPH with 205/75R15s on all four drums at 3,000 engine 
RPMs.  With larger rear tires (Up to 235/75R15s.) this speed can be increased 
at the same RPM, but we have the pre-late62 lower tighter rear wheel wells 
and 205s are as big as we can go in our 1960 walk thru panel camper 
conversion.  We can go over 70 MPH on flats, but as we have found out from 
experience, over heating engine oil temps, loss of engine longevity, and 
rotten MPG results from cruising at over 3,000 RPM.  If you do go to a later 
tranny with later RGBs you need to change out the front beam for a 1964-67 or 
preferably a 66-67 front beam with the bigger better brakes to keep the rear 
to front brake stopping ratio proper and prevent 180+ degree spins when panic 
braking.
  Someday we would like to try a 3.44 R&P tranny and get our cruising speed 
up to about 63-65 MPH.  At that speed it is possible to drive through places 
like Arizona where the rest of the traffic doing an average of 90 MPH on 
thier 70 MPH speed limit highways is in danger of running you over.
