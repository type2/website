Subject: RE: [VB] The new cal-look... was surface rust

Jason,... you must be referring to the distressed custom look.... all the
rage, simply take any beater bus, apply rust accelerator to the lower half,
wait a few weeks for some really BIG holes to appear and then slam it to the
ground so speed bumps tear off any loose pieces of rusty sheet metal that
are hangin too low.  :-)  If you were in Europe, you'd also want to cram a 3
liter porsche motor in it as well.

... before you do this however, remove all the original hardware and send it
up to me :-0

there a good reason for this? I'm not knocking anyone, just curious.
