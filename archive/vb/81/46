Adrian,
Have no idea where you are located, but up here in the PNW I use Jerry over
at Northwest Connecting Rods and no one else. He does all of my cases,
cranks, rods, heads, cams, and welding. He's located in Seattle.

-This is for an upright T4 conversion that will go into one of my early
busses. Can anyone recommend a good T4 head rebuilder? Mail order. OR A
vendor who sells non-junky new or rebuilt T4 heads. 

Hey Rex,

John at aircooled.net has brand new T4 heads from Remmelle (sp), but they
are pricey and I have no idea of the quality.  That is the only new heads I
know of.

As for quality used ones...  I have no idea really.  I have heard positive
comments about the AVP heads that Bus Depot sells, but in general think AVP
is a little too inexpensive to take the time to build a perfect head.  Never
heard a bad comment about Boston Bob.  Mark Stephens has a tendency to go
out of business too much so I am not sure if that is wise long term
investment there.  Probably RIMCO does a good job like usual, but never
heard a person testimony about it.

Also you may want to look locally.  There is a head shop near me that will
do seats for like $6 each...  But they are not VW guys so I am always wary
of the long term quality.  Then again the process of changing seats and
pressing them in is not rocket science :)

Any of the 914 shops will be happy to take your money as well and do it
right, but you will pay top dollar.  With this option you could get any
valve size imaginable as well if you want.  Then again once the bill is done
you could have just bought new Remmelle ones ;)

And in summary I do not know...


Good Luck,
