Exactly.  I don't think many - if any - question the
origin of the parts they buy.  Think about that when
you see a swap space with an entire car in pieces for sale.
I saw a bus like that once at one of the Vallejo shows -
you could have built the entire shell of a bus by standing the
pieces up.  All the same color. I asked him what happened to 
the bus for it to get cut up, he said it had been wrecked.  
Other than sawzall scratches, there wasn't a dent on it.
