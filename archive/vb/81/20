Ah, the subject of rust rears it's ugly head again.  Sanding/grinding is a no 
no for rust.  It can actually push the rust deeper into the metal.  Sand 
Blasting does a very nice job, if your set up for it.  (actually some of the 
smaller and cheaper pocket blasters do a damn good job, they sell for around 
$50, all you need is air and blasting sand ($6 per 100 lbs)).  Can't do that, 
then you might try some of the chemical rust removers, Naval Jelly and such.  
As for Ospho (Phosphoric Acid ) and other rust converters, their just that, 
converters.  They do not remove the rust, they change it a black iron oxide.  
Basically, doormat rust.  As long as the seal of black iron oxide is not 
broken the rust will stay dormant, as soon as air or moisture gets to it, it 
will start rusting again.  The other problem with Ospho is primer and paint 
compatibility.   You'll notice after Osphoing something you get that sorta 
white power off of it.  I've always had a fear of compatibility problems and 
have never risked a paint job to it.  You other option is Vari-Prime.  This 
is a zinc rich primer that also does the converting, like Ospho, but is 
compatible with most paint systems.  There are also some old school metal 
conditioners but I'm not up to digging up the old school books.  Hope this 
helps. 
                                                                              
             Peace,
