I've been hearing about this bus for a while in the 911
community, but nobody had any pix.  I wonder what that
thing weighs.  A stock 3.6L has about 250HP, chip and exhaust
will get you up to about 275.  In a straight line, he might
give my 911 run for it's money, but kiss it goodbye at the
first turn...
