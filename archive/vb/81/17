Subject: wiper blades??

hey there list! i'm curious to see if anyone knows where to get some
wiper blades like these...

i have stock blades for my year bus, but they don't fit on my wiper arms
which have a little button to press to release the blade as opposed to just
a screw hole. a previous owner must have switched the arm at some point.
any ideas?? 

thanks in advance.
