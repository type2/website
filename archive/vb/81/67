I guess then the problem really is, how do we know we are not buying parts
from a freind or a listees car. I was all excited about making some good
buys at the next meet, but now I don't know. How are we to tell? I'd hate to
buy some parts only to have someone at the next meet say "hey, wait a
minute, that's my stolen gate". What's one to do?

  One of the problems I see with the stolen car parts is that in the old
days you would see Joe Blow at a swap with a pile of parts off of 1 year of
car. Now it seems it's a lot of the perminate swap guys that are fencing the
stolen parts at the swaps because they have piles of used stuff. That is one
of the reasons I don't sell much used stuff at the swaps and am careful of
who I buy stuff from.
  A good example was we were at a swap and 2 different people found stolen
parts off of there own car at the same vendors spot. I guy had 2 deck lids
stolen and the other had an EMPI steering wheel stolen, both from different
areas, yet the same vendor had them for sale.
  As for Jon and Rachael's 67 bug, I'm sure we'll see parts off it at Pomona
in a couple weeks. I didn't see anything at the Copperstate that looked like
they may have come off of it.

And to close the loop, where are all of these cars going? 
It doesn't appear to be show cars being stolen, so I'm guessing
the stolen bits are ending up on various people's cars and on
eb*y or other classified  outlets.   I know of a case in NorCal
a few years ago where someone found parts of their stolen bus 
at a swap meet.

Just like any other trend out of SoCal, this will probably
spread to NorCal as well.
