Subject: Tranny swap & '67 gearing?

I'm considering doing a tranny swap on my '59 Kombi. It's got a big 
nut transaxle, but the actual transmission has issues. The nose cone 
is drippy and the tranny grinds going into second. It's done this the 
whole time I've owned the bus and has never got worse. I learned to 
drive "around" the problem. I let the engine wind all the way down in 
first gear before shifting to second. It won't grind then. But if I 
downshift into second, it will definatly grind. So I just don't do 
that unless I let bus come almost to a complete stop first. It hasn't 
been that big of a deal to me, but if I try to sell the bus in the 
future as is, it will chase some folks away.

I've got a tranny here that I got in a trade a few years ago. It's 
supposed to be from a '67 and supposed to be good...and I'm game for 
the trial and error swap (got more time than money right now) to find 
out.

So, do I have to remove the WHOLE transaxle to swap out? or can I 
just remove the transmission by itself. Either way, I'm keeping my 
current redux gear boxes since they work fine. And I'll go ahead and 
get new tranny mounts too.

Is a '67 tranny geared different from the other years? Just hoping 
I'll get a little taller gearset. Again, my bus already has a bignut 
transaxle...but I don't know what year it came from, or even if it's 
an actual bug transmission in the middle of it.

And as for my current transmission, I may look around and see if i 
can find a builder who can swap that syncro out so it won't grind 
going into second. There's supposed to be a guy a few hours from me 
that is great.

Hey, is there anywhere out there you can get good bus nosecones/hockeysticks?
