There's nothing like trying to double your investment? I think that was one
of those I have to have it and will never sell it deals. I will sell my 1960
rust free DC as is for 20,000 dollars, all you have to do is reinstall all
the suspension, wiring harness, brales, engine etc. a deal at half the price
