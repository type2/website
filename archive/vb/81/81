Pro thieves use tow trucks.  Alarms will only help if you are within
earshot, as people tend to ignore them due to excessive false alarms.
Lojack is better, and they claim a 90% recovery rate.  The trick is to get
to the vehicle before they disable the lojack or put the vehicle into a
metal building.

It would slow them down, but a pro will just winch it up onto his flatbed
and drive away.  Better to chain it (with a hefty chain) to something
substantial, or just to put it up on blocks and store the wheels
elsewhere.

Practically, in a parking lot, a club on the steering wheel with the
wheels turned fully right or left will discourage a tow-truck equipped
thief, as they cannot tow the car out of the space without it hitting
adjacent cars.

Of course, there is the classic Doberman on a long chain.
