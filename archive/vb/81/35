    It's owned by a friend of mine. I used to own it, I actually had to =
buy it in a package deal to get my dream bus(low rust og 57 deluxe) =
along with 4 single cabs, 2 kombis, a standard turned church bus, and a =
panel. no buying just the one. all or none. It came from one of those =
old vw guys you always hear about with yard full of rusting vw's and =
none of them for sale, except this time he sold them. I would have kept =
the dd too, but I went heavily into debt to buy them all and was offered =
$8,000 for it by the person now selling it for $15,000. I was sort of =
made to feel like I ripped him off for some time after I sold it to him, =
even though he saw it in person, Offered to pay the price and I sold it =
on payments. So I kind of have a sore spot about the whole thing now.  =
But in all fairness he did wash it real well, and thats gotta be worth a =
few grand;-) =20
        The bus itself isn't bad, It does have rust, but not as bad as =
alot of people who haven't seen it in person say it has.
