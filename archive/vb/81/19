Subject: re:surface rust

i woiuld try POR-15, or Corroless. corroless is available from eastwood, and
por-15-i forget, but it should show up in a simple web search.

i think in the type-2 library there is a great article posted by a member on
how they wennuts on their bus rustprrofing and soundproofing....
