As I've mentioned before, safety is the prime
consideration I have.  My over-the-road '61 Westy is
set up to do the speed limit (at least on the level
road).  Also it's a lot more pleasant to listen to the
truckers admire my bus on the CB than have them run me
over and cuss about me being in their way.  

I drive from Albuquerque to California several times a
year, not to mention how often I go to Arizona,
Colorado, etc. for shows, and I feel it's not safe to
travel too much slower than traffic.  Too great a
speed differential is the one of the most common
causes of accidents!
