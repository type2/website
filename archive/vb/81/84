Subject: appraisal

Hi All,

My insurance company is being a bunch of dumb a$$s and are requiring me to
supply them with a written appraisal from someone that writes auto
appraisals so I can insure my 67 tipper as an antique.  They refuse to
accept my receipt and invoice for the amount paid.

Any suggestions?


Thanks
David
