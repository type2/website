Subject: RE: [VB] Stolen VW's

all those are good ideas, but a thief who wants the car will get it.
Harry in fresno (thanks for all the help!!!) provided me with this task
force in so-cal:  http://www.ocatt.org/
they seem to have their $h!t together, and were more help than the actual
police have been. i would STRONGLY suggest that ANY suspicious activity you
might see around our old vw's be reported to them. from what i gathered by
talking to ocatt was that they work directly with the police somehow (see
their website) and have regular meetings with the police concerning stolen
cars, not just vw's.  the guy i talked to, last name Skipper, seemed to
know about vw's, more than just the usual "what's the color and vin number"
B.S. i got from the police.
i've spent alot of time on the phone and the net concerning rachel's bug
being stolen. thanks again to all who have helped us and have helped to
spread the word. hopefully something positive will come about from it all.
another thing i have learned is to MAKE SURE your vehicle is covered for
theft under your insurance policy, and that any contents you may have
inside are also covered. 
thanks again,
 jon and rachel
