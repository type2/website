Call Ronnie at OldVolks/Type 2 parts and order a Freeway Flyer tranny.  My
FF has a 3.88 R&P and WITH reduction boxes, I have had it up to 81-82 miles
per hour.  I am running a 1600DP and the ~81 MPH was going down hill, but it
is very possible with RGB's.

I have an early type 2 have  which has reduction boxes. I  can only go as
fast as 50 -55 if I'm lucky.
I just want to cruise the freeway at 60-70 mph.  Is it possible?

Someone told me that I could replace my transaxel/reduction boxes with a
later transaxel.
How can you convert an early type2 to have a later transaxle?  Is there a
kit conversion out there.  What later year transaxle do you recommend?
