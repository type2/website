Yeah, I think if you look at the specs for the vintage busses, they have
governors put in to keep the speeds below 60-65.  I read this as they aren't
meant to go faster for a reason.  Things do tend to get a little weird at 80
but 65-70 I am comfortable with.  I have driven thousands of miles at this
speed in my '65 and am comfortable with it.

Well, to misquote Ralph Nader, my SC is scarry at any speed ! I've had it up
to 65 before but it sounds and feels right around 57, according to the
spedo, which now has a broken cable!

Call Ronnie at OldVolks/Type 2 parts and order a Freeway Flyer tranny.  My
FF has a 3.88 R&P and WITH reduction boxes, I have had it up to 81-82 miles
per hour.  I am running a 1600DP and the ~81 MPH was going down hill, but it
is very possible with RGB's.

I have an early type 2 have  which has reduction boxes. I  can only go as
fast as 50 -55 if I'm lucky.
I just want to cruise the freeway at 60-70 mph.  Is it possible?

Someone told me that I could replace my transaxel/reduction boxes with a
later transaxel.
How can you convert an early type2 to have a later transaxle?  Is there a
kit conversion out there.  What later year transaxle do you recommend?
