Tom,

They are still widely available at extreme varying prices.

At least it appears that way based on several vendors online catalogs.

Rebuilt from $89.95 to new at $269.....

When it gets really bad, I'll dig out my cache of old engines/heads and 
start selling them off.  Sure am glad I didn't start throwing them away.

Cheers, dave
