That's exactly what I did back in the resto. My tubes  (pipes) were new
along with the repro verticals; my blade is original 67. I filled the
pipes up with metal-ready (POR), then rinsed them out and dried them, then
filled the pipes with POR15, shook'em for a bit, then poured it out, and
used it to coat the inside surfaces of the verticals and the blades,
already prepped.

Lots of rain in the last ten years, no rust, at all. Bumpers look new.
