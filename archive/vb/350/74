Hi tomaboyd,
Problem is you will just add two more areas that water and rust can get into 
the shift rod tube.  Plus the exposed shift rod tube will all too easily rust. 
 Just do it right and pull the engine and tranny.  While the tranny is out 
drill and tap the RGB mounting holes deeper.  so you can install 40% longer 
bolts.
