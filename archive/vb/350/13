Ya, I got a pair of new SP heads when they were $125  (the DP were  $105 ) 
because I was happy they were available new suddenly.  Haven't had  to price the 
stuff recently, but check a bunch of places... prices do  vary.

Tom,

They are still widely available at extreme varying  prices.

At least it appears that way based on several vendors online  catalogs.

Rebuilt from $89.95 to new at $269.....

When it gets  really bad, I'll dig out my cache of old engines/heads and 
start selling  them off.  Sure am glad I didn't start throwing them away.

Cheers,  dave
