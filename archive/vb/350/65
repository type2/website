Subject: Big Nut to Freeway Flyer

greetings... its been a while since ive posted, but i have a tranny related 
question. i currently have a '66 with a stock 1500sp and a small nut tranny. 
runs smooth and quiet and shifts nice.

BUT, i am finally tired of cruising at 52 mph and my club members leaving me 
in their dust on roadtrips. i have a big nut tranny drum to drum in my 
garage. been sitting for 5 years. what would i need to turn this into a 
freeway flier? and where can i source the parts?

additional thought i had... can i put the big nut axles and redux boxes on 
the small nut tranny?

thanks,
Bob Margiotti
