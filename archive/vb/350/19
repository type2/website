Subject: Re: [VB] '64 driver side door handle

if you have an early 64 with the pull handle, you can used mid 61 through  
early 64 handles.
yes the drivers side should lock.
the early 64 only T series handles to match one key for everything is  pretty 
rare.
 
if you have a push button door, you can use 64 1/3 - 68 push button  handles. 
  64 1/3 - 66 handles take the T key for the one key fits all  concept.
 
lube up the door mechanism.

I'm in  need of an exterior driver side door handle for my '64.  The old  one
recently snapped off when an inexperienced hand tried to open the  door.  Did
they ever make a locking style for this particular type of  handle?
