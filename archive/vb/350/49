Subject: Re: [VB] Brake size

for the most part the 1 ton will have a 46 mm axle nut in the rear, and the
dust cap on the front drum will have a lip to pry it off. 63 and earlier 3/4
ton has no lip on the dust cap and a 36mm axle nut.
i don't how or if any of this applies to 63 only optional 1 ton brakes.
