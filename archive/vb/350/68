Subject: re:master cylinder

I just noticed some recommendations of switching to a dual circuit master
cylinder. Looks like cip1 has a kit for this conversion, and eric & barb
have details in the library.

Seems like this is definitely the safer way to go. Will all this fit under
the splash pan? Will using a rabbit reservois still fit in the bus without
any alterations?

Thanks again for some suggestions on this...
