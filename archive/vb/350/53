The only problem was that the valve seats shifted causing a loss of 
compression in 1 cylinder. The engine had only 30,000 miles since it was rebuilt. I 
know this will lower the horsepower but to me it would be worth it if it makes 
the engine last longer. What do you think about this plan? Any thing else I 
should consider?
Hi Dave,
You really should figure up the compression ratio and keep it 7.1:1 or a bit 
lower.  Just stuffing shims in, is just guessing.
  As for the valve seat shifting that would not be affected so much by CR, 
but temp driven.  Aluminum expands faster than steel when heated.  So if the 
engine is heated too much the bore in the aluminum head expands enough to allow 
the steel valve seat to shift around damaging/expanding the bore in the head.  
  Also cracking of the heads can be to too high of CR, but could be from 
being driven too high of engine temp.  Then you stop suddenly, shut off the engine 
and the heads cool unevenly and crack.
  To prevent overheating we would suggest installing an oil temp gauge, oil 
pressure gauge.  Never let the oil temp go above 220F and preferable keep temp 
between 160-210F.
  Good idea to tach engine and find out where 1,500 and 3,000 RPM in in 2-4th 
gears and where 3,000 RPM is in first.  Using these RPM ranges, never going 
below 1,500 and for only very short periods above 3,000 RPM we have doubled our 
engine lifespans between rebuilds.
  The 1972-79 bus engine when the national speed limit was 55 MPH the engine 
lifespan if maintained properly was well above 200,000 miles and could hit 
300,000.  Since the national speed limit is anywhere up to 70 MPH now these 
engines are having much more problems and more often than not need a serious repair 
or rebuilding in the first 100,000 miles....
