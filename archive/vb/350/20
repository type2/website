Subject: Re: [VB] '64 driver side door handle

on the pull handle doors, the passenger side should have no key, but  
locks/unlocks  from the inside.
 
the drivers side should not have the "lock from the inside" door mechanism  
(or you could lock yourself out by accident) but should have the key on the  
handle.
 
FYI, the lock from the inside and the lock on the handle are two different  
things for the pull handle doors, so a key won't help you if it's locked on  
the inside.
