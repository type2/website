Subject: RE: keys for a 65

You've gotten correct info that the keys should be the same.  We frequently 
see, howver, an aftermarket ignition installed that does not even use a VW 
key, so it's impossible to key alike.  We frequently will, then, key all the 
doors alike with a T series key, and leave the ignition using it's seperate 
key.  Feel free to email if further information is required.
