I put some 4" mid-tweeters in the doors, high up, flush mounted.  There's  
a recess below the ventwing that is perfect for this:

stereo separation.

Bass and rear sound in general comes from 6x9 triaxials mounted under the  
z-bed (homemade box with original hardware):

Powered by a 40W 7-band eq/amp/fader and a $5 garage-sale head unit.  I  
have no problem hearing it at highway speeds.
