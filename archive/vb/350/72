Hi Bob,
You need to source parts by contacting a reputible tranny rebuilder.  Have 
the shop rebuild your tranny center section to a FF tranny, and you rebuild and 
install the axles and RGBs.
  Yes you can install big nut axles on small nut tranny.  You will increase 
your top MPH at same RPM by three or less MPH.
