There's a couple of shells near here. One at Riley's Muffler in
Corning. One is at a private junkyard in Red Bluff, and there is a

 Hello everyone I am looking for a passenger door for my 65 deluxe. The one I
 have now is in bad shape. I live in Central California and wouldn't mind
 driving a few miles or paying for shipping. I just need a door without the
 glass and frame on top.
