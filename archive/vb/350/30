Hi Jamie,
You should check out the wiring diagram for your year and Euro or N. American 
type bus (-at-):

The relay should be wired with three wires. It does show a ground, which 
would probably be the relay mounting.  Depending on the year of the relay the 
mounting changed, first screwed to the fuse box bracket, then the relay had a 
screw in its top to go into the body just below the package tray, then a mounting 
bracket that the relay sprung loaded into and for the 1966-67 had a two year 
only mounting bracket that the relay again was screwed to.   
  In our 1960-63 buses we have not needed a grounding of the relay through a 
bracket and have just hung the relay down by the wires.
