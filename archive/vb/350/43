Subject: keys for a 65

just an update, 
pulled the cargo door handle and took it to my friendly local locksmith,  yes 
it was "T" code
 
He has a blank ,cut it to code, was amazed it was 2 sided.....and it  worked, 
 
Came home , put it in the ignition and it fits !   YEAH
 
now to drain the gas tank + change the oil and see if this beast will start  
up after sitting 20 years......
