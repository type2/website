Subject: Stranded bay-north of Ukiah

Hello, my name is Gene Cornelius, and I was heading home from Santa
Rosa....going up the grade on 101 from Ukiah to Willits I saw a baywindow
bus on the southbound side of the freeway, with people hanging around it
with a sign.  I drove up the hill and turned around, thinking they just
would need gas or something.

However, their problem was more major, and much more unusual....a stub axle
broken off where the threads start.  I called all my resources, but could
not come up with a stub axle for a '70 bus (right side).  Anyway, I helped
them get it off, and gave them instructions on what to do if/when they got a
replacement.  The bearing assembly and CV jopint have not been
dissassembled....just the CV joint removed so as to get the stub axle out.

They need a stub axle, probably some grease, and an axle nut.  Their nut is
good, but they might not be able to get it off the broken part without a
vice.  I left them with my 6mm Allen wrench, the axle nut pounding tool, and
a used cotter pin.  I do believe that they would be able to get backlon the
road safely if they get their axle!

They have been living/camping in their bus (there are three of them...middle
aged hippies, very nice, not insane or dangerous or weird.)  Sorry, they
have a cell phone but no reception.  And I forgot their names, being more
focused on the problem.

If you can help them, please do, and let me know how it came out.  If not,
maybe you know of someone who can?

Please forward this message to any and all who might be able to help!

Thanks,
