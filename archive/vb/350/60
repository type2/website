Thanks Sean,

I forgot about the water. My bus has been in my garage for so long that it has
dried out. I should be able to hang some plastic inside the door to minimize
that problem. Anyway, since the bus has been so nicely restored by ISP West, I
don't think that I will ever drive it in the rain.
