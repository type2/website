You can make a good shock either oil-filled or gas-charged. Generally an
oil-filled shock will have a bit of a less harsh ride, and many people
prefer this. A lot of people buy KYB gas shocks because they're cheap, and
they're not bad for the price. But I think if you compared them to a high
quality oil-filled shock you'd find that the oil-filled shock can give you
comparable handling plus a more comfortable ride. (While we do sell a lot of
KYB's, we also do get some complaints about their hard ride.)

The Boges were original equipment on busses, but the ones currently sold for
splitties don't compare to the ones that Boge supplied to the Volkswagen
factory when your bus was new. (For one thing, they're Mexican made now.)
The AlKo's, however, are still European made, and are a much beefier shock
than the current-production Boge shocks. If you look at them side by side
the difference is unmistakable. For hardly more than a pair of KYB's, I'd
have to say that the AlKo's are the best shock for the money by far. I
started carrying them on the advice of Just Kampers in the U.K., who had
been selling them for '68-up busses for a long time and really liked them.
I've been carrying them for a couple of years now and have had the same
customer response that Just Kampers did. People love them. I get positive
emails all the time.  You can find a few of them in the Type2 and Vanagon
list archives. It has been like pulling teeth to get their Splitty shocks
(although I do have them now), so not too many Splitty owners in the U.S.
have been able to get them  Therefore you won't find many user reports among
splitty owners, only because there aren't as many of them out in the field.
But if you read the positive reviews that later Bus and also Vanagon owners
have given them, it's basically the same shock.

Even better than the AlKo's - and in my opinion the best shock available for
a splitty - is the Koni. Also an oil-filled shock, it is actually
user-adjustable upon installation. You can literally "dial in" the ride
firmness (rebound) upon installation. This means that you can adjust it to
your taste, and also as it wears over time (all shocks get softer over time)
you can compensate by dialing it back up.  The bad news is that they're more
than twice the price of the AlKo's. But they're literally the last shock
you'll ever have to buy.

So my recommendation is the Alko's if you're on a budget and the Koni's if
you're not.
