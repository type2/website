Hi  Bob,
You need to source parts by contacting a reputible tranny  rebuilder.  Have 
the shop rebuild your tranny center section to a FF  tranny, and you rebuild 
and 
install the axles and RGBs.
Yes you  can install big nut axles on small nut tranny.  You will increase  
your top MPH at same RPM by three or less  MPH.
Eric&Barb

if his top speed was 52...
 
52x1.39 (remove small nut RGBs) / 1.26(add big nut RGBs)= 57.37  
 
yields a tad more than 5 mph more at the same rpms.
