I will put a pic up onto vintage bus this weekend. Look in Stand By Your Bus.
And yes, I am The Steering Man. The story on the steering wheels is that my
personal life and my engineering business have been too full to pay attention
to the steering wheels. I still have the mold and it is almost converted from
a foam process to a cast urethane process. If things settle down this year, I
will pop out a few more. I think the cast urethane will be even better.

  Chris,

   I have a speaker mounted in my dash, using the factory speaker holder and
since I have a westy I have 2 6x9's in boxes under the rear Z-Bed.
   I have seen people put them under the dash (in boxes) or in the kick panels
as well.

   I'm guessing you are the same Chris that used to make steering wheels. Am I
right? Anyway, do you have any pics of your bus?
