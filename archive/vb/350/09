Subject: need a passenger door

Hello everyone I am looking for a passenger door for my 65 deluxe. The one I
have now is in bad shape. I live in Central California and wouldn't mind
driving a few miles or paying for shipping. I just need a door without the
glass and frame on top.
 
 
 
Thanks,
Eric
