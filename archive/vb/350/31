You should have three wires at the turn signal flasher.  One is the
power from the ignition switch (black/white stripe).  One is the pulses
to the turn signal switch (black/green/white).  One is for the indicator
light in the speedometer (blue/white).

First thing to try: Connect the black/white and black/green/white wires
directly to one another - no flasher involved.  Turn the ignition on,
and work the turn signals.  As you flip the turn signal lever, the turn
signals on that side of the Bus should come on steadily.  The indicator
in the speedometer will not come on.  Make sure in the back that you're
seeing the bright filament of the bulb.  Also, try it with the running
lights on.  If your rear lights do funky things, fix the grounds at the
rear lights.  If you can't get the turn signal lights (front or rear) to
come on at all, suspect a fuse or the turn signal switch.

Assuming the above checks out, and assuming you have a generic two-prong
non-electronic flasher, it should have a terminal labeled X and a
terminal labeled L.  Connect the black/white wire to terminal X and the
black/green/white wire to terminal L.  Turn on the ignition, work the
turn signals, and they should flash.  The indicator in the speedometer
will not flash.

To get the indicator working, connect it (blue/white) to L along with
the black/green/white wire.  It will flash out of phase with the
exterior lights.

The original flasher had to, in order to provide a ground for the
indicator light circuit.  With the indicator circuit separate from the
exterior light circuit, the indicator would fail to light if an exterior
bulb was burned out, warning you.  Depending on the generic 12 V flasher
you use, wiring it per the above may or may not cancel the indicator
when an exterior bulb is burned out.  Most likely, the 12 V flasher will
flash much faster than usual or not at all when an exterior bulb is
burned out.
