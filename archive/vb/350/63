He has a blank ,cut it to  code, was amazed it was 2 sided.....and it  
worked, 

Came home ,  put it in the ignition and it fits !   YEAH

you should think about pulling the drain nut/spout off the tank and

10 minutes of idling.    I changed it again.   and  again as soon as it got 
dirty (drove to the store and back ~ 4 miles)... and  again 40 miles later 
(dirty) ... and... then ~200 later it was  dirty...and...
