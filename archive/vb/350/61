for the  most part the 1 ton will have a 46 mm axle nut in the rear, and the

i don't how or if any of  this applies to 63 only optional 1 ton brakes.

63 1 ton front brakes have the lipped dust cap and take the same brakes  & 
front wheel bearings as 64-67. 
 thus lips in front = 64-67(1 ton) front brakes lipless = 55-63  (3/4) front 
brakes.
 
63 1 ton rear brakes take a 36mm axle nut, but use unique drums, and the  
64-67 rear shoes, 55-67 use the same rear rear cylinders.
