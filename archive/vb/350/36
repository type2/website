Subject: RE: [VB] keys for a 65 bus ?

I have a '65 also. I started with no keys at all except an ignition key
and my passenger side lock had been punched like yours. Now I have one
key for the ignition, one for the driver's door, one key for the double
doors and one key that fits both the passenger and rear hatch. It's a
real pain, but apparently they cannot all be keyed the same. It's
probably because they had been changed out over the years.

I ended up taking all my locks to a locksmith, along with some other
handles that I picked up on Ebay, and they were able to piece them all
together and get me as well-keyed as I am now.

Somebody else may chime in with a better answer.

Good luck,

slojason
