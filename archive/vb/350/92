Subject: Re: [VB] slash bumpers

Actually - someone did respond directly - I decided against the repro 
stuff - the problem with my og overriders was that they are rusty inside and 
when they were painted and stuff before they kept rusting in the tubes and 
rust ran down onto the blades. I figure what I'll try is cleaning out the 
tubes with a wire brush - maybe rinse em with lacquer thinner then use the 
por-15 products - then por-15 inside with ... maybe just a rag on a 
coat-hanger or something.  I'll por all of the parts in the inside - then 
put em together - then prime and paint.

I mentioned some sort of rubber seal between where the parts meet - because 
I thought I say that somewhere - maybe the WW site - I dunno?

Thanks for responding.
