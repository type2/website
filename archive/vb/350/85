Hi Bob,
Your 1500SP will push it along.  You just might not be as happy with the hill 
climbing ability.  Here in hilly W. Washington State we have been running our 
1963 SC with big bore 40 HP engine and 3.88 R&P FF large nut tranny.  It does 
have much less hill climbing abilty, but gets there.  Doing the run between 
Olympia and N. Seattle areas with the FF tranny we have shaved off about 15 
minutes on the 80+ mile trip due to being able to do at 3,000 RPM (-at-) 58 MPH, 
instead of 53 MPH with bigger rear tires with the original geared 1960-63 small nut 
tranny.

  Dual carbs will only really increase HP in a much higher RPM range.  For 
more torque to get off the stop line and/or uphills without slowing down so 
much, you will need more torque.  We would suggest you try out the FF tranny and 
see how you feel about the hill climbing.  Your 1500cc should have a 69mm 
stroke crank instead of the 64mm stroke (20, 25, 36, bastard engine, and 40 HP 
cranks) which has more torque which is what gets a bus up hills faster.  Then you 
can decide if the 1500cc SP you have will work for you or if you need to build 
up a 1600, 1641, 1688, 1776, or even perhaps bigger engine.

  We are still running our 1641 SP with CW crank (now over 60,000 trouble 
free hard miles) in our 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion with 3.875 R&P FF 
large nut tranny and love it.  We like to try 1600 P&Cs with a 72 or 74 mm CW 
crank and then perhaps a 3.44 R&P FF tranny to get in mid 60 MPH range doing 
3,000 RPM.
