Hi Folks,
I'm trying to get the electrics working on my '60 DD.  I switched all 
bubs, but I am having trouble with the turn signals.  The '60 wiring is 
very basic but I must be missing something.  There are two wires tha 
hook up to the relay. one from the fuse box and the other from the turn 
signal switch.  I tried to use a 12 volt 2 prong relay but did not have 
any luck.  It looks like from the wiring diagram that the relay needs to 
be grounded.  Any suggestions?  Thanks.
