Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch cable

It is normal to have to adjust the clutch after replacing it.
 
But if the pedal does not spring all the way up, either the spring is  
gone/broken/not in place right... look at the clutch arm out the side of the  
transmission... there is a spring around the arm...  the arm the clutch  able goes 
through.
 
but usually what happens is the clutch pedal pivoting getting rusty/crudded  
up.   then you need to remove the pedal from the arm under neath (13mm  nut 
and bolt) and then remove the clutch pivot... think a large bolt is under  then, 
clean it up, apply fresh clean grease, and reinstall.

you might want to do the brake pedal pivot too.

I  replaced my clutch recently, 

and now the clutch wasn't taking at the  right place,

it seemed to "fall" off the Clutch pedal( it used to take  low down on the
pedal, 

and now it was at the very top, the engine  was revving whilst in gear) , 

So I made the cable shorter to try and  fix this problem, but now

The clutch pedal comes up, and I have to  assisted with my foot to help is to
the top, 

I Think It might be  springs or something, Please Help
