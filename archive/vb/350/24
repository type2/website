So ... I got to paint an ol' fiberglass top.  I hear that marine paint is 
good - but what about primer - necessary - what kinda is best etc??
Hi John,
If one applies a paint for metal then a primer to coat the metal first is the 
way to go.  So if you are going to apply a marine fiberglass paint, one 
should apply first a marine fiberglass primer.
