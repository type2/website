To all,

I would like to recommend Steve at  HYPERLINK
"http://www.steveslockshop.com" http://www.steveslockshop.com. I emailed
him looking for help after he replied to Oldscholvw's problem with locks
on his '65 bus. While Steve was unable to resolve my problem of too many
keys (not his fault), he was extremely helpful, informative and timely
in his correspondence. That's the kind of service you recommend to
friends and return for.
