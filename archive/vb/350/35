Hi Oldscholvw,
Since 1955 all VWs used one key for all the doors and ignition switch.  If 
the ignition works (should be a "T" series key and locks) you should contact one 
of the several VW specialty locksmiths availible through this list and 
advertising on Thesamba.com.  One of them should be able to fix your door handles or 
be able to rekey replacement ones to match your ignition switch.
