Subject: Re: [VB] RE: keys for a 65

the 66 & earlier steering locks use a unique key profile, same a bug  
steering lock keys.  this kind has the words on the tumbler. fahrt  start etc.  Thus 
my 65 w/ og steering lock has one key for  ignition, another for the doors.
 
if you find a 67 steering lock, it takes an L series key,  like the rest of 
your bus.  you would then need to get the rest of your  locks re-keyed to match 
the new ignition key.  Unless you were really  lucky and found one that was 
already matched.  no words where key goes  in.
 
both the 66 earlier and the 67 steering locks fit in the bus the  same.

I have a 67 sliding door samba  I was hoping to get a steering column  lock 
matched to my other key.  Is it not possible?  Mike
