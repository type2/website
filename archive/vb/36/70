Hi All,

Well, today my quest is a few nice pieces of heater duct tube fabric and
some of the band clamps that secure it... the ones that have the metal band
and then the clasp that is a small square metal piece and another that looks
like a cotter key... I can live without the metal band but they really
aren't that hard to remove in one piece with a little patience.

My main focus is the long section of heater duct fabric.

Thanks much in advance.
