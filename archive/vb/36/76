Hi Staffan,
Best to just take off all four cylinders and replace the paper gaskets with 
new ones you have finger painted with silicon high temp sealant.  Otherwise 
you probably now have a 50% chance of leak/s from there.  Then assemble the 
push rods and heads torqued back on before this sealant hardens.  While you 
have the cylinders off postion the rings for best compression and less oil 
loss by staggering them properly.  Also check for any stuck rings and 
carefully loosen them.  Do not mix up the cylinders to where they came from 
and go back on!    Eric&Barb
