Here's another thing to consider:  after all the fuel line and fuel pump
cleaning you did, it may be necessary to prime the pump.  I recently
rebuilt the original pump for my 67 DC (single screw on top) and also
replaced the piece of metal fuel line that goes into it.  Bus wouldn't
fire up after that, no gas coming out of the pump.  I took off the top
of the pump, filled it with gas, replaced top and recranked.  I did this
twice, and then it started back up and has been running fine since.
