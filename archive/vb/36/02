Subject: 40 HP in, but won't start

OK, so I got the 40 HP installed in the '64 today.  Now it craanks and cranks but won't fire.  After foing Muir's diagnostics I have conclude that: Coil is good, the wire sparks when the engine is turned.  Fuel pump good, gas is coming in.  I BELIEVE that I may not be getting a spark at the spark plugs though.  So please give a list of possible problems that would cause no spark at the plugs.  BTW, has new coil, spark plug wires, plugs.



Peace, John Baker
