How are your engine compartment seals?  ONe cause of major dust intrusion
like this is big air leaks around the engine bay.  I found this out when I
took my just-cleaned '71 on a long dirt road trip.  It was evident from
the dirt pattern that most of the dirt came in via the hole in my battery
tray.
