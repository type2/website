Subject: Re: [VB] Fuel Pump won't pump fuel.

did you properly tension the pump lever before install? i recently found
(bill bowman and neato!) that you need to do this, at least on 36, not sure
about 40 and 1500+

original likely quit due to diaphragm tearing. oxygenated fuel basically
dissolves old gasket material eventually.
