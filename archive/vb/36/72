Subject: Another Engine Question


I have the heads off my engine if you recall my earlier post to correct a 
pushrod tube leak problem.  Now, my son has turned the engine and loosened 
two of the Piston sleeves... is this a problem?  Do I need to pull the 
sleeves and reseat or will it be fine (as in correct) to put the heads back 
on and retorque when I get to that point?

Thanks.
