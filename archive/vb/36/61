Hi John:

Charge up the battery and then get the multimeter out on DC setting. Just
turn lights on, put multimeter leads on the correct battery poles. If the
voltage starts dropping and a 0 volts flat line situation can be extapolated
in about 2-3 minutes it's the battery. Alternator problems - once the
battery is charged and the vehicle can be started, attach the multimeter
leads which should read at a constant voltage above 12 somewhere which is
the alternator doing it's things. Don't know the VW specs but my Volvo is
14.6.... ask me how I know!! Mine was a dead battery.

Any truth to the recent rumour on CBC Newsworld linking your move to Ontario
to Premier Mike Harris rapid retirement announcement?????.... Care to
comment   ... :<)

Hope this helps.

Scott

So I went to start my but this morning and it just sort of clicked.  I was
able to jump start it later so I figure the battery is not charged.  I was
noticing a bit of static coming from the amp so I'm wondering if I may not
have a short somewhere between the fuse box, 8-track, and amp. My battery is
a Walmart battery - cheap like borsht and 2 years old so maybe it's just
cooked.  Or, maybe my battery is not getting charged.

Any ideas appreciated
