They also appear very much like a (Land) Rover 'beehive' front turn
signal. Here is a diagram:

They actually look like Porsche A model front turn signals or Hillman
husky!! could be valuable. If you don't have rectangle holes above your
tailights your bus didn't have back-up lights

I thought all '67s had rectangular BU lights above the tail lights.  The
ones in the pic are "custom".

Do you have the normal ones for a '67?  Any one know if VW was
consistent on this?

Remember, I am new to this stuff:
I have been watching close at backup light configurations, and I have
not seen this on anyone's yet. Is this a special setup, or am I just not
finding anything similar. I have this one in good condition, the other
is busted. I have replacement brake lights, but the white backup light,
is it unusual or just not used anymore?
