MOST of the dust came in thru the vents... some came up a split in the RF
engine seal, but not much. The lab destroyed almost all of the photos I
took of the sand; it was so impressive, I snapped like 10 shots of deep red
soil packed all over the innards of a green bus.   Pretty :)

I now see why those Aussie VW made that cool bypass arrangement to take air
from up by the cab!!
