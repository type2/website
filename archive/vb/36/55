Three engineers are driving down the road in a VW Bus. Suddenly, the bus
just stops without warning. Without even getting out, the three begin
debating the probable cause and solution for their dilemma. The first, an
electrical engineer, says that he thinks the problem is in the ignition
system. The second, a chemical engineer, says that he thinks the problem is
in the fuel system. The third, a Microsoft software engineer says "I think
we should close all the windows, get out, get back in and see if it runs".
