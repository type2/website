Ouch! I am hoping I have the right arm... But, I don't see a clutch pedal
return srping any where. Similar to the brake setup? My pedal falls to the
floor if the clutch cable is disconnected, and stays there if I press it
down while connected. I will check the relationship between the clutch cable
and tube, I think that is good, since the cable moves easily and I didn't
see rubbing.
Perhaps i am blaming the wrong end of the bus on this one.
I will get a 1.5 tap to fix the bolt holes, going deeper sounds like a safe
bet also.
Thanks to all with the advice on redux box attachment and cluthc cable
issues. I am hoping to overcome these this weekend, a couple more weeks
and.....
Vrooom...
Al

Hi AL,
You do need both the spring on the clutch pedal up front and on the clutch
cable arm on the tranny!

<<Also, the lever on the trans is curved inward toward the trans, and the
other lever I have is straight, which one is correct for a 66 bus?  >>

That would be a curved arm for your year, BUT you need the proper arm to
match the left side plate on your tranny that the rear of the boden tube
goes
throgh!  If the rear end of the boden tube does not aim directly through the
clutch cable arm on the tranny your clutch cable will rub against one side
of
the inside of the tip of the boden tube and you will need to replace the
worn/broken cable due to this about every 6-10,000 miles!  There were two
styles of curved armed clutch cable arms with the same length and curve
which
can be used with thier pre-1968 style side plate..  The post-1967 arms came
in an early short arm and later longer/taller arm and both of these requred
two differant post-1967 side plates to achieve proper boden tube/clutch
cable
to arm alignment for each.
