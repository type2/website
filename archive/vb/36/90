Never put the extinguisher right next to the place that is likely to catch
on fire.  Put it far enough away so that you can retrive it and think
about what you will do with it.

Reminds me about the local fire department that took delivery of a nice
new shiny pumper and made the mistake of parking it right next to the
burning building at the first fire they responded to.  yep, the pumper
went up too!
