Does the "local manufacture" only cover tools that are supposed to fabbed =
locally via a pattern (as the name would imply), or does it cover all =
those crazy items that pieslinger (sp?), matra, gedore etc. made specifical=
ly for vw over the years?

Thanks

Odd. The Obsolete AirCooled Documentation Project IS on VB, but the Local
Manu is only reported as "waiting to be scanned."

Anyways, on Thom's site click on the "NEW! PARTS MANUALS" link and get the
other docs in the program  :)
