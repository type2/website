Get an old spark plug wire. Cut or twist the spark plug end of it off.
Plug the other end into dizzy in place of a regular plug wire. Tranny
in neutral, parking brake on. Have your buddy crank the starter while
you hold the end of that wire about 1/4" from a good ground. I don't
know if it helps, but I like to wear gloves and not touch the bus
while doing this. Do you have spark or don't you? A bright blue-white
one is right. An orange-yellow spark is a weak spark. Try it, it's
fun.
Good luck,
Joel and the '64 Sundial
