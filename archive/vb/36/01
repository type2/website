I have that book, and did see the SO-1 brochure. I would ask Rich in Fres=
no, but he seems to be a bit unhappy that his isn't the only one around, =
and was less than eager to talk about it at Pomona. There is another one =
in the PNW, but it has a slider instead of cargo doors.

If you have the book "VW Bus, The First 50 Years" by Keith Seume there
are some good pictures on pages 23-25.  One of them is the front of a
Westy SO-1 brochure, so you might ask around among the literature
collectors.

Good luck!
