Subject: Re: [VB] Alternator Rebuild/Replacement

No way I would pull the engine to remove the alternator once I learned the
easy way to do it.  This isn't in any of my books, but it is far easier
than removing the engine and lifting the fan shroud.

You can look up my previous posts in the archives, but basically what you
do is disconnect battery and wires, remove carb, hold pulley still and
remove big nut on fan, remove belt, undo alt strap, unbolt alt tin, pull
alternator out.  Make sure you keep track of all the shims and washers on
the fan hub!

Reinstall in reverse order after setting fan gap with the fan out of the
bus.  Torque the fan nut by holding the big nut with a breaker bar and
torqueing the pulley nut.  They both have the same value.
