Subject: Steering Wheels at OCTO.

Hi,

Not only will I bring the steering wheel puller but I will also bring
along a stock of deluxe steering wheels. Also a couple of black ones.
The paint problem is solved and the wheels look great!.

Price:  $245 exchange,  $295 outright. Prices slightly higher, but I
am picking up the sales tax and there is no shipping charge.

Chris, see you at OCTO,
The Steering Man
