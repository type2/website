Hi Thomas,
Get your bus under cover for two or three days.  Use an air compressor to 
blow out the accumilated water out of the bottom of all the non-popout 
windows, while you carefully pry up the rubber.  Do this blow out twice a day 
till you get nearly no water blown or completely dry under the seals.  Then 
apply roofing tar under each seal around the complete perimeter of each.
