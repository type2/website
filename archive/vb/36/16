Hi Rex,
For the 3.875 freeway flier with .82 fourth gear in a swing axle tranny you 
need a 1968 only swing axle type 1 differential that has the later 8 bolt 
pattern to bolt in the ring instead of the earlier 6 bolt pattern.  Then you 
need a 3.875 R&P from a 1973 and later type 1 tranny.  Change second and 
third gears to avoid having any huge gaps in the shift points from going from 
the top of one gear to the next gear.  Plus a tiny bit of sanding to reduce 
the diameter of later pinion splines to allow earlier gears to be installed.  
Best to supply the parts and/or core trannies and have a reputible tranny 
rebuilder do the work.  Unless you really want to learn and do at least one 
tranny once a week to keep up on the ability to do it again!  Eric&Barb
