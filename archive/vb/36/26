Is that the book whose content basically states something like "You Need A Tool Now? Here's what
it looks like and the dimensions... make it your self."

Can you PLEASE post that book on VintageBus?!?!  Or if anybody knows what I'm talking about,
please post it.  I've never seen one, only have friends and old VW mechs that have.

thanks,
Travis
