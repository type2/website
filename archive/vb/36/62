Subject: door hinge needs fixing

My driver's door bottom door hinge was cut out of the door by a PO.  I found
it behind the speedo.  The backing plate is still there, and I tracked down
the bolts, and they're all fine.  The hinge still has the rivets and
original metal attached.  Also, the door appears to be in good shape in the
area it was cut out.  I have no experience in welding, but am assuming a
local metal shop should be able to re-attach the hinge to the door.  Any
thoughts on feasability/approx price? I am actually enjoying driving it
around the yard with no driver's door though :)
