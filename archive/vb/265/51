Hi Hapybus,
If we knew your location in the universe someone on the list in your area 
could supply shop info.  Till then try your yellow pages for fasteners!

Shaft diameter and thread count.  For SAE bolt you count threads per inch.  
For metric count how many threads in 10mm and divide the result by 10.
