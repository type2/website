Yes, there is a definite "hump" in the '61/'62 bus front bench seats. 
Only the back rest has the hump...not the bottom.  Two year only thing. 
The hump "separates" the driving position from the passenger spot. 
These two models also have the 3 position back/bottom seat brackets.  I
call them the "Billy Bardy" brackets, cuz only he was short enough to
need anything closer than the farthest back position. 

Lots of other 61/62 things I'm sure.  Odd.
