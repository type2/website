Subject: New tire find

In our ongoing quest to find the perfect tire for our
busses, I thought I'd share my find.  Our 66 westy was
in dire need of new rubber as the 195 sreies passenger
tires were in sad shape.  The usual phone calls turned
up similar recommendations AND if they had a tire that
would work, they had no adapter for balancing.  
    I phoned one last shop here in the Seattle area
and the fella seemed to understand what I was looking
for AND he had the ability to balance my rims.  He had
3 different light truck/commercial tires in the 185R14
size.  Looking for a M+S rated commercial tire, I
settled on a tire called Mastercraft Courser RD in
size 185R14C. This tire is apparantly made in the USA
by Cooper tire.  They have a fairly aggressive tread
pattern, are an 8 ply M+S rated tire with load range
D, to 1875lbs (-at-) 65psi.  The stance and wind stability
of the bus is much improved.  If you need any more
info or would like to know the name of the Seattle
area tire shop, let me know.
