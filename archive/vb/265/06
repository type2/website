Hump in the middle? This is a bench seat right?? No natural hump that I am
aware of-anyone else aware of a hump?? Is the hump from bunched up
padding/worn padding??

I have done the WW cover on new repro horsehair pads & they are very
nice-$260 for 1/3-2/3 bench seat-also done the TMI "economy" 1/3-2/3 over
foam pads-forget price-okay, but seemed overstuffed compared to the
horsehair pads.

Lenny Copp's upholstery is very nice(read very expensive) & probably not
worth it unless you are doing a trailer queen/have $$$ to burn

Doug Denlinger's upholstery is very correctomundo also.

Don't know anything about Sewfine, but they are out there.

If you can sew well & have the 60 DC seat as a pattern you could
make/install them, but you could also have an upholstery shop in your area
match the grey vinyl/white piping fairly easily & for probably no more than
the "kits".

IMHO,

Tom Buese-nothing better than a nicely upholstered seat to drive on
