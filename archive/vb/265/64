I find this thread interesting, as my bus has been running reliably, as in
ten to fifteen hours of maintenance a year, including oil changes, for
decades. Every five years or so, I replace the heads. Every decade, the
engine gets rebuilt from the ground up. I drove this bus from Sandy Eggo
to NY, to FL, and back to San Francisco last year. This year I drove it
from LA to NY and back, up thru OKC and ALB.

I have had two stopped-on-the-road experiences in the last 30.5 years. The
last one just happened last month when the Carberator failed - ten minutes
to replace it with my spare, and I'm on the road. I'll look at the old one
someday.

If my bus can be reliable for me as a daily driver, I think anyone's bus
can be too.

I find all these horror stories very puzzling. I chose to run this bus 30
years ago, because John Muir said I could keep it alive forever by merely
taking care of it. I am, and he was right.
