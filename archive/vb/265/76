Cal,

I think you are missing something in your own story...you have had your bus
for over thirty years, so you know everything that has gone into and out of
your bus, and you maintained it all yourself...most of us(like myself) got
our buses late in their lives(mine was over thirty when I got it) so there
are tons of mysteries in there...
