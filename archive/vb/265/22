  None of my 1960 year buses have hump (front) seats. I believe it started
with the low hindge cargo doors abd stopped with the 1/3 2/3 seat. My 62
panel had a hump seat.

 later bench seat buses (60, 61) have humps.  ones with three adjustment 
positions, before they went to 1/3 2/3  I think the frame, padding and cover
are 
different, but never recovered the one in my 61.

  Hump in the middle? This is a bench seat right?? No natural hump that I am
  aware of-anyone else aware of a hump?? Is the hump from bunched up
  padding/worn padding??
