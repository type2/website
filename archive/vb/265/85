Yes, I realize that - I am responding to an implied sense of unreliability
in these old buses. At least, it seemed that way late last night! ;-)

When you buy an old bus, it's your responsibility to go thru it with a
fine toothed comb, correct all the problems, and then, drive off into the
sunset. I'm not saying that Diane hasn't tried to do this. If I was living
down there in FL where she is, I'd have gone over there on some weekend
and check out her problem when she first called the list. Not to make
other FL's feel guilty, just that I would have gone over there. There are
simply too many idiot-fake mechanics claiming that they work on VWs to
ignore them.

As an old friend in Oklahoma once told me back in the 80s, 'you can pay
someone to work on your car, but you can't pay anyone to fix it'.

I suspect that Diane bought the bus, not realizing that it needs primary
attention and quality service, which is rare these days. Once an old bus
has been brought up to spec, it should last forever with minimal
maintenance. If they didn't I wouldn't own one.
