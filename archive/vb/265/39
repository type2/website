Wow,
Let's see.  We have the 23 win pinata and the watermelon bus.
Sounds like the party is ready to go.

Wait!!!!

I'll be back in a minute, have to go finish the Panel Smoker and the Double 
Cab Flat Bed Grill ;-)

Nice work, would hate to see it put to use, but looking at the size of it, 
that thing is HUGE and would hold enough candy to make a school of kids happy.
