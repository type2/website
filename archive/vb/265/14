Today I got to work on my Wide White Wall Tire Project for the '61 Double Cab.

What I decided to do was to try a process that an old guy had told me 
about. He said it was an old "budget" hot rodder trick called buffing 
the sidewalls. When a lot of tires are made, they put a whole strip 
of white along the sidwall of the tire, then just let whatever part 
they want to show by cutting the black that goes on top of it. 
Whether that's a small white wall strip or white letters or whatever. 
So when you buy a Wide White Wall tire they're basically charging you 
all that extra money for something that's already in the tire.

Apparantly some tire shops used to do this process where they remove 
some of the black off the white to widen the white wall. I imagine 
they've got some jig or something to make it a precise process. I 
don't have that luxery as I wasn't even sure if it'd work. So I used 
my brother's dremal and got after it.

It took much longer than I thought it would, but I have to say I'm 
happy with the result. Up close, you can see some issues, but even 3 
feet away it looks great. It takes about an hour or so to do one tire 
(for me) and I think that there is probably a better method, but this 
will be the way I do this set. I've got almost 2 done so far and the 
second one is looking much better than the first one already.

I don't reccomend anyone do this, and take no responsibility for 
anyone who does. With that out of the way, I have to say I'm quite 
content with the job and here's a picture of the first one:

Budget wide white wall tires.

Last thing. I told my wife I needed help drawing flames and gave her 
a picture as reference. She drew some flames on some butcher paper in 
about 2 or 3 minutes and asked if they looked good. I said "I don't 
know, let's hold it up to the truck". They looked perfect! I hadn't 
planned on using a template and tracing around it, but these were 
exactly what I wanted and this way I can get them the same on both 
sides. I may have to do that little project before the final 
unveiling of the truck!
