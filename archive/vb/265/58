Sounds like your "mechanic" is a freakin' nightmare; should have got out of
there a long time ago. At this point I would take my engine somewhere else
and send them the bill. If he treats you like that in his own shop I would
be a little worried about how well he would repair your motor. I hope you
have a better business bureau in FL.
