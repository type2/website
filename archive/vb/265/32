Hi Kevin,
Was the gasket off at the top??  The 1970s valve covers are much better 
because they have a dimple in the top of them just under the center/top of the 
gasket there.

Make sure to also center punch around all the brass tube fuel line fittings 
in the fuel pump and carb to help prevent this!!  Good to hear it did not catch 
fire!!!!

Yes!!  That is what a connecting rod will do when it breaks loose of the 
piston.

With the proper bus muffler, carb jetted for your muffler and air cleaner, it 
should work after you fix any "Mickey Mouse" stuff on it.

By the time you got the oil pressure light it was too late.  Which is why we 
will only run our VWs with oil pressure and temp gauges.  These will show one 
problems well before the idiot light does.  We have saved several engines by 
having these!  If you had just gotten a tow after the oil light you would have 
saved the engine case, and the connecting rods and crank from major damage, 
but still needed a rebuild.  Even if you had pulled over and gotten a tow just 
after hearing the rattle you would have saved those parts.  At least with your 
oil filter your oil cooler is clean of the metal shavings that suddenly came 
loose in there.
