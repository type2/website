Some auto parts stores have a big paper catalog from somebody like
Timken that has this kind of info.  Mostly the catalog is for cross-
referencing the numbers of the various bearing manufacturers (Timken,
SKF, FAG, etc) but it may have car manufacturer part numbers in it.
As I understand it, those 5-digit numbers are somewhat standard in
the bearing industry.  The paper bearing catalog tends to be more
complete than the cross-reference they sometimes have on their
computers, so you might try them when they're not too busy and don't
mind thumbing through the book for a while.  As far as I know, these
aren't online much, but you might try the sites of the manufacturers
listed above.
