78 stroke, 90.5 bore. With 57cc's in the head, and a 10cc dish in the
piston, you can go with .065" deck, which is plenty of squish for a street
motor gives you 7.5:1 CR.

I don't see a need to go over 5Krpm in a bus myself. Plenty of low end
torque is what will make a bus a happy driver around town, and if he's
running a .82 4th, with a 3.88 r&p, I don't see him needing to go over 5k
myself.
