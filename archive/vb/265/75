Subject: gland nut question/airs help

Quick update:

It turns out when Dan put his engine together, he didn't use a washer with
the new gland nut, his flywheel must have slipped - probably due to not
being tightened properly, and the dowels ovaled out the holes in the
flywheel and crank shaft. We brought it down to the local vw guy, and he is
going to try to weld up the holes and re-drill (I think that is what he is
going to do)...then a new gland nut/washer and throwout bearing...
Then hopefully put it all back together...I know the "correct" way is to
pull the engine apart, new crankshaft, and new flywheel or something like
that...but budget, time and space are limited...he needs to get down to new
Orleans...about 3-4000 more miles, then he will have time to take the engine
apart if necessary...
