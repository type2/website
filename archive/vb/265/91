Subject: RE: [VB] Compression Ratio

  Getting 10 cc out of a piston really thins the tops out (Mahle pistons).
You have to make sure that timing, fuel mixtures etc. are correct or a major
melt down can occure. VW dished pistons have 5 cc cut into them. We have
tried to take them to 10 and even 15 cc (cutting used set to check) and felt
that the tops of the pistons were getting to thin. 
  Check the archieves and you can see dyno specs on both 1800 cc and 1904 cc
engines and one of these days I will post the dyno specs on a 1914. 
  It's amazzing how the HP and torque specs are very close on all three
engines built with the same heads, cam, compression ratio and carbs. Even
though we did find that CB Perforamances 34 pict 3 duel carbs did make more
HP and torque then a set of Kadrons on  the engine!
  On the next engine dyno run (another 1800) I am going to also try a set of
Low Budget racing tweeked Kadrons against some prototype 36 pict 3's
(testing these)

all engines were 7.1 to 1 compression

ps. All 3 engines start to fall off the HP at 5500 rpm and the torque at
4500 rpm's

78 stroke, 90.5 bore. With 57cc's in the head, and a 10cc dish in the
piston, you can go with .065" deck, which is plenty of squish for a street
motor gives you 7.5:1 CR.

I don't see a need to go over 5Krpm in a bus myself. Plenty of low end
torque is what will make a bus a happy driver around town, and if he's
running a .82 4th, with a 3.88 r&p, I don't see him needing to go over 5k
myself.
