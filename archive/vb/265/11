Hmm...I think it's more likely that shops would like to sell the $8
electronic relay instead of the $2 thermal one, but whatever.  :)

A 559 should have _four_ prongs, X (feed), P (pilot), L (lamps), and
E (ground).  Just like the original VW flasher.

Probably, but the pilot light may glow even when the turn signals are
off.  See http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/063393.html for why.
This is only a problem on about '63-'65 Buses where the turn signals
work all the time, instead of with the key.
