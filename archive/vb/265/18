Yes, of course it is.  I specifically said that I did NOT receive a bus 
rear wheel bearing: "Well, it turned out not to be that at all."

Been there, done that.  Yes, I know what a bus rear wheel bearing is, 
and this ain't it.

If you would read my whole post you would see the description of the 
bearing I actually received:  "It looks to me like an early bus or bug 
inner front wheel bearing.  It's old enough to have balls instead of 
rollers.  It does have some identifying markings: The initials 'FKC' 
and the number '17304'."

Here is my question (again):  Is there a database somewhere which 
identifies bearing applications by the numbers marked on the bearings, 
maybe with a cross reference to VW part numbers?

Or does someone have this same bearing and happen to know what VW part 
number it corresponds to?  Ron, do you stock the old ball style 
bearings for the front of buses?  If so, do you have one from FKC?

Thanks,
