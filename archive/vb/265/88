Stan,

I think basically you are pretty on target re the real junkers, but I've
seen and heard of total basket cases being fully restored. The frame rot
on my own bus was so bad when I started the resto in 94, that it was
almost a no-do. But these badly treated buses continue to be bought and
sold. The problem is that the uneducated new buyer doesn't have a clue
what needs to be done to bring one of the bad ones up to spec. That's the
problem. Any old bus can be rebuilt with enough time and energy.
Diane's problem was not knowing anything about these buses, or about the
actual condition of her bus when bought. Also, having rip-off
pseudo-mechanics taking her for all she could pay, and not even working on
the bus, hasn't helped either.
