Yikes! you are approaching the area where legends are made.  You might have 
taken one of the all time loads for DCs with that one.  Not a nice feeling 
when there is little tire contact in the front.

checked out the progress on the Garage and it looks like it's moving right 
along.

Are you going to insulate the walls/ceiling?

What are you doing for electrical out there, a subpanel from the main house?

Great idea on the gate.  Now all you have to do is hook a chain to is and 
connect up a gear reduction motor and you're talking luxury.

Take it easy with the DC :-)
