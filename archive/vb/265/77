Subject: Compression Ratio

What would be best compression ratio for this engine:
78mm crank x 90.5 PC; oval ports; 40mm in - 37.5 mm ex; 1 5/8 exhaust
with heater boxes removed; doghouse cooling w/type 4 oil cooler. This
is my shot at a HIPO engine in a slittie still running RB with 3.88
RP/ 0.82 4th. Any advice or opinions on the compression ratio that I should run with thiscombination?
