How arrogant can one be? 
He should not take it personally as I think most of us are smart enough to
realize the true value of this vehicle, granted it may be a "collectors
piece" but, there is no way on this green earth that this guy is going to
make mint off it. Not in that condition...we ought to flood his inbox with
"1000's" lowball offers of $500 and $600 dollars....

Makes me sick,
Scott
