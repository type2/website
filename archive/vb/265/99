Well, there's always second gear :)
I don't seem to find heads with anything near 57cc's.
Average chambers in my last 150 og heads were 47.
If I'm gonna spend money on a stroker, I will be using
premium gas and look for highway performance.
Somebody's gonna do the math and tell you that 149 mph
is way too fast to be doing 5K rpm anyway :)
