Everyone pretend that I'm not as ignerent as I sound! I've seen 62 DC's w/o
this hump as well as 60 & 63 DC's so ASSuming that they don't exist is well
ignerent!

I stand corrected, & am waiting breathlessly for a pic of one of these rare
humpback seats to be posted.

Is it related to the rare humpback chub on the endangered species list here
in Utah?
