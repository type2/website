Subject: RE: The Empi Truck

I love when stuff like this gets started. Sure the truck is rough, but
it is a very important part of VW hitstory. How cool would it be to have
an original Inch Pincher sitting on the back of this rig again? I would
not pay the dollars for that, but that does not mean that no one should
or that they are stupid for doing so. If it really is THE Empi truck
then there is no way of putting a fair value on that. A fair value is
what ever a buyer and seller agree on especially for something so
collectible. If it is super nice or super rare or very important to the
history of the make are all things that ad value. 2 out of 3 ain't bad.
I don't know this guy and don't have any idea what he expects to get for
the truck but I didn't read anything in his ad that makes me feel like
he was being really arrogant. I do tend to be put off by people not
putting at least a good solid starting figure for something, so you have
an idea what they would consider an insulting offer. I was really stoked
to see this truck resurface as a friend and I were just leafing through
one of the mags and saying how cool it would be to own one of those
original Empi trucks. I don't have deep enough pockets to play in this
particular game, but that doesn't make think any less of those who do. I
say go for it and save a really cool piece of air cooled history.

Just some of my not always popular thoughts,
