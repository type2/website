Sometimes I wonder how Everett does it myself, as there are plenty worse kind's of folks on there beside just "gold-diggers". If you visit certain parts of the message boards you'll know of who(m) I speak. It's still my favorite site regardless. 
 
I would like to see the truck redone to it's former glory, it was pretty cool.
