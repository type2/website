Sounds like your "mechanic" is a freakin' nightmare; should have got out of there a long time ago. At this point I would take my engine somewhere else and send them the bill. If he treats you like that in his own shop I would be a little worried about how well he would repair your motor. I hope you have a better business bureau in FL.
 
 Too bad you didn't live closer I could have done your center pin in about an hour!
