i think someone should email him and see if he's interested in parting it 
out. it has a few good pieces left. he'd probably make more money that 
way, then again, there's always some "aficionado" that has the money to 
waste on some timeless project like this, but i wouldn't. 
there are many of his type out there and i have to say IMHO, more often 
than not, you'll find them on thesamba...simple abuse of a perfect system 
and far too many gold diggers out there, who says we've learned anything 
from the gold rush days. on the other hand, there wouldn't be any 
"golddiggers" if there weren't the demand for [fools] gold.
