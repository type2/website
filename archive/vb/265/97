It'll sell. You can count on it. And he'll get a good sum of cash for 
it too. Nothing wrong with it. Wish I was the one who found it for 
nothing. I wouldn't sell it though. I'd keep it with all my other 
basket case busses.

"gonna fix up that truck one of these days"

At least the deep pockets who do by it will actually fix it and put 
it back on the road. Look for it to be in the mags 3-4 years from now.
