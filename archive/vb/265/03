Subject: reupholstering seats

Hey greg,

Didn't you post a while ago about reupholstering your seats, and trying to
figure out the two buttons on the top of the seat? I just got my new seat
upholstery and pads. I have reupholstered my bus seats, not too hard, and
thought I could tackle these seats as well-but they look a little more
complicated...

Any suggestions?

-Kevin
