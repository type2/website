What Craig said.

This is a true collector's item.  Its current value will be determined
completely by what the market will bear. (Which will depend entirely on its
provenance.) There are those of us who have bitched loud and long about some
nicely restored deluxe bus being bought for more dollars than we'll ever
have in one pile and shipped west. There are *lots* of deluxe buses. There's
one of these. It's worth whatever someone is willing to pay for it.

Think about it for a few minutes...  How much to restore? $10k? Value
restored? Plain ole fire trucks bring $25-30k.  NOW, what's a documented
EMPI racecar transporter worth?

A good comparison might be one of the Jaguar team transporters from the
fifties.  Last one I heard of changing hands went for nearly a mil.
