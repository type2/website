BOTH !!! DEAD is DEAD ! People, engines, whatever...
Only a lunatic would let a customer drive home with faulty steering.
It's time to introduce yourself again (your location please), and the name
of your local repair facility.

Yup. New and NEW are two different thangs !
However, Junque is still junk.
Carpe Diem. Caveat Emptor.
Carp is not Caviar !

You can't debate. Tell him you have some friends with old vw's
and they ALL NEED WORK ! ENGINES AND EVERYTHING !!!

It's called entropy :)

Clutch needs an adjustment.

Uh-oh.

Grab that check right back out of his hands !
I bet you will get a better explanation, and real fast !

Maybe you can swap for your old engine !

Like I said, tell him you lost the receipt amd want to start a logbook,
so get him to write it all down so you can understand.
And you will have a real receipt.
Not like you did when you bought it !

Too easy. Get the name of the # 3 man. He EARNS his money.

>Could they have installed it with the motor mount already broken ??

Yup.

>there is a motor mount right ??

Nope. It's a 67. I win ! Sorry, Stan:) !

> is there more than one /?

Yup. Two.They are called transaxle mounting blocks.
They do not attach to the engine. Look at your photos.
They go between the transaxle and the mounting support.

Good Luck ! Get Those Photos ! Find the A.I.R.S. list.
at www.type2.com You need local help fast.
