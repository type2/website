I'm shocked they even knew what it was, let alone looked at it
mechanically!  Seeing that most dealerships balk at even a 10 year old
VW.  "Wow, a '95 huh?  That's almost too old, we might not have the
parts for it" was the reaction I got in a dealership parts department
recently.  I was looking for parts for my '95 water pumper.

I stopped in with the '62 DC to check on the above mentioned parts and
not one person even mentioned it.  Might as well have been a '87 Yugo
for all they knew.
