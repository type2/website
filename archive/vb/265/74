Subject: Re: The Empi Truck

..there are plenty worse kind's of folks on there..

very true, and i too like to browse the site regardless, it just seems 
like part of the culture that shouldn't be. i guess it's like a small 
snapshot of america, there's all kinds and some are more appropriate than 
others, but they all co-exist somehow.

..I would like to see the truck redone to it's former glory, it was pretty 
cool...

i agree here too, i guess my antagonistic side was showing through, i 
would just like to see all those hundreds of emails flood his inbox....
