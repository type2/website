Hello!

Probably someone with more money than brains!! Or one of those Empi 
"collectors" that are out there just stockpiling the stuff. He seems to think it's 
worth a fortune, maybe it is, but I cant imagine a rational person paying what he 
seems to want for that rotten thing which looks like it was dredged out of 
Lake Erie, but not before it was painted 17 times with Dutch Boy... Oh well, I 
forgot what I was saying!
