Subject: New Splitty Hitch

I know some of you have expressed an interest in a hitch for pre '68 busses.
I'll throw out a new design for you're inspection.  I've spent most of the
summer perfecting a hitch that has these features:

Does not have to be removed to change oil.
Adjusting valves is not a problem
Should work with header exhaust system (I haven't tried yet)
Replaces flimsy bumper brackets.
Is "hidden" behind bumper.
Gives the rear of the bus an extra measure of crash protection.
Strengths the rear frame.
Has slot for corner gravel guards.
Uses a 2" reciever style mount.
Bike racks, or cooler mounts can be used in the reciever.
Requires no holes to be drilled, totally bolt on.

And the feature I am most proud of, a special bracing system that takes all
the tongue and pulling forces off the frame and puts them onto the torsion.
This feature will put a "pre load" on the rear frame taking all weight off
the frame.  This is such a different idea that I am putting a patent pending
on this feature.

I will have a couple of these hitches at RMMW, which I will be leaving for
as soon as I send this.  If you would like to see one of these, look for the
yellow westy pulling the white Scamp.  I think both of these are spoken for,
but I may be making more in the future.

I'm sorry I don't have any pictures yet, you'll need to see the hitches in
person for now.
