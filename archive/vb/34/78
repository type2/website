Subject: round about way to Pomona

   I'm on my way to Pomona, the long way. First I will drive 200 miles to
Phoenix, then I transfer all my parts to the Westfailure then on to Pomona,
another 450 miles, then repeat the same for the trip home Sunday night. See
you at Pomona (those that go), I will be if the Westfailure row 34 space 27.
Right there with Rex the T-shirt and sticker guy.

ronnie   see ya
