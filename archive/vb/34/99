Subject: '67 Backup lights - Troubleshooting

I'm trying to figure out whether my switch or grounds are bad on my '67.

I have both back-up lights with separate grounds to the body. If I put the
van in reverse and then stop; shut off the motor; and turn the key on to
provide electric power only; the backup lights should still theoritically be
on. Is this correct? If it is then I can use the multimeter to figure out
what's going on.....

Thanks for any replies in this matter....

Scott
