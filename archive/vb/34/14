Hi Al,
Correct!
 
<<For the cleaning idea, the tube most resembles a shotgun barrel. Mine is 
dry (no grease), and has surface rust (from condition of rod), so my approach 
is
 to use a shotgun clenaing brass brush with a solvent even, and a drill to 
wire brush it clean. Any one use paint on rod or inside tube? I thought a
 treatment/paint of some sort could be applied with a cotton swab also for 
shotgun cleaning.  Of course, liberal greasing before reassembly.  >>

Clean it as best you can with the shotgun cleaning wire brush!  You might 
have better luck with using Navel Jelly from your local hardware store with a 
over night or two application.  Then clean and just grease the interior of 
the tube.  Check with Wolfsburg West about the front and rear rubber boots to 
keep out the water/mud and sand/dirt.
