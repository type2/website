This has been in my head for a while.  It needs to come out.
Hey, it's still Friday in California...

"Six Volt Man" by Matt Roberds
Tune: "Backdoor Man" by the Doors

Yeah, I'm a six volt man

Chorus:
I'm a six volt man
The boys don't know
But the old men understand

Sometimes at night the lights get dim and flick
I gotta clean the lugs on my 6006, yeah yeah

Chorus

Your big subwoofers pump bass low and mean
I change more brushes than any man ever seen, yeah, yeah

Chorus
