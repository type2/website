Hi Rocky,
Sounds like a loose shift linkage bolt/s.  Check all four for tightness and 
make sure to safety wire them so the wire tightens them and does not loosen 
them!  If that is not the problem you need to remove the engine and tranny to 
replace the rear shift linkage bushings, grease and replace the rubber boots 
that seal the tube ends.

Up to 1960 there was a wire bracket bolted to the side of the tranny to 
prevent this.  1961 and later there was a boden like tube for the cable.  We 
bought some of these tubes for later bug (111 721 551 is the listed bus 
manual part for this, and mentions needing to shorten it to 670mm, but in our 
experience it should be 760mm instead.) and had to shorten them about 1/4" 
after carefully slipping off one crimped on end and relacing it after the 
shortening.   Eric&Barb
