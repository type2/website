Jay,

Regarding battery switches and nifty electrical equipment to change 12v to 
110ac look at marine supply places.  Try boatus.com or westmarine.com and 
search their catalogs.  Also, there are more sophisticated places like 
Consumer Electronics (a marine electronic supply outlet) located in Wall or 
Alaire New Jersey.  They have a catalogue and may have a web site.  I will 
look at home tonight and see if I have any contact info for them.
