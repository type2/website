NO!  The numbers are not a matter of increasing specification, but of
completely different specification.  An oil can meet GL-5 and not meet
GL4!  Even a oil that meets both may not have the proper formula for your
VW transmission.

The chemical compostions are different and the GL-5 formula allows use of
levels of chemicals that can attack the metals in your synchros.  No
problem for the first year or two, but big problems thereafter!
