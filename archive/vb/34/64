Subject: Highroof Camper

List:

Does anyone know the owner/seller of the Dove Blue Highroof with the German camper conversion?  It was for sale about a year ago, it was on Everett's site for awhile in teh vehicles for sale area.  I think the seller was Nick.?  He brought it to Solvang, then drove it back to Florida if my memory serves me correctly.

If anyone has any contact info please pmail me.

TIA.

Robert
