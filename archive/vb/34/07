I've seen one, but immediately replaced it with a 2-piece tin.

I've never had a problem with these screws loosening any more than the
reat of the tin.  I just take a big screwdriver and tighten everything up
every 10K or so.

There are a few places where hex bolts should be used in place of cheese
head screws to facilitate removal.  These are the ends of the fan shroud,
to attach the little heat riser seals to the breastplate, and where the
fan shroud attaches to the Hoover bit.  In all these cases, the hex head
screws are easier to remove than cheese head screws becauase direct access
to these screws is blocked by other parts.
