Hi Don,
If you want ball joints you need a 68-69 front suspension and if you are 
going to all that trouble you should look into installing 1973-79 front disc 
brakes.  Doing this ball joint conversion will raise the front about 2" 
higher than stock though!

It would have to be a type 1 to fit unless huge body modifications were done 
in the rear torsion bars area and since it has a 113 part number which is 
type 1......  It could be from a bug or KG with it's higher fourth gear or 
have been rebuilt badly with much lower gearing than any stock type 1.   When 
we got our 1960 panel van it came with a bus tranny in it that would only do 
35MPH (-at-) 3,000 RPM in fourth gear instead of the stock 47MPH!
