Subject: Puyallup here I come!

Gonna take a break from school this weekend and drive the oval window over
to the Puyallup show.  I just picked up a '68 squareback and was gonna
drive that over but it's not done yet.  I'd really like to meet some of
the list members.  I'll be the one hangin' out by the Strato-silver oval
with the ridiculous price tag in the window chilling out with some of the
hepcats from Spokane.  Oh, yeah, and I'll have pics of my totalled '57
Standard if anyones interested.  See ya there.
