I have run 7.5BTDC with this combination.  I don't think that is is
possible to get the setup to the point where it doesn't hesitate.

If you want to run the 009, you're better off with the 30PICT-1 carb.  I
run this in a bug with no hesitation at all.  If you want to run a -3
carb, you really need a vacuum distributor.
