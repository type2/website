Yep, I got home with a lighter wallet, and the
singlecab that John Howard found.  It turns out that
it may be a 1957, because it was built before the end
of August, 1957, and it should have the earlier
taillights, I think (re the spec guide).  Anybody have
a better guess?  The id number is 272409.

Got the original title, and the engine is correct and
runs!  Gonna get a prestige New Mexico plate with the
original plate number, so it will only have had one
number ever!  Next up; making it stop.
