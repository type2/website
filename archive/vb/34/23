Subject: RE: [VB] Front Wheel Cylinders

  E and B, you are not correct on the wheel cylinders. The fronts on the 63
and earlier have a different bolt pattern then the later to 67 wheel
cylinders and will not bolt up with-out major modifications, but you are
correct on the bore sizes, they are the same from mid 55 to 1970.  
  I do have kits for these and I also have budget front wheel cylinders for
the 63 and earlier buses, these cost 25 dollars a piece, verses around 40
for ATE.

HiCraig,
Mar55 to AUG63!  The funny thing is that the bore size of the 1955-67 brake 
cylinders are the same size.  The 1964-67 ones just have a thicker base to 
align the thier center line to the center line of the 1964-67 wider brake 
shoes and drums.  One could make shims to make the earlier brake cylinders 
work in the later brake system.
