I really dont think that it was a matter of not
"punching the holes", I would rather think that
Volkswagen didn't see the need to make a new stamping
for the inside metal of the SS, when it would be
covered by a headliner anyways. And sunroof kombis,
who cares what they look like inside, they are for
work.
