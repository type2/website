Subject: Re: [VB] Where are all the middle seats?

there's one here from a '60 dd standard.  i saw one of these go for over
$2000 on ebay last year and this one is just as mint as that one was.  dont
know anyone looking for one in the northeast do ya?  i just dropped off a
full width from a 65 at the selinsgrove show.  i do have a sneeking
suspicion where there are a couple more in this junkyard that hasnt been
open in about 15 years, but the owner is old and crazy, so he rarely lets
anyone under 60 years old in there.  if you are in the area some night and
wanna try to get one, give me a call, but bring some dark clothes and a ski
mask.  a heavy jacket is good to have also because he likes to shoot rock
salt at us.
