Subject: Re: [T2] Dead Horse revived, wheres that hole??

it's ported to one of the vacuum ports on the outside of the carb. If they
are referring to the hole IN the throttle plate, you remove the carb and
it's on the butterfly (use a pop rivet to close, it's easy to drill out when
you get sick of the 009).
