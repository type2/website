Subject: Re: [VB] Sunroof Barndoor Kombi special?

Here's my two cents.
Four grand for that is way too much. Not too long ago
there was a decent barndoor on the samba for 7k that
was way more complete and restorable. I would love a
brandoor but they are pretty expensive. have you
priced a 23 window lately? How about a middle seat?
Ambulance fan?ect ect ect
