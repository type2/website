Subject: Sherwin Williams Paint/Primer

Hey,

I am about to go pick up some acrylic primer from Sherwin Williams, but
since this is not gonna be cheap, I would really appreciate any:  "Hey don't
use that stuff", and any reasons.  I haven't seen any PPG dealers in the
area, and this would be my first choice.  The price is somewhere around
$188.00 for a gallon of this stuff.  This price includes hardener/reducer.

Again, someone yell if this is gonna be a mistake.

Thank you.
