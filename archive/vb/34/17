George is right.  For more, go to 
http://www.type2.com/archive/search-vintagebus.html and punch in
"gl4" as the search term.  Read all the messages rated five buses
and as many of the four-bus ones as you care to.

As far as getting it direct, Swepco does have a Web page.  To place
an order, they want you to contact your field rep - if you tell
1.800.359.5823 or lube(-at-)swepcousa.com where you are, they will tell
you who your rep is.  No affiliation, etc.
