Subject: Sunroof Barndoor Kombi special?

Is the sunroof Barndoor Kombi that's for sale on TheSamba as special as the 
guy thinks? I over heard him talking about it at a show this past weekend. He 
seems to think it's gold.
Considering all it's missing is $4000 anything but outrageous? or are pre 55 
type 2's that much more valuable that post 55?

Thanks,
Brian
