If JP has a 58 # 272409 then I guess my SC is a 58 as well.
My engine plate Chassis # is 279702. It has the no hump engine lid. I thought 
it was a 57. It came from the Holbrook AZ area with next to no rust.

Thanks to all who attended B&B. you made it a real show.
ABC did start the B&B show. They made the trophies and gave us the nerve to 
do it.
Thank you ABC members.
