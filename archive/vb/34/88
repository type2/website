Subject: Re: [VB] Where are all the middle seats?

Well, it was Friday, and I was really only just wondering, while searching
for a matching sock.  I don't need one right now, but I am in the Northeast
(CT).  It's more like, why were they taken out in the first place, but I
guess the answer lies somewhere in the economics of supply and demand.  Too
bad.  Sad but true that the dollar has no morals, and that the $um of parts
and pieces from a bus that gets cut up and parted out is worth so much more
money than the bus as a whole.  Both of my busses probably would have gone
that route if they lived somewhere else.  That yard you speak of sounds very
familiar.  A similar one near me got repossessed and leveled while I was
away at college.  There used to be at least ten splitties lined up visible
from the road, and countless others and who knows what lurking in the
various barns and property in back.  There are now two lovely raised ranches
there, with splotches of grass that just won't grow :)
