Hi Rob,
If it is a tiny hole or more likely a seep it can hold pressure in the tank.  
Quite likely that the sump dip of the tank has held water so long in it that 
the tank has rusted though there.  This can be prevented if one cuts the 
outlet tube that goes in the tank off so as to allow water to settle in the 
carb where it is easier to remove/clean out.  Eric&Barb
