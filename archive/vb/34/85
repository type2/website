Subject: RE:restos/projects! And Sunroof standard & Kombi inner roofs

Thanks Jim, for the compliment, i think, grin.
On the sun roof Standards and Kombi's inner section, I just finished Kent's
56 Standard sunrooof, I also have a 56 sunroof kombi he dropped off when he
picked up the other one. The deal on the roof is this , the inner structure
has the skylight holes in it , but VW used a outter roof section that had
the sunroof hole but not the skylights section. If you look close with the
skylights out, the inner is spotwelded to the outter just like the rest of
the windows. It has nothing to do with not being punched out, the roof was
made with out the skylights in it as far as i can tell. I have pics some
where in a file of the 56 standard inner area showing and can snap some of
the kombi , just p-mail me ,,later
