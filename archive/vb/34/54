Subject: Impressed with recent restos/projects!

I have been *totally* impressed with three recent
projects recently. Hats off to David Mayes with the
totally kick butt double cab, John Jones with the high
class creatively thought out and executed DD Deluxe 7
door slammed and bad assed panel and the early Westy
completed by Robert Davis. If you have ever attempted
to go through, freshen up, refurb, customize dreaming
of surgically puss-perfection of your idea like Jones,
concur the irritatingly miniscule details of an all
wood interior like Davis or manically and overcome an
insanely anal to the extreme restoration/(over
restoration and we dont care-cuz we love it) like
"NOS" Mayes then you can appreciate the time, energy,
capital investment, sacrifices made by
family-relationships and sapping of spirit. I should
also include our buddy the MetWizard. Y'all are crazy!
=) These are the current heros of our craft! 

These projects make up for all of the bondoed rusted
over priced ordinary boring river bottom filler
fossilized pieces of garbage which are most prevalent
in today's VWs for sale scene. The buses that I'd buy
if I had money dripping outta my butt would be
Dustin's dove blue highroof and then find a completely
fine splitty dormie to park next to it.
