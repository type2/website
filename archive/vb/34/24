Hey Kyle,
Yeah, supplying Tequila and coffee the next morning to the locals was such
a pain.:)  I was thinking it was pretty bad of me that I had to drink
coffee that came from Arizona, but it sure was appreciated. Thank you.
Kyle and Dede are hospitable folks.  The Arizona crowd is greatly appreciated
at Busses and Balloons and the event sure wouldn't be the same without them.
As I understand it, there probably wouldn't be B&B without the ABC.
I thank JP, Alex of Foreign Aide and their crews for all the effort.
This year was a great event.
Hopefully Jon and Rachel are home or well on their way from Ronnie's and
JP has returned from Havasu with his newest project behind his nuclear
55 Chevy panel.

John K.
