It's gold.  I'd like to own it but $4000 is too much for me, IMHO, based
on all the welding and repair work and expen$ive missing parts that it lo=

like it needs.  Judging by his description and the photos, it looks MUCH
worse (to me) than the ad leads you to believe.  Of course, I haven't see=

it in person.

It's a Standard, not a Kombi.  If it was a Kombi...  ;)
