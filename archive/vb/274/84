Subject: Floor mat alternative?

    I currently have carpet as my og piece fell apart when I took it out.
What is everybody else doing?  I think I could cut one out of that black
rubber sheeting, but haven't tried it yet.

    Also,  I just finished making new door, kick and headliner panels for my
bus out of 1/8" luan and stained it to match the turqoise.  I cut out for 5"
speakers in the doors, and drilled holes to run the wire just above the bottom
hinge on the door and body.  I don't like how this looks when the door is open
and when closed it folds up and sticks out in the cab.  Is there a better way
to do this?

    The new panels almost look too nice and make the og sundial interior look
bad.  The wife wants to redo the entire interior to match my new panels.  Here
are some pics, I ran out of clips for the panels and they arent that great as
I took them with my phone.
