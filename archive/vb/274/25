Up to mid 64, they used the lock plates, which are,
and have been for a long time, an NLA part. And VW
makes it expressedly clear NOT to re-use the locktabs,
kinda like not to re-use the front spindle locktabs.
After that it was spring washers, I don't think split
lock washers. I have seen split lock washers used, but
they looked like they were purchased at a hardware
store, and not a VW or dealer installed item (too
thick, not correct i.d, etc). The updated service
installation was for spring washers.
According to Bentley, 63-67, sec H-2, page 3:
"From Chassis No. 1197853, the lock plate-Part No. 211
513 535 for the spring plate securing screws was
replaced by a spring washer-Part No. N12 232 1. The
washer can be used on all Transporters when carrying
out repairs. The lock plate will be discontinued as a
spare part."
Another thing to consider is the reality that the
currently produced (and for some time now) bolts that
are available for this application (12 X 1.5 X 25 
grade 10.9) have a 19mm head size, and not a 17mm like
earlier bolts. If you use a locktab on the current
bolts, because the diameter of the head of the bolt is
larger, there really isn't enough "meat" on the
locktab to do much to secure it on the side of the
head of the bolt. You are MUCH better off using a
spring washer with the current bolts, which you should
replace anyway, especially if the old ones are messed
up. And get the correct grade bolts if possible.
Although I have never had trouble with the 8.8 grade
bolts, I think next time I do this job I'll definitely
get 10.9, mostly for peace of mind.
