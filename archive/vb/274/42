Subject: Fwd: Toronto Area Beginning of Fall Bus Barbecue

Hi Volks,

Just a quick mention that if there are any Toronto-area bus pilots 
lurking on the list that we're having a "Beginning of Fall" Barbecue 
downtown at Cherry Beach tomorrow night from 6 - 10PM. Feel free to 
drop in, if you want to join us for dinner you could bring a salad or 
side dish, we're making DIY kabobs on the barbecue..

If you need directions, just send me a reply off-list.

BTW, can someone pass this along to the Vanagon List???

Happy trails,
