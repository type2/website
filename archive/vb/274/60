Subject: '61 Double Cab "Rat Rod" stuff

I've been having fun driving the '61 double cab rat around. I use it 
to go to work on nice days. I don't really like driving old busses in 
the rain...not really my deal. It usually doesn't rain out here much, 
but lately it seems we've been making up for our "10 year drought".

My passenger rear wheel has fluid all over it. I believe it's tranny 
fluid. Made a big ugly mess of my white wall tire. I seem to be 
having a tranny leak in the middle right under the tranny case as 
well. Don't know exactly where it's coming from. I need to get under 
there and check the boot on that side. It's a new boot, but was put 
on by a previous owner. Might just be loose. Could be torn...who 
knows. Would be nice if that was the culprit.

Either way a tranny replacement is gonna be due in the future. I've 
been driving around w/the bad one that came in the truck. It works 
good until 4th then grinds. So I have to keep the truck in 3rd. I'm 
OK with that, but would sure like to have that 4th gear.

I pulled the '74 THING out today and cruised around town in it to run 
the engine some. Since the new baby my wife hasn't got in it. And if 
I'm driving a VW it's been the truck. So loaded the kids up and hot 
rodded around town. MAN!!!! that THING is a blast to  drive. It 
really boogies. Makes me realize how low geared that old truck 
actually is. That truck would be a blast if it was geared more like 
the THING. Might make hauling crap a pain...don't know for sure.

Oh yeah, the other day when I was driving the truck around I "felt" a 
car full of cholos pull up next to me in their lowrider impala. 
BOOM>>>>BOOM>>BOOM>>>>>BOOM>BOOM>>>>>I could feel their dead gazes 
shooting through me. So I said what the "f" and slowly turned my head 
towards them. I kept a stone face as I turned and didn't dare move a 
muscle in it either. When I finally made eye contact with the driver, 
his head started nodding up and down. He then cracked full smile of 
pearly whites and mouthed the words "I LIKE IT". The rest of the crew 
looked like statues...their eyes barely peaking out of their old 
school thick bandanas. I gave him a slight grin, nodded back w/ one 
quick jerky up motion...and puttered away. I guess I'm at least 
looking cool enough in that old Rat Bus to be "down with the homies". 
Maybe it's time to slam this beast and then I'll REALLY have some 
"street cred".
