Also, you should put a pair of leather gloves on, and carefully, without
cutting up your fingers, pull on the bellows evenly, all around, in order
to expand their length by about a bit more than an eighth of an inch. Do
both ends, get them nice looking.

As you install each head, and after you've put on the rubber end gaskets
onto each pushrod tube, smear some high-temp Permatex Ultra-Grey (or
Black) silicone sealer around each pushrod tube gasket, line four up with
the head as you carefully push the head as far onto the studs as you can.

Then take a couple of the stud nuts and get them on the inner two lower
studs, without the washers at first, in order to start the head onto the
studs. As you get the head going on, then remove the nuts and put on their
associated special washers, as you start all the nuts and washers for that
head.

The rest of the instructions can be found in your Muir book.
