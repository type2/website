 Some of the nuts on the head, (on top, I think) seat well below the
 wider hole and the socket won't fit.  What to do?

the only time I had this problem was when I was putting the head on and it 
wasn't straight.  definately get the lower nuts on first and start them, that 
may straighten it out, as you don't ww\ant thehead tipped in at the top.   if 
the stud isn't poking through, just tighten tolower ones down a bit more and 
this will squash thehead against the push rod tubes, so the studs on top show 
past the head/washers.  dont grind the head.  I have several long sockets, all 
fit, though they may lean aginst the intake stud.  are you using a long socket?  
 short sockets will base out against the head stud.  

hope this helps.
