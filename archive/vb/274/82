Subject: RE: [VB] 6 or 12 volt tranny?

  Looking at the size of the bushing hole it looks to be a 6 volt. Also I
noticed the aftermarket t/o bearing arm REPLACE IT with a stock, it allready
looks like the bearing is off center which can cause premature wear to the
t/o baring and/or the pressure plate.
  It also appears to have been ground out to clear the 12 volt flywheel. 
  I could be wrong all around as it's really hard to tell from a picture
