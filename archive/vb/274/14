Subject: RE: [VB] Ghost in the tranny?

If it sounds like china plates clanking, that's differential unhappiness.
If it happens straight and accelerating also, suspect the fulcrum plates.

..

Hello List,
When I turn to the right and accelerate i hear a loud consistant rattling
from the transaxle area. I can't find anything wrong. It is on a 64 bus. Any

Ideas?
