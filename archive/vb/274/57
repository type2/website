Definitely have to crack the case, haven't seen a better method to change
bearings than that!

But seriously, just changing bearings at this point might only be a quick fix.
If your mains or rods are hammered you might be at a point for an align bore,
if your case proves to be crack free. I salvage 2 out of every five used
cases. Face it, they are getting old. That is why I have been, slowly, putting
together an aluminum case engine to find out how they wear. I have already
decreased the service life by having it bored to 88/90.5/92. But the thickness
of the case should prove out to be a life extender.

Yes, if you can, rebuild it. Don't forget your 500 mile retorque.

So what you guys are saying is that my 500MI roundtrip next weekend, fully
loaded, is not a good idea?  Ok, so I need new bearings.  As long as I have
the block open ( I assume I need to crack the case) Should I not just
rebuild the whole thing?  How much of a hassle is it to just do bearings?
