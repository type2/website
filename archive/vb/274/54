Underneath your nice dull gray looking new bearings, main/rod/cam, is a copper
strip. If you are seeing copper in your oil you have at least one, if not more
bearing gone and are ready for an IMMEDIATE rebuild before you burn something
up, I agree with Eric. Bearing wear will lead to excessive gap tolerances
which in turn leads to severe drops in oil pressure.

Two main places to look for bad bears, #2 main and front main, rods. You don't
want your crank hammering back and forth cracking the block or a rod bearing
spinning and burning and seizing.

Ok,

I changed my oil again last night (upgraded to a full synthetic and a bit
heavier oil)  I noticed that there is a metallic (copper) sheen to the oil.
It is pretty noticable.  I understand this is an indication of bearing wear.
How bad is this really?  should I be planning a rebuild sooner rather than
later?
