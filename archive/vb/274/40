After New Mexico we wandered up to Colorado for the Rocky Mountain Motor 
Works show in Woodland Park, CO.   After the show we traveled up to 
Parker and Denver area to visit with Cath's cousins.  We spent two weeks 
there with a trip up to Breckenridge and Frisco up high in the 
mountains.  It was great to get to visit with family and get to know the 
cousins.  We also learned a lot about fly fishing.

Philip found a tent trailer.  He has been loooking the entire trip and 
finally found just what he wanted.  It is only 295 pounds and folds out 
to an 8' by 14' room with a bed platform, table, and sitting area.  We 
took it off to the VW Busses Nowhere Near The Arch show last weekend. 
We had a great couple days and got a guided tour of Hannibal, MO from a 
couple of 'local' buskatiers.   Sunday we were rained out.  The area 
needed rain but it got a little too wet for us.  We needed a place to 
dry out so we stayed a couple days in the Lincoln Bedroom thanks to 
Buskatier Gary.  By the way ... how many Buskatiers does it take to 
start a bus??

Now we are headed west ... again.  We have stopped in Joplin MO to visit 
Philip's cousins Emma Sue and Earl.   We will probably stay a day or two 
to finish drying out - should be sunny tomorrow.  Next stop is Lubbock, 
TX then on to Jerome AZ for a VW meet.
