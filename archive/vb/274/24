Subject: 61/62 Hump back seat question.  What about the seat base????

Anyone know of there is anything special about the
seat base on a 61/62 hump back front seat?  I know the
seat back is special, but what about the base?

One of my DC's seat bases has 2 cut off tubes coming
off the back of the seat.  can not tell if they were
cut off from the factory, by the PO or if it is the
wrong seat top begin with.  

Anyone have any info on this?

Also, anyone have a pattern for the material on the
seat back? (off of the frame)

thanks

Matt
