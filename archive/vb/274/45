i have seen this bus for 3 days going south at 7ish as i am going north. i have seen 
it north of creswell and north of cottage grove i think i even saw it on the drain 
curves
is the owner on the list????
it has a full roof rack seems like it might be a passenger van but it has a little 
rear window.  haven't seen the front yet ;-))
