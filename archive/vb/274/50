Subject: Front disc conversion on '63 Ghia

Hi,

I'm converting my '63 Ghia coupe to front discs.
I have a new dual master cylinder from a later 1200/1300.
Can I use this ?

The master cylinder has 3 holes in front (left/right and brake contact)
But also 2 in the middle.  One for the rear brakes and the other ... ????

Can somebody help ?

Thanks,
Gunther
