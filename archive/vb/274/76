Subject: Disc brake link pin beams

   Well it's getting closer. Today I recieved the pics of a used Brazilian
disc brake link and king pin beams. These use 55 to 62 king pins and 64 to
67 link pins.  I am getting the arms out of one to see if they will fit into
a 64 to 67 beam and also going to check and see if just the spindles will
fit onto the existing arms.
   I really don't know what will fit on what, so when I recieve it I will
test fit the hub/rotors also to see if they would retro onto a 64-67
spindles.
   There is a warehouse in Brazil that has piles of these beams USED and if
everything works out we will bring as many as I can afford up to the U S A.
