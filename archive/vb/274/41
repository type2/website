 Hi All,
  We, 4 or 5 buses, will head out of Lake Havasu Az. at 6:00 AM Fri. the 12th.
We will stop at the Cracker Barrel Resturant in Kingman Az. at 7:00am for
breakfast.  We'll then take scenic Rt.66 to the Jerome Jamberee.  Anyone
wishing to meet with us at Havasu or Kingman please do, we would love to have
you join us.  We'll cruise at the given speed limits, no faster then 65-70mph
though where appropriate.  Any and all types welcome, even if you're not in
your VW.
  You can pmail me if you need any more info. vwdragon(-at-)citlink.net
     Thanks,
          Lou & Liz
PS. Possibly with a 'surprise rider' with us!
