Subject: RE: [VB] Brake MC clarification?

This is something I might try. Now that I am very familiar with how my brakes
work under all kinds of conditions, putting on a couple of fittings a
re-routing the lines to the opposite chamber might add some additional info.
My poor ol' Bentleys has so much red line info in it already I have to thank
the book makers for the additional blank note pages they include in each
chapter.

Hello Everyone,

referring to the rears locking up before the fronts question raised by
Adrian, I once swapped a couple of back and forth emails with Eric&Barb
about this topic.  The procedure in the type2.com  library for the 72-79 MC
swap dictates that the front brakes are hooked together in a T-fitting.
Then a short line from the T-fitting gets hooked to the rearmost threaded
boss on the MC.  The one that sticks down at a 45 deg angle.  The rear brake
line then goes into one of the front threaded bosses.  Thus, your rear
brakes are connected to the front chamber of the MC, and the front brakes
are connected to the rear chamber.  This seems couter-intuitive, but E&B
claimed that this set up would make sure the fronts locked up before the
rears.  I have not done my homework on this one, but it might have something
to do with how the brake booster is connected to the MC in the 72-79 bays.
Those with more bay window experience than me (I have none, other than
stealing parts like fuel tanks, wiring, and those cool locking front spindle
nuts from them to put on my bus) could enlighten us more.
