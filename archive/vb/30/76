Nobody's mentioned what I do for a taillight with a
bad ground.  Just replace on of the machine screws
with a slightly longer one and get a nut to fit it. 
Then just run a jumper wire from the front (fif) of
the screw to a good ground (I use the apron bolt), and
run the small nut onto the long bolt.  Works for me!
