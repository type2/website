Subject: Asking again, middle seat parts, need help please!!!

I have posted this a few times in the last few months but have had no
response, So I will ask again.
I have a 63 Samba that has a standard/kombi middle seat in it. I want to
replace me grab bar end pieces with Chrome metal ones like the ones found in
a deluxe. I am looking for someone to loan/rent me a set to make repops off
of.

I have done custom goldsmithing for close to 12 years now and would return
the originals in better than loaned condition. I will even give you a large
cash deposit to insure their safety. Please someone must be willing to help
out.

I can't believe that one of the people selling parts wouldn't want to help
out, I would be willing to reproduce them for them exclusively or let them
take the mold.
