Two years ago came back from the Classic with a buddy that had a broken
polyurethane front mount. He'd just put it in before he left Texas. We put
in a new rubber one in the driveway at my house that night. It broke just
outside of El Paso on him and he ended up finishing the trip with a chunk of
wood and a ratchet strap. Not to say yours are broke necessarily, but the
fact they are new doesn't mean they aren't anymore. He ended up going to a
steel tranny strap to get them to last. Never had that problem myself, but
some buses are funny that way. Had another buddy that had a wicked clunk. It
was one of the balls from his redux box bearings going through the gears
every now and  then. Finally blew up the redux housing. Sweet looking little
souvenir. Keep looking, the problem will reveal itself in time.
