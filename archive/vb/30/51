Through the screw, although after thirty some-odd years the hole in the body
may not always touch the screw tightly. Adding a ground wire to the bucket
always works. Closing up the holes also works. Ball peen hammer and an anvil
of some sort. Not too much, don't want to booger the screw. You just want it
so it is always in contact with one screw or the other.
