I did an oils change in my tranny and found a small
piece of metal! Not Good. I am sure that might have
something to do with my problem! 

I have checked the redux box mounting bolts TWICE
(please see my initial post) and they are tightened to
factory specs. So it is NOT those bolts, but thanks
for all of your replys. 

It could be i spun a muffler bearing or i have a
siezed pfetzer valve.
