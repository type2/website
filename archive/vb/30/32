Eric/Barb,

The difference between the spindles has to do with the mount to the backing
plate, and thus the breaks.  I do not remember the particulars off-hand, but
after 63' they changed this mount.  I upgraded my beam to get the later
spindles, so I could have more affordable brakes.

Thank you.

Hi Don,
Yes, according to the VW bus parts book we have there is a differance.  Yes,
they will fit onto a 1955-63, but if you are going for a full blown NOS or
good used resto it will be incorrect.  We do not know what the differance is
except for the part number, and no they are not part of the M216 suspension.
How much is the seller asking?  We have several sets of perfectly good used
ones to sell/trade since we have gone to the later 1964-67 suspensions in
our
1960-63 buses.   Eric&Barb
