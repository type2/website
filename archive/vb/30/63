Subject: Re: [VB] Dying at stop lights

my bus did the same thing for a while...i couldnt figure it out...large amounts of money were scrolling through my nightmares for repairs...amybe tis the same thing for you, bu twhat had happened, was that there was a alternator short that kept it from charging my battery properly. smae sypmtoms, running bad, dying at stop lights, bad idle. when it got really bad it jsut died when i was driving, and before that it wouldnt start, just  like you had left the lights on or something. good luck! give me a holler when oyu find out.
