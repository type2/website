Subject: Update on things happening here 

Hiya list, Well i'm still alive, survived the surgery on my beak. Managed to
get a sinus infection on top of it 2 weeks into recovery, didn't help
matters for sure, slowed down my recovery and getting back to work in the
shop though , as of today i'm back wide open but still fighting the sinus
infection. Kent's 56 Sunroof standard left saturday afternoon via their
trailer and a big Excursion, they were routing thru Columbus OH to pick up
some parts on the way back to St Louis. They dropped off a 56 Kombi Sunroof
as their next project in the future.
 This opened up a space in the shop for Steve Dolan's 67 westy which we'll
start probably next week. This week we are working on catching up on parts
if thats possible and this friday Mark Barnes and i intend to return the 66
21 window to Toma and Karen Keller in Elkridge MD, and pick up Patrick
Flynn's 67 westy  on the back haul.
 Hopefully i'll have the web pages updated this week as well or by next
monday anyway.
We are also working on a plan to ,if it works out to take Neil Picketts 58
Hardtop Deluxe to Mark Rafferty in Fla. in Nov and catch the Bulli Brigade
show in the process. If you have something in that area you need transported
back this direction (we'll be coming back to central NC) p-mail me and for a
fee you can get it here, grin,,. ok thats nuff said for now ,,later
