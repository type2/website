The single cab is located on Rte. 10 in Succasunna, New Jersey (western 
Morris County - about 1hr from New York City).  Easy to get there from/off 
Route 80.  On the westbound side of Rte 10 there is "10 West" car care center 
located between Eyland and Hillside Aves.  It sits out front right along Rte. 
10 and has a 63 beetle for sale next to it.  Let me know if you need better 
directions.  Good Luck.
