Hi MUD (Mad Uncle Dave),
;-)  Yes one can install a doghouse cooler on any SP fresh air system.  You 
can even install such a system in a 1960 or earlier stale air engine if you 
buy the correct after market fan shroud with all the correct fins inside the 
shroud.  For stale air 40 HP engine you have to cut off and weld the fresh 
air tubes on the dog house shroud to make it look right.   We have installed 
such several times on big bore 40 HP fresh air engines.  The only special mod 
parts needed is two or three 6/8mm studs.  You can drill and tap the engine 
case for the one stud to hold down the cooler. then replace the other two 
studs in the cooler base so you do not drill out the case hold down ears and 
weaken them.    Eric&Barb
