Check with SoCal Imports about their converted 12V wiper motors.

After several e-mails from several folks plus a few list responses it
appears that a 67 motor and brackets will not fit my bus correctly. That
means I rewind the motor or drop the voltage or find the rare 65 12 volt
system(yeah right). I will likely do the voltage drop thing since that
is the easiest and least expensive method and still satisfy my needs.
Thanks for the input from all that contributed.
