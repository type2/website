Well that is good to know because I was thinking of putting up a 3 car garage (polebarn) at our place near Spring Green,  WI.  The metal barn seems to be the fastest and most econimal to build, especially on a larger scale.  A 20'x20' (2 car) wood garage costs about $7k to build in Chicago, but I am sure that would be less in WI.  Any suggestions on any good prefab non-metal ones to store and work on buses?

american cars and with the advent of the inexpensive metal barns, his
business has been booming with mold spots on paint, seat covers and door
panels.

The problem is here in the midwest, with high humidity and cool nights the
inside of the metal barns will "sweat". Even my metal carport this morning
was dripping from the underside. Compound the problem if the barn or
storage unit has a concrete floor that also will get damp and retain
moisture.

The only types of long term storage that is safe for vehicles in climates
that are moist with cool temperatures are buildings that are made of wood,
steel buildings with a dirt or gravel floor and buildings that have climate
control.

Don't spend next spring trying to get the mold off your beloved bus,
because mold doesn't come off most of the time. You can ruin a beautiful
paint job or seat covers in just few weeks.
