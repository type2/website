Subject: repop westy racks

I know or thought I knew that PIP was not allowed to
sell racks for any other VW's cause they got a
contract to do them exclusively for the NB. But does
anyone know if anyone else is offering them. The
reason I ask is because on the auction site there have
been four re-pop westy racks on in the last week. I
asked one seller if this was an old PIP that he never
put together, he said it wasn't, but did not tell who
the manufacturer was, just that it was Chinese. After
the one he had sold, he had placed another auction for
another rack. So, does anyone know if these are
recently being made again, and know of the quality?
 Mike
