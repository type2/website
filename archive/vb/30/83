Hi Craig,
Of course it is your engine and bus.  We would just rebuild it and not have 
any worries out on the road.  Plus if you install a CW crank and full flow 
filter/oil pump it will have a few more HP, smoother quieter engine, and the 
cam/main/rod bearings will last alot longer than stock.   Eric&Barb
