Yes, I have an opinion. I will be in Vegas Thursday and Friday, and will
turn up my nose, head to the airport, and fly back to Albuquerque where my
bus is waiting. Drove it over this last weekend specifically so I wouldn't
be stuck going to the Vegas show. That and because anyone you would want to
see will be in Albuquerque. I even heard they don't have balloons at the
Vegas show.
