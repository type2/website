Subject: Re: [VB] Personal lawsuit?

Thanks for all the input on this topic.

The new owner really had no intent to ever pursue action legally but it's
nice to know that was really his only course of action after receiving a
flat out "no" answer to several requests for some sort of refund.

Unfortunately, the vehicle was inspected before purchase by a highly
reputable source (not me, ha-ha).  It just turned out that the mechanicals,
while they appeared to be in order, were very slipshod and several
brake/engine/transmission issues surfaced within a week or two of ownership.

Oh well, these things happen...

Thanks again,
Everett
