Dear Clara,
This list has weathered a lot in the past few weeks. But the news, that
Clara will not be helping us out with her expertise in the future, is a
real blow....she said it all with her short, pithy remarks, and
remarkable knowledge.  
I, for one, will miss her input....the list will not be the same....
