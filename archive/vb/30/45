Peerless tires has a 205-75-15 Ambassador style radial $25.00 each. I have 
them on my 62 panel with 5K miles on them. Barry and JP from the bus co-op in 
Albuq. also use this brand and size and have been real happy with the 
Ambassador. Peerless also has one called the President that sells for around 
$32.00 each.
