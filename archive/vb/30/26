Subject: NOS spindles/kingpins etc

I need to replace these on my '61 panelvan.  I have a located a seller that
has complete NOS setups that include the spindles, king pins, link pins,
needle bearings, grease nipples etc.  His ad says they are VW part #'s 211
405 301C and 211 405 302C and that they are for chassis # 999305 to 1 144
281.  I thought these were all basically the same with some modifications
for 1964 and up.  Why wouldn't these fit a 1961, chassis # 646230???????
Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks, Don.
