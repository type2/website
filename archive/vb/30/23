I believe john found what he did and im sure Ill get to check it out soon.
but isnt it strange that the original owner would cut up their truck after
only having owned it for 1 year????????? talk about a disgruntled customer!
I dunno - think about buyin a new car these days, if your the OG owner you
get pissed if it even gets scratched, let alone take a sawzall and start
cutting body sections off it. A second owner on a high mileage vehicle well
ok maybe - but og owner after a year? sheesh 'WtF were they thinking'
?!?!?!? Desert racing i suppose.......
