Roger, and I thought we were friends. You're
persuading people to go to a show other than ours here
in New Mexico!

Actually, I went to the Las Vegas show the year before
we started having Busses and Balloons, and if you
don't mind a loud (drag racing), expensive (ala
Bug-O-Rama) type show, it's OK.  The swap was great
the year we went, but that's dependent on the vendors
each year.  I'm not fond of the loud, expensive shows,
but it's a lot closer to California for those of you
not willing to explore the excitement of breaking down
miles from nowhere in the desert of Arizona or New
Mexico!  (Just kidding - wish you were coming to
Busses and Balloons.)  
And don't forget, driving from anywhere to
Albuquerque, you get a FREE LUNCH Saturday from our
Sponsor Foreign Aide!!!

Again, pmail me for details!
