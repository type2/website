Subject: Storage Warnings

A bit of a warning about storage.  I have a friend who restores older
american cars and with the advent of the inexpensive metal barns, his
business has been booming with mold spots on paint, seat covers and door
panels.

The problem is here in the midwest, with high humidity and cool nights the
inside of the metal barns will "sweat".  Even my metal carport this morning
was dripping from the underside.  Compound the problem if the barn or
storage unit has a concrete floor that also will get damp and retain
moisture.

The only types of long term storage that is safe for vehicles in climates
that are moist with cool temperatures are buildings that are made of wood,
steel buildings with a dirt or gravel floor and buildings that have climate
control.

Don't spend next spring trying to get the mold off your beloved bus,
because mold doesn't come off most of the time.  You can ruin a beautiful
paint job or seat covers in just few weeks.
