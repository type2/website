I have a set of Goodyear G64s (195/75/15 8ply) on my 63 camper.  Recently 
I've had a slow leak in one of them and the Goodyear near me said they 
can't get the G64 anymore, so I'd have to go for a Dunlop if the tire 
needed replacement.  I'm assuming these are the same Dunlops.  I think that 
size would be fine on a stock bus.
