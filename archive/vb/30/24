Well, if she owned it and never licensed it for over 40 years because it was
only used offroad, I would say that it more than likely happened on her
watch. At some point her or a son may have decided some big old tires would
be a good idea. Probably getting it stuck in the south 40. I bet you could
find the pieces around there if you looked, with a rusty pair of tin snips
and the original tires and wheels laying on the ground beside them.
