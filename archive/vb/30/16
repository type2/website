Subject: original-style Pedal Pads

A little tale of part-scrounging for the anal-retentive (like me):

I take my little VW victories whenever I can get them, and one of my
latest was... pedal pads.  When I got my doublecab and made my first 'to
do' list, I noticed that the original pedal pads were typically worn and
cracked.  These pads had a special part number, 111-721-173, and a
square notch in the bottom to make them easier to slip on.  Shopping
around for replacements at VW shows and in catalogs, all the new and
used pads that I found (this is the East Coast, remember) were the
slightly smaller kind with a 311- part number.  They didn't fit quite
right.  Or else they were the slightly larger, trapezoidal-shaped ones
like my wife's '79 Beetle came with.  Not really a big deal, eh?  So I
just kept this odd part number on file, and waited.

Until I finally found a set!  At a little VW show earlier this month
tucked into the northeastern corner of Maryland.  With barely 4 flea
market vendors.  Just as I was about to write off the trip as far as my
Scrounge List was concerned, what should appear in the last vendor's
display but a pair of good condition Brazilian pads with the correct
part number.  Woo hoo!

OK, so nobody within a 100-mile radius of my location would even notice
the difference, but it gave me a warm and fuzzy feeling to finally check
off another 'to do' on my bus list.  Anybody else out there notice this
difference in pedal pads?  Or care?  (Just a rhetorical question, I
guess.)
