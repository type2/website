Very true.  It is used primarily for extra oil and to prevent oil
starvation.

This is true, but to what extent does this harm the engine?  I am sure if
this was a big problem there would be few if any busses rolling around on
the highway today.  

For a stock engine I would not bother with a deep sump.  Only if I was
running an external oil cooler (with 180F thermostat switch) would I put a
sump on my engine.  The extra tuning and cooler would make additional oil
demands on the system which could take away from the crankcase oil supply if
it is too small.  

Just for reference I do not run or need the extra cooler or deep sump for my
engine.  If you need extra cooling I would evaluate the current cooling
system and see what may not be working quite right...  Normally I travel
heavily loaded (read camping trips) and can just vary my speed to the
outside heat and keep it as cool as needed.  Normally I start to back off if
it hits 220F, which is very rare.  Also I try not to run harder than
3500-3600RPM = 55-60 MPH  (according to Bentley 65 is 4000 RPM)....  Hey I
never said I went anywhere fast :)
