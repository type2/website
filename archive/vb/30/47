Thanks to a helpful reminder from Jim!  The information is available from
Old Volks Home.


> In theory I think when timed at 7.5 BTDC w/o vacuum the with vacuum timing
should be around 10 BTDC and when revved at 3500RPM should come out to 30-32
degrees   BTDC....? 

From www.oldvolkshome.com :
Timing Set At:: 7.5deg BTDC Static or (-at-) 800-950rpm w/strobe and vacuum hose
disconnected and plugged
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum (Advance Only): 17-19deg (-at-) 1.3 In. Hg, 24-28deg
(-at-) 3.2 In. Hg

(matches 205 dizzy from VW installations) and hopefully the vacuum from the
carb will be correct..?

Have to still check on the carb situation though.
