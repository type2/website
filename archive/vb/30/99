Subject: 40 HP intake gaskets??


Hey all,
I am in the process of putting the 40 HP engine back together, and I'm almost there! Anyway, heres a question: Was there supposed to a gasket between the intake manifold and the heads? There was none when I took the manifold off, and I have been looking in the parts catalogs and I can't seem to find this particular gasket for a 40 HP. Is it possible that ther is not supposed to be a gasket here, or is it just missing, and if so, where can I get a couple of these?
