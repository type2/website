Thanks Kyle and Jim. With all of Mikes wisdom he must have forgot that hoops
and tilts were an m-code option and they did not come with this pickup. The
lady who I bought the bus from is in her 80's and bought the bus when she
was around 40 if you backtrack dates on title. She said she cut the
wheelwells to get around the mines she and her 1st husband ran. Said she
could leave jeeps behind. She also said she thought the cut pieces might
still be around somewhere, and by the looks of her place I don't think she
ever through anything away so maybe they are still around! If you think the
pickup was a find you should see the original very, very early other VW  she
has, Go with that one Mike, and damn the hoops! She said it was not for sale
now and was having a vw motor rebuilt on "the coast" for it now. Thats the
story and I'm sticking to it.
