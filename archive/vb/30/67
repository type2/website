Hi Todd,
OK, on alot of the bulb holders are pressed/riveted into the bulb reflector 
(So this mean one connection that can be bad.), others of these buldholders 
and reflectors are cast together out of potmetal.  Then there is a tiny spear 
point rivet popped (Another place a bad ground connection can happen!) into 
the rear rim of the reflector.  This spear point is made to pass through a 
tiny premade hole in the tail light seal and dig through the paint and into 
the metal of the body to ground the tailight (Which is the biggest ground 
failure normally.).  Best to drill and screw onto the cast type bulb 
holder/reflector and on the pressed in bulbholder soldeer on a ground wire.  
Either way ground both ground wires from these tailights to the battery 
ground strap.   Eric&Barb
