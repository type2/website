Subject: Re: [VB] Grounding tailight

  This is some good advice, I like it much better than 
drilling my pristine housings for some non-stock

  Uh-oh am I turning into David Mayes?? - Quick, someone 
send me a "261 555 123C Muffler Bearing seal" for my DC! 
It must say "VW" and be NOS or perfect!!!!
