Subject: FW: This Sunday---Naked Car show !!!!  and now the Naked Truth

The naked Truth is---It was a very entertaining Car Show. Every car was
naked, lots of people with and without cloths and everyone having a grand
time. Beautiful setting , trees , pool, hot tub, DJ. If you do not want to
do the car show, then it is only two bucks to walk in. T-Shirts that come
with the entry fee are very kool.  Magoo and I really enjoyed the scenery,
got a little warm out there, and hit the pool at home. Temp is up to 74
Degrees. Stay tuned right here for a Free car show, with a free raffle, and
free food. Lots of good stuff coming up with a possible FREE bar b que at a
VW dealership. No need to sulk around , get into your VW and enjoy life, uj
