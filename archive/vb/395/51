Subject: Re: [VB] Re-installing vent wing glass..

I used my old rubber. I put black weatherstrip adhesive on the inside and  
out of the old rubber and then slide the glass in. Later after drying I got a  
razor blade and cleaned the extra off the glass. I tried using the new stuff 
but  wow it wouldn't go. Then someone suggested that I use an old bicycle inner 
tube.  I still had problems getting it on so I went to the first way I wrote 
up top.  You might have better luck with the others I didn't. Good luck
