I think some people have successfully used a Black and Decker "Workmate"
workbench to do this.  The top of a Workmate has a clamping action
similar to the VW special tool.  Searching the archives (at
http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus ) with "workmate glass" reveals
some likely hits:

In one of the above, Ronnie at Old Volks said he was going to take some
pictures of installing the glass and rubber with a Workmate.  Ronnie,
if you're listening, do you have a link to the photos?
