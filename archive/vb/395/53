I Love this idea, but why dont we broaden the scope of the hubcap
journey,

I live in South Africa, and I would love to do this here to,

Maybe we could also start a hubcap here take it from east to west of our
country and then fly it to the US??



Whatever you decide I think I will speak to Fig about doing this in SA



Thanks for the Idea
