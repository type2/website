Vids...

 

The quest for more speed goes on and VW seems to be at the head of the pack,
considering they own the Bugati marque.  The first clip is a 7+ minute vid
of the new Veyron from Bugati in an attempt to break 407 KPH (253 MPH for
those to the left of the big pond).  fortunately, they have the track at
Ehra Lessin to exercise this (drive-it-like-ya-stole-it) insanity.

VW seems to have gone to the Yo, Yo, Pimp My Ride Side!!  The second set of
vids are new ads that are worth a guffaw or two, especially the one
featuring the trebuchet!!  Enjoy and laugh like hell.
