Subject: front disc brakes

Vdub engineering out of Toronto, ON sells a kit to install 944 front disc
brakes on a early bus.  It bolts on where the stock backing plates
installs.  I'm trying to determine what the change in width from hub face to
hub face  vs stock drum.  Anybody here on the list used this kit before?
