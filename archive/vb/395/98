Subject: Re: Re-installing vent wing glass..

I've used pipe clamps .. with a piece of soft wood between the clamp and the 
frame and piece of wood between the glass and the clamp - I think I might 
have used two pieces of wood on one of the sides offset a bit so that it was 
squarish .. worked great.
