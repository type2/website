Subject: Unofficial EveryBus Shirts now on sale

Hi Volks,

Once again my buddy Adam has decided to subsidize his VW adventures  
by cranking out some cool event shirts. And as usual they are looking  
pretty good, and the prices are very reasonable.

What's different this year is that he now has an online store set up  
(no, it's NOT CafePre$$) , and he has arranged for outside  
manufacturing and distribution so as to ensure that the shirts arrive  
on time regardless of whether he does.  (Anyone who has camped with  
Adam knows what I'm talking about.)  Heck, this year you can even  
have your shirt shipped to you BEFORE the event if you want to.  One  
other thing is that we're not just talking T-shirts.... Adam has also  
offered girly-shirts, zippered Hoodies & hats too.

Get your wallet or piggy bank out at the ready and click the

Happy Trails,
