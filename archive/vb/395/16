Subject: 64 seat options

Okay another question for the experts. Anybody seen a pre 67 bus with front
seats that had the back head rests? What year bus had seats with that
option? The wife insists on some safety upgrades to our bus, seat belts and
head rests in the event that we get hit from behind. Buckets seats from a
walk thru would work if they had the supports. Also, has anybody put seat
belts in? Would I need to install some mounts or are they already there
somewhere?

Thanks

Dave
