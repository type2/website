Subject: I WANT YOUR MONEY!!!  FIFTEEN LUCKY CAMPERS NEEDED ASAP!

Well, it's not for me specifically, it's for Buses Of the Corn.

Today I received the bill for the campground fees, the Conservation  
Authority requires they be paid in advance to hold a reservation.
In order to cover this cost, I will allow the first 15 reservations  
to book their stay at BOTC for just FIFTEEN CANADIAN DOLLARS.  Once  
the first 15 weekend passes are sold, the price will be going up.

The Date: August 10th - 12th, 2007.

The Place: Heber Down Conservation Area, Just north of Whitby  
Ontario, a half-hour or so east of Toronto.

The Happenings: Burrito Breakfast, Tie-Dye Workshop, Frisbee Golf,  
Swap Meet, Driving Competition, Bocce Ball, Corn Roast & Campfire. We  
pride ourselves on having something for everyone. (Except a car show).

The Website: www.busesofthecorn.com

Remember: American citizens don't need a passport to drive to Canada  
for BOTC. You might need one by 2008, but not this year.

How to pay: visit the website for details. If you're sending $$ by  
paypal, please add one extra dollar to help me cover the transaction  
fees.

NOTE: Please respond via p-mail if you intend to take advantage of  
this offer. I will let the lucky 15 know ASAP and announce that the  
offer is closed.

All payments are non-refundable, but if you choose to transfer your  
registration to a third party that's fine by me.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
