David,
Don't know about the head rests. I would guess that was an aftermarket deal.
As for seat belts, my non-walkthru has seat belts installed by the dealer 
and they have the Wolfburg emblem on them. I guess it was an option in 64. 
There is a standard length for the driver and an extra long set to go around 
2 passengers in the 2/3 seat. Safety? Well in 1964 it was. Really should 
have a belt per passenger. There are also belts installed for the rear 
passengers that can sit in the fold down camper bed/seat.

The belts are held in with some interesting seat belt bolts. Kinda like an 
eye bolt. I can send you a photo if you want. Let me know.
Under the floor there are large thick fender washers for reinforcement.
