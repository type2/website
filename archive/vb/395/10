PUBLIC INVITED 

The Arizona Automobile Hobbyist Council has served the Hobbyists of AZ for
three decades and have been very effective in beating back the ongoing
threats that could severely hurt our HOBBY or completely destroy it. We have
been on the job as your watchdog for our HOBBY to take on the challenges of
scrappage proposals, new vehicular taxes, aggressive zoning laws,
anti-cruising efforts and many other issues that would harm our HOBBY.
