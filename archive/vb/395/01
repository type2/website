Subject: VW on LOST!

Right now the big guy on lost just found a key on a  dead guys dried up arm
and it sure looks like a VW key!  Then right now before the first  commercial
he found a car on its side!  IT looks like a VW bus!  Tune in and find out!
Probably a Bay!  You can also watch on abc.com!
