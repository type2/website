Subject: Concours judging form

hi all,

I'm a regular judge at one of our local shows each year and I'm putting
together a new judging form so I can make judging easier and more
consistent.

I'd appreciate you opinions about categories and grading descriptors,
but I've put the form together in Word so I'll probably need to send it
to anyone who wants to help.

Anyone interested ?

thanks

Lee
