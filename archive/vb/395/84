Hi Matt,
Engine cold, tranny in nuetral helps.  Then you can easily check end  play by 
pulling/pushing the crank pulley.  Doing this with someone pushing  on the 
clutch will result in all that pressure pushing the FW, crank, rear  pulley 
assembly back and not allow you to push it forward.
 
Hey P&C,
What kind of lower pulley was it that cracked on you volks?
