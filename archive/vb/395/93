MORAL: Adjust the belt TWICE
   
  I have had this same problem on and off for years.  I think I finally came up with the idea that my crankshaft pulley had to be bent, since only that long block ever failed.  This, of course, sounds nuts, since the failure was on a part unrelated to the block, but that is where I got the idea about the crank pulley.  I had a problem with the woodruff key making the slot in the alternator into an oval.  This kills not only the cheap pulley, but a just-purchased alternator (even tried a few generators) too.  
   
  In my experiences though, I did find that the belt had to be readjusted.  I was told, like the post confirms, that the belt was adjusted too tight.  So I took the greatest of care to be sure that it was exactly within tolerances.  A thousand miles later, I was replacing the pulley.  Turns out, you really have to keep watching that belt.  If your ride has the habit of throwing a pulley, keep an eye on the tighteness every hundred miles or so.  Chances are, you'll be playing the shims game more than once.  
   
  Incidentally, another potential problem area I dismissed while troubleshooting was how the alternator sat on the pedestal.  Sometimes you have a little play front and back, especially with an aftermarket (thinner metal, thus easier to warp) fan shroud.  For example, in a pinch I once stopped the rubbing of the fan on the inside of the shroud by loosening the clamp and pushing the alternator toward the front (FIF).  I suppose if it's so easy to move the whole unit, and this misalignment with the crank pulley could indeed throw the pulley, confirming it sits right where it should is worth the look.
