Subject: Re: [VB] Speedo Cellophane

Hi Rennie,
Try any place that sells and/or rents light/sound systems for bands.   The 
local rental one here gave us some spotlighting "cell" material that we  used in 
our speedos.

The BA7s LED bulbs near the bottom of that fits Porsche, and other  Euro 
automobiles.  Can be bought in white for illuminating the speedo, or  for the 
idiot lights use the green & red colored ones.
