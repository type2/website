So I'm catching up on the VB list mail and I read this message:

Immediately after that, I read this one

and I think, "Why would you want to put colored plastic in your swimming
trunks?"  Then I figured out Rennie is talking about a speedometer.
(Besides, if you want swimming trunks with see-through panels, you can
buy them ready-made... OK, you probably didn't want that picture in your
head.) Some notes on getting the colored plastic are here:

But they don't come in 6 V.  :)  Also, while these would work fine for
general illumination and the indicators for turn, high beam, and oil
pressure, I wonder how well they would work for the generator warning
light.  The original lamp is specified at 1.2 W - this is 0.2 A (-at-) 6 V
or 0.1 A (-at-) 12 V.  An LED draws more like 0.02 A (-at-) 12 V - about five
times less.  The reason you care is that the voltage regulator may be
using the current coming through the warning light to help start up the
charging system.  Installing a lamp that reduces this current greatly
may affect the charging system.  It probably won't totally fail to
charge, but it might cut in later and cut out sooner - no problem if
you're on the highway but not so good in the city.
