Subject: Re-installing vent wing glass..

Hello All,

  I wanted to use the original rubber to install my vent wing glass but am
noticing that you have to use a special VW press to get it in there?  Does
anyone have any good experience with using any other techniques?  Also,
because thru the years the channel is not perfect, would it be better to use
modern sealant so that it can waterproof the seal much better, and forget
about the original rubbers?  Do the original rubbers keep them watertight if
they're a little pitted here and there?  As always, thanks for any input or
advice.  Aloha,  J
