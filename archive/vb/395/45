Subject: Re: [VB] front disc brakes

I put on a '69 beam, added the disc brake spindles and 924S hubs.  When I
laid this all out, I could've used a spacer behind the assembly, but it
moved the hub out a little farther than I liked.  I ended up using a jig
grinder and grinding the spindle down.  Then I added early 911 rotors with a
.400" spacer.  That put the rotor perfectly in the center of the 73 - up
calipers.  Now I run Fuchs alloys w/o adapters or spacers.

It's kind of lucky that some of the Porsches used the same wheel bearings as
our buses.  It is a little bit more work because the bearings are closer
together than on a bus.

Having access to a machine shop is a nice perk, but a good machine shop
could make up a kit like this.
