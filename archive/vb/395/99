In almost every case I have seen over the years, the number of shims is the
culprit.  I was taught that 9 is the minimum and 12 the maximum.  This was
given to me when there were much higher quality aftermarket shims available.

I have yet to see a nut stripped from over-tightening.

Or put simply, the front pulley half is now two pieces, a large radius metal
disk and a small radius metal disk.
