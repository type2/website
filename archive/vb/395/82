We do not know the part number for our under size generator pulley but 
if it was the stronger one then that is why the lower pulley cracked.
P & C

Tom, while I don't have an answer to the cause of the problem, you might
investigate using a Porsche "356" pulley. It is stronger and SLIGHTLY
smaller, resulting in better cooling. Ted
