Subject: VW's New Bus hijacked?

Since it's Friday and Thom could replace caffeine with adrenalin, I'll throw 
this out...

The H*nda Element is the New Bus, they beat VW to it. 
A lot of parallels to the original T2, but with air bags, modern stuff. 
1. It's homely
2. Small outside, big inside
3. Proven drivetrain from other lines, no excess HP
4. Cheap (18k-21k)
5. Boatloads of passenger cars sold, loyal customers
6. Great dealership support
7. Appeals to young people
8. Rear windows pop out
9. Camping gear available
10. Same 'minuses' as T2, road noise & skittish in winds
11. Utilitarian, flexible seating & easy cleanup
etc.

Unless VW's New Bus can hit more than 5 of the above including #4, I'd say 
H*nda is going to move a lot of these!
