Subject: fuel cut-off valve

I'm in need of an in-line electric fuel cut-off valve.
I've cobbled together my BN4 heater with an aftermarket electric fuel
pump and adjusted flow with a brass needle valve but I'm nervous about
installing it without a positive cut-off in there.
Does anyone know of a source for such an animal?
Thanks
