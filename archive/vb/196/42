Subject: Mystery Wheels

I de-tired and sand-blasted 5 wheels today in preparation for painting and installing new tires. 
It wasn't until I was getting ready to paint them that I noticed that 1 wheel was different. 
Hmmm. Turns out, that wheel appears to be *normal* and the other 4 are different. The have more 
negative offset than the others. All 5 are marked 4 1/2K 15

Even more interesting is the fact that they were a yellowish-orange (ala Dave bucket truck) 
underneath some generic rattle-can black. 

They also have a very pronounced KPZ (KronPrinz) logo. 

I got these in the big Rio Linda junkyard sale. 

Any ideas? Pix (-at-)
