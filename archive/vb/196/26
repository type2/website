Subject: aluminum case update

so the motor is in the car and running... but has a problem:
  we took a listening tube and spent an hour tracking a loud noise in 
the aluminum engine. DEFINITELY internal,  along the lifter area on 
the right side. either something is banging into the case, or the 
(solid) lifters have a problem on the pushrod end. i clearanced, 
miked and decked the hell outa this motor, so if its a clearance 
issue, it is due to a nonspec case.

it SOUNDS like it is ONCE per valve opening...  not as fast as the 
engine rpms.  perhaps a lifter is hitting something; or while the 
pushrods are not FLEXING as bad as EX #1 once did, but still one is 
not right in the lifter cup, and is rattling around.
if i take the pushrods off of each cylinder in turn, the noise should 
go away IF the pushrods are the problem (do i pull the sparkplug on 
that cylinder for this test, or just the wire)?
if the noise doesn't go away, i;m f*cked. no tips for the holidays :P

other than that, it runs great :)  i have a 30/31 on it now that 
won't hold an even idle, so i ordered a new one - i'm sick of 
screwing with worn carbs!  later on i'll try and find out why the 
30P1 i had rebuilt wouldn't even idle on this motor....

main is 125, air jet is 130y, pilot and idle jets are 50s. runs rich, 
but not TOO bad. i'll eventually try a 122.5, and then a 125 and a 
135z, and see which setup i like better.  runs strong despite the 
noise!
