Subject: salt and peppa resto

Hi All-

A DPO decided to improve on the factory salt and peppa interior panels on my
65 bus by painting over the original colour scheme with grey and black
paint. eech. It appears to be spray painted on.:P

Any suggestions how to get this paint off?

I tried acetone on a test area where you would never see and it took off the
respray paint and the original too :P

Any thoughts would be appreciated. Yes I am an originality nut I realize
that TMI repops these
