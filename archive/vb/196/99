Subject: "Tis The Season"--

Tis the Season to be nice to your bus
  A gift or two, would not be a fuss
  Showing your love from all of us---

Whether the Weather is cold or warm
  Go out and Start your bus, it will do it no Harm
  For Your bus waits for you, outside, or in the barn--

Share your love with others, during this most precious Season
  To Show your love, you Never need a reason
  Let us All help every Person
  Let us all Spread our Love--for it Is--"Tis the Season"
