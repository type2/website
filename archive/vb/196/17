Beauty is in the eye...

As big as it can get with crush space.

I measured, and the exterior dimensions are within a couple of inches of
my bay in length and height.  It is 5 inches wider, though.

160HP would be a screamer in a bus!

Well, after the Honda dealers stop putting the "Additional Markup"
stickers on.

An aging customer base, hence the "college geek" target market for this.

Depends.  Some Honda dealers are great, some are arrogant SOBs.

And older folks too.  Even though this was billed as a "mobile dorm room",
I bet they sell more to the 30+ crowd.

Didn't like that.  Had to be that way to make room for the B-pillar
structure in the rear doors.

No kidding!  There is a tent that clips onto the rear hatch.  Not as nice
as a Westy tent, but still...

Yes, but only to those who aren't used to buses.  I'll bet that a bus
pilot wouldn't notice the noise or crosswinds.

Seating is only for four, darnit.  I do like the rubber mats and
anti-stain fabric in the seats.

That they will.  My wife wants to look at one.  I feel an expense coming
on.

The bus stays, though.  No negotiation there.
