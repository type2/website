As b/w increases, CPU speeds increase, and storage and memory become 
cheaper, images get bigger, executables become less efficient, and
s/w packages get larger.  When I was your age, I would take the most-used
chunks of my code, re-write them in assembler, and inline them.  Mention
that to one of these kids today and you'll get a blank look. 

Only about 98% of the internet-using population compose the elite 
computer illiterati, who have no clue about image formats, file sizes
and the like, because SOL^H^H^HAOL and M$ have spoon-fed it to them
so they don't have to.  Analogy: just because your mom let you sit in
the front seat of the car and make vroom-vroom noises, doesn't mean
you're qualified to drive.

Sorry Jim, while your modem is capable of 56k, the POTS isn't.  I recommend
DSL.  Cable will be zippy fast, until everyone on your block has
it, at which case you'll be down to 56k speeds again.

The HP cafeteria is closed today, so I'm deprived of my coffee and donuts,
making me grumpy.
