Hi Tom,
Definitely check the rims to make sure they are bus ones!!!!!  NOV63 and 
later buses used a 14 inch rim.  If they are bus you can go with a 205/75R15, 
but make sure the tires are rated for at LEAST 1525 Lbs. as stated in the VW 
bus shop manual or risk having him randomly change lanes in side winds or 
when semis are passing him on the highway.  You can go as big as 235/75R15s 
on the rear axle to reduce top cruising RPM to get better MPG and double 
engine life by keeping the top cruising RPM to 3,000 RPM.  Buy/beg/borrow a 
tach for a fifteen minute drive to check where 1,500 and 3,000 RPMs are in 
each forward gear.  Never go below 1,500 RPM which lugs the engine and only 
above 3,000 for short spurts especially to keep from going below 1,500 RPM 
when upshifting.
  We have been plotting of trying a taller Cooper 195/82R15 tire for our 
pre-1964 buses due to the lower and tighter inner folded lip in the rear 
wheel wells.  These were suggest by a fellow vintagebusser who's name eludes 
us!  He said these were for Range Rover and availible for $300.00 for four.
