It kind of sounds like the top of the lifter bores needed to be decked and
chamfered like you do for after market high lift cams.

Subject: [VB] aluminum case update


so the motor is in the car and running... but has a problem:
  we took a listening tube and spent an hour tracking a loud noise in
the aluminum engine. DEFINITELY internal,  along the lifter area on
the right side. either something is banging into the case, or the
(solid) lifters have a problem on the pushrod end. i clearanced,
miked and decked the hell outa this motor, so if its a clearance
issue, it is due to a nonspec case.

it SOUNDS like it is ONCE per valve opening...  not as fast as the
engine rpms.  perhaps a lifter is hitting something; or while the
pushrods are not FLEXING as bad as EX #1 once did, but still one is
not right in the lifter cup, and is rattling around.
if i take the pushrods off of each cylinder in turn, the noise should
go away IF the pushrods are the problem (do i pull the sparkplug on
that cylinder for this test, or just the wire)?
if the noise doesn't go away, i;m f*cked. no tips for the holidays :P

other than that, it runs great :)  i have a 30/31 on it now that
won't hold an even idle, so i ordered a new one - i'm sick of
screwing with worn carbs!  later on i'll try and find out why the
30P1 i had rebuilt wouldn't even idle on this motor....

main is 125, air jet is 130y, pilot and idle jets are 50s. runs rich,
but not TOO bad. i'll eventually try a 122.5, and then a 125 and a
135z, and see which setup i like better.  runs strong despite the
noise!
