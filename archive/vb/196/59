Somewhere I picked up a couple of 15" wide 5 chrome rims that weren't wide 
fives, but same width as 15" bus rims.  They had the series of ovals round 
the edge like 67 bug rims though.  I planned on putting them on my 61, but 
the offset was too far out.   They were dated sometime in 65.   I was told 
they were 356 rims, but have no idea if it's true.

 It very clearly says "56"
