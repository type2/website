A common hack in the Hippie Days and even the CalLook 80s was to 
hack out the seat bulkhead in a bench seat bus and bolt in some
sano 914 or Honduh seats.  Such was the fate of my double cab. 
They put in a particle board bottom so the seats could sit level,
and then cut a big hole in it - and the compartment underneath -
so they could install a DIN-sized stereo.  Bitchin', dude!

So I fixed it, in my own special way.  I'm nowhere near done, 
still have some more trimming and fitting, but I'm about 90% there.  
3 days of cutting, trimming, and even a little sand-blasting.  I might
be ready to weld by xmas.

Awaiting your reaction with bait-like breath.
