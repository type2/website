Hi Tom,
The overall diamension should be the same from 1955-67 wiper arms.  Only the 
base changed in some slight ways over this time.  Check that the wiper arms 
have not been shoved into the bases too much or perhaps DPO cut the wiper 
arms shorter for some reason.  As for when the bases went from the longer 
casting to the shorter we are not sure when this happened, but believe it did 
not occur before the 1964 model year.
