Subject: pricing a VW to sell?

Hi, I know this isn't a splitty question, but my mom's selling her 67 bug 
(due to back issues she got an automatic) and isn't sure what to ask for it.  
It's a nice one, I mean she's the second owner and the first owner took it to 
the dealer every 3K for a tune up (it's stamped in the manual) and the 
interior's really clean and the original radio works, recent paint, tires, 
etc.  Who should I ask about this?  Bug is in the Bay Area.
