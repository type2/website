Using a tumbler works great, though I would not run it in a cutting
compound for more then 2 to 3 hours (depending on how crusty the parts
are). Afterwards I like to change the media in the tumbler to stainless
steel shot and burnish the parts over night. this gives the parts a
super finish without removing any more material.
 
I guess If anyone would like the specs on the cut media or burnishing
media I use just ask and I will look it up. I have been a part time
jeweler for close to 12 years now and use my tumblers daily for
everything imaginable.
