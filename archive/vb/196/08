Regarding creation of effective VW sales ads:

VW I have to admit that seeing the corrected photos next to the others, it is
hard to tell which is what. The main difference can be seen when viewed at the
full size. The physical size of my "corrected" photos is about .5 of the OG
ones, are a fraction of the kb size and are a bit sharper. Adobe Photoshop
<tm.> or possible other freebie/shareware softwares that come with scanners and
digital cameras would "possibly" do the same/similar compressions as does Adobe
Image Ready etc.
DSL vs. Cable, Single port vs. Dual port etc? yeah, OK- I will check into it
all... All that I know is that dialup blows the duck.
Ellis, a young whippersnapper? acting like one, FEELING like one? Yeah probably
prior to the kids but TRUST ME~ I feel like I'm rode hard and put away, um...
well let's just say *nothings* been wet in a long time... I used to feel and
act like an 18 year old but now feel like I've been on the receiving end of the
10th Mtn. Division in bad weather. Look sound and feel like Walter Brennan in
high humdity w/o grandma's roomitizz medicine.
I have the next two weeks off so perhaps I can rest up and find grandma's stash
jug and finally have time to work on the '63 bus. =)
