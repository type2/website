I know that's a screwed up link, but go to www.eastwoodco.com and then click
on buffing and finishing.  They have the vibrating tumbler system (should it
be called a tumbler if it doesn't "tumble"??) and different media's for it.
Even better, do a search at their site for tumbler, and they have an ECONOMY
version for much cheaper ($59.99).
