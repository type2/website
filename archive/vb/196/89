Hi Al,
No they would not, they would however have the interior finless exhaust tubes 
running through the heat exchangers.  The main fit problem between 1200 and 
1500 and later engines is the distance between the heads and thusly the 
muffler width between heat exchangers.
E model muffler would be for 1960 thru 1963 here in the USA.  J model was 
used in 1963 1500 one ton option buses and in all standard buses from 1964 
till 1967 here in the USA.
As far as 34HP Vs. 40HP they are the same thing.  34 DIN Bhp is the Euro 
measurement and the 40 SAE HP is the USA measurement of the same engine!
