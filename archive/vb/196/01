Thursday PM I down loaded a few photos from the "NEW" ad for the 65 6V bug.

Thank goodness, I am about to reconvert back to cable modem. For the past year
I had been trying to save a buck via using the supposed 56k dial up. What a
total PITA!  (cut my nose to spite my face...)

Sellers of vehicles and other items that are to be posted on the internet need
to pay attn to the size and optimization of the photos that they include with
the ads. Not everyone has cable or DSL! At 28.8kb or what I was getting last
night (21.4kb!!!!) large photos with distinct color shifting can discourage
potential customers. Sellers should not expect *Bay or theSAMBA to fix your ad.

I optimized and color corrected a few of the photos and have asked Everett to
repost them into that ad. Hopefully Everett will have some time soon to upload
them. See if you can tell which ones were fixed. Allow time to have the pix
changed out. Perhaps later this afternoon or this evening...
The ad seems to feature/offer a fairly nice bug at a price sure to fit someones
budget and tastes. Sellers need to do all that they can to help themselves.
Appropriately descriptive text and sufficient number of photos can help make
the sale~ especially in a tight market.
