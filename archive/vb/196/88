Take a look at http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/063325.html .
The only difference is that you would set your charger for 2 amps and
use a 6 V, 12 W bulb (or a 6 V, 10 W bulb, or two 5 W bulbs in parallel).

You might take the opportunity to check the electrolyte in the battery
and top up with distilled water if needed.  This is also a wonderful
time to clean both ends of the battery cables and the battery terminals
so they shine.  If your Bus just barely misses getting started, cleaning
up the connections may be all you need to do.  More battery cable advice
is here: http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/043374.html .  (For
some reason I sound like the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor
from the latest Harry Potter movie... "For details, see my many published
works.")

Before I bought a new battery, I hit my 6 V Bus with a 12 V jump-start
a few times and nothing awful happened.  If you're going to do this,
shut off the radio, all lights, etc first.  Do the hookup from + on
the donor car to + on the Bus, - on the Bus to bare metal on the donor.
!DON'T! use the donor car's negative battery terminal.  Find a good
spot like an alternator bracket, engine lifting hook, strut bolt, etc.
Please, not on the fuel system.  This last connection WILL throw a
spark when you make it.

Go and crank the Bus.  It'll crank like crazy and when it fires the
generator light may stay on.  Unhook the jumper cables as soon as
you're sure the Bus will stay running - go in the reverse order:
donor metal (it will spark again), Bus -, Bus +, donor +.  Go drive
the Bus around, keeping the revs up, to charge the battery.

Good luck!
