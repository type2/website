While this may work a few times, I'd be awfully careful doing it too many
times. The 6 volt condenser and coil along with the oil/gen dash light lose a
lot of their life expectancy.

I started my bus a number of times by jumping from a 12V system. No problem.
Make sure all lights are out and you disconnect as quickly as possible. The
dash lights get realllly bright. Your engine should turn over and start very
quickly.
