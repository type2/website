Subject: Fulcrum plates

I pulled my tranny today and found a pair of dead fulcrum plates and a 
screwed up axle on one side. Google only led me top one source, Cip1, 
for new plates. Here's the link to the page: 
http://www2.cip1.com/SearchResults.asp?Search=fulcrum&Search1=Search

Does anybody know if these plates are worth buying and do you have 
another source if they're crap?

I have plenty of used axles, so I think I'll be OK there. I even have 
more used plates, but if I can get new ones I think that might be a good 
move.

Thanks,
John
