Subject: 72 westy parts

For anybody local on Vancouver Is, I'm cutting up a 72 Westy. Got the usual
leftover crap, but if you need it its gold to you. Free slideing side door,
has a dent in lower corner but easily fixed and its rust free as well as free.
Rear part of the poptop-the luggage rack-free. For sale the two front doors,
frt seats, good clean gas tank, the 2 jaloise windows-anybody got a drivers
side riviera style? Complete factory installed eberspacher heater w/all tin
and controls also has the hot air intake for quicker heating and the dash
timer switch. Comeing frt beam,brake booster and steering box.
Give me a shout with needs.

Chuck
