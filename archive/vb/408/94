Subject: AIRS Callout: Blown Engine in Valentine NE

Howdy,

My road trip from New York to Wyoming just hit a snag.

I seem to have sone some bottom end damage to my engine a 1600dp.

While I wait for the tow into to town to show, and while I'm
recovering from shock I thought I'd put out a desperate call for a
working 1600dp engine in Northern/Northwestern Nebraska.

Used/new whatever, I'm a long long way from home.

Please feel free to call me if you can offer ANY assistance:
518-421-6502 though my phone isn't working out here in the country.
Email is currently working.

Thanks
peace
jules
