'rebuilt' here. They say "We don't rebuild yours,we build a new one but need
your old harness for the ends". Sorry,guys..... you are rebuilding them!:
http://www.kyleautomotivespecialties.com/products   The only thing Kyle uses
off the old harness is the connector bodies, the pins and seals are new. He
builds some very impressive stuff. He did a harness for a friends daughters
split bus and it is a work of art.

You need to look up the definition of 'rebuild'. From here:
http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/rebuild





1.
to repair, esp. to dismantle and reassemble with new parts: to rebuild an old
car.

If they are wanting YOUR core to use parts OFF of it, they ARE rebuilding YOUR
harness.  No if ands or buts.  Sorry, Clinton had sex with that intern
also.....
