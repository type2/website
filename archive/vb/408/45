Subject: Anyone with a split that has IRS?

I'm putting my crew cab back together today.  I had a few minutes last night
to put the engine and trans together for today's festivities.

Anyone out there have IRS like me?  I would love to see some pics of the
rear shock layout.  Mine has some butchered brackets welded to a gusseted
bug trailing arm.  The top mount is a threaded bar welded into the frame.
Then the cones of the KYB shocks have been removed and then installed upside
down.  The shocks no longer work, but I don't want to replace them until I
research a better layout.  I would be interested to see how close the axles
come to the shocks.

I know that Old Speed uses some threaded round stock and welds it to the
frame somewhere and then uses the stock trailing arm shock mount.  My stock
shock mounts have been removed.

I have new trailing arms waiting.

I have also considered moving the torsion housing forward about 6 inches.
Anybody tackle that one?  The only buses I have seen this done to were 911
conversions.

Thanks
