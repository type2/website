Subject: RE: F-1 cable

The wiring for the fuel injection. I was told that it was F1 or F-1 cable

Thanks for the response.

It is called 'fuel injection harness'.
You can get yours 'rebuilt' here. They say "We don't rebuild yours, we build a
new one but need your old harness for the ends". Sorry, guys..... you are
rebuilding them!:
