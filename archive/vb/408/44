Subject: Just back from Sac Bug-O-Rama--Also a call in

Hey Guys.  Just got Back from another sweet
Bug-O-Rama.  I have noticed a lack of posts too.  I
have been reading the list forever now.  Usually I
don't post at all.  I thought I was doing a favor by
letting others who needed super important information
to keep their buses running have their space, and not
waste.  But I have noticed sometimes I would log on
two days in a row and not have a single digest.  So I
have to start working on my VW's and send updates to
do my part in keeping the list alive.  It used to be
we always had newcomers or someone doing some test
with their bust or just available parts questions. 
People always wrote about their progress.  Now we are
so jaded, we check for anything that pertains, and
meander on.  So for my part I finally got my brother
to go to this years show.  I bugged him for 5 years,
and he finally went.  I talked him into taking his two
sons, my nephews.  Maybe next year I can get his
daughter and wife.  My chick is a trooper, and one
year carried a decklid for me while I carried four
fenders from the back of the swaps all the way to the
parking lot.  I know she's awsome huh.  It was great
hearing my nephews yell at the drag cars going by, and
asking why my bug wasn't racing.  I need a fiberglass
front end as I have extensive damage from a hit and
run in front my house.  They are so young they think
its easy to fix it cause they watched Herbie Fully
Loaded.  Hard to explain to them why I
can't--economics,time,parts, and so forth.  Great show
I recommend it to everyone.  I'll try to add some to
the list and keep it alive.
