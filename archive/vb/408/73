Subject: Re: [VB] Front door handles, Interior.

the mid 64+ ;ater inside front door handles have a screw to attach them.??
 If you swap out your pin handles for the later?kind they will look tidier than if you drill a hole in yours.
Same spline, so they fit on there.

My interior front door handles are of the pinned on variety. To remove you must push back the flange behind the handle to make room for a pin punch to hammer out the pin.?
That darn pin is just a pita to get out and replace.?
?
Have any of you folks out there converted the handles to be held on with a screw??
