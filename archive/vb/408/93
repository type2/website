If your Volkswagen is properly broken in, so that it can enjoy a long,  
trouble-free life, it is important to have the first maintenance  
services and lubrications performed at 300, 1,500 and 3,000 miles.  
Under adverse driving conditions do not forget to have your Volkswagen  
lubricated once between the regular lubrications and maintenance

etc. Have the oil level checked, the front end lubricated and the door
