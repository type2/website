Maybe you are hearing the relatively low beat frequency between two
higher-frequency vibrations?  If one piece is vibrating at 80 Hz and
another is vibrating at 100 Hz, you'll get 20 Hz (difference), 80 Hz,
100 Hz, 180 Hz (sum), and probably more.  A live spectrum analyzer or
FFT analysis of a recording may help.

Rent a crane and go to the next car audio contest in your town.  "Pardon
me, but can I hang my Bus over your car for a while?  I need to do
SCIENCE!"  :)

You might be able to do it with software in the middle - in other words,
run the mic into a PC, run one of the analog-synth-emulator programs
on the PC, and hook the PC's line out into an amp and your bass speaker.
The A/D-compute-D/A time will set some minimum phase delay, but you
should be able to lengthen this as much as you want.  I know a whole PC
is overkill for this, but they are easily available and you don't have
to remember which end of the soldering iron to pick up.
