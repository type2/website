Rennie Asked:
 Is that visco foam closed-cell?  It's not going to hold moisture?




Its open celled foam. It should hold plenty of moisture.
I think the trick here is that its the visco-elastic variety. Kinda like the 
memory foam mattresses. Its a good sound absorber. I know that there is 
engineered foam especially for sound absorbtion but this seems to work quite 
well. Noticed it by accident when we got a sample from our carpent 
installer.
The foam has a skinned side. That goes against the panel leaving the open 
side facing the interior. The decorative covering must be something that 
passes sound such as cloth. Vinyl will reflect sound.
