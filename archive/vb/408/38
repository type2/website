I'm still here!

I joined in '99 to ask for help when my bus was stolen.  Within about
an hour my request had been propagated to other VW lists and I had an
inbox full of people offering help, advice and moral support.  Even
had a couple members put pictures and a description of my bus on their
personal sites (thanks Stephen and Dan, wherever you guys are!).

I figure as long as there is a VB list I'll be on it :)
