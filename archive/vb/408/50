Ok...
Purchased the 1/2" thick visco-elastic rebond carpet padding and installed 
onto:
Front door panels with just the mounting screws.
Front kick panels with just the mounting screws.
Both sides (front and back) of the partition behind the seats, used 3M spray 
mount here. Did not do the spare tire well.
None on the ceiling panels.

Results:
Freeway speeds did not exceed 95dbC or 79dbA
The perceived noise was definitely lower.
The exhaust drone was pretty bad at a steady 65 or any other steady speed 
where the engine was not loaded, quiets down on acceleration.
Interestingly the exhaust drone does not seem to show up on the meter.
Coasting at 70 dropped the noise 3-5dbC. Didn't have time to check dbA.
Radio was a  bit easier to hear at a non ear splitting level.

Next step is to obtain a nice decorative upholstry fabric and cover the 
uglies. I'll then use some nice 3M spray mounting cement to glue the foam 
and fabric to the panels.  Its time to give up on the stock hardboard look 
and go to an upscale custom panel look.
I may also do some stuff such as cover the under side of the parcel tray. 
May add some more Dynomat here and there.

Anyone want photos, pmail me.
