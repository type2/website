Subject: Bus sighting in CT (Maybe a barn find?)

Hi All - I used to always appreciate when people would do this for  
me, so I figured I'd re-subscribe to the list to share this one.

    I have no affiliation with anyone related to this bus, but on the  
way home from work yesterday, I spotted a splittie in a farmyard on a  
back road in Hamden CT.  This farm and 65 acres is actually for sale,  
and there are always old farm implements for sale in the front yard  
that look like they have been dragged out of the fields or barns.   
The bus appeared on Tuesday, is blue and white, 13 window (I think),  
with the old style 70's or  80's, CT license plate on the front.    I  
don't know if it is for sale, or maybe a visiting relative, or  
anything else about it, and again have no affiliation with this bus,  
I've only seen it in passing for two days now, from about 30 yards  
away.  It just smells to me of a possible diamond in the rough.   
Could also be a piece of crap, I have no idea.

   I am a recovering bus addict, and have thinned my herd down to  
one, so I will be taking a different route home the next few days.   
The bus is on Gaylord Mountain Road, in Hamden, CT, about 30 seconds  
past Broken Arrow Nursery, going north,  on the right.  You can't  
miss it if you make it that far.

   Good luck
