Subject: Hawaiian vacation, anyone have a bus we could rent/borrow?

So, the kid learned all about Hawaii in her kindergarten class a few weeks
ago, and has asked if she could go there for her birthday.  The wife and I
looked at each other with a silly look on our faces and said, uh, hmm, sure,
why not!?  We have been meaning to get over there and check it out anyway,
what better excuse could there be than the kid asking to go?
 
As we were in throws of figuring it out for a February '09 trip, I was
wondering if there is anyone on the big island with a bus.  Perhaps, someone
with a nice 21/23 window that we could rent/borrow and cruise around in?
Or, perhaps someone that wanted to drive us around and show us the sites (of
course a fee included for gas/time/labor).  We would love to share a day, or
even a few hours with a fellow bus lover.  pMail me if you would like to
chat about potential details.
 
I have not really seen anyone asking for a rental/borrow when they traveled
before, so I thought I would spam... er... uh... share with you all the
story and the request to see if perhaps anyone has thought of or experienced
renting/borrowing a bus while traveling.  Anyone?
