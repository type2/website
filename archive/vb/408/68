I guess I didn't quite describe accurately where the screw would go.
I would drill axially into the splined door handle spud. The pin is 
currently installed radially thru the handle to engage with a groove on the 
spud.

Imagine facing the door from inside. You would see the head of the screw 
facing you. It would not be used to replace the pin which installs from the 
side of the handle. The screw would draw the handle down tight onto the 
spud.
