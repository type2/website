Subject: Trailer tires speeds  and wear ..just FYI 

http://rvnews.rvsales.com/2008/05/rv-tire-safety.html

This talks about trailer tires and this is hard to believe quotes...

"ST tires have a maximum speed rating of 65 MPH. Drive faster than that 
and risk tire failure."

 "trailer tires are designed to last 3-5 years or 5,000-12,000 miles and 
are not designed to wear out"

And we thought you had to wear the tires :)
