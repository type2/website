While it's renting Vanagon Westies, not splitties, check out
http://www.imua-tour.com/
they are on the Big Island I believe, and have links to rental places on the
other islands. I'm pretty sure the owner was on the type2 list a while back,
and he and I emailed back and forth when I went out there in 2001, but
unfortunately he was all booked up at the time. I saw several vanagons and a
few bays, not bo splits when I was out there...awesome place to visit
though.
