Hi,

One of you guys out there must know more than pork and beans about exhaust 
systems. Can an exhaust system be tuned to damp out the noise from a certain 
rpm range better than another?  I would be looking for better quieting 
performance from 3200-3900 rpm.

I currently have a stock system with the ole pea shooter exhaust on a 1776 
engine. Drones like a mad cow at above rpms's.

Chris
