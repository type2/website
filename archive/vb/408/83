Subject: Re: [VB] MPG

Back in the 80's I basically lived in a 65 bus for almost a year it was 
an original standard. I built a bit of a camper my way. It had a 1500 
sp Everything stock, ignition, muffler etc. I kept track of all the gas 
I put in it over the entire time. I got 22 mpg.  I visited many states 
and it was one of the most memorable times of my life. I drove dirt 
roads and always rather slowly. I drove as fast as 60 mph on the HWY.
I had vw's on and off and currently own a 67 1500 sp  with a 009 
distributer and stock muffler and the replacement carb (h30/31 I 
think). I would say that again I keep track of all the gas and miles 
and I get about 19 MPG and that is really around town. I am afraid of 
the HWY besides 65 is redline and the speed limit is 70.

My first bus was a 68 I bought with no engine when I was 18 in 1978. I 
built an engine from the parts in the VW shop I worked at. I should say 
rebuilt because the usual rebuild parts were new.It was a 1600 sp with 
a stock bug muffler then later an extracter exhaust and stock ignition. 
I was not as good at keeping track of mpg but with an empty bus going 
back and forth on the jersey turnpike I got 30 mpg.... hey I know it 
does not make sense. I always drove 60 mph.
I cant tell you about the bugs I had-I cant remember plus I shared them 
with other people, girl friends, college buddies and other riff raff.
