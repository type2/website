Hi Chris,

If we are talking about adding plywood to the bus, I can say from experience
that a couple of years ago I had a chance to pick up about a 74 Westy that
was genuinely rarely used for camping only. As such, it was quite intact as
far as the interior having all the panels and camping cabinents, floor
coverings, etc. The seals were also good. With all of this, I can say that
it was quite a quiet ride. I can also say that with all the weight from all
that plywood, that it was quite a heavy ride, so the engine wasn't as zippy
as normal, but not bad at all. The weight also made the ride feel very
smooth.

What's a good way to add mass or stiffness to a panel? I have quite a bit
more Dynamat Extreme. Only problem with that is that you only get to stick
it on once. Almost impossible to remove.

How about on both sides of the partition panels, adding more Dynamat, add a
layer of the rebond padding and then a layer of 1/4" plywood. All bonded
using contact cement. Dynamat to damp the sheet metal some more, the padding
as a decoupling layer and the plywood as a containment. Problem is that this
is only an experiment with no basis in actual design or analysis. In other
words, just a wild ass guess.

The key to a quiet bus is going to be damping out these panels. If we can
figure that out, we can all drive down the highway in relative quiet.
