Subject: Re: VintageBus roll call

My oldest post I found was Aug 2001, but I think I had some much older  
than that. Time flies and I haven't gotten much further on my bus  
since then. Though since then I do have a new swing lever, new shift  
rod assembly/bushings and am in the middle of redoing the trans  
mounts. Hopefully I can drive it while I can still afford a gallon of  
gas. Though I admit I was pricing how much it would cost to convert it  
to electric power.

It's interesting to me how online activity evolves. I recently deleted  
VintageBus mail older than 2 years old. But I ran across a mail I had  
to sent to a fellow bus'er in 2005 and his response was that he was  
afraid to get overwhelmed with mail being on the list. :-)

Community sites continue to grow, individual sites continue to  
dwindle. More people put their thoughts now on blogs and community  
forums, their pictures on photo-sharing sites. I haven't done much to  
my own site in years but instead regularly work on our aircoolers.org  
site.

Interestingly the Texas Coalition of Buses mail list is still very  
active. (TCB is having their Krause Springs campout this weekend.)
