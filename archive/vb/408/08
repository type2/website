I'm a lurker also. 8^)  Usually I can't offer as much as most people who
post here and know a lot more than I do.

I prefer VB over TheSamba.  Our web use is monitored at work, so no
Samba, but reading emails from VB is not problem.

Still, I miss the long trip reports (Charlie Ford, NoQuarter, etc...)
