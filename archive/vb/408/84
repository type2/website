Hi Frank,
	Fuel economy in old type 2s is variable.  I know first hand that a  
solid stock 1500 sp in a '66 will average 24-26 mpg at 60 mph.  My  
'67 1600 sp, totally balanced with counter weighted balanced crank,   
Berg heads, rarely gets 24 mpg.   Maybe Clyde cut too much out of the  
heads?
	For the best fuel economy I think that total balancing is critical.   
Also, run the CR around 7.4-7.6 to 1, use 91 octane fuel and time the  
ignition as far advanced as makes sense for your elevation above sea  
level and the fuel you buy.  Crappy engine cases seem to really lower  
your fuel economy!  Gary Gibson
