Subject: Roll Call

To All,
 
I'm still here reading away.  
 
Did some major work to my crew cab.  New trans.  Independent rear  end out of 
a super beetle with gearing for the mountains up here (thanks to  Ronnie).  
It lowered the back about an 1" so I had to have drop spindles  made to lower 
the front also (thanks to Ronnie again).  Then, I always  hated the color.  
Prior owner had painted it "baby sh*t yellow" on the  lower panels.  I forget the 
VW color name, but it was horrible.   I had the bottom painted velvet green 
which was an original color for the year  and left the vee and the top white.  
It looks and rides great now.
 
Kombi is still the same and just keeps chuggin' along.
 
We have an exotic car show here this weekend and I use them to service the  
food and booze concessions.  They get more attention than the Ferrari's and  
Lamborghini's.  
 
Thanks for sending the "roll call".  It is good to see all of us (or  most) 
still here.  Keep smiling.
