Subject: Front door handles, Interior.

My interior front door handles are of the pinned on variety. To remove you 
must push back the flange behind the handle to make room for a pin punch to 
hammer out the pin.
That darn pin is just a pita to get out and replace.

Have any of you folks out there converted the handles to be held on with a 
screw?

Thought I would remove the hardware from the door, chuck the splined spud up 
in a lathe, drill and tap a 8-32 or 10-32 hole. Then drill a clearance hole 
thru the center of the handle. Then I can use a decorative screw to hold the 
handle on.

Any thoughts? Good idea? Bad idea?
Anyone else ever had problems removing or installing front door handles?

BTW, my bus is a 64 DD delivery. Maybe the deluxe buses or different years 
used different handles? Maybe I just need to get the interior hardware from 
a later or different bus?

I'm continuing my quest for a quieter bus. Looked around for rattling panels 
this weekend and found several. Added brackets, screws and stop rubbers to 
eliminate successfully. Slowly getting closer to the main noise sources.

Cheers,
Chris
