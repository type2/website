It's Friday! so pardon the offtopicalness.

This is a blatant plug, but it might be useful for
anyone looking for hard-to-find vintage luggage.

If you want a nice set for your bus, there is a shop
in Berkeley, CA that has a wall full of vintage sets
and individual pieces.

It's called Scavangerie and is located at 1722 San
Pablo Ave. Craig doesn't have a website, so you'll
have to go in there to see what he has. He is open
from 11-5 Wednesday through Sunday. 510-318-1626 or
408-439-3838 or scavangerie(-at-)hotmail.com

Google Scavangerie and you can find a few photos
customers have posted of the shop.

If you are a guitar person, he has about 60 in there
plus accordions and other vintage instruments as well.

Tell him cuzin Jeff sent you!
