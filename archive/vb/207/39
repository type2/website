Sorry for the cornfusion. The mod wasn't to mount the stereo - its to shave
the factory knock off panel to get that seemless straight finned look all
the way across. It really looks sharp. Im really not worried about a next
owner, never gonna sell'er. Aparently not even for a stupid amazing deal on
a 98 Carrera4s!

Cheers,

JT

My thought would be don't do it.  It's just as easy to make/buy a bracket to
mount the radio under the dash or parcel tray.  This bus may never be on the
show circuit again; but if you ever have to sell the bus, then a modified
dash probably won't be very appealing to the next owner.
