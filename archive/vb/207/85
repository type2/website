OK I missed.
Front Mounts are 025 not 114 (6 pop outs). duh.
But as far as becoming standard.

A quick search on thoms database and 025 and 425 as well as the mysterious
426 show up in plenty of the 65-67 busses but not all.
025 also shows up with 425, 426 and 460 at times which are apparently all
3 us packages of some sort.
425 supposedly having to do with belts and mounts.
