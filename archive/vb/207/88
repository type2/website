going price from anywhere in the states... lax, seatac, pdx, dc, nyc, etc
etc to amsterdam, frankfurt, berlin, etc. etc. is 1100-1400... that's prime
time for travel remember.  However, if you're a bucs gambler you may want to
wait to the last minute and scoop up on some of those 'blow out price/fill
the plane up' tickets.

I've got a freebie ticket and will use it with a 'companion' ticket to get
me, the wife, and the 7 year old over there... or at least thats Plan 'A'.
