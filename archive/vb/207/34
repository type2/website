I would like to know what oil filter was used in this full-flow.

From the diagrams in Tom Wilsons book it appears that all oil doesn't go
through the filter all the time, in reality oil that is bypassed just
goes back to the sump if there is sufficient volume and pressure to
activate the bypass plungers.
Does that sound right?
