Colleagues,

I hope you all got a chance to open up the site mentioned in Ted Smith's
message regarding my query about retro seat belts.

I had a chance to not only see but ride in Rob's beauty.  Sweet it is.  A real
Cherry.  Probably the best resto I will ever have the privelege of riding in
and seeing up close.

Unfortunately I didn't get a close up of the middle seat, it may not have even
been installed.  Don't remember what Rob did but I do remember that my Luvly
did sit in the rear seat (at her insistence) and that she used the seatbelt.

If you can believe it, some knee-jerk conservative reactionary legislator in
the Utah Legislature wants to repeal Utah's mandatory seat belt law.

Best,

Curt
