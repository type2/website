Hi Kevin,
Pretty sure the bug fuse box will not work both due to being the wrong size 
and wired clipwise the wrong way.  Definitely it will not mount properly in a 
bus.

Apply a bit of flux to one edge of the clips and apply the hot soldering iron 
to the opposite edge.  When the heat works it way across enough to melt the 
flux paste and capilary action will suck in the flux between the individual 
brass clips used in post-1960 fuse boxes.  For some reason this also works 
well for solder not only due to capilary action, but that solder tends to 
follow the heat that melts it!

Absolutely!
