Excellent question!  Brings back Muirs, front is front lecture.  If you
are looking at VW Wiring Manuals, some "officially" show the ignition hot
wire on the page right (67' USA) and some show the ignition hot wire on
page left (61' USA)  On top of that, some show the hot wire going into
page top (61' USA, 67' USA); but it really goes into the bottom, as the
page presents everything else relatively. That makes it difficult for
someone who has never seen the original configuration, and trying to
figure it out from the diagrams.

Best,

61' you know
