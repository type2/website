Subject: Re: [VB] Contact Cement vs. Weatherstip Adhesive

Sure, I'll take this one!

Weatherstrip adhesive is that yellow goopy stuff. It stays fairly
flexible, and takes about a full day to set up and strengthen, but seems
to age well.

Contact cement sets up and tacks in minutes (follow instructions on
container for best results), and also seems to remain somewhat flexible as
well, but doesn't seem to weather well. It's great for inside use, and
when you can't hold something in place for a day.

Neither sticks well to many plastics, but they melt them well. From my
experience with both, neither does what I need most - stick nylon velcro
strips to the body of my bus. Both work great on any porous material. Both
stick well to clean, degreased steel.
