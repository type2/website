Harry,

If the bus travels around the record at a constant rate or speed, the
inner groove diameters are far shorter than the outer ones. The record is
meant to spin at a constant angular speed, which means that the outer
grooves are passing under the stylus at a way faster speed than the inner
ones are.

So if the toy bus is tracking the grooves at a constant rate, the recorded
music on the inner grooves, being more compressed physically, and 'in
time', will be played faster; ie, the pitch and tempo of the music goes
up.
