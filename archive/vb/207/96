Thanks!  I checked in Google and found the fonts you mentioned on sites
like http://www.identifont.com .  I also found that some of the font sites
have a step-by-step "identify a font" feature that asks you questions about
the appearance of various letters in the font and narrows down the field of
candidates.  Identifont didn't have any better matches than Gill Sans, and
one I tried at Adobe kept leading me to fonts that were designed after the
Bentleys were printed.  I finally ran across what I think are the exact
fonts at Linotype.  The body font looks like "Metromedium #2" (1936) and
the headings look like "Memphis Bold" (1929).  Both fonts (links below) are
trademarked by Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG, which seems reasonable for a
book that was probably originally printed in Germany.

If these don't work, go to http://www.fontexplorer.com/FontStore/ , click
on the "Font Store" tab, and search for the names.

Thanks for your help!  Because of this, I now know there were ways to
identify fonts other than by flipping through sample books that I don't
have.
