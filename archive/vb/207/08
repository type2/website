Subject: fuse box

one other question....why are the fuses numbered from right to left?
------------------------ Clip ------------------------
I'm sitting here and getting very confused.
Why or is there an issue on this matter.
The clear covers are numbered and the fuses are easy to locate and test.
If I have a fuse failure most times I just give it a spin in its spring
holders and the oxidation wipes off the lead link and it goes back to
operating properly.
My Vanagon has an Add On two fuse extension for the Blower Motor. I've
seen as many as three extension boxes added to Vanagons and that gets
confusing. Add Ons are used for A/C, Blower Motors, Cruise Control,
Driving Lights, Dual Horns. Often they lead to a relay that is floating
behind the dash wrapped in electrical tape .......... then you got a real
mystery.
And as Clouse Audi would say "It's a German thing; you wouldn't
understand".
