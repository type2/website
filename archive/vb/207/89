Ooh Ooh! I know.

The record turns at a constant angular velocity, so the further you are
from the pivot the faster the record surface moves under the needle.  The
record is recorded to compensate for this.  Vinyl Killer moves at a
constant speed so the music seems to speed up as it approaches the center
of the record.
