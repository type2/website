Subject: Re: [VB] question on RPM

I've been wondering about this for years - I run my setup on the highway
at about 3400RPM, doing about 63 mph.  Question is, is that ideal for the
engine?  My engine assembler told me to only go up to 4000 for short
times, ie passing/shifting up, so I keep it around 3300 to 3500 on the
road.

I think your engine builder is dead right.
Most early models have engine modifications that change the rules a bit
and many owners prefer the performance over longevity. They know the
rules and accept the consequences of shorter engine life.
Most of my experience is with pure stock type IV Air cooled and I've
gotten excellent long term sevice by following your engine builders
rules, in the range of 150K out of my engines.
I very seldom see the need to exceed 4000 rpms, I run about 3300 rpms at
70 mph on an 83 Westy.
