It has a bay front beam! 

Why would it speed up near the center? Does your turntable slow down near the 
end of the record?

 -Harry in Fresno   - See you at OCTO!


 But how does it stay in the groove? The curvature decreases as you in
 towards the center. Does it follow the curvature? How?
 
 These are important questions!
