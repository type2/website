Subject: 60 Single cab swap for a FIAT 124 ??!!

I've decided to part with my 1960 Single cab and I'm looking for a nice
rust free FIAT 124 Spider ?? and would consider a part-exchange if
anyones interested.

Price is #5250 and pictures at:   http://146.87.115.85/pickup/

the pictures named CNV... are the best
