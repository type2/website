Subject: Re: [VB] question on RPM

from the original VW manuals I've read the top recommended cruising speed for 
the type 1 ACVW was 3500 rpms.   Okay to go faster for a short time, but just 
for a short time.  

The best cooling is at about 2600 to 2800 rpms.  This seems to hold true for 
a variety of engine sizes from stock to 2000cc uprights, SP and DP.   So 
depending on the weather you might want to adjust your speed, ie keep it to 
3K in summer if the engine seems to be getting hot.

I haven't messed with the machines that read torque hp etc, but my 65 westy 
w/1600 and FF doesn't like to pull steep hills below about 2800 rpms.     The 
advice of dropping to 2500 for better cooling doesn't work in this case, as 
the bus can't pull hills at that rpm.  So it just gets hot going up hills in 
summer

If you are happy with  your hill climbing ability and have some extra power, 
I'd go for larger tires.   I have 195 75 14 LTs.   Word is if you keep your 
cruising speed to 3K it greatly increases engine life over driving 3500rpms, 
even though VW said 3500rpms was fine.

 I've been wondering about this for years - I run my setup on the highway
 at about 3400RPM, doing about 63 mph.  Question is, is that ideal for the
 engine?  My engine assembler told me to only go up to 4000 for short
 times, ie passing/shifting up, so I keep it around 3300 to 3500 on the road.
 
 I'm running a DP engine with 90.2mm cylinders into a Freeway Flyer, to
 185R14 tires (tread's getting low), 67 deluxe.
 
 Anybody else's thoughts would be welcome on this pressing issue.
