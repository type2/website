Subject: BBB VII high res pics needed

  Hot VW's is going to do an article on BBB, they were there but would like
to get some more pics. I need some high resolution digi or prints of BBB VII
to send to them. They cannot use pics off the net due to the low resolution.
Any help would be appreciated.

ronnie  London Bridge Bullis (a NEATO chapter)

ps. The London Bridge Bullis (BBB VII) are donating $7000 dollars from the
event to 2 local children's charities, thanks to all that came.

the registered count was

106 split buses, up from 85 in 2002
45 bay windows, down from 52 in 2002
21 vanagons
3 Eurovans
and at least another 50 buses that did not register
