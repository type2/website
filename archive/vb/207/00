I've been wondering about this for years - I run my setup on the highway
at about 3400RPM, doing about 63 mph.  Question is, is that ideal for the
engine?  My engine assembler told me to only go up to 4000 for short
times, ie passing/shifting up, so I keep it around 3300 to 3500 on the road.

I'm running a DP engine with 90.2mm cylinders into a Freeway Flyer, to
185R14 tires (tread's getting low), 67 deluxe.

Anybody else's thoughts would be welcome on this pressing issue.
