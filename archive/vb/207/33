Send the photos to Rimco and see if they still think the case is good.
They OK'd it with all that casting slag ?!
Maybe you could sell it to GEX ! Dave \X/

It is hard to believe that so much could be wrong with a block but the
bearings show symptoms of processing trash. That might be the least of
the problems from what I see on the photos.
Some folks in my local VW club run the aluminum blocks and got good
product and are getting good service ..../ possibly another manufacturer?
I'd be interested in knowing at what rpm the knock appears first and did
it come and go or just get worse?
