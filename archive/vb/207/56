Wow Matt, what do you do for a living? Excellent data here, thanks very
much. I was expecting a discouraging journey on this one, but I was hoping
someone had had some luck with this before. The speakers in question really
do provide enormous bang for the buck compared with car audio components. I
agree that the splitty is pretty much all about the basics, one of the
things I love so much about it. Gotta love a fully manual vehicle for pure
driving pleasure - no Expedition for me, ever. However, I have always wanted
some tunes for her. Been putting it off 11 years now, so I guess it can
wait. Who knows, in 11 more years, I can probably sport a satellite based
system in it that receives its power from space, takes up no room, and only
costs $1. Although, from your figures below, if I play the system at half
volume, my power requirements are cut in half(ish) right? I've never played
these beyond highnoon as they are damn loud at that setting. 2 sets running
simultaneously at half power should have the power requirement of 1 set at
full I presume. You're right tho, working headlights and ignition coil would
be nice too...

Thanks again for the feedback. I know it's a stereotype (and those are bad)
but if any of you bus drivin' hippies still listen to the good'ol Grateful
Dead, check out the stash at :  http://db.etree.org/jtjames and I'll shoot
ya some tunes. Hope to have this all up on FTP soon.

Take care,

JT

>Logitech 5.1.  These are ~500W true RMS A/C speakers

Per Klipsch's site, their amp is 60 W/ch x 5 + 170 W/ch x 1 (470 W
total) continuous.  That's pretty close to the 500 W "maximum burst
power", but some manufacturers play a little looser with the specs.
Logitech claims 505 W RMS total, but they don't give the THD specs
or frequency ranges like Klipsch does.  They are _probably_ based
on the same "FTC" testing standards as Klipsch as Logitech probably
doesn't want to get sued.

Neither Klipsch nor Logitech specifies the line power or current in
the docs I've seen on their sites.  The laws of thermodynamics tell us
that if you're pumping 470 W out of the amp, you have to put at least
470 W in.  Depending on the amp design, you might have to put as much
as 100% more in, but most modern amps do better.  The eight-year-old
Pioneer tuner I have in my living room says 390 W in buys you 240 W
out, a 62.5% increase.  Based on this, you'd need somewhere between
470 W and 760 W to run the Klipsch speakers, and 505 W and 820 W to
run the Logitech speakers at full volume.

Your listening habits will determine how often you run the speakers
at full volume, but assuming that they will always be at full volume
results in a conservative design.  You can scale this down, depending
on how much you usually crank your music and your tolerance for using
jumper cables.  :)  If you install two systems, multiply everything
by two...

You'll need an inverter to step up the 12 V DC in your Bus to 120 V AC
for the speakers.  (If your bus is still 6 V, well, "you can hear the
music on the AM radio (AM radio AM radio))".)  A nice inverter like
a Tripp-Lite PV1000FC will take 100 A (-at-) 12 V DC (1200 W) and produce
8.33 A (-at-) 120 V AC (1000 W) continuously.  Assuming it scales linearly,
to get 470 W - 820 W out for your speakers, it will take around 570
W to 990 W (-at-) 12 V in.  A quick Google reveals pricing from $200 to
$250 or so.

Now you'll need to put some juice into the inverter.  There will be
a battery involved, but let's conservatively assume that you want
all your juice to come from the generator.  This is pretty close to
what happens with the stock system -- the battery is mostly there
for starting and to supply current when the generator RPM is too low
for charging.  When the revs come up, the generator can supply the
load plus recharge the battery.

Splitties with the 12 V option had a 450 W generator.  Later 12 V
alternators (early 70s) were rated at 700 W.  I seem to recall seing a
really high-output alternator, something like 900 or 1000 W, in one of
the VW rags.  Remember, if you are only going to have one alternator
or generator, you'll need enough juice to power your stereo and
have enough left over for such trivial things as the ignition coil,
headlights, and such.   A 1000 W alternator would give you 430 W
(best case) to 10 W (worst case) to run the rest of your Bus with.
A 12 V split with the headlights on low beam needs about 105 W for
the lights, so 10 W isn't gonna make it.

All this is to say, you'll probably need a second alternator.
Bosch sold kits to do this back in the day, and you might also be able
to adapt an A/C compressor mounting bracket to hold an alternator.
If you get into making a bracket, you don't necessarily have to use a
VW-style alternator.  Generic Motors internal-regulator alternators
are cheap, easy to hook up, and readily available in various sizes.
One catalog speed shop sells a 100 A (1200 W) for $120.

Just as an aside, alternators are around 65% efficient at converting
spin into juice.  So, to get that 570 W to 990 W of juice, you'll
need around 850 W to 1500 W of spin.  That may seem like a weird way
to express spin until you remember that 745.7 W is 1 hp, meaning you
need around 1.1 hp to 2 hp to run the stereo at full volume.

Now for the battery.  You'll need at least a small battery to help
smooth the pulsating DC coming from the alternator.  If you want to
listen for a long time while parked, you'll need a larger battery.
As a starting point, the stock 12 V battery was rated 12 V, 45 Ah /
20 hr.  This means that you can draw 2.25 amps continously from the
battery for 20 hours before it is dead.  It doesn't scale linearly;
you can't draw 22.5 amps for 2 hours or 225 amps for 12 minutes.
Data for a somewhat similar 12 V 46 Ah / 10 hr battery show that you
can draw 18.8 A for 2 hours or 133 A for 12 minutes.  Since you need
somewhere between (570/12) = 47.5 A and (990/12) = 82.5 A, you could
get runtimes of around 45 to 25 minutes.  This battery might cost
you $50.  Interstate has a Group 27 marine battery (something like
Stephen mentioned) that is rated about 102 Ah / 20 hr, 75 Ah / 3 hr.
Your runtime would be in the range of 90 to 45 minutes.  This battery
will cost you around $100 to $150 or so.

So, you'll spend maybe $350 for the speakers, $200 to $250 for the
inverter, $120 plus brackets and fangling for the alternator, $50
to $150 for the battery, and maybe $50 for cables, wire, brackets,
and such.  Your total bill is then $720 to $870 or so; around $1.85
to $1.43 a watt of audio.

One alternative would be to go with a car stereo amplifier that is
already designed to run on 12 V.  This would save the cost of the
inverter, but the 500 W output power is still a pretty tall order and
might still put you in second-alternator land.  A quick check around
says you could easily spend $550 on 500 W worth of 12 V amplifiers, and
then you still have to buy speakers.  If you dropped your requirement
to 250 W with a 12 V car amp, a single late-model alternator and
possibly a slightly beefier battery might be all you need.

Here's my own personal opinion.  The hole in the dash is for an AM
or AM/FM radio.  So find one that fits, and stick it in there.  Or,
mount a newer radio on the parcel shelf under the radio hole.  A Bus,
to me, isn't the right place to me to put a 500 W stereo system.
Buses are about straight 30 weight oil and valve adjustments and
60 MPH top speed and shifting gears and being able to take half
the car apart with a double-ended screwdriver and a 13 mm wrench.
They're about an engine that was designed in 1939 and a body that was
designed in 1949.  They're not about air conditioning, fuel injection,
air bags, OBD-II compliance, or half-kilowatt sound systems that play
tapes, CDs, MP3s, and satellite radio.  If you want an Excursion,
you know where to find one.  That's what I think.
