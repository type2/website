Subject: Re: [VB] Severe Hesitation

check fuel filter.  DO you think crust is coming loose in teh tank.  have you 
ever checked the sock in the tank?

clean carb out

does this happen only the first ten minutes you drive?   then it might be 
carb icing-  hook up pre heat.  you still get carb icing with pre heat, but 
it goes away after the engines on a couple minutes.

Check to make sure the reserve tap is in the correct position.  I once left 
the tap off after pulling the motor for some reason, and it didn't go 
completely off, but dripped, so it was okay for idle, and driving 
slowly/start stop, but when I got on the freeway it gas starved out.  Oh, 
duh, push the dumb knob in.

Could be timing, but if it's in the right place and it advances that seems 
unlikely.

fuel pump issue?

 Carb rebuilt (28pci), new points, condenser.  It hase been timed correctly , 
 and the points and valves adjusted.  I'm thinking of trying a larger main 
 jet.  The one in there now is the original 117.5.  It appears that there is 
 not sufficient fuel delivery when the velocity of the air through the carb 
is 
 reduced.  (reduced vacuum)  For example, it starts fine, idles perfect, and 
 starts off great.  I can climb any hill in first gear, shift to higher gear 
 and the hesitation begins.  Could it still be a timing issue??  I have 
 checked it both statically and with a strobe.  My dizzy is advancing.  Do 
you 
 think a larger main, maybe a 122 would help or should i start experimenting 
 with different jets.
