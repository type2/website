the first three digits of the chassis number give you the info. 
  The 2 is for type 2 (transporter) 
the 2nd digit, 3, is the model, yours is a kombi, rather than a panel van, 
standard microbus, pickup,etc
the 3rd digit is the last digit of the model year, yours is 7, so it's a 67.
hm, but normally there is a 9 digit chassis number from 65 on, is there 
another number stamped in that you misssed in the dirt?

Congrats on the bus!!!

The Bentley book for the 63-67 transporter is the best book, with info on the 
body and details on every piece of the bus.   Who else will tell how to 
change the glass in the front door?

 That with an idiot guide for the learning mechanic and tips and 
entertainment will sort you out.  If you have a later (1600, or doghouse etc.) motor, you 
may want a later Bentley that matches the motor,  which often (sometimes) are 
available at used book stores.

Do you have pictures?
