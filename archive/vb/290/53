John, Eric&Barb;

The former owner of my '64 splittie disabled the stock heater & plugged the
fan ports. Besides putting dual carbs on it,it sucks gas like water! I'm not
so convinced that it hasn't actually done damage (he also removed the
thermostat).

Hi John,
Keep the stock heating system.  Doing without will require using lots more
gas and thusly worse MPG.  ...
