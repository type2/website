Subject: kick panel restoration

Hi,
I just got hold of a warped but workable rear seat
kick panel.
Anyone know of a type of place who can fix the
aluminum? A body shop? Metal shop? Resto shop? (I'm in
los angeles)
Also, there was someone selling the aluminum rivets on
thesamba a while back but a search turned up nothing.
Anyone know who that was?

And does anyone make that piping which goes around the
edge? Platinum.(I guess it's along the top edge of the
rear wall panels too?)
Thanks,
Jason
