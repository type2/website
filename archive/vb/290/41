Subject: crankshaft gear has no timing marks

I've got a 1600 sp case all cleaned up, line bored and I'm building it with
a reconditioned crankshaft and a new cam. I ran into a show stopper until
Monday unless I can find a solution before that.

Does the crankshaft gear fit backwards onto the crankshaft? I may have put
it on backwards. I can't see the two timing marks that are needed to line up
the cam gear. Are there some crankshaft gears without timing marks? What a
surprise. I thought I could get the case built up but I'm stuck without
knowing how to set the valve timing. Doesn't it need to be precise?

Then I put in the cam just to check the mesh. As described in one of my
references, I turned the crankshaft backwards to see if the cam would pop
out of the cam bearings. It did pop right out every time I did it. So I
assume that means that the match is wrong. So I guess I need to take the cam
back where I got it and get another one.

Any advise would be appreciated. I'm in over my head here. What would you
all recommend?

Dave
