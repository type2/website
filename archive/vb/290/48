Subject: Doghouse tin.

 Hi,

Soon to get my bus back!! Been a whole year at the body shop. The engine is
almost done, but I don't know exactly what sheet metal pieces are needed for
the doghouse cooler. Where can I find an exploded view of the doghouse
engine tin? I want to be sure that all the pieces are there.

I know about the Hoover bit. I have the fan housing and the piece that goes
over the tranee bell with the hole. What goes in between? There is also a
big hole at the bottom of the air inlet side of the cooler. Should there not
be a piece of tin to cover that?

Thanks,
Chris
