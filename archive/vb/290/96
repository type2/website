The engine won't overheat, but the aluminum finned heat sinks bonded to the
steel exhaust pipe inside the heaterbox can get too hot and 'overheat',
resulting them cracking and coming loose. It's something I've seen a few
times. The heaterbox still works, but is no longer as efficient. The cheap
aftermarket heaterboxes that do not have the aluminum fins on the insides
are okay to run without air going through them.
