Subject: crankshaft gear has no timing marks

I'm glad I waited until Monday to take my open case to the local shop. We
put the engine into direct sunshine and still couldn't see the two
indentations on the crankshaft gear. So the mechanic pulled off the gear
from the crankshaft. Once it was off, the two dots were right there as if we
should have been able to see them. He said that was the tightest one he has
seen in his experience of over a hundred rebuilds. He got another one from
the back of his shop and after heating it up, installed it. The dots were
quite visible now. The new cam, a "0", meshed with this gear fine.
