Subject: How Much Paint?

For you folks who have painted there Bus recently;  How much paint did it
take.  I thinking 2 qts of White (above the beltline) and 2 qts of Blue (below
the beltline).  Then 1 gallon of clear, may be using House of Kolors lacquer
based clear so I can paint it in my garage.
