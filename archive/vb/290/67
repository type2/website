This may be the last one.  We have been in Lake Havasu City, AZ at John & Denise's helping out and working on the VW show that happens here in January.  Also a little time for garage sales and boy is the truck full now.  We will be headed home this (monday) morning.  It looks like the smoke has cleared so it is time to drive the last leg of this trip.  It will feel good to be home and also sad the trip is over.  But in our usual style we only have a few days then back on the road to see family and get ready for the holidays.
