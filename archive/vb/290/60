Haven't done the job yet (rained here this weekend)
but, yes, of course. I'm an anal retentive chef under the bus.

I have permatex blue, because they sold in in a caulk-tube style. It's auto grade silicone with a high temp listing on it as well.  Does anyone have any BAD experiences with the blue?

I'm currently going thru the entire linkage. New shift/stop plate, new front bushing, new front bushing carrier, the front coupler screw was missing!
Is this a VW part (same screw as the rear?)

Damn! The new one I have is off by about 1/16".
How do you tell if my old one (bolt holes in line)
Is stiff enough to be good to reuse?  I don't want to send couplers back and forth in the mail for the rest of the year!

My stuff was pretty dry and funky. I know that pin is supposed to stick into the slot in the front of the housing, but the spring seemed to be set up to push the pin back and away from there. Can some one give me the setup?

The flat stop side goes on the left and the curved side of the plate goes on the right, correct?

>Use grease anywhere you feel you need to.

Now you're gettin' personal.
