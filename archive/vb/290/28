Subject: Looking for a Club/Group

Hello,

Does anyone know of a club/group in the Fairfield/Vacaville/Dixon CA area?
I recently bought a '64 splittie (my first-ever VW!) and I'm going to need a
lot of advice.  The bus doesn't have too much body rust, except the front
floor pan will need replacement. I was told it has an 1800 '74 engine. The
previous owner put dual Solex (Kadron) carbs on it. I guess my next question
would be: "How do I positively identify the size of the engine so I can get
the correct parts?" I've found but a few parts and add-ons/upgrades for the
1800. Would it be wise to replace it with a 1600?

Thanx,
Angus
