The split-bus-only show is at the VW dealership in Tampa (unless things
have changed).  The name isn't coming to mind right now...but the Saturday
show is Bulli Brigade.  Sunday is the Bug Jam at the Dade County Fair
Grounds (IIRC and if it hasn't changed..), which is a few miles north of
Tampa.

Don't think I'm gonna make it this year, alas.
