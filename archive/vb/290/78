I put two new boxes in my '64 Bus (with '68 Beetle 1500 SP) without
taking down the engine, and it worked OK.  One note: I didn't install
the box-to-body hoses then, because I didn't have the right sizes.
If you end up with one end about 10 mm bigger around than the other
end, Ronnie at Old Volks can fix you up with hoses that will fit.
These hoses sort of screw together, so I didn't have any trouble
when I put them on later - I just screwed them a little too short,
put them in place, and unscrewed them.

You might get a muffler kit, as you will break something taking the
old boxes (if any) off, and consider the copper nut kits that some
vendors sell for the heater box flanges.
