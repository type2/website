Hi Ray,
That is what we thought and additionally since nobody has invented a self

Very interesting!  Since the doghouse bus engine was (at least for the 
American market) a one year only item we will figure that VW decided it was best to 
increase sealing around the cooler!  Would be fantasic to find an OG 1971 bug 
engine that had never been removed since it left from the factory and see if 
it had the same lack of foam as the bus one you have...............
