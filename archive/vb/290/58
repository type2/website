Hello Angus,
 
 There are a few clubs in your area.
 
Split Bus Clubsplitbc(-at-)aol.com 
Old School Air Cooled 

SV2's have a chapter in San Jose, a little far from you, but they have members worldwide as well. www.sv2s.com 
 
I would search www.thesamba.com as well, Everett has a "clubs" section there as well. On the advise of my attorney I will leave the motor questions to other members of the list!
