Not me, but I used it until my mechanic friend turned me onto the Ultra
Grey or Ultra Black - denser, sets up quicker, tougher in general, never a
failure. The plain blue is okay, I used it for years; I just prefer the
Ultra now (Permatex).

Take a vise grip to each end and twist - there should be no play. If there
is play with hand pressure, you're losing torque and it'll be sloppy or
not go into gear. Probably also ready to break. This is critical - ask me
blah blah... The reason 1/16" is critical is that the shifter knob is two
feet away  from the axis of the shift rod. When you move the shifter from
the 1-2 position to the 3-4 position, you're moving the knob about four
inches or so. That's about 9 degrees of rotation.  Down at the rod, if you
give the rod a radius of about 1/2", the 9 degree angle of rotation works
out to 1/12" of an inch, a bit more than 1/16". Neat, eh? Ask me what I
went thru alone, decades before the list existed to figure this out.

I'll stay away from this one for now!
