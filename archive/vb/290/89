I agree with Cal. I used Blue religiously for thermostat housings and
other places where the temp was reasonable and needed a water seal, but
the the Ultra gray/black is the best for the tranny job as far as I'm
concerned. Seen it used on the seals of the RGB also.

Not me, but I used it until my mechanic friend turned me onto the Ultra
Grey or Ultra Black - denser, sets up quicker, tougher in general, never
a failure. The plain blue is okay, I used it for years; I just prefer
the Ultra now (Permatex).
