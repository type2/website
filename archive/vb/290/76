As Clara said, this is a '67.  If you were looking in the VW literature,
this number would probably be written as 237 095 482.  It was probably
made sometime between mid-February and early March of 1967, per listings
in a book that's not online.

>(The bus is in South Africa)

Are you in South Africa too?  You might get in touch with Christian
Figenschou, who is (used to be?) on this list.  He woke up in South
Africa one day, jumped in his Bus with his girlfriend, headed north,
and got to Germany before they caught him...

Yes.  If you're not very familiar with cars, the "Idiot" manual by
John Muir is a good second purchase, and a good read even if you
already know "how works a Volkswagen".
