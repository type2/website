I predict that the next message posted by Conrad Klahn will detail how some SOB
swooped into that location and tainted the shop owner by offering stupid
amounts for anything usable and cherry picked everything from the rarest of the
rare down to the single port engine tin.

Good luck Conrad. Keep the location close to your vest until you get what you
want.
