I'll support VW as much as they support me.  "Yeah, I need a 211-""Sorry,
not available.<click>"

On the other hand, that may be changing.  http://www.vw-classicparts.de/
does look interesting.  As far as I can tell with my limited German,
they've only got a small selection (or their sale parts) online, like
two rear brake hoses (211 611 775 B) for Eur 10.  They seem to invite
calls to ask about parts not listed:

Oh yeah, they also have parts manuals.  The scans are better than the
doc project ones, but they're just the pictures - no part numbers:
