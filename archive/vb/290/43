Click and save.  This should play with windows media player.  When I tried
playing it, WMP said it didn't recognise the format, and did I want to play
it anyway [maybe I don't have the right codecs or ??]  but I said, "try to
play anyway" and it did.  I think I counted 36 buses in the cruise, but I
was the caboose and I just got out and started with the bus in front of
mine.

You are driving down the Highway of Life. .
You spot another VW in the opposite lane ...
As you pass,hands go up ...
Eye contact is made and you both smile ...
VW's are more than just transportation ...
They're your soul, your inner peace ...
and sometimes your worst nightmare.
