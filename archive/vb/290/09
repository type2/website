Here I am....cable modem took a dive last week :-(.  

Well, while I think I have a BN-4 around somewhere, I've only worked
with the earlier (read simpler) models.  Same basic design, just not as
many safety features(circuts/relays and such).  

I've restored a "Stationary 56" (1960 model) and tinkered with a few
others.  Most of the problems I've ever had have been with the fuel
pump...fairly temperamental although simple in design.

T2.com has all the pics and long ago listee Ron Van Ness wrote up some
good info on BN-4's.  Its all under heating.  Here:

Wow I just noticed all the good articles by Ron are down :-(  Anybody
have those or have Ron Van Ness's email??
