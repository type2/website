Welcome to the jungle...  :)

The engine number will give you a good idea.  It will be somewhere on
the right rear of the engine, and relatively easy to read as you sit
behind the Bus.

When you open the engine lid, do you see something like this
http://66.34.72.138/gallery/image/2005179d.JPG ?  If so, then you have
a Type 4 engine, which originally came in 1700, 1800, and 2000 cc sizes.

If you see something more like this
http://66.34.72.138/gallery/image/2248.JPG , then you have a Type 1
engine.  These originally came in 1200, 1300, 1500, and 1600 sizes.

It's also possible to do an "upright" conversion on a Type 4 engine,
so the fan is on top of the engine instead of behind it, but these
are relatively rarer.

Anyway, once you have the engine number (a letter or two followed
by about five or six numbers), look it up in the "Engine Codes"
links on http://www.type2.com/library/identifi.htm .  This will
tell you what the engine should have been originally.  With either
engine, a smaller size can be rebuilt to a bigger size, so it's
hard to know exactly what you have without taking the engine apart.

>Would it be wise to replace it with a 1600?

IMHO: If it runs good, leave it alone.  It should make more power than
a 1600 or the stock 1500.  But if the engine has problems, the Type 4
engine parts are rarer and more expensive than the Type 1 engine parts.
If it needs major work, it may be cheaper to buy a rebuilt (or even a
new) 1600, but this does involve a drop in power output.
