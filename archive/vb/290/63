The stock tubes that connect the heaterboxes to the body of my bus (1964)
don't compress enough to put the heaterboxes on after the engine is
installed. I have to line them up as I install the engine. If you have hoses
that will compress enough, it might be just as easy to install them with the
engine installed.
