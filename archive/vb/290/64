Subject: Bob's Auto Salvage [Pennsylvania]

Bob's Auto Salvage [Pennsylvania] was recommended to me by someone
from the newsgroup more than a year ago.  I bought several things from
him back then for my 71 bus - no problem ..

Early this year I purchased a dash tray .. no problem and then a front
bumper.
He had a few, he gave me prices .. I bought the most expensive because it
was supposed to be "perfect."  Something he was going to use for himself.
[wasn't] and it also was supposed to include steps.  [didn't]

I immediately called and asked "where are the steps?"  He gave me some
crappy answer like the one he gave me for the bumper shipping so late.
Weather I think ....

Called a few more times, he made promises he would send the steps.  [didn't]
Today I sent him one final email asking for my steps, told him I wanted a
tracking number by the end of the week and I would post the results here.

Damn I hate getting screwed .. I mean, I was willing to pay the additional
money to get what I wanted and needed .. He had my money for a month before
shipping the front bumper.

Anyone know of him or what's up with him or ????

PS .. If I turn around, will someone let me know if I have a "kick me" sign
on
my back ??
