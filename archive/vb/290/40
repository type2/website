Subject: Re: [VB] 65 new trans/one more time

I used to have this 59 truck.  Man it was solid, rust free, but needed lots 
of help.   Other than the engine with the three piece crank shaft, the drivers 
door flying open randomly, funky brakes, wiring issues, I was concerned when 
draining the tranny oil dropped out lots of grit and even chunks.   I put new 
axles boots and oil in the tranny and a motor (6V 40hp, converted it back to 
6V) and it shifted great, smooth no popping out of gear.  Big thunk when you 
step on or off the gas, (bad FPs) and no reverse.  Still, a deal for the price.   

Ended up replacing the shift coupler, as I noticed it was a BAY WINDOW one, 
and they drilled through the rear stick to put that kind in.   Put a new 
splitty one in, and I had reverse.  It was just at a slightly off angle with the 
hole they drilled.    

I recommend carrying a spare.

BE SURE that the two bolt holes are EXACTLY lined up - 1/16 th inch off is
a entire shift from 1-2 to 3-4. Find a coupler that 's made properly.
Don't settle for anything less. It won't work. I've seen couplers that
were so sloppily made, they couldn't possibly work. Ask me how I know!
