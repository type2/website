just to add to this. I'm not sure if Eberspaecher gives it's fuel
usage the same way as the stewart-warner heaters, but...one of the SW
manuals I read gave a usage per hour. It also noted that this was
burning full time, and gave a number around actual burn time was 30%
IIRC. So the actual fuel usage should be less. EB might have rated
their heaters the same way.

Since running my SW I have noticed a 1-2 mpg dip in milage. But who
cares, I'm warm!
