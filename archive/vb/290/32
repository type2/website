Besides what E&B said, you might check your float bowl and fuel tank
for crud.  Like, when the tank is flat or tilted back, the crud is
away from the outlet pipe/screen, but when it's tilted forward, the
crud plugs up the screen.

On a 30-PICT-2 and 30-PICT-3, the float is hinged at the front of the
bowl, so it might be a little more sensitive to tilt than the ones
like the 28-PICT that are hinged on the side.  Maybe a different
washer/spacer under the float valve would help - or at least make sure
the right one is in there, as there's usually a couple of different
thickness washers in the rebuild kit.

Since VW put the carb on the right way, this doesn't really apply, but
the pictures at http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/solex/Page-10.jpg
and http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/solex/Page-10.jpg (from a
Solex manual) might be interesting.

I hope this helps!
