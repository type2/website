Check out page 69** of the Eberspaecher BN4/BA6 manuals Thom has up at
http://66.34.72.138/techinfo/eber/index.html .  It says the BN4 would
put out 15,900 BTU/hr max, while using 0.20 to 0.65 liters/hr (0.42 to
1.4 US pints/hr) of fuel and 50 W (4 A) of electricity.

Consider that if your Bus is averaging 30 MPH, the engine is using
something like 1.25 US gallons (10 US pints) per hour, so the heater
is good for around a 4%-14% hit.  If you're averaging 50 MPH, that's
around 16.7 pints per hour, so the heater takes a 2.5%-8.4% hit on
your fuel mileage.

Bosch's Handbook says that regular gasoline has a chemical energy of
around 52,900-56,600 BTU per liter.  This implies that a BN4 is
something like 43%-46% efficient at converting the chemical energy
in the gasoline into heat.

** Page 2 says the BA6, as installed in later Buses, would put out
20,200 to 23,400 BTU/hr at max setting (and gives a value for the
stock heating system at 49,600 BTU/hr at max RPM).  It says at max,
it should take 1.1 to 1.3 liters/hr (2.3 to 2.7 US pints/hr) of fuel.
Electrically, it draws 240 to 400 watts (20 to 33 A) at start-up,
and then 100 to 260 watts (8 to 21 A) while running.  This says that
a BA6 is 27% to 40% efficient at converting the chemical energy in
the gasoline to heat.
