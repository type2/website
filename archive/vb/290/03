  Install a new shift coupler. Just because it is still together doesn't
mean that it isn't 
twisting. If it was oily when you took it out the rubber can be soft.

Subject: 65 new trans/one more time



Last time I installed my new trans, I couldn't get it to shift gears and I
was leaking gear oil.

1. didn't know the paper shims between the axle tube ring and the trans case
needed sealant. Okay, rookie manuever #1. I bought a caulking gun size tube
of permatex blue silicone #6XX.

2. checked out the nosecone last night. I was able to activate each gear,
one by one manually by pulling/pushing the sliders. I had them set up
properly the first time. this means there's something in the linkage, either
my mistake or maybe it's just so sloppy with age that it lacks the torque to
move this tight new trans around.

point is, I feel like the same thing's gonna happen when I put it in the bus
again. any thoughts?

I'm using the existing shift rod coupler, gear shift lever/linkage, I have a
new front bushing to install, new trans, new trans mounts front and rear.

Help!
