Subject: 60 sc sighting for sale in CT

I saw this one while driving last weekend, so I thought I'd pass it on.  
  I know nothing about it, or the business selling it, but my eyes  
jumped out out of my head since they're sooo rare up here.  If link  
doesn't work, I found it by searching bargainnews.com  "Special  
Interest 1960-64" with Volks as my make criteria.  I'm still in so much  
trouble for bringing the double cab home, that I even pretended not to  
notice it as we drove by :)
