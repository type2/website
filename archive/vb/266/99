I know I am jumping in late here and do not know the background leading up 
to this...

But from what I have seen posted here the mechanic seems to give reasonable 
explainations for what I consider extremely vague inquires.

- Grinding gears.  Could be the tranny.  Could be the linkage.  Check the 
play in the clutch pedal but if it is driveable I kind of doubt it is the 
cable actuation.

- Horn.  Yes the old buttons do break.  I doubt the actual wire is broken at 
all, just needs a new button.  Of course the actual horn probably could be 
changed as well, a whopping one bolt and 10 minutes later.

- Fuel sender.  Very robust in a splittie.  If anything is amiss i would 
suspect the dash mounted guage.  Best bet (non-vintage) is to install a new 
VDO unit.  Very easy to replace.

- Hard brakes.  Is a good thing.  Dragging brakes, not a good thing.  Jack 
up bus and spin wheel, if little to no drag from the brake shoes then it is 
perfect.  If it is hard to turn then the brake shoes are too tight.  Or a 
very easy test is to let the bus coast and if it slows down due to brake 
drag then there is an issue.

I know it is difficult at first to understand how some of these systems 
work, but after looking at the Bentley and poking around you will soon 
become very familiar with the bus-be-workins.  Just be sure never to buy new 
muffler bearings ;)  Also watch out for "710" issues!  lol

Good Luck,
