Subject: RE: [VB] fair price for a progressive carb manifold

You can buy a cheap wide mouth progressive center section out of the mags for
$65 brand new. If you have the two into one that goes for $85 brand new. If
you have the large tube center section and large tube end pieces you can get
$100 or more used for that since new factory end pieces are $35.

hey volks,

i was hoping to get some advice:
what's a fair price for a manifold{currently has a weber progressive on
it}
what's a fair price for the carb? {i know that most people either love em
or hate em, i have no experience either way, so i don't care...}

the reason is, i'm selling them and i want to list a fair price.

thanks,
matthew
