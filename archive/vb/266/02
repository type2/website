Subject: RE: I give up

Yeah I think what happens(to me anyway) is there is a fine line between what
needs to be fixed right now, and what I need my bus for right now...in a
perfect world I would have a month to work on my bus full time, and put
everything else on hold...but reality kicks in and I have to use my bus for
work, or to get somewhere...the daily driver conundrum....
