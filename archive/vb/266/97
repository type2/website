My bus does not grind when going into gear, and I am
driving a split-case tranny. Every once in a while it
does when going into first, but that is just me trying
to jam it too fast, and is my fault exclusively, not
the tranny.
Maybe the clutch does need adjusting. How much
freeplay do you have in the pedal before the clutch
starts to engage (should be about 1" before it hits
resistance)? This freeplay amount should tell you
pretty fast if it needs adjustment. 
Also, maybe the bowden tube, the plastic lined tube
between the metal tube that runs in the frame for the
clutch cable and the bracket on the tranny, has too
much or not enough bend (preload) to it. This could
also cause chattery clutch and/or sloppy/grindy
shifting if improperly adjusted or the wrong tube is
installed.
Sounds like you're dealing with a real winner.
