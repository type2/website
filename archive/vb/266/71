Hi Rex,
Great job on the DC!
I think it looks good sans flames, but it is your toy and you should go 
with your gut feeling.
You could try Photoshopping in flames on those pictures you posted and 
get  a list vote!
On a side note, how well does that mirror work?
Cheers,
Andres (now i want a pritschenwagen) Yver
