hey Diane,
	This job is an easy one that is hard to mess up. Yup putting the
new drag link in the bus and adjusting it so the wheel points straight
should take but about 20 minutes if you take your time. HOWEVER
getting the old one off is a royal PITA. I have a nice 2/3 jar puller
I use that works ok, but I can't really get to the joints well,
because of the other suspension. There is a tool made that supposedly
makes this job a lot easier, but I haven't used it. It is easy, just a
pain to get the old ends out of their home for 40 years. but then
again, I'm a pain to move also :)
