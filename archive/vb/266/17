Subject: Re: [VB] Few simple questions & steering wheel

Diane, more power to you!
Yes, you did right in posting that achievement.
As you probably found out, the little jobs that seem
esay often turn out more difficult & are more than
just small victories.
It's only after similar jobs that I'm FINALLY
considering taking on my first engine re-build.
Not that I'm saying you'll end up doing that, but
doing the sort of stuff you told us about is an
ultimately satisfying way of having links with your
own vehicle, even if it takes you 5 times longer than
you thought & makes you 10 times dirtier :o)
As far as the horn wire, steering wheel questions,
there is a special circle in hell reserved for people
like your former mechanic.
What he could've done was taken the spring out, put it
in a safe place, and put the button back on, leaving
lots of space for the wire & having the steering wheel
look better & safer.
What this guy think he is?
Does he leave his shop to hunt woolly mamoth for
dinner & go home to his cave at night?
It certainly sounds like he applied his caveman's club
to your engine case!
Cro-magnon mechanic.
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
