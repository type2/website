WOW!!!!!  I'ld like to know what part of the country you can find a good 
running Wasserboxer for that price.  Perhaps it is possible now a days since so 
many water cooled vanagon owners are throwing away their engines and going with 
the Subaru conversion.  It is a well documented fact that the wasserboxes 
motor was one of the biggest and costliest mistakes that VW ever made.  I'm 
certainly no vintage nazi and have nothing aginst a watercooled in a splitty.  My 
best friend has a Subaru in his '63 DC.  I just think the Wasserboxes would be 
the last engine that anyone would want to graft INTO any vehicle.

As for a 'quick freshen up, I suppose that's possible, if you don't mind 
spending nearly $2 grand!  And that's not a full rebuild.

For the same $2 grand, I have a 1904 (74 stroke X 90.5) aircooled in my DC, 
and it's NEW, not rebuilt.  New case, heads, P/C, cam, oil pump, etc., etc.  
Plenty of power to haul around a camp trailer or whatever.  It runs a pair of 
Kadrons and a cheap EMPI header (for now).  I haven't upgraded the stock big nut 
tranny yet, but that's coming.  Right now it has a 'comfortable' top speed of 
about 60-65 (no tach), but it gets there really quickly.  It will bark the 
tires in 1st and 2nd (I don't like doing it, but had to try it once:)).

Anyway, that's just my (meaningless to some) opinion,
