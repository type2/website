Subject: Bad Football?

Is it "bad football" to use an aftermarket custom part that someone 
else bought from a vendor and copy the design/work to fabricate 
something simular for yourself?

For example...dropped spindles...or straight axle kits...or front 
disc brake kits....or T4 upright fanshrouds...or safari windows...or 
whatever?

Is there anything "wrong" with doing this? Not legally...maybe just ethically.

I don't think so, but was curious what others think.
