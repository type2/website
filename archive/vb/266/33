I think that's the idea; the bigger head may let you put more torque
on it, and the area spreads out the clamping force better.  On the
other hand, I can also argue that you _have_ to torque the big nut
down more than the stock one, because if you tighten it to the same
torque, you have the same clamping force spread out over a wider
area, which might actually make the joint _weaker_.
