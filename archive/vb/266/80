You're kidding, I assume? You NEED the horn for safety. The mechanic tore
it out and threw it in the back? Yer kiddin me! You need to get your car
out of there asap, and find a real mechanic to work on it, or begin doing
the work yourself.

You're not being picky at all. If it ain't right, it ain't right. You pay
them real money don't you? They take it, right? Yer supposed to get the
job you paid for - do you have a BetterBusiness Bureau there? This shop
should be closed down.

dumbfounded!
