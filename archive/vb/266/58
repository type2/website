Hi Diane,
If you work some hand goop under your mails before doing greasy work the dirt 
will work out alot easier and using vinyl gloves helps alot.

Hopefully when the drag link end was reinstalled it was greased to help 
prevent it from sticking so much.  You can easily do the work on establishing toe 
in by pulling out your "Idoit's Guide" by John Muir.  You really do need to get 
the Bentley Shop Manual for the 1963-67 VW bus!!!!

Clutch is easy, brakes are easy to adjust, but make sure to check that the 
master cylinder and the brake pedal push rod has about 1/32" or .030" or 1mm 
space beteen them or the brakes will just get tighter and tighter as you use them 
and burn the brake pads up!!!!!  All because the brake fluid pressure can not 
be relieved back into the brake fluid reseviour.

You might be able to adjust that or it might need a new set of properly sized 
jets in it.  Oil pressure and oil temp are real engine lifesavers!!

All stuff you can do or at least take a swing at this weekend.
