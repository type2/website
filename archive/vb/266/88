Subject: 1961 Double Cab... 08-10-03

Today I decided to get the double cab on the road to test the 
shifting again. On my last test drive I got fast enough to shift to 
4th, but it wouldn't go...it just would grind. When I got it out and 
up to speed today, it again just did the same thing.

I seem to remember getting into 4th before, but in all honesty I 
probably shifted to it too low and didn't really test it right. Who 
knows.

When I got back I adjust the shift handle base up front and tested it 
again. Same issue. Did this a few times and nothing worked. I checked 
the the tranny fluid and it was low.

I found StA-LUBE GL-4 at O'Reiley's here. I usually buy it at NAPA, 
but they're closed on Sunday here. Glad to know another store stocks 
it.

Emptied the old stuff and filled with new. Test drive...still grinding.

So it looks like my tranny is bad. I decided to stop doing anymore 
work to the truck. I'm gonna drive it around town with the three good 
gears it's got until I either find a good used tranny, get enough 
money to buy a rebuild, or this one breaks down completely.

I'll put the word out here locally that I need a good working swing 
axle tranny. I hate to spend any kind of cash or more time on this 
project, but mechanicals are important. So if push comes to shove 
I'll order low buck rebuild. But it's time for me to stop having fun 
with the toys again and get back to work on our fixer upper house. My 
wife has been very patient and I need to reward her and the kids by 
getting our place in shape.

So that's it for now. It'll stay the way it is other than a few small 
things I need to tend to. But it is what it is. I love driving it. It 
gets lots of attention and drives pretty darn good. Even with the bad 
tranny it shifts and runs great up to 3rd. That seems to be about 
30-35 MPH top cruising around speed for this truck. That will be 
enought to get me by in my small town. Just gotta stay off the 
highway!

So the truck story is done for the time being. Thanks for all the 
help along the way and for reading my daily diaries.

I figure when they show up on the vintagebus archives I can search 
for "1961 Double Cab..." and have them all to look at again and print 
out for myself.

Take it easy!
