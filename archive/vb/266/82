Up from the bottom works better - you can't thread it in from the top.

Actually, the technique is to pull up under the Golden Gate Bridge at
night, have a friend climb the west tower and toss a heavy chain down over
the edge of the bridge, then secure it on the bridge. Then you both haul a
large winch, gasoline powered, onto the bridge sidewalk, the south side to
be exact. Next, you guide the chain down from the bridge, into the hole
that you cut into the roof of the bus, and wrap it around the steering
wheel. Be sure to remove the horn button first! And dettach the horn wire.
Use a padlock to secure the end of the chain to itself after wrapping
around the steerin wheel. Start the bus's engine, and let it warm up.
Next, pack the lower edge of the steering wheel around the pole, just
above the knee guard, with a small amount of plastic explosive putty, and
embed a fuse wire into the putty, going all the way around the pole...
continued next week.
