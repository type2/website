Considering the fact that I have seen only half a dozen daily drivers that
were as close to factory original as you can get, I don't think there is much
wrong with aftermarket parts. Heck, you can build complete engines, wiring
harnesses, and many of the common accessories from mag ads without one
certified VW part. The Aluminum engine I am putting together has no VW parts
in it at all and I am not in the least concerned.

Word of warning, don't talk like this around Dave Mayes, I've seen how his
eyes can glaze over when looking at a long sought after screw or bolt or even
a washer!

Is it "bad football" to use an aftermarket custom part that someone
else bought from a vendor and copy the design/work to fabricate
something simular for yourself?


Is there anything "wrong" with doing this? Not legally...maybe just
ethically.

I don't think so, but was curious what others think.
