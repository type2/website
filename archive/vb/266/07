  As of today

  I have to hand it to John Jones at Kustom Coach Werks he doesn't BS
around. I wasn't even expecting him or his crew to even start working on my
DC till after the Colorado shows this weekend being he's just finishing up a
beautiful 21 window   
http://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/index.mv?photo+101919.jpg   and has other
projects but I got this surprize today and he said they have only worked on
it four days!

  I am getting excited, I haven't had a done bus for a few years and have
never owned a totaly RESTORED one. 
The hardest part is putting it all back together, yet not as anal as the
infamous Dave Mayes, I HOPE!
