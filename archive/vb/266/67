Don't know about anyone else, but ( assuming that it was made out of a DEAD
DC ), I think that the way they built that trailer at the start of the 3rd
row is really clever. Gotta make you think, if you've got DCs etc in the
position of having to remove most of, if not all, the tray for repairs, (
like me, Rob K & quite a few others ) of whether it'd be viable to brace the
framework & do the tray that way for optimal access to storage, engine etc.
( IMHO )

 Don't s'pose the owner of that trailer's on the list? If so, I'd love to
hear from you about any issues with building it that way, please.
