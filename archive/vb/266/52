Here is the perfect engine!

Oxy-boxer 2.1L (76.4x94) with K-jetronic fuel injection using Beetle L-jet 
basis parts.  Hydro lifters.  mazda RX-7 oil cooler - BIG. And T1 exhaust 
with a Bus A1 phat boy (from ac.net).  Maybe a CB Performance hideaway turbo 
later on :)

Eric, just say no to water!  But waterboxers are very robust engines, just 
have head issues.  The bottom ends are solid.

All this backed up by IRS rear end with 3.88 R&P single side plate Super 
Beater tranny using T4 CVs thanks to a Old Speed weld in IRS kit.  To stop 
the power, Porsche 944 disc brakes all around sporting  Phone Dial 15x7 
wheels and Kumho tires.

... Still in search of a dang full roof rack!  Looks like I might have to 
splurge for the Tom Conner new rack.  Any old one is too expensive for 
raggedy old metal in my opinion...  Remember VWs are cheap.  The prices for 
used cr(-at-)p lately are outrageous!  99.9% of people consider it junk, price it 
accordingly.


Later,
