Subject: Re: [VB] Few simple questions.

> OTHER ... The bus at one time looked like a homeless shelter on the inside.
 VW parts - seats etc - stored in the back.  When I finally cleaned it out I
 had the original back seat and a newer seat, looks like one for a late 70's
 bus.  The green and blue plaid .. you can see it in the pictures on my site
 page www.qoam.com/67bus.htm

 When the mechanics were putting the bus together they installed the plaid
 seats instead of the originals because it required LESS work ..but I do want
 them in there.  Some sort of cross bar was installed in the back of the bus at
 some point in order to use those seats.  Any way, the point is . .those seats
 are in pretty perfect shape.  Is this something I should sell or toss in the
 trash ?? I don't know if this is something people are in need of.

If the seat is full width, as it appears in the pic, it is from a 74-75 Westy.... 74-75 was
the only years that were full width. Only problem is the space at the ends. Split buses are
wider than bays, so you end up with an inch of space on each end.
Look at the metal plate on the front of the wood. It will say Campmobile 70 then have a 4 or 5 stamped in it,
then a black dot, then 5 or 6 numbers stamped in it. The number stamped between
70 and the black dot is the year of the Westy it came out of. 4 for 74, 5 for 75.
Not sure why someone put in cross braces. That seat will bolt right in if you have a jig saw. You have to cut
slots in the bottom for the heater log and make the oval holes 1/2" longer to the front for the tee bolts.
