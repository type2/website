Subject: RE: [VB] mcode 197

Hey Greg,

Yes, the firebus is geared quite low... or so it seams.  Its *screaming*
past 90 km/hour.  I asked earlier when I first got it if it was possible
to change the gear ratios in the rgbs... instead of reworking the whole
trans.

Let me know what your swiss bus has for mcodes.

David

How is your Firebus geared?

My Swiss Highroof is geared very low (60-65 top speed low) I'm not sure 
if it has M code 197, but I'll check.
