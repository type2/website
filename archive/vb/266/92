Subject: fog lights

So,  as everyone knows, tail lights on an early bus are kind of a joke.  I'm
thinking about mounting a couple of auxiliary lights on my 60.  Maybe, just
sort of clamp em on the bumper some how and wire them into my brake lights.  I
have a set of 70's fog lights new and still in the box.  If I used em as brake
lights would the fact that they are yellow fog lights be an issue?
