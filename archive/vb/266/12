Hey all,

Hope no one minds a little roll over from the new Samba forums.  But I have 
been blown away by how many Rivieras are out there and how many are 
crawling out of the woodwork lately.  I've chosen to take this as a sign to 
move forward with a project I've been kicking around....

The Riviera Registry.

Okay, so they never really documented these campers too well, but it 
doesn't mean we can't have a go at it.  Initially what I want to do is get 
emails from people who have Rivieras and get their names, bus years, and 
locations.  My hope is to create a site where Riviera owners can share 
information, parts, stories, images, etc.

Please email me if you have a Riviera and can give me some info on it.  If 
you want to send me some pictures of it, please email me first as I'll be 
out of town from 8/10 to 8/16.  If you just want to send information, email 
anytime.  And if you have one of those latches for the sliding windows, 
email me right now!!

-Taylor
