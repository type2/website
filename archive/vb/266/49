Whew! Guess you don't like them then, huh?
:-)

We've been finding WBX longblocks for $500, no problem. Running even. Threw a
new gasket set and bearings in one and it runs great. I found one for $700,
30K since last rebuild, complete with the FI on it and everthing. If only I
had $700 at that time!  :-)

Granted, new heads are expensive, new pistons and cylinders are expensive, and
all that, but if you find a running one that hasn't been trashed and doesn't
need those parts replaced, they aren't that much to freshen up, certantly no
$2000 bucks.

You also have to consider that they were pushing around 5000 lb. vehicles. We
still have to see how a Subaru motor holds up to pushing 5000 lb. vehicles on
a daily basis for 10 plus years, when it was designed for a car weighing 3000
lbs.

Which is another good reason to me, for installing a WBX into a split bus. The
split bus weighs a LOT less than a vanagon does. Close to 40% less. With
gearing that is not as tall, it should work just fine.

Then add in that the WBX will bolt right in. No expensive adapters needed.
Exhaust? Use a T1 exhaust, they're cheap and will bolt right on. Find some
40IDF's on ebay or the swapmeets for cheap, and you're good to go.
