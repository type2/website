> Hey Dave:

sounds like that you have a real good handle on this topic so I though you
minght give me your advice on a good bus engine. I've tried a lot of
different combos over the years (I really like a 1641 sp, but kinda slow)
and I want to build another engine and want to maintain reliability with
some good power (I'm thinking about 100 HP). What configuration engine would
you build for a splittie, with RBs, with 3.88 RP/0.82 4th.

OK, then-
That "Big Bore" 1641 is 2 1/2% larger than 1600,
which is 1% larger than the actual 1584 cc. wow.

Let's forget about the "power to weight" ratio !

Keith wants power AND reliability, then quantifies
power requirement at 100 HP combined with a
"Freeway Flier" transaxle, the proverbial "Overdrive"
get-sumpthin-for-nuthin gearbox that generates
80mph on the flat but bogs down at the first hill.
Actually, it will climb, if you keep you foot into it :)

No problem ! Keith failed to add "Cheap" as a Quantifier !

There is an improved ( read expensive :) part for
every component in a T1 engine, which will fit
these requirements. Are we now confined to the T1
platform, or can we now discuss T 4, or Porsche ?

Are we loaded with CASH ??!!!

> Hey List- I recently posted a request for advice on the compression ratio
that I should run on an engine I am making plans to build. This got me to
wondering what the list's idea is for the Ultimate Bus engine? Give me your
idea.

(hey what else is there?), has the common 3.88 or maybe 4.12 R&P, with the
common 0.82 4th gear, and tire size will be as close to the Bently height
specification of 27.0 inch plus or minus 0.12 inch for the 15 inch rim and
26.0 inch plus or minus 0.12 inch for the 14 inch rim.

reliability/longevity  and power as the main goal. What displacement engine?
carburetion? Cooling? Compression? Heads? Exhaust?

and the things that have been proven to work good.

OK, then- the gearbox-type request has been modified.
Looks like we have the tire size  "exactified" to within 1/8"
( give or take an inch :) !!!
Actually, these same requests boggled the minds of
many engineers half a century ago.
Their answer was 1584 cc.
