Subject: the Term "Split Window"

First, lemme zipper up my asbestos flame suit.

I don't like, and very rarely use, the terms "Split Window" or "Splittie"
Early buses came first.  They are buses.  Bay window buses are ... bay window
buses.  The term "split window" implies that they have to be distinguished
from buses - but they are buses.  Also, the window isn't split - there are two
of them. If I have to refer to my bus such that I distinguish it from a bay
window bus then I call it "my early bus"  or "my 60."  Am I alone in this?  Do
I need to just get a grip?

jdd 60 std (early bus,)  78 westy (bay window fat chick)
