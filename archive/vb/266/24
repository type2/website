Subject: re:steering wheel

I have never taken one off, but I hear the best method is to cut a hole in
your roof, tie a winch to the wheel, and up over a tree...then crank it
out...it is supposed to be pretty hard.

As for the horn wire, I thought it would be really hard, but I did the wire
on mine, no problem. I can't remember if I went in from the top, or up from
the bottom.
