Hey Steve

Thanks for the info about the 'run razor'  it worked perfectly - perfectly.


> Go to a body shop store in your area and get something called a "run
razor". These are little tools make specifically to remove runs in paint
jobs. These tools use a razor to shave away the run area and leave the area
around the run untouched.
>
> You use the razor to cut the run almost completely down to the level of
the paint around it and then use 600 grit sandpaper to do the final
smoothing. After this, buff it back to the original shine with buffing
compound.
>
> If you try and use sandpaper to get it out, you will be sanding the area
around the run as well as the run itself. Most likely, you will end-up
sanding through the paint around the run and will have to re-spray. Also, it
will take you all day and 3 or 4 packs of paper to sand away a run with 1500
grit. 1500 grit is used when you want to color sand clear coat or single
stage urethane to get out very fine defects in the paint.
