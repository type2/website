Subject: RE: gland nut questions/airs help

Yeah that is the type of gland nut he had used-it had a bigger head(1 7/8")
but it was thinner, which made getting a socket on it a bit more
difficult...but we got it off. I don't know if I understand the performance
advantage? Maybe it distributes the torque better?

Later editions of the Idiot manual (mine is the "25th anniverstary
edition, printed February 1996) have a "Hi-Performance Modifications"
chapter.  In it, it says "Some aftermarket gland nuts have heads that
are so big they interfere with clutch operation.  Better quality nuts
have thinner heads but retain their strength."  I'm not sure whether
the "bigness" means thickness of the bolt head, or the wrench size it
takes.  According to both Muir and Wilson (How to Rebuild...), the
stock wrench size is 36 mm or 1 7/16".
