Subject: I tried ... got filthy dirty .. and failed ...

I tried and couldn't get the drag link off .. My boyfriend was at work and I 
don't know any of my neighbors really .. anyway .. they are ALL older than 
me .. Wouldn't think of asking them to crawl under my bus .. Do I get credit 
for trying ? Do I get credit for the stuff that I will NEVER get out from 
under my fingernails ??

Took it to the new guy .. he used some sort of electric tool .. he said that 
was "his hammer."  It was on there for good ... The steering wheel 
straighted somewhat but he told me to take it immediately to the only place 
he knows that can do the front end [toe in??] .. The one and only person 
there that does the buses won't be back until Monday.

He drove the bus .. said he was shocked that I was driving it with the 
steering THAT BAD .. said the clutch needs to be adjusted because it grinds 
in each gear if you aren't very careful and slow to shift.  Said the brakes 
also need adjustment because [can't remember his exact words] but there is 
no room to press down.  They don't give .. or they are stiff .. or maybe all 
those things ...

Said the engine is racing and should be adjusted .. that I need to be 
careful to not run it hot and to get some sort of gauge for the temp.  I had 
one in my 71 bus .. the mechanic from hell disconnected it .. said it was 
unnecessary .. I should have removed it from the bus then ..

That's about it.  Maybe I can do the clutch or brakes or adjust the racing 
myself this weekend ?? Mean while, I am going to call around .. there MUST 
be someone else that can do the front end ..
