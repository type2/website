Was  writ:
the gas station was going to charge me ..ready for this ??? $55 for 1 hour
work.  NO WAY . that $55 paid for my front chrome emblem.

Actually $55/hour is on the lower end(not the lowest)...but I think you just
learned an important VW lesson. Fix it yourself...the only trouble with this
lesson, is that sometimes you can't fix it yourself, or you get it apart to
only realize you are a little over your head...and depending on your
patience and the necessity of your vehicle on a daily basis-things can get a
little hairy...
