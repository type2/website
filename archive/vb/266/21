This is why shops many times charge more money than we want to pay. They 
get in there and it becomes a major pain in the ass. People expect to pay a 
basic fee when in reality the mechanic had to deal with rusted, broken, 
patched, rigged, parts and components.

I'm cheap so do the work myself instead of paying. Takes longer, but I 
learn and next time that part needs routine maintanence I can count on it 
being a little easier.
