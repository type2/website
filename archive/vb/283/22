Out of curiosity, I went to UPS.com and entered in the specs for a
68"L x 24"w x 6"h 25lb package from
Lakewood CA to Hamburg Germany.

OUCH!
depending on method, $271, $310 or $350

There's gotta be a better way.

Turns out that since it's so big, they calculate using "dimensional weight"
that bumps the weight up to 50-60 lbs
