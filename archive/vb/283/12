Subject: RE: Alternator question

That's what I thought. I hadn't tried pulling the can apart. Guess I'm going
to take a trip to the local wrecking yards and see if I can dig up a used alt
reg to check it out for differences.

I do have a Bosche 2 terminal set up but I was saving that for my second trike
1835 aluminum engine with the CB Performance serpentine belt system. Anyone
ever use one of these before? I haven't even got it out of the bubble yet!

Thanks

Ray

Get the right regulator.  The principle is the same - vary the duty
cycle of the field coil to vary the output of the electrical machine -
but the current values are different and the generator regulator has
stuff like a cutout relay that the alternator doesn't need.  The chances
of it working are lower than the chances of blowing an expensive part.
