Volks,

I went home last night and took the rim off, only to find that I had
not really thoroughly cleaned the inside portion very well . . . we were
working in the dark with a light.  So the Reline was oozing through onto
the outer side of the rim because of a sloppy cleaning job.  So I took a
close look at the bottom of the backing plate, and found it reasonably
clean, . . .one small tiny blob of Redline, not quite big enough to call
a drop.  

Rather than tear into it yet again, I think I'll put a few miles on her
and see what develops.  I have copied all the suggestions, so we have an
idea what to look for if and when we do pop the drum and 4 bolt for a
peek inside again.

Thanks volks,

Curt
