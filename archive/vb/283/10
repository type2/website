Oh boy, I guess I blew that question. I guess I sounded as if I'd never seen
anything electrical before. I guess the real question is if the generator
voltage regulator is the same voltage regulator that was used in the 73-74 bug
that this alternator came out of. From what I have seen, the generator voltage
regulator and the alternator voltage regulator have exactly the same labeled
terminals:
DF - field positive
D-  - field negative
D+ - Output
I was thinking that they are either the same or that both are different
voltage levels.

I have a few Generator VR's laying around but really would like to use the Alt
if the reg is the same. Don't really want to go down to FLAPS and spend $43 if
the gen reg works the same.
