Subject: RE: Bay window gas tank into a splitty

   In my DC I ran german fuel line from the bay tank breather to a "Y" fitting I put on the bay filler neck. The other end of the "Y" had more fuel line that was zip tied to the top of the compartment ceiling (uphill from the filler neck), through a filter and out the floor through an existing hole.
   This setup doesn't lose gas on lefthanders, eliminates all fumes from the interior, lets the tank breath, keeps dust out and vents benzene, etc. to the atmosphere. You could pick up a charcoal cannister from the junk yard to cut down on that last eco-unfriendly part.
    Enjoy some bad ascii art:

All,

Eric just hit on my next question, which was what exactly I should do about 
the breather line.  I know that some just plug them up, whereas others use 
Eric's neat filter idea.  Are there any other suggestions?  How do modern 
cars vent their gas tanks?  Should I build my own charcoal box?  Should I 
just run some line between the two breather ports (I am using a '73 tank in 
my splitty)?

I am worried about venting issues primarily because I will be using a
Webasto gas-powered heater in my bus which will be mounted in roughly the 
same place as an Eberspracher (sp) was, and I don't want to run any risk of 
blowing myself up from gas fumes.

Richard
