Subject: Re: [VB] oil bath air filter id

it's a 50s air cleaner for a 36hp bus, or barndoor truck.  People who want 
original aircleaners for stock vintage motors sometimes want them.

the 261 prefix is a dead giveaway that the part was first used on a truck 
(type 26), though I heard ghias used that style too (I dunno about ghias, really)

i recently came across an oil bath air filter that i cant identify.  somebody
told me it was for an early ghia, but it looks like it would be for an early
bus.  the part # on it is 261 129 611A.  the lower part screws on instead of
attaching with the bail clips like the style im used too seeing.  any help
would be appreciated.  thanks!
