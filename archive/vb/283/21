Okay, up till now I have been reluctant to use something like Dynamat to
reduce the noise as this has to be attached directly to sheet metal. Up till
now I have used 1/2" felt, which was okay,.....

....until I had to transport a couple of mattresses in the back. When I did
this it was dead quiet with very little engine noise coming thru to the front.
Can Dynamat or equivalent equal this noise level reduction??
