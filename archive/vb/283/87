You can work out some of it from section K (Kraftstoff) in the Bentley.
The parts manual can also help, but sometimes they will supercede
several early carbs to one later carb.  The "Without Guesswork"
manuals are pretty good for this.  There is also a Solex manual online
that will give you general advice about the carb...

Keep in mind that the jets can be changed, too.  A Bug and a Bus may
both take a 28 PICT, but the jetting _will_ be different.  Fortunately,
there are numbers stamped on the jets, so if you don't know, you can
take the carb apart and see.  This works pretty well as long as nobody
has attacked the jets with a drill bit.

Good luck!
