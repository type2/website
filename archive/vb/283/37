Subject: Distributor drive shaft ID and swap

All,

Here are two distributor drive shafts I recently picked up
http://members.cox.net/mattroberds/shafts.jpg and I'm trying to figure
out what I have.  They look remarkably like the picture on page M-9 2
of the '50-'62 Bentley; the one on the left is an earlier style and
the one on the right is the later style.  Is this accurate?

Part of the reason I am asking is that I am going to cut up one of
these shafts for a project.  If one is for a 25 hp or something
then I won't cut it.  If anyone has a drive shaft with a good
distributor end but a thrashed gear or fuel pump cam, I'll swap
you straight up for one of these and cut up the thrashed one.

Thanks!

Matt Roberds
