Subject: RE: Bay window gas tank into a splitty

All,

Eric just hit on my next question, which was what exactly I should do about 
the breather line.  I know that some just plug them up, whereas others use 
Eric's neat filter idea.  Are there any other suggestions?  How do modern 
cars vent their gas tanks?  Should I build my own charcoal box?  Should I 
just run some line between the two breather ports (I am using a '73 tank in 
my splitty)?

I am worried about venting issues primarily because I will be using a
Webasto gas-powered heater in my bus which will be mounted in roughly the 
same place as an Eberspracher (sp) was, and I don't want to run any risk of 
blowing myself up from gas fumes.

When I put my bay window tank in, I used the baywindows filler neck with it
as well. The angle of the filler neck isn't a perfect match to where the old

split tank went, but it works just fine. I couldn't bring myself to cutting
the neck off my early bus tank either. I have the old tank stored in the
basement with my other VW jank in case I put it back in someday.

One thing I had to do with my bay window tank, was the breather line that is

located on the top of the tank, I ran the breather line up by the cap,
which, when the tank was all the way full, It would slosh a bit of fuel out
of it on a hard left turn. I fixed that by installing a somewhat large fuel
filter up near the filler neck  as a sort of 'resivoir' for the fuel to
collect in and be able to drain back down, it also doubles as a filter to
keep dirt from getting in the tank from the breather line.
