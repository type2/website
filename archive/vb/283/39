Hi Bart,

Learn to go to Vintagebus.com and read the parts manuals that Thom,
Dave, and crew has graciously placed on line.  Instant satisfaction
there!

Bart asked:

I apparently lost the lower bolt that holds the right rear shock on.  I
pulled
into the garage today to change the oil and noticed it just hanging
there.  We
have a local hardware store that has just about every bolt you need in
both
metric and standard.  I really don't want to take the other side off and
was
wondering if someone knows how long and what size.  TIA.
