Check the area the seal rides on.   it must be smooth, no pits or grooves.  
very fine (600 grit) sandpaper can help.   Is it the seal holder?   can you 
tell if it leaks around the inside or the outside of the seal?   Just ideas.

Have seen some interesting PO things which were easier to follow than to 
replace oem, 
in this area.  which would mean both side had to be put together different.

sing the outer bearing to the irom bits from the break.  Since then,
we have been unable to stop a slow leak in the RGB on the passenger
side.  The RGB itself is tight, the leak is through the seal, and into
the brakes.  We  thought at first it was because we werent seating the
seal far enough down into the 4-bolt cover that goes against the backing
plate, but that doesn't seem to be the case.
