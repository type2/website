Subject: RE: Sound Proofing

In my humble opinion, there is NO equivalent to Dynamat -- at least, not if 
by "equivalent" you are referring either to "Brown Bread" or "Fat Mat," 
which are Dynamat alternatives.  The "alternatives" are thinner, harder to 
apply, less durable, more likely to peal, and just don't have the same sound 
deadening capabilities. I have used both in my cars -- and have ended up 
either pulling up the "alternative", or only using them as a second coat 
over a layer of Dynamat.

For redoing the interior of my splitty, as part of my complete 
resto-customization, I purchased four, 36-sq-feet bulk packs of Dynamat 
Extreme and two boxes of Dynamat Hoodliner.  I literally double-layered 
every square inch of the inside of my bus, EXCEPT for the front doors 
(because they tend to collect so much moisture) with the Dynamat Extreme.  I 
then put a layer of hoodliner in the engine compartment and another on top 
of the Dynamat over the engine hump inside the bus, and then put a layer of 
insulation (NASA aluminum-coated felt) followed by a vapor barrier 
everywhere I put Dynamat.

The above, combined with dual quiet-pack mufflers makes for a VERY quiet 
ride.  And as far as the worries about anything rusting under the Dynamat 
goes -- as long as you properly seal, prime, paint, and clear-coat the metal 
(as I did) and don't expose it to undue moisture, you shouldn't have to 
worry about rust.  Again, the inside of those front doors are an exception.  
For them, I just POR-15'ed the heck out of them and used small strips of 
Dynamat to deaden the loudest areas of offense -- like the door locks -- 
take care to keep away from any of the drain paths for the water.

Good luck!

Richard
