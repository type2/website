If I remember right, on my '64, the prong goes through that plastic
insulator and is riveted down inside the wiper motor.  If you can
get the motor open, you can probably solder a wire to the inner
wire and stick it out through the hole the prong used to go through.
Let it stick out a few inches and crimp a prong on the end of the
wire.

If you didn't snap it off right at the base, you can probably solder
a short wire to it.  You'll need a hefty soldering gun (100W+), not
a 30W iron.

Good luck!
