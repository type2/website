try the wax trick. Get a torch out (propane should work) heat up
around the bolt at least hot enough to melt wax. then when hot enough
place the wax there, it should melt and wick down the threads, helping
to move the bolt. 

note: I still have not tried this method, b/c I keep getting very luck
w/ pb blaster. I have several friends that swear by this method
though. worth a shot.
