Those things can get real stuck.  I have had some success by first
tightening them, just to break them loose.  Keep in mind that the last
time they were installed, the PO may have munged up the threads, so it
might take some effort to get them out, even after breaking them loose.
You might have to do the loosen some, tighten some thing to work them
out.  If you do have to drill them out, I would highly recommend
Timeserts to make the threads like new again (see the archives).

I guess if it comes down to it i'll have to grind the
head off, and drill it out. ugh.
