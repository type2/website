 Check to make sure the seal race isn't wobbling on the axle. I have found
this a couple times om buses and bugs when I couldn't stop an oil leak and
just by changing the race the problem was solved, dam these old cars!

Greasy Volks,

Last winter my son and I installed a rebuilt tranny I got from Ronnie. 
We had to replace a driver-side axle that broke at the paddle end, thus
exposing the outer bearing to the irom bits from the break.  Since then,
we have been unable to stop a slow leak in the RGB on the passenger
side.  The RGB itself is tight, the leak is through the seal, and into
the brakes.  We  thought at first it was because we werent seating the
seal far enough down into the 4-bolt cover that goes against the backing
plate, but that doesn't seem to be the case.  

Can't hardly drive it this way as it gets the brake shoes and drum
wet.

Ideas?  We put this baby together exactly the same way as we did the
driver's side.

Best,

Curt
