Subject: pressure plate rivit

In a little while, I'll be going to my VWFLAPS. but wanted a responce
from anyone who has seen this before. Last night the clutch acted like
it didn't want to disengage. well I managed to drive the 40miles home
with the clutch doing a lot of complaining. When I pulled the engine
and clutch this morning I noticed that one of the rivits that the
fingers of the pressure plate push against is seperating. is this
repairable, or do I just need to bite the bullet and get a new clutch
kit? I only ask since the plate and clutch are in good condition and
other than this not ready for replacement.
