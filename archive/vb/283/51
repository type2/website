Subject: 6 volt Speedo and fuel gauge/ 12 V conversion

Hey all- I just had a quick question-
I'm converting my 66 standard project to 12 volt. Will I need to find a set 
of 12 volt gauges? Or will mine work with a 12 to 6 voltage drop on them? I 
am somewhat attached to the gauges that are in there because they both work 
and are all original.
thanks in advance--- (see what blind faith I have in this list!!) :)
Kelly
