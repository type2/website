Get the right regulator.  The principle is the same - vary the duty
cycle of the field coil to vary the output of the electrical machine -
but the current values are different and the generator regulator has
stuff like a cutout relay that the alternator doesn't need.  The chances
of it working are lower than the chances of blowing an expensive part.
