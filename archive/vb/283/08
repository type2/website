Ben Stiles, who organizes Kampers Near Knoebels in Pennsylvania every
year, does not actually drive a VW bus as do most of the other
attendees, but in fact a Corvair van.  In fact a few of them show up to
KNK each year, and they mix well with the VW vans. (One might even argue
that with their aircooled engines, they are at least as much in the
spirit of the Bus than the multitude of watercooled Vanagons that attend
KNK, including mine.) The Corvair vans I've seen there include a factory
camper conversion that was sold by Chevy dealers as competition to the
Westfalia (sans poptop), and Ben's van which has an aftermarket metal
poptop for the Corvair.  Ben has a website at
http://www.geocities.com/bens_bus/  that also includes links to other
Corvair sites.  Your friend might also want to check out Clark's Corvair
Parts at www.corvair.com . Clark has made quite a name for himself
turning his hobby into a very successful niche business selling parts
for these relatively obscure vehicles that were killed by Ralph Nader's
proclamation that they were "unsafe at any speed."  In fact, I used him
as an example when, many years ago, I had to convince my wife that I
wasn't completely off my rocker quitting my "day job" to turn my Bus
hobby into the Bus Depot.
