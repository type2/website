Subject: RE: [VB] Bay-window gas tank into a splitty

Speaking of gas tanks, I just got a deal on brand new Splitty gas tanks
from a distributor who is going to stop selling them.

For a short time, they are $59.

Unfortunately, Bay window ones are no longer available new, so you'd
need to find a clean junkyard one if you went that route. (Caution: they
rust inside, so make sure you check it carefully before buying it.)
