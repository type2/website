No, it's not.

A Bus and Bug tranny of the appropriate years look exactly the same, have
the same shift coupler connections, swing-axle connections, bell housing,
input shaft, etc.  Stick the Bug tranny in your Bus and you'll only go
fast backwards.

Remember, back in the day, VW wasn't "upmarket" in the US like they are
now.  They were trying to save money, and if they could have changed
over from generator to alternator while still keeping the same regulator,
I'm pretty sure they would have done it.
