I hadn't heard about the dizzy hole, guess I better get Jerry to look at that
when I take the case back in to have it washed. The cam alignment was checked
when the crank align bore was done so my case, 4141, is OK for that. I am
going to have the cam plug hole groove flycut slightly to allow a good seal
with my "O" ring billet cam plug. The narrow "V" groove is even too narrow for
the factory steel plugs.

one i hadn't heard: the bottom of the dizzy drive bore was pinching
the shaft, and that had to be shaved out. at least mine didn't have
that problem.

also, he repeated what many of us aluminum case buyers had suspected
(and some folks claimed was IMPOSSIBLE): some of the cases (some
standard as41 ones, too) had cocked cam or crank bores. steve
described the neat effect that had on cam gears!!
