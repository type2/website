Subject: Re: [VB] 6 volt Speedo and fuel gauge/ 12 V conversion

the speedo is mechanical, not electrical.   You do not need to replace your 
OEM 6V speedo cable with a repro or NOS 12V speedo cable.  You do need to 
change ALLL the lightbulbs in the bus, including the little ones in the speedo, gas 
guage.   dome lights two , as 6V 5W ones will melt the plastic covers.  get 
12V 5W ones.   nur fur 5W.   

They says the 6V gas guages work on 12V

You can send me all your 6V stuff, thanks!  especially if you have a 6V oil 
pressure guage.

Hey all- I just had a quick question-
I'm converting my 66 standard project to 12 volt. Will I need to find a set 
of 12 volt gauges? Or will mine work with a 12 to 6 voltage drop on them? I 
am somewhat attached to the gauges that are in there because they both work 
and are all original.
thanks in advance--- (see what blind faith I have in this list!!) :)
