Hi All-

A couple of dumb questions whilst I try and futz with my brakes on my 65 bus.

1. How do you get those dang dust caps off the front brakes. The manual shows 
a "tool of local manufacture" which I do not posses so a pragmatic (read 
simple) solution would be helpful.
........................
if your bus has the 64-67 dust caps with teh convient lip you use a claw 
hammer.

if you have the 63 and earlier version, which are trickier as they are 
lipless,  you use two hammers.   place the claw kind of towards you on the dust cap 
close to the drum, and hit the peen with another hammer.   tap a couple times, 
then shift the deal to the other side.   this hits the dust cap sort of away 
from the drum, and works for me. I hope this description makes sense.

2. How do I get those 46 mm nuts off the read brakes? I pulled the cotter pin 
but there seems to be no simple way to prevent the drum from spinning and 
with the engine out of the bus the weight is so light in the back of the bus that 
the tire just spins.

Pull the ebrake!   if the ebrake if not holding it, get a friend to step on 
the brake while you undo the nut.
