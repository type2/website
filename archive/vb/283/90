You can see if it's totally open circuit with an ohm-meter.  Measure
from terminal 15 to terminal 4 (the big one) - you should get
something like a few thousand ohms.  Measure from terminal 15 to
terminal 1 - you should get around one ohm.

You can also check for shorts.  Measure from a bare spot on the outer
metal casing to all 3 terminals in turn.  You should have open circuit
(infinite ohms) on all 3.

On a sample Bosch TE6B4 6 V coil I have, I get...

15-1     1.2 ohms
15-4     6480 ohms
case-15  open
case-4   open
case-1   open

A coil can pass these tests and still not fire a plug, but if it fails
any of these tests you can be pretty sure it's bad.

If you've got two similar 6 V coils, and a 12 V battery, you can use one
coil as a dropping resistor for the other one.  Wire the + side of the
battery to terminal 15 on coil 1.  Wire terminal 1 on coil 1 to terminal
15 on coil 2.  Wire terminal 1 on coil 2 to battery ground.  Put a spark
plug wire on terminal 4 of coil 2 and hold the other end about 10 mm from
terminal 1 of coil 2.  Quickly connect and disconnect the wire to the +
side of the battery, and you should get sparks at the end of the spark
plug wire.  Oh yeah, stay away from terminal 4 of coil 1, it wants to
spark too.
