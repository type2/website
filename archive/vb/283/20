Never done it, but I'd suggest that if the bumpers are nice enough to
make shipping them to Europe economical, you probably want to build
a crate for them.  2x4s and 1/2" plywood would make a kick-ass crate;
1x3s and 1/4" plywood would probably work.  Or at least, put them in
a box with packing material, then put that box inside a bigger box
with more packing material.

I have no idea on who to use, but I'd start with the "usual suspects"
of USPS, FedEx, etc.  FedEx, in particular, handles a lot more stuff
lately, and their site is pretty good about steering you to the right
service and giving you a quote.  Things will probably be a bit cheaper
on both ends if the package can be dropped off (by you) and picked up
(by the buyer) at a freight depot/warehouse.
