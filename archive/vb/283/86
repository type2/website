Hi All-

A couple of dumb questions whilst I try and futz with my brakes on my 65 bus.

1. How do you get those dang dust caps off the front brakes. The manual shows a "tool of local manufacture" which I do not posses so a pragmatic (read simple) solution would be helpful.

2. How do I get those 46 mm nuts off the read brakes? I pulled the cotter pin but there seems to be no simple way to prevent the drum from spinning and with the engine out of the bus the weight is so light in the back of the bus that the tire just spins.

Please p-mail as I am not actively reading the list..

Gracias!

michael
