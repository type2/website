Subject: Bit of a find

While my wife & I were on my way home from Melbourne,
Australia, I got these pics of this bus we found in a
wreckers by the side of the freeway.
I'm not sure what year it is.
I couldn't find a compliance plate and I couldn't get
into the engine bay either to get a chassis number.
But it does have factory safaris and the cooling vents
are louvered out, not recessed like standard buses.
It resembles Aussie buses in the way the vents are but
they're on the bottom quarter panel, not mounted
highup like on my Aussie panel so this ones a bit of a
mystery.
It also has the narrow rear door which I thought was
pre-64 but it has the newer indicators on the front.
Any ideas?

I'm stumped.
The sad thing is it is heading for the crusher in 2
weeks.
Should I grab it?
I'm not real inspired as it seems like a bit of a dead
loss per its condition plus it's sitting between 2
very swampy sections of ground.
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
