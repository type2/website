Subject: Re: [VB] Alternator question

some of the alternators have internal regulators.  these have the normal two connections on the alternator, one to the gen light on the dash, one to the big red wire that connects to the  +  of the battery (sometimes via the starter).  You can leave the old regulator in place, use a OEM VW double spade connection to hook up the green wire, and plug the big red wire from the big spade on the regulator to the generator.

some, like the ones from 73 bugs, have extenal regulators and I think those have three connections and the regulators are different.
