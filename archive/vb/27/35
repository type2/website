Yes, that's an after market sump. I have never had an extra sump, but =
would expect that you'd use the same dip stick as a stock 1600. The oil =
pickup tube should extend to the bottom of the sump. The idea is to =
increase amount of oil and surface area for cooling.  A '71 dipstick =
should be the same as a '66. Don't have a measurement here, sorry.=20

Hey All,
Look at this photo please and tell me if I have one of those after market =
Deep Oil Sumps on the bottom of the 1600 engine on my '66.  Whenever I do =
an oil change, I put in the 2.5 quarts of oil and it always reads low on =
the dipstick. I have always assumed that it was just the wrong dipstick =
because the engine is a replacement from a '71. The I recently saw a 1500 =
engine and a 40 HP engine that looked very different on the bottom and it =
caused me to think (a very dangerous thing!) And if it IS one of these =
things, how much oils should bo into the 1600? Anway, here's the link  =

Any advice is appreciated.
Thanks & PEACE, John Baker
