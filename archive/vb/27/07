Subject: Carb woes / flat spot and over heating continued

Beast: 69 camper

Symptom: dreadfully bad flat spot at low rpm. I thought was due to 009 but
as bad if not worse with vac advance dizzy. Rebuilt carb made it worse yet
and today at idle, parked, when I stomp the gas is the thing nearly dies. I
have to pump the petal to keep it running. Is fine at higher rpm. Ran great
in this 60 degree weather going down hill!  :-(

Any ideas?

Tomorrows job: new cooler, all new intake gaskets, install stock exhaust,
torque heads, and try to figure what is up with that carb problem. Wish me
luck!
