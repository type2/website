Subject: bent gas pedal????

Hi All,

When I got my 59 dc I noticed early on that the gas pedal had a kink in it
of about 20 degrees... it matches the bend up in the floor board.   I
finally pushed the pin out last night to put in a straight one that I picked
up and when I started to inspect the bent one, I noticed that the bend looks
too good... i.e. if it had been bent by some PO, the sides of the pedal
would not be straight... the sides of mine look like a very nice stamping...
like it was meant to be.

Any thoughts?  I can post a picture if necessary.
