Hi Taylor,
Never lug it below 1,500 RPM especially in the upper three forward gears or 
it will beat the main bearing to death.  If you have to over rev it over 
3,000 RPM for a few minutes, but in the long run especially in 70F+ weather 
it would be best to just go a little slower in third gear.   Eric&Barb
