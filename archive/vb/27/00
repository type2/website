Hi John,
Probably best to take it down to a longblock and retorque the head and case 
fasteners.  Doing this will mean you can get a good inspection of alot of the 
engine, it's tin and other parts.  We just did this with a motor Eric's 
sister bougt with a 1969 Canadian camper conversion.  Turned out the head 
fins were clogged up over halfway with casting flash which we were able to 
cut out with a circular hand saw and used carbide blade in ten minutes.  Plus 
there was no sealing foam over the doghouse cooler!
   Once you get it all back together drive it in town for the first 300-500, 
and do not drive it over 30 minutes at a time.  Keep changing oil at least 
every 50 miles, till the oil stops turning black so soon.   This all will 
allow the engine to polish all the corroded surfaces and not get to temps so 
high that and oil sludge will come loose and clog up the oil cooler or 
bearing/s.   Eric&Barb
