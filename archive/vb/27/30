 Someone recently asked about stereo installation so I thought I would reveal
 how I did it in my 63. I started off getting an under dash Pioneer Super
 tuner 8-track tape player. You remember the ones with the big round dial.
 Anyway their was one small hole in my tray along the passenger side. Not
 knowing what the hole was for and not wanting to drill any more holes. I
 decided to bolt the under dash bracket down with only one bolt. This was
 fine because the lip of the tray kept it from moving.
 The novelty of the 8-track was pretty cool for a while, hell I even went so
 far as finding a guy that still could record to 8-track and had him make me
 up some tapes. Though about 9 months later the tape player quit working and
 within another week or two the radio faded out. >>

I have one of those Pinoeer supertuner 8 track players in my 61.  Good sound, 
I think so at least.   Have been told by different people it was the top of 
the line car 8 track player.    Mine still works nice, aint gutting it.

I do have a couple 8 track players for car that I dont know if they work, 
though
