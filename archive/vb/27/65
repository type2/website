Subject: Re: [VB] 68 Puck...  plus

I give strong support and muy credit to Everett Barnes
<everettb(-at-)thesamba.com> for creating and maintaining
the "VW Planet" website. The volume of items for sale
is a testament to it's popularity. If Mr. Barnes got
one dollar for everything that sold on his site I fear
that it would soon become "Brand new Mercedes
Planet.com" instead of it's current name. =)

Will try and pmail more info about trailer/caravan
links as time permits to interested parties.
I can provide more info on Pucks at that time.

Most teardrop trailer will/may be heavier than this
particular Puck. Literature shows 660 lbs and 75lbs
tongue wt. for my Puck. I have had great success
pulling this trailer with my 67 bus with a 1776 and
dual carbs. Yes, have seen a "splittie" tow an
Airstream. Wait for Kyle Tillman's response... =)
I encourage and support of all trailers and their
owners.
