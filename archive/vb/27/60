Subject: Gainesville Florida to Kokomo Indiana

Well, a long needed trip back to Indiana may finally be happening. I've not 
been home since '96 when my dad passed away, so its time for me to maybe 
face reality. Im going home to move a dune buggy I bought in the NW part of 
IN to safer confines and out of the weather. The main reason for going home 
is to pick up one of my Studebakers and bring it back to Florida.

I usually take I75 to I24 to I65, but I might take a different route this 
time. Maybe go over and hit I65 in Alabama and take it all the way north. 
Two reasons for writing this note is to see if anyone is along that route 
(yes, I belong to AIRS) and if there is anyone needing something taken 
north, I will have an empty car trailer behind me.

So drop me a note for either of those reasons. We HOPE to be going the 
second week in Oct. If anyone is in Indiana and has a VW or dune buggy for 
sale, let me know.

Thanks,
David
