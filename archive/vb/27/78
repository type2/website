Adrian, a year ago I had a chance to see how well a splitty with a stock
engine will pull.  I sold Dawn and Richard a 21 window and they pulled it
from Kansas to Arizona behind "Rusty Bus" with a stock and tired 1600.
Rusty bus was also fully loaded.  They stopped at the busses and ballons
rally on the way.  Richard told me it didn't even really changed the gas
milege, but they did take it a bit slower.

Then at the first of this summer, coming back from the Classic, Dawn's bus
had a problem, so I towed her bus behind my '76 westy and Richard towed my
1300 pound Scamp http://www.scamptrailers.com/  behind Rusty Bus.  We had
to go about 200 miles up hill to Flagstaff then down the mountain to
Cottonwood.  Richard told me he couldn't even tell the Scamp was behind
him!!

If you put a type 4 upright in a splitty, you won't have any problem
towing, but it would be a good idea to have brakes on whatever you are
towing if it weighs over 1500 pounds.  And be sure to put a GOOD hitch on
your bus, one that doesn't attach to the bumper.
