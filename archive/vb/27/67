  To each his own, but I honestly don't see any 
advantage and several drawbacks to using a deep sump. 
Additional cooling would be negligble, just more time to 
reach operating temps and to cool down.  
  Does it run hot? I noticed from the picture that your 
barrels are missing the cool tin air deflectors!...maybe 
the dpo was trying to solve overheating problems by 
adding the sump he saw in the kewl, sano rags. 
  Kinda of like cutting your head off to get rid of a 
headache! Don't treat the symptom, fix the problem.
