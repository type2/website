I thought the "air deflectors" (pieces of tin that are
secured to the bottom of the cylinders) where found on
Type3's orginally and had to be added to the other
types. If that tin is original he never had it to
begin with. The picture is bad but i do see the lower
tin that attaches to the case and heater box.

At less than $2 a quart, and purchase price of about
$30 for the sump i would say cost is minimal.

Blame the mechanic not the sump.

Possible but not very likely unless you lower your
car, and why would you do that anyway. :)

I have never heard of that before. It is possible but
it sounds like a poor assembly job to me. Key word

I run a stock 1600 in my bus with a full flow system
and heavy duty oil pump. It's a system that has never
let me down. 
By the way if anyone needs a sump i can be reached at
www. iLOVEVWsumps.com, just kidding. I just think they
are worth the money.
