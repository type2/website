Subject: Church Keys On Airplanes

Last year when Erin and I flew in to Vegas to attend the Lake Havasu show I
dumped my pocket stuff on the little tray at the X-ray machine and the
ladies there asked about the church key on my key ring.  I told her that it
was to open the gas tank filler on a old split window bus.  She went and got
her supervisor and she asked me what it was for.  I explained to her and she
thought about it for a minute and then let me pass.  With the heightened
security I doubt if a church key is the kind of thing that you want to have
in your pocket.
Just a heads up to let you know.
