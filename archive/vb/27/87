When i let out my clutch and the bus begins to move
forward i get a loud and solid clunk from the rear. I
also experience  my shifter moving as i let off the
gas. Here is a list of what i have done so far:
All new mounts (bell housing and nose cone)
Checked bolts at redux box to spring plate
new shift coupler
new clutch(heavy duty)
new pressure plate (200mm)
Checked all lug nuts
checked the rear axle nuts
I am going to yank it out tonight to replace the Gland
nut and polish up the shaft.
Short of buying a new tranny, are there any other
ideas?
Thanks,
Sean
