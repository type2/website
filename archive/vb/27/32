which piece of cooling tin?   Some are the same , some not.  The rear most 
piece- the one the fresh air tubes (on fresh air motors) go through is 
different for 40hp to 1600.

The exhuast is also different.  You can get cheap NOS 40hp bus mufflers.  
Seen them for $25 at swaps.  Who uses them- low demand, leftovers parts- your 
gain.

If you have a stepped crank you must use a stepped crank flywheel.   You can 
used a stepped FW on your later crank, but if you use an O ring FW on your 
early crank it will leak.  Is what I am told.   You can tell what kind when 
you remove the FW, is there a step on the crank?  on the FW?  or an o ring 
space in the FW?

Why swap FWs?  for the bigger clutch?  It is possible to find the large 
clutch stepped FWs.  for 12V?   put a 12V solenoid on the 6V starter if you 
have 6V FW teeth in a 12V bus and can't find a stepped 12V FW.
