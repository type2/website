Well, I got the tires to put on my rims, and the tire guy said that they
probably wouldn't work.
The tires on the rims now, OG I think, are 5.6x15 low profile. Anyone think
I am going to have problems with using these rims with 205R7015 tires to
trailer a bus?
TIA

Quick question:
I am getting 205/70R15 from a tire place to put on my '67 deluxe just to
move it from point A to point B to do more work. This should work, right?
I will probably trailer it, so it really shouldn't matter, right?
The first 10 respondants will earn my enduring respect and thanks!
