 regarding the theft deterrent end of the discussion.  Prior to my fire I had 
 the vintage 8-track fm receiver in the dash(69) and my pioneer am/fm/cass/cd 
 controller in the glove box with the six disc changer mounted in under the 
 sink in back.  I figure stealth is the best deterrent since they love to
