I had a deep sump on my beetle but I took it off b/c my car was too low.
(That's another story)  Anyway...I also had an after market chrome dip stick
and when I first filled up the engine with oil I used a stock dip stick to
set the level. The lever should be the same with or without the deep sump.
Once it was full, I then put my chrome dipstick in and made a mark on it to
show me where stock full was.  While running the deep sump it usually took
about 1.5 liters extra.  Hope that helps.

Yes, that's an after market sump. I have never had an extra sump, but would
expect that you'd use the same dip stick as a stock 1600. The oil pickup
tube should extend to the bottom of the sump. The idea is to increase amount
of oil and surface area for cooling.  A '71 dipstick should be the same as a
'66. Don't have a measurement here, sorry.

Hey All,
Look at this photo please and tell me if I have one of those after market
Deep Oil Sumps on the bottom of the 1600 engine on my '66.  Whenever I do an
oil change, I put in the 2.5 quarts of oil and it always reads low on the
dipstick. I have always assumed that it was just the wrong dipstick because
the engine is a replacement from a '71. The I recently saw a 1500 engine and
a 40 HP engine that looked very different on the bottom and it caused me to
think (a very dangerous thing!) And if it IS one of these things, how much
oils should bo into the 1600? Anway, here's the link

Any advice is appreciated.
Thanks & PEACE, John Baker
