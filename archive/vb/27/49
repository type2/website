Subject: Re: [VB] bent gas pedal????

Hi David,
It is definitely DPO bent in that direction there will be no resultant bowing 
of the sides.  Often we see a simular modification where the DPOs have bent 
up the stop on the forward tip end of the pedal to allow more downward 
movement to get more linkage/cable pull on the carb arm.  Even after complete 
going through repairing/fixing all the type 2 accelerator linkages on our 
running buses we found with our 1960 panel camper and 1963 SC that we needed 
to cut and weld a 1/4" longer the linkage rod that attaches to the pedal to 
get full carb response.   Eric&Barb
