Sounds like the low and mid range curcuit in your carb has restrictions.
Not always will a simple carb rebuilding take out restrictions.  In the
past, I have had to remove soft plugs on the carb where they drilled the
passages, clean the passages out then reinstall the plugs.

You might also check your timing, it may be a bit slow.
