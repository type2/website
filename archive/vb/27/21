I have the Sears sets of double-box-end flat-ratchet wrenches in both
English and metric, and I like 'em.  They don't require as much axial
clearance as a socket and ratchet so they can be useful in places like
the fuel pump and carb nuts.  They require about the same radial
clearance (or a little more) than a socket, so in places with really
tight fits (cheap mufflers) they may not work so good.  One non-VW thing
they're really good at is cinching nuts down on long bolts or studs -
they work even after my deep sockets have given up.

The sets I have are 5 wrenches each, and I think you can get them
for $20 - $25 or so when on sale.  They are 9-42170, 7x8, 9x10, 12x13,
14x15, 19x21 and 9-42160, 1/4x5/16, 3/8x7/16, 1/2x9/16, 5/8x3/4,
11/16x7/8 .
