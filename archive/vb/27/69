I ran one on my '56, and on my '60 until recently.  The 
bus didn't run any cooler, but I liked spreading the 'wear'
over more oil.  I don't think the amount of time it takes
to heat the extra oil is significant.  If it was, then why not
reduce the case sump capacity to 1qt?

The only reason I'm not running one on the '60 DD is that
it won't fit with the westy hitch.
