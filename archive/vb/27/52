Matt,
Nah, not the dogbone style. Go to www.sears.com and search on Item #0094200500
They look like a standard end wrench but the box side has a ratchet with a 
tiny direction lever. Supposed to be a 5 degree ratchet, handy in tight 
spaces. First time I've seen 'em.  Guaranteed for life, so if they get dirt 
in the mech, back they go.
I stopped by the Sears store today, they had sets on the pegs with 18, 16, 
14, 13, 12, 10 and maybe 8mm for about $100. Useless as a set to us. The 
Craftsman club flyer had $28 off but didn't list the sizes. The item number 
above looks like the best deal for VW owners. I tried to order online but 
Thom and Ev aren't working for 'em so their acct signup fails with a "null" 
error code.
Stupid computers, we shouldn't use 'em until they're perfected.
