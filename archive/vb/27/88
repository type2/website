Put the back end of the car in the air, and spin one
wheel and see how much rotation it takes until the other
one turns.  It shouldn't be much - maybe 1/8" turn?

How much does the shifter move when you let off the gas?
1/8"?  1/4"?  3"?

Excessive wear in the hockey stick & nose cone?  Cracked
nose cone?
