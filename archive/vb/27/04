Hi Les,
Good points!  We have thought since we were are staying with the swing axle 
tranny of doing up a 1800cc type 4 engine converted to upright and a 3.44 R&P 
freeway flier.  That way we would have the extra torque of the 1800 the 
bigger, wider main bearings and other improvements that made the type 4 a 
200,000 and often 300,000 lifespan between rebuilds if maintained properly 
and not overheated in the much heavier late 70s bus.  But not so much as a 
2000 type 4 that it is so easy to pop the tranny so hard the swing axles 
actually throw the bus body up into the air and when it comes down the 
turning/spinning rear tires lock onto the pavement again and snap the stock 
tranny case in half!  A local friend of our's did that a few years ago.
