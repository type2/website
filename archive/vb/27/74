Subject: Re: [VB] 68 Puck...  plus

Wow, really?  No one has ever complained before, please email me with your
issues.  In fact, I get 2-5 emails/day stating the opposite experience.

I went to the Search page of the Classifieds:
http://www.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/classifieds.mv?search
and typed in "Puck" (no quotes) and Jim's ad came right up as the first
entry of 8 ads with "Puck" in them.

Jim writ:
"'68 Eriba Puck $4500. see VWPlanet ad"

Is it me or is VWPlanet impossible to navigate and the search does not work.
Too fancy for its own good...  I have no idea who runs this site, so please
take it as constructive criticism.  Is there a detailed explanation on how
to view information about the Puck...  For the simple minded people like
myself :)
