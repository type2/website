Subject: Re: [VB] Church Keys On Airplanes

I was stopped in Tampa.  Was in a rush w/ an impact wrench in my bag (long 
story don't ask).  Well they stopped me had me open my bag had a look at it, 
called the supervisor who knew what it was and sent me on my way, with my 
Gerber multi tool in the other bag.
