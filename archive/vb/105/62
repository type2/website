Didnt know that. Gene Berg was THE god of Modifying VW engines and he really
knew what he was talking about.

You're one of the first people in years that has discussed aluminum pushrod
expansion. I remember back in the late 70's early 80's that Gene talked a
lot about that and even advocated chrome molly pushrods on high power
engines, but felt that the growth potential in aluminum rods was negated by
the fact that it was pounded at both ends preventing any lengthening for any
duration long enough to change your geometry significantly. He felt that the
growth was not measureable and thus any engine under 70 hp and 5500 RPM
wouldn't notice a change and a factory gap would suffice.

the gap should be .006 on intake and exhaust with stock aluminum pushrods,
but also if you have steel pushrods it should be about .002 to .003. intake
and exhaust. And of course always set them with the engine cold. The reason
for the larger gap with aluminum rods is for the larger expansion from them
when they heat up.
