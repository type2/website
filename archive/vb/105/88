When I lived in north carolina I was a constant target for the local police.
Many searches, most completely illegal. I even had park ranger open my
vehicle while I was in a park AWAY from my bus. She dug out my stash threw
it in the floor  and waited for me to get back and said they had the right
to search the vehicle based on the  little baggy laying in plain sight in
the floor.   Since moving to eugene/springfield oregon its been easy. Tons
of buses, and a few stickers pale in comparison to some of the rolling art
you see around here.

Happy Friday everyone!

 I'm doing a little survey, a bit of research you could say.  I have been
all over the country, but I have only had the pleasure of driving a bus on
the east coast, and the west.  Mass, and Cal. to be exact.  In California, I
had a 67 deluxe, and I had a 71 westie.  Driving a vintage VW is a lot more
common out there.  Very rarely was I ever pulled over by police, in fact,
never. And I lived out there for a while.  When I grew up, I lived in Mass,
and it seemed that just being in a VW bus put you at risk of being pulled
over, and hassled.  And a deadhead sticker on it, then you are really asking
for trouble!!!
I'm wondering if it is a problem everyone faces, or does it vary state, to
state?  If the bus is mint, is it different?  Answers, comments, and stories
appreciated!!  :)
