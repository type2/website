       The trouble with nibblers is they can't nibble around sharp curves 
without breaking the foot. (I only had to do it once!).  They are fantastic 
on flat panels and very fast.  For rough cutting I use an air chisel, this is 
the only way to go for cutting out large dented areas.  It's also great for 
just getting the panel out of your way to see what you have to deal it 
structure wise.  If the way is clear and you can see what your dealing with 
you can use the Saw-all to clean up the cut.  If the panels flat you can now 
nibble away at it, dress you cut with a grinder.  If there are curves, you 
better off with a wheelie cutter.  
       Remember all the safety stuff, cover up those pretty eyes and wear 
gloves!!
                                                                              
      Peace,
