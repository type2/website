If you have an early '64 (made before 1 222 025, December 1963),
then yes.  It's the part made out of two pieces of stamped sheet
metal, with a pivot in the middle.  Per the parts manual, this part
(261 827 361) was used post-Barndoor till December 1963.  Barndoors
used 211 827 361 and really, really early Barndoors (before November
1950) used 111 823 315 .

>I've seen the later big spring type (on the '67)

This was used starting in December 1963 and continuing to the bay
windows.  211 827 401.

Dropping the rear window over the engine lid to hold it?  This
works OK until you rock the Bus or the breeze blows and sends
the rear window skyward...
