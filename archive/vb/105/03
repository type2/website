Subject: swing lever bushing dimensions

Hello everyone,

I'm at work, and I've got a machinist buddy that can make me a replacement 
swing lever bushing to replace the one that I screwed up last night.  Is 
there anyone out there that could give me the measurements (I.D., O.D., 
Length) for a swing lever bushing before it's pressed in the beam.  If I can 
get it within the next coupla hours, I can get it made and get it in 
tonight.  I can also borrow an adjustable reamer out here, and I can clean 
up one of the swing lever pins I've got, so I can finish the job tonight.  
Just to make sure, the final diameter of the bushing AFTER reaming should be 
0.950", correct ?(got that from the vintagebus how to section, thanks Thom)

Mike A.
