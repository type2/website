Subject: where does my spare go?

hey everyone-
on my 65 westy so-42, there seems to be no place ot put the spare tire! there 
is no well above the engine compartment, nor behind the front bench seat, 
wich was never cut. there are bolts to mount it on the front of the busd, but 
ive never heard of those coming from the factory or dealer installed. anybody 
got any ideas???
also, does anybody know if westfalia ever did paint jobs?
