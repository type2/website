Subject: Re: [VB] where does my spare go?

with a  1/3 2/3 front seat   65 tilt the pass seat forward and look between 
it and the metal bulkhead- that's where they put them for bench seats.  If 
your bulkhead was cut, or if there is a gas heater in the spare tire well, oh 
well.

now all the junk you left on the seat fell on the floor. v :)
