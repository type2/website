There is a shop in Phoenix where I had my Canopy made for my 1960DC  The
cost was Under $480, Apache Awning, on East Van Buren-- and it is The Best
Material that you can have  "Sumbrella"? Plus is waterproofed--This material
is used to cover boats or whatever All Year Round in Arizona-- I am very
pleased with it--
"Rudy" will be at the Phoenix Bug-a-Rama if you want to inspect--or check
out my web site for pics of "Rudy"--TWWM, uj
