The tools book at http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/tools.html
has drawings for some of the tools you mentioned.  VW 609 is the jack
cradle.  VW 643 is an assembly stand that can hold the engine or the
transaxle; they don't show a picture of it with the transaxle but it
looks like the outrigger arms bolt to the lug nuts on the drums.

Some things I haven't tried, but that sound reasonable to me
(possibly because I've never dropped a transaxle on my toe):

You might be able to fake the jack cradle if you have a jack that
fits under a transmission pretty well.  Or, put a big wood block in
the jack cradle and carve it with slots to match the ribs on the
transmission.  To keep the axle tubes from flopping around, use a
board on top of the transmisson and some U-bolts on the axle tubes:

     _+_____________+_       board
      |   ._____.   |<-----  U-bolts
      |   |     |   |
======|===(trans)===|======  axle tubes
          |_____|

You might even be able to get away with tying a rope around one axle
tube, running it over the trans, and tying it to the other axle tube
to hold the tubes level.  Or, use two pieces of rope, and tie each
axle tube to one of the bellhousing bolt holes.

I wonder if it would be helpful to take a normal floor jack and put
big knobby pneumatic tires on it, for "VW parts in barn" and "crusty
VW found in field" duty.
