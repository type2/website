Subject: so we got in the red vw microbus,

Well I drive the SnoopyBus (painted up like the Partridge Family's bus)
http://quicksitemaker.com/members/snoop/SnoopyBus.html for those that
haven't seen it.  I live in SC.  I have driven North to Va, West to Mo from
there South to La then East to the coast.  Of all those states I have not
been pulled over (Knocking on wood)  I have been hassled but always when I
was parked.  But you always need to be ready.. If you are carrying anything
that you might not want the cops to find.  A bus is not probably not the
best vehicle to be driving.  As my luck could change in a heartbeat.  Yours
could also.  I do not usually carry anything in my bus that could risk me
getting to my desired location for that reason.

YMMV

See y'all at EveryBus...

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
