Subject: Safari Windows Rule!!!

Today I got off work early. I had a dentist appointment at lunch and 
ended up having to have an emergency tooth pulling....which I guess 
helps to perpetuate the myth that all Texans are toothless 
hicks..right!?!?

Driving home down the highway in my '59 Kombi. Sun shining bright, 
clear sky, nice cool breeze.....and the VICODIN just starting to kick 
in...I think to myself,

" Man, safari windows rule!".

Sweet.
