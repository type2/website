<< ust looking for some advice, or things to watch out for as I try to swap 
my running 1600dp from my 71 into the '65 so I can try it out, and maybe even 
register it.  I pulled a barely running 1600 dp type3 engine out of the 65, 
and so far the only difference I notice is the clutch throw-out.

ya- if the clutch throw out in the 71 is the kind with the clucth with the 
fingers and no flat circle thing (very technical term) then swap the clutch 
from the 65 onto it new motor (assuming Fw and all are compatible).  Other 
wise you will fry the TO bearing because of those fingers and also hear 
unpleasant noises from back there.    And put in new FW seal/ O ring and 
cooler seals, if the motor from the 71 hasn't had them in a couple years.

 I suppose I can just pop the one off the 71 and put it in the 65 too.  I've 
the pulled the motor on the 71 many times, but this will be my first swap.  
The 65 was already converted to 12 volt, so I think I'm ok there too.  Also, 
the 71 motor has the beetle exhaust with the two short tailpipes on it.

best to get a bus muffler on there.  if the apron hasn't been cut out and 
bumper (if aplicable ) they will get in the way, and the exhaust flow can get 
sucked back into the bus.

Check out suggestions for the other guy who posted he's pulling his motor for 
other things to think about (new fuel lines, engine compartment seals, axle 
boots, fresh gear oil, etc)
 

happy camping
