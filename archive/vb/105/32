Subject: Re: [VB] where does my spare go?

Interesting, as flip seats were made out of walk through busses...or so
I've always been told.  Maybe they did'nt have anymore walk throughs left
to make flip seats out of and used some bench models???  Just guessing.

Speaking of flip seats, did that one at Red Barn sell??  The guy was asking
5500.  The roof had been worked and it needed rockers and front window
channel repair.  Mostly complete though.  I'm no expert on the flips so I'm
sure I missed something.

Had a tent though :-)
