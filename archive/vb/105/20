Subject: Bus Canopies

For the record, I wasn't knocking the canopies Tom is making, and I'm
sure with all the waiting people have been put through they will sell. I
was only pointing out differences from the og canopies that I noticed
while looking at them. I was actually thinking of buying one and putting
my logo, phone number, etc. on it so I could save my original
one................

By all means stay away from the lowered roof height style canopies. If
people want their canopy that tall send them to me and I'll lowered the
whole truck for them to get it there................... 8-)
