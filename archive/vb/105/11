If the fuel line is as old as your truck, it is likely to wear and leak and 
that can cause a fire.  So you need to replace the fuel line from engine to 
motor and from pump to carb with new.   Make sure the fuel line is grommeted 
where it goes through the tin to the left of the fan housing- other wise the 
metal on metal wears through.   Always clamp the lines that are under 
pressure- that is between the pump and carb.   Give enough fuel line for the 
filter to be off to the left of the coil, so if it drips it does not drip on 
wires.   You can also peen the metal inlet/outlets of thepump and carb, as 
they can pop off, or wire them on
