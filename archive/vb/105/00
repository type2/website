Why?   Do you have a welder?   Go and cut up some coat hangers in 2 to 3
in. lengths.  Weld them on to the dent in the appropriate places.  You
might go and buy the specialized puller (basicly a slide hammer with a
special head) to make it easier.   You can also use a claw hammer or any
other type of puller.  

That said, the stud welder is a bit neater and the welds are smaller to
grind off.
