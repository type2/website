Shawn,
       The stud welder gun is an invaluable tool!  I use it on EVERY project 
I have ever done.  I have done tons of metal and body work and wouldn't even 
consider doing it without one.  The pins grind off real easy and keep the 
heat down, which warps panels fast.  And the shrinking tip is invaluable, 
especially for someone new to shrinking.  Stay away from the torch till you 
feel like a pro!  I think it is a tool every metal working soul should have.  
You can get metal sooo much closer with this tool.  I would buy the full kit 
though, about $500..  Money spent on tools, is never a waste of money.
