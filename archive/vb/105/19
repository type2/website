Tonight I repacked my wheel bearings in both front wheels and replaced =
both seals, the drivers side seal took a couple of taps to get fully =
seated, but the passenger slid right in, and I can actually move it =
around like a clock.   This doesn't seem right, the wheels look the =
same, the old seals appear to be the same side for each wheel. Q: Do I =
maybe have an odd wheel that requires a different seal, and if so, how =
do I find out what I've Got?=20

Thanks=20
