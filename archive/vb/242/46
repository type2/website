Subject: Ceramics Business finally wired in ......... read to work.

I'm up and running ........... at last.
First electrician wanted $3800.00 for the necessary work, I finally got
the whole thing wired for $1050.00.
Kicked off the oven tonight and everything works good.
Please let me know if you're needing the Ceramics Application and fill me
in on the details.

I'm going to try to pass some discounts on to list members. 
Since I'm new to some phases of this business I'm not sure how much I can
give up and still be friendly ........... but I'm working on it.
