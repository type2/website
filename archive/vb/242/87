Subject: Re: [VB] RE: Speedo broke ?

As an afterthought on a  broken speedo fix.... I realize that not everyone
will have this equipment, but as a hiker and geocacher
(http://www.geocaching.com) I use one regularly.  Most GPS receivers have a
speed function.  I use it quite often to check my speedos in all my cars.
Just a thought.
