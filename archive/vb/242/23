Good!

That is it!  According to our microfische literature it is a one way valve.  
You also need to pick up a metal fuel line (Check Wolfsburg West for a new 
metal engine compartment fuel line.) that goes from the fuel pump around the 
left side of the engine and must have a hard rubber grommet as it goes 
through the front engine tin.  No grommet, then used a section of flex fuel 
line slit down the side and hose clamped in place to keep the metal fuel line 
from being sawed through by the tin hole edge!  On the left side of the fan 
shroud should be a bracket to hold the metal fuel line from vibrating and 
rubbing on the left heat riser.

We would be interested in seeing an image of the air cleaner in place!

No problem!  That was a nice trick we learned from an old VW shop mechanic 
now long gone in Kirkland WA...
