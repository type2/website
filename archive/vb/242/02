   well, i should clarify - for those who haven't eagerly opened EACH 
of my mails ;)
this is the SECOND aluminum case - the first had one too many nasty 
surprises and back it went... last straw was vomting sand into my 
bearings on startup.

which is a good question... like i said, the guy at NWCR sounded 
surprised at the barrel shape; perhaps he had been assuming a 
consistently narrow bore, and this was an unsuspected flaw. raymond, 
why don't you quiz jerry on this next time you are out there?
