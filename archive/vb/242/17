Subject: Noisy TO bearing saga continues

Well, I've about decided that checking/replacing the cross-shaft and bushings is about the only thing I haven't tried.  My assumption was that a 
Rancho rebuilt tranny would have had all that stuff checked out - but maybe not.

IF I can figure out how to get the right-hand cross-shaft bush out I'll replace the whole schmeer.  CB Performace sells a new HD cross shaft & bushes 
for about $14.

It's SO freakin' annoying to get this nasty noise every time I use the clutch.  More annoying since this will be engine pull #3 to try to resolve it.
