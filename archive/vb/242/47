Subject: Re: [VB] Westy cot in non westy

That's a good article.
This exactly what I'm doing.
I've already found a 76-79 cot and I just happend
to have 5 split style brackets so I guess I'll be 
doin a little remodel on the camper. Make a little more
room in the master bedroom : )
I'll let yall know how it fit.
