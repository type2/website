Subject: Re:Binz with roof damage

Mine also had some roof damage at the rear but i don't think it was it. But
could have been,,, depends on which side it got hit on , if it was the
passengers side it could have been as mine has taken a hard shot down the
side and kinda concentrated in the rear wheelwell area. Most of the damage
on the rear of my roof is minor golfballed sized dings,(unless i find more
when i start removing paint). The texas sticker was still in the windshield
when i got it, now its on the side glass. later
