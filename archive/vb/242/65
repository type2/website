Funny, with all the threads on the alum. cases, the other day my  engine
builder ordered a new case for me, & was furious when the case arrived & it
was alum. instead of a regular vw case.  I asked him about the alum cases, &
he said they are "a mess".  He also said they run about 15 degrees hotter &
weigh about 15 lbs. more. (is there a 15/15 rule? grin)

Anyone know anything about the hotter/weight scenario?
