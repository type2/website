hey, i resemble that remark!  :)

the only reason i got ANOTHER one is because that is all the 
manufacturer would do - replace in kind, NOT refund. RONNIE offered 
to replace it w/ a new 'official' vw case, but it would've come out 
of his OWN pocket, and i didn't want to do that to him. he's been 
great about listening to me scream in his ear and helping me track 
down answers and replacement parts.
