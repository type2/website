Subject: Re: [VB] AGAIN an aluminum case update

the only reason i got ANOTHER one is because that is all the manufacturer
would do - replace in kind, NOT refund. RONNIE offered  to replace it w/
a new 'official' vw case, but it would've come out 
of his OWN pocket, and i didn't want to do that to him. he's been  great
about listening to me scream in his ear and helping me track down answers
and replacement parts. Craig K

I haven't been keeping my very own archives on this posting.
So who is the official owner of the case that has had all the pictures
and war stories aired ?
Am I wrong in thinking this is the same case that had the casting sand in
the oil galleries?
