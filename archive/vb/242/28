Subject: Re: [VB] AGAIN an aluminum case update

I would be very interested in aircooled.net's
list of known defects of the new aluminum
type 1 cases. There seems to be considerable
confusion regarding this, and the frequency
in which they appear.
My first inquiry  regarding the cases was at
the # 5000 mark, and I was told the only
verified defect was a problem with packaging
and breakage in shipment, and some minor
cleaning issues.
It now appears that some defects have been resolved
only to be replaced by several significant others.
Checking a case for defects is one thing.
( Finding them is quite another :)

Aircooled.net has an interesting sales pitch.
They offer a WARRANTY for $50 to cover defects,
and "will not refund in-house machining options
without it". Evidently, having a case machined by
a trained professional is not enough to guarantee
the case you haven't seen yet does not contain
any known defects. It also does not cover shipping costs.
I assume the warranty is also not refundable when you
discover the obvious defect and use it to secure
the refund, and not purchasing the warranty will guarantee
NO refund of an obviously defective case.
Does this make any sense ?
What is the time limit of this warranty period ?

What are the statistical odds of anyone getting
a defective case WITHOUT your warranty plan ?
What are the statictical odds of anyone getting
TWO defective cases WITH your warranty plan :) ?!
