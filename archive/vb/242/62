Subject: RE: [VB] AGAIN an aluminum case update

   Just wondering if anybody has got one of EMPI's new aluminum cases yet?
Would like to see if their quailty is any better, even though they come from
the same factory only with EMPI molded in the case. Could  be worth 5000
dollars in 20 years with that EMPI name on it 
  Watch out, Dave Mayes has been stashing all these new EMPI HyPro parts so
he can say in 30 years look at all the NOS EMPI speed parts I have <;) save
him from having to search for them.

That's the reason I opted to repair my case. That and the fact that it takes
the attorney general to make things right. No, I'll keep my attorneys fees
and transfer part of them to the block!


You know what they say when you assume something.

If a defect case is returned to us, why in the world would we sell it to
someone else?
That's bad business, and is insulting to be considered someone that would do
something like that.
Let me know if I read it wrong, but that's the impression it gave me.
