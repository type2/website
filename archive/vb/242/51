that would be Dan kinseys. dont know if hes still currently on the list. I talked to him about that before and he doesnt seem to
think that was his.

The thing that always strikes me as odd about that picture... doesnt it look like there are no rear tires? Sure the skinny guy is in
the way, but still youd think you could clearly see at least that outer tire? Do you see it?

What a cool pic.
The search continues....
