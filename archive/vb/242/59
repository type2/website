 Ah maybe I won't then.  This tranny has only done 45k, it sat for about 
13years I believe, then was driven for 3 years, then sat for a few years 
again, before been drained and removed about 18months ago.  So it has been 
drained a while.

If I was you, I'd clean the magnetic drain plugs, fill with clean oil ( oh 
you did that already)

then drive about 500 miles and change the oil.  Then change it again in 
another 500 miles.   I bet it will loosen up some.
