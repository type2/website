No juice.  The starter solenoid may click or clunk but the starter never
turns.  It's caused by high resistance in the starter solenoid circuit;
the solenoid isn't getting enough juice to engage.  Going over your
connections (battery terminals, battery-body ground, transmission-body
ground, fat red wire from starter to front, fat red wire at fuse box,
fat red wire at ignition switch, thin red wire at ignition switch, thin
red wire at starter) can help.
