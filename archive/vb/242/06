LOL! did they have this problem with the vw cases, ie, do the 
magnesium alloy cases see this prob as well?

hmmmmmmmmmmm....... innaresting. offset in which way? the way my 
bearing was pinced had me suspecting that the bearing was cocked in 
the saddle; wonder if the dowels would explain that? could be that 
NWCRod was seeing the symptom, but hadn't found the root cause. 
wouldn't surprise me, as it would just be more of my $$$$$$$$$$ down 
the sh*tter for nothing :)

my talks with rimco and NWCR  had directed my thoughts to a dull web 
cutting tool deforming the case by moving metal rather than REmoving 
it. that would explain why some were bad and others not (fresh tool, 
no probs; gets worse as time goes on).  next person who buys a case 
and gets a pinch, remove the dowels and see for us :)

ronnie, you and i  - and ESPECIALLY - I -  ;)  should not have to be 
doing their r&d and lemon checks for them.
like i said, at the least i want a 'team aip' racing jacket for my 
troubles LOL!!

i totally agree - that is why i haven't given up on these cases. i'm 
interested to see how the extra heatload these things are said to 
carry works in the long run, how long they can go before alignboring, 
how cost-effective it is to weld up holes due to thrown rods vs buy a 
new one etcetcetc.
i would just rather some of the more basic questions - like, does the 
crank fit???? - had been solved definitively before i started MY 
tests!!! lol!
