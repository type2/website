Stan-
The owner of that sad case is selling his spare parts and moving :)

Twas writ-  " If anybody would of had the so called casting sand checked
they would have
seen that is was steel shot and black oxidized aluminum. When the cases were
cast they went into a giant conveyer shot peen machine for cleaning. The
cases come out of the molds BLACK and are then shot blasted to eliminate
this. They overloaded the machines, thus not getting a good cleaning of some
of the cases. This is why the so called casting sand was not in/on every
case in a numbered sequnce."

I saw the photos. It was being called SAND at that time.
Sure looked like sand to me. It didn't seem like the cases had
been shot-peened at all, there was casting flash everywhere.
It was not being called "black oxidized aluminum" nor did it look it.

There's too many discrepancies. We need a list of the, uh, players.

I want to purchase an aluminum type 1 engine case.
I would like one with NO defects.
If the "statistics" say it is possible, I need to know how many
to order so I can get one.:)
If that is not possible, I would like a list of "known" defects
from which to choose:)

Regardless, I would like to expect to receive a refund of any
bus part I may buy which is riddled with manufacturer's defects.
It would then be my choice to spend that money for another one.
And get another refund.

If this new type of marketing is sucessful, it will prevail.
