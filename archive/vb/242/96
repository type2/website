Hi Keith,
Sorry to take so long to get back to you!  Eric had his first week at a new 
machinist job.

Hmm, are those the 195/82R15s?  If so they should be taller.  We were Pmailed 
by a fellow list member (We can not remember this list member's name!  Darned 
lack of memory we both have for names.) awhile back about this size of Cooper 
tire and they apparently were for Range Rover, and since these autos are MUCH 
heavier than a bus they probably would be a really strong tire for our use.

Wieght of the tire really should not matter to the bus, unless you are trying 
to cut off 1/100s of a second when drag racing or it adds up to hundreds of 
pounds of differance then you will notice problems with long hill climbing 
just as you would with several more passengers on board than you would 
normally driving up the same hill!  The 205/75R15s are about 27" diameter and 
seem to be as close to stock diameter as you can get today, but are wider 
unfortunitly.  We have been plotting on purchasing the Cooper 195/82R15 due 
to being taller and narrower than the 205/75R15s.

  195 is mm width of tire.  Take this width and times against 82% and you 
have the tire wall hieght which equals 159.90mm.

  205 x 75% = 153.75mm.  As you see the side wall hieght of the 195s are 
6.15mm taller than the 205s.  So total diameter of the 195s are 12.30mm 
taller than the 205s!
 
 Not alot more, but every bit helps with our buses being lower geared than 
todays normal bustling freeway traffic and the 195s fit in the lower narrower 
pre-late 1962 bus rear wheel wells far more esier than the wider 205s.  The 
bigger the diameter of the tire will affect hill climbing to a certain point.

Hmm, lets see... 
15" rim times 25.6 (25.6mm = 1") = 384.00mm
Add the side wall of the 195s x 82% twice, 159.9 x 2 = 319mm
For a total of 703.80, which when divided by 25.6mm per inch = 27.49" 
diameter.

As above 15" rims times 25.6 = 384.00mm
Add the sidewall of the 205s x 75% twice, 153.75 x 2 = 307.50
For a total of 691.50, which when divided by 25.6mm per inch = 27.01" 
diameter.

We are sending this Email to the list to see what others have found out or if 
need be can correct this info!
