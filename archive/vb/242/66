Subject: Re: [VB] AGAIN an aluminum case update

Don't know about running hotter but they are definitely heavier. I went to
Jake Raby's shop to see about a new engine and he had an aluminum case
there. He had me pick-up a mag case and then the aluminum one and it was a
lot heavier. Felt like more than 15 pounds to me.

He said he had it there to do some R&D. He still isn't using them for any of
the engines he builds.

Funny, with all the threads on the alum. cases, the other day my  engine
builder ordered a new case for me, & was furious when the case arrived & it
was alum. instead of a regular vw case.  I asked him about the alum cases, &
he said they are "a mess".  He also said they run about 15 degrees hotter &
weigh about 15 lbs. more. (is there a 15/15 rule? grin)

Anyone know anything about the hotter/weight scenario?
