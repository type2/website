Subject: Pics needed of early rear apron

I'm looking for some pics of an early crank start rear apron, or does
it look the same as a later apron. Mine had been cut out for a bug
engine, and I'm in the process of repairing and filling the hole :-/

This is on a '57 kombi, if that matters at all.

thanks,
