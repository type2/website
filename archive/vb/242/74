If you can thin the paint out a lot, it might work.  If the gauge has
a little window that the light comes through, you could put a piece of
colored plastic over it, like in a Bus speedometer.  Theaters have sheets
of colored plastic for this purpose called 'gels' which can withstand
the heat of 500 W lamps.

In new cars, the green or orange illumination on the gauges is often
provided by regular clear bulbs with silicone rubber "condoms" over
them.  APM Hexseal seems to be the manufacturer:

For retail sources, check a Ch(-at-)vy or F(-at-)rd hot-rod magazine.
