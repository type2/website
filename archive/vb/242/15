You've got a lot of good questions there.
I'd first off handle getting to and from work in whatever vehicle you can
do it in.
Possibly even a note lot car if that is what is required.
Most of the other things like to wireloom are available new but you
already know the cost involved there.
I'd just set the bus aside and patiently gather the required parts as
money comes to you that you can spare.
The new wireloom is about $175.00 (just one offer I saw, might be less
from other sources)
If you get your list made you can post it to several VW internet sites
and possibly help someone clean out their garage and get some decent
prices on the parts you need.
I'd throw some free parts your way but all I have is 80-83 Vanagon Air
Cooled parts.
Contact one of the local Towing / Note Lots / Used Car Dealers and they
can fill you in on how to get a new title.
