There's not really a formula, because the efficiency of the bulb can
vary.  For example, a US-spec Bus parking light bulb takes 6.6 W to
make 6 CP (0.91 CP/W), but a US-spec front turn signal light bulb
takes 16.8 W to make 21 CP (1.3 CP/W).

The tables at http://www.type2.com/library/electris/bulbs.html may help
you.  It's geared towards US-spec Buses and bulb part numbers, but it
should give you the info you need.  Look at the first two charts to get
an ANSI number (81, 1129, etc) and a Normteile number (N 17 731 1, etc)
for the bulb you're interested in.  Further down, look up those numbers
in the ANSI bulb chart for the candlepower info and the Normteile chart
for the watt rating info.
