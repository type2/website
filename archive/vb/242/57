Subject: RE: [VB] clutch return spring

No spring on the clutch pedal arm, just the one on the tranny.  There is
supposed to be a brake pedal return spring.

Q:
here's a simple question. I don't have my bentley here handy at work
to consult. On my 66 is there supposed to be a spring under the front
seat area that holds the clutch cable in tension? My bus has one & it
seems like this would be the reason for the very hard clutch. It might
have been something the PO did to overcome a weak pivot spring on the
tranny. So is this spring supposed to be here or is this a PO
addition?
