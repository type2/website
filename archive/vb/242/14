Did that for several days & just cracked the wheel further.


Just went thru this procedure & the method that finally worked for me was
Dan Kinsey's (that vw guy handle ) in the archives- Heated the outside of
the inside of the steering wheel hub w/ a propane torch for a couple of
minutes after putting pb blaster in the hub & then pounded up on the bottom
of the wheel w/ my hands & it came right off!

Tom Buese-my learning curve is usually long & expensive
