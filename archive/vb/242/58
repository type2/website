That's the reason I opted to repair my case. That and the fact that it takes
the attorney general to make things right. No, I'll keep my attorneys fees
and transfer part of them to the block!


You know what they say when you assume something.

If a defect case is returned to us, why in the world would we sell it to
someone else?
That's bad business, and is insulting to be considered someone that would do
something like that.
Let me know if I read it wrong, but that's the impression it gave me.
