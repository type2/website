Aha ! So, if you had a WARRANTY, you could get a REFUND !

I still don't understand why you would be so "statistically "
unfortunate to receive a SECOND defective case.

Or, if you had been offered to purchase a warranty and declined,
you MIGHT get a defective case and have to keep it.
It looks like you saved a cool $50 !!! ( an aircooled $50 :)
I would like to do that myself !
But first, I would like to see the full list of known defects, 
and the full list of suckers.
