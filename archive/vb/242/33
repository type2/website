You obviously have me confused with someone 
who ....would spend two thousand dollars and
commit much time and effort in resolving new
defects a second time.
I'm just a shopper. I haven't purchased a new
case yet I don't know the statistical odds of
receiving a good one :)
Craig K  vwbus(-at-)ckoon.org  does. ( Less than slim:)
