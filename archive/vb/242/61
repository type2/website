 Hi Jason,
 Do you have the section and page/s that is on??  As far as we have ever 
heard 
 all makes of gas heater that exited the engine compartment we on the left 
 side of the engine.  So all 25, 36, & 40 HP bus air cleaners (Except for the 
 40 HP oversized bus air cleaner that was right side located to begin with.)
