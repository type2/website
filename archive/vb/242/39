Subject: wheel adapters and wheels

ok, before i spend a lot of time putting these things on ebarf, does 
anyone want these?
adapters: many makes, many patterns... some eelco, some empi/mr bug, 
some unmarked.
wheels: some i've identified, some incorrectly no doubt!
make me offers - i'm moving and stuff must go!
