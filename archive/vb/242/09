Subject: Pulling a Steering Wheel??

Has anyone tried one of the two prong pullers to pull a Steering Wheel?  I've
got to get this one off to sand and paint the dash.  Tried the old hitting
with a hammer and pulling up on it, won't move.  The one I got off of a junk
Bus came right off with a runner mallet.
