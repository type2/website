Subject: Re: [VB] AGAIN an aluminum case update

The first cases had many problems, including
being plugged with casting sand everywhere,
which anyone could see.

  If anybody would of had the so called casting sand checked they would have
seen that is was steel shot and black oxidized aluminum. When the cases were
cast they went into a giant conveyer shot peen machine for cleaning. The
cases come out of the molds BLACK and are then shot blasted to eliminate
this. They overloaded the machines, thus not getting a good cleaning of some
of the cases. This is why the so called casting sand was not in/on every
case in a numbered sequnce.
  I am not trying to defend the cases but want people to understand the
problems. Their are 100's if not 1000's of these engine cases out there
running just fine. When people want these from me I tell them of what to
expect and what MAY be needed to make correct and that has not stopped
people from still buying them.
  It's a shame though that a machine shop that has dealt with the cases from
the prototype stages misses some of the inheirent problems. They are very
aware of whats happening.
  I will still build these and am completeing a 1835 this week and am going
on to a 1914 using a NEW cast 74 stroke crank. Going to build a total BRAZIL
and Taiwan/China parts engine to see how it holds up.

ps. People are very aware of the problems with the aluminum cases and they
do have choices on different cases but yet still go with the aluminum, not
for the novice builder, that's for sure.
