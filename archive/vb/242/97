Subject: Re: [VB] Pics needed of early rear apron

unfortunately, in those pics, the bumper is in the way of where the apron 
tends to get cut.  The crank aprons are flat along the bottom edge, with no 
cut outs, as teh 36hp tailpipe hangs lower than the 1600/40hp tailpipe.   You 
can cut a section out of a later apron to paste in to fix he cut out, though. 
 

hope that helps.

ps great pics of the 55
