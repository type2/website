Subject: re:clubs in general

i have thought about joining a club every now and then, but this list is so
good, i can't imagine why i would join a club, unless it was a local club.

what i would look for in a local club-local folks who actually work on their
vw's themselves, people to compare notes with, learn tips from, share tips
with them, as well as tool sharing, organizing campouts, maybe some basic
tech info. at this point i know how to adjust my valves, change the
oil -basic maintenance, but when i was learning i would have loved to be in
a club that had basic how to seminars-with pizza or something. pick one guy,
or get one volunteer...this weekend he/she will teach you how to change your
oil. simple, 15 minute explanation-demonstration, then eat pizza. imagine
how this basic knowledge can change the perspective of a potential vw owner.
take the fear out of owning/working on your vw.

i have only been to some club meetings, when i lived in houston. i guess
what i see as the death of clubs: the die hard people stick it out for a
long time, eventually they are all that is left-as they don't institute
basic things to attract newcomers. this list has been amazing in its
welcoming/helping newcomers who know nothing(like i was) to the crazy
technical discussions about...well i am not quite sure what they are about a
lot of the time-but they are fun to read and try to figure out.

anyway, i am all for local clubs, but a national club doens't make sense to
me, when you have this list.
