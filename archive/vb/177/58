Dave,

Join the club if you are looking for original parts.  Wing bolts, dash
tabs and weld on's seem to be the hardest to find.  Original wiper
disconnects are around, but $$$$!    A friend paid 125 for NOS SWF
external ('64-'67?) and I saw rebuilt used internal (pre '64?) at OCTO
for $125 a set (thinking back I should have bought them) NOS will run
you close to $150 each!! People have them(safari parts), but are
hoarding them.  What an unusual thing to do with VW parts.  No one would
dare hoard old VW crap would they ;-)?

Seriously though, if you just want to use them (your windows),
call/email Creative Engineering or maybe Ronnie has some spares since he
was distributing for them?
