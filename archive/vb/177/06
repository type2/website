I have what seems the same step.   I loosened the bolts holdingthe aluminium 
to the slide ins, cleared out the jack points of dirt and rocks as best i 
could with a pokey thing, used a rubber malletto help slide them in, 
tightened up the bolts.  There is a separate bit when a bolt goes through the 
jack points and through a brace, no it clips on but you do have to drill a 
hole in the jack point.   Hm, I'll try to take a pic cause I doubt this 
explanation helps much.

Anyway the step is very cool.  Not just for stepping into the bus, but for 
reaching the roof rack.
