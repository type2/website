Is that the culprit?  My Tiger CDI unit makes an almost identical whining noise -- makes me think of a dog whistle.  I've heard TVs make a somewhat 
similar sound.  It's annoying, and I've never completely understood why that sound occurs.  I assume both the converter and the CDI are doing it for 
similar reasons....
