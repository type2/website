Subject: rear disc brakes

  coming to a bus near you soon. I have just about got all the components to
complete my rear disc brake conversion for big nut trannys (64-67) rgb  and
after these are done are going to see what it will take to adapt them to 68
to 79 type 2's. These will also have an e-brake.
