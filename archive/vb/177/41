Yeah.  The windings on an inductor of some sort are moving a little bit
in response to the current passing through them.  The CDI is probably
running at some frequency from 1 to 15 KHz and the high voltage transformer
in TVs is running at 15.7 KHz (in the USA).  There is a little more info
at http://www.repairfaq.org/REPAIR/F_tvfaqa.html#TVFAQA_010 .
