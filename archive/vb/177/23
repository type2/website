If you undo the pass side and middle dash tray mounting screws, you can drop 
the tray a tad and it's easier to remove the wiper motor.  Crucial, I think, 
for the motors with frames (65067) - esp as its a good idea to examine all 
the linkages

 I managed to get the motor and its mounting plate out from under the
 dash with the parcel shelf in place but it was a tight fit.  I had
 to make a fist between the shelf and the dash to squeeze the shelf
 down to get clearance.  If I did it again I'd take the motor+plate
 off and then take the plate off the motor while it was still behind
 the dash.
