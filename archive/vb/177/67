Hi Dave,
The cable on the left is choke the cable on the right is reserve.  Best to 
loosen the nuts on the backside of the panel and just remove the cables and 
thier sheaths at the same time.  Once out you could try looping the cables, 
this might flex the rusted cables inside free from the outer sheaths.  If so 
slide the cables out of the sheaths to be polished via sandpaper.  If they do 
not come out get replacement cables.  Either way if you get the old ones free 
or get new ones you must pull the cables out of thier sheaths and lubribacte 
with lithium grease mixed with graphite.  This will not only prevent stuck 
cables, but allow easy one handed operation instead of having to two handed 
grunt it!
