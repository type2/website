The motor in my '64 wasn't all that noisy but was very slow.  Freeing up
a stuck wiper pivot helped some, but I finally pulled the motor out to
have a look.  The oil was separating from the grease and running down on
to the commutator, making for bad contact with the brushes.  Just cleaning
the oil off the commutator and brushes sped it up a lot, but I went ahead
and repacked the gear box.  If you get into the gear box note that one of
the gears has a tiny thrust washer on its shaft that's easy to miss or
lose.

I went ahead and worked over the commutator too - polished it up with
sandpaper and then cleaned out the grooves with a pocket knife.  The
brushes were OK but weren't used to the commutator polishing - I hooked
it up while it was out of the car and I could make it run faster by
squeezing the brushes.  I just let it run for a while with no load and
the brushes formed themselves to the commutator - I could squeeze on
them and it wouldn't run any faster.

I managed to get the motor and its mounting plate out from under the
dash with the parcel shelf in place but it was a tight fit.  I had
to make a fist between the shelf and the dash to squeeze the shelf
down to get clearance.  If I did it again I'd take the motor+plate
off and then take the plate off the motor while it was still behind
the dash.
