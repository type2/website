That's fine.  It'll drop a little when loaded by the radio.  The system
voltage in a "12 V" car ranges from about 10 volts (cranking) to about
15 volts (high engine revs, light electrical load).

No.  Use at least 16 gauge wire for both runs.  14 is better and 12 is
probably as big as you need to go for the distances in a Bus.  If you
put the inverter far from the fuse box, put the inline fuse near the
fuse box so it will blow if the long wire shorts out.

The 5 amp is probably what some PO had lying around.  It will also limit
the inverter to less than 2.5 amps output.  For your purposes it's probably
best to run the original 8 amp fuse.

>And what does the 3 AG mean?

Number 3 Automobile Glass.  That's the spec for the physical size of the
fuse.
