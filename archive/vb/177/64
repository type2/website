was writ:
Do many people run them? What have been the effects of
long term use?
I simply ask this because I'm considering fitting an
aftermarket shifter to my 67 Panel to tighten up the
gear changes & to avoid the hit miss approach many
shifters seem to have with reverse gear.

********
try checking the bushing on yours, as well as the bracket that the shift rod
goes through-if it has ovaled out at all-it could cause problems. if you
replace the bushing and it is squishy(as noted by john) i think it means the
guide is ovaled out. because when i put mine bak together it was a very
tight fit, no slop at all.

also there was a replacement(as noted in the bentley, don't have it with me
right now so i can't ref. the page)bracket that goes inside the cab at the
base of the shifter. it is the gearshift lever stop, P/N 211 711 145A.
anyway they modified at a certain point-so if you open this up, put the new
one in. check the bentley-they have drawings of both. the thing helps with
putting the bus in reverse.

also i think you can adjust where you locate the shifter on the floor(minor
adjustment here) to help with shifting. ronnie had suggested to me loosening
the bolts a little, then put the bus in reverse, then tighten the bolts.


oh yeah what is power shifting?
