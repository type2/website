In theory, you can adjust the contact points inside it, kind of like
adjusting the distributor or a horn.  In practice, both Muir and VW
advise against it, mostly I think because it's hard to do well without
a generator test bench.

It's probably drawing too much current from the inverter, which drops
the voltage down low enough that it won't work.  You might be able to
improve things a little by adding a capacitor on the output of the
inverter to help supply the big current peaks (e.g. bass hits) to the
radio.  Use a capacitor that's rated at least 25 volts and as big as
you can get - something like a 4700 uF, 35 V one from Radio Shack for
about $4 may help.  Connect the positive lead to the wire between the
inverter and the radio and the negative lead to ground.  This probably
won't cure the problem, but may allow you to run the radio a little
longer or a little louder without it cutting out.  The car stereo people
have huge capacitors that cost $50 - $100, but that kind of money is
better spent upgrading your inverter.

The Bentley calls for generator voltages from 6.3 to 8.1 volts depending
on generator type and load, so yours is within spec.
