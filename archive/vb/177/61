Subject: slide in step question

i don't have the fancy slide in step, but i do have a step that is basically
a two solid bent bars tat go into the jack points, then a square piece of
tubing acts as the step.

anywya the way mine was attached-there were holes drilled through the jack
points. but insteasd of a bolt-which can, and probably will rust-i use a
clevis and hair pin type cotter pin.  i replaced the ones that were on it
with stainless steel ones-they have also rusted a bit, but with the cotter
pin, they are pretty easy to remove. you will want to be able ot remove
easily, if you are ever sliding under that side of the bus.
