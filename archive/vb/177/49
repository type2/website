Subject: voa rack for sale.

I have a voa rack I'd like to get rid of. 5 1/2 to 6ft long. If you want one
for a show car this isn't it. no clamps, but it does still have the threded
part that attaches to the frame and the previous owner used half a turn
buckle threaded onto these for clamps without trouble. $135/offers/possible
trades. Located in springfield Oregon and it's not something I want to ship.
