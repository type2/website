I have found that #4 steel wool and Semi chrome or Wenol, polishes the
trim
very well--I have done it right on the bus with excellant results--

I never advocate the use of steel wool.
Steel wool deposits minute steel pins, shavings, fibers into any softer
material that you use it on.
This deposited material will eventually rust even under clear finishes.
Regular old automotive white rubbing compound and elbow grease followed
up by semi chrome or regular automotive cleaner polish is the ticket.
Consider that the Deluxe trim was anodized which constitutes the etching
of the aluminum with chemicals and then a chrome plating overlay. You
just aren't going to get back there with any polishing job.
Many Mag Wheel cleaners will bring back even coloration and remove the
chalking.
A good coat of Varithane clear as a sealer after this procedure will give
you a few years before you have to do the job again.
