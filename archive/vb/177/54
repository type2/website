When these cables get stuck it usually is at the back end as they come out
of the tubes to connect to the heater box.. The rubber covers rot off the
cables and dirt starts filling in at the back of the bus welding what exists
with rust. I used a coat hanger wire (blunt at one end) in a drill and
proceeded to drill the tube ends out with large applications of penetrating
oil. Finally broke thru... cleared out the old wire bits and then installed
the new....
