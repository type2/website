What's the concensus?<

I cannot agree with that at all.  Once you see the Berg shifter you will 
realize what a work of art it really is.

I can see bushings and connectors wearing out in the linkage, but not the 
shifter itself.

It makes the stock shifter look like a piece of tinfoil.

Take Care,
Adrian
