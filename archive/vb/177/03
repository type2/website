then
turn off. i think this is when i have the volume too loud.

If you've installed a radio that was recently manufactured it requires a
ground and feed wire to each speaker.
In other words each speaker has its own ground back to the radio and then
a feed wire.
For rear speakers it requires 4 wires, just like the fronts.
If you try using the old three wire common ground the radio will sputter
and chirp when you turn the volume up but seems ok at low volume.
