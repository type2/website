Subject: Westy repro hitches

Is anyone making these as previously discussed? I almost have a welder
convinced to do this for us, but we would require specs and/or a sample
to fashion them off of. The only mod I imagine that WOULDN'T be OE
style, is the use of a threaded, replaceable ball that would screw into
a welded insert.
