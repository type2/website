Mmmm, these are all good questions & I will endeavour
to ask some people in the know the answers.
It's entirely possible this was the case in as far as
the air vents go because it involves an entirely
different side panel.
I'll try & find out.
Incidentally, Deluxes in general are VERY rare in Oz &
you're lucky to have one from here.
Is yours still RHD?
