actually it is a brand new s*ny CD/MP3 player. but i didn't notice anything
in the instructions about grounding the speakers. each speaker just has two
connections, a positive and neg. maybe it grounds through the negative wire.
actually the spade type connectors are different sizes so you can only hook
it up one way.

 got the radio installed. it works...kind of. it will work for a while
then
turn off. i think this is when i have the volume too loud.

If you've installed a radio that was recently manufactured it requires a
ground and feed wire to each speaker.
In other words each speaker has its own ground back to the radio and then
a feed wire.
For rear speakers it requires 4 wires, just like the fronts.
If you try using the old three wire common ground the radio will sputter
and chirp when you turn the volume up but seems ok at low volume.
