In the instructions with the Berg shifters it says no power shifting
allowed.  A bus shifter is a lot bigger lever than a bug one.

What I found with my 67 is that the little plastic bushings sold now are
so squishy that they really don't keep the shiftrod centered well.  I put
in one of the heavier shift rod bushings, the kind with a metal ring (I
took the metal ring out though) and it works better.  A bus is never going
to shift like a bug with all that linkage though.
