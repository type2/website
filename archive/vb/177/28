Some questions on the Berg, Empi & Hurst shifters.
While they obviously perform well first up what sort
of longevity do they have?
A reputable source here in Australia runs a Berg
shifter in a heavily modded Baywindow and he told me
that while it was good to begin with his tendency to
quick shift has meant the slow deterioration of his
Berg shifter.
One of his employees runs a Bay panel with an Empi
shifter & it seems to have lasted a little better but
then again the panel is practically standard & is
treated a little softer.
By & large though his experience has been that both of
these type of shifter seem to get pretty second rate
within 4 to 5 years.
What's the concensus?
Do many people run them? What have been the effects of
long term use?
I simply ask this because I'm considering fitting an
aftermarket shifter to my 67 Panel to tighten up the
gear changes & to avoid the hit miss approach many
shifters seem to have with reverse gear.
:o)
