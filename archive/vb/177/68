  You can get all the parts you need from Wolfgang, so you can at least use
your windows till you find the real stuff. My 60 DC I have found all OG
parts and in my 63 flipseat I keep putting in OG parts as I find them and
just use Wolfgangs for the time being. I got 2 dash tabs (OG) at OCTO for 25
dollars, so Now I only need the weld ins, wing nuts and 2 more dash tabs to
complete my windows with OG stuff, but they work just fine with the repo
crap.

Dave,

Join the club if you are looking for original parts.  Wing bolts, dash
tabs and weld on's seem to be the hardest to find.  Original wiper
disconnects are around, but $$$$!    A friend paid 125 for NOS SWF
external ('64-'67?) and I saw rebuilt used internal (pre '64?) at OCTO
for $125 a set (thinking back I should have bought them) NOS will run
you close to $150 each!! People have them(safari parts), but are
hoarding them.  What an unusual thing to do with VW parts.  No one would
dare hoard old VW crap would they ;-)?

Seriously though, if you just want to use them (your windows),
call/email Creative Engineering or maybe Ronnie has some spares since he
was distributing for them?
