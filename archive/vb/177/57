Well, this is not good.  I just re upped for two years and bought a Spec
Guide.  I did not get the guys name and did not recognize him (bigger
guy with glasses).  I did get a current OBR (its color now) issue?  The
one with Dana's Alaskan DC on the cover.  It has one of Tom's tilts BTW.

That's about all I can tell you from my experience on Sunday.
