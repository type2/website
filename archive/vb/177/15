Actually, "converter" or "DC-DC converter" is a good description.
Technically, an "inverter" reverses the polarity of the input voltage,
but that word is also used to describe the boxes that make AC from DC.

First tip: audio amplifier marketing people love to specify "max power"
output.  This is the power the amplifier can produce over a very, very
short period of time.  It is a bit like saying a 1600 can move a loaded
Kenworth...it probably _can_, but it won't last very long.

The continuous power output is usually about half of the maximum, or in
this case, about 26 W into four channels, or 104 W total.  Another way
to figure out what a radio really can do is to look at what its main power
fuse is rated.  Lots of radios have a 10 A fuse which implies they can
continuously draw something less than 120 - 140 W total depending on the
supply voltage.  Because of conservation of energy, the power delivered
to the speakers can never be more than the power input to the radio.
This impliess that a radio with a 10 A fuse can deliver around 30 W x 4
to 35 W x 4 or so maximum - in reality you will get less.

You are thinking correctly.  The converter spec means that you can get 3 A
from the 12 V side, or 36 W.  If the converter was perfectly efficient,
it would draw 6 A on the 6 V side - in reality it will draw more.
