I also got tired of the backstabbing and trying to get people to do
the right thing and resigned from being editor last April.

The new editor is John Foley and you can reach him at barndoor(-at-)etcrier.net.

George Bossarte is supposed to handle all membership inquiries and you
can reach him at gbeng(-at-)world.std.com.

Good luck,
