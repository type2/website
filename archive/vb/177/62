Subject: re:berg shifter installed

i think that front shift rod bushing makes a big difference-i just did the
same to my bus. no more grinding-ever. i also changed out the plate that the
bushing goes in(mine had ovaled a little. it is supposed to be a perfect
circle.

what exactly is super syncing?
