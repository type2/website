Hi Ronnie,
That damage is probably due to driving into a too low of garage or parking 
building!  We won the bus loading contest by sending a photo of our 1960 walk 
thru panel camper conversion with rear 2/3s of a 1955 bug body on top facing 
backwards.  We had cut it across the windshield posts and just below the door 
hinges.  Took four guys to lift it in place.  The nose had been totally 
crushed!  Then drove at highway speeds 50 miles home.  Got ALOT of double 
looks from folks working outside thier homes on a sunny day!
