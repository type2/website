Subject: re:6v to 12 converters

was writ:
"I have one powering my radio now and it works OK.  The main problem is
that it is both electrically and mechanically noisy.  On FM the electrical
noise is no problem, but it makes AM stations hard to hear.  The mechanical
noise is that the converter whines, even under no load (converter on, radio
off).  I tried to tighten up the transformer mounting but wasn't too
successful; I may try painting the windings with some kind of sealant to
immobilize them."

mine actually whines too, but i real high pitch, which changes when i turn
the radio on-but it still constantly whines. as for static-i haven't noticed
any at all-in am or fm. although i only tried am a little bit. i will try
again with the am.
