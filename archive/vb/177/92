Subject: Distributor Questions

I'm running a 009 distributor on my 1600 sp motor...

Today I hooked it up to the scope at school and it appears the timing is
hovering around 40 degrees regardless of idle speed.  (However, I've only
been able to get the idle down to around 1400 rpm... Just rebuilt the
30pict3 carb today and I'm not sure what the idle speed should be, it seems
to run rough below that.)

Anyway, it does appear the springs in the distributor are working, but may
be very weak?  Does this make sense?  Could this be a contributing factor in
my persistent overheating problem?  I've been suspecting the distributor for
a long time, but without proof until now.  Guess I'd better start saving my
pennies....
