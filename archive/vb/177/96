Subject: RE: [VB] Re: polishing trim

I agree with Ronnie.  Used to use Bon Ami in the Army before inspections to
polish up my brass buckles, buttons, etc.  I learned about from my dad, who
used to use it on everything metal that needed polishing-even the copper
bottoms of my mothers pots & pans.  If you want a real expensive version of
Bon Ami-go to any FLAPS and buy whatever chrome polish they have-probably
the same thing.
