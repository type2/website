CE sells parts.

The safaris glass is smaller than the windsheild glass.   You would need
to
get safari frame, seal, windsheild glass, latches, dasg tabs, etc,
sounds
like close to a full set.  Sounds like you have the bits thewing nuts
thread
into- the brackets at each siode and the middle.    Probably a company
that
makes safaris would sell partial kits, could ask at least.
