Subject: NEATO (not for the faint at heart if you are a NEATO lover)

Can someone tell me HOW TO GET AHOLD OF SOMEBODY AT NEATO!!  Web site is no
good. Have missed the last 2 issues (4 months) and want to know whats going
on. Pay dues a year ahead and still nothing happens. Kind of reminds me of
SOTO. I would say to NEATO get it together soon. Know Tom is trying but it
takes more than 1 person. Missed OCTO, what was happening at the NEATO booth?
Who used who to get rid of who? Looks like the best VW Bus club going now is
SVII and their chapters  No one inside NEATO seems to want to do anything. Is
Everywhere Ed still Prez? What are the DOD's doing? Been a member for over 10
years and want to cont. Tried to change things and get stuff rolling as a DOD
a few years ago but got beat down on all counts so gave up. Hell, you can get
more info and pictures on  Everetts Samba page. Enough for now as I hope this
will stir up a few NEATO members and get the NEATO ball rolling again.
These are my thoughts and not those of the London Bridge Bullies ( a NEATO
chapter)
