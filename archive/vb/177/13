I bought a couple at the swap meet at the Tulsa VW show last year.  I
think I paid $5 for one and $10 for the other.  They were both Radio
Shack units, rated 12V 3A output.

I have one powering my radio now and it works OK.  The main problem is
that it is both electrically and mechanically noisy.  On FM the electrical
noise is no problem, but it makes AM stations hard to hear.  The mechanical
noise is that the converter whines, even under no load (converter on, radio
off).  I tried to tighten up the transformer mounting but wasn't too
successful; I may try painting the windings with some kind of sealant to
immobilize them.
