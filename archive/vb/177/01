Subject: rolling again

thanks to all! the bus is running again. best it ever has, crisp shifting.
flushed brake fluid this past weekend, adjusted brakes....

i got the radio installed. it works...kind of. it will work for a while then
turn off. i think this is when i have the volume too loud. so i keep the
volume down. seems to help. it seems to work fine with the engine off, but
when i start the engine, it generally sputters. sometimes it comes back on,
sometimes it doesn't. i checked the output on my regulator, it is aorund 6.4
or 6.5 at idle. then goes up to around 6.85-6.9 when in rev the motor.
doesn't seem as high as it should be. i beleive the bentley says it should
be around over 7. so i thought i should be able to adjust the regulator to
increase output.

i also think i may need to get one of those 5 amp inverters, to help
overcome the radio shutting off with my 3 amp inverter. i installed the
inverter right behind the front panels-so you don't even see it. the radio
is just sliding around on my dash tray-i haven't figur out how to secure it
(or the speakers)yet.

go go list. thanks for all your help
