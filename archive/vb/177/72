  The London Bridge Bullis are pleased to announce the creation of the Buses
by the Bridge web site. The url is www.busesbythebridge.com We have just
created it and it should be up in about a week.
  The site will contain all imformation related to the event, maps, cost,

  We hope this will help all that planning to attend and those that can't
