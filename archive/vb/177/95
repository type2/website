Hello Ted

Thanks for the Info

Eric



There ar no bushings to replace regarding the pittman arm.There is a
bushing and pin kit for the swing lever though.

	Has anyone recently replaced the bushing/bearings of the pitman
arm? Also can it be done in the vehicle and is it hard to do?

Thanks for your help,
