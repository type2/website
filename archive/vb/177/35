 Hey,I do have pride in my work. One look at my bus
and I hope it would be obvious,but I'll give you the
benefit of the doubt, though your post did come across
a little "slammy". As far as "understanding" is
concerned; that is why I posted to the list to begin
with. I had never used one of these alt's before and
wanted to do it right. 
 I do appreciate all of the replies but with a new reg
running around $80.00 ( I drive my vw too much to
trust used electrical parts, especially when you never
know why the donor car was junked to begin with!) plus
the need to bend linkage, I will go with the other
alternator as it seems a better buy for the long run.
