I'm curious about this.  From looking at the wiring diagrams, from _about_
'55 to '62, the low beams weren't fused but the high beams were.  Before
and after those years, both low and high beams were fused.  If the new
harness has fuses where the old one didn't, how is it done?  Do you need
to get a stock fuse box with more positions, or are there inline fuses?
If inline, do they take pointy-ended fuses or square-ended ones or blades
or...?

Seconded... My left tail light wasn't quite as bright as the right one,
and it came on slower than the right when I had the hazards on.  I had
convinced myself that the bulb holder was tight to the reflector and
the reflector was tight to the body.  Finally I added a ground wire
anyway, sure that it wouldn't help, and voila!  Nice bright quick-responding
light.
