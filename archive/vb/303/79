Hello all,

EveryBus (that includes Vanagons and Eurovans, for sure :) is coming 
up in just a little over 90 days.  EB is an annual gathering of 
Volkswagen Transporters that takes place each year in North Carolina. 
The event is a family camp out peppered with a few events to make 
life interesting without making it too serious.

Please visit the web site and consider attending.  The year's event 
will bring buses from both coasts, the hinterlands and Canada 
together for the sixth time in as many years. We look forward to 
seeing old friends and making new ones.

The web site is located at www.everybus.com and will be updated often 
over the next few months so if you plan to attend please keep 
checking back for the latest developments.

Thanks
Chris
