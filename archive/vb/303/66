Hi Matt,
When you give the carb jetting specs are you checking the jets sizes or just 
going off the stamped # on them?  If the latter we have found often that jets 
can be worn over time or drilled out by DPO or even the wrong size when new!  
Because of this it sounds like your main jet is way too big and that is over 
shadowing the idle jet and circuit.  
  Also you might try non-platnium spark plugs.  Have heard way too many volks 
complain about them though have never figured out why they have problems 
withy them.
