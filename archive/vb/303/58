Subject: Heeeere's Ole Kelvin--Again--

Well,
My ole buddy Kelvin is back from his trip from South Africa --and on the
prowl again--
Trying to buy Bus, Vanagon stuff from an ad I have in the Westfalia
owner's site--

Here is a copy of the message I sent him--after he needs pictucure's and
details on some big wattage light bulbs.

For those of you who are not yet aware--this guy is nuts--and a snake in
the grass--
Avoid anyone with a good story and a bogus check--Especially ole
Kelvin--

It seems he must roam around the internet seeking "Deals"

What I wonder is where this fool comes up with the "certified" checks he
sends out??
Ya think he's printing them??

And how in the heck does the message he sent say" possibly in Nigeria"
???
Doesn't the provider he's using know where he is??

Crazy--

I hope he sends me a response to this one--:>)

Later,

TK

Kelvin,
You old snake in the grass---
I see you have changed your E-Mail address, and your home country
again--
Last month you were a inhabitant of South Africa-- What a world traveler
you are--quite the lad--eh, what mate??

Let's see--

Last you prevaricated with me and you wanted my Vanagon jail bars , the
sky was the limit on price--no questions asked--and your "representative
here in the US" was going to be picking them up--after I accepted your
bogus, $2500.00, good for nothing, other than toitet paper "reader" (
word for a check here in Chicago --cause that's all ya can do is read
it--not spend it) and then becuase you think I'm some kinda super
dummy--just crawled out from under some rock kinda guy, you assumed that
I was out of the kindness of my Hungarian heart send you the change--

Yea--right---

And I'm Ringo Starr---

So Bozo--get a job--and drop my E-Mail address from your list of the
criminally insane, and unknowledgeable--

I hear Ya knockin'--But Ya Can't come in--
There are two chances of me getting sucked into your web--Spiderman--
(1) Slim--
(2) None

Adios Permanento El Bandito-----
