Subject: Friday question? anti freeze?please I need help

any one know if a new car came with green (reg anti
freeze) and some of the brown long term ati freeze was
put in the the system, do you know if the two mixed
would make a combination that would eat the ruber
seals and stuff on the inside of the cooling system ,
