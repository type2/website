Subject: Painting in Cold Weather

Tom,

My painting skills are not great but i had an
interesting experience with painting in the cold last
spring.  (Even in California it gets cold sometimes)

My bus got chilled overnight and i painted it the next
morning.  The paint went on fine and looked great but
i am told that because the metal was so cold and i did
not have heaters to help it along my paint "flashed"
and turned out very dull.  No shine at all although
the paint is very smooth.  Really weird and very
depressing.

I have painted 4 other cars so i know a little bit and
do not think it was anything other then the cold.  I
also spoke with my paint supplier and he agreed.  We
even tested the extra paint and room temp and all was
fine.

anyway, that is what i have experienced.  Oh ya.  It
was PPG Acrylic Urethane.

Matt
