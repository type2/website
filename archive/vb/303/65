I've run my daughter's iPod just laying on the bench seat next to me in 
my '65 and it works just like my portable CD player: power from a 
lighter socket I mounted up under the tray, and audio (headphones) out 
to the front-panel input jack on a graphic EQ/booster mounted under the 
tray to the left of the steering column, via a long patch cord with 
1/8" stereo plugs on either end.

The EQ's back panel input comes from an AM/FM/cassette unit sitting on 
the tray directly below the radio cutout (which is covered, thanks to 
Michael Heron).  But with that little audio-in jack on the front, I can 
pipe any source with a 1/8" headphone jack through the EQ and speakers. 
  Pretty handy.
