Subject: Complete wiring harness install on a 67-How hard, where from?

Hey Y'all,
I have an 67 bus that I rescued from a field, instead
of trying to comb through all the old brittle wires
and make it work, I am considering installing a
completely new wiring harness.  Is this a job that the
average bus guy can do with no major problems? Is
there anyone who has done this that can give me some
insider tips? AND I have found the harness at CIP1 for
about $210 and at Busdepot for about the same, is
there anywhere else out there that has a better price
on these??
