I would completely agree with this.  Having done my harness from Wiring 
Works on my Ghia last year, the diagram was wrong and took me more than 
a few days of staring at the wires to figure this out.  If they would at 
lest purchase a computer to make the diagrams then print them in color, 
they would be even better.  And a few wires were a little short as well. 
 I still would purchase another one from them, but use other wiring 
diagrams to hook everything up.  Thankfully my bus doesn't (I think!) 
need a new harness!
