West Coast Metric is also making wiring harness'. They are less expensive
then Wiring Works, but I prefer to support a small company verses a giant.
Bob has been doing this for
years and has been a great asset to the VW community., plus he has a good
used selection of fuse blocks and relays

I totally agree. In addition, the Wiring Works installation diagrams are a
little different than the VW diagrams in that they don't show all the wires
that are coming into the switch or fuse block if it's not part of the
individual harness that you are installing at the moment. A couple of new
wires were also not the exact same color or combo of colors, so a newbie
like moi got easily confused. But all in all a great product!

Tom Buese-still have turn signal/hazard light issues which aren't harness's
fault.
