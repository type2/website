Just going by the numbers.

I sort of wonder why it screws up when driving and coming back to idle,
but not when I start it and idle it.  I guess if it's just sitting there
idling, only the idle circuit is in play.  But when I've been driving,
enough air is getting sucked through the carb to bring the main jet into
play, and it could be putting in too much fuel?

>Also you might try non-platnium spark plugs.

I am and have been running regular Bosch (copper) plugs.  I just swapped
in the platinum one because I had it and I was trying to figure out if I
had a bad spark plug or some other problem on #4.  When the new plug didn't
help I went back to the copper one.

The Bentley procedure will show this, right?  (Torque down fuel pump flange
with gaskets, measure height that rod sticks up as you turn the engine over).

I'll check out the things you've mentioned and report.  Thanks!
