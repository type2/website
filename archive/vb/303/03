Hi Rene,
Just about anything can be done with enough cutting and welding, like 
installing a V8 engine.  VOA sold AC as a dealer installation in the 1960s.  We have 
only seen images of these with the condensor on the very rear of the roof 
(Check out "Skeleton Coast" a 1960s lame movie were for a second a split screen 
bus with AC drives by.).  VOA sold mid to late 1970s buses with AC and these can 
be found occassionally.  You can buy a new AC kit made for the hot rodding 
market for about $1100.00 today.  Do expect a drop in HP and acceleration when 
using the AC!
