Subject: RE: Fresh Air Box (was RE: [VB] Vent wing latchs)

OH MY GOD... flash back.... the over head vent seal and rivets were one
of the first things to go back in the double cab... way back when, right
after paint, and before AR syndrome set in...  and I think I used plain
ol' solid rivets and a WW seal.  I'm not sure I can go on with the rest
of the day now...   what a sinking feeling....

Thomas asked:
speaking of rivets, what's the correct rivet to hold together the 
overhead fresh air box internals?  I assume it's supposed to be
riveted... 
(mine isn't and the internals are currently sitting in a box, awaiting 
installation).
