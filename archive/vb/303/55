  In-line blade in a plastic holder on the parking light wire, is how I
remember it, I'd go out and check, but it is so cold out that my cats are
hugging the oil sealed radiator and the bus may shatter if I close the
door too hard!  I'll get back to you on that when it gets warmer here in
used jersey.

  One of my favorite quick fixes on friends VW's is turn the phillips
screw holding reflector bezel/body/bulb holder just a little tighter or a
little looser and the light becomes brighter - thats because the ground
tab is just barely funtioning.  The permanent fix is to add (solder) a new
wire from the bulb holdy body to ground.  Suprisingly, it also kept the
gendarms from following them and pulling them over for no particular
reason they said, funny how important that can be to some of my friends.

Best,
