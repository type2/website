Subject: Generator Troubleshooting

1600 DP in a 67 bus.  Can someone explain to me how
the generator is connected to the battery, voltage
regulator, and dash gen warning light?? What else is
hooked up to the voltage regulator other than battery
& generator.
  I put the voltmeter on the "DF" terminal when the
engine is running and get nothing.  When I turn
ignition switch on, the dash gen warning light does
NOT come on, but the bulb and ground at bulb holder
are confirmed good. So I am assuming I have something
hooked up wrong because the gen warning light should
come ON when key is on even if the generator is BAD,
right???
