Subject: Split Westy Glass & Screens

    Ricky Hobday's Granddad worked at Herr (spelling?) for many years and kept
in touch. He was able to get them to make a bunch of OG crank out window glass
in clear and in tinted with correct logo, also got them to make a bunch of OG
inside window screens and glass rubbers. He has them working on the crank
stuff now., not done yet. They will have them for sale at BBB8 .  Great touch
when rebuilding your Westy side windows. They will be there with their Dove
Blue 66 westy so look them up.. Ricky's Granddad can also read the date code
on your windows to see when they were made, he was in charge of the side
windows and can see if he made them. After making windows in SoCal they
shipped them to Germany....See ya at the front gate.
