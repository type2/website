Hello John  Heres how to test the gen and reg. Take the wires off of the gen 
hook your postive lead on volt meter to D+ and start the motor Take a jumper 
wire and hook to the Df and negative lead of meter touch this neg. wire to the 
body of the gen and rev the motor do not let it touch too long the voltage 
should jump somewhere close to 36 volts on a 12 volt system and about 18 volts on 
a 6 volt system. If it doesn't jump close to these voltages then gen is bad. 
If it does then test the reg by hooking the wires back on the gen and pulling 
the two wires off at the B+ terminal and hooking them together then hook your 
positive lead where they were and ground the neg lead start the motor and you 
should get about 13.5 for 12 volt system and about 7.5 for 6 volt  If you dont 
get these voltages then the reg is bad.  The little blue wire on the reg.at 
Df is for the dash lite. this works on a ground system. ground this wire and 
the dash lite should come on  later and have fun mark dearing   Salem Import
