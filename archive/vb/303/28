Subject: RE: [VB] [T2] friday topic new bussing song compilation

Hmm, this morning I played a Korean/Japanese duo that bill themselves
out as 'Seksu Roba' which translates to 'Sex Donkey'  (just don't go
typing that into google and expect a reasonable response!)  let's see,
what else, Ted Leo, Left Front Tire, Dufus, Ladybug Transistor, Bjork,
etc.  During the first hour of the show was a favorite world music title
from Fiamma Fumana.

... life is too short for only one CD!  Then again, none of my drivable
split window busses have on-board music.  The running of the bus is too
important :-)
