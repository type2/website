Not yet.  I did rebuild this carb (including me dunking it in a carb
bucket, and the shop I had rebush the throttle shaft cleaning it) in
spring 2003 and it's had less than five or six tanks of gas through it
since then.  But, I don't know what the condition of my gas tank is.
The fuel filter doesn't have any obvious boulders in it, but the paper
element is dark brown.

It came that way from the previous owner.  It does have a jet screwed
into the right side of the carb where I think the cutoff solenoid would
go.
