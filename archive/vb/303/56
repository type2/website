Daniel Nelson (danieln(-at-)atiba.com) ask me to pass along this message 
to the type2 list for him since he is no longer a type2.com member.
He said Amanda spent the night at his house in Nashville last night,
And he took some photos of her and the 66 bus which you can view
at his live journal entry.

"Amanda got my contact info off of the AIRS list, a online directory
of VW freaks like myself. She's from Montana and passed through
Nashville on her way south for the winter. She has a great bus,
and 2 very big and lovable dogs. I was able to give her a place
to crash for the night, we swapped music, and I took her to breakfast.

She has a great 66 Sundial and she's been living in it for the past 2
years. She had great stories of how cool VW people have been to her."
