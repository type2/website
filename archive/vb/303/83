Hi Tom,
I live Down Under so I only suffer the low temp issues
for a couple of months and it's high summer here at
the moment.
But as far as getting the rust off the difficult bits,
have you considered using POR-15 or a similar
treatment on the underbody before painting that'll
simply convert any surface rust before you paint.
I'm planning on doing the similar thing to my '67
Panel but instead of using standard paint I'm using
Rustkill epoxy based paint and simply brushing it on.
It converts any surface rust and gives a hard coat
that will stand up to stone chips.
I think you could well have problems if you try to
sandblast with the brake hoses still connected but I'm
no expert there.
The other thing about a wire wheel is that it doesn't
necessarily get all of the rust off even on even
surfaces as I found out today while I was getting the
rust off a tube steel nudge bar for my brother's beach
buggy.
An orbital sander is a better bet there.
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
