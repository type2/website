Subject: Re: [VB] Replacing Front Trans mount

Hi Todd,
Do you have the bus rear end on jack stand so the rear tires are off the 
ground?  If so then you might be able to pry the tranny back enough to replace the 
front tranny mount.  
  If that does not work you just have to remove the RGB mounting bolts to the 
spring plates, make sure the E-brakes are off, and pull the tranny and axles 
back just enough.  If that still does not work then taking the front end of 
the E-brake cables off the E-brake might be needed.
  EITHER WAY you must be carefull not to push or pull too hard, or risk 
having the bus fall off the jack stands.  Which has happened to at least one list 
member that we know of when installing his tranny, trapping him under his bus.  
We prefer to build a square stack of 4x4s under the cargo area and have our 
buses on that instead of jack stands for that reason.
