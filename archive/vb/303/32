Subject: Bocar 34PICT carbs

Well, after rebuilding this latest one this morning I am getting
frustrated in universal gasket kits. I have got three kits recently from
three separate sources and all three do not have the triangular cut out
in the float bowl gasket for the air holes on the three jets. The German
and Brazilian carbs have two jets in this area and the Mexican Bocar has
an additional circuit adding a third jet in a triangular configuration.
I normally just take my Exacto knife to a German gasket and make the
little "roof" to the rectangular cut out, but I sure would like to find
a gasket kit that has real Bocar gaskets. On top of that, there are
three different body configurations of the Bocar 34 between 1971 and
1976 with deferent vacuum lines and the forth one I don't mess with, the
CA model, yuk.

Anyone know of a source for correct gaskets, let me know. Oh, and I am
looking for another throttle butterfly, I fried one during a solder job
on the air bypass hole, now I'm short a plate.

Thanks
