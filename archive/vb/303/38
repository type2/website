Miss Amanda Roth pulled up here last night for crash space (slept on the
couch, not in the bus--it's cold here finally and she has no heat). Quite a
nice young lady and we enjoyed her visit. She is on extended tour and some
of you have met her.

She is headed Nashville way, I think then on to the Jack Daniels distillery
in Lynchburg (she said she thought that would make for some interesting
photo opportunities), after that I know not.

If you see a green 66 Sundial hardtop with rusty rockers, requisite
stickers, bicycle mounted on the back, Tennessee and thereabouts, that might
be her. Please look out for her and keep her safe, she's traveling alone but
for her dogs.
