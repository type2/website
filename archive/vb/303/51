Hm, I have another addition... this morning it occurred to me that I 
often listen to Phish while driving my Bus.  Unfortunately, you can't 
really listen to Phish songs in a vacuum... and if I were forced to 
pick one CD to carry with me in my Bus it would have to be:

A Picture of Nectar (studio album)    -- Phish

When you've been on the road all day and your legs and back are tired 
and you feel like you really need a break, then suddenly _Cavern_ comes 
on, you perk right up, sit up straight, and can tap your fingers again. 
  I think that's the hallmark of good driving music.
