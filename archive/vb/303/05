We offer an A/C stystem specifically made for the split bus:

Definitly not a "hack job" or anything like that. They are not universal a/c
kits that you have to bang your knuckles to mofidy everything so it will
work in your application. They include everything you need to install,
except tools and the R-134a.

One thing that must be noted. Today's A/C compressors are NOTHING like those
of yesteryear. They draw only a few horsepower, unlike the old models that
used to pull down 10-12 (that would have a major effect on our VW's, and
part of what have the a/c systems of the 70's gave a bad name on our VW's).
There is also another A/C company that is making systems for VW's (only bugs
I believe), and instead of using electric fans to cool the unit off, they
stick the thing on the back of the shroud. This is obviously bad for all the
reasons we don't need to get into right now. The system we carry is very
efficient, no welding or anything is needed. You do need to cut holes
(obviously) to run the lines, but that's it. And anyone that knows how to do
bodywork, knows that closing up holes is not a big deal if the sytem is ever
replaced.
