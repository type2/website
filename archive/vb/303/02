Subject: Re: [VB] Complete wiring harness install on a 67-How hard,

> Hey Y'all,
 I have an 67 bus that I rescued from a field, instead
 of trying to comb through all the old brittle wires
 and make it work, I am considering installing a
 completely new wiring harness.  Is this a job that the
 average bus guy can do with no major problems? Is
 there anyone who has done this that can give me some
 insider tips? AND I have found the harness at CIP1 for
 about $210 and at Busdepot for about the same, is
 there anywhere else out there that has a better price
 on these??

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

I believe that 99.9% of all the new, aftermarket wiring harness's out there are made by a person/company
called Wire Works or The Wire Works. So the price should be very close with the difference being the percent
of markup for resale profit.....
With that in mind:
There is a company, ISP-West in Carson Calif, that does a lot of business on that auction site under the name
of pimppride. They sell harness's all the time. But right now all they have listed are 7 Ghia harness's.
[spelling is not high up on their list..... they leave the E in wiring so you have to search spelling it 'vw
wireing'.....] If you look at each one, they have a reserve. The one that is $137 right now has not met
reserve, but the one that is $209 has....  On their web site, they want $245 and it is made Wire Works:
http://www.vwispwest.com/catalog/WK-211ALL000.htm
Their auction reserve is always lower than their store price......

www.busdepot.com shows it for $208:  http://www.busdepot.com/busdepot/details.jsp?partnumber=211998028A
