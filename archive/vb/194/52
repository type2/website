Subject: Re: [VB] JCWhitney tie rod removal tool - not worth the money

Sears ..... Craftsman ..... They have tie rod removers and they are
garanteed for life. You can weld a nut that fits the tie rod thread to a
hardened piece of 1" round stock, screw it on till it bottoms out then snug
it up (make sure that you still have space between the nut and the arm) then
smack it with a good sized hammer. The shock and force pops them right
apart. I use one I made for diesel truck tie rods and it works every time
and it cost me zip to make it (actually got paid to make it since I was on
the clock).
