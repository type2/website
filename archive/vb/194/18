Subject: Sheared RB bolt - clues?

I sheared a reduction box bolt last night :(. I'm
looking for clues to mak emy life easier during
the repair.  It broke below the plane of the housing,
so it's going to have to be drilled and tapped. 
I'm hoping someone will have some bit of wisdom to
impart to make it easier - other than "don't set the
impact on 'kill' when you put them in"

Thanks!

Thom
