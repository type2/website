the digital immage will have to be "digitized"
by hand buy a crew down in the ozarks that know about how it will look when it
is ran on the computerized embroderer... they acualy "stich it" *by hand*
simulating a needle and thead with their computer. this process costs 80 bucks
if i'm going to do it as a thank you to airs i need a clearer image. the
design is real good and worthy of AIRS though...
i could make the results avalable to any AIRS member who wants it after my
original recipiant gets theirs 1st. 

this will be posted on the VB list to see if anyone can scan their shirt or
what-have-you...
