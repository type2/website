Hi Thom,

  That has happened once to me before, along with stripping out the
regular holes with putting them in just slightly crooked (live&learn!).

  Eric and Barb, hard to tell which, as if it mattered, I give them both
VW kudo points for helping me out - and I believe it is the "do it right
way" proceedure - it is in the root celler where they keep this lists
archives, try a little Barley Wine, Mead, Cider, Sake, Fruit Wine from the
lagering oak barrels happy valves and toast to Eric & Barb and the Holiday
Season.

  My advice...Go slow!, you must try to get the exact center of the bolt!
Punch, Drill, and use an easy-out to take the bolt out, E&B recommend
going a bit further and use longer RGB studs. Then tap and replace with a
time cert.  I'll let you borrow mine to save you a few bucks.

Best,

joe
