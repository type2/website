Subject: Re: [VB] Spongebob bus source?

Well, I'd buy one if there weren't any strings attached. 

Here's my splanations...

1. It's the cheapest and best quality. Barbie's microbus will be $5 at the swap 
meet next year but that's with a years worth of blonde inflicted dents and 
damage. Not true with made-for-collectors overpriced crap like the HW hotrod 
bus series. 

2. The more the merrier. We all like to see lots of buses lined up at bus 
meets. I like lots of buses on my shelf too. Squint my eyes and relive the day. 
(note to self - create D&D type game based on AZ bus weekends)

3. It's a vote. If bus toys fly off the shelves hopefully it'll cause R&D money 
to enter the stream. A letter to the companies asking for more variety helps 
and a "I bought all your same-mold toys, make some interesting models" lends 
credibility. A "bus toys don't move" message will stop every bus toy. 

4. It's cultural history. Sponge Bob Square Pants will be as cute as a Buddy L 
bus in 40 years. Japanese tin buses were cheap and crude in their day, now have 
charm and value. 

5. Convenience. My mantle can hold a lot more buses than my driveway.
