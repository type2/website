Subject: Confession: My new VW is a Subaru

Hi,

I saved this confession for Friday.

I bought a brand new car with a flat-4 engine, though it isn't a VW. 
It's a Subaru.

I wanted to wait to buy a new Microbus - but I needed a new car now - 
so said the wife (the motivator in this deal).

I never stepped foot into a VW dealership because of VWoA's treatment 
of the aircooled community. Two recent Press Releases should give VWAG 
and VWoA a hint - 17% sales decline in North America and VW's very 
first 8 cylinder engine.

Anyways, at least it is a flat-4 which VW seems to have forgotten about 
altogether. And sitting at a stop light, it feels and sounds familiar. 
Lift the hood, and everything is where I remembered it -  the 
alternator is standing on top of the engine - what a novel concept.

The salesman said that Subaru has been using the same flat-4 engine 
design for 25+ years - and has kept it because it is reliable and easy 
to maintain. Wow, another novel concept.

BTW, you can no longer email VW unless you own a VW with a valid VIN - 
whatever that is. So it's time for me to get out the quill and paper 
and let them know.

Conrad
