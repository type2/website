Is anyone else out there using the Bosch SVDA (SDDA) Distributor, with vacuum
advance Part #: IGD0001 from AirCooled.net ? So far the three I've seen are
each in different bodies but all have the same Wells  RV1001 vac can on them.
Besides mine, which is on a .009 body, I have seen one on a .019 and a 205
body. The curve is supposed to be the same and the points, cap, and rotor are
all .009 parts. The one on the .019 Porsche body was getting it's vacuum from
a vac line on the intake neck below the carb on a DP motor. The other took it
right off the 34 PICT where it was supposed to. So far I have had no problems
with mine and I like the curve.

Bernoulli Interval: Do I really have enough data to draw a valid conclusion ?
