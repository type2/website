Subject: RE: [VB] Mirror bracket?

Thanks for the replies regarding the bracket for my elephant ear
side-view mirror.  The answer to several people's question is that it
isn't an original VW dealer-installed mirror, but rather an aftermarket
one I put on about 10 years ago, so I'm afraid the VW models won't fit.
I think I'll be buying a replacement for the whole thing.

Thanks,
