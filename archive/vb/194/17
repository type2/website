Subject: Re: [VB] South-West area camper warning

Certainly the greatest threats to campers in the south-west are not the 
wolves, lions, el tigre or bears.  It's the greed heads in corporate 
headquarters and kiss butt employees at BLM and the US Dept of 
Forestry....   These people are taking away our camping areas, and of 
course destroying the habitat of the lions, tigers and bears, oh no......

Lots of us own VW buses because they are such great camping vehicles.  
Wolves will help us keep some real nice wild places to disappear into.   
Watch out for mouse poop in the south-west.  Could carry hanta virus and 
that is dangerous!
