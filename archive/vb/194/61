Hi List,
I had to attend an Economic Developement siminar
yesterday here in my little neck of the woods in
Oklahoma. There were congressmen, Senators, and
various other important people there. One of the press
guys attending was driving a 68 camper bus ( I know,
it's a bay window, but still way cool). I just thought
it was cool to see a member of the press show up in a
bus. There's not that many buses in Oklahoma and it
warmed my heart to see my crew cab and a bus both
parked amongst all the SUV's and Caddies and Lincolns
out there in the parking lot. Merry Christmas to all!
I love this list...

Thanks,
3DPete
