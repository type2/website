ok, the 1679 at least runs... now to jet a carb that makes it work right!

i have a 30pict1  and can get a new 30/31... what are your choices 
for mains and emulsions?

the motor is a stock stroke w/ 88s, and a VERY mild cam... at 0 lash 
its .390 lift and 248 duration intake and 254 exhaust, 108 lobe 
separation and 106 'degree intake lobe to' whatever that means :)
stock muffler adn heater boxes,  stock SP heads with some mild porting.
