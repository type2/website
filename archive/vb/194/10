Subject: Re: Hoop Quality

I've purchased four sets of Derek's hoops in the past.  I have to agree with Ronnie that the quality is great and they are super close to original.  The only *issue* I've had with Derek's hoops in the past, which he admitted to me up front in advance, is that the hoop cap ends bow forward (on the front hoop) and toward the rear (rear hoop) when they are attached to the hoop itself.  It isn't a huge deal, but it is a deal as it makes it difficult to sandwich and attach everything together (hoop, slat and cap) at the ends. It also puts stress on the canvas itself at those locations, which could shorten the life expectancy of the canvas. 

Not sure what the solution to that is during the manufacturing phase, but it's the only improvement that I think could be made.  Other than that, they're great.
