Matt,

Thanks for the list. I want to add:

Heat with torch and add parafin to free a stuck bolt. Parafin soaks right in
and lubricates.

If you want to drill it out, make sure that you drill as close to center as
possible with a small drill to make a pilot hole. Then a larger drill will
follow the pilot very nicely. The final drill size should be the tap drill
size for the bolt.

Email me the size of the bolt and I will get you the tap drill size.
