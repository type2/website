Subject: Thumb; Crewcab update; BBBVII Camping

Got to look at my thumb last Mon. for first time after accident. It's pretty
well gone from nail on, Doc put in a little alum piece to form area incase a
nail should want to grow back.  He put me off work for 4 more weeks. Got some
nice pictures of it.
Got the bonded title on the crewcab yesterday so it is now legal to drive it
if I could. Don't know when I will be able to work on it, depends on thumb.
Anyone coming to BBB that needs a bus to use/camp/sleep in at the show is
welcome to use the  magazine ( VW Trends Feb. 03 issue page 96) featured
famous "Rusting" bus for the weekend. Get a ride to Havasu and pick it up from
me or I can have it at the show. Can supply a cot for it but you will need to
provide the rest ( interior is gutted ). Email me if interested.
