I'm looking for the opposite, the cheapest ones available so that I can get
the "feel of real" until I can get the truck up to snuff enough to get the
real deal. I am also checking out for the cheapest repro for canvas also until
I get afford the real deal there also. You can always resell without taking
too big of a hit.
