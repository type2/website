Subject: re: Sheared RB bolt - clues?

I still don't know why they call it an EZ - out, it never comes out
easy. Anyway I have found that using the reverse drill bits helps alot
with your chances of getting the bolt out with the easy out. The bit
generates alot of heat and vibration and while all of that is going on
it is helping to remove the bolt instead of driving it further in. It
greatly improves your chances but does not guaranty anything.
good luck,
