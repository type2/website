You never said SP or DP but with the choice of carb I would assume SP. I would
go with 132.5 main and 55 air. And get your valve lash back to .006.

67 Single Cab, DP 1641cc 34PICT-3
71 Trike 1776cc 28/36  Pinto Progressive
VolksAir 1585cc 28 PICT

Bernoulli Interval: Do I really have enough data to draw a valid conclusion ?

ok, the 1679 at least runs... now to jet a carb that makes it work right!

i have a 30pict1  and can get a new 30/31... what are your choices
for mains and emulsions?

the motor is a stock stroke w/ 88s, and a VERY mild cam... at 0 lash
its .390 lift and 248 duration intake and 254 exhaust, 108 lobe
separation and 106 'degree intake lobe to' whatever that means :)
stock muffler adn heater boxes,  stock SP heads with some mild porting.
