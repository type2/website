Got wolves about 30 miles away at wolfhaven

http://www.wolfhaven.org/home.htm

which is a really neat place.   As far as I know, wolves don't attack VW 
buses even if the buses whine, rattle of squeak.   I was charged by an elk in 
Yellowstone Park, though.  I heard that elephants attack VW bugs though.
