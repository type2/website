Subject: Leaky RGB

I'm leaking tranny fluid out of my recently installed RGB, it seems to
be coming out of the back (towards center of vehicle) of the RGB.  Is
this a job I should tackle myself?  I don't have a gear puller as of
yet, although this seems to be a good excuse to get one.  From what I
could see tonight it looks like it's coming out on top of the spring
plate on the back of the RGB.  Does anyone have any experience with this
problem?  Thanks for any help you can provide.
