Hi Tim,
Definitely!!  Assuming this RGB was recently rebuilt and not worn out you 
will need to loosen that wheel on that RGB, jack and jack stands the bus rear 
up, with front blocked and remove that wheel and drain that RGB of gear oil.  
Remove the RGB bolts, slide the RGB to the rear of the spring plate, 
throughly degrease the surfaces of the RGB and spring plate that normally 
touch.  We apply high temp silicon sealant to the seam of all RGB plugs, 
quickly bolt the swing plate to sandwich this sealant between them and thusly 
seal the RGB plug.  This in turn greatly helps keep out water and thusly rust 
which can cause leaking down the road.
