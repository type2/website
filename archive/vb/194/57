Subject: Spongebob bus =?iso-8859-1?q?source=3F?=

Since it's Friday, has anybody found the Matchbox 5 pack of Spongebob 
Squarepants vehicles, including the Splitty? I've been looking all    
over at Wal-Mart, Toys R US, Target, and all the usual spots, but     
can't seem to find them...I can't bring myself to spend $15.00 on that
auction site for something I should be able to find for 5 bucks       
myself...                                                             
Any leads? Anybody got a couple extra sets? A friend's 5 year old is  
*really* into Spongebob, and I want to get her a set for Christmas,   
and of course, I need one for my collection as well...                
Just thought I'd ask...                                               
thanks,
