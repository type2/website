Subject: Re: [VB] Leaky RGB

sounds like a leaky plug.  If you take off the wheel  set the rear of the bus 
frimly on jackstands, remove RGBox from spring plate, you'll see the circle 
on the RGB where it sandwiched the plate, and that plug can leak if not 
sealed properly.

so clean the area thouroughly- both the back of the box, and the outside of 
the plate, and use lots of sealing goop - the silicone stuff is fine, and 
reattach (grease yr RGBox bolts)   I had this problem before.   The circle 
plug shouldn't leak, but ... you know.  One time I pulled the plug a couple 
times and messed with stuff and it kept leaking and it was a pain and I 
finally decided the inside of the circle of the box was slightly not circular 
and had score marks or something and then I just gooped the heck out of the 
space between the box and the plate and it seemed to work.

I always loosen the RGBox bolts while the bus is on all 4 feet.   And snug 
them down ditto.  Just like the lugs.

If you don't stop the leak it'll ooze until you have the tranny oil level 
pretty low.  Which is bad for your fresh rebuildt tranny.

<< I'm leaking tranny fluid out of my recently installed RGB, it seems to
 be coming out of the back (towards center of vehicle) of the RGB.  Is
 this a job I should tackle myself?  I don't have a gear puller as of
 yet, although this seems to be a good excuse to get one.  From what I
 could see tonight it looks like it's coming out on top of the spring
 plate on the back of the RGB.  Does anyone have any experience with this
 problem?  Thanks for any help you can provide.
