Hi Thom,

  Well, it depends on which bolt is sheared, the spring place must be out
of the way, and one of those right angle drills really comes in handy if
you have one.  Careful with the brake lines too!  Just see if you can get
a drill lined up exactly perpendicular to the sheared off bolt, and
nothing is in the way to remove the bolt.

Best,
