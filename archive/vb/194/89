The SVDA is a modified curve distributor taking the best from center of the
curve to fit most of the engines. I picked it because the curve picture on the
instructions showed a gentle curve from about 1000 rpm to 2700 rpm. The
plates, weights and springs are different than stock or .009 and it feels
smooth all the way up. I had a dual point .050 which I liked a lot but for my
truck, if it's not a 205, the SVDA is the one for me!

I dunno about those particular ones, but I use the distributor that
comes on an autostick '74 bug (043 905 205 A).  The centrifugal
advance is a bit less than the 009.  The one on my bus is 22 degrees
at 3500 RPM, hose plugged with the timing set at 7.5 BTDC at idle, but
the vacuum can makes up for that :-)  I like it much better than the 009.
Hesitation was history when I put it on.  I pick them up at swaps
cheap.

Just curious, do you mean that it has the same centrifugal curve as a
009 plus a vacuum can?  Isn't that a bit much or is it timed
differently?

Anyway, I love mine although it's not quite what you've got!
