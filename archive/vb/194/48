Subject: re: [VB] accessories website???  

Funny you should ask.....I just found this site tonight looking for a 
picture of a tool http://homepage.calypso.net/~ci-17825/ . Some neat stuff 
here. Nothing for sale, just scanned catalog pictures (Hazet tools, VW 
accessories, etc.) and accessory pics mostly bug though.
