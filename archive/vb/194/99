Subject: Looking for a '60 Front Beam?

Hi,

I remember someone on the list was looking for a '60 front beam, or 
parts thereof. I picked up a hand-me-down beam today. That includes 
brake backing plates, etc.

I'm tearing it down - so let me know if there is something in 
particular you need. Though I haven't pulled the arms out yet, it looks 
like it is in pretty good shape.

I'm near Austin, Texas so consider shipping before responding.

Thanks,
Conrad
