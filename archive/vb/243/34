Subject: Re: [VB] Re: I did it... swapping engines... help!

Thanks for the info and advice Matt and Eric&Barb,

What we tentatively (still haven't committed yet...) did was to swap the
Alternator/Generator from the older single port engine (out of the '63 bus,
but not original) to the '74 bug engine (dual port 1600).  The theory being
that we leave all the wiring and the voltage regulator (square box) on the
bus and not have to mess with it.  Does anyone see an issue with this?  Will
the Alternator work on the '74 engine?  It sounds like Eric&Barb prefer this
solution (leaving the wiring changes on the engine...), but I am an engine
swapping virgin and need all the re-assurance I can get.  (sorry for the
reference...  must be all those fumes from cleaning the engine compartment).

Speaking of cleaning the engine compartment, I took some pictures.  It
turned out pretty well.  I like the turquoise better than the gray the PO
painted.  Perhaps I will take it back to original when I get the dings and
dents out/replaced.   O'yah and the engine back in and running.  Here is the

Thanks for your help and patience with my newbie ways.
