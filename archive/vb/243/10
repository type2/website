Your maacos, your miracles, your schiebs...
these guys do more complete resprays than anybody. Your big time body shops
would rather
spray replacement fenders on modern cars than paint a complete vehicle.
Complete resprays are the bargain  guy's bread and butter. It's all they do
all day. I took a bug
to get resprayed at Miracle because a *real* body shop botched the first
spray.
They even filled a hole for almost nothing. If the prep is
good, it can turn out beautiful....just gotta spend more than $99.99  ;)
