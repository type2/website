Hi Paul,
The drive dog gear was used an all sorts and years of distributors.  The
vaccum can is 40 HP and later due to having a slip on hose fitting instead of
the threaded fitting on Bastard 40 HP and earlier distributors.  Also the
distributor cap clips are a flat steel instead of the Bastard 40 HP and
earlier wire clip.  Lastly the big give away is the points, that can be seen
in the Transporter Workshop Manual 1963-67, section E-9, pages 13-17,
distributor 113 905 205 B.  This is the VW built (Not Bosch!) distributor,
which according to the OLD Volks Home, Distributor Parts & Specifications, it
was one of several distributors used in 1961-64 beetle & 1960-65 bus.  It
came with a distributor cap with a nice big VW symbol cast on its top.
  So tag it with this distributor number!
