Subject: *more* hoop funkyness!

Ok, I'm starting to think these hoops weren't a bargain after all.

I noticed that they didn't look leven, front to rear.  So I measured.
The top of the front hoop is 47 3/16" from the bed, the rear is 48 3/16"
from the bed.

The front hoop is the nicer of the two, but is the one that didn't match
up with the lower hole.

Which hoop is correct?
