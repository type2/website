Sounds strange to me. I've got the Berg filter, plus a four loop cooler in
the full flow Berg-fitted case running fine with no problems since install
in 1991. My line size is whatever Berg sold me - Teflon with stainless
steel webbed outers - I believe they are fairly small (1/4"?). Maybe you
don't have enough oil in the system?
