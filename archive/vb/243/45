Subject: Hoop Question - center strap

My set of bastard hoops came with a center strap,
although I don't technically need it for a double
cab.  I thought about installing it anyway.  Is
there any reason I should *not* do this?  I'd rather
use it on the truck than put it on thesamba and have 
some Pomona whore lowball me on it.
