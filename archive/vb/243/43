In "VW Bus: The First 50 Years" by Keith Seume, there is a picture of
a "cinemabus".  It's got a screen where the back hatch would be and a
projector in the load compartment that shines on the back of the screen.
There is a light-shade or hood that extends off the back of the Bus so
people can stand or sit behind the Bus and watch the film.  The picture
you found might be something like that, although the viewing angle would
be bad for people right behind the vehicle.  Perhaps it was meant for
larger audiences that would be sitting farther away.

Another idea is that this was a promotion for a microfilm company.  I
think that in the 50s and 60s, microfilm was promoted as a good way to
store lots of information (parts catalogs, archived invoices, etc) in a
small space, since only huge companies could afford computers.  I can
see a microfilm company using these vans to promote their service while
picking up documents and dropping off film.

At any rate, I think we may have just found a vehicle that does worse
in a cross-wind than a Bus.  :)
