Subject: Proposed Eastern Washington bus gathering

List members,

I am tentativley planning a bus gathering in the Spokane, Washington area for
the weekend of September 13th.  Details are still sketchy as to where it will
be.  I was wondering how many of you fine bus drivers might consider
attending?
