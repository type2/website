Subject: RE: [VB] Full-Flow System Oil Pressure

Just from raw experience with dozens of dune buggies and performance engines,
the stock oil pump in "out of the box" configuration will deliver adequate
pressure for a stock oil system. Once you full flow you have to increase the
volume to keep your pressure up. I tried blue printing factory 26 mm oil pumps
and got good results, but they always lacked in full flow applications, mostly
because the large filters are just restrictive enough to kill the pressure. I
use blue printed Melling 30 or 32 mm pumps for full flow and I use the
filtered 30 mm pumps for non full flow apps in big blocks. You usually have to
sand down the body to get the 2 thousands max clearance with the cover on but
after that they seem to work pretty good for open engine applications like
trikes and dune buggies. I like to take my oil from the oil cooler holes and
route it to the external cooler and the oil filter. The fittings for most of
these adapters are 3/8" and I have never had a dangerous pressure drop. Plus
the oil filter slows the oil down in the cooler an additional amount of time
to extract a little more heat.

Thanks, Ray !
With the pressures I got with the 26mm pump,
what can I expect to see with a 30mm pump
in stock flow, and how much do you think I will
drop with the full-flow ? Why does it drop ?

I just don't understand why you can't get good
pressure once the lines and filter are full of oil.
I'm using steel-core high-pressure hydraulic lines,
and they are quite sturdy.

I'm not finding much information on factory
specs for oil pressure.

Without Guesswork lists a few specs for oil,
including : SAE 30,new installation, 1500 engine-
42psi at 158F (-at-)2500 rpm, wear limit 28 psi.

Bentley offers 28.5psi at 158F (-at-) 2500 rpm,
and 7.1psi engine warm, with SAE 20 oil.
I assume that is for the 1500, but not sure.
( Section M-14, page 2. )

There are specs for the oil pressure contriol
and relief spring measurements, "length loaded"
and "load" but those are too cryptic to be of any use.

I'm using an AE case, and I'm sure I'm past
the max pressures with a new engine.
I think the size of the oil return hole is limiting the effective
pressure relief back to the case from the control piston
so I am able to defeat the system even with 26mm geras.

I would like to see some specs for the 30mm pump.

Here's what John Yust reports about the 1/2" lines.
To answer his question, the Oberg oil filter is a split
cast aluminum with a 3 or 5 or 15 micron screen of
stainless steel woven wire, and has a bypass
and a dash indicator light for when it is time to clean.
It has considerably less volume than a spin-on filter.
