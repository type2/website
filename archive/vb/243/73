Subject: NEW Dropped spindles

		  Coming soon to a bus near you, BRAND NEW dropped spindles.
These are custom made from all NEW parts. These will be available with your
CHOICE of drop from 2 inchs to 4 1/2 inchs (no need for a lowered beam
anymore). The only down side so far is that they will only accept DISC
BRAKES (we are working on retaining stock drum brakes though). The projected
retail price on these will be between $1000 and 1200 dollars INCUDING new
wide 5 disc brakes!!!
