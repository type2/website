Subject: Hoop & Canvas Saga - Done!

Well, I think my hoop-and-canvas journey is at an end.

I solved the hoop fit issue at the front of the bed with a
body hammer - I just flattened the offending rib.  Tom Buese
sent me pix of his hoop, and it looked identical, so it seemed
to make sense.

The difference in height between my front and rear hoops was
actually 1 9/16" - yes - over and inch and a half.   I made a
couple of interim slats with some redwood strips I had laying
around, and fitted the canvas.  The front fit right, the rear
was way in the hell off, so I cut the difference out of the rear
hoop and re-welded.  I got lucky this time, I guess :)

The local bus guy who made my slats brought them by last
night and we installed them in the dark.  These things are
nice!  Very high quality oak, with the proper cuts on the
ends and a very nice finish - $100.  I can forward his contact 
info if anyone is interested.  (He's going to make me some bed 
slats next.)  I installed them with some 10-24 x 1 1/4" machine
screws (1 1/2" would have been better) and it looks like a 
million bucks.  I took a couple of pix on my way to work
this AM: http://vintagebus.com/gallery/61dc.html

Thanks to Wade and Tom and Greg for the help!
