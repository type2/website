Matt,

It is indeed possible that the rear wheel is tucking.  Since I love to have
interplay between video cameras and buses, I'll have someone "chase" and
shoot while I negotiate corners.

I've got bigger tires on the rear than on the front to compensate for
height.  Since it handles well in right turns, I am considering that my
problem is not due to the different tire heights/widths.

Pressure in all tires is 42....I like 'em firm.

As suggested by others on the list, I will be checking my shocks....hell,
it's been long enough...might as well replace 'em!  They are different front
to rear...

I "think" the bus is level in the rear.  What I really should do is check
that with my level, then measure the spring plate angles.  Then, I'll start
looking at tired torsion bars..


Thanks, Gene
