Subject: Anyone near Chico, CA?

Greetings, Honorable Listees. :)


I know this is a stretch, but I was wondering if there is anyone on the list 
close to Chico, CA that can inspect a prospective 57' Oval window beetle for 
me? I would gladly reinburse for your time and cost to do so. I'm in Florida, 
so this would be impossible for me to do right now. :(  Please e-mail off list, 
if interested.

Many thanks,
