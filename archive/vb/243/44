Electrically, this should work.  Mechanically, make sure the pulleys
line up (look down on the engine and the pulleys should be in a straight
line parallel to the fan shroud) and that the fan doesn't hit the shroud
(once you have the generator strapped down, but with the belt off, spin
the pulley and listen for the fan hitting something.)

>Will the Alternator work on the '74 engine?

It already did.  I think you want to ask, "will the generator work on
the '74 engine."  Your '63 engine had a generator on it, your '74
engine had an alternator on it.  Now you've put the generator on the
'74 engine.  Anyway, if the pulleys line up and the fan doesn't rub,
then yes.
