Subject: re:engine insulation

was writ:
"Was this stock or something the owner added? I thought it might be a good
idea to insulate my engine compartment while I had the engine out. Does
anyone
have any opinions on this?"

I believe this was original, i have been thinking of ways to insulate my
engine compartment, i bought some stuff from mcmaster-it is designed to
muffle
sounds, it is a kind of peel and stick foam, it comes in a sheet that is
about
4 feet wide, and as long as you want it. it has a urethane coating to protect
from grease and oil.

i already put some of this other sound deadening stuff in the engine
compartment, it is more of a mass increaser, it is also peel and stick, it is
some type of aluminum, basically it absorbs vibration type sounds, kind of
like dynamat.
