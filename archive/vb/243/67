Subject: free door panels in Bay Area, Ca

 Hey all,
I have a set of gray home made front door panels that I have taken
out of the 65 up for grabs. They have 5 inch speaker holes cut
out of them but they look ok.

Also have 1 birch door panel ( driver side I think) that I made to replace
them.
This one was the first attempt at a door panel and it came out great but
I was not happy with the final color. It fits good so if you need a template
to make
some panels of your own, come get it.

Located on the peninsula, bay area.

Larry
