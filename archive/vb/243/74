Could it be that the _left rear_ wheel is tucking in?  I haven't driven
a swing-axle VW hard enough to experience it, but this is supposed to
be the classic suspension problem of swing-axle cars (VW, Corvair).
On a sharp turn, the body rolls, the rear comes up, and the tire on the
inside of the turn wants to tuck under the car.

>(Although it has just occured to me that I should check out my rear)

How are your shock absorbers?  Stock, they would have been the same all
the way around.  With the ball-joint front I don't know what would be
best - you might find out what VW specified for the bay-window Buses.

Does the Bus sit level in the rear?  Maybe somebody adjusted the spring
plate on one side more than the other (tired torsion bar?) and changed
the spring rate on one side.

How's the tire pressure?  Stock, the fronts took a little less pressure
than the rears.  Eric&Barb like to run the same pressure all the way
around.  It's easy to "hide" suspension problems with tire pressure,
but it's something to check and possibly something to adjust if you
can't fix it another way.

You might have somebody chase you in another car while you make a left
turn so they can report what they see.  If you've got a video camera,
have a passenger in the chase car tape it so you can see for yourself.
