If you are doing the bodywork yourself and only want them to do the
"color" I suggest that you consider our old friend Earl Scheib. I had
them paint Frodo inside and 2 color outside.

Hey! Guys. 
I'm here!
I'm part of the VW Bus underworld that doesn't spend big bucks on things
that don't make it more dependable, safer or more fun to own.
I believe in running at least two different brands of tires on my bus,
bigger tires on the back.
Accepting those age freckles in my windshield safety glass.
I don't mind slamming the door twice to get it latched and I can live
with the side doors rattling.
If I get caught in a rainstorm, I pull over because I know the wipers
can't keep up.
The instrument console is too hard to remove so I estimate my speed and
fuel level at nights rather than spend two hours changing 2$ worth of
burnt out bulbs.
If something quits momentarily I don't hesitate to give it a good bump
with an open palm.
I just got this one question ............... is it worth it to have a
perfect 37 year old Van?
I think it is mean and cruel to put a VW Bus on a rotisserie, how'd you
like to be on one.
I just finished painting my bus and everybody just loves it.
