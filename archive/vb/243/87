Those 1/2" lines scare me. If I was using a blue printed 30mm oil pump I would
still not use 1/2" lines. 3/8" is as big as I will go to maintain oil
pressure.

I just completed a 1776cc DP engine
with an Engle 110 cam and headers,
complete with an Oberg 6" oil filter
and 1/2" i.d. hoses.

With a 26mm gear oil pump, I got less
than 2 psi cold cranking oil pressure.
It took far too long to barely cancel the
idiot light, and doesn't even register
on a guage at the sender hole.
The pump cover was made with
a brass 1/2" NPT fitting, it has better
flow characteristics than anything I
find on the market. All fittings are
1/2"NPT, and doesn't reduce until
it hits the case with a 3/8"NPT reducer.

Removed the filter and lines, and
changed the pump back to stock
oil path, and cold cranking pressure
went up to 20 psi, so the engine was
started, and gets 60 psi (-at-)2000 rpm, with a
stable 20 psi hot pressure at low idle.
This looks good enough for a full-flow
application, so I would like an opinion
as to how to proceed.

The 1/2" hoses are under two feet long,
and the Oberg has -8 ( dash 8, 1/2" ) fittings,
now tapped to 1/2" NPT.
I have another Oberg for the next engine
with -12 ( dash 12 or 3/4" ) fittings.
But I guess 3/4"hoses are a bit much :).
