Two people in the chase vehicle is probably better.  All the driver
should have to do is drive; let the passenger operate the camera.

Ronnie's suggestion of a bad ball joint reminded me of this: have
you put a wrench on every nut on the front suspension?  Just because
it _looks_ tight doesn't mean it _is_ tight.  Look up the torque specs
and have at it.  Even the silly stuff, like the wheel bearing end
play.  (I may be biased - I just came back from the first race of a
car built from scratch by about six semesters of college students.
We found lots of bolts that somebody was going to tighten later
and forgot.)
