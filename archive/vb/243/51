I think it was added. All of the late model busses I have seen up to 79 all
had the dark gray insulation matted with dust and road dirt held in place by
an uneven coat of oil film.

My 83 Vanagan engine lid did have a silver coated insulation though.

I was hunting for parts the other day for my bus and I saw a bay window bus
with some kind of silvery insulation on the ceiling of the engine
compartment.

Was this stock or something the owner added? I thought it might be a good
idea
to insulate my engine compartment while I had the engine out. Does anyone
have
any opinions on this?
