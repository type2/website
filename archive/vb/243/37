Subject: Westy rack found ....questions

Hi all,
I just picked up an original westy rack today for the 65 camper.
That's the good news. The bad news is it's missing 2 clamps.
It needs restoring but has the ladder attachment. I was told the 
attachment bar is original but have never seen one on a rack. Is this
an original piece?

Any chance one of you has 2 OG clamps that have been looking  
to join a family?? :) Have $$, parts or first born.

Are there any decent repro clamps out there?

Also the rack came without the wood slats. What type of wood
goes on the 63-67 racks? 

Thanks in advance,
Larry
