The markings on it are

vac can - 211 905 271A
drive dog ear - 211 905 247

Looking on the parts list makes me think it is a 36hp bus one because of the
part number on the dog ear.  Got it in a box of 3 distributors off ebay for 3
pounds (about $5) - not much use to me though as I have 66 bus with a 1600

Do you think the same

Thanks
Paul
