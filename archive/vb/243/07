Well IF you do go to Macco ask to talk to the painter(If you can speak his
language)  Offer him a $50 to do a good job and than slide it to him so that
the boss doesn't see.  Terry Wolfe did it here and his bus came out real
nice.  If the body work is good you probably can just do a Macco or Earl
Shrieb's paint job.  Don't count on it to ad value to your bus though
