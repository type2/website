innaresting.  why so?
i went and checked a handful of books on my workbench - fisher, berg 
and wilson all mention 1/2" hose or larger for remote applications 
(tho fisher is quite firm about keeping the hoses SHORT). they seemed 
more concerned with volume than pressure.

on the first AL from HELL, it did take a while to get the light out 
on cranking (plugs out, rockers off, oil in filter and hoses, pump 
primed with white grease... and i eventually loosened the oil lines 
away from the pump one by one and cranked again to bleed air before 
it would go out), but when it got going, pressure at 2k was close to 
90, idle was 40.
berg blueprinted 28mm, stainless-braided aircraft hose with an8 
fittings, bosch filter.

dave, could your filter be too restrictive?
