Subject: probable road trip/shaky front end

just a short note to let you all know, i am out in monterey, CA now, have
found a '71 squareback, and i think i am going to buy it to drive home (back
to boston).

one thing i am a little worried about is when the road curves to one side or
to the other, and you hit a bump-the front end shakes a little bit. i checked
the tie-rods, and steering damper(looks like it was replaced recently, as it
is all shiny and new looking). i took it to a local vw mechanic-he also
checked these things, he thought it was the alignment-as the drivers side
tire
had some scalloping on it...so i had the alignement work done yesterday.

but the owner says-although better, it still shakes a little. i know it is
not
a bus-but i thought you all might have some idea...

I am planning on going to pick it up on wednesday, spend thursday and friday
getting a tune-up done, and trying to determine the front end issues(ie how
major the problem is, ie can i drive it back home). i was hoping to go
through
sacramento to the show this weekend anyone else going or have any thoughts on
the show?

I will be checking the AIRS list before i go and see about meeting some list
members en route.

thanks
