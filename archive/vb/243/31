Subject: Pre 59 bus body??

I'm looking for a pre 59 bus body even if it is completely stripped, I just need a shell rolling or not. I have a '56 that is rusty that I want to find a decent body to transfer the parts to. I don't need doors, bumpers, glass or interior. Let me know what you got. Thank's for any help!
