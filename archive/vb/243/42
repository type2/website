Since you can get the starter to spin, even if it doesn't engage the
motor, the feed to the starter is probably reasonably OK.  I think
your troubles are inside the starter, like sloppy bearings or worn
brushes.  The brushes can get worn so far that they don't touch the
commutator very well, and they can also get stuck in their holders
so they don't touch the commutator at all.

Depending on the starter, you may be able to tear it down, clean it
out, polish the commutator, and get it working well enough to last
you a little while longer.  In some of them you can replace the brushes,
if you can find anybody that will sell you the brushes instead of an
entire rebuilt starter.

Another thing you might try is to clean up the three connections at
the battery (positive, negative, ground strap to body) and the two
ends of the ground strap at the front of the transmission.  If you've
got a battery charger, put your battery on it; all this starter
testing has probably drained it.  You're trying to ensure the most
voltage possible for the starter.
