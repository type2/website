Subject: Re: starter troubleshooting

Today I brought home a new starter and put it in during my lunch break, 
and I get the same situation.  Starter, or something spins, but only 
engages momentarily after I've put it in 3rd and rocked it backwards.  
Now I'm thinking maybe starter bushing is toasted, or incorrect?  Is it 
true there is absolutely no way a 6v flywheel will work with a 12v 
starter?  I don't know what flywheel it has right now.  This bus 
started and ran for a week with previous starter.  Looks like I'll be 
pulling motor to find out what's really going on.

I'll try cleaning all contacts and checking battery cables and all 
wiring again, but obviously something is wrong in the the system other 
than the starter.  One other curious thing, when I accidentally touched 
big pole on solenoid to starter body, it shot serious sparks, and 
actually made a burn mark on the starter.
