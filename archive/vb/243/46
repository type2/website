Subject: Happy 44th double cab

So, what do you get for a 44 year old double cab for it's birthday?
Well, since I recently got all the parts back for the narrowed rear end
project and I sent the transaxle off for a super diff and period correct
aluminum Crown side plate, I thought I would have Eric (my painter
friend) paint some flames on the narrowed spring plates for the double
cab. dove blue flames of course on the black plate, maybe a little bit
of pearl but I'll leave that up to Eric that likes to do flames.

 

. Flame suit on :-)
