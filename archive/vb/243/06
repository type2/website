If you are doing the bodywork yourself and only want them to do the "color" I suggest that you consider our old friend Earl Scheib. I had them paint Frodo inside and 2 color outside. She was stripped to the bone and trailered to the shop. I offered the painter a $50 cash bribe if he did the job right. The owner knew that this was not some hack job that was going to be dumped next week. Anyone that has seen her will attest to how beautiful it looks. 3 years and 20,000 miles later I have people tell me just how nice it looks. The paint has held up perfectly. I just wish I had done the body work as well as Ricardo did the paint. Just one mans opinion.
