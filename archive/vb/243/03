Motorola voltage regulator for a 70s Bug.

Mating connector for the above regulator.  Three of the wires go
to the alternator and one is also the warning light connection.

This is the round plug that goes on top of the alternator.  The
alternator has three push-on connections on three sides of a
sqaure.

Another shot of the mating connector.  The blue wire is for the
warning light.

Sure enough, the regulator matches the connector in pictures 2 and 4.
