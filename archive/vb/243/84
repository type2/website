Subject: starter troubleshooting (update)

Ok, so I pulled the motor in the 60 dc, and discovered what I had 
feared.  109 tooth flywheel very chewed up, 12v starter bushing 
allowing starter to wiggle all around.  I didn't have a 12v flywheel 
handy, but I did have the 6v to 12v bushing here, so I put it in, 
popped motor back in, and it started right up, and actually sounded 
normal.

Today, I drove it 3mi to dmv, had a vin check done (just checked behind 
passenger seat), paid my dues, and it is now fully tagged and 
registered.  Ct is in the process of switching safety inspections over 
from public to private sector, and currently has no safety inspection 
program for vehicles under 18,000 pounds.  Now that I have it 
registered, it is time to tear it down to skin and bones, but not 
before a couple of dump runs.  I know this is bass ackwards, but it 
took me over a year to get another bus registered because of over 
zealous safety inspection officers.  (ex.  front side markers didn't 
light up on my 71 westy.  They are just reflectors!, They wouldn't hear 
of it, and failed me on the spot)  So now I can relax, and take my time 
with this one, and probably keep it a running work in progress.

I temporarily ran some speaker wire under the bus to get my oil + gen 
lights working, and now all is well in the speedo, 'cept that damn 
blinker light.  Stays on (key turned)  and then blinks when + power is 
applied, does nothing when ground is applied.

I think I'm getting real close to the point where I turn the corner, 
and can start answering some questions :)
