Hi Volks,
We have seen the same repair done with an old W8AC spark plug threaded into 
this hole!  Just make sure you do not try to hook a spark plug wire there!

We tend to leave the original body wiring as much as possible alone and make 
wiring changes on the engine.  That way later on if you switch engine again 
you can do so without having to reconvert the body wiring back to original.
