Subject: RE: [VB] 8mm square socket-shift coupler

wow, what memories....
I squirted my grub screws with a little lube and tried to un due the
coupler.  Both twisted in two instantly.  The proceeding events went worse
as I tried to drill them out but the limited space I had to work in (the bus
was on typical jack stands) made everything more difficult... still no luck.
I tried to grind the coupler in two, the right angle grinder couldn't reach
in... I tried a dremel, that worked until it caught on fire (it was an older
one).  Finally, I sawed the front shift rod at the base of the coupler.  I
searched for quite a while to find another front shift rod to use as a
pattern in order to fix my original.  From start to finish... 9 months(!)
... many lessons learned; 'patience', 'get the bus up in the air!', more
patience, etc.  :-)
