What's the general deal after you break them?  Do you have to cut and weld a
new linkage in?  I noticed that my shift linkage has been cut twice already?
Can you get new/used shift linkages?  From who?  

Thanks for the response in advance!

if you cant get them of with anything other than a square socket,
you are probably going to snap them off.
better to soak for a few days in penetrant oil
and try heating them to loosen
if you gotta put that much torque on them to loosen its no good try the oil 
and heat first before you breakem.
