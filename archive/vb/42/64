Subject: yes on mystery diz!

I took the mystery vac/mech dizzy on a 50 mile spin (to the VWFLAPS,
floorpans ordered) and am really pleased. Throttle is more responsive,
and I can maintain speed or even accelerate uphill where I used to sit
by helpless as the speedo slowly slipped. The engine even sounds like
it is doing less work, but this must be in my head. Whatever, I am
well pleased. The oil temp is just slightly higher, maybe 5 degrees,
maybe a good thing because despite heat risers, thermo and flaps, the
bus mostly ran on the 1 of 120, now it is running at the 0 of 120. I
haven't driven it enough to tell whats up with the gas mileage, but
certainly it has not gone looney excessive because I would have
noticed that.
Got the last parts to put the proper bus exhaust on (bye-bye empi
thing), will do that once I gain more confidence in the new used
dizzy.
Congrats to you Arizona types, see you next year?
