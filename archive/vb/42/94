Go to Wal Mart and buy some mini bungee cords, they come about four to a
pack, then head over to the shower curtain area and pick up a nice heavy
cloth shower curtain, you can string the cords alongside the windows and
trim the curtain to length, then you can string cords from the fresh air
plenum to either side of the bus behind the front seat and hang your curtain
on the cords.
good luck
