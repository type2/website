Finding the correct size reamer for your application will probably be
harder, and not cheap.  Adjustables are cheaper..I recall harbor wait has
a cheap set of'm that I think has the size needed. 75 bucks or so.

I used an adjustable when i did my center pin...my boss had a set sitting
on the shelf next to his lathe and let me borrow them.   I didnt do a
perfect job, though....the reamer tapers from one end to the other, and
the bigger end is your final size.  Since the thing was longer then the
amount of space between the bottom of the pin and whatever is above it
that i hit, I ended up opening the reamer more, to get the higher portions
open till i could get the pin in. Not a perfect job, and it will probably
wear out prematurely. ah well. Hell of a lot better then it was though. :)


Or, you may start calling around to local machine shops (yellow pages..)
and asking them if they have a hand reamer in the size you need...you may
find someone who actually has metric ones! :)

Then a: see if you can rent the tool from them (perhaps offering to leave
a full-price-of-tool deposit/CC#), or ...

b:  take the bus, and the bentley, to them, and offer to pay them the 1-2
hrs labor for /them/ to do the job.

The bushings /must/ be reamed after the are installed...this is to size
them to fit, and to remove any metal that deformed into the pin area
during installation. Doing it before hand at the very least will likely
cause you to have to do it again...at the worst, will perhaps cause them
to be to large once installed.


or. c:  pay'm a bit more, and have them come out and ream them onsite.

close aproximation?)
