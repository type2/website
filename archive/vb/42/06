But guys, I like that extra bounce! :-) It's kinda like the bounce when
this old bus goes over one of those dips in the road that are marked with
a 'bump' sign. Actually, the extra bounce is usually to line up the next
hole on the nut. The gland nut gets mindful tightening, no bouncing. 

So, even though I'll continue to use the anti-sieze goop on all fasteners,
what do you guys think of it - it's been an interesting point of
discussion for decades.
