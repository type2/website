Subject: trying mystery dizzy

The mystery dizzy (probably for mid-70's 1600 bug, but MT, AT, FI who
knows) is in the bus and seems to be working. I am going to wait until
daylight tomorrow for the proper road test, when rescue is easier to
manage, but it starts, idles and advances. How far should it advance?
The only dizzy I've used this far is the 009, I am used to timing it
by making the maximum advance 30 degrees, which gives me about 7.5
BTDC at idle. This is what I tried to do with the mystery diz, I am
now at just shy of 30 degrees at 2600 rpm,  and about 10 degrees BTDC
at about 850rpm idle. Would these numbers indicate a properly
functioning vac/mech advance dizzy? Timed about where it should be? I
don't have a good enough understanding of timing to feel that
confident. Clearly it is advancing, but the overall advance is less
than the 009. The vacuum arm does advance if I suck on the vacuum
inlet, but testing it plugged/unplugged while running didn't occur to
me until just now.
Thanks,
Joel
