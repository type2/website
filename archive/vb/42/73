Subject: Re: [VB] 8mm square socket-shift coupler

Why on earth would you cut the linkage, I had them snap even with the square
head socket and just cut the coupler off.  It took a while even with the air
saw.  Then replaced the coupler and called it a day.  Why not be patient and do
it right the first time.  Good luck on finding new/ used linkage, as you have to
find somebody parting one who hasn't hcked through it already.  Took me a while
on the old '65.
