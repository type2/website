Subject: DD "hack"

I know...touchy subject. Gonna ask anyway though. I'm not doing 
anything right now, I'm just talkin'. So don't bother with the "don't 
do it's" and such. Tune out if you don't want to talk.

A buddy and me were hanging out and shooting the sh*t. We got to 
talking about Double Door busses and how one would go about doing a 
DD hack. For discussion sake, I was wondering if anyone on the list 
here has done one or has got a good look at one that was done.

Did you/they use a section out of a RHD bus or DD bus and work it in? 
Or did you/they use LHD parts and do a little creative welding? Seems 
like most of doing the hack is pretty cut and dry. Just welding in 
the "lip" around the inside of the new doorway and doing the outer 
cargo floor and maybe rocker. Of course accomodating for the door 
hinges as well.

What we were wondering is, when you cut away the window section if 
the structure channel, is it exactly the same as the stock cargo door 
side? In other words, is it "closed in" on the side all the way from 
top to bottom like the one that's there already? Don't know if that's 
clear. This looked like the only thing that we couldn't figure out in 
our assesment of using regular LHD cargo door parts.

I've looked at Rob's australia DD mod on his website here:
http://users.pipeline.com.au/hoopty/23_DD_conversion.htm .

It only shows finished product and doesn't tell how he did it. I'd 
love to see more DD mods. I really enjoy looking at stuff like this 
when it's done (IMO) "right". His looks good. Anyone else got 
pictures?
