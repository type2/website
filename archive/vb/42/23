Hi Raymond,
Go out and find your local Proto tool dealer and buy the 3/4" drive L-shaped 
breaker bar of thier's.  So far we have used this with a 8' long cheater bar 
on a tranny with rusted and probably overtorqued nuts with no more than 
slight flexing of the breaker bar with Eric's 200 lbs. wieght hanging off the 
end!  Cost is about $35.00 for one of these Proto breaker bars.  As for the 
sockets we have had no problems with Craftman ones, but thier 3/4" breaker 
bar is junk and still costs about $30.00.   Eric&Barb
