Subject: Powdercoat colors for bumpers

Hi list!

Checked the archives, and although there has been considerable 
discussion about powdercoating bumpers, etc. I couldn't find any 
conclusion as to the closest correct color.

The contenders seem to be Traffic White (RAL 9016) and Signal White 
(RAL 9003).  Does anybody have an opinion as to which is closest to 
the original color?

Thanks
