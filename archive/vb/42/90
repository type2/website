Hmm?  Are you talking about the number in that range that is generally
associated with the cam gear?  I always thought that number indicated
a slightly different cut on the cam gear teeth, or very slightly
different cam gear diameters.  The idea was that the engine builder
would select a cam gear for the engine to minimize backlash and make
the gear run smoothly.  I think the differences come from the 
difference between the cam and crank centerlines (ie the bearing holes
in the case); they are probably pretty well parallel to one another,
but the cam and crank centerlines might not always be exactly the
same distance apart from case to case.  It doesn't have anything to
do with the cam timing; it just provides for smooth running of the
gears. 

There are adjustable cams and gears where you can twist the gear
relative to the cam to alter when the valve timing happens.  I don't
know that these are used much on VWs; I *think* they are more common
on engines like small-block Fords and Chevies where you don't have
to tear the engine down very far to get to the cam gear.

I hear that the Strength-through-Joy Car Factory sold about 1.8
million of their part no. 211 109 021 for split-window Buses and
that cam performed pretty well.  :)
