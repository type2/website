Subject: Bushing Reaming question

OK, I have decided to try to replace the center pivot bushings and pin on the '66.  I have read the info in the type2.com library and on Thoms vintagebus site.  I THINK I can handle everything except maybe the reaming of the new bushings, my questions refer to this.  First of all, is a reamer a standard tool I can pick up at my local Home Improvement Warehouse for relatively cheap, or is it a specialty tool taht will cost me big bucks and be hard to find (are they electric or hand driven?) Question 2: Has anyone taken the pin and bushings to a machine and have them ream them before installation, if so, how did this work for you??
