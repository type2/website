Subject: Throwout bearing Q

I just received a 111 141 165A a throwout without the plastic ring, just a
ball bearing. Am I far better off with the 111 141 165 C ? I assume since
it's 64 up to have it anyway, I am using an older part if I use this, and my
clutch might be noisy. Looking for durability foremost...
TIA
Al
