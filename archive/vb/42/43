Subject: RE: [VB] Clutch op shaft Q-DONE! 66 DLX progress report brake bleed Q

Volks,
I used the brass bushing. Def do this, it is SO much more sturdy. Had to
sand the zinc off the other end of the recond throwout shaft to make the
clearences right, and regroove the clip grovves to make a better secure fit.
The coiled spring clips fit well, and I used grease on all pivot areas,
inlcuding throwout bearing notches. Safety wire will be used, I assume it
goes through the clip look and then behind the throwout bearing pip/tube the
clip goes in? A smal notch/groove could be considered there. Not doing this
too tight, as it might bind up the bearing pivotig, just to secure the
clips.
After a brake adjustment, bleed, engine seal installs, I am ready to install
the engine, break her in, and drive her!
Question is it safe to bleed before adjustment, or do I risk send ing a
piston out of the cyl? Don't want to do that.
Can't wait to use that GL4 I finally tracked down at a NAPA with a
knowledgeable guy behind the counter. It seems that one in three NAPAs have
one... :)

Hi AL,
The brass bushings were original to the pre-1968 VWs and alot better than
the
later/aftermarket thin potmetal/plastic ones.  The coiled ended spring clips
work much better than the U-shaped ones.  The best and easiest safety wire
you can get for this and those shifter linkage square headed bolts is wire
used for tying steel reinforcement rods in concrete pouring and can be found
at most any hardware store!
