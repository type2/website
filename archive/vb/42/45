A really short 8mm open end wrench works really well. Also allow for careful
tightening. I soaked em in oil two days prior, no problems.

Subject: [VB] 8mm square socket-shift coupler


Hi. I am trying to remove the shift coupler from my '62 crew cab without
mangling the screws any worse. They are the 8mm square-head screws. I know
snap-on makes an 8mm square socket, but I was wondering if anyone else did?
I can't seem to find any other places that have them, and I can't get
snap-on to come by my house.
:)
 I know you can use a 12 pt socket, but these bolts are already starting to
round out, and I don't want to make them worse. Any leads appreciated.
