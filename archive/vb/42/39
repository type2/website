What's always worked for me (so far) is to get a
"Jorgensen" clamp for woodworking.  (I used to be a
cabinetmaker and already had one.)  It's a clamp made
of two pieces of wood with two screw handles running
between them.  (See

Just get the glass ready, and slowly tighten the clamp
to push the glass and rubber into the slot.
