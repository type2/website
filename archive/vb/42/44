Subject: 8mm square socket-shift coupler

Hi. I am trying to remove the shift coupler from my '62 crew cab without mangling the screws any worse. They are the 8mm square-head screws. I know snap-on makes an 8mm square socket, but I was wondering if anyone else did? I can't seem to find any other places that have them, and I can't get snap-on to come by my house.
:)
 I know you can use a 12 pt socket, but these bolts are already starting to round out, and I don't want to make them worse. Any leads appreciated.
