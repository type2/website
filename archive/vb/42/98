Perhaps you tuned the engine with the tube pressing the throttle slightly
and now idle is too low?

My bus has begun dying at stop signs, and sometimes, when I take my foot off
the accelerator to go around a corner or just slow down the engine dies.
This is a relatively new situation, always before it idled very well.
The problem started when I discovered that the tube which carries the
accelerator cable through the fan shroud had become displaced and was
pressed up agains the carbuerator linkage. I moved the tube back to its
correct place, but now I'm experiencing the problem above.
Any tips?
Thanks in Advance
John Flowers
