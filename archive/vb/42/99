[...]

You don't say what engine you have or what carb.  Could be somethng
like the air fuel mixture adjustment for the carb idle circuit.  This
may have been overridden by the binding linkage.  Now that you fixed
the linkage, the carb may be responding to its idle circuit as is
normal.  My guess but I could be wrong since I don't know what you
have.
