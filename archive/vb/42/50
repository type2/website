Subject: RE: [VB] oil filler neck never tight

>i can tell every time it comes off because my compression goes to sh*t.
what would cause this? 

Compression has nothing to do with the oil filler tube...  I have no idea
what else you would be referring to?

>do i have to tighten up my generator tie-down to keep the generator stand
from jiggling so much? or is there a lock washer that is supposed to go in
there? another issue. 

The generator clamp/o-ring thing should be tight and allow no movement of
the generator at all.

>has anyone found a good tool to tighten down the fastener for the oil
filler neck? the best thing i've found is a 1 1/2" wide paint scraper, but
there has to be something better than that. thanks again for all your help. 

The VW rags and all our friendly list vendors should be able to get you the
specific tool to do the job right.  The tool should be under $10 if I
remember right.
