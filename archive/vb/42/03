"NEW" parts mean nothing these days..They ALL MUST be checked, decked,
matched, fluffed and buffed before you can assemble anything in a manner of
blueprinting. The standards of the mexican, and brazian factorys really
suck, especially with the oil system. That sorry little oil pickup tube in
the new cases must be tossed if you want any oil volume....
