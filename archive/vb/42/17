Subject: Weatherstrip replacement

I almost to the point in my restoration of my '67 Camper where I need to
replace all of the rubber and weatherstripping.

I've done this on a couple of bugs, but never on a type 2.  Are there
any secrets, or things I should be careful about?  The thing that
appears to be the hardest is replacing the weatherstripping around the
windwing glass, and around the pop-out glass.  Anyone got a secret for
getting the windwing glass out of the frame without damaging the frame?
I suppose I'll have to remove the old rivet holding the windwing in
place on top, and replace it somehow when I have replaced the rubber
around the glass of the windwing, and around the frame?  Any
suggestions, comments or sources of info would be greatly appreciated.
