7.1:1 is just too low, even for a bus.

I set 90% of our bus engines at 7.5 or 7.7 according to the year and weight
of the application.

Adding any shims WILL change rocker geometry, infact ANY change including
the flycutting of heads will change the rockers.

A single port head is tough, give it enough CR to give it more power and
clean up  the exhaust emissions. I'm not saying to take it super high, but
my magic number has been 7.%:1, and that normally comes with no shims,
correct 211 pistons, and a 50cc head.

We have no problems with this and the engines run just as cool as with super
low CR.
