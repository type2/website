Gee, I guess that couldn't have had anything to do with the rebuilder,
installer, or proper break-in could it?  Where did he get the engines from?

Just to be a grumpy young man (32). Exactly how is that type 4 better? My
friend has a 72 and he has replaced his motor 4 times. No the type 4 is
expensive and breaks down more. It just sucks. Period.
