Subject: Re: [VB] Flasher Relay help needed

When VW went from 6V to 12V they dispensed with the two seperate
flasher relays and went with the "9-prong box." That is why you may be
having trouble finding the right flasher relay in 12V. I think there
is an article in the type2 library all about the 9-prong box and how
to make one.
Good luck,

I've solved all the electical stuff wrong with the 65, except for one
thing.
The indicator lights in speedometer do not blink for a left turn.  My
bus
has the emergency flasher switch and red light, and was converted to
12
Volt.  In the 65 wiring diagram, the relay seems to have three prongs
plus
ground.  The one currrently in there (aftermarket) has three prongs,
but no
apparent ground.  I've checked all catalogs, but don't see any relays
listed
for 65 with emergency flasher.

What should it look like, or have on it?  Any ideas?  BTW, out of
curiosity,
should the indicator lights be blinking for right turn without key in
start
position?

 Thanks in advance
