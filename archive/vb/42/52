I have had the same problem with mine....... after cleaning that channel I
have spotted a few small holes. After a good cleaning I bought a small gas
welder "set-up" at Menards ($40.00) and used it to fill the "bumps" and
holes with copper - it's called brazing. In my opinion it is the cheapest
and yet probably the best for the money alternative to replacement of that
channel. You can also use this set-up for light welding of sheetmetal and
for cutting. 1 can of Oxygen will not last long but you can also use
Mapp-Gas and get more done. Practice makes perfect. I have used my MIG
welder a bit but nothing beats Gas welding.

Good luck,
