Subject: Curtains

Winter should be setting in here sometime in the next month. I've got 
my heater working, but would like to hang some curtains between the 
cab and the cargo area of my '59 Kombi (bench seat). I bought some 
good material today from a place that was going out of business. 
So....

Can anyone send suggestions on how to hang curtains between the cab 
and cargo area as well as on the side cargo windows of my bus? What 
kind of DIY stuff works the best? Pictures? I want solutions I can go 
and buy at WalMart or the hardware store or something. I'm not 
interested in hunting down Westy stuff or anything. So lowbuck DIY 
stuff would be great.
