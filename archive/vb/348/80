of course, the big problem is this:

most collectible insurance means NO DRIVING EXCEPT TO/IN PARADES!  so 
much for your daily driver.
and i have no confidence that this isn't a  back door to eliminating 
exemptions for any car EXCEPT designated collectibles.

plus, who gets to define collectible - pacers are now desirable of 
all things (to a SMALL fanbase); but i bet they won't be officially 
sanctioned.

frankly, a straight 25-year rolling exemption w/ a proviso that it 
meets standards of the day (proper or EQUIVALENT smog equipment) is 
the only logical way. which, since the ACTUAL goal is to force you to 
buy a newer car, NOT reduce pollution, means it will never 
happen...................
