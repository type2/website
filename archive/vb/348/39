Archive and library http://www.type2.com/library/fuel/jetss.htm says
Mikuni - try a Japanese bike place.  Ronnie at Old Volks said he stocked
Solex jets, but that was a few years ago.

I don't know the answer to this.  I would suggest reading
http://www.type2.com/library/fuel/jettype.htm and looking at page 22 of
the '73 Without Guesswork at http://failsure.net/oacdp/ for the late
Bus engines.  The numbers there are for a 1700 but they will be in the
direction of what you need.  Maybe multiply the stock jet sizes by
1914/1700 and see what you get?  You might also look at the Solex manual
on that site for more advice.
