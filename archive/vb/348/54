I don't have my bus nearby to go check, but from memory, the first switch
to the right of the steering column is the light switch, then the
emergency flasher switch, which doesn't use the extra mounting hole. It
could be possible that your bus is supposed to mount the lighting switch
over at the hole with the screw hole. Who knows? The whole hole thing
sounds strange to me. I recall on my '64, it was the same way as on my 67.
