Subject: [WetWesties] Update:  I'm home from Palm Desert


Thank you to everyone for encouragement. Your e-mails DID help me.

This is short, just to say I and my 71 westy are safely HOME!
although we are both 'disabled' . ie I am thoroughly worn out.  The
full story involves many, many  hours of delay and aggro with AAA,
but of course the fault is mine -well possibly- for ruining the
engine. We'll  use our bikes and the public busses for a few days and
then deal with it all, and maybe send another update.  As I was towed
back into LA the sunset was glorious, a cup of tea and a biscuit was
waiting
thanks again
-Olive
