First, I'd like to find out where you tracked down "preheat flap delete"
as a description of M-Code 002.  I've been looking for a list with 002
on it for years.  The reason for that is that I have been collecting the
NEATO Old Bus Registry for about ten years and I've not seen any list to
decode 002.  Not my "Parts List".  Not Dave Eccles' "Spec Guide".  And
none of the various web pages I've been to.

What I can confirm and clarify is the date.  The NEATO Registry has 112
buses with 002 on the production plate.  The earliest is chassis
255.010.109 (02 AUG 64) and the last one is chassis 256.175.773 (very
late 1966 model).  There's no relationship to model I can tell based on
the occurrence by model:

21 (Panel) = 11
22 (Standard) = 17
23 (Kombi) = 35
24 (Deluxe) = 7
25 (Deluxe 7) = 19
26 (Pickup) = 13
28 (Standard 7) = 8
Unknown model = 2

I can add that for the 110 buses for which I have documented 002, all
were shipped to the USA (based on a port code starting with 'U').  Since
I'm in the US and most NEATO members are in the US, about 80% of the
buses I know of were shipped to the US.  However, I have no buses
shipped to ports outside the US or delivered in Germany with 002. 

Whatever 002 is, it appeared to go away for the 1967 model.  Since I
have three 1967s, I can't just go look at mine for a reference.  I guess
we need someone who can look at a '65 or '66 next to an earlier model to
see what flap disappeared.
