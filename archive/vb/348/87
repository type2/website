Glad to see Chris George got a couple honorable mentions by
roamingwesty!

"...And then there's my 
friend Chris George out of Vegas waiting for us.
...        [and furthermore]         ...
Chris George, being an authentic French chef, hauled out
like 10 pounds of clams and mussels, and started cooking
them with seasonings from scratch. ..."

If you see him again, you tell him that the Chili cookin'
(er, I mean eatin') fool from TN say, "Hey BUUUUU-dy!"  and
that, by golly, I've lost his instantmailafucation address.
 (really draw out the Buuuuuuu-dy part)
