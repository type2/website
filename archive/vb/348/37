OK, I just search type2.com and got all the witty remarks about the fire 
Single, etc.
If anyone replied *directly* to me with some serious help please do so 
again....

Ronnie, I would buy your Single (as I've stated before) if you'd send me 
some better pictures that aren't 2 years old taken from 60 feet away....
I'll take Sean (Gus actually) up on his offer, wire you the money have 
them drive it back for me...

No need to finish a Bus for Shasta then..

Greg
