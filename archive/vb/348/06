Subject: e brake cable lengths

I need to find a source for cable length differences throughout the years.
My problem, I working on a '66 that has the earlier style e brake handle 
where the cables attach under the Bus instead of coming up through the 
floor. The regular 64 - 67 cables end up about 203 mm (8 inches) to long.

Thanks in advance,
Greg
