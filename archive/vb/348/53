Subject: manual choke

So ... I'm kinda familiar with a 28 PICT but that's about it.  Anyway - I have
a 30 PICT? carb with a manual choke - it has a place for a wire about in the
spot where the wire for the auto choke goes - where should that connection go?
To the coil where the wire from the distrib connects?

TIA
