Before LeeRoy Blackwood of Knight's Auto Parts died (bless him, my bus would
not have ever gotten restored and on the road without his almost daily help)
he told me to re-jet my Kadrons and to go to a motorcycle shop and buy the
right ones. I did that but it was years ago and I have lost them. Does anybody
know what he was talking about? What motorcycle jets were they?

 I know that when I pull the carbs and take out the jets they will have a
number on them, what is the correct number for my 1914cc dual kadrons 78.4x88
with a mild cam? I have no reduction boxes and I have a 412 ring and pinion
trans from a 68(?) bug.

I did not build this engine, but I did the rebuild and I am pretty sure of all
those numbers.

I know just enough to be a problem for myself.
