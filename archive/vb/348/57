Have your battery load tested. It could also be a bad connection is the
system and pass a small amount of power but not pass alot of current when
asked to. Clean all connections between the positive battery terminal and
fuse block, light switch and Ignition switch. Don't forget the negative
cable and trans to body bond strap.

Need a little help with my electrical system. Its a 12 volt converted '65
Bus that has a dead electrical system. The battery checks out at 12 volts
and I have 12 volts going to the fuse box and to the headlight switch and to
the ignition switch. When I turn the key, the whole system loses voltage.
