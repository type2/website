Subject: Re: [VB] Shift rod

I blasted the pitted/rusted areas & then painted mine with Rustoleum flat 
black paint, installed the bushings with some grease on them and called it 
done.

My concern was if I greased the whole rod that dust and debris would cling 
to the thing and make a big mess.

I didn't want the rod to rust anymore and wasn't gonna put it back in 
without some paint. I don't trust the grease alone to keep it from rusting. 
And I had such a terrible experience with the shift rod in my single cab I 
never wanted it to happen again. It was rusted to the shiftrod tube and I 
made a big mess getting it out. Ended up having to find a replacement 
shiftrod.

I know this isn't the "book" way to do it, but I think it's gonna work 
better for me.
