Subject: Why don't I just buy a Honda Element?

Of course I know why, because an Element can carry my stuff, but it has no
soul. But sometimes I get frustrated.

I am at the end of the whole rip-out-the-wiring-and-install-the-new-harness
and after all that I am ready to get in and drive away, but wait, there's
more!

As I am trying to install the new vintage headlight switch I find that it is
held in place by a small screw at the bottom of the switch. Well, there is no
corresponding hole under the dash. And I could drill a hole, but no! When the
switch is in place there is no metal there.

There is no question here, just complaining to folks with a common
happiness/misery. Something always seems to come along to add a day to the
project, or a week, or a month, or...
