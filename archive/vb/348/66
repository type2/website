Hi Jdd,
Could be the points corroded while sitting.  Remove them from the distributor 
and sand them flat and clean.  DO NOT sand them in the distributor because 
sand will come loose and end up in the distributor.  This for the distributor is 
akin to you being forced on a march with sand in your pants....
  Could also be the condensor is bad.
