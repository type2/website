Subject: Re: [VB] manual choke

This is the carb that Clara installed in her 65 a while ago - manual choke -
but there is an electrical connection on it - maybe for the 12V idle jet?
I'm wondering where that wire should go to - coil?

I've been having trouble getting my bus started.  It hasn't run in about a
year.  I just noticed that wire on the carb isn't hooked up - think that
could be my problem?

TIA
