Subject: FS - Time-Sert kit , 12mm x 1.5

I bought a Time-sert kit last spring to fix my RGB's.  I used the kit to repair my boxes, but it is still like new & includes some of the long inserts .
 
I'd like to get $50 for it shipped witin the US.  I paid $70.
 
e-mail me if you are interested,
 
Thanks,
 
Matt
