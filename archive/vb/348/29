OK, we're going to head our soggy buses over to Havasu, in search of sunny
skys and balmy breezes!

Anyone who would like to drive with us is welcome to join in!  We are
driving at typ1-powered baywindow speeds (60MPH).  We will meet at the
Pines Cafe on the Pearblossom highway between the 14 freeway and CA 138
for a delicious breakfast like this:

Meeting time is 7:15AM!

Here's a map:

We will then head out to Lake Havasu via CA 138 to I-15 to I-40, etc.

We're using FRS radios on channel 2.
