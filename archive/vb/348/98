Subject: re: dash switches

The switches on my dash(which I believe are in the original location) from
left to right...

Windshield wipers (steering wheel) head light, emergency flasher.

There is a red light above the windshield wiper switch...which I never
understood. Why isn't the emergency flasher switch under the light? Was it
originally?

Subject: Remember the headlight switch in the dash problem?


So on my '63 Sundial (which started life as a delivery/cargo van) the holes
in the dash, from left to right are: the emergency light switch (the light
is directly above), the steering column, a hole that was the light switch
but is now a switch for a heater fan, the headlight switch, the windshield
wiper switch.
