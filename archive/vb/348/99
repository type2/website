Subject: Shift Rod Coupling wanted.

Any one know where I could source a new Shift Rod Coupling?   (The rear one 
that connects the shift rod to the tranny.)   Mine is shot on my 65 Double Cab 
work truck and I cannot find one listed for split window busses anywhere.  Any 
help would be appreciated as mine is currently held together with hose clamps 
and wire.
