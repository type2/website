Need a little help with my electrical system. Its a 12 volt converted '65 Bus that has a dead electrical system. The battery checks out at 12 volts and I have 12 volts going to the fuse box and to the headlight switch and to the ignition switch. When I turn the key, the whole system loses voltage. I tried to isolate the problem by by passing the headlight switch but I get the same results. I even tried hot wiring by bypassing both the headlight switch and the ignition switch but with not result. What to do, what to do? Any ideas?

Thanks,
