Hi Jim,
First try cleaning the carb by dissassembly, complete going through, and new 
rebuild kit.  While apart take notes of what size jets used.  Check jet sizes 
against the 1971 bus jet sizes in the "Without Guesswork" manual in the "Part 
Manuals" you research through on the Vintagebus.com website.
  Also if you have the auto fuel shut off solinoid do you have it connected 
electrically to allow idle RPM fuel?
