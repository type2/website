Subject: Re: [VB] Can't set idle

Hello Jim  Just because the carb looks new doesnt mean it is new  could be 
one of the cheapo reman units that arent worth a crap.. Right below thw choke is 
an idle jet unscrew this jet and see if it will idle then. could be some junk 
in the idle circuit  also use carb cleaner to check for vacuum leaks at the 
manifold and crosshaft of the carb ,   later and have fun  mark dearing
