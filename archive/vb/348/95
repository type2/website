Subject: Progress on the 21 Window

Visited the body shop today to deliver some metal and some cargo doors for my
21 window.  So far the bus has been in the shop for over a week and all but 3
skylight windows are finished, front windshield frames are done, extra holes
welded up, a piece of the lower front nose patched, and a few other things as
well.  It is really starting to take shape and the work is perfectly fine.

I got a good line on a nice dogleg and lower B-pillar and hope to have that
here soon and get it welded in.

I did realize one thing after taking a look at my kombi cargo doors and the
deluxe/standard doors.  The front door has an extra plate spot welded in two
spots and the rear door has a metal strip for the headiner.  Should be SIMPLE
to convert.

The one last thing I would like to find is a nice donor cargo floor.  12" deep
from the rocker edge.  If anyone has one, email me.

I'm not going to make the bus super purty, just going to get the body solid,
prime, seal and spray a semi flat coat on her so I can actually have a friggin
car again.  : )

Thanks to everyone on here that has helped.

I should have pictures up soon on The Samba.
