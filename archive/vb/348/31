Hello Gloria,

Welcome to the club! I've had my 67 for almost 32 yrs now, did a major
restoration in 94-95 at a shop in W. LA. I'm in San Francisco now. You're
really close to many resto parts specialists. I highly recommend:

Wolfsburg West - Corona
Vintage Parts - Glendale

Both of the above offer great parts and personalized service.
