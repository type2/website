    I drove the SC down to the event site today, dam choke sticks. Started right up after setting a year in my warehouse. Will take a ton of pics 
and get them up tomorrow or is it today for all to see as I am sure a few others will also. Sure get a shitload of looks driving it around.
    Yesterday a new Excursion caught on fire in front of my shop and after I called 911 and helped the lady get her 4 kids out of it I went and 
got the fire truck and drove it over to the where the fire was, the local FD got a real kick out of it as did the little kids who were in the SUV.
