Subject: Shift rod

I pulled my shif rod out of the tube on the '61 panel yesterday to replace rod
bushings and dust boots. The rod was in good shape, just a little rusty on
each end. One of the bushings (in the middle) had broken loose and was sliding
free. The other bushing, towards the front, was still in place but worn.

Here is my plan. Sand off the rust. Replace the plastic bushings, put a coat
of grease on the tube and replace. I noticed that on the front of the rod
there are two set screw holes 180 degrees apart and on the rear of the rod
there is one set screw hole. This is the way it came out, with one bushing
attached towards the front of the tube and the other in the middle.

Since I couldn't find much talk in the archives or Muir's book on the subject
I have a couple of questions. Is it possible to reinstall this rod improperly
so that it won't shift right when I get the transaxe and engine back in? Is
there a reason these rods aren't painted, at least on the ends where most of
the rust was?
