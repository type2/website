Are you using a "known good" battery. Just because a 12v battery 
measures 12v in a no-load state, that doesn't mean it is good. The 
battery would be my first focal point.

Need a little help with my electrical system. Its a 12 volt converted 
'65 Bus that has a dead electrical system. The battery checks out at 
12 volts and I have 12 volts going to the fuse box and to the 
headlight switch and to the ignition switch. When I turn the key, the 
whole system loses voltage. I tried to isolate the problem by by 
passing the headlight switch but I get the same results. I even tried 
hot wiring by bypassing both the headlight switch and the ignition 
switch but with not result. What to do, what to do? Any ideas?
