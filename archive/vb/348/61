Hi Jdd,
If there is a auto shut off pliot/idle jet, it would be on the left side of 
the carb.  Thing is that if the carb ran before without an electrical 
connection there than it should work now.

More likely you need to take the carb aprt for a full cleaning and give the 
engine a complete go over and tune up.
