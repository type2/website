Subject: Re: [VB] manual choke

Hi Jdd,
If your carb is a manual choke it will have a spot on the forward left side 
for the choke cable sheath to be clamped to the side of the carb.  
  If you have an electric choke there is a wire connection on the rear, right 
side of the carb.  this wire comes from the ignition switch to the electric 
choke and goes onto the the coil.
