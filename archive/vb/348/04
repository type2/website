Bigger hardware stores sell plastic putty knives, which also work well
for things like this.  I use one (along with some parts cleaner solvent)
for scraping things like valve covers, sump plates, carb flanges, etc.
that I want to be clean but not beat up with a metal scraper.  It has a
real edge on it that holds fairly well.

The guy that tinted the windows at work said the same thing.  If you dig
around a little at the hardware store, you can find bottles of straight
ammonia, or at least ammonia with less dilution than what is in window
cleaner.  You might need gloves and goggles, but it should do better
than window cleaner.
