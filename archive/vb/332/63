Subject: need T.O. bearing clips '71

Oh omnipotent list...

I've got this 71-75 type throwout bearing (uses the sleeve assembly), VW
part number  113141165B.  I need the two clips that hold it in place. The
ones on my unit are stretched out of shape, the bearing is fine. Does
anyone have those two clips for sale? You can see the part here:
