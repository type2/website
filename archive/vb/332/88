Hi Ronnie,
Wiggle test the rear wheels, when the bus is jacked up.  If they are tight, 
make sure to top off the tranny center section.  Then take it for drive around 
the block several times, followed with draining the gear oil out of the tranny 
center section and RGBs.  Make sure to drain this into clean containers and 
check each for metal shavings.  You are looking for any pieces as big or bigger 
than a pin head.  A few are OK, but the more the more trouble you are in.  
Little or no pieces then the tranny is probably OK.
  As for rebuilding the RGBs, it is a dirty long job, but can be done by the 
novice if you take your time.  We were able to rebuild a 1955-63 RGB at a rest 
stop with onboard tools and a set of bearings in two hours.  The roller 
bearings of the 1964-67 bus RGBs are the only used bearings after a through 
inspection we will put with new ball bearings.  Good used ball bearings after a 
through inspection we will only use with used bearings in that RGB.  That way if a 
good used bearing blows out and ruins the rest of the used bearings, we have 
not ruined any new bearings.
