Subject: In the area - Vintage Meet - Seattle

We are just south of Seattle headed up for the Vintage meet in Seattle,
WA this weekend.  Plan to meet up with Clara thursday and join her in
the trip to the Friday night cruise-in and continue with the rest of the
festivities.  Would like to meet up with other folks from the area.
Stop by and introduce yourself.  We have the double door walk-thru 59 EZ
camper in racing primer gray.  As for us - look for the couple with the
matching t-shirts. :)
