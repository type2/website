Subject: Electrical Woes Again

Dear List;
This year I have been plagued with electrical problems. I guess this stuff
just comes in waves. If that's the case, the electrical surf is definately up
in my VW Barn.
I have a 1969 beetle (yes, I know this is a bus list and I'm usually seeking
help with my '66 Westy). While my '69 was running it suddenly died, no noises
or trauma, it just quit running. I followed the procedure in the Muir book to
check the fuel system, and the pump is pumping. I took a spark plug out and
got no spark. I checked juice to the coil and it has power. I took the
distributor end of the coil wire and held it 1/8" away from the intake
manifold while my wife turned the engine over...no spark from the coil wire. I
tried another coil wire and still no spark. When I put my grounded test light
in the center hole of the coil I get a very weak glow in the test light bulb.
I removed the wires from my installed coil and hooked them up to a used spare
12 V bosch coil.
When my wife turned the key nothing happened. I reattached the wires to the
installed coil and now I have no power in the car at all. No power to the
coil,everything seems to be dead. I checked the fuse box and the fuses all
seem to be intact. I'm at a loss as to what to do next.
Eric and Barb....Clara....and everyone else on the list, you have always come
through for me in the past and I'm hoping for some good advice tonight.
Thanks in advance.
John Flowers
