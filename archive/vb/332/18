Subject: Back under a bus after 30 years: A Most Amazing Clutch Cable

While I was installing a new shift lever bushing, I happened to let my
eyes wander under the front end. I had been annoyed by the way the
clutch seemed erratic from shift to shift, and was blaming the Bowden
tube, but now I wonder. Maybe this sort of thing is so common as to be
"non-reportable" or not worth mentioning, but this clutch cable
"repair" is so weird that I thought I would share it with the list at
the following link.
