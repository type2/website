Hi Ddixon,
Not a good idea.  Doing that results in the seam bunching up when the axle 
swings up and getting stretched when the axle swings down!  In section H-5, page 
5 of the VW transporter Workshop Manual 1963 it shows this seam should be set 
at a 9 or 3 O'clock position on the axle.  That way with the axle swing this 
seam just gets slightly bent into a curve instead of tortured tested.
  The joining faces of the split axle boots need to be sealed with some kind 
of sealant (we have used silicon sealant, but think some kind of gluing type 
of sealant would be better).
