Subject: broke down bus sighting

To whoever was driving the beautiful blue late 50's or early 60's bus
with the rack that was broke down at the junction of I-405 and I-5 in
the Seattle area, I'm sorry I couldn't stop. I wasn't driving my truck
and so didn't have my tools and parts stash. I hope you made it back OK
since I didn't see you on the way back from Everett.
