Hi John,
Do you have power at the fuse box?  If not, do you have have power at the 
starter connections and the battery itself?
  The power going to the coil while it goes though some connections at the 
fuse box, does not go through a fuse!  Battery, starter, fusebox, headlight 
switch, ignition switch, coil, distributor, sparkplugs, with grounding through 
tranny negative cable and battery negative cable is the electrical route for 
this!
