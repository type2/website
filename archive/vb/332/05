Subject: Vapor lock

Well, it's the second day and six restarts without any stopping along
side the road. I do believe that changing the gas cap has solved my
vapor lock problem. That was definately a strange one for sure. Thanks
all for the suggestions in the trheads for someone else. It only goes to
show you that not only do you solve one persons problem, but probably
several others plagued with the same situation that are reading the
threads.
