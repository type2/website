Subject: No idle, delayed motor racing after throttle

Volks:

Issues:	1) No idle
	2) delayed racing of motor seconds after pressing the throttle -
continues after releasing
	3) Most normal investigation complete

Engine:	1600cc
	first 34 PICT3, now 30 PICT 1
	Dual port stock size valves
	009

Quick disclaimer: the heads, intake, distributor, and carburetor are from
the same, very very very good running engine.  Same size as this one. 
OK, read on...

My 1776 finally died on the way to work in Olympia, so back into the
garage to build something "new."  I used the 1600 long block from
Gretchen, my '62 that I rolled.  :-(  Dual port heads came from the '61
deluxe which waits patiently for her restoration.  I used a 34 PICT 3
that a friend gave me, the intake manifold, distributor, and heads from
the '61, and built the motor, took a lot of care, cleaned and painted,
all the fun building stuff.  When I started the motor, I couldn't keep it
running.  It will start easy enough, but there is no idle whatsoever.  I
can pump the pedal all day long, but there is no idle.  The strangest
part is, when the engine is about to die, I have to pump the accelerator.
 As soon as the engine starts to speed up after a second or two, even if
I let go of the pedal, the rpm's still climb, and the engine runs as if
the pedal is depressed for 5 to 10 seconds.  Then it sounds like there is
no spark and it will die.  I can save it if I pump the pedal during its
decent. 

I rebuilt the 34-PICT 3, reinstalled, with no change.  I switch the 34
for the 30 which was originally mated to the intakes and juiced the heads
I stole for this engine.  Still no change.  I adjusted the valves...
nothing.  Regapped the spark plugs, and set the points.  I sprayed WD-40
all over the the intake manifolds and the carb connection.  No change. 
When the engine is running, it is so smooth it's gorgeous.  It looks like
it isn't even on.  But let go of the gas, and it dies. 

Now, if that wasn't enough:  3/4 exhaust is hot, 1/2 is cold, after
letting it run up and down for 10 minutes.  The valves and plugs are
good, the plugs are firing.  Both donor engines were running fine
previously.  What is going on here?

I would like to put a vacuum advance in, but the fact is, this is the
distributor that ran the best idling bus I've ever had.  

Help!
