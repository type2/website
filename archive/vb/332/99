true..

naotehr suggestion: Veewee's idea of cleaning out the flashing casting from 
the heads... well.. the motor does need to be stripped.. but I did this to the 
motor in my 61 when rebuilding the top end (convert to SP) and that could be 
part of why it runs cooler than some other buses... lets teh air actually flow 
better through the fins

need to watch CHT as well, as this is what causes pulled studs and other
