oh I dunno. if you give yourself time time rgbs shouldn't be very hard
to rebuild. I tore into mine to replace seals and the like, didn't
replace any bearings though. Long job, but not hard. Transmissions are
just one of those things that LOOK very hard.

I'd consider making sure the entire transaxle (including rgb's) is
full and see what happens then. One theory I can come up with might be
a bus that sits for a while w/ a leak in the rgb. boxes run dry from
sitting and no more fluid to fill it with center section low. I guess
it could happen, right?
