The numbers I posted are from Bentley for a 1500, so when you do open it 
up you have the factory numbers to go by. Most of my experience has been 
that the carbs come to lean.

I questioned the symptoms because many post that they are running a 
larger engine and think they need to increase the jets because of that. 
This is not the case most times. If I remember correctly the late Gene 
Berg claimed you could run a 28 on almost any engine, you just limit the 
top end.

IMHO I would rather be rich than lean, A lean carb will fry your engine 
if you are not real careful.
