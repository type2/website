Subject: Re: [VB] Back under a bus after 30 years! Transaxle question. 

some furry stuff on the magnets is normal

a brassy sheen in the oil is not... that is indicative of synchros wearing.  
brassy particles are bad.  the tranny is not supposed to whine, howl, thunk,  
or grumble.  It does normally make a noise, which should be ... um...  Low 
pitched.  smoothly meshing gears.
"woowoowoo" like out of tune guitar strings is a bad bearing.  Hard to 
describe noises.

low oil is not good for trannys... it shortens their life span.  but they are 
fairly sturdy beasts... and take much abuse.   They can work while getting 
noisier and noisier and popping out of gear and whining and grumbling, and 
getting hard to shift (esp into 2nd gear).  Tranny will get worse and eventually 
die.   I ran 25K on a tranny w/ whines and brass in the oil.   Your tolerances 
and luck may differ.  You may choose to rebuild it before the last minute  :)  
But you don't need to do it today.  But I doubt it'll last as long as mine 
did... that didn't have particles in the oil.

After a nice trip from Ohio to North Dakota (chronicled previously), I
changed all the fluids yesterday. The transaxle fluid was low, and the
bottom of the drain pan looked as though I'd been panning for gold. The
bronze or brass pieces are minute--no larger pieces at all. The magnets
on the drain plugs had similar "filings", lots of them, but again no
larger pieces.

Is this to be expected in a 40 year old transmission with 45000 miles
on it? Or should I start saving up for a rebuild or rebuilt
replacement? Third and fourth do whine some, but again I don't know if
this is to be expected or not.
