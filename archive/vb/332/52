Subject: Re: [VB] Please help me with my 1500 .... -OR- .... 1600 DP

For an engine swap....  The clutch might have to be swapped over... the bus 
takes a clutch with a ring on it.. the super beetle might have the later no 
ring clutch (I'm not clear on those late bugs). of course use the bus air cleaner 
on the bus.. think thats it as long as they both have the 12V FW already.    
cept the bug muffler won't fit the bus apron (unless its been hacked) or the 
bumper (ditto) so you'ld probably want to swap mufflers over.

BUT...  to get the bus engine sorted.  I personally have had little luck with 
the 34 carbs, and recommend getting a SP carb with adaptor if one is bad.  
I've experienced a few where they only work when you pump the gas.    Or swap 
the carb over from the bug and see how that goes. 

   to see if it is running on less that 4 cylinders, get the bus going and 
take one spark plug wire off the dist cap (not the center one) with a rag or 
spark plug wire pliers (not regular pliers cause they'll mess up the cables).   
the engin will slow down... move the end of teh wire back to the cap... see the 
spark fly... hear the engine change.... okay.. stick wire back on, and repeat 
for the otehr 3.  each time you remove a wire the engine should change the 
same amount.   If any make it not change... that means that cylinder is not 
giving it's oomph, or only partly.   In that case, check you plug wires first.. 
they should be supple and not ripped, and firmly attache dto teh spark plugs.   
they should be attached each to the correct plug (1-4-3-2) as you go clockwise 
around the cap looking down on it, starting at the notch on the edge of the 
dist.    some have the distributor drive in 180 off, which means everything 
must be rotated 180 degrees to run.

You might also pull and check your plugs... clean and regap or replace.

I have a 1964 VW Splitty (converted to 12 volts), and the original 1500 engine
(with dual port heads) is just not cooperating.   I can't seem to get it to
idle (after the engine warms), and I have had mechanic friends (although not
"aircooled VW" mechanics) take a stab at it to help correct this problem.   I
have recently set all the valves (-at-) .006", and have converted the 009 dizzy to
the "pointless" system.   The heads are a fresh rebuilt set, and I have a
brand new 34 PICT 3 carb on top.   I have had these "mechanic" friends attempt
to fix my idle problem, and to be honest I have no idea where the carb is now
set at.   The adjustment screws are at ?????, and the auto choke adjustment
has been screwed around with.   The thing seems to be running on 3 of the 4
cylinders, and every time I pull up to a stop sign it dies unless I do the
foot trick of left foot on the brake pedal, right foot feeding the gas.   THIS
HAS GOT TO STOP!!!


I also have a 1974 Super Beetle with a stock 1600 DP that runs great, but the
car is (body - wise) far from being road worthy.   How big of a task is it to
do the 1500 - to - 1600 engine swap in my bus?   I have removed the aircooled
engines from both bugs and buses, but I have never "swapped" engines (always
replaced the engine that I removed from the vehicles).   Is it really a
"simple" case of unbolt one and bolt-in the other?   I want to eventually
rebuild the original 1500 in my bus, but due to mostly time constraints, I
won't be able to do this for maybe a year.   I can't let my poor bus sit that
long without an engine!!!!

Thanks!!
