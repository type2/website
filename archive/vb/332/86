 i don't expect to see oil, but usually there is enough to get my finger
 wet(admittedly, i'm usually the one who filled the transaxle too), but it
 didn't seem to be up around that gear at alll, only picking it up as rolled
 through. so it would be normal for it to be at that level, and then fill to
 the top with a turn of the axle?

 no thunk that i noticed. but you do mostly hear the noise coasting, think
it
 may just be that engine noise covers it when giving it gas.  i tow roped
the
 bus as it wasn't running, and with the engine off you could hear the noise
 like a tire rub the whole while. but at tow rope speeds it was less
 constant. like an out of true bike wheel only rubbing when it hits that
 spot. at that point i thought it was the tire b/c they were all near flat
 and have weak side walls anyway.

 i ran it up on stands, the engine is loud enough to cover the noise with
bus
 idling in gear
