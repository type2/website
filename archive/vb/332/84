Subject: Re: [VB] fan width

 people who use the smaller diameter gen pulley have reported drops in engine 
temp on road trips... which means a faster fan does blow more air over the 
engine & makes more cooling.

my green bus ran too cool (oly in winter, round town driving) and so I 
switched back to a normal gen pulley.  then it warmed up better.

  The output from the fan is in a "choked flow" condition
at cruising RPMs, so spinning the fan faster won't flow any more air.
