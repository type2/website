Goal: Torque!

I need a temporary solution to carburate a 2007 (90.5x78.4) motor.  To
get
to the Bulli Brigade in Tampa from Northern VA! :)

I have all sorts of PICT style carbs  I like the 28 and 30P1 because
they are so
simple to tune and adjust.  But of course I need a certain amount of
fuel to
feed such a large motor.

Thanks,
