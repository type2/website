Subject: Please help me with my 1500 .... -OR- .... 1600 DP engine swap

I have a 1964 VW Splitty (converted to 12 volts), and the original 1500 engine
(with dual port heads) is just not cooperating.   I can't seem to get it to
idle (after the engine warms), and I have had mechanic friends (although not
"aircooled VW" mechanics) take a stab at it to help correct this problem.   I
have recently set all the valves (-at-) .006", and have converted the 009 dizzy to
the "pointless" system.   The heads are a fresh rebuilt set, and I have a
brand new 34 PICT 3 carb on top.   I have had these "mechanic" friends attempt
to fix my idle problem, and to be honest I have no idea where the carb is now
set at.   The adjustment screws are at ?????, and the auto choke adjustment
has been screwed around with.   The thing seems to be running on 3 of the 4
cylinders, and every time I pull up to a stop sign it dies unless I do the
foot trick of left foot on the brake pedal, right foot feeding the gas.   THIS
HAS GOT TO STOP!!!


I also have a 1974 Super Beetle with a stock 1600 DP that runs great, but the
car is (body - wise) far from being road worthy.   How big of a task is it to
do the 1500 - to - 1600 engine swap in my bus?   I have removed the aircooled
engines from both bugs and buses, but I have never "swapped" engines (always
replaced the engine that I removed from the vehicles).   Is it really a
"simple" case of unbolt one and bolt-in the other?   I want to eventually
rebuild the original 1500 in my bus, but due to mostly time constraints, I
won't be able to do this for maybe a year.   I can't let my poor bus sit that
long without an engine!!!!

Thanks!!
