Subject: Sundial!

Just wanted to pass along that I got an email from the son of the 
owner/designer of Sundial.  He put me in contact with his father and I 
created a new page on my website that I will be updating with info as I get 
it.  Here is the 1st email I got;
---------
Hi,
My dad was the owner/designer for Sundial.
Back around '60 he started Caravelle Campers in Home Gardens, Ca. near 
Corona and here is the brochure. He moved the business to Edgemont, Ca. (Now 
part of Moreno Valley) in the mid sixties and renamed it Sundial. He moved 
into other brands of vans and at one time had over 100 employees. The oil 
embargo of the early seventies killed the business so we moved to northern 
cal. where he started a small van conversion business called Kaleidoscope. 
It didn't get too far so he bought a portable toilet company and after 25 
years sold it last year and is now retired. He still has a van he did but 
it's a chevy, I think.

Here is part of another email, I thought I would share too,

I'm glad you enjoyed the info. I was born in '62 so my parents would be more 
helpful. The Sundial shop in Edgemont was an old skating rink. When we 
bought it it still had all the skates and these life size silhouettes  of 
young couples skating that stayed on the walls for years. My dad also made a 
small tent called the "Pee Pee Tee Pee" made out of the same canvas as the 
VW cabanas and it was just big enough to put a fold-up toilet with a plastic 
bag hanging under the seat. We tested the campers all over the western 
states and Mexico.  The family in the old pics is my aunt Ruth and her 
family.

The family he is talking about are the ones in the brochures.  Well I'm 
excited anyway.
