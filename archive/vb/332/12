Subject: Fitting IRS from a '76 Bay on a Splitbus

I own a Splitbus from Oct. '63 and I got my hands on a '76 Bay.

My question is, How much can I use from this bus to IRS my Splitbus.

The Bay also got a GE 2.0 motor (70 hp) I also want to fit this into my bus.

I have read on bus-boys.com that they have a Bay kit and a Vanagon kit.
What's in this kit and what can I use from the Bay

Earlier I have read a tread regarding fitting an early bay (68-69) front
beam to a split. It should fit right on , BUT rising the splitbus i bit.
How will a '76 front beam fit a splitbus ?
