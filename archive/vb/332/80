Hmmm, I just came back from a 12 day trip and found 1000 posts from VB and
T2.  Perhaps the reports of their demise are premature.

I also note a marked decline in the numbers of buses I meet on the road.
Yesterday, I drove 400+ miles and only encountered two baywindows and
no splitties on the highway.  I'd say that the decline in list usage seems
to parallel a decline in bus usage.

Certainly, web-based forums are a factor, but I prefer mailing lists
simply because they are faster on my slow connection and don't push
advertising at me.  I fear that some people have lost the ability to do
anything on the internet that doesn't involve a browser.
