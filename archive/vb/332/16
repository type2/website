Subject: Re: solenoid #30 terminal broken

Rob, this is easy.  Disconnect the batt, of course, remove the remaining
wires at the starter and unbolt the two bolts, remove the starter.  No need
to 'pull' the engine.  Now you will be able to read the lettering on the
starter, 12v or 6v.  The 6v starter's shaft that goes into the bushing is
app. 1/2" in dia. and the 12v is app. 3/8" dia.  That will confirm what
flywheel is in there.  Easy!
