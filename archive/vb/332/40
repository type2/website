and the rythym... i mean period, or time of each 'woo' changes with the 
speed.   there will be a speed where the woowoowoos go away.   like when the guitar 
string's in tune. 
  I guess that's where you are supposed to drive.

I like your description of bad bearing. "woowoowoo" like out of tune guitar

a rebuild. Just keep saving up and don't drive too far from home.
