Subject: RE: [VB] Fitting IRS from a '76 Bay on a Splitbus

Let me first start off being a downer...  If you cannot get a 1914 to work 
then I would not even consider an IRS conversion as it is complicated and 
requires tools and skills that I *think* you probable do not have yet.  Give 
your mechanical experience time to season and then take on the project :)

Kits

I would recommend the Bus Boys IRS kit.  They have the adjsutable trailing 
arm mounts that are great...  But still need cutting and grinding to fit 
right!  I used the Old Speed swing plates on my conversion as well as the 
shock mounts.

Also you will need SAW floating axles and T4 CVs with matching flanges.  I 
can just hear the dollars adding up (as I kick myself).

An IRS tranny, I used a 1303 single side plate tall ratio box.

Oh yes and to complicate things I added 944 rear discs as well.  Awesome 
stopping power!

Engine

See the "T4rum" on www.shoptalkforums.com for info on converting your 2.0 to 
upright cooling.  They will help you emmensely in that project.  Estimate 
750-1K for that switch.

Right now I am using a warm 1600 in my IRS conversion and it is pathetically 
underpowered.  Granted a 2007 (78.4x90.5) is in the works which will likely 
motivate the Westi a little quicker.

Pluses

On the up side the IRS does ride nicely and I kept it basically stock hight! 
  I like stock height to get off road to camp.

The gearing is great IF I had more power in the motor.  I think I could 
cruise at 75 and be fine.

---

Summary

It is a neat conversion and I enjoyed doing it.  And I think I would do it 
again.  But there is A LOT envolved and was more of a project than I 
intended it to be.  It is all reversable which is a plus to me also.  More 
to come, but I am happy with it.

Good Luck,
Adrian Pillow
