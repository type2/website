Hi Ken,
Sounds like you need to get a copy of the "Volkswagen Transporter Workshop 
Manual 1963" and the "How To Keep Your Volkswagen Alive" manual by John Muir!!  
These both are must have manuals and have this proceedure and tons of other 
good info you will need out on the road.
  Best to use a dial indicator and magnetic base, but you can get by with one 
of those cheapie endplay measuring tools that you use with feeler guages.  To 
take up the slack you can ONLY use three endplay shims, using differant 
thicknesses of shims gives you variable adjustment.  End play should be .003" to 
.005".
