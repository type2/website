Some have done this with good results, but it requires modifications to
the tin.  There is also a close-spaced type III cooler that fits in the
stock tin which you might consider.

I don't think that the variation in effective pulley diameter will make a
great difference.  The output from the fan is in a "choked flow" condition
at cruising RPMs, so spinning the fan faster won't flow any more air.
However, if you have used up all your shims it may well be time for a new
belt!

The most important thing to do is to minimize all the gaps where air can
leak through the tin, particularly those that allow hot air from under the
engine to return to the engine bay.  All the airflow in the world won't
help if the air entering the fan is already hot!  I've lost count of the
times I've stopped to help a VW person overheated on a summer day and
found gaping holes around the missing hot air or heater tubes.
