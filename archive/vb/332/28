Tom,

I went thru the rod thing a couple of years ago and there are places on 
the net that tell you how to build a device to do it end for end.

Basically, I gave up and just did the overall weight(like the factory 
did)....better to go ahead and pay for a complete balance job from an 
engine shop.

2: pictures?  can you catch a fingernail in the scratches?....unless they 
are *very* wide, I wouldn't worry about them.  Even 4 or 5 thousands'th
spread across a bearing shell is not going to bother it.  I surely 
wouldn't try to sand them out as you will distort the bores.

Plastigauge if you like, but after I did it a couple of times, I gave up.
the only place you can do it on the main bearings is in the middle...
And you should be able to tell about the rod bearings by feel and the 
book....by all means do the rods if you want though.

Measure the crank bearing diameters with a micrometer and if they are 
within spec and your bearings are correct for the outer and inner surface dimensions, you 
are pretty much done....rods are different though and I have usually been 
disapointed with the side to side play.

Cheers, dave
