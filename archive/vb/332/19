Hi Lars,
  We would not know if the Bus Boys IRS conversion kit is a complete bolt on. 
 We never found the need for IRS ourselfs, and prefer the simplictiy of the 
swingaxle!
Not sure what you mean by "bolt size".  To put an IRS suspension you need 
diagonal support to the trailing arms to prevent the rear wheels from push/pulled 
sideways and tearing the CV joints apart when going through turns/curves.  
  As for the engine compartment the early upright engine is about 28" wide 
and the type 4 pancake engine is about 36" wide.  You do the math!
  Plus from what we understand from others the type 4 tranny is longer than 
the earlier trannies so that would push the engine out the back of the early 
bus by a few inches!  Whoops!
