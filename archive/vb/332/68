Subject: RE: [VB] Bolt size question

See, here's a prime example of needing a parts manual and/or access to
the web for the vintagebus.com web site to look on-line.  (ok, off the
soap box)

Open group 7, Frame Hand Foot Lever
Page 340 'Frame', picture numbers 27, 28, 29

Page 344
 
27: 211 703 609  Cover plate
-   Bolt, hex head M6x10
28: Washer 6.1 (flat washer)
29: Tapping screw hex. Head B 6.3x13

Note that there are two different bolt types, the 6x10 that fits a
threaded hole and the tapping screw that goes into sheet metal.  Clean
things up before installation so you understand which are which.  I'd
make sure to run a tap in the 6mm holes.  Don't be surprised if some PO
already wrecked the situation.

Also note there is no mention of the anti-rattle felt pad between the
cover and frame!

Bought my bus without a cover plate under the pedals, and just got one
in the mail from CA. What size are the bolts, and are washers used with
them? Looked in Bentley and others, but it's too trivial a subject to
be mentioned, I guess.
