Subject: 30 or 28 PICT for big engine?

Goal: Torque!

I need a temporary solution to carburate a 2007 (90.5x78.4) motor.  To get 
to the Bulli Brigade in Tampa from Northern VA! :)

In the future it will be CIS fuel injected, but I cannot do everything at 
once as time and money are in short supply.

I have all sorts of PICT style carbs and was hoping to just drop one on and 
make the motor run with one.  I like the 28 and 30P1 because they are so 
simple to tune and adjust.  But of course I need a certain amount of fuel to 
feed such a large motor.

At worst I guess I could buy some dual Dell 40s, but I hate to waste the 
time on them since I will go to fuel injection in the future.

Any solutions are greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Adrian Pillow
