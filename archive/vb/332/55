It's garbage.  make a windchime out of it.

I made a puller thingy with a couple bolts (w/ washers?)  in the gaps and 
used a puller for sticky crank pulleys,.   When putting it on the other motor, do 
the test fit by hand, then  pull it off... look where it sticks.. there'll be 
scores on the inside of the pulley  sand there.. re test.. until its a firm 
press fit, but you can remove it w/o hassles.
