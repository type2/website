Hi Douglas,
Factory jets yes, but for what?  Take a look at the jets for the pre-1968 
bug, bus, and KG and each has a differant set of jets even when the engines were 
the same cc size!  It was only after 1967 that Vw made the engine 
compartments, and air cleaners breathe the same and at least here in the USA the 1600cc 
was the standard, so the same jetting could be used!
