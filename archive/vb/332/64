Volks of the list...

I need the following distributor, just the body and shaft, not the
rotor, cap, points, but it's got to have less than 1/16" vertical play
along the main shaft. Preferably a lot less (.040"). This means it has to
have those spacer washers all there on the bottom end of the shaft. I need
it to rebuild my electronic ignition. This is the distributor with vacuum
advance and the taller reddish/rust color cap and rotor.

Bosch number:  0 231 137 035
VW number:   113 905 205T   <<< it's got to be the "T" version.

Thanks!
