Subject: Re: [VB] Fitting IRS from a '76 Bay on a Splitbus

HI /lars,
  To fit a 1970-79 front beam in you would have to take it to a machine shop 
and get them to drill new mounting holes in its flange to match the 1955-69 
beam mounting holes.
  As for adapting to IRS you either just need to get one of the conversion 
kits or weld in the entire lower rear of the later bus from just forward of the 
torsion bars.  Plus the 2 liter engine will not fit the earlier engine 
compartment unless you convert the type 4 pancake engine to an upright stye of engine 
or weld in the later engine compartment.
  Our advice is if you really want to do this stuff do it right, modify it 
without cutting and welding it.  Then later when you decide it was too much work 
or when the next owner gets it the bus can be converted back with just bolt 
on parts.
