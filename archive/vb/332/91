Subject: Engine trouble in Maine

I have driven my 72 pop-top from Denver to Bangor, Maine and have been 
having problems.  To make the list short, I have had to jimmy-rig my starter 
with a wire running from the starter to the positive teminal of my battery, 
my engine stalls if I steo on my breaks too hard, etc, etc.  What I am 
asking is: Does anyone know where I can go to get my bus fixed up?  I read 
the archives and it seems that there is no VW bus workers in Maine - does 
anyone know a good mechanic who, although may not a bus guru, could still 
help me with my engine and starter?  Thanks for the help - my email address 
is woodring(-at-)hotmail.com.  Peace, Joe
