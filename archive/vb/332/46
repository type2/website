As cheap as the boots are I'd lose them and replace them both. It tokk
me 45 minutes to do mine and I spent two thirds of the time on the first
one. Make sure you clean up the mating surfaces real goos before you
clamp tight.

Hey Kids,
I have an axle boot that is leaking, but it is in very good condition(
no cracks or holes). Some of the screws and nuts are rusted. First owner
had the seam at TDC. Should I turn the seam horizional and re-tighten or
should I cut it off and replace with new. Thanks LJ
