well, if they are junk, then they are the best junk 
steering box i've ever had. mine's smooth as can be. there is a little bit of 
frame modification to perform when installing though. i bent mine with a hammer, 
rather than taking a cut-off wheel to it, so if i ever put a german one back in, 
it won't look bad. plus it has a slot for the steering/ignition lock already 
there! 

good luck finding one if you decide to go that way. 
anyone have a source? i'd buy another.

wolfgang has decent boxes too. 
ronnie??

I have also been told that the new Brazillians are junk.

 

Any thoughts?
