"time serts" are thin wall inserts. i use them 
regularyl and have not had any problems with them. i've used them in reduction 
boxes, again with no troubles and the 24mm length insert. my catalog does not 
show a 30mm length 12X1.5, but the part number would make sense, as it would be 
the next sequential number in the series.

a "BIG-SERT" is a "heavy wall solid bushing" "will 
repair oversize holes which have been previously repaired". they install the 
same way as time-serts, but it has a locking cam pin. "back out of the insert is 
prevented by the cam lock effect of the pin" the kits are only a few $$ more 
than regular time serts, but i have not seen nor used the big-serts. seems like 
it may be a little overkill, especially in a tight area.

anyway, for those interested, time-sert company's 
phone-- 1-800-423-4070 or www.timesert.com .

funny, i just called them today to order a 
mini-master set.......

  The "Big-sert" version, right?

  

They never mentioned the name Big-Sert to us.

 

 

 

Here is the info off the bag of the extra long inserts we received from 


Time-Sert

12 x 1.5

Length  30mm

Part # 12159

Go get her Joel!

 

20mm insert length would be the shortest we would use for only 25mm stock 


length bolts.  30mm is nice for longer than stock 35mm to 40mm 
bolts.  Would 

be real nice if they had a 35mm length insert though!

We have noticed the supply of longer inserts seem to ebb and flow instead 
of 

a constant supply.  Best to order a bunch when they are 
in!  Please keep us 

informed on how it goes.
