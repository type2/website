Here's my two cents worth.

When I replaced my Pop-out window seals, I had real trouble at first.  The
rubber would stretch in some areas, and therefore, be too loose in the other
areas.  I seemed to be forcing the Pop-out frame onto the rubber seals.  On
one side of the window, there would be a nice bead of rubber exposed between
the glass and the frame, and directly opposite on the other side of the
glass, the rubber would be pulled down between the glass and the frame, so
that the rubber bead would be 1/8 inch below the frame, leaving a valley for
water to collect.

I got a small paint brush and some anti-bacterial hand soap.  I know some
people use dishwashing liquid too but the anti-bacterial soap is thicker, so
it doesn't run as easily.  I painted the rubber on both sides real well and
the frames slid on pretty easily.  Then if the rubber was bunched up in one
area, (too big for the window), I could easily manipulate the rubber in that
area so that there were no wrinkles.  The rubber still wasn't perfect in the
corners, since the rubber that I got from Wolfsburg West is really just a
long piece of rubber glued together at the ends to form a rectangle.  I was
also able to move around the rubber in the corners so that it looked pretty
good.  Once the rubber isn't forced to stretch, it seems to fit pretty good.

Anyway, that's how I dealt with it.  Hang in there, be patient, and it will
work.

Good luck,
Ed
