Subject: Time-serts

Eric&Barb-
I am trying to track down the time-serts you recommended for RGB
repair, and I have a couple of questions:
M12x1.5, is that right?
The "Big-sert" version, right?
You were able to get these in a 30mm length? The receptionist at
Time-sert said she didn't think they had that length, but she would
look into it. I'd like to know that you were able to get them before I
hassle her further...
Thanks, Joel
(I am sending this to vintagebus too in case it helps someone else)
