 I don't have any specific comments on VW window seals but I can talk
 about refrigerator door seals as I sold appliance parts in a previous
 job.  Ideally the door seals would be shipped flat on a big piece of
 cardboard the size of the refrigerator door, but that is bulky and
 expensive, so they are folded up a couple of times and stuffed in a
 long skinny box.  If you pull them right out of the box and try to
 put them on the refrigerator, you'll never get the seal to lay flat.
 If you dunk the seal in a bucket of hot water (not boiling, but pretty
 hot) first, it is much easier to work with.  Another option is to
 unfold the seal, tape it down to something, and let it sit out in
 the sun all afternoon.  A similar treatment would probably help
 with VW window seals, even if they are somewhat the wrong size.

these seals are sold as circles-   extruded rubber glued at ends into a 
circle.  not crunched up.  the windows are much smaller than fridges, after 
all.   The thing is it seems that the circles are slightly too big.  With the 
rubber on the glass, it wants to pop off.  I squashed it into the window 
area, but if the seal was slightly smaller it would not have been such a 
bear.  

there is a metal area of the bus the window fits into.  the glass goes in 
that area.  In between the glass and metal is the rubber seal.  seemed the 
seal was too big.   I know the glass and metal window frame size had not 
changed.
