Subject: new seat belts in old busses

i perused all the posts and wb resources we had recently rambled through
regarding seatbelt replacement in our busses... but i realized that all the
ones i found were for WALK THROUGHS.

i have a 70 bench seater, and a 65 s/c, which also has a bench.

what do us bench-warmers do? we really don't have a place to put the lil
upright latch part...
