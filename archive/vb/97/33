He's talking about _Yellow_ on _Black_ from 63-on, which are not
currently YOM-valid at the CA DMV...

  You don't have to have OG plates or paperwork to get
YOM plates. Witness my '59 double cab with black on
yellow plates purchased at a Pomona swap.
  What you do need is LOTS of Excedrin Migrane,
tenacity, and patients. Mine took about 6 months and 4
trips to the local DMV.

This rabble may be of some help to Cali listees.

When I bought my 63EZ in Ariaona, I received the og Cali
black plates with the
bus.  Checked out the CA DMV website and see that the
cut-off year for YOM
plates is 1962.  Damnit!
