Hi Joel,
Correct.

They never mentioned the name Big-Sert to us.

Here is the info off the bag of the extra long inserts we received from 
Time-Sert
12 x 1.5
Length  30mm
Part # 12159
Go get her Joel!

20mm insert length would be the shortest we would use for only 25mm stock 
length bolts.  30mm is nice for longer than stock 35mm to 40mm bolts.  Would 
be real nice if they had a 35mm length insert though!
 We have noticed the supply of longer inserts seem to ebb and flow instead of 
a constant supply.  Best to order a bunch when they are in!  Please keep us 
informed on how it goes.
