If you want to get really picky, you can match the 'A' or 'AAA' string
with the year that the bus was sold. Talk about Type A! 

Anyone know the correlation of years to letters? I have a 'Y' plate for
my 11/59 commercial and it's not correct. The guy I bought it from has
an 'S' plate set also, which I understand is appropriate for that year.

Don't forget boys and girls that to be correct for your pre '63
"commercial" vehicle ie: bus, you want the black on yellow plates with 6
digits spaced like this:   A  ##  ### .  The other type  like:  AAA  ###
are for cars.
