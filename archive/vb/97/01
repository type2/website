Subject: ACAD Spice rack plans?

Question: Does anyone have plans for this spice rack?

I was asked some time ago for dimensions of the infamous Westfalia SO-42 style
L shaped what-not cabinet.  This is the cabinet which is commonly *supposed* to
be affixed to the rear most cargo door of a 65?-67 Westfalia. A young man on
the list is attempting to replicate this cabinet and would like help. Common
Autodesk/AutoCAD file formats would be excellent.

I simply have not had the time to cipher it out for him. 
Pmail mark.walz(-at-)web.de or myself if you can help out.
Thanks!
