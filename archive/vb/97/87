Subject: RE: [VB] ch ch ch goes the tipper

  I have found the "ch" sound before in a front end and turned out to be the
drum hitting against the front brake line between the wheel cylinders. On
reinstalation of the wheel cylinders I didn't get the brake line flat and
there was just enough space between it and the backing plate that it would
sometimes rub against the hub of the brake drum. Took at least 5 times
removing the drum before I discovered that irritateing "ch" sound.

ronnie  just a thought

Hi All,

After rebuilding the carb and fuel pump, the tipper is running great... but
I'm still looking for an HO-case close to my factory original (I've located
a few but I'm still waiting to maybe find one closer...)

Anyway, the one thing that bugs me is that I have a clicking sound coming
from the front end only during motion.  It's more of a 'ch' sound than a
'click' but it is getting a little louder as I drive it.  It does sound
vaguely metallic.  I rebuild all the brakes in it and the wheel bearings
appeared to be good.  I greased them up good and if you jack up the front
end and spin the tires, they rotate smoothly with out a sound or feel of
anything rubbing or grinding.  I also though about the speedo cable but if
you grab the cable under the dash while moving, I feel no vibration.

Any thoughts?

Oh, by the way, I did finally get my custom plates for it.... 'VW TPPR'
:-)

TIA

David
