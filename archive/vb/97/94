In an ideal world, it would be nice NOT to have to spend $200 for a
Steering Box.  But here's the facts from someone with experience.

A lot of time, money and labor is put into making sure a rebuild on one of
these is done right.  Having worked with Bus Boys and going through the
pain of figuring the Bill of Materials on each and every item involved with
building these and the 68-72 boxes, it's not cheap to do.  Where a product
necessarily involves keeping a person/customer alive, you don't scrimp when
doing one of these.

I've watched a steering box being disassembled, cleaned, all parts
inspected, the wormshaft thoroughly cleaned, checked and sometimes slightly
reground (if necessary), the steering peg (sector pin) disassembled,
slightly reground to precisely match the worm, new needle bearings (32 of
them!) installed on the peg, new ball bearings (28 of those!) installed for
the shaft,  bushings replaced in the box housing, additional cleaning and
painting.  Looking at my old references (these are about 6 to 7 years old),
comes to about $120 per steering box.  Generally, BBI (and I'm sure
Wolfgang too) would do a production run of about 6 to 10 boxes at a time to
keep the costs down to that level.  Any less, the production costs start to
go up a bit.  At today's costs, accounting for inflation, if any, it would
prolly translate to about $135 to $140 cost to do the box at the
rebuilder's level.

Of course, you have to mark the cost up to pay for the overhead to do just
such an enterprise.  Overhead includes any liability bonds/insurance you
have to have to sell an item that a person's life depends on.  BBI (and I'm
sure Wolfgang) shells out money on a periodic basis for that, so that
brings the net profit down some.  Steering and brakes are two definite
areas you don't treat lightly.

I know the persons at both Bus Boys and Wolfgang that do these boxes.
They're both good at it, knowledgeable in the correct procedures in doing
it and do a damn good job at doing it.  Heck, one of them's been doing it
it since he was 13.  They're not perfect all of the time, but their
defective rate is quite low, compared to other areas of industry rebuilding
defective rates of starters, generators, alternators, carburetors, etc.

Just my nickel's worth..............
