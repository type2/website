Subject: Re: [VB] Where is my VIN and other questions

VW seem to use up the old parts before starting in with the new ones.
I have a very early '64 model year with 15" rims which I believe to be
original, even though one would assume a '64 had 14".
VIN should be on both the M-code plate behind the passenger seat and
on the right side of the engine compartment close to where the apron
bolts on. I think some busses, not mine, also have a tag on the right
side of the freah air vent.

Hello all,
 i know this has been covered before but where is my VIN? Its on a 62
or 63.
Is it the tag to the right of the motor below the gas tank?
 Also my bus seems to be a transition bus, or my info is wrong.
It has the pull door latches on the front door. it has the late style
lip on
the wheel wells, it came with 15 inch wheels that look original with
old
style tires. Thin lips on the dog legs.
Everything looks original , i dont think it has been tampered with.

Thanks
Bryan
