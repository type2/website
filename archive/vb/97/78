Subject: Re: [VB] Rev Limiting Rotors

I think what you want was addressed by the "governer" under the carb.
The speed-limiting rotor is to try and keep people in the porsches and
the good old beamers from blowing up their expensive engines when
driving on the autobahn or the racetrack at speeds busses don't
belong. 6400 or 6500rpm was the last bosche one I bought.

i wouldnt say 3400 is where i red line, but if the purpose of me
installing
one of those is for when other people drive it, thats where id want it
to
cut out.  i also didnt know that they were adjustable, but that makes
more
sense.
