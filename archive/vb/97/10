Subject: Re: [VB] 67 Double Cab resto

50 bucks an hour!!???  I got to get into the VW body biz.  Who said TV was
where the money was???

Skip the entire body POR-15 crap...no need to.  A good blast and metal
prep, then a quality etch or epoxy prime is all that is needed.  POR 15
over fresh blasted body is WAY overkill.  Plus you'll need the tie coat
primer on top of the 15 if you wait too long.
