If you don't care about originality, they're not too
tough to build.  I did one years ago out of materials
available locally, plus some exotic woods I had around
(I used to be a cabinetmaker).  I had one on hand for
a pattern, and I'm real sorry I didn't make
dimensioned drawings.  Here's a picture of it (that's
Rachel {hazetgirl(-at-)earthlink.net} on top of the bus) at
a Jerome campout years back.
