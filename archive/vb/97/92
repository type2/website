on an early 64- yes you are supposed to have 15" and big nut
..............................
When
 did buses come with an optional 1500?
------------
available in 63.  The RGB were 'big little nut'- the gearing was 1.26, but 
the nuts were small.

 Never on a bus
 with 15" wheels right? 
------------
that optional 1 ton/ 1500 package came with 14", but the early 64 with 
standard 1 ton/1500 came with 15"  it's not that complicated.  Early 64s came 
with 1 ton suspension, 1500 motor and 15" rims.
...............
Wouldn't the combination of
 taller wheels, optional 1500, and big nut tranny make
 it the fastest production bus? 
--------------
The r/p was a 4.375 for 64.  Maybe the 14"/1500/ big nut /4.12 r&p 67s were 
'faster'  dunno.   I really like the early 64 gearing though- its what I have 
in my 61.

I guess I could look
 all this up myself, but it is faster and easier to
 just ask first. I am asking to see if I need to
 replace the tired GEX motor with a nice 40 horse.

huh?  you can put a 40hp in it if you like, but any 1 ton splitty came with a 
1500.    I'd use a 1600 with that gearing, for driving around.      unless I 
had a good 40hp around, just waiting to be put in a bus

Friend of mine had a 40hp in his 65 (1 ton) and it went fine.  just putted 
around town a little.
