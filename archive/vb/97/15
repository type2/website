Subject: Lower hinges

Hello, All...
   While I was working on my bus yesterday, I noticed that
the lower hinges(where it mounts to the door) on the drivers
and passengers doors are loose and have a few small cracks
around them. Do I just weld them up or is there some kind
of reinforcement plate that I could make and install?
Thanks!
