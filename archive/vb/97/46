The new Brazilian ones that are out there don't fit.  Everyone got burned on
those ones.  Beck-Arnley, Motorworks, several VW specialist distributors, a
bunch of retailers, and myself.  They came from a reliable importer who
generally knows their VW parts, but they were way off base on this one. They
are for a Brazilian spec bus. I did have one customer who managed to modify
it to work but it wasn't worth the hassle.  By now I would suspect that
everyone who had them has discovered that they're wrong (I pulled them off
of my site ages ago) but if you come across anyone who has steering boxes at
a cheap price that's probably what they have. Since Beck-Arnley has these
wrong ones, and they supply most of the full-line auto parts stores, you
should also beware of ordering one from your local FLAPS.
