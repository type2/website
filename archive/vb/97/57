 Todd,
Your plates are black letters on plates. These are the last series of plates
you can use as YOM plates.
These ended in 62.
Starting in 63, the plates were black with yellow letters. And the order
reversed. Yellow w/black letters were number/letter, i.e. 123 ABC. Black
w/yellow letters were letter/number, i.e. ABC 123.
You cannot use a black w/yellow plate on a 63 and up unless you can prove they
are the correct original plates from when the vehicle was 1st registered.
