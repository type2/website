Subject: Re: Attn. all shoppers, black plate special on aisle 63

  You don't have to have OG plates or paperwork to get 
YOM plates. Witness my '59 double cab with black on 
yellow plates purchased at a Pomona swap.
  What you do need is LOTS of Excedrin Migrane, 
tenacity, and patients. Mine took about 6 months and 4 
trips to the local DMV.

This rabble may be of some help to Cali listees.

When I bought my 63EZ in Ariaona, I received the og Cali 
black plates with the 
bus.  Checked out the CA DMV website and see that the 
cut-off year for YOM 
plates is 1962.  Damnit!
