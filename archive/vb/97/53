Rich,
That is correct!  Yellow on black plates are only able to be used if you can prove those plates were og to the vehicle.  62 and back (black on yellow)are easy..all you have to have is set of clear plates.

I wouldn't have been able to use these plates if VanBondo hadn't found the og registration receipts.
