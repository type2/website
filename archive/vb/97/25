Subject: Re: [VB] My new 62 15 window deluxe

Congrats!  Corner window buses are the coolest!  360 degree vision is really 
nice.  Does it drive?

yes the number is in three places as they said- the easiest to find is on the 
metal bulkhead behind the pass seat.  the plate there says

build day (day mo yr)
m- codes (these are 3 digit codes- decipher them on Thom's web site)
model, colour, VIN

this would have the earlier style of m-code tag, so don't be confused if some 
say the colour code is numbers or the build date have no year on it- that is 
the later style.

SWR BG means Sealing wax red and beige grey  the interior would be basalt- 
meaning darker grey above and below on the panels, and lighter grey with fine 
cross hatching in the middle.  Seats light grey upholstery w/ white piping.  
Though the pull handles were used through Dec 63, the 15 window option 
stopped at the end of the 63 model year. Ya 15" rims were used through early 
64 as well.

 Hi Bryan,
 That could be a 62 thru very early 64 (NOV63?) model.  The VIN should be on 
 the plate on the right forward engine compartment below the gas tank, but 
 that could have been easily removed and replaced in the past.  Try instead 
to 
 find the stamped VIN number in the body on the right horizontial surface 
just 
 forward of the rear apron.  This to could have been cut out and welded a 
 differant VIN, but it is alot harder.  Since you are doing this also check 
 the M-code plate behind the front passenger seat for the same VIN.
