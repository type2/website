Subject: RE: Westy Spice rack

it seems EVERYBODY at some point has a junk or spare spice rack to "make 
templates" from... but have we ever seen one? NOPE! ive gone online and 
gotten drawings/measurements for bird houses and nesting boxes... this is 
how i would envision the spice rack plans to be. real simple. thats all we 
need. you could cut all the pieces and slap it together.
