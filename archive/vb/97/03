Hi Diana,
You might be using a stock fan and lower pulley.  But is the fan a 29mm, a 
34mm, or 35mm width?  There were earlier fans made with less than 29mm width! 
 29mm is the least we would use on a non-doghouse 1500-1600cc engine and 33mm 
the least we would use on any sized doghouse engine!  Is your lower pulley a 
1.6:1, 1.8:1 or 2:1?  Using anything less than a 1.8:1 on a 1500-1600cc 
non-doghouse engine or anything less than a 2:1 on a doghouse engine will 
cause problems.  As for your gearing do not assume it is stock!  Borrow a 
tach and see where 1,500 and 3,000 RPM is in each forward gear.  We had in 
our 1960 panel camper conversion when we got it a tranny that only did 35 MPH 
in fourth which probably explains the DP engine with a hole through the top 
from a thrown rod since the previous owner must have been doing 5,500 RPM to 
do 55MPH.  Boy did it have great acceleration up to 45 MPH with a big bore 
40HP engine!  
  You heat problems could even be to too high of compression or even to early 
and thusly small of oil pump or just a bad oil pump.  Just throwing an engine 
together out of any year stock parts can cause so many problems.

>> Guess I have to pull out all the jets that are in the carb and look at 
them?  Are the sizes stamped on them? <<

Yes, they should have sizes stamped on them.  That might help.  Though we 
have often found even new jets to be several sizes off from what is stamped 
on them!  Best to borrow or buy a jetting gauge for about $25.00 so you can 
test even used jets for size since they often are worn bigger or drilled out 
by DPOs.
