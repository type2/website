Subject: Re: [VB] 6 volt to 12 volt

I would think the easiest way would be to install a battery that has 3 [three]
terminals,, one is neg, one is +6v and the other is +12v,,  that way you can
charge and run at the 12v to grd and use the heater on the 6v to ground
terminal.

or, use 2 x 6v batteries in series.  I don't know which is physically easier, or
cheaper, but electrically it is both the same,,

some one recently posted a url to the list about batteries like this that are
available in the vintage car fields,, like the 8 volt battery substituted for a
6 to cure hard starting,, 

Good Luck Jamie Auch :-)
