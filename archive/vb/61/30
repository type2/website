The original hubcaps feel heavier to me, although I have not weighed them=
.
 I have seen a couple other people lift up hubcaps at shows and pronounce=

"Hey, this one is real" as well so it's not one of delusions.

I've noticed the couple original grey hubcaps I have are a different colo=
r
than my VW of Mexico ones.

You can tell on the chrome hubcaps because the repros rust quickly.
