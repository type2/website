I've seen a lot of hubcaps at the swaps with the "VW"
logo stamped outward. That is, the "VW" part is raised
on the hubcap.

These are repro, since the OG caps had the "VW"
recessed. 

Again, not to say that ones with the "VW" recessed
aren't repro, just better repro's than the ones with
the VW raised.
