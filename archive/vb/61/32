Subject: Re: Broken needle on fuel gauge

Idiot current owner broke the needle on the speedo on my 65 when I had it apart to clean up rust & dust inside the housing.

I cut a small splint from a flat toothpick and used Elmer's to glue that to the back of the broken-off piece, with a little bit extending past the break.  When it dried I 
glued it to the needle stub.  IIRC I used scotch tape to hold the thing together while it dried.  Need to keep the needle off the stop while it's drying - easy enough 
with a little scotch tape, since the return spring is very light.

This was several months ago, maybe close to a year.  So far, so good (knocks wood).  You can't even see the break unless you look really close.
