Subject: Re: [VB] removing inner  front wheel bearing

Hey Michel

Front bearings - for me those were a nightmare.  As I recall, I destroyed
them and removed them in pieces, but that was OK because I would never have
risked using them again anyway.

Thanks for the info about ordering from Europe.  I too need to replace my
front wheel cylinders.
