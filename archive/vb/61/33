Subject: og shocks... another AR question.


In my search for a pair of 4-59 date code Fictel & Sachs shocks for my May
19, 1959 double cab, I found someone with a 59 bus that was built one day
after mine (May 20) and his bus has Boge shocks on it... he claims they look
like they could be original.  My double cab had two of the 4-59 date code
F&S shocks when I got it and I would really like to find another pair so I
could rebuild all four (anyone have two??????????????)  Anyway, as a LAST
resort, if boge shocks were indeed an option back then, I guess I could
lower myself to using these if no F&S ones show up.

Any thoughts beyond that fact that I might be totally crazy?


TIA
David
