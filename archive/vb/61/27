 Does anyone have any idea how to "open" up a fuel gauge (12 volt)?  A friend
 dropped his and the needle broke.  He had just purchased it and open the box
 and to the ground it fell.  Any help would be appreciated.

you turn it over and carefully pry up the edge of the metal that holds the 
glass on the cup.  Ya the chrome, so be really careful or you'll bugger it 
up.  Then the chrome bezel and glass will come off, and the gasket between 
glass.bezel and the cup will come apart in a bunch of pieces and be a pain to 
put back together.  Now you have the glass off, what'll you do, glue it 
together?   Is this a special fuel guage?
