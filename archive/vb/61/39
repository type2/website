Casey,
How much of a strain?
WAY TOO MUCH.
The biggest VW alternator that I have seen provides 75 amps.
That is right around 1000 watts
1500 watts would require an alternator capable of providing in excess of
125 amps
With headlights, you are going to need 30-40 amps to just drive the
vehicle.
Add stereo and you're really pushing it.
You're up to at least a 200 watt alternator.

FYI  Watts = Amps x Volts
Also, for a long life out of electrical gear, it is best to keep their
sustained load at or below 80% of their rated value.  (In many places
that 80% figure is mandated by code).  Leave that extra 20% to handle the
load peaks.

You may notice that many devices are now being rated at XXX Continuous
and YYY peak
1. XXX is putting that 80% value in writing
2. YYY is peak and many times has a time limit associated with it.
I have seen equipment burnt to a crisp where it has been continuously run
just below peak (98%)

This is one of those seasonal topics that hit every year about this
time.  The colder winter we get, the more inquiries hit the list.
Electric heating has been beat to death and then some here on the list,
you might want to browse through the archives for more ideas.

Keep an eye on ebay for a gas heater.  I've heard them called Nuclear
Sausages and from my experience, they are well worth the name.
