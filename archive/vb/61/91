Subject: Re: [VB] Wiring through bellypans?

Our wring was removed by PO and we could not even after a Long Long time get
them back in the original location (we did get only a singular wire through),
but this was not enough to pull with, we needed the OG wire harness to replace
them  with, so we had to drill two holes (each side of the belly pan) to fish
the new harness through using rubber grommets to protect the harness.
