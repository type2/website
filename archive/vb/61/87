     Well,gang I had some nice words and not so nice words dealing with my 
art. file format.  I won't be selling the bus to the people with the not so 
nice words (you know who you are).  So I retook the pics today and have added 
them to my site in JPEG format.  Now anybody can see them.
                                                                     Peace,
