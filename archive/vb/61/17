Subject: VW is gettin blurry

I noticed in WCM catalog http://westcoastmetric.com/bugpage/bug72.html
Every VW emblem is blurred out on all the mudflaps and hubcaps. Im sure it
has somethin to do with the VW lawyers, but does that mean that all their
hubcaps and mudflaps no longer have the emblem on it? Or is it just a
website related issue of "dont show VW symbols", and if so what about those
center caps.
Just curious if I need to start putting all my used hubcaps on Ebay
