Subject: Re: [VB] og hub caps

i can usually tell by the sound they make when i plop them on the ground
after removing them from the wheel. then i immediately curse the repro ones
(if any) to the ends of the earth.
german ones are heavier gauge metal than repops, and usually you can't see
finishing marks in the chrome of german hubcaps.
also, on non-chromed ones, the german ones tend to not rust as much on the
insides.
heck, why even bother?--go for that guerilla look!
