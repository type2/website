NB the bezel isn't too happy about being pried off and then trying to put =

stressful too look for a good used guage for about $40.00. The needle =
should also prove to be a Royal PITA to try and take off/replace.

 Does anyone have any idea how to "open" up a fuel gauge (12 volt)?  A =

 and to the ground it fell.  Any help would be appreciated.

you turn it over and carefully pry up the edge of the metal that holds =

up.  Then the chrome bezel and glass will come off, and the gasket =

together?   Is this a special fuel guage?
