Subject: Hawaii =?iso-8859-1?q?listees=3F?=

I know it's a long shot, but if there are any listvolk in Hawaii, I'd appreciate it if you could drop me a line. I know there are busses out there, as I've seen them in different magazines...I'm headed out there next month, and want to get the inside scoop. 
BTW, tickets are CHEAP to Hawaii in February...($337 instead of $650-ish)
I had to fly, since I can't drive the camper or crew cab out because I haven't got all the Schwimmwagen equipment hooked up yet. That and the floor has more holes than a sponge, so they're not too seaworthy...
I'm also not driving them in the 4" of snow outside this morning, because I can't find my &#^%$%# chains...
thanks
