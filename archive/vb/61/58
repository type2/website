List:

Am I missing something here???  I always thought orignal VW hubcaps had a VERY tiny VW and a 3 (maybe 4) digit number right next to the tiny VW on the inside lip of the hubcap.  I know I've personally seen at least 20 hubcaps with this number.  That's how I have always identified orignal hubcaps.
