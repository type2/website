Subject: RE: [VB] Disassembling spindle assemblys

the upper king pins are a press fit into the lower kingpin. you really do
need a press and some kind of jig, or vw special tool 223a or 460. they are
really tight! i used the 223a and it took alot of force to get them apart.
puting the seals on is not really difficult, but to re-assemble you again
do need a press.
