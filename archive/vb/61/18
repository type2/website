 why are you doing this?  It seems an odd thing to do to get rid of the oil 
 cooler.  WHy not have an oil cooler?

  I am installing an oil cooler block off plate, and I have a few questions I 
  hope some of you can help me with.  First, let me describe the plate:
  
  It is a flat plate with a U-shaped hump for the flow-through tube.  The 
  "hump" has a hex-plug that provides access to the flow-through chamber.

Really? The only "block off plates" that I know of are items 28 and 29, page 
24 of the
RMMW catalog, 1996 edition. These are essentially one item plus a gasket to 
block off the holes of a Type 3 engine and make it a Type 1 engine. A Mexican 
case is required, or the case must be tapped like a Mexican case in order to 
use this item,
which costs about $3.95 in today's dollars. We were just talking about this 
application, and I have one (with Mexican case) that does just that for my 
1971 bus. 
The oil cooler is identical between Type 1 and Type 3. One must remove three 
nuts
and a "stand-up" gizmo from the Type1. Then, it is obvious that the oil 
coolers (Type 1 versus Type 3) are identical. But the oil cooler is required 
on both engines.
