Subject: Re: [VB] side pop outs needed

Hello,
I've had good results with Dave Palmer's Creative Engineering repop Pop-out
frames.  I also got my Safari Window kit from him, and it's far superior to any
kits out there on the market.  Any of Dave's Safari or Pop-out parts are
interchangeable with the originals.  I bought mine direct from Dave's shop in
England, but I believe that Ronnie (-at-) Oldvolks carries a lot of Creative
Engineering stuff.

It goes without saying that the original part is always best.  I can't tell you
how many original Pop-out frames I went through, just trying to find some that I
could get those #$*&(-at-)$# tiny little screws out of.  They must have automatically
rusted the minute the Bus was driven off the showroom floor.  Short of NOS, I vote
for Creative Engineering stuff.  You can log on to Dave's website at
www.creative-engineering.com.

Good luck,
Edr
