It seems like the mpg should really drop at wide open throttle speeds
but like Rachel, I do not see much of a drop in fuel economy with my '67
bus running a sp 1600.  Mike Fischer in Phoenix ported the semi-hemi cut
heads so it does like to run fast.  It is also totally balanced and has
a c/w crank,the r&p is 4.12-1.  After Thanksgiving driving on the
freeway with two passengers going about 65mph I was passed by a new Euro
Van whose driver failed to wave. After a minute or so I thought that
this is wrong.  I caught the Euro and passed him going an indicated 78
mph.  He waved this time.  I kept this idiotic pace up for many miles.
Back home I filled the sucker up and the fuel economy was about normal.
20-21ish mpg.  I recently rejetted it for the drive to BBB6.  It should
do much better at a slower speed????   Gary Gibson
