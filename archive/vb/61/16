Subject: Re: [VB] Who knows about "Kustom Kamper"

Someone may be able to correct me, but that looks a lot like the bus that
was owned by that Olympic medal guy (sorry for the vague description).  I
read about it in one of the VW mags (Trends I think).  Maybe someone can
correct me on this as I still have all of my back issues packed away in
boxes.

Later
Charles
