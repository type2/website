 Anyway, the 28 PICT had a spacer thing under it  that made the carb sit too 
high.  I had to jamb my oil bath air cleaner on because it hit the top of my 
engine compartment.  So I had a machine shop take about 1/4" off the spacer 
so my oil bath air cleaner will fit better.  How should this affect how my 
carb works?  I was running rich, I suspect, so will making this spacer 
smaller make me run leaner, less lean, or no difference?

I have used diff sized spacers  depending on the intake. carb etc you know 
how much room the carb needs.  Yes if the spacer is too tall it can make 
putting the air cleaner tube on the carb tricky.   I don't know that it 
affects anything else much.   It would affect how much area is available for 
carb icing.   other than that, dont worry.   What size motor and year bus is 
this again?   What style air cleaner are you using?
