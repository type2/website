Subject: RE: [VB] '67 Bus Rims Out of Round

I have 8 or 9 extra 67 bus 14" rims along with 4 with mounted tires.  I
could part with 4 and make sure they are true before I sent them.

Could anyone tell me if they are date coded??? I would of course want to
make sure I keep the correct rims for my June 22, 1967 tipper but beyond
that, I have no need for that many stock 14" rims.

Well, My '67 21DLX has three rims that are “out of round” to the point that
it affects the ride, even when balanced. Wow, I thought I had every thing
relatively “licked,” on my bus and this pops up. I never saw this one
coming! More parts to locate!  What is the scoop on stock 67 bus rims?
Anyone  repoing them? Any suggestions?? The problem with buying “used” at a
swap meet is that they
could be out of round too.
