Subject: repairing post, metalwizard site ??

hi all


the mango bus this month on Metalwizard is the same as me, a 1960 one mango,
but yet i notice (on page 2) that the POST (splash area) on this one is
pretty straight  and MY bus that is also a 1960 bus has curved POST (you
know, kind of a bubble popping toward front).

  Now is this because this one is a walhtrough and mine is not ??  thats the
only reason i see ,... much more easier to repair this area when its
straight...
