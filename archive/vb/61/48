Subject: havasu details?

how much is it per night at the campground?
is anyone coming from the east coast who'd be willing to bring me a case of
yuengling lager and/or a case of moxie?
is there a website with show info, past pics, etc....
just trying to plan ahead...it's coming up real soon!
anyone need parts transported from the bay area to havasu or from havasu to
bay area? i probably will have some room to carry stuff, as long as it gets
to my house before i leave or you can pick up here after havasu. nothing
super big, please, and please arrange this before i leave.
see ya there
