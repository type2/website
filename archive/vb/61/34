Subject: RE: [VB] og hub caps

 It depends on year, but the weight and thickness of the metal, also the
puller holes in them and the earlier ones are 2 piece (the ones I have
here). I have some old stock Mexico that you would play heck trying to tell
the difference. There are NEW GERMAN available on a very limited supply and
the price reflects this. These are NEW not NOS German caps. Last time I
checked they were $200.00 dollars a set. I have gotten a couple of these
sets for customers and 1 of these caps weighs almost as much as 4 Brazilian.

  Another way to tell is the fit. I have as of yet to find a Brazilian,
Mexican or Taiwan that fit correctly on the wheel.

Hi All,

I thought I would ask...

'How can you tell original hub caps from those from Brazil, Tawain, etc'?


Thanks
David
