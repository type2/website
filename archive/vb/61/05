Subject: Who knows about "Kustom Kamper"

I have a '61 panelvan camper conversion, which I have finally identified as
being a "Kustom Kamper".  Does anyone know anything at all about this
company.  Where they were located?  Do they still exist?  Does anyone have
any literature?  Any other "Kustom Kampers" out there?
Any info at all would be greatly appreciated.

My bus can be seen at this link:

Thanks.  Don...
