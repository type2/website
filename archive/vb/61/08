I'd be interested in seeing a picture of a folding roof ladder  - (sorry I
can't help with the caps).  I was thinking of making one.  Are there any
pics out there?

List:

I have 3 of the 4 rubber end caps that go on the four legs of a folding
roofrack ladder.  Any chance someone has a spare rubber end cap they'd like
to sell?  Otherwise I guess I'll have to crack and buy 4 generic ones at the
hardware store.  Geez, it even hurts to type that, let alone do it.

TIA.

Robert
