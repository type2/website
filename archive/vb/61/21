Subject: I need to get rid of some metal.

    While the subject of sheetmetal is still fresh; I've been doing a bit of
repair panel research, and I have some stuff to get rid of.  These all came
from RMMW, and they're all the cheapo Brazilian stuff.  They sent me the
pair of top hat sections insisting they were the inner rocker pieces.  I
certainly won't miss dealing with RMMW on repair panels.
To be honest, I'm not really impressed with the quality of these, but the
price is right.

1 pair of front floor panels - $35 each side
1 Front right jack support - $14
1 Cargo door rocker - $20
2 top hat sections - $25 each

I don't imagine shipping will be too much.

Thanks,
