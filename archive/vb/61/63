last night i conducted a "scientific experiment" to determine at which speeds my 1967 beetle (it is friday) gets the best gas mileage.  i drove to work (between 80 and 90 miles) averaging about 60-65 mph.  then i drove home averaging between 75-80 mph.  normal i don't hoodlum around so much but for the sake of scientific inquiry, i felt that the sacrifice was necessary... okay and i had a lot of fun too.

anyway, i found that my beetle's fuel efficiency was only slightly less at greater speeds; the fuel gauge a little below the quarter tank line and i always leave for work with a full tank.  i had expected a much larger change in fuel consummation though... perhaps i need to try again going faster....

my beetle is powered by a 1648 dual port with a webber two-barrel.  when fresh, it ran hotter than hell but i swapped out the main jets for some larger ones (137 to 140 and 140 to 150) and that seemed to do the trick.  the gas mileage also improved from about 22 mpg to the current 27 mpg.  (i think the improvement in gas mileage is probably due to some other work i had done/did myself during those 22 mpg days.)  jon says i'd get even better gas mileage if i got rid of the stock exhaust and used an extractor.

my single cab with an ordinary 1600 single port and 30 pict 1 carb gets about 22 mpg with an average speed of 60 mph.  my truck has not worked real hard carrying stuff for great distances yet, so the 22 mpg is unloaded.  both engines are comparatively fresh with the truck's engine having probably fewer miles on its clock.

i'd planned to tell you about my "scientific experiment" and then tell you to slow down!  so after all this, my suggestion is to follow jp to havasu with a lighter load and see if his slower speeds and the lighter load have any effect on your gas mileage.  i think they will.

this may be of little use, but it did delay the time for me to go and push the mower around, which is what i wanted.  see you (all) in havasu!
