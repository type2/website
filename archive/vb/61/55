Subject: Disassembling spindle assemblys

Hello, All...
How does one go about taking the spindle assemblys
apart on a 65 bus? The upper and lower link pin bearing
'parts' don't seem to want to disassemble. Is there a 
trick or a special tool or just "take it to someone who
knows how to do it".  The spindle assemblys are
tight but I am having to replace the rubber bands around
the joints. 
Thanks in advance!  ...and Happy New Year!
