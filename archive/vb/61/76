Subject: Back by popular demand - Alan Schofield repair panels

I'll be importing at least one shipment of panels from Mr. Schofield in
England, and if it works out, I'll be the new US importer.  If anyone wants
something, drop me a line, and I'll make sure it gets included.
If you want to see what's available, you can check out Alan's site at
www.ahschofield.co.uk

Thanks,
