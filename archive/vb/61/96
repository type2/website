I personally get it all the time. Some people just like to be that 
way. Don't know why. Whatever. I've got thick skin. I ususally don't 
think a thing about it and just delete the message. But can tell you 
that if someone said something to me like has been emailed to me to 
my face, I'd probably stomp them. Yeh, I'm fat and older and out of 
shape...but I'm still rowdy and don't like that rude BS.

It's the email thing. Very simular to when someone drives by you and 
flips you off. For some reason they feel that being in the plastic 
bubble of their vehicle allows them to do stuff they wouldn't 
normally do. Would a guy flip you off if you stepped in front of him 
by accident while walking down the sidewalk? MOST of the times...no. 
He won't think a thing of it and will just step around you. But that 
car thing. Makes people feel all powerful. Every couple of years I'll 
catch up to someone and step up to them....and the look of total fear 
on their face when I walk up to their car window is amazing. They're 
then forced to deal with their actions. That's all it takes. The 
reality check. Yeh, I know. I could get shot. But what the hell. If I 
don't care, neither should you.

So my suggestion is that instead of kicking these rude folks off the 
list, we let me and some of the other "old school" guys on the list 
(you know who you are) round up a bunch of our white trash redneck 
associates and throw them in the back of a Black '57 DD panel. We'll 
drive by the guy, swoop him into one set of cargo doors, let those 
associates "have their way with him" , and then throw them out the 
other set of cargo doors. Reality Check. Sounds sensible to me.

Who says if you drive an old VW bus your a peace loving hippy? right?

But on a serious note, you guys really ought to think about what you 
write sometimes. Lots of snooty comments and plain rude remarks. Just 
not neccassary. I'm all for free speech, but lets try to have a 
little maturity.

Plus, you never know when that primered '57 DD panel might be driving 
by to check up on you:)
