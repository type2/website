Ever since leaded gas went away I've only seen black tailpipes. I don't
think the Muir tailpipe colors apply any more. The spark plug check
still seems to work for the ceramic part of the plug. The outer metal
ring usually looks sooty to me no matter now rich or lean the mixture
is.

Have fun.

I still have the 21.5 (I think) venturi so it maybe that I'll have to hone that out to something bigger, maybe 22 mm to start, because I don't think I'll be able to locate a bigger venturi.
