 Wow
 
 in the restoration process of my microbus 1960, i dropped the axle beam on
 floor, and removed all  brake part (then the surprise, all wheel cylinder
 are stuck in rust), now to remove the inner wheel bearing its a hard think
 it barely move, i dont have a puller with me, is there any trick to remove
 this, in order to get my backplate to be blasted/por-15 ??

I keep hearing how people drop the beams, and then take stuff off.   I find 
it easier to dissassemble as much as possible while attached to the bus.  As 
it is held firmly in place.  Makes it easier to bash the offending bearing 
off.  Can always take a grinder to it (careful- dont grind into spindle, stop 
just shy of it)  and try penetrating oil.
