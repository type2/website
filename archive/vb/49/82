Congratulations!

Whatever you do, don't forget to pay your exorcist in full and on time.
Otherwise you'll get re-possessed...

The headlight trouble is probably in the fuse box.  There are four fuses
for the headlights in all - low/high beam, left/right bulbs.  If the
fuses are OK, the contacts in the fuse box might be loose.  If you find
a loose contact, Eric&Barb recommend soldering *all* the contacts
together.  Use a heavy soldering iron and rosin-core or solid solder -
DON'T use acid-core solder!
