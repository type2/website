Okay, here's one:

I've been at a VW dealership looking at GTIs, Jettas and Passats.
The dealership knows that I'm qualified and serious. 

What is the best way to let the salesperson, who is still calling 
and emailing me, know that I've bought a Volvo?  The VWOA legal
monster is part of my reason, but I'm not much of a wordsmith.
