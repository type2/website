Subject: RE: [VB] Terrible sound, help!-Solved, Thanks to all.

It was the bar that transfers the ebrake lever pressure to the front shoe,
installed incorrectly. Thanks to all who helped point me at where to look.
Glad to see the simple things can sound big! :)
Of course, now it's raining finally, in the NE.

Hi AL,
Could be you rebuilt the RGBs incorrectly or perhaps the arm/s inside the
brake drum/s that the E-brake cable slips over, is not tightened properly or
the spring washer is missing allowing this arm to tilt into the inside of
the
drum.
