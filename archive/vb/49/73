I've thought about doing that...But it seems to me that it would require
the following steps:

Jack up one side of bus, remove wheel, remove fill plug
install wheel
fill, if you can get your hose into the gap between wheel and fill hole
jack up bus, remove wheel
install drain plug
install wheel
lower bus.
repeat for other side.

So i just sitck the rear up on jack stands, remove both wheels, and do it
all at that point.

Unless I'm missing something...neither my socket or my allen key fit into
the plug with the wheel in place...
