If you mean the vent window glass doesn't stay in the frame, but "sueezesz'
back out that 1/4 inch? If that's what you mean, it's a bear. But i put lots
of trim adhesive in the frame and take some rope or good twine and wrap it
around the frame and around the glass. Use a long screwdriver to apply a
tornequet to the fram and glass and twist until it is tight. Then wedge the
screwdriver in a good place and go to bed. In the morning it should stay
put. If not, do it 'till it does.
