While I know all these guys abhor an onslaught of emails praising their
concerted efforts, I do believe it deserves the HIGHEST praise.  

Therefore, I propose this Friday to be ADMIN PRAISE DAY!  

These folks deserve a special thanks for all the dedication and hard
work they have devoted, which largely goes unnoticed since the list runs
so smoothly. 

I propose only 2 rules:
1) that it only be limited to the normal Friday "bus stories and
sightings" hours and
2) that it be limited to stories of "rock and a hard place" and the list
saved my *ss or other stories of the camaraderie of this list which
cannot 'logically' be expressed to your co-workers:-).

Whadaya say folks?

Let's dedicate this Friday to PRAISE of the efforts that many put forth
to insure that I our buses are the joy that they are!

....Wait til Friday....and then...LET THEM HEAR IT!!!!
