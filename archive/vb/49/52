Subject: Road cow rescue/westy for sale

   It looks like the ROAD COW rescue is on, Jim Hall (aka; cheap transport)
is going to pick up the ROAD COW in the next day or so and bring it to
Havasu (Britt; contact me), but is also going to make a trip to the Taylor
bus farm to pick up yet another bus for me.  Rick has (had <:!) a 65 hardtop
Westy that will be coming to Havasu also. This bus IS FOR SALE (fried eggs,
not my style), I will have more info upon arrival. I know nothing of this
bus except it is pretty dry. I will have a complete report when it arrives
and will post a price. I can either sell as/is or do the brakes, get running
and make it a driveable beast. I might drag it to Pomona next weekend, if
not will have it at Buses by the Bridge VI for sale, you could even try it
out there (sleep in it)
