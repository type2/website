Subject: Bus clone for sale

On Thanksgiving we went to a fat tire bicycle ride.
There was plenty of people there with all kinds of old
bikes. I met a guy there that had is 1956 AUTO
UNION/DKW "kombi" there to transport his bikes. If you
never have seen one close up,let me tell you they are
crazy. Some of the things they have in common with the
bus is that they share the same headlight lens and
ring, just turned like a beetle. The rear reflectors
are similair to early bus, and it had bd style
ashtrays. Well anyways we got to talking and he has
another one that is for sale for a couple hundred
bucks or trade for a bus roofrack, he thinks that it
will fit on top of his dkw, I don't know. I went and
looked at it, and it is a project. Engine is out but
it comes with three in various states, different color
body panels, missing lights etc, etc, etc. Anyways, he
will only sell it through me cause he has burned
several times by VW people. Just kidding, email me and
I will pass on his info. It is in Sacramento and it
used to be a Locksmiths truck here in Sac.
 Mike
