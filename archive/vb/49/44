Hi, what is your serial number on case? Does it have
all the bastard goodies...ie BIG rear main
seal...strange heads ect ect...

Do you have the bastard heads with the small 2 bolt
cover just under the intake manifold holes right above
the valve cover?  Mine where missing and glued shut
with gasket maker yearrrrrs ago. I am looking for to
buy a set or borrow so i can fab some for mine.  Heck
even detailed pics would suit me.  Its all my orig
engine was missing.

A wood splitter huh?  HA HA HA!  Be very
careful...bastard engines where noted to make it much
past 40,OOO miles before total destruction.  If yours
is a bastard and still alive it may be on borrowed
time.  Would advise a tearn down ect before putting
into full use.  Once the bastard goes it 99% of the
time sends a rod through the case...breaks cranks cams
ect...its just a boat anchor then.

My bastard had 42K orig miles.  I took her down to
crank and went through the whole thing with NOS
everything. I was lucky my case was still tight.  I
figure I have another 40K of babying it to shows!

Would love to hear details and see pic of your engine.

Todd
