Josh,

You almost certainly have a virus. One of the stigmata of recent 
email viruses is that they include text from random files on your

Please don't go on line anymore until you've checked your 
machine with current anti-virus software and scrubbed it 
(preferably, format your drive and start over).

None of this has much to do with the vintagebus list.
