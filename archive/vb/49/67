Okay, those of you that have been around in the VW industry a while
might know this one.

The EMPI name went through this exact same situation a few years back. 
Lyle Cherry owned the name, but Mr. Bug started to use it.  When Lyle
sued, Mr. Bug won only because Lyle couldn't afford to keep fighting
them.  He even tried to make the name public, but failed to do so.  Now
Mr. Bug protects the name EMPI.  

So, if anyone wants to banish VW for their practices, that's fine.  But
any of you that do, you better not have a single EMPI part on your car
that was made after 1974!!!
