Subject: Vent windows!

Hey,

Workin' on changing door seals on my 63', and made the (mistake?) attempt to
change the seals that border the vent window to the vent window frame.  Boy
o boy, lotsa fun!  I had new locks to put in, and cracked the lock in my
attempt.  I have it rigged enough to the point that if I can get the window
completly in the frame, it should hold.

The problem is, IF I can get the window COMPLETLY in the frame!  Right now I
have it about 98% there, but it won't budge.  I have given it a rest for the
night, thinking maybe after a nights rest, it will be more coperative.

Has anyone any experience with this dilemma?  I have tried using a bit of
soapy water already, and this did help to get it where it is.

I'll try again tomorrow.....Just venting to an open audience.

Thanks

Kevin Abrecht
