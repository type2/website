Subject: RE: [VB] Alternator question EMERGENCY

I didnt see a response, so I thought I would chime in.

How about the voltage regulator (if one exists on a '63)??  I had a similar
situation on my daughter's pl*mouth a while back, and I replaced both my '67
bus before everything was happy.  I dont remember the circumstances on the
bus, but what you described was identical to my daughter's car.

Voltage regulators are pretty cheap ($15 or so at the neighborhood FLAPS);
and is worth a shot.

Here, I'll throw an emergency question out to all you experts.

I put my new engine in the '63 Sundial. When I fired it up the alternator
will start to charge (13 on the Vmeter), but when I roll out of the garage
the VDO volt meter goes only very slightly to the charge and if I turn on
the lights it goes strong to the discharge, and the Gen light glows dully.

I have put in all new wires in the engine compartment and to the starter. I
have replaced the Bosch New Man alternator with a new one with no change.

Help! Help!
