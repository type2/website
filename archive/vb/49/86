Subject: FW: [VB] Trailering Bus

The best way to get a bus from point A to point B is, in my opinion, a bus
tow bar.  They were advertised a few months
ago in Hot VW's.  One of my friends has a bus tow bar and in the last 2
years we've towed probably at least 10 different
buses for various reasons.  By far one of the most valuable tools I've seen
for bueses.  It's a one time investment for
a lifetime of care-free bus-towing.
