Martin,

You didn't describe where the knob is or how many you have.  On my 56, I have 
three knobs next to the heater control.  The one to the passenger side of the 
heater knob is for the fuel reserve.  Pull it up when you run out of fuel but 
don't forget to push it back in when you gas up or next time there will be no 
reserve.  This knob and it's use should be described in your owners manual 
(mine is).  There are two on the drivers side of the heater knob.  The one 
closest to the heater knob is for a manual choke to the carb.  Your '61 may 
have an automatic choke and no knob.  The one nearest the driver is for the 
auxiliary gas furnace that the vehicle had in it at one time.  Hope this 
helps.
