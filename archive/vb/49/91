Subject: Re: [VB] Trailering Bus

Michael-

I tow my busses on a 6000 pound capacity dual axle trailer.  No 
problem, the trailer is more than up to the task.  I think most dual 
axle trailers will probably be able to handle the load - most axles 
are 3500# capacity.  I have seen U-Haul rental trailers that look 
like they would be easily capable of the task.  The trailer will need 
to have it's own brakes, ideally electrically operated from the tow 
vehicle.  The other important thing (I think) is to have really good 
tiedowns.  I tow with a 2000 Ch**y half ton truck, and it does fine.
