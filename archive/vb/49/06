The difference is that nobody is going to mistake a HO-scale boxcar for 
a product of the BNSF railroad, nor would the BNSF be endangered 
legally by an accident involving one of these boxcars.  

The parts that folks would like to put VW logos on are not toys or 
miniatures, and they have definite safety issues associated with them 
that VW would not like to deal with.

Frankly, I'd just as soon not give VW the advertising.  Keep my 
mudflaps plain, please.
