In your cards and letters to the VWOA president (does anyone know his
name?) Invite him to add to their web site, an application for use of
the VW logo. Charge a nominal fee of $1, $5, $10. A small cost to VW.
They protect their copyright and everyone is happy. Probably cheaper
than paying the legal staff to chase us.
