I put Redline MT-90 in my bus and I like it better than the dino juice
GL4 that was in there before. It improved the shifting. As soon as I get
a few more miles out of the dino GL4 in my truck tranny it will be
getting Redline too. The price isn't that high when you consider how
long it stays in there.

One thing I've noticed is that the Redline does leak out a little faster
than the dino juice did. If you mail order it, get an extra quart or two
so you'll have some around to top off your tranny when it needs it.
