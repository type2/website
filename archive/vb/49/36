MEXICO CITY ? The era of peace and love really is over: the Volkswagen van that
took a generation on long, strange trips is going out of production in Mexico
at year?s end.

Sales are scheduled to halt at the end of December. And in Brazil, the only
other place where the boxy VW bus is still being made, union officials say they
suspect Volkswagen is planning to end production soon as part of cost-cutting
measures.

The van, known in Latin America as the Combi, was introduced in 1950.
Distinctive because of its air-cooled, rear-mounted engine, the van was last
offered in 1982 in the United States as the Transporter.
