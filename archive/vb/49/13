Subject: parts cleaning method?

He everybody.
I was asking a friend about rebuilding a carb, and
wether he recommended those "paint bucket" parts
cleaners. He said and old VW guy told him about this
method:

Take a big pot of water, get it to boiling on the
stove, pour one and a half lemons worth of lemon juice
in there, put the part in and let it boil for ten
minutes.
Of course he took the carb apart first, removing all
the delicate parts.

He said the carb came out looking brand spankin' new
(the pot was another story).

Has anyone tried this?

Can you confirm/deny that this is a good method?
