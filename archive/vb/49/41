BWWAAAHHHHHAAAHHHHHAAAAAAHHHHHAAAA!!!!
DUDE - FRIDAY is already over!  :)

Not ONE person on this list is gonna be able to get ANY lawmakers to listen
to their mosquito-like whining... satan-worshippin' treehugger Don Henley
can only get three or four to listen to his complaining that the Big Music
Companies and their copyrights are ripping off musicians. And that's coz
they get to tell legal secretaries, "Hey, I know Don Henley!" wink wink.
Check out the anti-copyright stuff at www.negativland.com.

Bus content? My ex once rode in a California bus while listening to
Negativland's "A big 10-8 place..."  if you pay attention, it told you
specific clues on how to drive across central Cali and actually get
somewhere!  She said it was a band members house.
