Subject: Re: [VB] Vent windows!

Hi Kevin,
I will be doing the same procedure as soon as my bus is painted.  I am more
concerned about getting the new latches installed in my vent frames, as both of
mine are broken.

BFY has a press like the one that is pictured in the Bentley book.  They will
press in new seals and your windwing glass for $15.  You can send them the
parts, they will install the glass and seals, and send it back to you.  Just a
thought.  Could you let me know if you had problems getting your new vent wing
latches installed?  I have a friend who just went through a Kombi completely,
and he told me that the hardest thing to do of the whole restoration was the
Vent Wings.

Good Luck,
Ed
