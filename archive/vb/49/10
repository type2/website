Here, I'll throw an emergency question out to all you experts.

I put my new engine in the '63 Sundial. When I fired it up the =
alternator will start to charge (13 on the Vmeter), but when I roll out =
of the garage the VDO volt meter goes only very slightly to the charge =
and if I turn on the lights it goes strong to the discharge, and the Gen =
light glows dully.

I have put in all new wires in the engine compartment and to the =
starter. I have replaced the Bosch New Man alternator with a new one =
with no change.

Help! Help!
