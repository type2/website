No, there isn't. You fill the Reduction Boxes til full (.53 pints, about 8
oz), then fill the center section til it begins dripping out of the fill
hole. I try to keep both the tranny and the the red-boxes level, in
road-position while filling. The center section takes about 5.3 pints, or
about 85 oz. or a bit more than 2.5 quarts. So the whole deal takes about
3 quarts total.
