Looked ALL over town and haven't been able to find any GL-4 Gear oil for =
my transaxle.  Only thing I have been able to find is the multi-grade =
stuff GL-3 thru GL-6 and synthetic stuff for GL-5.  Will any of this =
work or do I have to mail order some in?  Anyone ever used Redline =
products?  Heard good things about them on the water-cooled side.
