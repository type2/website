Dear xxxxx,

I purchased a Volvo rather than a VW due to your legal harrassment of
the vintage VW croud. Enclosed is a photo of me with my new Volvo in
front of my house.

Sincerely,
xxxxxxx

PS, Not only did you lose a sale, but you spent quite a bit on your
legal dept. to do so.


There is your letter,
Chris
The Steering Man
