Has anyone tried writing a letter to the president of VWOA to let him
know of the problem? He may be entirely out of the loop with a legal
dept run amuck. He might like to know how to save some money ( axe the
legal hacks) and make some money ( keep us happy, have us sell more
parts from their factories in Brazil, etc.).
