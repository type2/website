This is probably the issue. I will go through the fuse box this weekend. The
relay for high beams is probably toast too, as it a 6 volt unit. I need to
get this and install my 9 pin 67 box. The 9 pn 6 v is currently working,
sans er flashers, just a solid light for now. I really suspect bad ground to
drivers taillight, going to make a ground harness for both rears to body
ground for brighter rear lights. Also found a toasted wire to the front
parking lights to attend to, those things are SMALL guage!

Congratulations!

Whatever you do, don't forget to pay your exorcist in full and on time.
Otherwise you'll get re-possessed...

The headlight trouble is probably in the fuse box.  There are four fuses
for the headlights in all - low/high beam, left/right bulbs.  If the
fuses are OK, the contacts in the fuse box might be loose.  If you find
a loose contact, Eric&Barb recommend soldering *all* the contacts
together.  Use a heavy soldering iron and rosin-core or solid solder -
DON'T use acid-core solder!
