Naaw! I just support the car on the tranny support thingee after removing
both wheels (tires+rims), and fill'em. I support it so it's fairly level
and I will block up the box to near as possible normal level, which means
fighting the spring-plate tension! 

I don't get too strung out on exactness, I just try to give it a fairly
level fill. I suspect that it doesn't really matter one way or the
other. If you fill the boxes, they're full. Then you lower the bus back
down onto its rear wheels crawl under and fill the center. It's
full. Probably this is all it takes anyway.
