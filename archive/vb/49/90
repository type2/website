Subject: Re: [VB] Looking for a bus painter

I just had one bus rust repaired and painted and have a DC in there now.  I
have painted a number of cars in my garage and the painting part is fun,
but in order to paint one, you have to cover all your tools, hang plastic,
figure out some way of filtering the air unless you want dust and give the
garage cats dust masks (they hate that).

It is MUCH easier to let the pros do this and the painting part is really
pretty cheap if you have them to the rust and body repair too.  It is
SOOOOOO nice hauling a beat up, rusted out, multi colored, hammered bus to
the body shop then going back a few months latter and taking home a
BEAUTIFUL new bus!!!!!  I do my own mechanicals and reassemble, so there is
still plenty to do.

In my longer years, I used to tear into a car, do all the body and paint
and enjoy it, but now it seems my time that I have for such things is VERY
limited, and with the interest rates so low, I can now afford to have the
major work done.  And you just can't do body work little bits at a time,
but you can do mechanicals that way.

I think I am enjoying my busses even more now since I don't have all the
time, sweat and frayed nerves wrapped up in them.  By doing the work this
way, the finished product doesn't seem to far away, therefore the bus might
really get finished!!
