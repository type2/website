Denis is correct.  But, please do yourself a favor and educate yourself on the
products and safety procedures of the current products!  The epoxy based paints
contain a form of cyanide.  These paints MUST be used with a positive pressure
breathing system (hobby systems run about 400 bucks new) or you can seriously
damage your lungs.

Check out http://www.autobodystore.com   GREAT BBS and very knowledgeable pro
painters willing to answer any question.  Len who runs the site is a very
honest and helpful person.

I have no affiliation with the site BTW
