1. A typical bus weighs between 2300-2500 lbs.
2. Don't know, but it's not "over-wide".
3. Double would be fine.

Go for a U-Haul "AT" or similar rentable trailer if you plan to do this
just one time. A tow-bar is nice for frequent towing, but doesn't work
if the bus has flat tires, seized tranny, etc.

Good luck!

Hi All-

I am going to be renting a trailer to move a 65 bus a good 800 mile and
need to get a few spec's on what sort of trailer would be required. So
my questions

1. How much does a 65 Bus weigh (this is just a regular van- doesn't
have all the camper equipment in it)
2. How "wide" is the bus (i.e what sort of width would thr trailer have
to be)
3. Finally would a double axle trailer be sufficient or would a tri axle
be preferable?

Any other tips for a realtively inexperienced trailer tower would be
apprecaited.

Thanks

Michael

Honest to God, I'm telling you the truth, you can do it yourself. For
the
big money you will spend with a pro, you can do a pretty darn nice job
in
your garage. The products these days go on easy and dry in about an
hour. If
I was going to pay for anything, I'd pay for the body work. That's where
all
the time goes.
