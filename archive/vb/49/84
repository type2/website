Honest to God, I'm telling you the truth, you can do it yourself. For the
big money you will spend with a pro, you can do a pretty darn nice job in
your garage. The products these days go on easy and dry in about an hour. If
I was going to pay for anything, I'd pay for the body work. That's where all
the time goes.
