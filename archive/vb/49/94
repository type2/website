Subject: Re: trailering a bus 

We just pulled a 1605 mile  round trip first of Nov with a 58 Hard Top
Deluxe bus on board for more than half the journey( to Tampa by way of
Tallashassee from Highpoint Nc)  and then the 58 Binz on it from Tampa back
to here. My trailer is a 16 ft x 6.6 between the fenders double axle,
7500lbs total axle cap (2x3500). The kicker is to have enough ass in your
tow vehicle. I have pulled the same trailer with 2 different Bronco's and i
now use a 92 Ford F-250 Dually and a 5.8 v-8 gas. It's more stable pulling
than the others due to the dual wheels , but it can be pulled safely with a
single rear wheel vehicle , its just more exciting. Grin. As for tow bars,
not my cup of tea with all the bus wheels up on the trailer i don't have to
worry about something screwing up on the bus , but thats my opinion to each
their own ,,later
