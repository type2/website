Subject: RE: [VB] VIRUS

I don't think you can get a virus via 'preview' in outlook unless outlook
actually shows the contents... i.e. if you only see the icon of the infected
file along with the text portion of the email, you're probably safe or at
least I've never hit one yet.

Correct me if I'm wrong.

We just had fun ridding several systems of the SirCam virus... seems it made
it on a machine with out anybody really using it to do email!

>>>me too, and i've gotten it from a variety of sources.  it came through as
"re:" but even in the preview mode it showed an unopenable microsoft(?)
document. i couldn't delete without at least doing a preview, so sorry if
this effects anyone.
