Subject: RE: [VB] Re: electric fuel pumps / Gravity feed

A bus can also use gravity feed in a pinch!  I was in
a friend's '74 (stock dual carb type IV, I think) at a
rest stop on the Florida Turnpike on a Sunday night
when the fuel pump quit as we were pulling back onto
the highway.  The fuel pump on that engine is down low
and up front and not easy to get at.  Obviously the
Mobil station at the rest stop didn't have a
replacement part, and we didn't have money for a tow. 
So, we sacrificed the telescopic radio aerial to make
a piece of metal tubing which we used to join the
intake & outlet hoses going to the pump.  Pushed the
bus back up to the pump, topped off the tank, started
her up and drove another hour or two to my house.  It
ran so well the pump didn't seem necessary, but I
don't know if it would have kept going once the tank
got low.  Next day we rigged a cheap electric pump as
a quick fix and the bus went on.  I believe my buddy's
bus still has a coat hanger (hook included, for
honesty) as an antenna (but the noise of the electric
pump irritated him and he eventually put back a stock
pump, many, many miles later).
