Subject: re:Paint, insulation, "WB", first gear, plug wires

My bus has insulation in the front behind the kick panels, and up against
the front nose. It looks original. If I remember correctly it is the white
stuff (kind of like  a classic coffee cup) i dont think it is 1/4" thick. I
remember it being very thin, maybe 1/8". I have not seen any rust problems
associated with it.

as for downshifting into first...i have found this basically not possible,
unless practically at a complete stop.

i believe the wire holders i have are original, they dont seem to grab the
fan shround for too long before falling loose-until i push them back on.
anyway these will hold the bosch wires-it is just a little tight getting
them in. put them in carefully-once i actually pushed a little too hard-and
it cut the cover off a brand new wire.
