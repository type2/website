And if you look *very* carefully, the guy standing in front of the bus is
patiently waiting for AAA to show up and haul his rattle can painted heap to
the house so he can work on fixing the latest break down in time to make it
back to school/work the following Monday AM. He will fight off the ex-wife and
estranged kids and blow off studying in order to make it in time. The guy in
the Passat and gal in the NB will have plenty of time to study and steal the
dude's potential future job.
