Subject: Re: [VB] blowing hot air

I warned you it was a dumb question. So, you say yesterday was a scorcher in WA? You should come to
Atlanta some time and try this test. A pinhone in the shroud would probably blow the motor.

I guess the question comes down to hot day, keep the heat off, use available
air to cool engine. Or, hot day, turn the heat on, bake the driver and the
engine. Temp gauge seems to bear it out.
