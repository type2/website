Hi Jason,
Sounds like someone never bothered to clean out the debis in the bottom!

As long as you do not apply fire, sandblasting, acid or salt water to it.

Correct if it is really grungy as your's sounds.

 Does this horsehair compartment > come apart?

No, it will clean some with the kerosene and continue to clean with the 
action of the oil filtering air through it.

That one is for a Bastard 40HP engine and possibly very early 40 HP.  Which 
will run your engine too rich unless jetted especially for it.  Check the 
obsolete air cooled files through Thom's vintagebus webpage for the bus parts 
manual and see the aircleaner you need there.
