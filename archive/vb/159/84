Hi Gary,
The "Damage Numbers" catalog you view through vintagebus.com and click on the 
"Parts Manuals" there, shows a Dunlop white wall.
  Our 1966ish VW dealer accessory catalog shows:
ZVW 814 510  700 x 14 Semperit white tubeless for all type 2.
ZVW 814 520  700 x 14 Semperit white tubeless M & S for all type 2.
