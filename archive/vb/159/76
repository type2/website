Hi Matt,
It is stock for post-1963 buses.  So far we have not seen any rust develop 
out from this material apparently since styrofoam does not hold vapor in 
itself and seems to have enough venting between the styrofoam and sheet metal 
, though we have never removed it to completely check this out.

That is the sycros working to get both transmission gear shafts to the same 
simular RPMs before allowing the gears to engage.  You can get the downshift 
to work sooner at higher MPH by double clutching and spinning with the tranny 
in nuetral the gear shaft connected directly to the clutch up to higher RPM 
to match the gear shaft connected directly to the R&P.
