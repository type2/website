7 is the electromagnetic cutoff valve, the Bus won't start unless you give
it power, just wire it in with the choke.

Yes, it takes a little bit of cranking to fill an empty carb., but not that
much, maybe 4-5 seconds?  I usually crank it a bit with the coil wire off,
then let it sit for a minute, reconnect the coil, and fire it up.
