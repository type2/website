I second the Rancho thought. I rebuilt my tranny (freeway flyer) myself 
but purchased the parts from Rancho. They not only sold me the parts 
but they gave me lots of important advise. If I were to buy a rebuilt 
tranny, it would definitely be from Rancho. Their service is way beyond 
what I expected.
