I'd go easy with the rubbing compund. Its designed to take paint "off" so, if its already coming
off, rubbing compound will only enhance that condition.

If you want it shiny, wash it first with a stong detergent like purple power, then polish it, then
wax it. Meguiars has a good site on maintaining your finish.

  My Bus still has the OG Turkis paint on most of the body.  The OG
  Blauweiss is fading through in spots.  Would it be a good idea to
  use rubbing compound on the paint?  The immediate goal is to make
  it a little shinier, but I don't want to do anything that will make
  life hard for me when I eventually get this Bus repainted.
