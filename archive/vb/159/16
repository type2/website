   Vw Howard has begun the off road adventure and is allready half way
through the trip. It has rained the last few days and the desert roads are
nice and wet, no dust etc. I just talked to them and they were being winched
through a sandy wash!!!  (I had to hang back to wait for the new Bentleys to
arrive) It looks like he will be through the whole road in a couple more
hours. Not bad 75 miles offroad in 5 hours!!!!! We will be leaving Havasu
around Noon and will hook up with him along the route somewhere. 

   Type2parts.com will be closed from noon today till Monday morning. All
orders will be processed and shipped Monday.

thanks to all   ronnie   old volks of az
