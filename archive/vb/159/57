Subject: red/blue flasher 9 pin unit

Help again!

I've reconfirmed my wires with the diagram. My black/red wire running from
my brake light switch goes to the red flasher (49a) and the other B/R wire
goes to my fuse panel. When I hold the brake pedal down, it powers my turn
signal lights to burn (not flashing). Of course, the turn signal wires are
connected to the red flasher (riveted 49a) and the turns are grounded to the
front panel by the turn signal frame (not by wiring). Oh - and my
black/violet is also connected to red flasher (49a). Do I need to jerry-rig
a ground from my turns? Do I have an extra ground somewhere? Obviously I'm
powering my turns with my brake pedal!

Final note:  I have no other electrical problems. Parking, headlights, dash
lights, brake lights, emergency flasher, turn signals work properly.
