Though I generally don't question the Eric&Barm answers, I have to go
with the other option.  The '67 splash pan didn't have a "larger bubble"
(which I took to mean more room inside the pressed metal bubble of the
pan).  It has a cut-out in the back just big enough for the dual MC to
be exposed.  I have three '67s with this cutout.
