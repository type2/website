I can't comment on the mechanics of feeding one pump through another,
but here are a couple of thoughts: more pumps = more connections =
more leak points.  Also, if the stock pump has failed due to a broken
diaphragm, all you will do with the electric pump is pump gas into
the crankcase.  I'd vote for running the stock pump and keeping the
electric one in the spares box for installation if the stock pump
fails.
