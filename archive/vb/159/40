Subject: RE: [VB] Oil bath correctness & Cleaning?

Wouldn't the oil at the bottom of the air cleaner be meant to replace
this? Like cleaning and reoiling your K and N?>

A guy on the T3 list advised that the horsehair should be left alone and
not cleaned unless it is badly clogged. According to him, the oil
deposits on the horsehair are needed to trap contaminants.
