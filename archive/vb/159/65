Look at http://www.kymcovw.com/Media/pdfs/211953227b_inst.pdf , in
particular page 3.  All of these 7/9 prong box "replacements" have two
diodes (little plastic beads with wires on each end) mounted on the
board, but the Bus ones require another in-line diode that is mentioned
in the instructions.  If you don't have this "extra" diode you will get
the results you describe.

If the extra diode is not on the Bus and not in the parts bag, do this.
Go to Radio Shack and buy a package of 6-amp diodes, part number 276-1661.
Also get some push-on connectors if you don't have any handy.  Crimp a
female push-on on the end of the diode with the colored stripe.  Crimp
a male push-on on the end of a short piece of 18 gauge wire.  Put the
other end of the wire and the other lead of the diode together, twist
or solder them, and crimp a male push-on on this connection.  You have
now made a "diode assembly" as referred to in the Kymco instructions.
Follow their hook-up instructions and your lights should work.

Don't be surprised if your brake lights look dim after doing this.
The diode is good for a 1.0 - 1.1 V voltage drop, which is good for a   
20% - 30% brightness hit.
