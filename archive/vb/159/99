Subject: a deck too far?

ok, i am spending a rainy sunday doing misc. engine  calculations, 
and i had some q's about deck height.
please feel free to tell me when my math is in error :) but formulas 
are per berg.
ENGINE CC  is       1678.67 cc (88mm x 88mm x 69mm x .0031416)
SWEPT VOLUME   419.67cc  (ECC/4)
DECK VOLUME     20.38 cc   (88 x 88 x (deck height in inches, in this 
case .16 ) x 12.87)
HEAD CC              50cc each cylinder
COMPR RATIO      6.96:1  (50 + 20.38 + 419.67) / (50 + 20.38) = 490.05 / 70.38

now that .16 deck height sounds ridiculous! i've heard .09 is the 
most you want, but that gives me a CR of 7.83:1, waaaaaay too high.
i want as close to 6.9 as practical; i also don't want to prank w/ 
rocker geometry, but that big a barrel spacer amount  will likely 
lead to it.
semihemi cutting is not an option for a few reasons: out of money, 
and B) ronnie confirms what another bus friend of mine has observed: 
semihemi heads run hotter on busses. DATA (not opinions) to the 
contrary are welcome, but the $$$ to send these heads out again is 
non-existant....

so - anyone out there space a cylinder out this much, and what 
problems arose? is my math wonky? any other approaches to lowering CR?

i gotta say, i expected my head ccs to go up when i expanded the bore 
from 88.5, but i am assuming they bored a bit farther into the head 
to assure a flat seat, and took out enough metal to result in placing 
the head closer to piston, thus cancelling the addiional bore ccs.
