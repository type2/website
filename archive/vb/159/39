Subject: Re: [VB] Oil bath correctness & Cleaning?

A guy on the T3 list advised that the horsehair should be left alone and not cleaned unless it is
badly clogged. According to him, the oil deposits on the horsehair are needed to trap contaminants.

I soaked mine in really hot water, sprayed it with Foamy engine bright,
and lots of simple green in the h20. Then I just kept dunking it until
it was clean, then soaked more, dunked, rinced with hose, and let dry. I
srubbed the pan clean, and tubes. The horsehair part would open simply
for me, so I left it intact. The hair became a nice brown again.
