This is BYU, you are *very* confused.

Actually the Passat and NB will be in the shop on numerous factory recall=
s
soon, most of which involve fuel problems that could lead to death in a
minor fender bender.  Judging by the prevelence of VW dealership service
complaints on the in-ter-net, they will probably miss the rest of the sem=
ester.
