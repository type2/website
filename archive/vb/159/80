Hi Tom,
From what he writes "When I hold the brake pedal down, it powers my 
turnsignal lights to burn (not flashing)." it sounds like he only has brake 
lights and no flashing turn signals when brakes are applied.  Having both 
constant brake lights while signaling should only happen on semaphore and 
1961-1971 Euro taillights since these had seperate brake lights.
