Subject: RE: [VB] '67 splash pan

Hi Jim,
I have a 67 Sundial, also missing the splash pan.

Is there a possibility that you (or anyone that has the correct splash pan
on their 67 bus), could post a photo of it.  Eventually, I hope to replace
my splash pan, and if I can simply find a splash pan from another year and
produce the cut-out that you speak of, it would be really helpful.

Thank you,
Ed Richardson
