No; and if your M/C is shot (like mine is), you are stuck with either
replacing it for $150-$175 (it is a one-year, phase of the moon special
order item after all), or retro-fitting a 71 and later bug M/C with some
modifications.

There is a really good article in the type 2 library that talks about the
conversion that Eric & Barb put together a while back.

I opted to bite the $150 bullet, figuring that if the one on there now made
it 20+ years (I have records indicating it was last changed in 1981), the
odds were pretty good this would be a one time thing for me.  The part
should have made its way from the left coast by next Monday or Tuesday.

I miss driving the bus (heavy sigh)
