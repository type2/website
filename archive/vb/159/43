Subject: Re: [VB] Friday old photographs 

I'd also like to leet everyone that I posted a photo that Christian "Fig"
Figenschou sent me. The photo has been added to the Vintagebus.com Gallery
section. Full credit and details have been attributed to fig.
Search for key words "Brick bus" without the quotes.
Thanks for sharing with us, Fig! =) I for one always enjoy learning/hearing
about VWs around the world.
