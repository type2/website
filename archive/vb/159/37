Subject: RE: [VB] Oil bath correctness & Cleaning?


I soaked mine in really hot water, sprayed it with Foamy engine bright,
and lots of simple green in the h20. Then I just kept dunking it until
it was clean, then soaked more, dunked, rinced with hose, and let dry. I
srubbed the pan clean, and tubes. The horsehair part would open simply
for me, so I left it intact. The hair became a nice brown again.
