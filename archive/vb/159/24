Well, It was hot this summer in Montana and when I opened the engine at a
gas stop I was appalled to see a heater tube loose in the engine bay.
Despite this, the dipstick was still at its normal "I can hold it but
I don't want to hold it for too long" temperature.

It might have made a difference, but I got lucky that time.
