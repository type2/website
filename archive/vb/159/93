Subject: Sunroof Slider Rebuild Kits

Hi,

Does anyone know where I might be able to find a split-window sunroof slider 
rebuild kit?

Wolfsburg West, California Import Parts, and West Coast Metric seem to be 
out of them.

The kit contains Tephlon replacements for the front outer sliding blocks, 
the rear bow sliding blocks, and the rear outer stabilizer tabs, and 
includes all of the mounting hardware.
