Subject: Re: [VB] Roof top tent

Gorgeous, and it would match so much nicer on my green sundial. Has anybody
got any pics of the straight up version? the one I've seen on brochures with
a striped tent on a full length rank? I take some comfort in having found
plans for a car top tent in a 1953 popular mechanics rag.
