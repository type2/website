Subject: Oil bath correctness & Cleaning?

Alright. I'm putting the engine back in DARTHVW and
I'd like to use the oil bath air cleaner which came in
the "spare parts" box with the bus.
I just installed a new carb, and putting the paper
baja bug style cleaner back on it irks me.
But, I took the old oil bath out and it looks totally
Jurassic inside.
There is a cake of gunk in the bottm, which looks like
clay. The top of the honeycomb compartment is all
dusty, and it looks like the horsehair in there is
nasty.

How long do these things last?
I read the cleaning instructions in the library. Seems
like you use Kerosene? Does this horsehair compartment
come apart?

Finally, is this even the correct cleaner for my 67
Bus?
The bottom "bathtub" is about 7.5" across, with the
spout coming out with the weighted flap and a 1"
outlet near the end. The part markings are: 1GM 4087S
211 129 613 B

I've got a long weekend ahead.

It hangs from a bracket on the right side, looking
into the engine compartment.
