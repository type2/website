Volks,

I work here at BYU in the law library.  The university is breaking ground =
on Monday for a new indoor practice facility so that team has a better =
chance at winning the December bowl games.  By Dec. the ground is frozen =
and it is too cold to practice outside around here.  Hence the facility.

What does this have to do with Bugs n Busses?  Hey, its Friday.  Click on =
the web site below and scroll down to the third picture.  Click on the =
picture and you will get the blow up.  Note the VW wasser bug in the =
parkinglot of the achitects rendering of the new facility!  We all know =
they should have used an old splittie instead!
