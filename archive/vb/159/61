Hi Thomas,
Sounds like you need to ground wire the taillights to the negative battery 
cable body bolt.  ALL buses need this to get the brakes/signals/running light 
to work properly at all and VW finally in 1970ish did a factory ground wire 
system to fix this problem.  
  If the problem persists after installing a ground wire system for the 
taillights you need to clean and make sure the front signals are grounded 
properly.
