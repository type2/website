Subject: 4 busses for sale in GA

I went out to get some parts yesterday from my favorite VW shop in Austell, GA and the owner said he
had 4 busses for sale.

One is kind of work truck or camper or something. Its a 62 and looks like a regular Kombi but, it
has crank out windows that look like they were fitted into the regular cut-outs for the windows.
They aren't jalousie windows, they have 2 panes and it looks like they pivot at the top and bottom
instead of the sides. Has anybody ever seen these?  The guy said he thought it was original that way
and was made to be a work truck of some kind. Its got the front seats but the cargo area is
stripped. He says it runs. He's asking $1,500.00

He has 2 '65 Kombis. One has the original middle seat and looks pretty good except some body damage
to the left rear corner. This one doesn't have much rust and he says it runs. The other '65 is
pretty rusty on the outside and I didn't look on the inside. He says this one also runs. He wants
$1,500 for the good one and will take $800.00 for the rusty one.

The other one is a '67 Kombi. This one has the original middle and back seat and looks good on the
inside and out with some miscellaneous stuff missing, like the front turn signal light assy. This
one doesn't have much rust and it has a 1600 DP that runs. He wants $1,500.00 for this one.

If you are interested contact Tim (you have to ask for Tim, Sr., his son works there and his name is
Tim too). 770-941-1870. He doesn't have a web presence so I doubt he will have pics available. If
you are out of town and are interested, I can go out and snap some for you.
