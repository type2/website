I would put the van into first gear while the engine is running, hold down
the brakes, then let up on the clutch.  If dies right away, then your clutch
is good, if it keeps running/revving, then your clutch is shot, and I would
look at that.  That's an easy test, and with as much fluid leaking as you
said it did, it's quite possible that the clutch is soaked.
