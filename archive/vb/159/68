Subject: Re: Dreaming my AZ off! - Your choice to pick...

In last weeks' therapy session I expounded on my recent dreams. I asked the
collective "you" to vote on which of the following six Fruedian examples that
you wanted me to go off on.

Recap and Results:
1. Bright lights and Duane Allman's Mansion.
2. Karmann Ghia mishap.
3. Shoe Shopping and Pink balloons.
4. What once was Gay is now only Disco. (Heather Locklear wants me but I'm
married...)
5. I used to have a career plans but ended up at Boeing.
6. Fear of the Four Horsemen, 50-something stupid votes, and oral in the oval
ruined our Country.

1 = 3
2 = 2
3 = 2
4 = 5
5 = 4
6 = 4

Within your varied responses, I have been reminded of political correctness,the
dangers of offending the GLADD community and straight women, ignoring,
slandering or maligning the virtues and sacrifices of the Viet Nam Veterans
and/or the basic planks of the GOP, was encouraged toward and dissuaded from
preaching on about a variety of religious and theological stances and received
a batting list of career seeking/forming/abandoning/retaining impressions.

Overall, I'd say that my dreams are not politically correct and surmise that
neither are yours. My career sucks and most probably yours does too compared to
the self-belittling goals that you had planned on back in high school,
bootcamp, third year of law school or during your residency. Religion? F that,
I strive for spiritual enlightenment and eternal life. I have faith in one and
don't expect the other- not in that order. Veterans? Well, I have learned that
if it has served it's Country then salute it. If it has not then try to
understand why, when, where, what and that this ball game ain't over yet. Jesus
loves you and so do I. Ask if you have more questions but it ain't my thing to
push/kick in the door. 
Things have changed within this past week. A life long friend lost a long time
friend and coworker in a split instant. A safety saint lost his life due to
someone's failure to act safely. I will let the details slip but not the
resepect. I wrote an eloquent email that perfectly captured my feelings and
wishes to be forwarded to his co-workers. As I was reaching for the "SEND"
button, the message was lost in an instant. I accidentally dislodged the cord
to the network. Somehow it seemed eerily appropriate. I had my moment of outlet
and let it go all unsaid~ never sending my thoughts and condolences. Blue and
two wheels always has my respect. I will leave it at that and fall back. I
think the exercise was for me anyway. 
What was Gay is now Disco was to me a funny thought and a editorial comment on
modern life, not a slam against my family and friends who believe differently
than I. It was only a smart aleck title for my discomfort in a changing world.
I blinked twice and woke up old school. Close cropped hair, shaving of all body
hair, popularity of small whimpy dogs, Boy bands singing soprano, men wearing
make up and piercing their nipples~ and worse..., people calling themselves
Wicken and living with Mom and Dad until age 35 was a little off in my day.
Excuse me if I prefer women, old Merle Haggard on vinyl while staring at saw
dust over polished concrete floors, defending the second amendment- not to
mention your and my liberties as I perceive them, keeping my vehicles and self
original equipment, simultanteously respecting Ted Nugent, Billy Graham and
Jimmy Carter, enjoying the same centerfold month after month and teaching basic
Protestant truths to my kids. That all seems normal to me. 
Even though we differ, it doesn't mean that I don't love you, fault you if you
prefer making love to flaming chainsaws or rabid porcupines instead of a
faithful woman. Just be safe and honor yourself. If you need help then call. I
will still drink a beer with you, lend a shoulder in confidence and be the
first to rescue you when your VW breaks down (again) in the driving rain.
Heather Locklear might want me but I'm taken.

1. Bright lights and Duane Allman's Mansion.
2. Karmann Ghia mishap.
3. Shoe Shopping and Pink balloons.
4. What once was Gay is now only Disco. (Heather Locklear wants me but I'm
married...)
5. I used to have a career plans but ended up at Boeing.
6. Fear of the Four Horsemen, 50-something stupid votes, and oral in the oval
ruined our Country.

1 = 3
2 = 2
3 = 2
4 = 5
5 = 4
6 = 4

Only 1, 2 and 3 (with out the balloons) were real dreams. The others were pure
flamebait.
