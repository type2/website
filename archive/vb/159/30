Scott, once I got up to Wisconsin a day early for the bugfest and thought I 
would check out Mofoco's shop not a lot to see out in front of the counter, 
but I do remember someone trying to bring back a rebuilt IRS bus tranny that 
they had bought there and installed to find out it wasn't right, and it 
didn't sound like they were having much luck with the exchange. I think I 
would spend a little extra money on shipping and get one from someone out 
west like Rancho. Doug Lewis
