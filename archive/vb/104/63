Subject: Interior Panels

So I got myself a sub hatch westy...a 61 SO-34 to be precise.  Some of the
interior panels got wet due to bad seals and have rotted and/or are falling
apart.

First of all...the center headliner panel that includes the sub hatch.  90%
of this panel is perfect, but one of the corners of the sub hatch must have
leaked at one time, and a corner of it is rotted.  Right by where the rear
latch for the sub hatch is to be specific.  Can I match this panel to the
others?  What type of wood should I use?  I'm assuming its the same as the
other door/interior panels.  Do I have to do anything special to it to get
it to bend, or just screw it in place and its good?  Stain?
Mr. Davis...what did you do for your 59?

I also need to replace the front door panels, but I'm thinking of just going
with the grey pressboard kombi style panels.  Thats what the front kick
panels are, so it wouldn't look out of line.  The panels on the cargo doors
and the wall opposite the cargo doors also need to be replaced.  All of the
others are fine.  Those shouldn't be that hard...I just don't know what I
should use for materials.

Along with this...the bus is getting a bunch of new seals.

Any tips or comments are appreciated.
Thanks,
Isaiah
