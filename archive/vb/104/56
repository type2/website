Look at all the tin with a jaundiced eye.  Any cracks should be brazed up.
You will probably find cracks on the cylinder tin.  Brazed tin very seldom
requires any further repairs, as the cracking will relieve stresses and
the brazing process will tend to anneal the metal.

Also check the heater
boxes, particularly around where the pipe goes in and out.  If the housing
is loose, make some split collars out of sheet metal and braze them around
the pipe to increase the bearing surface.

Replace all the engine bay seals, of course.
