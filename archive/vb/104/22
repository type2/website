Hi everyone,
Monday's here finally. After the long weekend, I'm finally able to interpret 
exactly what the hell went on this past weekend.
I'll make the answer to the question quickly before I post my trip report.

Although the ease of our group getting in was nice, I believe the show was 
pretty organized this year. With the swap meet inside and cars off the lawn 
it made for an organized event because cars had to be lined up along the 
street inside. They show was forced to keep everything lined up. Mostly 
everything from busses to splits, to the swap meet was in easy view of each 
other, quick access to vendors, and ease of leaving after the day was over 
made for a great day. 
Although car attendance seemed slightly lower this year, possibly due to last 
years confusing day, it was great this year.

Anyways, hope everyone else had a great Red Barn/KP weekend, I know I did 
(and still feeling it).
Trip report coming soon.....
