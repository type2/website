it was said ....
 Most people jam plastic fuel filters in the line between the pump and
carburetor

When I rebuilt my engine a little over 2 years ago (my oh my, how time
flies) I put the fuel filter behind the tin, about 10 inches from the tank.

The guy at the FLAPs suggested it and it seemed to make sense to have fewer
points of potential fuel line failure where the engine is hottest.  Although
I have no point of reference (my first-ever VW), things appear to run just
fine.

All this talk reminded me that its time to replace the lines (I promised
myself I would do this every two years).
