I followed the oil cooler seal thread over the weekend and ended up looking a one of the web references quoted. It mentioned the L-piece of tin fitted to the bottom of the oil cooler, which I am sure I did not ever have in my stock pile nor did I put on the '67 Westy dual port engine. Went out last night to the garage and looked at the spare dual port but only half of the original piece was there so will have to make my own and install.

Any idea how much increase engine temp this is responsible for if missing?

Thanks again for the great info.......
