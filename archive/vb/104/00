Subject: Front bumper brackets needed

Hi list!

Took my bumpers in for powdercoating, and the front bumper brackets 
disappeared.  Does anybody have an extra pair I could buy?  If you 
do, plmk asap, as there is a car show here in town this weekend, and 
I want to make sure splittys are properly represented.

BTW, PPG powdercoat sky white looks like a pretty close match for 
silverwhite for the bumpers.
