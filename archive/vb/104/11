Subject: Re: [VB] Paint Cracks

I will admit that I made those same cracks in my do-as-you-learn body work
days. The Cracks are probably caused by the weld on the repair panels not
holding and cracking the thin bondo and the paint. There is no way to fix it
except to grind down everything and repair the weld properly.

I learned all this the very hard way.
