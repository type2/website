Subject: RE: [VB] IRS on a Split

The IRS conversion is such a variable thing it is hard to say what is right
or wrong depending on the path you want to go down.

The only Thing components I know of that are used in a regular swap is the
IRS tranny and/or inner flanged for the CVs.  I have never seen Thing CVs
used.  Normally people use the baywindow CVs 28 degree working angle or the
T4 CVs with a 32 degree working angle (expensive like $75 each).

Check out Bus Boys for details on what seems to be the route you are going.
Volksworld did a DIY article on this a while ago as well.

From my research you will need to buy modified axles, control arm mounts
(clamp on or welded), and maybe spring plates.

Old Speed has a stock height kit that uses Beetle stuff...  Which means you
can put early 944 rear brakes on it :)   Or T3 brakes.

The shop talk forum usually has loads of custom information if you want to
check it out.
