Subject: east coast show

Well while most of you were enjoying yourselfs at the west coast show
we had a show here in NJ.
i went to sell and see what i could find
saw a 67 3/4 middle seat for 175..  good frame bad upolstry
there were about 12 splits in the show, {this is east coast after all}
there was one bus in the swap that made me say WTF
it had the non walkthru panel with the spare tire hump welded in and bondoed 
across the back from tail light to tail light.
it looked like the american cars that had the spare on the bumper{ but not 
quite}
real hack job.
old bearded man driving
i sold some stuff made some money
and then i went shopping, didnt really see anything i needed
but i did buy one thing
this guy had a 2110 cc motor {apart} just the short block
{no flames on the reliabity or non stock aspect please}lol
i know, i know.
but for what i got and the price i couldnt go wrong
and it will give me something to play with
it is a AS-41 case clearanced and bored
an 82 mm counterwieghted crank
weber cam

the case looks very good (yes i know what to look for)
the cam and crank look brand new

his friend had it running for 8 months and ate a valve
now for my question 
i would like to put it together the way it is ( maybe milder cam)
and maybe it'll end up in my double cab for awhile
now what would some of you recomend for the other parts needed to biuld it
(i have a set of brosals and a set of kadrons would these work on a motor of 
this size?
let me know what you think
oh by the way i paid 110 bucks for it and also got a gold iridite 36 horse 
style shroud with the dog house style cooler on the back and a almost new 
alternator with it.
