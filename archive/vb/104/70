Hi Michael,
1.  Retorque all engine case fasteners.

2.  File/saw out all casting flashing in the heads and cylinder fins.

3.  Check that the rear tip of the boden tube points right at the eye of the 
clutch arm on the tranny.  If not replace clutch arm with curved or straight 
model which does, or enjoy wearing out clutch cables every 6,000 miles or so 
on the tip of the boden tube.

4.  You might also want to look into installing a 15 gallon 1968-71 bus gas 
tank.
  It is so nice to go from 200+ mile range to well over 300!

5.  Check RGB to swing plate bolts for tightness and repair any threaded 
holes that are stripped out.

6.  If it turns out you need to remove the RGBs from the swing plates, go 
ahead and remove the tranny and/o if need to do repairs on the tranny while 
it is out.  Replace all shift bushings in the shift tube and replace the end 
boots to this tube.

7.  Check endplay and replace FW seal with red silicon seal that does not 
harden up like others do in 30,000 miles.

8.  Replace the tranny input shaft seal if unknow age or leaking badly.

9.  Clean out engine compartment, especially in front of the gas tank.  We 
sprayed a hose up around the tank.  Out came alot of paper and even a 3/4" 
square chunk of engine block laying up there!

10.  Take your time and do it right.
