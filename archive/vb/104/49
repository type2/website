Subject: Things to do while yanking my engine

Hullo, list.

After owning Patience for a year and a half I am pulling the engine (my first) 
to do a myriad of things.

The main reasons are to chase down a persistent oil leak on the left side 
(guessing oil cooler on the 1600dp), get Time-Serts put in the #2 and #3 
sparkplug holes, putting in new engine tin seals, and put in air flaps in the 
fan shroud.  

"While I'm at it," I am planning pressure washing it, on getting new exhaust 
valves put in (no idea as to the old ones' mileage -- no stretching yet), 
checking on the existence of a Hoover bit, flushing the oil cooler, check on 
the clutch, checking the endplay, and replacing the crankshaft seals.

Can anyone recommend some other common items I should check on or do "while I'm 
at it?"

TIA
