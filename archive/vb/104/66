... nah its not that bad.  I can reach behind the tin to get to it.  Its a
bit of a PITA, but I figured the inconvenience was worth the added safety.

Hi Rich,
Does your fuel filter placement require you to remove a lot of tin, or even
drop the engine, in order to change the fuel filter?  How accessible is it
in it's new location?

Thanks,
Ed
