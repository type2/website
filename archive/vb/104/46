<< I followed the oil cooler seal thread over the weekend and ended up 
looking a one of the web references quoted. It mentioned the L-piece of tin 
fitted to the bottom of the oil cooler, which I am sure I did not ever have 
in my stock pile nor did I put on the '67 Westy dual port engine. Went out 
last night to the garage and looked at the spare dual port but only half of 
the original piece was there so will have to make my own and install.

maybe easier to weld a bit onto what you have.  I've seen them with the arm 
fallen off now and then.

 Any idea how much increase engine temp this is responsible for if missing?

I wondered this myself.   I think this is one of those things where every 
little thing adds up and acts synergetically, and finally it all fits 
together and bang you got it.    Like with the sealing engine compartment 
thing, where you have to get enough in to make the next one make difference.  
for me with my 65 the last engine compartment seal I installed was the one 
around the door, and man next time I drove that bus the heat had twice the 
volume- from pressurising the engine compartment.  But I think everything 
else was already there.  So you can't point at that from any one piece- it 
all added up to make it work right.
