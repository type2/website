If that piece or it's "arm" is missing then there will be a gap ~ 3/8" x
2-1/2" just before the cooler at the bottom which will let some cooling air
escape back into the engine compartment.  I wonder if this piece shouldn't
have some foam seal on it also to stop air escaping around it.  I have seen
some that had the remnants of foam on them.  The "Hoover bit" used to be
hard to find but with the current crop of beetles hitting the junkyards you
should be able to locate one along with the shutters that were also hard to
find at one time.  Look for fuel injected beetles as I think that they were
relatively untouched until after people got wise to the need for the Hoover
bit and shutters.

 Any idea how much increase engine temp this is responsible for if missing?

I wondered this myself.   I think this is one of those things where every
little thing adds up and acts synergetically, and finally it all fits
together and bang you got it.    Like with the sealing engine compartment
thing, where you have to get enough in to make the next one make difference.
for me with my 65 the last engine compartment seal I installed was the one
around the door, and man next time I drove that bus the heat had twice the
volume- from pressurising the engine compartment.  But I think everything
else was already there.  So you can't point at that from any one piece- it
all added up to make it work right.
