Subject: Finding a bus on the west coast

Hi,

I am loking for a pre-67 vw bus on the west coast. I
don't have any contacts out there so I have no one to
look the bus over to make sure I'm not getting a
lemon. I'm not able to fly out there either. Are there
any folks out there that can look a bus over for me
before I have it shipped? Thanks in advance for any
help.

Mike
