Fuel leaks are #1 problem. Your gas tank hose needs to be top shape, ALL THE
TIME. Next, your fuel line from the fuel pump to the carb. And lastly a
leaky carb and/or intake manifold(s).

Been there, done that, got the tow home and then to the wrecking yard. Bye,

I've heard comments on busses/type 2's being prone to catching fires.  What
are the reasons/causes and how can we be proactive in preventing our
chariots from catching fire?
