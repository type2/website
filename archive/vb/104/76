That is what this piece is known as since Mr. Hoover expounded at length on
it's virtues relative to the lifespan of your aircooled T1 engine.  Try
this:

Funny thing is that right after posting the info below I went to get some
tin welded up for a T4 cooler conversion and had some time to kill while
waiting for it to be done.  Of course I went up the street to the Oakland
Pick and Pull junkyard and while there what do I find?  Why a long block
that someone had pulled from a '67 beetle.  It had the doghouse setup and
the really funny part is that someone took the shroud and all the tin but
left a perfect Hoover bit:)  It also had a really nice breather with the
drip tube that I might get tomorrow when I finish pulling out the rest of a
BA6 heater that was in an aircooled Westy Vanagon.  Sometimes you just have
a really good day at the bone yard.

BTW, anybody need a BA6?
