Years ago I got tired of worrying about fuel lines wearing through and such.
I decided that the best way was to route and clamp a steel line to the frame
and terminate up near the engine. A short piece of German braided line went
from the tank to the new steel line. For my benifit only, because I pull
engines a lot to change stuff and swap things, I install a Harley Davidson
inline fuel disconnect with the male end mounted to the grommet hole of the
front tin on the engine and the female end attatched through a short piece
of hose to the new steel tank line. I just slide my new engine in and plug
in the fuel line, quick and easy.

All my engines and dune buggy engines get the same fuel line connector, the
Dune buggy engines also get a large cannon plug for quick electrical
disconnect.

it was said ....
 Most people jam plastic fuel filters in the line between the pump and
carburetor

When I rebuilt my engine a little over 2 years ago (my oh my, how time
flies) I put the fuel filter behind the tin, about 10 inches from the tank.

The guy at the FLAPs suggested it and it seemed to make sense to have fewer
points of potential fuel line failure where the engine is hottest.  Although
I have no point of reference (my first-ever VW), things appear to run just
fine.

All this talk reminded me that its time to replace the lines (I promised
myself I would do this every two years).
