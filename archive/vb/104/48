I have removed enormous amounts of filler/fiberglass with a plumbing
torch...heat causes it to just fall off (with a little help from Mr.
Screwdriver).  This process probably saved me 20 hrs. of grinding.
Obviously use caution regarding fumes and overheating metal.

Hi all,

With all this body talk, I was wondering how to remove fiberglass from a
PO genius idea for body work.  Instead of filler, they used fiberglass
in some areas.  I want to remove the fiberglass, and have the dents
pulled right (front nose).  What should I use?  Is there any chemical
like paint remover?

Thanks,
Aaron
