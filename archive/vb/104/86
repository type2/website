Hello

I'm collection information, before I'm starting on the project, so....

To do the work with stock height, I'm been told that I have to use "Thing" =
(181) CV Joint to get the greater angel.
Beside this I will use a 1303S gearbox, and my plan was to use the rear of =
a '68-'69 baywindow.
But I might have a chance to buy a garbage Thing from '76 (It's with large =
5 bolt lugs).=20
How much of this could I use (can I use the drums / backing plate / house /=
 diagonal arms / gearbox and so on) ?
