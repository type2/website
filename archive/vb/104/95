Subject: Re: [VB] Finding a bus on the west coast

The west coast is a big place.  You're better off finding
a candidate first, and then asking if there's someone in
the area who can check it out.

The best thing to do is ask for a lot of pix of the bus,
from all angles, top and bottom, before you send someone
on a mission.    And you need to be a stickler on the 
pix: I've found sellers will conveniently "miss" bad
sections of the car.  They they don't give you a comprehensive
set of pix, walk away.
