Finally got the the white oak slats I needed to restore my original Westfalia roof rack on Friday and spent a portion of the weekend to put it all together. Looks great and worth the wait!!! 

And now for the best part...... I was told today that the replacement white oak slats I received to put my roof rack back together are in fact original VW. They came from the local VW dealerships interior ceiling when they tore it down to remodel last year!!!

Works for me....
