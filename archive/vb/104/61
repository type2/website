There are lots of places to burn from.  The rotten hose.  Where it goes
through the front tin and there hasn't been a grommet there for years so
the tin eats through the metal line.  The next spot is pretty good if you
have the old pimmed in brass tube for an inlet fuel pump.  If that pops
off the gas just drains from the tank onto the engine.  Barry knows all
about this.  He did a real nice job on his new 67 though.If the other side
pops off it's not quite so bad.  Most people jam plastic fuel filters in
the line between the pump and carburetor using no hose clamps.  I've never
heard of any trouble with this but never have tried it.  Then there is
that little brass tube that goes into the carburetor.  JP has done this one
on the way back from Jerome and lived to tell about it.  I try to safety
wire the hose clamp there to one of the top screws in hopes that at least
it won't just pop loose and spray down the engine.
About hoses.  I know I was complaining about wipers not lasting too well
the other day.  I'm also not real impressed with GERMAN gas line nowdays.
I'm still using it, but it sure rots out quick.  Gas has changed a lot in
the last few years.  They use this line on Jettas and stuff right?  I
don't see how domestic fuel line could be any worse?
Anyway spring is here, it's time to think about gas lines and fires and
fire extinguishers.
