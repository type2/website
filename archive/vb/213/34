Subject: 57 brake question

I have a '57 that's in need of some new front brake cylinders, but
they seem to be next to impossible to find and when I have found some
they're $$$'s. Anyhoo, whats involved if I wanted to upgrade to later
brakes, 62-67 I think?

I'm thinking cylinders, shoes, drums?, backing plates?

Thanks!
