Oddly, I didn't find this.  They have no "tooth" in loose conditions which
means that they won't dig a hole when they spin.  For someone with a "keep
it rolling" technique in loose stuff they work well on an underpowered
vehicle like a bus.  Here in SoCal, we deal with a lot of sand, but not
much mud.  I don't think that I'd like them in slippary mud.
