Here in Oklahoma, until a couple of years ago, commercial registrations
were hundreds of dollars cheaper than passenger-car registrations.  The
standards of being "commercial" were not very high, so just about every
Joe Smith with a truck registered it to "The Joe Smith Co." and got
commercial tags.  The colors were the same, but the number sequence was
different.  They also required a "Commercial Vehicle" sticker.  The fees
were finally lowered, and the standards for being "commercial" raised,
so this is nowhere near as common as it once was.

Another popular way to dodge the fees was to get a tribal tag, but you
had to know someone that was qualified in order to do that.
