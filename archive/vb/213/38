Hi Jason,
For an exploded view of the brakes the VW Bus parts manual you can access 
through Thom's Vintagebus.com website is the only view of that we know of.

 If not id REALLY like to know what tools i should have. Im going to buy a

The best thing to have is a 11mm brake line wrench or failing that a good 
vise grip to break the break lines loose without smearing the hex of the 
brake line nuts.  Once broken loose and taken apart any joints in the braking 
system you should grease or anti sieze all the male threads of the brake 
lines to prevent corrosion and make it easier on yourself or the next owner 
when this has to be done again.

We always used a normal cresent wrench and with the standard locking tab in 
place the inner nut stays put when we tighten the outer.  You can replace the 
twin locking nuts and plates with a 1968-71ish bus front spindles locking 
nuts set which vice lock on the spindles with a allen bolt setup.
  Make sure to replace the flex lines if they are five years or older or of 
unknown age.  It probably is a good time to repack the front wheel bearings.
