Subject: Re: [VB] California "Pink" slips

Funny thing I've noticed about CA titles and regs. when it comes to trucks.....most 1/2 or 3/4 ton trucks are registered as "commercial" vehicles on the title.  My 93 Ford p/u had the same "commercial" on the title.  Also had a 62 Singlecab in Vegas with a "commercial" CA pink slip.

Another thing I've noticed is that alot of buses with og black or og yellow plates have "commercial" truck plate number sequences.  My 63 EZ Camper has normal "passenger" car black plates with the AAA 123 sequence.

Most panels and trucks have the truck plates with an A12345 or 12345A sequence.

I can understand Kombis and Deluxes being considered a pass. vehicle, but the strange thing is my camper was originally a Panel.  Maybe the dealer made the distinction when sending in the registration.  Mike Alcorn's Sundial also has the pass. car black plate sequence.

Damn...I just realized how bored I am to be writing this crap =)
