Subject: Another friday oh sh(-at-)t!

   Today I got a letter from my business insurance company stateing that I
know have terrorism insurance. This is a new program MANDATED and subsidized
by the federal goverment, our tax dollars at work again! At  least if my
shop is blown up in a terrorist attack all my buses inside are insured by
the feds!!
