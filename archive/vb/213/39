Look at pages 309 and 319 of the '67 parts manual online at
http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/ .  I also strongly suggest buying
the '62-'67 Bentley manual
http://www.bentleypublishers.com/product.htm?code=V267 from your favorite
Bus parts vendor.

>Is the front drum held on like an old bug with the twin crappy nuts?

Yes.  You'll need new lock plates for between the nuts, too.  I am told
that you can fit a clamping nut from a bay-window Bus onto late '64 and
up splitties, but I haven't tried it myself.  I do know that the clamp
nuts for a late Bug are too small for a split.
