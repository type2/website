same in oregon. at dmv when i moved from washington they thought i was crazy trying to get 'truck'
plates for the pick ups. unless i wanted to pay thousands of dollars.  so i quickly agreed to the
$30/2year cost of passenger plates.
then i got the riviera and now i am a 'motor home' and pay an additional $114/2years based on
length in addition to my 30 dollars. so i guess all the good prices i got for 5 years eventually
catch up!
