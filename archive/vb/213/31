In the case where nothing seems to work, and you decide to sacrifice the
old drum, one way to get it to break loose is to carve through the drum
with an abrasive wheel on an angle grinder.  Make your cut from the
outside of the drum inward as close to the hub as you dare.  Then carve a
long tapered slot into which you can insert a large cold chisel and wedge
the slot wider.  With luck, you can crack the remaining material
near the splines or at least stretch it enough to get things off.  Liberal
application of the blue wrench may make this go faster.

After you do this once, you discover why anti-sieze grease was invented.
