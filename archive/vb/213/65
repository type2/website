Subject: RE: [VB] California "Pink" slips

All of my buses and even my F 250 diesel tow vehicle have passenger car
plates here in az, including my DD panel, DC, 15 window, 63 Westy, SC. My
cargo van (here in 2 weeks) and my 61 fire truck might be a different story,
I'll find out when I go to MVD

I believe in 1965 CA required a special permit for campers, or at least
certification for campers converted in CA.  My 65 Sundial had a "motorhome"
or some sort of tag on the pass. dogleg, right by the Sundial tag.  The only
pre-64 buses I've seen with those tags, were converted to campers after
1965.  My 63 does not have one, or evidence of one being there.

Most states I've lived in (CA,NV,TX,MS,LA) trucks were cheaper to register
than passenger cars.  They were not necessarily true "commercial" vehicles,
but did have "truck" plates on them.  

I believe CA just considers them 'commercial' in the sense of their purpose,
rather than a 'for hire' definition.

Isn't there a guy in thesamba.com selling repops of the CA motorhome tags?

Another thing....I've only seen CA based camper conversions with those
tags....no Westys that I can remember...so it must of been a manufacturing
certification of some sort.
