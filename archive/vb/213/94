Subject: Re: What Happened? & Baltimore Trip

I was one of the bidders and the guy said it got crashed while being towed to
a shop to get it running. Said he would email when he found out what was
wrong. Greg, I kind of thought we would see it in Nor Cal in a few months
(HaHa). Wish it was coming to me in Havasu. Will just have to wait and see. It
will turn up somewhere.

Made it back from Baltimore Wed afternoon. I sure learned a new respect for
you eastern bus drivers. Landed at BWI sat afternoon to 4 inches of snow and
more falling. Spent Sat night at my daughters boyfriends parents house in
Abingdon Md. Woke up at 6:30 and about 8 " of snow had come down and a ton
more was falling. Got to I-70 and then to I-81 after about 6 hours. I have
never seem so much snow, at times you could not even see the freeway. We were
driving my daughters Honda Civic and it ran great. Saw all kinds of BMW's and
Mercedes stuck in the snow banks, semis and cop cars also. Think we were the
last car through Virginia, got to Bristol and I-40 about 7PM Sun night. with
white knuckles. I'm a SoCal and Az. raised guy and this was only the second
time driving in snow and the first in a blizzard. Had a great drive the rest
of the way with only alittle rain in Albuquerque on Tues afternoon. We
averaged almost 34 MPG at 75 MPH once we got out of the snow and ice. You guys
can have the snow, I'll take the 120 degree days in Havasu. Only saw 1 bus on
whole trip back to Az. and it was a bubble being towed behind a pickup in
Texas.
