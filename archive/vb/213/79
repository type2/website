Subject: re:a phriday question

not sure why this is a friday question and not just a "water tank question"

I have an ez-camper, and the water tank in it is some type of plastic. It
developed a crack around the base/where the drain pipe threads in. I think i
had tightened the drain plug too much, causing the pipe to split the tank.

anyway i fixed mine with a heat gun, & just melted it.
