Doug -

I have one thing to try...It is the ONLY thing I have ever needed to unstick
ANYTHING..!   P.B. Blaster.  Sold at Auto Parts stores, Like Discount Auto,
Mebbe Pep Boys.  Spray a bit in the offending area, give it a few taps, and
walk away for a bit.  It may take a few goes using this procedure but it
will work.  Let me know your results... - K
