The way the byzantine CA regs work, a "housecar" is a passenger vehicle.
The definition of "housecar: varies, but generally a camper interior that
cannot be removed easily qualifies.  You can get a passenger licence for a
pickup if it has a permanently mounted camper, but if you take the camper
off you have to reregister it as a commercial vehicle (with higher fees)
