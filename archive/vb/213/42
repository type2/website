Hi Volks,
There should be a local rental place for equipment near you.  Make sure the 
puller is for either all five lug bolts (The ones for only three lugbolts 
usually rip out the female thread out of the drum on the third lug bolt) or 
the type that grabs the drum itself with at least three arms.  We rented a 
puller from one of our two rental place for $7.00 for the day and it pulled 
an unmovable drum that had been run for over 500 miles with no sign of 
loosening with the axle nut backed off a turn and cotter pinned.
