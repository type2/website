There is truly nothing like the high of success over a worthy opponent.

You guys have beat this drum long enough!
Its time for heat.
A small propane torch will likely make enough heat without turning the
drum hub cherry red.
Heat it a few times then go back to the hammer routine, you can do the
hammer on either hot or cold.
