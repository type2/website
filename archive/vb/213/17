Subject: Re: [VB] Stuck drum

I have a puller on it right now, and it hasn't budged. 
--------------------- Clip ------------------------
Stupid procedure, I loosten the nut, put the key back in with the nut
backed off 1/4" and bounce over and off a few curbs.
I also run hard down rough pot hole streets ............ never failed to
loosten the drum.
There is of course the necessity to back the brake shooes off and the
emergency brake if it is tight.
