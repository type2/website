Be careful about these cheap airfares. United Airlines is in bankruptcy 
chapter 11 right now. It is very possible they may declare chapter 7 before 
to terribly long. That means liquidation and bye-bye travel as well as 
so-long moolah. If you do take the risk be sure to purchase the tickets using 
a credit card. It is your only chance of getting a refund. If you pay with a 
debit card you lose any and all instantly. 

I don't mean to preach but as an airline employee myself I have seen a lot 
over the years so be careful.
