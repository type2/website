Subject: Drunk Driver Convicted

Some of you may remember a few years ago in Illinois, a family returning
from Great America in their splitty bus was hit by a drunk driver. Three
kids, the Mother and the family dog were all killed, only the Father
survived although he was seriously injured.
I heard on the news yesterday that the driver who caused the accident has
finally been convicted and will probably be sentenced to 14 years in prison.
I believe that the Arizona Bus Club held a fundraiser for this family. I'm
sorry that I've misplaced the original newspaper article and can't recall
the names of the family. They were from Crystal Lake Illinois.
I think a lot of us who've been on the list awhile remember this incident.
