Subject: Parts wanted for pattern purposes on fabbing

OK here's the deal , i need several particular parts in great shape,
complete and rust free, not mangled or bent. I don't have to have NOS. I
want good stuff to use for patterns. These will not be resold, they are for
use to produce as close to orginal looking parts as i possibley can. At this
point i'm using crusty parts form donor buses and parts off buses we have
restored, some are made off of the crappy repop's on the market. This is the
short way to look at it i can't make chicken soup form chicken sh**. Here's
the main parts i need
1. Drivers side b-pillar, as tall as possible (12 -15 inches would be great)
2. Passengers side b-pillar assembly ( inner and outter, past lower hinge
would be excellent)
3.Drivers side wall post (about 12 inches tall) I make these now but i think
i could do a better job with a better pattern post.
4 I need skylight sections full ,particurly a front one and one of the rear
area. i would love to have a complete side section from front to rear
windows with all the window frames intact, and to the gutter rail inner
structure not necessary but would be nice.
We can deal on parts or cash your call. I'm also going to post this plea to
sambe as well. And please folks be reasonable in your pricing , i don't
gouge on my parts prices please show me the same respect.
