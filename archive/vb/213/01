Another point, if you have your heater box to case shrouds installed correctly, only a small amount
of water would be able to reach the heads. Them Germans is pretty smartlee!

Well, this is more properly thermostatics...

I think your figure for CHT is a bit high.

Still, what causes cracking is when one part of a brittle material is
subjected to thermal expansion at a different rate than another part.  If
there is sufficient flexibility built in, there won't be a problem

The crankcase doesn't run anywhere near as hot, and any water splashed on
it will not cool it too much.  Now, if you immerse it in water it might be
different.

The heads can't really be immersed, and the tin and strong downward air
flow really keeps splashed water away.
