Subject: [VB] Bad Camberg air fares

Clara & I have gotten our tickets using my united miles, great.
I am trying to use up my United miles as quickly as possible, but the company 
I work for has an agreement with United and they get a 30% discount so I have 
to fly United inside the US unless I can really show an advantage for someone 
else.
But you all should know that the really cheap fares still have airport fees & 
taxes.
Mine from Brussels are $125 and Clara's returning from London are $250 so be 
aware that there are costs above the airline charges that can be significant!
