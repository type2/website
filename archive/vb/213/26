Subject: Vaccum Hose Attachment

I have a dual vaccum distributor hooked up to a 34 pict 3 carb.  I attached a hose from the left side of the carb to the domed side of the vaccum can and a hose from the front of the carb to the back of the vaccum can (flat side facing shroud).

Is this correct or backward?


Enjoy your day!
