Subject: 67 front brakes..

  Ok my bus was tooling right along for its first 300 miles after 
hibernation with all (well, mostly all) well. I noticed a gradual pull in 
the front getting worse to the left on brakes, figured maybe id get lucky 
and it would be adjustment, no such luck. I look down and see the famous wet 
wheel syndrome. I have ordered the (4) wheel cylinders and new shoes. I have 
never done bus front brakes, id like to see an exploded or picture before i 
break into mine if anyones got one. If not id REALLY like to know what tools 
i should have. Im going to buy a flare wrench set (the cheapie set i found 
was 10-15mm, will this suffice?). I read the archive and someone mentioned 
the line between the cylinders was problematic, is there a good chance of 
this breaking and me needing that too? Is the front drum held on like an old 
bug with the twin crappy nuts? If so what size are these so i can grind a 
wrench down in advance. Thanks

equally loose, next project... bah..
