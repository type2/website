Subject: Old Blaupunkt radio help needed

Hey knowledgeable ones....

I just received (from Germany) a 12-volt Blaupunkt
Franfurt model radio for my 67 deluxe. I thought it
was the bigger "snap in" style for my big dash hole,
but it looks like it might fit a 66 or earlier.

The faceplate is really nice and the radio is tested
working, it's "period" so I want to use it. Has anyone
got tips on mounting an earlier radio in a 67 or later
bus? There are threaded holes in the side of the body
for mounting, but what could I mount it to? (I'm
looking for the least amount of drilling/hacking
possible.

Also, there is only the antenna wire and a yellow wire
comeing out the back, but several jacks and a hole for
a multi-prong plug. Anyone know of an expert on these
old radios where I can get the parts to hook it up
right and not fry it?   (You know, I'm looking for the
radio version of Gabriel the key guy.).
