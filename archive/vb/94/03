OK, folks.  This doesn't happen w/ a bus, but I bought a ghia last weeken=
d and wasn't getting any fuel. After applying suction and blowing air thr=
ough the line, I took the fuel tank out to discover crud backed up to at =
least the first 90degree bend in the line.  I was able to get most of it =
out with a bit and the line is somewhat clear now.  My question is what c=
an I use to clear out the rest of the line, or should I just replace it a=
long with the tank(haven't found a source for a fuel line yet)?  Umm, bus=
 content....  sold my 1600 and am building the type IV now, hope to be re=
ady by OCTO.  Will be posting curtain measurements on the sundial site so=
on.  And I really really really really miss California. :(  I did happen =
to locate the local VW club http://www.oldfortvwclub.com/ and attended a =
meeting, feels odd asking about other's VW to get a reply of "I have a 99=
 out in the parking lot".
