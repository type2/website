Subject: The definition of "running"????

I was just looking through the classifieds on Everetts site, as I do everyday, looking for my next project.  There's an ad for a 56 Kombi with the following quote, taken verbatim from the listing >>"The bus has a running 36 horse motor in it. It does not run right now...<<"  WTF??  Oh well, in the seller's defense, the bus was listed for VERY cheap and was probably worth the money whether it was running or running!!! ;^)
