Speaking of parts stashes..
 I'm helping my father clean out what remains of his
VW repair shop.  He has been out of the buisness for
about 15 years or so, but he's got some stuff left.
Most of it is beetle parts, but there is a few
interesting tidbits I've come across.
 He's got a set of old VW Dealer repair maunuals, the
factory type in the blue binders.  They are all in
fair condition, but they have been used.  Some are 2
volume sets, and they cover "1200" , "1500" ,
"Passenger Cars" and of course "Transporter", ranging
in years from 1959-1965. Anyone know how rare these
are and what they might be worth? And yes, some will
be for sale.
  There are some trim parts, lights&lenses, lots of
old carbs, distributors and the like.  I also have a
complete 1200 for sale, it was supposed to be a
low-milage rebuild, but I've never tried to run it.
Although it looks very clean and rolls over well, it
would be safe to assume that it would need to be
torndown. Make offer???
  I will be chipping away at this stuff over the next
few weeks, so feel free to e-mail if there is anything
in particular you are looking for.  There's lots of
used engine parts, especially the 1200-1500 stuff, and
the price will be right.

Thanks
Matt
