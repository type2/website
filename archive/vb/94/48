Are you a member of NEATO? If you are, I see no reason
why you couldn't get that chapter back on the road.
Starting a chapter is easy, NEATO has some guidelines
set for it, and then all you need is enthusiasm! I
will forward your mail for you to see if you can get
some help. As for it being active in the past, it has
been along time. I used to talk to Dennis on the
phone, and met Andy at Dave's show in Georgia or maybe
it was at Buses on the Blue Ridge, but they must of
gotten out of buses or something. NEATO just removed
there listing along with several others from the list
of chapters.
