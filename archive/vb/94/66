Subject: revisiting carbs

Group,
awhile back I started a whirlwind discussion on the possible use of the
34PICT carb in a dual carb configuration. My interest derived from the
terrible lack of aftermarket cabs for VW use. Among the jeers and cheers,
some people asked why, and some asked how.

I have made adapter plates for 34 ICT baby dells manifolds which are
available from several parts houses for $65 and some makshift center driven
linkage. I will let you know how that goes on my test engine, a
semi-standard 1641cc DP engine. The only changes have been better breathing
041 heads and a Bosch .050 distributor. Pics coming soon. 

My second line of enquiry was a center mount carb. To date we have Dells and
Webers for sale, all the other legacy carbs used years ago are not in
production now. With the purchase of a Holly/Weber progressive center
section for $55 I will start to rumage through the wrecking yards and see
what I can find. One note of interest if you can still find one, the Ford
Pinto and Chevy Vega four cylinders originally came out with the progressive
carb. The stick 71 Pinto had a 28/36 DCV and the auto had a 32/36. I really
want to find a DCV and see if that conquers the low end drop out squishyness
that you get with the 32/36. Again, I'll let you know. Up untill 93 when
fuel injection became nearly standard across the board for all car
manufacturers, there was a slew of 4-banger carbs out there. Something has
to be able to fit and clear the generator and provide a little more power. 

Do I seem to have too much time on my hands? Someone has got to do it!
