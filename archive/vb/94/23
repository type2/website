Subject: So-Cal to Corona de Tucson

Hey guys,

The family and I are heading to Corona de Tucson this weekend.  We are planning to leave late Friday night, since I have to work.

Anyone from So-Cal heading out that ways and want to caravan?  We live in Temecula and are planning to take the I-10.

Later,
