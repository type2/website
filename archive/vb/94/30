I'd say the main drawback is that your spare tire is not the same as what's 
under all corners of the truck.   Though the 65 came with 14s all around, 
maybe a PO wanted a little more road speed.  
FWIW my 61 has the big stub/nut RGBs with 15"s on the back.    Actually it 
has 14"s on the front right now (till I get the 15" rims powder coated and 
new tires), which makes the speedo read higher than it really goes, and the 
bus has that tilted nose dive look.
