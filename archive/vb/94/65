I started a 59 panel project last winter and decided to try all of the parts 
suppliers on the market to see how everyone matched up.  Now a couple of 
companies far exceeded my expectations and a couple others left me high and 
dry when they sold bogus parts, that were broken during PROFESSIONAL 
installation, and would not take the good parts back after such notice 
without a restocking fee and adjustment on the bum parts.  Now after the 
phone call I was peaved and said I would bash the company in a public way.  
Like a banner on my bus on the way to all major VW events here in Europe, but 
then I thought, I just wont give them any more of my money and that I would 
be stooping to their level by doing such a unkewl thing.  If anyone wants my 
top ten of companies to deal with e-mail me privately and I will share them 
just not in a PUBLIC froum.
