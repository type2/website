Subject: Re: [VB] front beam swapping

I just put a '64 beam in my '59 panel.

It wasn't hard at all, just make sure before you bolt in the new one, you
have it pretensioned at the bottom (I used a come along for this) so when
you hit the brakes for the first time it doesn't shift forward.  I would
recommend if you need to do a center pin kit fix, do it while the beam is
out, it makes it MUCH easier. The hardest part was getting the front shift
coupling off, I ended up cutting mine off (one slice on each side), and
getting a new one from Ronnie at oldvolks.com

Later
Charles

P.S. I don't know for sure, but I bet it's the same height.  I ended up
lowering mine with drop spindles, and cut and turned the beam.
