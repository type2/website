Hi Steve,
What really matters is the outer diameter of the sets of front and rear tires 
and how close they are to the stock diameter.  Not just the diameter of the 
rims.  We once upon a time ran 25" on the front and 27" diameter tires on the 
rear of our 1960 panel camper conversion for many years instead of the stock 
27" outer diameter tire with no problems other than running too low of wieght 
rated front tires which made for sloppy steering in side winds and when semis 
passed.  If the tire you have are of at least 1525 Lbs. wieght rating you 
could wait till later to buy a set of 14" rims and get tires that have about 
the stock outer diameter.  Otherwise get the right rims and a set of properly 
weight rated tires!  Just remember if you have to use a differant outer 
diameter spare tire to the rear set or all the running tires you do not want 
to run the spare for very long on the rear axle or risk ruining the 
differential!
