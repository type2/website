Subject: RE: Seatbelts especially the guy with the self tapping screws...

Don't use self tapping screws to mount seat belts!! Even large washers
mounted in most places on our sheet metal busses can pull out in a real
accident. I agree with Rick you need very strong new hardware and large
steal backing plates are a plus as well. The washers that come with most
seat belt install kits are about 3 times as big and 3 times as thick as
standard washers. I would still go with the metal plates. Or maybe the
metal plates and big washers.
