Hello list,
First of all, it's kinda scary to hear about all of the busses and bugs =
that are being stolen.  A couple of weeks ago, a guy I know had his 56 =
oval stolen at a Cruise Night at Fuddrucker's, here in Pasadena where I =
live.  It was parked in the lot right next to the cars on display, and =
he was never more than 50 yards away from his car.  Sad thing is, he had =
just bought a bunch of NOS stuff at Pomona 2 weeks before, and all of =
his tools were in the car too.  It's his daily driver, so he's walking =
now.

Makes me look over my shoulder every time I pull into my driveway, for =
fear that someone has followed me home.  I have a recently restored 67 =
Sundial, along with a restored 66 sedan, and am currently working on a =
63 ragtop that is my son's.

At any rate, I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with those =
security devices that, when you push down on the brake pedal, it locks =
up your brakes so that your vehicle won't move?  I have a friend who =
bought one for the 65 Standard that he is restoring, but since it isn't =
done yet, he hasn't installed or used it.  He said that there are two =
different models of this security device on the market.  The one he =
bought costs about $130.

Any comments or suggestions about these types of devices would be =
appreciated.

The cowards that perpetrated the September 11th tragedies would have won =
if we had stopped traveling, and changed our lifestyles.  By the same =
token, the car thieves have won if any of us decide it's easier/better =
to not own a split bus because we're paranoid that it will get stolen.  =
I WILL NOT cave in to them.

TIA,=20
