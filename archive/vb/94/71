Subject: RE: [VB] front beam swapping

Jesus,

I swapped a late 64-67' beam into my 63' panel without incident. Everything
lined up, with no affect on ride.  I'll mention I put drop spindles on.  I
was interested in the swap for cheaper brakes.  It all went well. - Kevin

anybody know, or have a guess, if front beams can easily be swapped out
between splitties? i know that some ppl do the 68-69 beam swap, but i'm
looking at 64-67 into my 59 bus. if so, is ride height affected, as in the
bay window beam conversion?
