if the writer is the guy that i think it is (and the writing style indicates as much), he is totally out of the vw scene; he drives a h*nda crx now.  he's turned to the dark, riced out world.  <grin>  also to my knowledge he has never owned a bus to drive it.  now before this sounds like bashing to anyone, robert is my buddy.  he is very knowledgeable about vws (though he admits that he's forgetting stuff) and now very knowledgeable about crxs.  what a funny small world we live in.
