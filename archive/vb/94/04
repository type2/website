Subject: RE: New Video with a 21 window in it!

Everyone should see this video it takes place in 1974 all the out fits and
the scenery is from that era. All they do is play music (hince the music
video)and drive around in the deluxe. I can't say any more it will spoil it
for everyone. :-)

Enjoy!!

1965 Deluxe 21
1967 Deluxe 13
