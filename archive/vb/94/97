Subject: Re: [VB] My bus, my reply

I can appreciate both points of view and they really aren't that far apart!
I helped Dan cut the roof off the bus that ended up on John's DD Panel
Barndoor ?? window sunroof.  That bus was a done deal.  I posted the
pictures a couple of years ago but the bus had sat in a field under a tree
for who knows how long and the canvas had disintegrated long ago so all the
seasons had deposited in there for years!!  The bulkhead was rusted to foil
a good 6 inches above the floor!  When we cut the roof off the bus just
folded to the ground.  There were a few other trinkets like latches and such
but the bus itself was just gone.  From what I have heard the Barndoor SC
was pretty bad also!  Don't know about the panel!  My point here is that
John took a few busses that were bad or gone and made a $20-$30K bus that I
do appreciate.  Personally I like stock and I think most of you here do also
but when someone has the talent and creativity to do what John did deserves
kudos. Hopefully Street Rodders won't be the only ones that can be looked up
to for doing custom!  I loved the stuff that KCW did with that bus and was
very thought provoking.  But I also have to wonder about the depreciation of
a wild custom.  Look at the Batman car market!!   And like John said it is a
money losing proposition for him but it is also his ride.  And probably
somewhat of a write-off? for his business.  If I had $20K sitting here we
would be having drinks right now toasting the new owner of your bus!  But I
would drive it!  At least on cloudless sunny Sundays!
