I was checking out the North American web site and it brought me here.(page 
address is below)  If I'm not mistaking VW needs to make a few changes of 
it's own, unless they own the chain of auto parts stores that go by the name 
of AUTOZONE.  You decide, we have any attorneys in this group???  It looks 
like the real link to auto zone but it's not........Rick
