At the risk of starting this thing up again I still love that ride. If I
had 30k sittin around I woud be all over that thing. I don't really
blame him for raising the price. It has been up for sale at a bunch of
different stages. It seems like each time it came back up for sale it
had alot more done to it. This last price hike seems to be directly
related to the exposure in Hot VW's. It was at $25k and now it is at
$30k. I am not sure I agree with hiking the price because it was in the
magazine but I also understand the economics of the situation. He has a
business and the bus just got a huge amount of exposure as well as a Hot
VW's stamp of approval (for what that's worth) it makes sense that he
can get more for it. I say good work KCW! Keep them coming. Just make
sure the parts are coming from heaps. With his skills if any of the
busses he used were restorable I am sure he would have done that. Can
you imagine how much he could have made with a restored barndoor,
restored 23 window, and a restored panel all done to that quality of
finish.
good luck,
