Ever thought of going to the military surplus store and getting some crash
webbing, or maybe a lot of duct tape, or whatever. Heck, what do I know, I
drive a Single Cab !

 Have you done a visual to verify no mounts exist? My '67 Westy already had
 the nut plates from the factory. Just removed the plastic plugs and
 installed bay seatbelts.
 Sorry if you already said, just got back on the list :)

I think it was in 66 that VW had seat belt mounts installed from factory in 
the buses front and rear.   My 65 has them factory in front, none in rear.  
My 61 came with no seat belt mounts.  Not sure when they started giving them

seat belt mounts stock in the front.
