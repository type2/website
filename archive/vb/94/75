Robert,

Can't wait.   I've got a '61 So 23 (mango,sgg) and have downloaded a bunch of the pics of yours from Thom's site for reference.  And there is nothing plain ol' about your resto.  Your bus is the vision I see in my head when I look at mine.  Someday....

Looking forward to it.

I thought I would give everyone who is interested a heads up to be on the lookout for it.
