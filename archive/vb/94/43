 Didn't 15" wheels come standard on some years? If so, could you use a speedo
 from that year bus and have 15 inchers all around and still have the speedo
 show the right MPH's?

the speedo cable reads off the left front wheel, which on my 61 has a 185 /70 
R14 tire, smaller than the stock tire size which the speedo is set for- or 
was over 40 years ago.   The bus has the original speedo.   I guess if he has 
a speedo for the 14" on the front and size tire that matches stock size it'll 
read right.  But  mine doesn't.   The rears are 205 75 15.   It wasn't 
planned- honest,  just ended up that way.   But it gets me daily from point A 
to point B over C which is mostly paved.  Eventually I want nice shiny 
powdercoated matches stock 15" rims with hubcap clips and LT reinforced 
sidewall tires, but it's a driver, and there is no rush.
