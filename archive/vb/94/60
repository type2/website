Better put some HUGE washers, or better yet a large heavy piece of metal on
the back side of where ever you are bolting, and a LARGE number 8 grade
bolt, or those shoulder harnesses and belts are worthless.

In an accident, even a seat belt itself if it is old will rip and mounts
that are rusty, or poorly mounted will tear out in seconds.

You can't believe the forces present in an accident and being thrown around
in or from the vehicle is the fastest way to get seriously injured.  You and
your kids are MUCH safer if you stay secured to your seat.
