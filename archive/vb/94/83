you can put a 64-67 beam in a 63/earlier bus with no problems.   The only 
practical difference is that the steering damper attached both end to the 
beam on the later beam, one end to the beam and one to the bus on the earlier 
style.   

Careful of the shift linkage when swapping! You'll have to take it apart at 
the forward coupler.
