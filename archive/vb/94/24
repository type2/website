you got my cell in case you have any problems? Being your traveling with the
new baby I want to make sure all bases are covered. I'll also be leaving
Havasu Friday (I have to drive the Ford) with trailer being I have a lot of
stuff to pick up in that area.

Hey guys,

The family and I are heading to Corona de Tucson this weekend.  We are
planning to leave late Friday night, since I have to work.

Anyone from So-Cal heading out that ways and want to caravan?  We live in
Temecula and are planning to take the I-10.

Later,
Beto
