I knew I should have put bags under it.<snip>

do the next best thing: after the issue comes out, put your bus up for sale for 30k!  <grin>

a little more seriously, even though you didn't bag your bus, you did spend a great deal of time getting that plaid fabric for the interior right... along with everything else.  when i think of your bus and after shaking my head about how beautiful it is, i think about the plaid fabric.
