Subject: Ebay?

Hey, my name is Nate. Im 18 and I really am into VW buses. I found a great 
bus on ebay and the guy says it runs perfectly. How sure can I be that he is 
relyable? It looks too good to be true but I have to drive to Virginia to get 
it (Im in PA) What if I get it home and its all messed up? I really want it 
but Im not sure.... give me your imput.
Nate
