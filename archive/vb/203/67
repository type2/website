Sounds good. My face is fine. :)

Could, but I'd rather know it's calibrated....they're a bit nitpicky about
being 2mph over the speedlimit once I get near work.

Done that.  Unscrewed it while I was driving (well, in stop-n-not-much-go
traffic) and make sure it was still spinning as expected.  Needle was
stuck at 40mph while I had the cable in my hand...though thursday and
friday it seemed to be back to normal (no odo though)


thanks.
