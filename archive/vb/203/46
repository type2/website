Hi Tom,
You first need to figure out where the gear oil and if it is gear oil is 
leaking out.  Gear oil has a sulfur smell, very unlike the engine oil.  
Finding the origin of the leak is best done by crawling under the bus with 
flashlight in hand and look above the puddle on the ground.  As to wether 
something is broke or not depends on many factors which can be narrowed down 
by knowing exactly where the leak is coming from.
