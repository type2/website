Hi Don,
Yes it will and very likely due to the missing bolt head warp the clutch 
pressure plate.  Take the bolts out evenly as possiblre and just replace 
them.

Center punching and/or a very small chisel the broken bolt remains in a 
clockwise motion might work.  If not try drilling it out.  Especially if you 
can get some left handed drill bits and have a reversable drill motor.

  I had already broken my 3/4 ratchet, and bent an angle iron breaker bar

Get to your local Proto tool dealer and get the 3/4 L-shaped breaker bar.  
Cost is a bit more than a Craftsman 3/4 breaker bar, but a heck of alot 
stronger!  We have bent and broken numerous Craftsman 3/4" breaker bar and so 
far have not been able to bend the Proto tool even after using an eight+ foot 
breaker bar to force a rusted on axle nut off!

Once you have the gland bolt off, do replace it with a new one since it 
obviously has been over torqued.  When you do make sure to grease the needle 
bearing inside it or have nasty shifting problems soon after (BTDT!) and 
EVERY time you reinstall the engine put a dab of new grease on the sides of 
the tip of the tranny inputshaft to automaticly regrease these needle 
bearings.
