Craig-
We want to see what's left of the crankshaft
and the cam gear. The bearings are junk,and
add the cost of a new oil cooler to the parts list.
Casting sand residue in the oil galleys would 
have been removed during the machining phase
before the galley plugs were installed.
While it would be the builder's responsibility to clean
all new parts, it is impossible to verify the oil  galleys 
without removing the plugs, as the ends of the galleys 
are blind traps for any residue that enters them.
I have gotten soaked to the bone with the pressure
washer while cleaning cases, and still found residue
when the plugs were removed for full-flow modification,
so now I do the whole case, and verify all galleys.
You would like to assume this is not necessary with a 
new case, but with all the time you spent on this one, 
where else would so much residue be hiding?!
This is a first generation new aluminum case.
You missed an excellent opportunity to have it
replaced before assembly, since many issues were 
resolved with succeeding generations , as you are aware.
It just remains to see the internal damage and 
determine the source of the malfunction(s).
7.0:1 compression ratio is a good number.
