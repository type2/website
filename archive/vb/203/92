I won one of his auctions but fortunately he never completed the transaction. I have been in contact with the other buyer and he told me they are brazillian and are complete garbage. The seller appears to be a "major" supplier of VW parts as well, though they had some setbacks within the last few years. Here is the link:

I'll 2nd that. A friend of mine called me when he saw "they" (RMMW) had 
NOS mud flaps listed in their catalog for $50 a set. Needless to say he 
was a bit miffed when they showed up and clearly said "Hecho in Brazil", 
or something to that effect, definitely *not* German!
