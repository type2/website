"we already have one... its called biodiesel. i just dont understand why our
government doesnt put more money into development. the mpg are huge, it
could bring agriculture back to our farms and reduce emissions greatly!

How to make biodiesel: Fill up the John Deere with diesel.  Go out and plow
the field and plant something.  After a while, fill up the JD again and go
spray fertilizer and pesticides (both petrochemicals) on it. Finally, fill
up the JD again and cut the stuff, dump it into a diesel truck, and haul it
to the processing plant.  There is some debate as to whether you would be
better off just putting the diesel in your car in the first place - it is
maybe not clear that biodiesel gives you more
energy than it costs to make it."

I tried to resist this topic...as it has slowly taken a roller coaster ride
away from buses(although it is very interesting reading.

What you are referring to here is often called embodied energy(I think, it
has been a while). It is often used to compare the environmental impact of a
given material(as an architect we often look at this when specifiying
materials to use in building). For example which has more embodied
energy-concrete or wood....
Anyway, yes you need to fill the John Deere with some type of fuel, and
possibly use fertilizer and pesticides, and haul it to the processing plant
etc. But how much energy is used in importing oil from abroad? etc. I am
sure that someone has figured out the emodied energy I will do some
searchign on the net...and let you know if I find anything...(I just found
out Greenpeace is giving away free biodiesel in the UK, made from rapeseed
oil)
