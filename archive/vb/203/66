Subject: Re: [VB] Exper. w/ speedometer repair shops?

I've had work done by north Hollywood Speedp and Palo Alto Speedo.   I think 
they are afflicated.  Good work.  Nice shiny cad plated screws etc.   The 
speedo in my 52 was crappy looking so I got one that had a beautiful face but 
didn't work at a swap, and got it rebuildt.  Oh ya, they don't redo the face 
I think.  

Does cost though.  Unless your speedo is rare, you might want to get one at a 
swap. 

hm, I'd double check the cable too.   undo screw to cable under speedo, 
remove left front wheel cap, and spin end of cable and see if the other end 
spins.   Check to see if cap hole is round.  it should be square.   hm, the 
cable should have poked out of the cap too, and be held with a circlip or 
cotter pin.

<< Hey folks.
 
 Has anyone had any experience with any of these speedometer repair shops?
 The odo on the '66 stopped working last monday (or sometime between the
 fillup prior and monday...).  I've been inside enough of'm to know I'd
 rather not do it myself this time.
 
 I've talked to three shops, all in cali.
