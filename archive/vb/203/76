Subject: pre 62 felt channel

hi all

ive search through the archive about a new front windows felt channel and
all ive found is that we can purchase one at jc whitney.

Is this the best way to restore the front windows channel ?

where else is there felt kit for a 60 bus?

Ive seen COMPLETE DELUXE DOOR SEAL KIT for busses 50-67 on California
import, channel seems included, and there is a brazil and USA version... is
the USA version worth the extra money?  at least you get all the other
rubbers...

thx for any input
