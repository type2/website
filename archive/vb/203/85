 If so, it seems I now need to swap flywheels also, or

I break one of the clutch cover mounting bolts almost everytime I install
a new clutch cover.
Buy a new set of bolts and use LOCK washers, not wavy washers under the
heads.
Mine torque at 16 PSI and they seem to break and stay loose in the
flywheel so you might not be in for any drilling ............. more just
picking with a pointed chisel / punch it get it moving.
