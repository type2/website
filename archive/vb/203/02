Subject: Help calibrating Torque wrench

Hey,
about a year ago someone had posted a nifty backyard way of calibrating your
clicker torque wrench by chucking it up in a vice and hanging a known amount
of weight off of the handle. At the time I thought that it was a nice thing to
know, but I had a guy that did all my tool calibration. Now he is gone and I
can't find that info anymore. Someone on the list still have it? It costs
about as much to take in your tools to the existing shops as it does to go buy
another one!

Thanks
