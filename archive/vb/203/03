However, decades after the nukes were placed online,
no one, anywhere has a viable solution for the disposal
of the spent reactor products. It just keeps getting
larger, with no solution in sight. The military uses
as much as possible as munitions (radioactive uranium)
don't believe the hype, it still radiates and affects
people shooting it and living in it afterwards for the
dust gets into lungs and causes cancer.

There is NO place on earth safe enough for 50000 years
to store it, regardless of efforts otherwise. The earth
moves too much over that time span.

If the cost of engineering efforts for disposal had
ever been factored into nuke plants, they never would
have been built. They conveniently left it for those
in the future to solve, and we have no solution in sight.

Solar direct, solar breakdown to H2 and biomass for fuel,
are the best bets for the near future, barring some
breakthrough.

Regardless of how much oil we extract, it will continue
to diminish in availability. 30 years from now, I expect
oil to be too precious as a raw stock for manufacturing
to be burned away.

Busses are an ideal vehicle, light roomy, efficient.
We just need an updated powerplant, everything else
is already there.

The best solution is to build as many nukes as required to choke the arabs
into submission. The French did it. I believe I read that they get 70% of
their electric power from nukes.
