Subject: Re: [VB] Ebay? (Buying a bus.)

After giving your plight some thought ............... I'd suggest that
you contact the A.I.R.S in the area that your proposed purchase is
located and see if you can get someone to go over and evaluate the bus.
It is probably the best way to handle the inspection.
In addition I'd ship the bus home and stay off the highway in it until
you're confident about the mechanical condition.
I restore and sell 80-83 Westfalia and even some early Air Cooled VWs and
my primary concern is safety then mechanical dependability. In the five
or so that I've sold they all made it home to destinations 1,000 or 2,000
miles away but the buyers were all old hands at keeping VWs alive and
were well aware of the vehicles limitations.
