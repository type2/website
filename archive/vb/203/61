Subject: New Mirrors...

I just got my new mirrors for the 60 Double Cab. I had a set of Izzy's
and one side fell off because the rivet inside the mirror wasn't all the
way set. I was really set on the Flat Four mirrors but Ronnie said they
have distorted glass. He set me up with a pair of these cheapy repops at
$25 a pair. They are awesome. A little more polished than Izzy's and
they have a rubber seal around the mirror part that does not look
original, but it does look nice. I would guess this will make it easy to
replace the glass. They look great and are less than I was going to
spend on one mirror. Thanks Ronnie.
