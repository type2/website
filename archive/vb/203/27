Subject: Puddle of gear oil under my bus.

Hello,

I hope everyone is having a great weekend. Thanks for the help in solving my
oil change problem. It turns out that I must not have tightened all screws
on the sump the same. Two screws were a little looser than the others. I
think I was worried about going to tight and stripping them (as I was warned
about in the idiots guide). So, I bought a new kit to do it again. Thick
paper gaskets and cooper washers, it was also suggested that I use a German
made sealant. 

On to my next oil issue. I woke up this morning to a puddle of gear oil
under my bus. I know it is gear oil because it is was recently changed and
is still clean. I had not driven my bus for about a week, until yesterday
when I drove it to the parts store for my new oil change kit. The bus was
harder to start due to the chilly weather we are having in Florida but it
seemed to drive and perform normally. I think I have a broken seal
somewhere. So my questions are, how do I tell where? Is it likely to have
done damage? Is it common for this to happen? What might of caused this? How
difficult is it going to be difficult to replace?

Thank you in advance for any help you folks maybe able to offer.

Tom May
