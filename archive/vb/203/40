It's really dicey trying to buy a car on ebay.  It can be done, but you have
to be very careful.  You might try to find someone on the list that lives
close by and have them check it out.  It's so easy to get screwed, and you're
just standing there waiting for the seller to say "hey, you're shoe's untied"

If you're asking here how to tell if it's relyable [sic] then you have a lot
more due diligence to perform before you are ready.
