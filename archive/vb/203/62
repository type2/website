Mike Miller (Vanagon list) was musing about Buses by the Bridge, a VW camping
event held this past weekend, 01/17-19/2003, in Lake Havasu City, AZ USA.

Yes! excellent show indeed. very warm and sunny days in January ala spring
break. Gentle breeze occasionally. Not even very cold at night. Very well
orchestrated and controlled event. Attendace in the numbers previously
mentioned on the Vanagon list (230 buses/vans/eurovans etc.+/-) Carshow on
blacktop of all VW types and pleasant camping for all if desired. Hotels and
commercial food was available within walking distance- Lake Havasu equidistant
in the other.

My family arrived late Saturday afternoon. For us, the quick five minute escape
and grabbing a jug of wine are LONG gone. Two children under the age of 3.25,
two dogs, every earthly possession stuffed into the '97 Eurovancamper and we
were off. No wait! we have to breast feed the son. Ok ready... No wait, poopy
diaper over here. Walk the dogs over here. etc. Many traffic tye ups and we
were there.

We met many list members of Vintagebus, Vanagon and Ev_update lists.
Susan Dolvin is alive and well, Some guy from Mesa (Roadhaus Larry) failed to
arrive/attend in the infamous $75,000. Synchro Hamshack Westy electronic
equipment test vehicle. I still suggest that he is mythical as bigfoot or
steady Boeing employment. Dont worry, we talked **** about him anyway. ;-) We
love you Larry, where ever you are. Albuqurque tribe, Utah bretheren, Karl and
Harry from Sacto and the ever faithful support of Vintage Transporters ONLY,
SVII, OCTO, AZ Bus Club, SWATO, FullMoon Bus Club and several others.
Appologies if your name was omitted.

More details could be given but enough to say that you should plan on attending
this event next year. Great escape from the salty roads and you dont miss much
football. Drums, drugs, drunks and counterfeit shirt vendors remain under
control. A snappy salute to the Lake Havasu chapter of NEATO!

Watch for photos to be uploaded to both [theSamba.com/VW] and

hope to see YOU next year. =)
