Subject: Re: [VB] Mudflaps on Ebay

I bought some of those a year or so ago off of ebay, can't tell
if it's the same seller, but they are *CRAP*!  Actually, you'd
have to clean them up a bit for them to be crap.  And it says
"made in Brasil" (but in Portuguese) right on them (which of
course, isn't shown in the picture).   They literally feel like
they're made of bias-ply tires cut down and flattened out.  I
trimmed the tops and put them on my trailer, and found they
actually have *cords* in them like a tire!  They're fine for
the trailer, but I wouldn't put them on a car.

I won one of his auctions but fortunately he never completed the transaction. I have been in contact with the other buyer and he told me they are brazillian and are complete garbage. The seller appears to be a "major" supplier of VW parts as well, though they had some setbacks within the last few years. Here is the link:
