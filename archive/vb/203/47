Subject: re:puddle of gear oil

not sure houw you can tell it is gear oil? I thought you had recently
changed your engine oil as well-so it would be clean. Transmission oil has a
smell that is VERY different/strong compared to engine oil.

As for seals that could go....where exactly is the leak, or puddle. If you
look where the axles go in to the transmission there is a "boot" on either
side, that seal between the axle and the transmission. These are likely to
crack with age & exposure to toxic things(like transmission oil). You should
be able to see these fairly easily by crawling under your bus.

as for whether or not it caused damage-that is hard to tell. I think(not
sure this is just from memory) the transmission should hold about 3 quarts
oil(total including the RGB on each wheel), how much is on the ground?

not sure what other seals could be leaking...
