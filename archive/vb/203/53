hi nate....good luck in the vw hunt.

first suggestion:get the john muir vw guide, whatever it is called-something
about being for idiots. In it he details some basic procedures to go through
before purchasing a vw. that is what I used, and it helped me out...i didn't
know anything about automobiles at all before i got my book.
