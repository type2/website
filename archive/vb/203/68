It always distresses me when people use incorrect numbers when describing
forest land in the USA. The 10% figure is attributed to the amount of old
growth forest still standing. According to figures put out from the national
forest service, there is 1,574,320 more acres of newly forested land than
there was 70 years ago. Forest management of this renewable resource is more
regulated than any other natural industry. Wood companies have become
international trying to get as much land as possible to grow more trees
because more and more land is being set off limits or given over to rural
development. In the last 25 years Weyerhaeuser has reforested 325 square miles
of Siberia and is in the process of making new deals with other countries to
grow even more forests. Only in South America do countries rape a pillage the
land with no plan to reforest. Don't think the lumber companies haven't tried
to get foot holds there too.

Very interesting chat in the lower section of the page.
Consider that it took the Europeans almost 2000+ years to deforest Europe
burning trees for heating and cooking fuel.
The Bubonic Plague slowed things a bit.
We currently have about 10% of the forest remaining in the US after a
mere 300 years.
I'm guessing that out oil reserves are somewhere in the same condition
with only about 10% remaining after only 100 years.
The original Japanese and Asian cars arriving in the US in the early 70s
were small and got good mileage.
It would interesting to see how our fuel requirements may have been
different if they had remained small.
