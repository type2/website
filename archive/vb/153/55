Subject: Checking Fluid Levels

I am new to this vintage era, how do I go about checking the fluid levels in
my transmission and umm, the differential??

I have a 66, and I believe it is called the differential, maybe the
reduction boxes?

What should the appropriate levels be?

Thanx in advance.

Respectfully,
