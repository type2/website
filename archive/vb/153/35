Hi all,
	A friend of mine, not on the list, has a 65 Dormobile for 
sale. As far as  I can tell, it has all the correct pieces, the seats 
have been reupholstered, no engine at present. The front floors need 
renewing, the rear cargo area are pretty good and the drivers side 
rocker needs replacement. If you have any interest I would be willing 
to go and check things for you, no digital camera, as it is in the 
next town to me. He is asking $750/BO. Email me offlist and I can 
check/pass your name along.
	Mike - 67 Deluxe
