Hi Jack and everyone,

Yes, there are many families that attend BNNTA, so there should be lots o=
f other kids around for your children to mingle with next weekend.  Just =
ask anyone from the DBG folks who regularly attend.  Glad to hear that yo=
u'll be joining in on the fun.  See ya soon!  The long range weather fore=
cast last night (can we really trust those?) called for partly cloudy and=
 mid 80's temps...
