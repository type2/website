Subject: "odd" length deluxe body trim piece

Hi,

I came across an odd-length deluxe body trim piece.

It appears to be the shape of a front door piece, but it is the length 
of the front door + one cargo door. It doesn't have a notch for the door 
hinge. It is about 5'2.5" long.

Thoughts?

Thanks,
Conrad
