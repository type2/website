Subject: Need a Steering Box?

Hi,

I picked up a lonely steering box on eBarf for $15. I couldn't stand to 
see it go without a bid. They said it was off a 65.

The tag on the box has the numbers:
[ 812990174 ]
[ 474801 ] [ 863 ]

Although it it is covered in dust and rust - it operates smoothly (no 
crunchy noises) and exhibits very little "wiggle". As a bonus, the box 
includes the drop arm and a torched end of a drag link.

If anyone needs it, $15 + shipping via UPS Ground.

Thanks,
Conrad
