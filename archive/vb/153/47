Subject: leaky windows

I just replaced the windshield windows and seals on my 65 last week. Today
was the first day it rained and it wasn't very hard either. Well they
leaked. The metal wasnt rusted through , no holes. I wire wheeled it with my
angle grinder and the primed and sprayed it with some rustolem. It was a
nice smooth finish.
So why is it leaking? It is a WCM seal and it did seem that it was slightly
too small for the windshield frame. Is this common? Should I buy some from
Wolfsburg west ?
Thanks,
 -Bryan
