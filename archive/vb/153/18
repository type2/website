Subject: Re: [VB] Cracked tranny fix????

if the crack is o the UNDERSIDE of the center section, replace the 
tranny. the bottom takes most  the thrust from the torque and can't 
just be patched. it will fail catastrophically at some point ie, 
crack right in half.

   is it just on the side plates? they can be replaced.
