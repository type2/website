Subject: green light stays on...

So my idiot lights haven't been working for the past 7
years since i got the bus.
&#34;Screw it&#34; I says, cuz my bus runs great.
Idiot lights are for idiots. Well, turns out, I am an
idiot, as my bus gently reminded me, by wearing the
generator brushes down to nothing, and leaving me
camping on the side of the highway late at night in
rural, VA.
So I'm trying to get them back together now.
Consultation with the wiring diagram and testing bulbs
leads me to the conclusion that the hot wire running
from the ignition switch to the idiot lights is
missing. Quickly install one, and Bingo. Well sort of.
The oil light comes on even when the key is not
turned. It goes off when i disconnect the wire from
the oil sensor, and it also goes off when the engine
starts. 

What could be causing it to stay on when the key is
out?

The generator light doesn't come on at all...Muir says
it's because the brushes aren't touching the
commutator. We'll see. Muchas Gracias,
-Russ Henry
