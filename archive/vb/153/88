Wow Steve, you caught that in time! I had my bearing welded on my spindle of
my 71 westfailure and had to cut it off. Long story short, the spindle was
too damaged and I had to replace it. The new owner got a fresh spindle and
bearing set with freshly turned drums. Great catch, drive safe!

Upon setting out for last Saturdays SVII's VW show I noticed a really
sharp pulling to the left condition upon applying the brakes.  In
addition, a knocking sound emanated from the right front.  The sound was
in time with the speed of the bus (faster at faster speeds and slowed
down upon stopping).  Brake power seemed strong, with the exception of
the extreme pulling to the left.  

Tonight I pulled apart the right front as some suggested it was a broken
spring inside the drum.  What I found was surprising.  After a giant
struggle to get the drum off (I had to literally pound the drum off of
the bearing and seal as I didn't have a puller...never ever had to do
that!) I was confronted with a perfectly healthy brake system.  The
brakes are all new, and along with the brakes I had installed new
bearings and brake hoses all around 7K ago. 

The problem is that the inside bearing seems to have been hot.  It took
a puller to get the inner bearing off of the spindle and there is
starting to be some pitting and discoloration of the race on the inner. 
The drum cavity seemed to be very full with grease and I remember
someone saying that that is not good.  I don't remember overfilling it,
but could have.

Question:  Did my bearing overheat and start to fail causing the
knocking when the brakes were applied???  How could that cause a pulling
to the left?   Are they even related?  I'm stumpped...not hard to do BTW ;-/
