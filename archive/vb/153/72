Subject: "T" Fitting PN

http://www.type2.com/library/brakes/dualmas.htm

Just as an addition to get a new "T" fitting the VW PN is: 803 611 755.  Bus
Depot and Rocky Mountain Motorworks both have this listed, granted Bus Depot
$1 cheaper.  Made in Brazil, but there is a Porsche 914 "unofficial" part
made in Germany for $22ish at Automobile Atlanta, same part though.

You can find "T" fittings in the boneyards, but I decided to splurge so the
union nuts have some fresh threads to sink their tired old teeth into.
