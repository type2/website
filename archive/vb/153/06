Subject: re:new to the list / heater flap questions

welcome to the list...and to a new addiction.(I sometimes feel as though i
am at an AA meeting)

Anyway I am not sure about adjusting or replacing, i do know that on my '65
when i close them they are really closed-no hot air at all. So it is
definitely possible. I think the heater box flaps on mine have two holes
where the wire can connect-did you try switching the hole?

good luck.
