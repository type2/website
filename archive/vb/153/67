I am in the process of adding a small interior to my 59 fire panel bus.  I 
would like to add a rear seat not necesarilly stock, to seat at least two 
people, and maybe a storage area under neath.  Kinda like a westy basic 
interior with no frills  If anyone out there has completed a panel interior 
please email some photos or links to some web sites.....
Peace
