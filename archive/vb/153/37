Hey there all,

My transmission (1965 Type II) has recently begun to drip quite a lot of gear 
oil from the boots.  I thought there was only grease in there!  I had the 
original style boots replaced about year ago with the bolt on kind, are they 
junk or OK?  The tranny was 're-sealed' about three years ago and when I 
bought it about a year and half ago I found the tranny overfilled with 90 wt. 
 I let some out and have had no other troubles since, until recently.  What's 
up with gear oil in the boots?  Are we talkin' major repairs?  

Thanks for your help,
Arthur
