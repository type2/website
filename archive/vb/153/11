Ya, and look in the articles in Hot VWs/VW Trends as well.  I was leafing 
through one the other day at the grocery store and there were a bunch of 
errors where words that sound similar were used in the wrong place.  It 
looked pretty cruddy to actually publish something like that.  Spell check 
doesn't catch words like ''their'' and ''there" used in place of "they're".  
People get ''affect'' and ''effect'' mixed up, and even "itch" and 
''scratch''.  They don't teach grammar or spelling or even definitions of 
words in English classes at public schools. They didn't at the schools I went 
to, at least.   Just a pet peeve.

And the spell checks that have grammar checks in them are pretty annoying, 
they don't like the past passive and etc etc etc.  Okay.... rant off.   Back 
to our normally programmed VW bus station....
