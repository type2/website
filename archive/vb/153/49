Subject: Full length middle seat

I am selling an extra full length middle seat $600 B/O I can deliver it
to Sacramento, or you can come by and pick it up.

It's '64-'67 That's a guess anyway, please correct me if I'm wrong. It's
has white plastic grab handles and the material is grey w/ white piping
so I would assume its out of a Kombi.

If interested p-mail me and I'll send you some pictures.

Greg
