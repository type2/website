Call the local road department and complain.  They won't help fix your
Bus but maybe they'll fix the hole.  It will also help remind them that
the holes in the road cost people real money.

I have seen JB Weld work on the transmission case of a G*o M*tro.  It's
an automatic, and somebody used a bolt that was too long when they were
attaching one of the powertrain mounts to it, poking a hole in the side.
It was patched with JB Weld and it works just fine and doesn't leak.

The key thing is to make sure the transmission case is CLEAN, but like
CLEAN, before you put the JB Weld on.  Let all the GL-4 drip out, then
use some carb cleaner or brake cleaner on the case to get rid of the
remaining oil.  Maybe sand around the crack a little with some 220
sandpaper, then carb/brake cleaner again before putting on the JB Weld.
Let it set up for a while before refilling and driving.

I agree with Steve that if the crack seems to be in a high-stress area,
it may get worse even if the crack is fixed.  Probably the best way to
tell if that is happening is to pay attention to how it feels when
driving and to inspect it to see if the crack is getting bigger.

Good luck!
