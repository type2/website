Cool, welcome!  Here are some links you should know about if you
don't already:

I also have to give you the standard safety recommendations:
* Replace all the rubber fuel lines with new German braided line.
  Use clamps on all connections.  Carry a fire extinguisher even
  after you do this.
* Adjust and bleed your brakes.  Consider replacing all the rubber
  hoses in the brake system.  Also consider upgrading to a later-model
  dual-circuit master cylinder.
* Make sure all lug nuts are torqued properly.  Make sure the big
  rear axle nuts are torqued properly and have their cotter pins.
* Grease everything.  A Bus has just a few more grease points than
  an A1 VW.

There have been a couple of versions of heat exchangers and the levers
on the side over the years.  Some levers have holes for the cables out
near the end, and some have them halfway along the lever.  Also, somebody
may have replaced the cable with a longer or shorter one at some point.

Probably the simplest thing to do is to crank the knob in the cab all
the way towards "closed" and note the position of the levers.  Then,
disconnect the cable from one side and move the lever back and forth
by hand.  You can feel when the flap is all the way closed.  If the
"flap closed" position is farther along than the cable can pull the
lever, see if any adjustment or maybe relocating the attachment point
of the cable clamp will possibly fix it.  If it will, try it, but if
not, you may need a different cable or levers.

>Question is, are the flaps inside replaceable? repairable?

Back in the day I think you could get just the flap-box part of the
heat exchanger from VW, but I don't think you can get them separately
anymore.  On all the heater boxes I've seen, the flap box has tabs
around the edges that are crimped (not welded) onto the main heater
box sheet metal, so you can bend up all the tabs and free the flap
box.  This is much easier to do with the heat exchanger out of the
Bus.

On the couple of heater boxes I've gotten into, the flap that moves
back and forth had another sheet metal disc or "plunger" on it that
actually sealed the output pipe.  There was a spring on the connection
between the flap and the disc.  Maybe this spring is weak or missing
on your heater boxes, if they are the same style.

When you put it back together, use some sealer around the edge of
the flap box where it contacts the main heater box sheet metal.
If one of the tabs is broken, you can use a small sheet metal screw
on that tab to help secure it.

Good luck!
