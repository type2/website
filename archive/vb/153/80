I saw this on RAMVA. No connection, no further info.

......................................

I'm new to the air cooled world.  I found 3 things that 
you may find interesting.  I need to know what I have 
before I figure out what's worth fixing/selling.  I 
need your expert knowledge as to the value of my find.  
 
Here are some links to pictures
http://142.165.166.229/vw/Bug1/  is a modified bug.  
With engine
 
http://142.165.166.229/vw/Bug2/ Older bug with oval 
window, BODY ONLY
 
http://142.165.166.229/vw/Van/ NO clue as what year or 
make.  You tell me.  No engine
 
If you could tell me what I found or what it may be 
worth (USD) I would be eternally grateful!
