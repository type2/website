Arthur,

There are two types of replacement boots - the seamless ones and the
'split' type, which  you (and most folks) have.

The seamless ones are installed when the entire tranny is apart, as they
can't really be installed when the axles and redux boxes are on, too.

When the seamless ones finally go, they are replaced with the split
ones, which come in varying qualities, as Clara as noted, depending upon
who made them and other factors that no one will ever understand. Go to
your parts store, or better yet, order them from Ronnie or BusDepot here
on the list. THese two sources supply quality parts for listees, and have
for a long time.

THey are usually installed with the seams facing the rear, horizontal,
because they commonly flex up and down, and rarely along the horizontal
plane of movement. They are easier to service that way, as well. Get
either some Permatex Ultra-Grey silicon gasket maker, or Permatex 3H
Aviation Sealer (I have great success with the Ultra-grey, which sets up
in ten minutes), and use it liberally in both sides of the split seam
when you're ready to join them.

Tighten the small bolts evenly and carefully, but not over tight - the
sealer will do the sealing better if they are nicely tight, but not
pinching the seam.

Make sure the seams are dry and oil-free before sealing them up.

WHen you're done, check your tranny fluid level - it should be just on the
verge of spilling out with the car level. Don't overfill, and use GL-4,
not GL-5. Sta-Lube brand has GL-4 85-90W, and comes in a nifty bottle and
matching pump (buy separately) that works great, and lasts forever if you
take care of it.

Good Luck!
