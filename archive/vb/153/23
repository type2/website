Subject: Need info on Side-Loaders!

Dear Virtual VW'er,

  I bought Ronnie's well known Side-Loader about 2 yrs ago in Jerome.  I
now have it fixed up just about the way I wanted it to be now and I will
post pictures when I get a digital camera.

  Since I've had the Side-Loader, I've become very interested if it had a
history of production?  I've spend days trying to find information on the
internet, but no luck yet (just a whole bunch of side-loading garbage
trucks!)  It does not have the m-codes or the doors that swing open like
the VW German Tiefladepritsche, "Tieflader" (flat-loader).  It does appear
to be coachbuilt - but does not have a serial/coachbuilder plate.  I
talked with Charlie Hammil who knew of at least 3 he has personally seen.
They all had the rail (truss) on the bottom (for frame flex) and the
diamondplate ramp - - My question is simply - anyone know any information
about a coachbuilder or were these built for a special purpose for
companies work fleet?

  For those who have not seen the 61 Side-Loader - Wade's, Thom's and
Everette all have pictures of the Side Loader under special models and
Jerome.

  I have also sent e-mail to the Virtual Vair's who have many neat web
pages on the Corvair Rampside, which was the original idea for a plank
like ramps on the side (http://www.mindspring.com/~corvair/fc1.html).
...Interesting is the out of 10,630 made, the Rampside outsold the Corvair
Loadside over 6-1!  The Rampside is similar in payload design to the VW
Single Cab with treasure chest doors that open from the top.)  I am
guessing that these were a direct competitor to the Rampside since the
production first year 61' was the same as my 61'?

Best,
joe
