Subject: wheel studs

Hey List,
I'm running 5 spoke Empi wheels on my 63 double cab. I
have a 66 front beam and an IRS beetle tranny. The
rear uses 12mm (the part the screws into the drum) and
the front uses 14mm. All I can find are the Bug Pack
wheel studs, which are about as soft as butter. If I
remove a wheel, I invaribly strip one or two wheel
studs. Does anyone know if I can buy a better quality
stud that won't strip so easily?? 

Thanks,
3DPete
