And I'd clarify that the front and back bolts are just that: 6mm bolts.
 There are capture nuts in the sheet metal (welded on inside the front
apron and the topside of the thin sheet metal at the back of the pedal
cover).  The cooling tin slotted head bolts would work fine there.  I
used a tap to clean out the threads when I worked on mine.

However, along the sides the pedal cover screws to the frame (at the
bottom edge of the "C") with no capture nuts.  It's thick enough to put
screws in, which I assume to be the self-tapping hex head 6.3x13 screw
sEric&Barb cite.  I have to qualify my observations with "at least on my
'67s it's that way" I don't have my Parts List handy.
