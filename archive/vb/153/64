Try the Porsche sources. Pelican parts or something like 
that. Probably pricy, but will last forever. 
My '63 DC is set up a lot like yours except I have a '68 
front beam, '72 disc brake spindles with Porsche cookie 
cutter wheels. I use the Porsche cap style nuts which 
seem too lightweight and flimsy, but they hold like 
crazy and haven't busted yet.
