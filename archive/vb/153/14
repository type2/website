When I got my Bus, the terminal on the choke heater was broken off in
a similar way - the rivet was still there but the tab itself was gone.
I cleaned up the rivet with a wire brush.  Then I crimped a regular
terminal on the end of a short piece of wire.  I soldered the other
end of the wire to the rivet, using a hot (140 W) soldering iron.
It worked fine and has been working that way for a couple of years.
