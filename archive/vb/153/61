yes. also get a NEW snap ring and a NEW stud for the 
mainshaft coupling (they have been re-designed and are stronger now). when 
installing the input shaft, screw on until snug, then BACK OFF the input shaft 
to the VERY NEXT SPLINE it lines up with then slide the reverse idler over and 
put the snap ring on.

good luck.

  I just finished removing the engine from my ' 63 Westy for a 
rebuild.  It is the first time I've had the engine out.  The 
trans

seemed to shift well, but I haven't driven the bus too 
much.  When I pulled the engine out, the input shaft for the trans 
came out

with it...There is a snap ring on the trans side of the shaft that was 
partially off,  and that's it.  What should be in the 
trans

to hold the shaft in?  Will I have to rebuild the trans too 
?

 

The snap ring holds the shaft in.

The input shaft is also splined into the reverse gear,

which has now fallen inside the diff  ( some disassembly required 
:)

This can be facilitated with either side cover / axle removed, as the

mainshaft is in the center. However, there may be other issues for

which the transaxle should come out for inspection.

( cleaning, worn syncros, bearings).
