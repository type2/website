Subject: re:leaky tranny

sounds like your boots/seals are leaking...i believe that when the boots are
installed-the seam should be up(front is front, but is up always up)and you
shoudl use some sealnt on them. I dont think these things fill with tranny
fluid-but some will definitely be in there, and if you have a crack in them,
they will leak there.
