Rick, my '65 standard came with nothing left of the rear interior fittings but the cab divider trim.  I built a rear seat from plywood using the westy folding 
bed hardware, and used "doorskin" plywood for interior panels.  Pics at http://www.supernet.net/~jclark/vw/65neunsitzer/index.html.  No plans - 
just used cardboard templates to get the dimensions just so before cutting the wood.  Hope that's of some use.
