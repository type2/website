After attending some great camping events held by other clubs we decided
to add a campout to our annual Volkstoberfest car show.  This is the
Melbourne, Florida Volkstoberfest not to be confused with any others out
there and I believe there is a couple.  Melbourne is about one hour East
and slightly south of Orlando for you Mickey fans or 15 minutes south of
Cocoa Beach for you I Dream of Jeannie fans.  The Campout will be held
at Space Coast Imports, our local VW shop.  The have a great grassy back
lot with plenty of room for everyone.  Check out www.GAVWC.com
<http://www.gavwc.com/>  for more details.  For you out-of-towners we
have all the Orlando area attractions, Kennedy Space Center, and the
Atlantic Ocean if you are looking to make a long weekend of it.

 

Thanks,

Dan
