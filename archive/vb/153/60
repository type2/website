Hi Sean,
Our 1960 panel camper, 1962 SO-34 Westie and 1963 SC all use the same bolts 
as used on the generator tin to the fan shroud.  This bolt size is also 
listed in our bus parts manual though the washer is differant.  This manual 
also lists N 13 890 2  self tapping hex. screw head 6.3x13, which is 
apparently for when the bolt holes strip/rust out later.
