Subject: re:bolts

I am not sure about whether or not the engine tins screws hold this front
pedal assembly cover on...but i know on mine it is a combination of sheet
metal screws and bolts. for the sheet metal screws-you can see that the
metal you are screwing into is too thin to have been threaded for a bolt.
