Hi Philip & Catherine,

  I hope they kept the drop plank, looks like it would be very time
consuming to fabricate one again if they wanted to change it back!  A
while back on Everett's site he had a picture of a Single Cab from Auto
Trader that did not have the drop plank, but had the bed and passenger
gate cut out for a side loader bay, I could not see if it had the truss
from the photo.  I can't see why one would weld one on a single cab, so
you are probably correct in your assumption.

Best,
joe
