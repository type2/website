Hi Donna,
Try going to Thesamba.com
then left click on "Classifieds".  Next page following that, left  click on 
"Search".
Once on search page, enter "Splash pan".
  1955-67 models will fit.  The very late 1966 and all of 1967  models have 
either a cut out or bubble for the longer to the rear and much  safer dual 
master cylinder that were installed in those buses.
