Subject: RE: [VB] underside update...RobK's Oz twin can just about  done

Saw Kevin and David's post and thought I should also
send a couple of pics of my (just about) finished 'hot rod'
bus - Leo, a 62 Oz twin cab.  Leo is irs, disced and lowered
and powered by a phat type IV .... I'm gerenrally a 'stock'
kinda person but he was so rotten and no one else was going to save him
that I had few qualms about making him my hotrod bus....

Pic above was taken at Australia's 'Day of the Volkswagen' show
held in Melbourne on 27th November.  Its one of the two largest VW shows held in
Australia (the other is the Nationals held in Sydney over Easter).
Leo took best modified bus which was pleasing 8-)...
