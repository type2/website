Subject: Maybe going up north to Alaska

For the first time in over 4 years my 66 sundial
actually ran down the road under its own power! My son
riding beside me called it a death trap-but he did it
with a big grin. As a long time listee who's gone into
lurk mode-maybe now I can get remotivated.

Good to have you back! Hope you all the luck on your
Sundial.
Maybe we will stop on by again this summer as we are
thinking of driving up to Alaska for a month or two.
We might drive up to Port Hardy and take the ferry
over to Prince Rupert just for the fun of it, and that
would take us right on by your neck of the woods.
Maybe maybe....
