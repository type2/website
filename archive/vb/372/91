Chuck,
  Another option is to use an entire wiper assy from a bay. I'd advise against using the '68, it's a one year only lashup. Check the archives. You have to replace the motor with a right-angle geared bug motor and deform the heater tube a bit to make it fit. Advantages are a beefier mechanism, 3 speeds and less rare wiper arms. Disadvantage? Extra work chasing down parts, less OG.
