Subject: Re: [T2] Starter won't turn over with key

IMHO you must check the electrical conmutator of the ignition switch, I have 
been having problems with my starter I turned the ignition key to the 
starting position and nothing happen I found that the conmutator was faulty 
after replaced it everything was O.K.
