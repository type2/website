Subject: Re: [VB] Busses and winter

 Just did a 5,000 miles road trip.
 
The 6V bus started no less well in winter than in summer.  
The heat is fine as long as the outside temps were above 30F.  Below 30 I have to put the shoes and gloves on and wanted another layer too.   An eberspacher auxiliary heater would be advised for regular subfreezing driving.  I think they were standard equipment in Canada.
 
A windshield washer would be good for the salty roads that kick crud up on the glass.. but you really don't want to drive an old bus in te winter were they salt the roads.  It's going to the car wash tomorrow am to knock te salt and ice off the underside and everywhere.
 
You can find the heater things that bolt on under the drain circle that plug into a regular outlet to keep the oil warm to ease starting.

Morning everyone,
   
  Quick question.  How does the busses fair in the winter?  (other than the 
interior heating issues :) ).  I'm in the process of purchasing a 66 bus.  It is 
for the love of the bus, but the bus will have to make a 50 km trip once or 
twice a week during the winter (it get's to -26 C here) in return.  Do the air 
cooled engines struggle more with starting up in the winter than the modern 
counterparts?  How much more so?  I know I can fix the heating problems, but 
need to have to car service year long for the family.  Thanks
   
  Jim.
