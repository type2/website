Subject: re:new gas tank install...and more..

Sorry about this groups of posts...i need to read my old emails more
closely. I thought I had asked the list about this a while ago, while I was
trying to get all the parts. Now that I have the parts-I was re-posting my
question.

I just did an archive search and found some answers...
"Lastly we cut or pull out the shorter reserve brass tube, this then helps 
keep the water out of the bottom of the fuel tank instead of trapping it
there."

The tap I got has a longer tube that is brass and a shorter one that is
plastic. Are you suggesting that I cut the short plastic one? It seems like
with the longer one in place, there is probably a couple gallons at the
bottom that you can never get to. Should I shorten this one too? IT is over
two inches long...
