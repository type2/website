The tap  I got has a longer tube that is brass and a shorter one that is
plastic.  Are you suggesting that I cut the short plastic one? It seems like
with the  longer one in place, there is probably a couple gallons at the
bottom that  you can never get to. Should I shorten this one too? IT is over
two inches  long...



Hi Kevin,
Are you installing a reserve switch?  If so the tall tube is to keep  an 
amount of fuel in the bottom of the tank so when you run out of fuel in the  
normal position, you switch to the shorter tube and have that reserve of fuel to  
get you to the next gas station.  Yes, shortening the shorter tube on  reserve 
switches gets rid of the water/gunk that collects in the gas tank and  rusts 
them out.  It is ALOT easier to just drain the carb if needed to get  rid of 
water in the fuel.
As for sealant.  NO.  Just use the proper gaskets and fuel filter  sock.
