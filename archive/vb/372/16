Subject: Loose connectors, tail light - 71 bus.

The connectors at the back are loose, and sometimes cut-out.  Can I 
replace just the bulb-holder, it looks like I can pry the front tabs 
off and slip it out, but I cant find a replacement via on-line 
search. Must I go the whole tailight assembly route?
