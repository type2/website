Not off the top of my head.  There is probably a
difference in thickness and turn count of windings, but
I've never put a 12 V and a 6 V next to each other and
counted.  There may be a part number on the outside
that will tell you what it was originally, and I _think_
the 12 V motors were stamped/marked "12 V".

Pull motor, disassemble gearbox, clean out old grease,
relube, reassemble.  It'll work a lot better.  On mine
the oil was separating from the grease, running down the
shaft, and fouling the commutator; if yours is doing that
it would explain the oil burning smell.  See

more tips.
