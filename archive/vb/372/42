Subject: Re: [VB] new gas tank install...and more...

Hi Kevin,
Forgot to mention that the threaded collar that connects the reserve switch  
and the tank, has LH and RH threads.  This allows you to hold the switch in  
one position and use the threads in the collar while turning it to pull the  
tank and switch together.  Whenever working on the reserve switch area make  
sure to disconnect the battery from at least one cable.  It is way too easy  to 
short out things under the post-1955 buses against the starter  terminals...
