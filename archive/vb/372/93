Subject: Wipers again

Since I see we are in wiper mode, is there a way to tell what ( 6V or 12V) armature is in the wiper motor housing? I have a 63 Panel and the bus has been converted to 12V by PO. Wipers were not hooked up since I've owned the bus and I have just gotten around to hooking up the linkages and turning them on for the first time. Motor sounds sluggish and wiper shafts are moving slow, also there is some smoke coming from the motor. Doesn't smell like electrical though, smells like oil burning. Any suggestions.
