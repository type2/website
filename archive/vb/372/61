I had this happen when I was trying to put an Ernst muffler on the 1500
SP in my Bus.  By engine number it's a 1500 from a '68 Bug but it's a
rebuild with two different heads so who knows what's going on in there.
With one muffler flange on the studs, the other one was 3 or 4 mm too
far outboard to fit.  A little "persuasion" made the muffler fit.
