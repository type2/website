Hi Kevin,
There is the parts manuals at:
_http://failsure.net/oacdp/_ (http://failsure.net/oacdp/) 
 
The sending unit part number is a correct VW  number.  The first "9" of 
middle three numbers tells you that  this part is in section "9" of the parts 
manual which is the "Electrical  Equipment" section.
   The 5mm screws are not self tapping for the sender.   Stainless steel 
screws would be better, but your old screws should work if  not rusty.  Make sure 
not to overtorque them and just cause leakage  problems by bending up the top 
of the sender, where it seals to the  gasket.  You can find the part numbers 
and size/thread pitch for the  screws and sealing washers there in section "2", 
Fuel Tank, Exhaust System,  Heater System.  Then feed the part numbers into 
"Search" (-at-) Wolfsburg  West and many other VW part suppliers.  Also the seal 
under the tank to  seal it to the body is listed in the manual.  Yes, we have had 
problems  with the OG felt that the tank sits on and between the hold  down 
straps and the tank, causing rust.  Tarpaper does work better to  keep rust 
away by not sponging up moisture.
  From what we have heard modern replacement reserve switches are  created 
backward.  So when you pull the reserve knob it runs in normal  mode.  Where the 
OG switches will go into reserve mode.  To fix this  in the later switches, 
one would have to remove and reinstall the tubes in the  opposite holes.  The 
"OFF" position should be in between the normal and  reserve positions.
  Otherwise it sounds like you have the procedures figured out!
