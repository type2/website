Chuck -

You didn't indicate the year of your van in this post, but after searching
my gmail I find that you have a 66.

Starting in 66, Bus wiper motors went to the "rotary" style of motor.  The
style that you have was utilized for only 2 years, 66 (6V) and 67 (12V).
Although 68 & later motors were of the rotary style, they are of a different
size so the armatures of those motors won't just "drop in".

Your best bet is to find a 67 12V motor that will directly swap over, it
will bolt right in.  If memory serves, the switch is the same so you should
not have to swap that as well.

Remember, both the 66 and 67 motors are "one year" style motors and can be
difficult at best to source.
