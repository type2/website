Subject: Re: Wipers again

Cleaned out old grease in my wiper motor, even cleaned the grooves in the commutator insulation (where brushes ride). Seems to run alot better but not at all quiet. Is there a bearing in there somewhere? I did not totally dismantle the motor. What kind of grease are you guys using? Speed seems ok, I did notice a pick up in speed but it doesn't seem to run fast to me.
