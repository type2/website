I'm pretty sure this wire goes to the generator light in the speedometer.
On the diagram for my '64, this one has a red bulb on the diagram.  The
high-beam light has a blue bulb, and the oil light has a green bulb.  (I
know they're all clear bulbs and the colors are provided by plastic
filters, but this is how they appear on the wiring diagram.)

The thin blue generator light wire travels with the fat red
generator-to-starter wire to the starter, then jumps into the main
bundle going to the front of the Bus.
