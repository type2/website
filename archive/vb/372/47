21st cruise to Wickenburg on December 4, 2005

By Remember When Cruise Association and Cops Who Care

Bring at least 1 new, unwrapped toy.

Meet at the Honeywell Parking lot on the northeast corner of I-17 & Union
Hills.

Coffee and Donuts.

Meet Time:  9:00 am

Cruise Time:  10:00 am

Start Time:  11:00 am

Please remember at 10:00 am there will be 150 people moving out of the spot
where the car show is to take place, so getting there early will only make a
bigger traffic jam.

We will be in the same location as last year.  We will have hot dogs,
bratwurst, and soda pop available, plus there is shopping and food within
walking distance.  

We will once again have Arts & Crafts and Vendors inside the Community
Center.  Spaces are available.  A non-commercial hobbyist is $5.00 and
commercial space is $25.00.  Call 602-943-3532 to reserve your spot.

For more information on the show call:
