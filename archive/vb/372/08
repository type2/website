Subject: Starter won't turn over with key

Happy Thanksgiving Everyone!
I have recently gotten my 1960 DD on the road but have had problems 
starting it with the key.  There is a wire that runs straight from the 
battery to the solenoid for starting when working on the engine. I never 
know when the bus might start with the key or not.  At first I thought 
it might be a "hot start" problem, but the bus would starter would not 
tun over this morning.  The starter does spin when I use the wire from 
the battery.  I tried to trace the problem this morning starting at the 
ignition switch and working backwards.  When I tuned the key to engage 
the starter, the test light showed current.  Next, I moved underneath 
the bus and clipped the test light to the wire from the ignition switch 
to the solenoid.  I had Casey, my ten year old daughter turn the key, 
and the test light showed current, but no starter action.  Then I went 
to the rear to get power straight from the battery to the solenoid and 
got the starter to whirl,  Frankly, I am stumped.  What wisdom can you 
lay upon this Kooky Math Teacher.  Do you think that a hot start relay 
may help my dilemma?
