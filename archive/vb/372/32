Subject: Re: [T2] Difference in starters?

From Jamie Auch:

Looks like I will probably order a new starter.  What is the difference 
between a starter for  manual or an automatic? I have one for an 
automatic in my (standard) bus now.  Thanks for the help.
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

A manual starter needs the bushing for the end of the starter shaft.

An automatic starter is self-supporting. 

The automatic trans starter will fit all 12V applications EXCEPT a 2.0L manual trans with a 228mm flywheel.
