Subject: re:new battery cable

I've tried a few times to determine where the voltage drop was on my bus,
without getting any consistent results. I could visually see that the
battery cable was not in great shape-so I figured I should replace it. 

I have soldered the fuse box, and taken the headlight switch apart and
fixed/re-soldered connections as per your recommendations.

Was writ:
Kevin have you checked with a voltage meter for where the voltage  drop is? 
 Have you soldered both the fuse box and headlight  switch?  If so, and
there is no detectable voltage drop, check out in the  1963-67 Workshop
Manual Volkswagen Transporter, section E-2, page 14.
