I'd be concerned about the working temperature of the undercoating. Did you use POR15?  I can't remember if it's affected by temp. 

I've used the cheap "chip" brushes from Harbor Fright with POR15 and they held  up pretty good. Did the foam dissolve into the undercoating? You're adding an ingredient! 

My son had the black wrist syndrome when I saw him at Thanksgiving. He's working on a BMW 2002.
