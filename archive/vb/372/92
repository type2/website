I am a member of the New Projects Development Department of Sunstar , manufacturers of  diecast scale model cars.
We are working right now in our new project, which is the VW Bus of the 1955-1957 period.
In order to make the model the most accurate,we need your help to find the owners of Westfalias, Bus and Delivery rust-free and 100% original, in near pristine conditions.
If there is any in the Philadelphia area, the better, but our priority is to find the best examples available, in order to  take pictures and accurate measurements.
Sorry for the inconvenience this can cause to you.
Best regards,
Sergio Goldvarg.
