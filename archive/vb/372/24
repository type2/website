Subject: The saga continues :was  Starter won't turn over with key

Well, here we go again!  I cleaned the ignition switch with contact 
cleaner, cleaned contacts and grounds, tightened up the starter and 
thought I was good to go.  I went out to the store and not start ;0(  
Went around to the engine bay hot start and got the bus going.  Went to 
the grocery store and when I came out still not start.  I went around to 
the engine bay hot start and nothing !  I then slid under the bus and 
with a big screw driver connected the two post.  All I heard was a 
whirl.  I guess it's time for a new starter?  What do you all think?
