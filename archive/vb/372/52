The difference is only .00625 mm, but as a screw is run into a hole that
is more than a few threads deep the tolerance will add up.  After 10
turns, the tolerance is .0625 or nearly a tenth of a thread, enough to
cause binding.  Also, the thread will not engage along its full length,
but will hvae the load concentrated at the far end of the screw, since the
tolerance buildup makes the screw thread come up a bit short.  Due to the
way the threads interact, you might have trouble keeping that screw tight!

So, the SAE screw will probably work fine in a regular thin nut where
only a couple of threads are engaged, but don't try it in a machined
hole!
