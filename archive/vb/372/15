hello Jim  As has been said  if you convert to 12 volt it works better , if 
you can keep the bus warm it will start better .    I use to drian the oil and 
remove the battery  Place both behind the wood stove for the nite then 
reinstall them in the morning . Bus would always start fine but it was a little more 
work that had to be done in cold condtions . Gas heaters are wonderful .   
Putting the battery on a trickle charger  would also work well  later and have 
fun  Mark Dearing
