First I should say Robert's DC is quite an accomplishment. Looks like a 
LOT of hard work. Thanks for bringing it back from oblivion. One 
question, how fast do you have to go to mold the license plate to the 
front bumper like that? Your color and trim choices look pretty good on 
a truck.

The popping went away after the lifter pumped up on the '79. Now it's 
quiet enough to hear the faint whine of the throwout bearing that 
transmits to the front pedal! Also hear a mysterious rattle when 
accelerating in first and 2nd. Almost like a rear wheel bearing binding 
a bit. We'll figure it out.
