Seth,
   You should pull the motor out and clean the 42 year old grease out of the gearbox and motor! If it runs really fast after that, it's probably still a 6v. If the speed seems normal (does anyone know how many wipes per minute?) then look for a long ceramic block in the wiring, a resistor. The swapped armature method is only a few years old, afaik.
