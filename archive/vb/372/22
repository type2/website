Subject: [VB] bus sighting in Nov 2005 issue of Car & Driver

Secod to last page of November 2005 "Car & Driver" magazine features the 
back of a well known bus ( well at least one I have seen ).  The caption 
is very flattering... Hint the bus is a small hatch with 67' style 
reverse lights and "40hp at work please pass" on the back
