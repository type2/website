"Only"?  IIRC this is on a '60, right?  It should be
putting out about 6 volts.  Either that or some
ne'er-do-well has surrepetitiously installed a 12 V
battery in your Bus...

> This could be the culprit!

Key question: how many volts was it getting in on
terminal 30?  If only 10 volts were coming in, the
problem is upstream of the ignition switch.

There will always be a little bit of a voltage drop
across the ignition switch, maybe on the order of
0.1 to 0.2 V.  But if there's much more than that,
then something is wrong inside there.

I've never had one apart.  I _think_ the metal cover
may be peened / crimped around the base to hold it on
to the plastic base, but I'm not sure.
