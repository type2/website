Sounds like syncros to me. My second gear doesn't shift right until I get
under 10 mph and then whines after I get above 15 mph.

gang,

my new-to-me 65 has a vibration/hum that is pretty obnoxious at 30-35 mph in
3rd gear, and mildly in fourth.

worst at steadily held speed.

better when accelerating.

disappears when taken out of gear.

Seems to me like tranny since it disappers out of gear.

Have not checked tranny fluid level yet, but it is obvious first place/lowest
cost to check. GL-4 right?

any thoughts are welcome,

thanks,

Billy
