Subject: vibration in 3rd/30-35mph

gang,

my new-to-me 65 has a vibration/hum that is pretty obnoxious at 30-35 mph in 3rd gear, and mildly in fourth.

worst at steadily held speed.

better when accelerating.

disappears when taken out of gear.

Seems to me like tranny since it disappers out of gear.

Have not checked tranny fluid level yet, but it is obvious first place/lowest cost to check. GL-4 right?

any thoughts are welcome,

thanks,

Billy
