That's exactly why there's some stuff I just won't bother selling on the
'net -
the effort to pack and ship it, and the shipping cost, far exceeds the
value
of the item. Thom - Thom Fitzpatrick 
----------------- Clip ------------------
I sell lots of parts to members on about five lists and from Limbo, Samba
and I don't mind ten dollar transactions but when it comes to NLA parts I
think I deserve a decent return on my investment since some of them were
collected five or more years ago.
What surprises me is that I sell three VW hubcaps for $10.00 and the
buyer can't make up his mind if he wants a $78.00 idle valve for an
additional $5.00.
I say skip the fries a few times and just buy the valve with the other
stuff.
I know VW folks aren't broke they just want a good deal.
To the best of my knowledge I've never overcharged anybody and I've never
shipped a defective used part.
