Your 67 did not come with a vacuum assist.   ( I have no idea what POs have 
done though)

Sounds like you need to bleed it.  Heck, why not flush the whole system, till 
nice clean fluid comes out at each wheel.

 Heres what I have going on ...My 67 westy daily driver brakes work 
 intermediately 
 when I run it to speed they work fine but if I run just from light to light 
 in city traffic then the brakes have to be pumped up before it will stop. I 
 have adjusted everything mechanically but starting to wonder if there's a 
vacuum 
 assist like on later buses?  >>
