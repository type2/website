Subject: Looking for a light switch...

Hi all,

Probably futile to try, but what the hell...

I'm trying to find and buy a NOS screw terminal USA spec. light switch for a
1959 Bus.  Mine is acting up on our "Busses Nowhere Near The Arch" event Panel
Bus, and yes I know that I can rebuild it with the excellent write up from
Eric, Barb and Matt Roberds (and I will someday soon).  But my first choice
now is to buy an NOS one, and then my second choice would be to buy a nice
used one.  At the 2003 Bad Camberg I bought a beautiful NOS switch, but it
turns out that it is a European spec. Bus switch without a terminal #57 and
with two terminal #30.  Anyone know if it can be easily converted or wired up
to function like a USA spec. switch?

Anyway, what I really need to get this Bus running perfectly again for the
upcoming event over the Labor Day weekend is a screw terminal type, USA spec.
light switch with the following numbered screw terminals:  30, 56, 57, 58, and
58b.  The distance on the mounting bracket should be about 30 mm from the
escutcheon face of the switch (where the shaft enters the switch) to the
centerline of the screw hole on the bracket.  Much longer than that and it's a
Type 1 Beetle switch.  Anyway, thanks for seeing if you have one available for
sale.  If anyone needs a NOS switch for a Euro spec. Bus, mine might become
available soon.

Thanks for looking!
