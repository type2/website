John, you said

Vintage from what vehicles (so I can find out timing)?

Right. I have an AE engine which I believe would've been from a 71 bus, which would've had vacuum advance. I want vacuum advance for the quality of the driving experience, as discussed.

If I identify my single carb part# (appears to be OG solex) is it then an easy thing to determine if/how to run the vacuum advance? There's a port facing me on the carb that has some kind of gum/goo keeping it closed. I'm suspicious of it's true nature.

Thanks much,
