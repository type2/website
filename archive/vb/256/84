Subject: porsche dizzy? (was rebuilt distributors)

John, list,

these posts have been very informative, thanks. I'm new to carbs and non-stock dizzy's with my new 65.

I've got this distributor currently:

bosch #0 231 129 019

It's cast iron, greenish, mech. advance only and the 
p.o. said it was from a "porsche", he's not a vw guy.

I'd like to get the SVDA set up that I should have. 
I have a 113 xxx 205 AN dizzy in the garage off a blown type4.

Can I use this? I think I can test it to see if it specs, correct? Would it be best to go brand new?
