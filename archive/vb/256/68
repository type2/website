Since you just got the bus, it is a great idea to check the axle boots, and 
drain the oil (center and both boxes) and refill it (change axle boots if 
needed when oil is out for less spillage).  Flush the brakes too.   change all 
fluids, at least. 

But I can't really tell what the noise is.  maybe a passenger could move 
around and maybe identify where in the bus it is coming from.   I have a noise in 
my 61 that happens at just the right speed, it is the side table rattling when 
there is just the right vibration.    A friend borrowed my bug and said there 
was a horrible noise at or above 35 mph, turned out she had taken the bungees 
off the roof rack, that were there to keep the rack from howling.    If you 
step on the clutch it may change the vibration as it isn't at a steady rpm 
anymore.  Trannies tend to have have whines, howls or rumbles, not neccessarily 
hums.  hope this helps.

<< gang,
 
 my new-to-me 65 has a vibration/hum that is pretty obnoxious at 30-35 mph in 
3rd gear, and mildly in fourth.
 
 worst at steadily held speed.
 
 better when accelerating.
 
 disappears when taken out of gear.
 
 Seems to me like tranny since it disappers out of gear.
 
 Have not checked tranny fluid level yet, but it is obvious first 
place/lowest cost to check. GL-4 right?
 
 any thoughts are welcome, >>
