Subject: Re: [VB] Wide 5 converter plates for late model discs

Narrowing the front beam is a fairly drastic & expensive solution, especially since I've then got to purchase the adapters on top of that.
Besides, I'm not even sure that regulations here in Australia would allow me to do that.
Are those rims going to fit under the front or not?
Any other solutions?
:o)
Cheers 
Andy
