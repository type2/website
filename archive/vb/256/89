Same here. About a year ago I went into a local VW
Dealer, Century VW in Loveland, Ohio to be specific,
with a problem with my wife's old Cabriolet. while
waiting at the parts counter, I notice this really
cool big vintage poster ad showing a sailboat packed
into a split window bus. So I say to the guy, "So can
you guys get me air-cooled parts for my 66 as well?" 
The guy looked at me and laughed. No lie, he actually
laughed! After a pause and him finally realizing that
I was asking a REAL question which required a REAL
answer, her simply said, "No."
