Greetings Tim,
Welcome to the list!  Best to respond to this list if it is VW and/or bus 
related.  One, we do not know everything, and with all the others knowledge on 
this list one can find out about just anything about VWs.  Two, if bad or out of 
date info is posted it is usually quickly corrected by others on this list!!  
We do not know of anyone for sure that makes the reproduction rack ladders, 
but you might try Tom Conner of Deer Park near Spokane who makes repro and 
custom racks!  His phone number should be in the archives or perhaps someone on 
this list has it handy.  Hopefully Tom can help you or someone else on this list 
may know of a ladder sourse.
