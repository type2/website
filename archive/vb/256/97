I'd think both should go bad at the same time, if they were replaced at the 
same time with the same make/age parts.   Then again, if just one was bad I'd 
have done thesame thing you did.   just take a looksee everyso often to see how 
they last.

 The PO told me that a '67 tranny had been swapped in for the original
 box right before I bought it.  When changing the right side boot I
 noticed the part number was a 113 number.  Do bus tranny center sections
 have a bug part number or is this a bug tranny center section??? >>

yes, the center section has bug part number, except the nose cone.  That is 
because it is the same part, only the ring gear is the other way round and the 
axles/btubes/RGBoxes are bus , and thenose cone is bus.   Your tranny is 
normal, don't worry.

remember in the idiot book where they say you can take a tranny out of a 
swing axle bug, swap nose cones, remove axles, flip ring gear and install bus 
axles?   It works, though you then get the bug 4th gear.
