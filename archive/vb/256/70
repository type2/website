Hi Billy,
Yes, GL-4 only!  Do check the gear oil level and go ahead and change it to 
see what metal fragments come out.  Could be you are low on the gear oil and 
this is causing the entire axle to flop due to no lubrication in the fulcrum 
plates.  BTDT!  Next have your tires balanced.  If that does not solve it then it 
probably is time for a rebuilt tranny.
  Then before you drive it anymore go through your bus supension, brakes and 
steering completely or risk becoming an unguided missle into large objects on 
and off the road!!!!!  Then replace flex fuel lines and go through the engine.
