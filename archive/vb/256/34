Hi Mario,
It does sound like a vacuum assist problem.  The only way to tell is to slide 
under your bus and look for a vacuum booster, and do repairs as needed if one 
is there.  If no vacuum booster then it probably is road dust/sludge in the 
MC causing the piston seals not to seal against the MC bore and can only be 
fixed by removing, dissassembling and cleaning out the MC.  If sludge is the 
culprit then one must R,D&C the slave/wheel cylinders also to prevent them from 
failing and this in turn drains/replaces the brake fluid so it is not full of 
all the attracted water in it to rust up all the cylinders and/or boil when 
often/extreme braking which will also fail the brakes.  This latter failure 
happened in a camp ground just a few years ago up here and a eight year old boy was 
hit and killed.  All because a minivan was running many years old brake fluid 
full of water, due to a badly written owner's manual that only stated the 
brake fluid needed to be changed every 40,000 miles and did not mention "or every 
two years whichever comes first!"!!!!
