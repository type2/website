Subject: Possible sale of camper to pull behind bus

I am thinking about selling my small camping trailer. It was made to pull
behind a motorcycle so is perfect to pull behind a bus. Very light weight
and compact, but folds out to a full size bed. It also has a small add a
room area that attaches for some extra space. I bought it with the intention
of painting it to match my 1971 westie but the bus does not even have paint
yet.
It is not perfect, but the canvas is great. I will ask $1,000, the exact
amount I paid for it several years ago, and it has been inside since I
bought it and only has been used 3 to 4 times.
I am posting this because it looks like several small kids will be with me
at High Country Bus Fest, so I will put the trailer hitch on the bus and
bring it for them to sleep in. I can take pics but have none at this time.
Please note: this is only a possible sale. If the kids throw a fit when they
find out, the deal is off. I just thought I would give anyone buying a
trailer anyway a hint to bring a hitch.
