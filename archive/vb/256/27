Hey all,

Some of you probably have heard about the big Yosemite excursion coming up 
July 11-16.  I've got a reservation for those dates in a really nice part 
of the campground, near some great people and all, but I have jury duty on 
the 14th and can't go.

Rather than call up the Park Service and cancel my reservation, allowing 
some minivan to take my spot, I want to offer the reservation up to anyone 
on the list who wants to join this awesome bunch on short notice.  The 
reservation is for five nights and six days and cost $90.  If you want to 
go, contact me now!  Because I will call the park service on Tuesday and 
cancel our reservation.

"Listen to the motor. Listen to the wheels. Listen with your ears and with 
your hands on the steering wheel; listen with the palm of your hand on the 
gear-shift lever; listen with your feet on the floor boards. Listen to the 
pounding old jalopy with all your senses; for a change of tone, a variation 
of rhythm..." - John Steinbeck _The Grapes of Wrath_
