<please fwd to the type II list>

I am basically to the trolling stage anylonger. Just wanted to pipe up to say
that amongst all of the over priced junk that is FS in today's market one
vehicle that is well worth looking at has become available.

Splitbus email list or not, I give my unreserved recommendation for this 69
hardtop Westfalia which is currently located in New Mexico, USA. Unabashedly, I
wish that I could afford this bus for my daily driver. Alas, I can't! =(

This is one of the cleanest and most original Bay-Westfalias that I have ever
seen. Contact the seller if you are even remotely considering purchase of a
bus~ splittie, bay or pre-'86 Vanagon. Extremely wonderful ORIGINAL buses are
getting to be impossible to find! This is one bus that I would keep for about
ten years or more. 

IMHO anyone who modifies this bus* ought to burn in VW hell. 

*exception given to the purist who should take the carbs back to bone stock
should they so choose. I would leave it as is and retain/obtain the parts to
make it 1000% stock if the wild hair should arise.

If anyone wants to give me $10,000. for a '94 F150 Supercab (180,000 miles), a
1980 Diesel Dasher with a salvage title and a nice '63 EZ camper PLEASE call
the seller of this '69 first and tell them that Jim Ellis will contact him in
five minutes.

Good luck and safe motoring.
