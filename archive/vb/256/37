Hi VW,
First are you using the correct seal?  If so, it is a "T" shaped profile and 
the lower end of the "T" should be pointing toward the chrome of the headlight 
bucket.  Lastly these often do not seal completely because the chrome rings 
or the screw tabs have been bent over time and really this seal is only to help 
seal out the water.  Letting any water that gets by out through the drain 
hole in the bottom of the chrome ring and cushion the headlight bucket from 
riding directly against the paint of the VW body.
