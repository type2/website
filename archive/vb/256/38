Subject: June's OCTO Shirt Question...

Hey all,

I was wearing my OCTO shirt from last month's event and took a moment to 
just admire the back of it.  I'm always impressed with the artwork and the 
quality of the colors.

But then I noticed something...Can anyone in the know confirm or deny that 
the Westy in line on the shirt is actually Ricky "Been Travelin All Over 
the US" Fu's '66 Westy and the Dormobile is acutally Susan Dolvin's (fmr. 
Crandall's) "Zapper" Dormy?

I'd swear they're dead-ringers for the originals!

"Listen to the motor. Listen to the wheels. Listen with your ears and with 
your hands on the steering wheel; listen with the palm of your hand on the 
gear-shift lever; listen with your feet on the floor boards. Listen to the 
pounding old jalopy with all your senses; for a change of tone, a variation 
of rhythm..." - John Steinbeck _The Grapes of Wrath_
