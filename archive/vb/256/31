Hi Ronnie,
Well we should have said "15" type 2 rims" instead of pre-1968 rims.  Duh!!  
Does look like the modern radial problem is the same for the 1964-1/2 through 
JULY1970 14" type 2 rim.  According to the 1968-78 VW/Bentley "Official 
Service Manual", the small five 1971 and later rims here in the N. America and 1972 
and later in Europe are 1/2" wider so the radial could be factory equipped on 
the bus.  Previous rims were bias ply equipped.  
  According to "Without Guesswork" in the 1960-1970 edition:
type 1 rim is 4" wide.
15" type 2 rim is 4-1/2" wide.
1964-12 up through JULY 1970 is 5" wide.
