Hi Ronnie,
Lovely!  Why can't volks just install a bug handle instead to prevent doing 
that kind of damage....  You can check the VW bus parts manual through Thom's 
vintagebus.com website.  You are probably going to need a bus lock to replace 
what you have or repair what you have by taking apart your lock and cut and 
weld on the shaft of a bug door handle shaft that has the same sized splines.
  As for the sunroof bug get it for an in town daily driver!
