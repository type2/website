Hi Ronnie,
In back as in a walk thru bus?  If so then you are stuck with a type 1 radial 
165SR15 on a bus 15" rim as a short distance get to the nearest tire place 
for repair or replacement of the bus sized radial.  The pre-1963 front bench 
seats with the two adjustments to the seat back can fit in the 205/75R15 as a 
spare if you do not mind having the seat back adjusted forward.  The later front 
bench non-walk thru 2/3 bench seat does not have this adjustment and we are 
pretty sure you are stuck again with a 165SR15 radial.
