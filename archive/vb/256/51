Subject: swap sunroof parts from bug to bus?

My 64 21 came with no sunroof handle and all the splines stripped off where
it attaches from years of vice grips rounding it out. I know of a local rag
top beetle that could be had cheap and I'm wondering if that whole latch bit
might be the same as a bus?
