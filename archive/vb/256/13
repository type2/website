Local ghetto used tire place = $1-$2 cash
I had 4 tires removed for $5 about a month ago and the guy gave me a stack
of VW hubcaps so I came out ahead.  I also got some cool old school VW
stories from him.  ;)

First, go Fed Ex ground, it's cheaper.  Second, you don't need a box or any
packing.

I would say $25 each for nice, rust free rims if someone is buying them mail
order.
