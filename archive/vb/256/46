There was a guy in Arizona a few years ago who was selling repros for $75 a 
pop. Non-folding kind.   They looked nice, wish I'd have gotten one when I was 
there, but cash was tight.  Any AZ listees have any repro info?  Recently saw 
a really neat roof rack with a buildt in ladder.  you pulled the ladder down 
out of a sheath on the roof.   Think it was a german police bus deal.
