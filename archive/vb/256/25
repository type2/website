 I bought an old surface-rustyall metal roof rack off a
 guy, he had the folding ladder which goes with it, but
 wouldn't sell it to me. He said they're extremely
 rare, and the last one he saw was for sale for $450.

They are rare.  But that guy's dreaming.

I saw one for sale, and I didn't want to pay the $150.    But I don't know 
''what they are worth"
