OK,
I know I don't want to perpetuate a stereotype, but by frugal Scottish 
lineage is screaming right now.

I have removed many tires at home, the key is breaking the bead free from 
the rim.

You ask, how does one do that at home?

You put the wheel and tire in the driveway and have a friend stand on the tire.
Friend will guide you while you sit in your car and drive forward to run 
your car's tire over the tire you are trying to remove.
Friend should aim your front tire so that the outside edge is a few inches 
away from the edge of the rim.
slowly drive over the tire.
if the tire is a clock, the direction of travel is from 6 to 12
tire crosses at 9
friend stands at 3

on the next pass move in an inch
and then again move in an inch
on one of those passes it will break loose.

If too much bite is taken the tire will want to pop up and hit the car so 
take it easy.

You can then use crowbars to remove the tire.

If you are having difficulties with the crowbars, a sawzall will make short 
work of the bead and tire and it will fall right off.
