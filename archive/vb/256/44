Subject: Re: Folding Ladders Variations

I have two folding ladders--The first one has the VW logo stamped on it, at
the part that catches the roof or rack. The 2nd one, I just purchased from
the original owner who had it on his new 1967 Bus--This one is stamped "HWE"
and was purchased at the VW dealership in 1967--He still had the original
German 82" metal roof rack with the German decal, and all 6 "Horseshoe"
clamps  -- But the interesting item that was part of the deal, was something
I have never seen--An extendable clothing bar that fits across the inside of
your bus-- He said he also bought this at the VW dealership here in
Phoenix--
When the  two folding ladders are placed side by side--there is a difference
in the placement of the one set of legs that rest against your bus--

Now I have got to locate a 1966 or Older VW bus to put this rack on !!
