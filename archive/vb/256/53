Quick question Rex,

 

The emergency brake handle-does it come straight back on the bus.or is it
slightly angled towards the driver? Not sure if you guys remember but mine
was stuck about a month ago-a little penetrating oil sprayed on it seemed to
loosen it up. Now when I look at it-it seems kind of cocked to one side, and
I don't remember if it was always like this or not. I am thinking maybe the
pin on mine is bent/broken somehow, and that is why it was so hard to move.
Except that it moves pretty good now..

 

Thanks for any ideas.
