Subject: battery

Hate to  submit so may questions but here's another
Besides the two bugs I mentioned earlier
Another son of mine has a 66 split window bus.I am needing to replace the
passengers side
taillight because the battery has been slamming into it. There was no
battery tie down when we bought it. Our current battery is probably larger
that the old 6V (if my memory serves me right)
Before I buy a generic and start drilling holes is there any better choices
out there. There seems to be some metal projection on the battery area
floor(?) and one on the wall behind(?) the battery. There is no rust in the
area now, I am afriad drilling holes will make the battery area vulnerable
to it.
Thanks Again
