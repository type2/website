Subject: Re: [VB] removing axles from splitcase tranny?/bentley edition?

 axle shaft 211 501 201 is the only one listed in the 58 edition and the 63 
edition (updated through ~70) of bus parts list.    no different axles for 
bd.  There are a couple different colours of dots for tolerances/wear.  Ha 
ha, they re all so worn now.  Keep any unworn spares found for future 
rebuild.  Anyway, seems you're good to go just swapping the tubes and boxes 
over.
Ya-  you'ld have to split the case to change the axles.  :(

FWIW, the center section changed at the beginning of 54 from the crashbox to 
the synchronised splitcase.  This center section was used through May 59 on 
buses.

In early 55 (at 20-117 902) they started the post bd splittys and went to the 
55-63 /tubes/rgboxes, 

with the bd rgboxes, check the spring plate nuts.  they seem to get loose, 
and then you get a funny thunk in the back and the spring plates get grooves 
worn in them.

I though the early bus (pre62) Bentley was going to be out in September (Hey! 
That's now!)  This includes the 53, 55, and 59 edition, so it'd have the 
36hp, splitcase, barndoor stuff, right?   They were going to be about $120?  
what's the story?

 I actually want to remove the axles so that I can
 fit the original barney reduction boxes - they're
 sorta split around the springplate
 (like a kubel...).
 
 I must admit I have immediately assumed the axles
 would have to be changed cos the barney reduction
 boxes look so different ..... 
 
 Can anyone tell me if this is actually the case?
 Or are the axles the same in a barn and the 'later'
 post 54 splitcase tranny?
