Subject: Camper headliner

Hiya List,
I'm getting ready to go through my 67 Sundial interior.  I'm wondering about
the pieces that are curved, such as the headliner, which is curved both at
the sides and the front and rear of the roof section, the piece that makes
up the curved top of the arm on the left of the folding rear seat, and the
piece that goes above the spare-tire well in the rear.  Has anyone had any
experience in replacing/bending these wood pieces?  Do they need to get
soaked in water, which seems like it would raise the grain of the wood, or
perhaps steamed in order to make the bends without cracking the paneling?

TIA,
Ed
