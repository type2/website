Okay, going back later this week so can take a proper look then at the
archives.
I think Ronnie said earlier that the Beetle MC was too small, is this small
as in fluid volume within the cylinder? Or as in the diameter of the piston?
I don't understand why he would have to push harder to stop the bus causing
early failure of the MC - I suppose as the pedal effort is less, less fluid
is being moved so the force on the brake cylinders is less.
I expect this has all been covered before so I will have to check the
archives though.

Thanks
