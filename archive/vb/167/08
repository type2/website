Paul,

I didn't explain why a bigger diameter master cylinder causes you to 
have to push harder on the brake pedal in my post yesterday and I 
probably should have. The thing to remember is that in a hydraulic brake 
system, the force you apply to the brake shoes is a result of the amount 
of pressure (lbs/in^2 or N/mm^2) in the brake fluid. You make the 
pressure in the brake fluid with the master cylinder. As the diameter of 
the master cylinder get bigger, the area you are pushing on to make the 
pressure gets bigger (that's the in^2 and the mm^2, ^2 means squared), 
so you have to push harder on the pedal just make the same pressure in 
the system that you had before you put in the bigger diameter master 
cylinder.

When you get to where you can see the net again take a look at this 
page: http://www.howstuffworks.com/brake3.htm

They explain it better than I can and they have pictures too.
