Subject: Re: [VB] Front Shift Rod Coupling: Why cut/weld rather than

I don't think welding it back together would be a good idea.  Cutting it
lengthwise is the way to get it off without gouging the actual shift rods
too bad to the point where a new coupler would not go on.  Just buy a new
coupler and set screws.

at $8.00+$1.75+$1.75=$11.50 total, I wouldn't trust a weld.
