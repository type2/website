Kevin-
Lock up the endplay with another shim and
measure again to isolate the thrust error.
Your current updated endplay measurement is still including
the thrust error- subtract it and the real endplay will be less.

I have found that there is a range of tolerance in new main
bearings- Koblenschmidt is the fattest on the case side , Mahle is next, and
Metal Leve is smallest- This is all in a range of tenth's inside of
.001"-.0015"
This is not to say that one is better than the other, just that everything
must be measured- It may be such that you get a better fit with one
than the other. Remember, a crank is only .001" from fresh to worn out.
Same with the case. That clamping force is around .001"- .0015".
Just picture the effect on the center main- it is a split shell and is held
only on the dowel. And runout on a good crank is .001"  Lots of things
here are only good inside .001"

You can get lots of miles with what you have right now. It'a a running
engine.
You can mount it back in easy enough to take a cold compression test.
( Correct way is with a warm engine, but cold #'s indicate a trend ). ).
Take it apart, and it's just parts, many of which won't be reinstalled on a
rebuild.
*Cam plug in backward ? That is your major clue. Take it apart and you will
find more.
The bearings are marked, and the crank measurement will tell you what you
have now.
When they didn't mic the case, there was a big unknown regarding that
clamping force
which the factory requires to make a full service life. Don't make the
measurements, and
you can wind up with a brand new worn-out engine.

That case is actually made of peanut butter, it expands and contracts.
There aren't that many main bearings to hold that spinning mass of forged
steel,
certainly no extra ones. They need to be stable to control it. Let one end
run loose
and vibration does the rest.

I'm in western NY. In addition to align-bore, I also powdercoat my cases.
This combines stress-relief with an attractive finish. But that's just list
flame-bait.
