I have recently purhased two beetles.
I was trying to find out about the bugs from the VIN.The web site said to look
under the front fenders and If I saw springs it was a Super Beetle. There are
springs surrounding the top part of the front shocks. Are there the springs
the web-site was talking about??
the VIN's are
Graham's Bug 1122251959    Claren's Bug 1342116479

 Does VW have a web-site for VIN info  breaking down the numbers meanings. I
have used other web sites for my 65 Chevy PU Tk. The info was really helpful

Thanks
