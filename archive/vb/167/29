Subject: Re: [VB] Finding Type I and II on E bay.

Try surfing over to eB*y Motors at
http://pages.ebay.com/ebaymotors/index.html?ssPageName=ML01 and use the
search engine there instead.  That will filter out the thousands of
Matchbox, Hot Wheels, Johnny Lightning, etc. bus toys and leave you most
of the real automotive items.
