Boulter plywood, 24 broadway here in somerville has it and they ship
nationwide. 617 666-1340.

The place i used to get it from in houston was called "hardwood
lumber"-their prices if i remember correctly, were a good bit cheaper-but
you still need to pay for shipping. no idea what shipping costs are. and i
cant find the price lists for either.

Kevin do you have a MA source for Baltic Birch, my winter project is to redo
my interior.  I found this site: www.getwood.com
but they're in NJ.

Thanks Don.
