Good to hear from you agian Matt, I was the one parked next to you with the
'76 yellow westy pulling a Scamp trailer.  Next summer, I hope to have
either a '63 Turkis hard top deluxe or a '64 Double Cab doing the pulling
honors.  Of course which either bus I use, it will have an upright 2 liter
for the power plant.  Out here in the Midwest as you know, the closest
campouts are at least 6-8 hours away and having the extra pulling power
makes for a much shorter trip.

Anyway, what you have is a REAL Z bed.  Most people mislable the Westy
folding bed as a Z bed, which is not correct.  Here is the site for your
bed:

Hope to see you again at a campout.  I'll be heading up to the VW Fest in
Herman about an hour west of St. Louis in a couple weeks, maybe I'll see you
there?
