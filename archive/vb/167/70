McMaster Carr is a supply house of sorts. There are 4 or 5 around the
country. they are pretty amazing...the amount of stuff they carry. their
website is www.mcmaster.com They have a catalog which is even easier to look
through, it is huge, ~ 3" thick. Unfortunately a hardcopy of the catalog has
historically been difficult to obtain. Although that may have changed in the
last few years. You need to time your request to a publication date-which i
think varies every year.

but the online version has everything the book does-and is actually up to
date(my catalog is a couple years old)

They have everything in their catalog in stock, and delivered to your door
the next day.

   What is McMaster carr. I would like to sound dampen my son's 66 bus. The
dynamax
insulation is very exspensive. I would like to find some less exspensive
alternatives
Thanks
