Hi Terry,
Thanks for your reply.

I am using a "Scrap" Sundial interior to pattern off of, so I can do some
pretty exact measurements of the pieces that I am replacing as well.

Sounds like you own a Westy with the 5X5 panels and all.  Not too sure what
you mean by the two corners?, but I'm sure I will figure it out.  I've
spoken with others who have done their interiors over, and I'm kinda
surprised that there are no instructions posted on anyone's website about
this task.  Maybe I'll take photos and write instructions and post them
somewhere.

Anyway, thanks for your help and advice.  That goes for everyone here on the
list that responded.  Wish me luck, and I'll let you all know about the
results.

Ed
