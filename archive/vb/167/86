Get a test light and check power at the dimmer switch.   use the wiring 
diagram to find which is power to the switch.  make sure it works 
w/headlights on.   step on the sitch- that shouls stay on.  find which fuse/s 
run the high beams- low beams- make sure they get power.  etc.  Trace the 
power from start to finish.  This technique may help find the problem.

 I've got color printouts I use of the diagrams on Thom's site. Been using 
 them all along, they're great. Everything looks like it is hooked up as it 
 should be...only thing I'm not sure of is the dimmer switch. It's an 
 aftermarket switch w/3 prongs and no labels on the terminals. 
 
 Could all this be caused by my hosing down the cab floor? Some light spray 
 may have gotten on wires/fuses/relay. They are bone dry now, and no sign of 
 anything, but I thought I'd ask.
