Subject: Re: [VB] Camper headliner/hauling firewood in a bus

I recently removed the interior from a Riviera camper to redo it.   The back 
piece by the spare tire (it's a walk through) had been sanded down through a 
ply of the plywood on the not showing side of the wood.
Not sure what you mean by the other pieces, but although pre bending wouldn't 
hurt, you do not need to pre bend the wood for the ceiling panels, the curve 
isn't that tight.   It is crucial to have the shape of the over-the-driver 
roof panels correct for a good fit, and make sure the panel fits easily into 
the slot on the air vent.

With the interior bare, you can fit a lot of firewood in a kombi.    We got 
two loads yesterday.    I have a pic if anyone is interested. -still gotta 
learn that webpage stuff.

<< Hiya List,
 I'm getting ready to go through my 67 Sundial interior.  I'm wondering about
 the pieces that are curved, such as the headliner, which is curved both at
 the sides and the front and rear of the roof section, the piece that makes
 up the curved top of the arm on the left of the folding rear seat, and the
 piece that goes above the spare-tire well in the rear.  Has anyone had any
 experience in replacing/bending these wood pieces?  Do they need to get
 soaked in water, which seems like it would raise the grain of the wood, or
 perhaps steamed in order to make the bends without cracking the paneling?
