It has occurred to me that that parts book does have barndoor parts
listings in it so saying it "starts" in 1958 is not very accurate.

Also, I think that when VW went to microfilm for their parts books,
the only Bus parts lists they did on film were for the '68-up models;
the splitty lists were still on paper.  *

You can see a bit of this in the first few pages of the online '67 parts
book in the "Supplement x" pages.  These apparently came along with each
set of parts book update pages and listed all the supercessions and NLAs
in one place.

I agree.   I'll try to say just "'54 parts list" or "'67 parts list"
for the online ones.

* Compare that to the place I worked in 1991-1994 which makes jet engines,
locomotives, light bulbs, and appliances.  I sold appliance parts - our
computer lookup only went back to the early 1960s but our parts microfilms
went back to the late 1940s.  Some of the early 1950s parts were even still
available, like refrigerator door latches and door gaskets.  I worked at
an inbound call center which was later worked-out to a place in Arizona
at $8/hr and recently six-sigma'd to India for maybe $3/hr.  I wonder
how many refrigerators and washing machines the employees in India buy?
