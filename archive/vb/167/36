Therefore, if you use a smaller diameter master, you
will exert (for example) twice the pressure for the
pressure applied, BUT you will have to travel TWICE
the distance, which will wear out your rubber in no
time, AND give you a very low pedal!

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but this seems a VERY
dangerous condition!!!
