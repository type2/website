I don't think he would like it this way. From the beginning they wanted cash
up front or they don't act. I never shipped any vehicles so I didn't know
any better and sent payment via FedEx right away. From that point on it was
just call in a few days, call in a day or two, check status on the internet,
bla, bla, bla. My fault, I should not hire the cheapest..... I'm cheap
though most of the time but sometimes I just loose my pants because of that.
Like I said before, I'll pay the extra $200.00 and forget about it.... and
hope to get my Bus here pronto.

At some point I have mentioned to those girls that work for him that I have
some contacts with various groups, lists and boards and that good service
might earn them a good word every time someone wants to ship a car.... seems
they don't care. They don't even answer my e-mails anymore. I think my last
phone call was answered by this owner guy, someone that doesn't give a dime
what I think..... he's got my money and it's me now that has to worry how to
get the whole thing finished. People like this though stay in business for
some time and then just go bankrupt without understanding that it was their
own fault. I just thank God that the community answered and helped me a lot
with this issue. PO was not a list member but people here know this Bus and
thanks to them It's a bit easier on me.

Thanks guys and let's just hope I get it home soon, real soon..... like
before winter so I can still take it on the road and have a little bit of
fun....
