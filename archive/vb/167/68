Thermo ply is a cardboard product that is fire retardant.
It comes in two grades : Red and Green, the color of the sheet will
always be gray.
The Green is lighter in weight than the red, cost about the same.
If you want to upholster it with wall fabric that is glued on with
contact or other adhesive you'll need to take Coleman Lantern Fuel (or
other non stinko cleaner) and remove the paraffin coating on the panels.
It cuts good with a utility knife and even better with a steel straight
edge.
I just finished the interior of my 66 Westy and it looks good in gray.
The headliner and front kick boards have conformed very good after being
held in place for a few days (they now hold their shape when removed.)
I have a wrinkle near the back on both sides of the top panel but some
more waiting or a slight adjusting cut might be just the cure.

 Is the product you recommend wood-grained as well.
Kinda looking for some nice paneling to do my interior with, and $5 a 4X8
sheet doesn't sound too decorative. Thanks again, Ed
