Subject: alternator help

Howdy Volks,

I have a motorola alternator in my SC with 1600 dp.  I am a new owner and
DPO had this truck for around 3 years and did nothing to it and drove it
very little.
Alternator is not charging.  I pulled it out and had it tested, bench tests
fine.  So on to wiring.  It has one wire going to the battery (by way of
starter) and one going up to the dummy light on the dash.  Now, my
understanding is that that second wire needs to tie into the ignition switch
somewhere to excite the windings?
There is vague mention in a Hayes 1600 book I have to that effect.  Any
ideas on where that wire should go and how the dummy light ties in?  As an
aside, and definitely related, the dummy light is burned out.  Where does
one buy more of those little buggers?

TIA
Wes and '58SC
