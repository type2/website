I did this about a month ago on my '64.  I used a cut-off wheel in a
Dremel to make two lengthwise cuts (parallel to the shift rod) just
above and below the setscrew.  This left me with a C-shaped piece of
coupler and loosened it up enough that I could get the front shift
rod off.  Once it was out I made another cut on the other side to
get the C-piece off the front rod.

Yes.  Pretty sure mine came from WW too.  The problem with mine was that
the ID was too _small_.  I slid under the Bus with it loose, figuring
I could just slip it over the front shift rod - no such luck.  Had to
come back out, stand the front rod on the ground, and tap the coupler
onto it with a hammer to get it on.
