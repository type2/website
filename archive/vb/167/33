361 is a bunch of stuff including a sliding door which doesn't make
sense on a Doppelkabine.  The decoder above says the color is Titian
Red but another reference I have says Titian Red was only available
in '66,'67, and '68 (and then again as a metallic in '87 through '90).
The only red color in '59 did indeed appear to be Sealing Wax Red.
