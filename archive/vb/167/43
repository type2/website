Subject: Door Window Help

Well I finally have both window frames removed from the truck. I'm looking 
for some help/advice on installing new seals and then reinstalling frame. Do 
I need to cut the rubber? What glue should I use? I have Bentley 50-62 which 
has one or two pics, but I'm looking for more detail. I've read some stuff 
here about the vent window...my rubber is pretty shot, having been in the 
Utah desert for 40 years...is the channel packing stuff the way to go?
