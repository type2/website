normally barndoor buses have 19mm master cylinders.  However, if the crusty 
one on the bus is bad, you can physically install a cheap. easily available 
55- 66 mc (21mm), w/o mods.  When I got a 19mm/bd one, I installed it.  the 
bigger was tighter, the smaller gave more squish, and better feel... less all 
or nothing.  So bigger means more force per effort.   Now the physocs whizzes 
will explain why this happens
