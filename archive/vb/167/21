Subject: Front Shift Rod Coupling: Why cut/weld rather than tap?

Hi,

I have to get my front shift rod out of the way so I can take care of 
the center pin. Like everyone else, the coupler set pin that holds the 
coupling in place is broken off and rusted in place.

Bus Boys in their instructions say to cut the coupling off lengthwise - 
and I think that was E&B's solution (from the archives). Why isn't 
tapping out the set pin easier than cutting and then having to weld the 
coupler back together? Is tapping out the pin that difficult? I can 
twist the shifter rod to get a good angle on it.

Also, if the coupler is made of soft metal, it seems that cutting and 
welding would introduce possible fatigue-related failure later on.

If I am supposed to cut the coupling off lengthwise, I am assuming that 
I cut it with the cut intersecting the set pin/screw hole?

Thanks in advance for your guidance.

Thanks,
Conrad
