Subject: baltic birch

actually 5'x5' is a fairly standard size for this stuff. price varies-due to
source. When in houston i learned a bit about it from an amazing lumber
yard. there is baltic birch from russia-which is very cheap, and stuff from
europe, which is much more expensive. the quality is very comparable- to the
point where they are probably indistinguishable.
