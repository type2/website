Ronnie,I am still looking for the information on the German and Brazilian,
(and Argentinean "spelling?"), foundries that cast the VW/Porsche(lo end
only)/Audi components. It's been several years now since I had them in hand,
but it was at a time I was interested in the 78/79 Brazilian syncro bus and
the Amazonian motorcycle which used the 1600 motor. I will find it, I
will....

   Yes they are forged up till a certain year when they went to cast. Also I
am not positive on this but all engines either built in Mexico and/or Brazil
have cast cranks (I do know for sure the last 7 years). One of the biggest
problems I see in  WELDED CW cranks is that they are using a lot of cast
cranks now, being that old forged cranks are getting harder and harder to
find in rebuild able condition. In order to get a 10/10 forged welded weight
C W crank you need to turn in a standard standard, if you turn in a 10/10,
you get a 20/20 on and on. Core charges are going out the roof, probably why
Berg doesn't sell just a CW crank alone.
   When you see welded CW cranks in the mags at low prices they are either a
welded cast or cut more then 20/20 and will have welded journals or even
more. 
  Remember S I R VW engines, they were well known for welded journal 20/20
20/30 cranks etc.  They used to get cranks from D P R till they figured out
they could make more money doing there own, probably one of the reasons they
are gone!
