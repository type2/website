Subject: Front Shock Replacement HELP

In the process of changing out my front shocks and ran into a
problem. The metal spacer that fits inside the rubber bushing is stuck
on the stud attached to the front beam. Does anyone know an easy way to
pop it off. Any help would be greatly appreciated...

Thanks
