Somehow this seem backwards to me. As I think this through it would seem
to me that 10LBs of pressure on a square inch bore would create 10LBs
per square inch. If you put 10LBs of pressure on 1/2 square inch bore
you would generate 5LBs per square inch of pressure. Therefore it would
seem a smaller bore would require more foot pressure. Corrections?
