Subject: 63 to 64 emergency brake cable housing different lengths ?

After the  Big nut trans swap into the '63 the 64-67 E- brake cable housings
are (about 22" long)  to short( 9"or so) to go from the BACK of the backing
plate to the metal tubes on the body.  Does anyone remember if the <63 and
the 64< cable housings are the same length ? Or if the metal tubes on the
body are different lengths toward the back (<63 to 64<)? I want to use the
cable housing with the right ends to keep water out of the tube end and the
backing plate end...    any ideas ?
