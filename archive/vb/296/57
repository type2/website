berg has pumps with o-rings (i have one) - but they go AROUND the 
pump body where it fits into the engine case , NOT between the face 
of the pump and the pump cover. that circular slot in the face of the 
pump is there to relieve pressure on the cover if i recall 
correctly...
did the empi pump have a small groove milled arounf the pump's circumference?
