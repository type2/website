Subject: web site back up...

Hi All,

 

Thanks for all your suggestions yesterday regarding my need to move my
site and find cheaper hosting.

 

I found it and even registered my own domain name instead of being a sub
directory off of my business web.

Actually, this is the best just in case the big bad corporate world
forces me out of business (long story which a few of you know).

 

I still need to edit a few things like the home page but I'm off to
lunch at the moment.

 

 

Enjoy, and please let me know if there are any issues with the new site.
