Subject: RE: [VB] Re: Vent Wing Window Problem

Does anyone need a part time occupation? Set up some jigs, practice on Bug vwings until you're an expert, then go into business. Branch off into other classic vehicles if you'd like. Become the Vent Wing Assembly Guru of the Universe! Just a suggestion, my brain wasn't doing anything else.
