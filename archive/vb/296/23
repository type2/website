In the process of changing armatures in my wiper
motor.

three spade fittings # 54d-31b-54 It's my guess this
is a 6 volt motor??

while checking the archives, repacking with new grease
is called for. Question, what type of grease, white
lithium?
wheel bearing? And would it be prudent to fill the
cavity?
or a third full?

after taking it apart there's smaller fiber gear, it
appears not be attached to any thing other than to
join the larger gear...

just took  a closerlook this fiber gear looks like it
once had a shaft going up thru the bottom, there is a
hole in the plate where this shaft was
 I may have found the reason this motor quit working,
I may be able to replace this shaft with a finishing
nail.

The vendor has the armatures in stock,& if this is a
6volt motor I'll have it ready to install by friday
