Eric,

I used the standard WCM seal and they lubed it with soap when they were
installing it. It all goes in there, but it takes a steady even push,
preferably in a proper jig. They didn't even scratch my paintwork either.
Five minutes and both were done. Ronnie says they don't do anymore, but
I'd call anyway.
