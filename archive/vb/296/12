Subject: TIME TO BEG FOR A BOLT !!

TIME TO BEG FOR A BOLT [RGBox bolt] one of the four.  AND/OR TIME TO LEARN TO
WORK ON MY BUS.

Took the bus to the good mechanic today.  He had the bolt and I arranged to
bring it in today.  It is way far from my house, and my job but all around the
shop are fast food places .. StarBucks etc .. So I brought a book, my iPod and
so on .. Drove up and told him that I would hang around [no matter how long it
took] until it was done.  Told him I will shop some, go to Starbucks and read
until they ask me to leave.  Go to McDonalds for lunch etc .. but he just kept
saying "bring it back when you can leave it for the day."  I said that was
what I was planning on, I would just be close by .. He said "no, bring it when
you can leave it."  What's up with that?  Besides, I want to see the work that
is being done on my bus from now on.  I don't mean sit on his lap or anything
.. but I don't want to just leave it and go.

Am I wrong ?? Am I being unreasonable ??

If not .. will someone please send me a bolt??
