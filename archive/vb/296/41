I live 50 miles from his shop.  Not many people would like to follow me
there, take to work, come back and get me and take me to the shop to pick
the bus up when it is ready. Oh yeah, and then drive 50 miles back home.  I
haven't asked anyone, but I would rather go to the dentist than spend that
much time on the road ..

coffee shop.  Of course, if you have a ways to go, and getting a ride can be
inconvenient, that makes the most sense for you
