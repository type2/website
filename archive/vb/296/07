While you are very unlikely to find another Dormobile (Christian Fig has the
only one I have ever seen) buses here are still cheap by US or European
standards. I recently sold a complete running though un-original  '57 standard
for the equivalent of $540.00. I reckon that you would end up with a pretty
good deal if you had a contact here to find, purchase and arrange shipping for
your bus.

I looked into exporting (buses and parts) to the UK a few years back and while
it looked like a good profit could be made two things stopped me. One; its a
lot of work to get all the legal stuff in place and two; I'd like a few buses
to be left in South Africa to flash my headlights at. Shades of the old 'buses
to Japan' thread of a few years back.....

We lost most interesting European sports machinery in the '80s (I haven't seen
a Healey outside of a car show in 10 years) when the US and UK classic car
markets went bananas and I beleive that the same is happening with now with
ACVWs. As an example Ghias used to be a common site on the roads and now they
are all but extinct.
