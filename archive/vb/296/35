Subject: Re: [VB] fuel sock in gas tank

I agree, without the sock the crud will clog up the fuel line.  you don't really want to have the bus choke to a stop,  have to pull the line off the filter,  nothing comes out, so have to blow through the line to clear it.

A trick I found for cruddy tanks is to take a magnet, sew it into a bad (like from an old T shirt sleeve) attach it to a coat hangar and push it down the tank filler neck, fold the end of the hanger over the filler opening so you can pull it out of the tank.

as the gas sloshes around the rust particles will stick to the magnet.   pull it out when you fill up w/ gas, and knock the crud off the magnet and put it back down the tank.  when it stops collecting crud hang it in the garage. 

 This really helped my 65 westy which had been sitting for years, meant the fuel filter didn't have to be changed every couple days.  tiny particles can get past the filter and crud up the carb and pump (I had taken the carb apart and cleaned it twice, and the pump once) So, the magnet saved me from doing that more.
