Subject: Re: Vent Wing Window Problem-- made easy

Just a nice steady bead of black silicon on the inside of the channel.  No
need to worry about the excess -- Close and lock the vent window until
dry--you can trim off the excess with a razor blade after it dries--I have
been doing them this way for over 20+ years  Never had one fall out--I like
the easy way--
 Let me know how it works ? I think you will be pleased.  Many times the
vent glass can break or you twist the frame--when trying to put in the
rubber.  This way there is no stress
