Subject: 67 bus running out of gas

Ok so after the turkey, after doing a crazy sound (plasma) system,a car show
(turkey rod run) a few hundred miles each way, i finnaly had a day to tear
into the 67 to see whey it was running out of gas on the highway and
fix that crappy rear main. 1 carb loose (well thats why it seems to start on
one carb but runs remarkably well around town, odd). Pull the motor, rear
fuel filter nasty (odd, i changed it maybe a few hundred miles ago). Pull 
the tank.
heres the fun part. I pulled out probably a coffee cup full (or more) of 
rust and
crap (crap = a bolt, 2 HUGE springs, and some plastic) from the tank. Pull 
out (and
broke) the screen, you could barely see through it or blow through it. 
(thank god the
guys house i was working out has a bus too and gave me his spare screen, he 
went
through the rusty tank syndrome too). Check my fuel sender (please let me be 
able
to fix this..please..). Its rusty too and only flakes fall out, no movement 
inside. Bah.
Shake, rattle and beat the tank to get as much crap as I can out, put it all 
back together.
Look at the motor, the rear main seal looks fine, clutch is oiled down rear 
of flywheel
is clean, housing is soaked. Changed it anyways and put some sealant over 
cam plug,
hopefully it will at least be managable. If i can source a fuel sender today 
i can yank the tank
back out and put it in, else, im fuel gauge less for a while more until I 
put the 1500 back in
and source the bay tank and its fuel sender. the joys of vw ownership..
