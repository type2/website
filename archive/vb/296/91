Hi Clara,
Best drum puller we used is the type that bolts into ALL FIVE lug bolts in 
the drum.  We helped our friend Bob dig out a 1965 Rivera Camper bus out of the 
East side of the Columbia Gorge where it had sat for years.  Took 11 hours of 
work by Eric and Bob to get it road worthy.  We could not get off one of the 
rear drums there, so loosened the axle nut a half turn to drive so the the drum 
could loosen.  After 500 miles it did not loosen at all so we rented this 
drum puller from the tool rental shop about a mile or two from you on Mud Bay 
Road.  Worked like a charm even though the drum stayed siezed ever mm as we 
pulled it off.  
  We used a drum puller once that only had three lugs holes and stripped the 
lug bolt hole of the one lug bolt off on its own on the other side of the drum 
from the other two lug bolts.  Drats!  
  Now about ten years later Bob still has the Rivera Camper and has it in the 
body shop to start restoring it to its former glory.
  We also miss NQ and many other past members of this list!!
