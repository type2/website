  Well I can vouch for the ability and importance of the fuel filter sock 
thing.
My gas tank was FULL of crap and gas flowed FREELY out of it even with the
sock filtering a bunch of crap at the same time (the sock was pretty cruddy 
too,
im talking worst case scenario). If your tank is at all questionable that 
sock is a
necesity id think. If I took it out id bet i couldnt keep filters in it 
longer than a
few miles. This tank is temporary until I get a later tank anyways. I moved 
the
filter to the engine bay so i can change it easier and ill keep it going a 
while
longer until I can get either a clean splitty tank or the proper (70ish?) 
bay tank.
Mine was bad enough that I wouldnt bother cleaning and sealing it although 
it
would probably last for a while. I havent taken it on the highway yet but I 
think
i solved the starving problem with the bad fuel filter being removed, 
cleaning the
tank and carbs, etc. I couldnt get to the FLAPs so no fuel gauge for me.
