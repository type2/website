Subject: RE: [VB] Oil leak at Oil Pump cover

Empi and a couple other companies make the oil filter pump, but I don't
recall any "O" ring, only the regular thin paper gasket. I have a few of
these pumps, most for the pre 71 cam without the deep dish, and none of
them had an "O" ring. Maybe an Empi only mod to the basic pump?

Hi Ray,

This pump is a VW heavy duty pump made by Empi with a cover that has a
screw on filter attachment. There is a single circular slot in the pump
body that faces the pump cover. I put an O-ring that came with the pump
of equal size into this slot then bolted the cover on. I think maybe I
should have also included a thin paper gasket, hence the source of the
leak.

Are you saying that the O-ring should not have been used here? These
engines are so cool. If they aren't put together right, they will
usually let you know.

Dave
