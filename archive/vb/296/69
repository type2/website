I think I am going to call WCM tomorrow and see if they have the smaller
rubber seal in stock. I am also going to look around town to see if any
of the auto glass shops have a thinner rubber seal.

WW doesn't do it anymore, they are a parts company now, not service
anymore. BFY does it but took over a month to get back  a set of vent
frames

Or, call up Wolfsburg West, and see if you can arrange to send them your
stuff and have them do it. They did it for me during my resto in 95, and
let me watch'em do it in the back!
