Subject: Re: [VB] Oil leak at Oil Pump cover

Hi Ray,

This pump is a VW heavy duty pump made by Empi with a cover that has a screw
on filter attachment. There is a single circular slot in the pump body that
faces the pump cover. I put an O-ring that came with the pump of equal size
into this slot then bolted the cover on. I think maybe I should have also
included a thin paper gasket, hence the source of the leak.

Are you saying that the O-ring should not have been used here? These engines
are so cool. If they aren't put together right, they will usually let you
know.
