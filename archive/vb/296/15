Subject: RE: [VB] pop out seal replacement

I just replaced all 6 pop out frames on my '66 Deluxe and while it was a
time consuming job, I am very pleased with the results.  I did not seem to
have any difficulties getting the inner frame to glass seal in and then
lining up the screw holes in the frame.  That being said, I was using 6 new
frames purchased from Wolfgang and rubber from WCM.  I was very impressed
with the craftsmanship and the fit on all the pieces. Just took my time and
I would say it was about a 1 hour job per frame, that includes getting the
glass out of the old rusty frames and cleaning it up, then installing rubber
and putting everything back on the Bus.  By the way, I tried a little trick,
I got a small brush and put POR 15 in the channels of my new frames, maybe
that'll help 'em last another 37 years!
