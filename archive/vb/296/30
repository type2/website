I feel compelled to put in a plug for this event for those who haven't
attended in the past.  London Bridge Bullis put on a first class event in
every way.  The new location (as of last year) is fantastic, the raffle
prizes are numerous and valuable, and the VW folks who attend are the
best! Put this one on your calender!
