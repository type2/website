Interesting the comments about the way mechanics treat
women.
Every VW shop we took our buses to were decent
mechanics but the guys who do all models, even older
ones that still use similar electrics & fuel systems
to VW, managed to stuff things up.
If I don't know something & I don't have the time or
the patience to look stupid asking questions about our
"new" vehicle I send my wife into the dealership with
the "helpless female" expression & they soon help her
out.
She isn't stupid.
The line "My husband hasn't told me how this works and
I'm worried if I break down I won't know what to do"
does the job.
I think there's a bit of posturing on both sides of
the fence and a fair bit of learned helplessness as
well.
But then I used to baulk at oil changes & I was male
the last time I looked ;o)
Cheers & God Bless
