Hi All,

I just received a message from Kris Heinicka in Florida...
He says "Mark Rafferty built the press in the factory book and
used it to press in the vent windows on my Kombi.  He
might be interested in a little side income pressing
in windows.  Email him at Neato64(-at-)aol.com"



now you know as much as me!
