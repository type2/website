Probably with a VW 737, "Tool for Installing and Removing Vent Wing Glass
Type 1, 2, 3".  Some assembly required - see the plans in the "Tools for
Local Manufacture" book at http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/ .

Another way is with a Black and Decker "Workmate" workbench.

Ronnie at Old Volks seems to know the story on these seals.
