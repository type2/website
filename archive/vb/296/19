Hi Jason,
First off when you refer to a rear seal we are pretty sure you mean the front 
of the engine FW seal.  Rear is toward the rear bumper and front is toward 
the front bumper!  Next just because the FW seal looks good does not mean it is. 
 First though you need to scratch and sniff the oil in the bottom of the 
tranny bell housing and sense if it has the tranny gear oil sulfur smell or if it 
smells like engine oil.  If tranny oil you need to replace the tranny input 
shaft and if engine oil you need to replace the FW seal and any O-ring or steel 
or paper gaskets between the forward end of the crank and the FW.  Check the 
area the FW seal contacts the FW for damage.  It is also a good idea to finely 
polish the bore the FW seal goes into with 400-600 grit Wet/Dry sandpaper.  On 
one engine we replaced the FW seal twice to finally figure the bore had a bit 
of corrosion in it preventing the seal from working properly there.  When we 
replaced it the third time in 3,000 miles and polished the bore it sealed up 
perfectly.
