Subject: RE: [VB] RE: Wing Window Rubber Problem!

	But is the rubber that comes in a bubble pack rolled up from WCM
the stuff I should be using. I thought here on the list serve there was
someone that had a different rubber solution? I will check the archives
to see if I can find something.
From the manual it sure looks like a lot of tooling that needs to be
done in order to get the glass in the frames.


Thanks again,
Eric

So how is the easiest way to put these frames together?
Hi Eric,
Pull out your Workshop Manual VW Transporter and go to section A-14,
pages 
12-14 for the best info.  For the blueprints to build the fixture shown
in that 
info go to:
