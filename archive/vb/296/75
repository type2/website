Subject: Re: [VB] Oil leak at Oil Pump cover

Hello Guys    There are about 4 different stlyes of these pumps. One of them 
takes a o ring under the cover plate. It would be wise to use a lite coat of 
sealant such as permatex super 300 or avation sealant on this o ring. the body 
of this pump takes the same gasket as the regular pump. seal this gasket also  
later and have fun  Mark Dearing  salem Import Service  Salem Va
