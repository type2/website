I think that you mean "bus generator" here and will go on that assumption.

Two ideas:

Find someone who has converted their bus generator to an alternator and
use their dished plate and the matching bus fan hub.  Sorry, mine is
already gone!  Be sure that you get the hub, as you won't be able to fit
the fan without it!

Or, buy an alternator stand and install an alternator.  It uses the bug
tin and fan hub that you already have.  Very easy to do if things are
already apart!
