I have heard that they all leak. That may become acceptable if after a
reasonable attempt it still drips. Meanwhile it is my mantra: fix the oil
leaks, fix the oil leaks, ....

> did you polarise  the generator?

Whoa... I forgot about that trick. How do you do that one?

> everything hooked up properly?

There are only two wires to the generator. I had them backwards at first.
Then I checked my other engine and reallized I had it wrong. So I switched
it. The light is still brightly lit. Maybe after having it hooked up wrong
it would require polarizing?

> brushes in good shape?

Brushes looks like they are pretty long. They don't look worn out and they
are in place. This generator did work less than two months ago fine.
