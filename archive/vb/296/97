Subject: Bug to Bus door handle convertion

Hi all. I recall hearing something about converting a bug pull type door 
handle to work on the type II, being an early 64 SC with the pull type. Untill I 
can locate a worthy used bus handle I would like to use the bug one in the 
meantime if possible. Is this a possibility?
