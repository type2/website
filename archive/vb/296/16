Subject: dove blue on newer USA or Import car?

First are all the Dove blues the same ?

this is for a 58 panel

then is there a modern car with the same color ?

I know the Dodge cargo Van that West Coast Metric uses is close but is there 
another factory color that is also close or the same

thanks
