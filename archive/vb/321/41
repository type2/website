Subject: trips report specs Oly to Bay Area, CA & back to Oly, WA

trip report for my 61 corner window deluxe (aka Red Bus) to BYOB/ KP and back 
to Oly, WA

2048 miles
82.4 gallons of gas consumed (87 octane, random gas stations)
24.8 mpg
.75 quarts oil added (turned out a couple of the 10mm nuts worked their way 
loose.. I blame them)

checked valves after trip.. no adjustment needed.  
timing/points out of spec after playing leapfrog w/ trucks on I-5 between 
Lake Shasta and Weed.
205 75 15 tires on stock 15" bus rims
4.375 r/p, .82 4th, 1.26 RGBs (early 64 gearing)
1600 sp w/ 7.6:1 CR, 28 pict carb, stock bus muffler.  
bus has roof rack
bus was pretty loaded going south, a bit more than average camping loaded 
going north.
usually drove 55-62 
oil temps between 170 and 200 (depending on hilliness, to 6% grade up or 
down; and outside temps, which ranged from below freezing to ~ 80F)

side doors are a bit more wonky, maybe I ought to check the wear on the check 
rods, & weld as needed.

light snow falling between Weed and Klamath Falls

here's a few pics of the trip:
