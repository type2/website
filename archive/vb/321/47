FAG has a catalog online but it doesn't seem to do cross references.  The
URL is hideous, so start at http://www.fag.de/NASApp/Access/index.jsp?lang=1 ,
click "products", then click "catalog".  For some reason, the site is
in English but the catalog is in German -- there are pictures.

You might be able to back into it using the Timken catalog, which does
has a cross reference, lookup by application, and application by part
number (it will show you all the cars that a particular part fits).

Hmm... the front inner wheel bearing for '64-'80 Bus is the same as
'60-'74 J-g--r XKE front inner and '88-'02 C-m-r- manual transmission...
