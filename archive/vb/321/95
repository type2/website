 I got a hospital phone call this morning, Sons on the phone pheww, he's ok
.He lost control of the '63 Bus going down a steep hill, he said he
downshifted to a lower gear and the rear end started slipping couldn't catch
it. Rolled over 2 times then nose first into a tree. He did have a seat belt
on. Grind marks on the handles bumper and corners lots of seams split open,
top raised a foot or so windows knocked out. interior cabinits demolshid..
The front drivres side nose pushed in... the parcel tray touching the seat
base the steering wheel a few inches from the back of the seat. knocked him
out for a while.! We're are going to keep parts for another Bus ..Time to
get out the sawzall.     Lloyd in Eureka, Calif
