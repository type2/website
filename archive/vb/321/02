Subject: Remove cooling fan continued

After gouging my shaft with vise grips, cursing, etc., I ended up taking the
fan and gen over to a firend with an air impact wrench.  It came off in about
2 seconds.  Sheesh.  Talk about having the right tools for the job .....  I
know we don't all have access to an air compressor, but this seems like one of
those situations where it might be worth giving the local garage $5 to hit it
with their wrench.  Of course as Clara noted, if this hadn't been over torqued
to begin with.....
One other option I thought about since my pully didn't have the flats was to
find another nut, tighten the two against each other and use that for
resistance against the 36mm.  Either way, no need to gouge your shaft during
this exercise.
Take care,
Mike
