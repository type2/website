Subject: VW Bus Dinnerware Set for Camping - Every Bus Owner Needs This!

This is a really cool new item that no one who camps in their VW Bus
should be without! I'm keeping two sets for myself, one for my Westy and
one for around the house when we cook out.

It's a complete dinnerware set - service for 4, plus 4 cups and a
3-piece serving set - in a VW Bus pattern. It's 'unbreakable' plastic,
perfect for camping. Available in a blue or multicolored pattern.  These
are coming on my container arriving around May 1. They may sell out
quickly, so order yours in advance.
