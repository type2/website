I haven't been following this thread closely, but this sounds a little 
like the time my flywheel gland nut came loose.  Can you affect the 
sound with the clutch pedal?  Worth a check before tearing it down.

(This happened to me on a road trip from North FL to North Carolina.  
Twice.  I got pretty good at pulling the engine by the side of the 
road.  When I got home I borrowed a jig from a local VW mechanic and 
drilled 4 new dowel holes in the crank, as the loose flywheel had 
caused the pins to wallow out their holes.  Never gave any trouble 
after that.)
