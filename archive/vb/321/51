Well somebody is going to poke holes in your electrical theory but it's not going to be me. I suggest you buy the inverter and put a load on it and drive around town and see if the electrical system will keep up. 

Secondly, they make standup a/c units that uses something like a dryer duct to exhaust the hot air. Might easy to hide in a cabinet. 

Thirdly - I would look for a traditional roof top a/c unit from an RV. Bet you can find one cheap if you look long enough. 

Good luck. Keep me updated. I'm curious how it works out.
