Subject: Re: stereo install under dash

thanks for all the responses. i ended up getting a single din holder from 
BestBuy for $16.99 and it made the install a breeze. the PO of my SO-44 
westy ripped the doors off the left and right sides of the rear 
"head-banger" cabinet and it seemed like a natural place for some 6x9's. for 
those thinking of doing this, my head unit came with a IR remote which is 
nice because its quite a stretch to the radio.
