it has been very crudley cut out down to the loading bay level.  it then has 
as small step through the cab seats, it looks from the pics that the bit 
below the middle of were the bench would be has also been cut away.  to 
effectively make a walkthrough as the bench has been replaced with two 
single seats.

andy - surely the seat mount humps are the wheel arches.  or am i missing 
something (i am new to this). good point about the spare though.

i realise they did make a walkthrough at the time, but did these have extra 
support to compensate for the lack of stiffness provided by the bulhead, and 
where did they keep the spare?
