Hi Mike,
1967 "H" cases had the 1500cc with 83mm P&Cs, later came out in the "B" 
engine cases the 1600 with 85.5mm P&Cs, both with 69mm stroke carnkshaft.  Much 
later aftermarket came out with 1641cc with 87mm P&Cs that will slip in a stock 
1500/1600 case without machining, but the cylinders are very thin and will warp 
if floored and ignored!
  If your engine needs new P&Cs you are more than likely much better off to 
rebuild the entire engine and avoid having tired old worn out main and rod 
bearings give out soon after because of the sudden HP increase with better selling 
higher CR new P&Cs!  We have seen too many other volks go that way only to 
all too soon rebuild the entire engine, and have to throw away the only recently 
P&Cs due to being worn in already!  While you are in there get a cast SCAT CW 
crank!!  CW crank creates a much smoother engine that lasts longer and 
driving the bus is less fatiguing during longer trips from not being shook and noise 
so much.
