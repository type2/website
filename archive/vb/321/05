Hello Guys   When I fixed Kristian Laurites Motor 2 days before she was 
murdered The flywheel stayed in the bellhousing when I removed the motor from the 
bus. I was able to repair this by grinding the end of the crank flat, 
redrilling the crank at 90 degrees difference from stock and using another flywheel .I 
made a special gland nut with cut outs on the flats of it so that I can use 
the flywheel as a guide for drilling the dowells.  It was a good thing that I 
had the proper tap for the crank also to clean the treads up. Later and have fun
