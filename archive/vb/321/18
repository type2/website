Subject: Oil pressure gauge readings...

Good morning Y'all,
Yesterday I completed the install of a VDO oil
pressure gauge in my 71 westy, 1600 DP.  I am just
curious as to what I should consider "normal" PSI
readings on the gauge.  On  my way to work this
morning I got a reading of just over 20 PSI at idle
and then at 55MPH I got a reading of just over 40 PSI.
 Its all backroads to work and it was a cool morning,
so oil temps stayed about 180 degrees with the
previously mentioned pressure readings.
Anyway, what reading is considered "too low" what
reading is considered "too high".  
Just curious about what I should expect the gauge to say.
