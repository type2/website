Subject: Muffler part ID

I purchased a muffler from the FLAPS a while back to go on a 1600 bus
engine.  The project got delayed and since then I have lost the receipt.
Anyway..  I went to hook it up Sunday and the connections don't line up.
Looks like it goes on a smaller engine.  Can anyone id this part number?

211-251-053F-J  Made in W Germany.

I Just want to know if I have the correct part (just bent wrong) or the
wrong one altogether...
Thanks in advance.
