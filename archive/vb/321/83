Dave,

Yeah, I checked the rocker assys several months ago, as it seemed that
they were noisy, but they seemed tight, no missing rings or springs. I'm
thinking that some of the sound is a possible exhaust leak at one
particular gasket, though I replaced it only in October, and there's
hardly any miles on it. Hopefully this next weekend I can get some time to
pull the engine and play.
