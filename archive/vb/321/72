We think that if you really want AC you would be much better off finding a
wrecked new automobile with AC and figure out how to install it in the bus.

Thanks for your input, I think you have a very valid opion, I do have all
the parts needed to add a stock system to the bus, but really thought this
other method if it works might have some advantages.  Here are a couple
advantages I was thinking about.

1.  I would like to have the ac unit anyway for those hot campouts where we
have power hookups, so I was planning on buying one anyway.

2.  Adding dual alternators, extra battery and inverter will be much easier
than putting in the compressor, evaporator, dryer, condenser, blowers,
electrical and all the plumbing.

3.  The conversion from road ac to camping ac will be seamless, just hook up
to the power, then shut down the engine.

I know some of you are saying what a softy, you don't need ac to camp, but
if you've never camped in wet sheets from sweat, or listened to a young one
cry half the night because their too hot, you just can't imagine how much
fun it takes away from camping.
