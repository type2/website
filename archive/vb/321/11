Subject: Found a '60 Panel

On the way home from the VW show I found a rusting '60 panel in a 
field. I've driven by it literally 100's of times, but for some 
reason never spotted it. It's tucked away pretty good I guess. Not on 
the beaten path.

Well we saw it today and I made my way out into the field to check it 
out. Unfortunatly it's rusted to hell and there isn't much anything 
left on it. No emblem or lights or handles. Broken glass ect. Cab 
doors rusted out at the bottom. One good cargo door, the other is 
trash. There are a set of bumpers inside of it worth grabbing. An 
engine lid too. Steering wheel and horn are there and are probably 
worth getting. This thing is really trashed. The cargo floor was 
crumbling as I made my way around inside it.

Dumb me forgot to take pictures. I can't decided if I should go try 
and find the owner to see if they'll let me load what's left to bring 
home and scavenge...or if I should just grab what I can from where it 
is. Like I said, not much left. I don't really need anything, but 
hate to see what's left just sit there rotting away.

I'll try and get pictures of it next time I'm that way. Should be in 
the next few weeks. Maybe I'll get lucky and find the owner...who 
will have OTHER vw stuff tucked away somewhere else.....

...to be continued....
