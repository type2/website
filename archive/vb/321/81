Well, I ran the engine without the fan belt, and the sound is still there.
But other rattles and tinny sounds went away, but that's to be expected.
The sound has changed a bit from last weekend. No longer sounding like a
ratlle-can ball, but now more of a whistle, at the lower 2000's. Strange.
I went under there, and checked the exhaust fittings while it was on
briefly, and one seems to be leaky, so hopefully this next weekend, I can
schedule time to pull the ol' engine and pull off the exhaust stuff, and
check all gaskets. Also would like to get the rear end up on blocks and
check rear bearing play, and tranny main shaft bearing play. Your basic
end of winter engine TLC day. Endplay, etc. All the good stuff. Maybe even
yet another valve check - easier outside the bus.

Stay tuned, and thanks for all the responses and ideas!
