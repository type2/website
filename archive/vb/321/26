Subject: Looking for a back-up regulator and distributor...

One more thing...

I'm looking for a NOS, or a good working used 6 volt voltage regulator for a
back-up spare to stash away in my '59 Panel.

The part number I'm looking for is #113 903 801E, and it would be correct
riding on my LJ/REG 180/6/2500 L 3 generator with a 90 mm diameter.

While you're looking, I'm also hoping to find a good used, complete vacuum
advance distributor, VW part number #131 905 205 or Bosch # 0 231 137 011.
Thanks for checking your parts piles!
