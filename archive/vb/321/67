Hi-

I am searching for the interior metal trim piece with hooks for my Westy 
poptop in my '67.  This goes between the wood headliner and the poptop 
opening.  It has the hooks attached for the poptop rubber pieces to 
attach to so the poptop doesn't pop up during driving.  Anyone know if 
this piece is made by someone?  Any help is appreciated....
