you don't even need to go that far (tho it helps) - you can take off 
the heads and GENTLY rotate the motor so the cyl in question is at 
BDC; this puts the crank journal against the far side of the bearing. 
then push in on the center of the piston. a bad rod bearing will make 
a definite 'tonk' against your finger as the ovalled bearing moves 
travels to the near side of the journal. my friend says he can do it 
this way cuz usually, if the rod is going, the rings are worn enough 
to not offer much resistance to the finger push, but i found i always 
need to get the piston off the rod to really feel the movement for 
sure........
