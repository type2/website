Hi Cal,
That does not sound good!  Though usually if it is a rod bearing going bad it 
only knocks when the engine is RPMing down.  
  Reminds us of the time Eric heard a type 3 KG in line to the Vintage show 
up here idling noisily.  Eric warned them about how thier engine sounded and 
told them to shut it down and tune it up after the show, and if the noise did 
not go away they should be ready for a new engine!  Turned out the next day that 
the type 3 KG threw a rod and they had to be towed back home in Canada many, 
many miles from the Seattle area.
  Cal, we would suggest the same, tune it up and if the noise is not gone 
after that, it is time to autopsy the engine.  We know that doing a autopsy is 
not what you are looking forward to doing, but if you do it instead of waiting 
for whatever to give in there, you will save alot of $$$ in damage.
