It's not geometry, it's physics - simple reality. In particular, it's
the mechanics of rigid bodies. Force at a distance. Torque is the result
of applying a rotational force. This force is normally applied at a
specific distance from the center of rotation, and the torque, measured in
foot-pounds in this case, is simply equal to the magnitude of the force
multiplied by the 'moment arm', or the distance from the center of
rotation to which it's applied.

The homework problems are due next week.
