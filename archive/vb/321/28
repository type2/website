******sorry apparently the fact that our computers are using competing 
software
is blocking my access to the site...I can get to the log in page but it
won't allow me to log in unless I give information that I am not permitted
to give out on this computer, we need to find an open site that allows
anyone to access it.******


Sorry about that I figured something like that would happen. But I too have 
another possibility but I will not be able to get to until this evening 
while I am cleaning my engine parts with my new HydoSeal Parts Washer(Oh 
yeah baby this s#(-at-)t works like a charm.) Thanks for the tip Terry.

Thanks,
