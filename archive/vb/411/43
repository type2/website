I talked to the a/c guy if i remember correctly he was restoring 
splitties and had a complete bolt on a/c kit. I think he was 
considering retiring. he is near tampa.
Remember that with the bus there is a lot of room in the engine bay. So 
depending on how handy a person is you can possibly fit your own from a 
car or other kit. I noticed that the bugs with a/c have several metal 
mounts that are bent and twisted to fit every thing under the hood. 
They look good but busses i think may need much easier mounting. 
Gilmore that is the guy I remember he sent me several pages of the 
installation. pictures were a little difficult as they were photo 
copies. somewhere around 100 to $1200 for the system and I dont think 
that included install.  There is an all electric splittie around tampa 
.It was featured on the cover of hot vw or the other one. He was at the 
vws over the skyway in 04 I think.
He told me he had a/c aboard, mounted between the seats--of an all 
electric bus amazing. He admitted spending big bucks, but it was his 
hobby. I think Gilmore may have a shaped under dash panel for his a/c 
kit.

so any way see what turns up. In florida you die without A/C. actually 
you might die without disc brakes too- but they are not hard to find- 
just the money
