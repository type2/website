Hi Bob,
You are going to need to just rebuild the motor and personally would ditch  
the engine case.  Over heating causes the engine case to soften and the  head 
studs pull out the threads in the case.  
 
  At the very least if the engine is not locked up and you need  to get it 
running for now.  You need to strip the engine down to a long  block and 
retorque ALL the engine case and head fasteners in same order as  building an engine.
  To fix the spark plug holes you should use a solid insert from  Time-Sert.  
These inserts lock in place.  All other fixes have a good  chance of later 
coming out with the spark plugs due to no way to lock  them.
E&B
