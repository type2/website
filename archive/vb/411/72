I'm with Greg and Don. I much prefer the list to web forums. Friends
here, and less volume to wade through... There are a few generous
offers here. I'm sure one of them will work out if a web-based service
isn't chosen.

 I am a member of several other lists, and most of them are hosted by Yahoo
 or Google.

 For free.

 If we can find a host to unload the archives and library onto, there's
 really no reason why this list couldn't continue to operate as a yahoo
 group.

 I would have to vote against shutting the list down. Traffic may be
 low, but the people are still here.

 Hardware is easily replaced. If the hardware was magically replaced
 with a virtual, the co-lo cost should go down too.

 Let me take some of those usage numbers to some friends with rack
 space here and see what I can do.

 I don't want to lose this list!
