I've never seen them look for an engine number.  Most engine numbers are
pretty well buried.

Looking at Vehicle Code 4150, engine numbers aren't even mentioned except
in the case of motorcycles, which are mentioned separately in the CVC.  If
you don't need it to initially register the vehicle, you don't need it at
all.

Secion 4161 seems to require that engine changes be registered, but
Section 4163 leaves a huge loophole.  All you have to do is have three
vehicles registered with DMV and you're off the hook for section 4161, at
least until you sell the vehicle.  Note that they don't say that the
vehicles have to be the same, so the three ORV registrations I maintain
keep me legal.
