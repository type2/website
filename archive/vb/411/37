Subject: RE: converting a gas heater from 6V to 12V

Hi Matt,

Thanks for the detailed description. I realized the other day, that I had
accidentally turned the heater on-and I'm not sure when. I don't know if it
ever actually kicked on, as it was turned down real low.

I hope to take your notes out to the bus in the next week or two, to review
them, along with the original documents and wiring diagram. I'm trying to
find that diagram right now, I know it is in a box with a bunch of my VW
books-somewhere in  my house.

Again-thanks...

Oh yeah, it is a stewart warner heater.
