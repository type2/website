A couple of quick thoughts from me and others...

 From Jim at Bostig...amazing isn't it, this
is of course the *only* way Bobby Donalds would ever let either of us
make all this fuss over him.

I personally donated what I would have spent on airfare to go back to
Boston..and low and behold, I got an offer of a ticket back there...Now
thats a community of caring folks.
We need to take care of our own any way we can and this is a real and  
caring
way to get that done. Step up folks and lets do it now, so we can  
look back
and say.." Yeah, I knew B Bob, and he gave me advice selflessly one  
day when
I had a problem...good guy. I need to help with some payback for that.

  Well, that hit me like a  ton of bricks this morning.  Sure makes you
understand how fragile life  really is... From Frank

I've tried a dozen times to come up with a fitting post to send to
  'lists', but keep tearing them up...Speechless...from Jim A. (and  
that says
something...)

Bob, I found you to be the most informed, least presumptive human
being who ever earned the title of champion waterboxer guru. You were
a joy to deal with....from Jim F.

Godspeed, Bob.  You made the world a better place ...from Tabe

May God look with mercy on him and grant him rest from his labors,
and eternal memory...David B
