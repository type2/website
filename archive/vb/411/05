In Washingtoin it is technically iligeal to not have a number on your block, I
work for the Health Department and one of my jobs has included working with
the Washingtron State Patrol indentifying and removing "Junk Vehicals" I
specifically asked this question {as I had an unstamped block myself} and was
told that yes you are suspose to. He then went on to explain that on a vehical
as old as mine no one would question a motor with the wrong stampings just as
long as it had stampings.
