Subject: Buses By the Beach - Bus Cook Book is out!

"Cooking It Up in My VW Bus" by Jen Olson is now for sale.
http://www.lulu.com/content/2437343

The long awaited Buses By the Beach Cookbook is done and for sale on
lulu.com. Proceeds from this cook book will be donated to the Phoenix
Society for Burn Survivors. 

My wife Jen has been compiling recipes for this cookbook for over the past
three years. Thank you to everyone for their contribution of recipes
including people on the VW Van related lists, folks we met at music festival
parking lots and attendees of Buses By the Beach events. If you gave my wife
a recipe it is printed in the book and you can now say that your recipe has
been "published!" :-) 

The cookbook has 116 recipes and tons of great color photos of fellow bus
pilots doing what they do when they camp and eat in their favorite vehicle.
If you have ever been to a Buses By the Beach event there is a good chance
your picture will be in the book. When you sleep, eat, cook, hangout, camp,
and drive in a small vehicle, you need to have recipes that are easy to make
while camping or prepared before the trip. My wife loves to cook and always
asked VW campers what they were cooking and eating in their bus. She decided
to put this passion into a fundraising VW cookbook.

If you would like to preview the first 16 pages of the cookbook or purchase
it for $29.99 (or download it for $10.00) you can go to lulu.com and type in
VW cooking or click on the following link.
