Subject: Flash:  green Type II in NY Times....

There was an interesting drawing of a green (as in environmentally
friendly) Type II Westy concept car in the online version of the NY
Times today:

The picture accompanies an article on green RVs:

Apparently the guy who designed it is working on having it manufactured
(for a projected selling price of $129k).

Cheers,
Rusty
67 Westy (pearl white, not green)
