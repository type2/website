Subject: Drop gate for my 66 CC

Anyone, know where I can find a rear drop gate for my 66 CC?  NOS would
be the preferred choice if possible but realize I am prob dreaming. I
need a straight one. I tried to post on www.dropgates.com
<http://www.dropgates.com/>  but their "forum" link is down.



Thanks much
