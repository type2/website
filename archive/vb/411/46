Some random ideas...

Is this an inductive pickup timing light?  If so, maybe it's having
trouble picking up.  You might try the pickup at different places on the
#1 spark plug wire to see if that makes a difference.  You might even
swap #1 and #2 wires (at both ends) to see if maybe the #1 wire is
flaky.  If #1 spark plug is crudded up, this could also affect how it
fires.

It seems like most of the complaints about 34 PICT 3 carbs and
distributors involve driveability, not just sitting there idling.  You
don't even *have* to hook up the vacuum advance for a test if you don't
want to.  If you have a hand vacuum pump, you can use that to adjust the
advance on the distributor, independent of what the carb is doing.
