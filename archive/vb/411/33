Subject: Found Another Local Bus Nut

For months now I have been drooling over 3 splitties that are stored a block
from my house.  They are stored in a warehouse that is some kind of plumbing
business.  My neighborhood is definitely NOT known for having old buses,
especially none as nice as these!  I finally ran into the owner today,
Buddy.  He was very cool and invited me to check them out, even with my 4
mini Dachshunds in tow (on a walk).  He says that I should check out the 59
SO-23.

The first one I noticed a couple of months ago was a 2-tone green standard
that looked to have OG paint.  I'd have been perfectly happy to 'suffer'
with that one.  Ever since I saw that van, I've always made that the
direction of my walks with the dogs!

The 23-window sticks out a bit ('59?).  It is a show quality Micro that's
done in my favorite ceiling wax red and chestnut brown combo.  The paint is
just sick!  Completely restored to stock, except for the engine and trans.
The only sign is the A-1 muffler header setup.

There is also a 59 Crew Cab that is just ridiculous!  A complete restoration
that looks better than I've seen in quite some time.  This one was also done
up stock, except for the motor, trans, and the A-1 muffler.

I finally get to the SO-23 (I think '59 too), which is just amazing.  All
original, including all the bits inside. . .even the burlap type floor
cover.  He mentioned that it was found in Argentina and thinks it might be
the most southern delivered splittie found.  It has the license plate from
Tierra Del Fuego, an island on the tip of South America, he said.

I asked him if he was going to OCTO.  He was pulling them out to wipe them
down and make sure they're ready for the drive down.  Then he tells me that
he wished I'd met him earlier 'cuz I could've driven one of them down!!

Now I'm home smacking my head against the wall!  I'm struggling to get the
crew cab back together for tomorrow, but I don't think I'll make it.  I
guess I'll have to take the Syncro instead ;(  Could be worse I guess, at
least it's a Type II !

All the standard disclaimers apply.  I have no affiliation, yada, yada,
yada.  These guys just do some super high quality work (from the looks of
the buses I saw).
