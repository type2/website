I guess it depends on how bad it overheated.. but if the heads were good
when the plugs blew.. and weren't already just about to go.. then it
overheated enough to tear into it and diagnose every part to ensure the
integrity.. at the same time .... repair the spark plug holes in all 4... at
the very least.. lap in the valves, and replace any worn parts..  clutch..
... and have another 5-10 years of farfurnugen
