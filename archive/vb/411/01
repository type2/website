Subject: Wind wing

Colleagues,

Brutus Kong busted my front passenger wind wing handle.  I am in need of a
replacement.  I have an extra one, but wouldn't you know, it is for the
passenger side.  I could use it, but that means the wind wing handle action
would turn back and downward  toward the seat, not good as it angles into the
door.  Anyone have a passenger side wind wing handle  available or know where
I can get one?

Aaargh, Brutus also busted my outside passenger double doorlocking blade
handle, but I was able to replace that one, thankfully.  I don't let my boyz
drive my bus anymore without me!  ;-(

I've actually got two front doors, driver and passenger, sans handles, in fair
shape if anyone needs them.  By fair shape I mean nothing but surface rust,
and that is only on the sliding window area, a small ding in one just below
the wind wing, easily repairable, and lots of paint applied by a paint brush.
Well, at least it was applied so thick that it preveneds rust.  I think they
are off an earlier bus as one of them has a blade door handle.  Oh, and the
passenger door will be sans a wind wing as when Brutus did his dirty work he
busted off the nob that the wind wing handle rotates on.

I hope somebody can help me out!

PLV,

Curt
