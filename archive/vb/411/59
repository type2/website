Hi David,

I'd be happy to take over the lists/site and/or donate any servers or
storage you need to run it. I've been doing this sort of thing for a
while so it wouldn't be too much overhead for me.

I've got a boatload of ibm xseries (1u servers) and dell poweredge (1u
servers) that we can use. They are all p4 2.4Ghz or better CPU with a
minimum of 2GB RAM. I think the smallest onboard disk is 73GB and most
have a minimum of 2 disks.

Let me know how I can help, if you want me to take over the site perhaps
we can get it done this weekend.

Cheers,
Harry
