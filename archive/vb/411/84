I wonder if a fund drive would bring the money in. There seems to be a lot
of desire to keep the list going.  Maybe we need to identify the most
cost-effective method of doing so, and get a feel for about how much each
active member would have to put in in order to make it happen. This would
give us an idea of whether the necessary funds could realistically be
raised.  

I threw this offer out in the past and it was declined, but I'll offer it
again: It would take me literally minutes to create part number LISTDONATION
on busdepot.com, so people could easily donate to the list with a major
credit card simply by putting it in their shopping cart (with no obligation
to buy anything from the Bus Depot).  It is a little easier than Paypal,
since no Paypal account is required and you can use your credit card.  But
also, going forward, it could also be a source of continuing revenue for the
list. If everyone who ordered a part for their Bus also threw in a few bucks
to support the list, that could add up. For example, Type 2 and VintageBus
list members get a 5% discount on most Bus Depot orders. Since they have
their list membership to thank for that discount, if they donated just half
of the savings to the list and pocketed the other half, the revenue to the
list would be significant.  From my end, I would absorb the credit card
processing fees and forward 100% of the donations to the list. Having been a
list member since the list's inception, and had many customers who were list
members, it's the least I could do.
