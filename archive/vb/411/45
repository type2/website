Ensure that the spring is installed on the top of the distributor
drive pinion.  If it's missing or lost it's spring tension, that will
cause the pinion to rise and fall a millimeter or so as the engine is
running resulting in timing that is all over the place.  If that is in
place, then I would suspect the dizzys; especially the Chinese 009.
Check that the point plate is greased so that it moves freely when the
weights move it and also ensure the weight pivots are lubed.  If
things are dry it will move erratically. of course also check the
shaft for axial play; if it wobbles a lot it's toast.
