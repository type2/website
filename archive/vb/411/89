I'm sorry I can't be of technical help but I've always been willing to  
donate and will continue to do so if it gets worked out.

Absolutely.   That's why I haven't asked for donations at this time.

Without  volunteers to run things, there won't be anything that  needs
donations.

A small handful of people have offered their  technical assistance, and
I've tossed them in a room.  We'll see what  they come up with.

If I missed anyone who is volunteering technical  help, let me know.


If the worst happens, and no one (or no plan)  comes together to run
things, I want to drain the bank paying the last of  the bills.   We have
right around enough to finish things up  right now, so we'll be even.  If
it costs less than we have, we'll  refund going backwards (last donation
goes back first).  If it costs  more than we have, the admins will be
covering  it.
