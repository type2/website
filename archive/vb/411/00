Subject: Re: [VB] weird backfire question

you said the engine wasn't running.. so there may be a fuel delivery
problem...
and it is impossible for a fuel line to be effected by a manifold backfire..
I take it it was thru the carb . not in the exhaust backfire...

that line carries fuel.. therefore it must smell like fuel..

sorry I can't help you.
