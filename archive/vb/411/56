Folks,

An update on the fund-raising efforts for the "Boston Bob Fund".

For those that missed the kick-off to this PiFF (Pay it Forward)
Project please read this,

http://tinyurl.com/5lm4af

Yesterday morning I posted that, to date, we had 44 contributors
donating a total of  $5812.00

I went on to say, "Wouldn't it be something if we could average a $5-
$10 donation from every single member of every VW group, forum or club.

Yeah I know ... probably not realistic ... but we can dream, can't we?"

Friend and list member Phil Zimmerman replied "Dream big and never
stop!"

Well damn ... Phil may be right.

We now have 90 contributors donating a total of $8407.00

It seems we have a shot at raising $10,000 for Karen & the Donalds
family.

Wouldn't that be incredible?

Something is happening here that we should all be very proud of--
community helping community at its best.

The donation period for the "Boston Bob Fund" will continue through
Sunday 11/2.

Maggie Dew and I are donating all PayPal fees so that 100% of every
donation goes directly to the Donalds family.

Please help if you can.  Every donation of any amount  is greatly
appreciated.

Donations can be made via PayPal or Charge Cards thru the Roadhaus.com
