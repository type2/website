Subject: Boston Bob...

What a bummer to hear of our loss of "Boston Bob"!  Although I never had the
privilege to have met the man, he was a legend in our VW hobby,  I always
secretly hoped that someday I might own one of his meticulously built
engines for something in my fleet.

May he rest in peace, racing VWs around the perimeter of heaven...
