Subject: A/C in Splits...

With all this conversations about putting Air Conditioning in a early bus, I
realized I have a few NOS A/C components stashed away somewhere in the
basement.  So if anyone out there is contemplating the installation, I might
have a few NOS items available for sale that will help out.

I'm not too saavy in A/C terminology, so I don't know what they are called.
Both are NOS (never used) units for VW factory A/C systems.  I have good
photos if needed.  I'll try to describe them.

One is the large flat unit that bolts to the frame rails on the underside of
the Type 2.  It is is like a radiator or condensor thru which your refrigerant
is cooled through multiple passes thru the finned unit.  It is encased in
black sheet metal, has two 12 volt electric fan units to assist in the colling
process and both it's intake and outlet pipes/fittings are still capped off
from the factory.

The other unit is also a condensor of some sort, a smaller finned unit through
which the refridgerant line makes many passes through to cool down the
refridgerant.  It's much smaller than the other and doesn't have the fan units
(wasn't supposed too).

Again these aren't used, beat-up units of unknown condition stripped from some
junkyard Type 2. Both A/C units are NOS, are collecting dust in my basement,
and would be nice additions to the system someone out there may be cobbling up
for their early Type 2.  If you're interested in them, just let me know and
I'll try to answer any questions and send photos.  I'd consider most
reasonable, fair offers.  I'll have to box 'em up pretty well to protect them
for shipping too.

Hopefully they'll help someone out there in a hot, steamy climate to enjoy
their Bus a bit more, I doubt that I'll ever use 'em...
