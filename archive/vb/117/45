I was also under the impression that SK was for special kolour- i assume =
the postioning of the tag under the seat has to do with the bulkhead =
missing as per the norm with an so34/35

i don't believe that "SK" means sikkens paint. i=20
think it is a german abbreviation for special color combination, for 2 =
main=20
reasons. first, every bus i have seen that has "SK" has been painted from =
the=20
factory uniquely in some way that is different from the "normal" way =
they=20
painted a bus. example: my 61 flipseat (and jp's) everything, including =
the=20
interior, was the lower body color, and only the OUTSIDE above the =
beltline was=20
white. this is in contrast to say a standard that would be say blue/white, =
where=20
the interior would be white.

second: can you imagine the factory having to=20
change the paint in the spray booths every single time an "SK" bus came=20
through?

i have an original flipseat paint color brochure=20
which specifies the "SK" combinations/number designations for those=20
particular busses. SK 1023 is specified as (body color)turquoise/(roof =
color)=20
blue white.

=20

=20

 Another thing. I looked at Everetts site for the colors=20
and at the pics of


the bus again and it appears that the color code SK 1023 is white upper=20
with

a sky blue? lower. This was determined by the inside of the engine lid=20
and

doors. Has anyone ever seen this combination before and are Sikkens=20
pait

colors all special order?=20
