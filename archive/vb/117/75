Subject: Vac Dizzy Q

Hi,

I have in my hand a VW 113-905-205T dizzy that came with my old 69 
bus and it is the correct and original dizzy from that bus (1600 SP 
non-doghouse.)  It gave 150,000 happy miles before it was forsaken 
for a 009 during a roadside repair about a year ago. The bus would 
occasionally hesitate as though it was not getting any spark for just 
a second. That bus and motor are long gone but I still have the dizzy 
and wonder if anything is really wrong with it.

The vac can seems good and the plate advances. There is no side to 
side play in the shaft but there is a little up and down movement on 
the shaft and I am not sure if that is normal.

I am determined to go back to a vacuum advance dizzy and wonder how 
to tell if this one is really worn or not. I considered getting a 
SVDA from aircooled.net but the page says the dizzy they offer only 
works with 34pict carbs and I have an H30/31 on my SP1600 doghouse 
motor.

The 205T seems to be a pure vac advance dizzy and it would seem easy 
to pull it apart and clean it up. Any thoughts or warnings on doing 
this? Anyone know of a source for rebuilt vac advance distributors 
that work with 30 series carbs? Anyone rebuild carbs?




Thanks
