Nope, the logic isn't good. There's no logical reason why they would have used an abbreviation that isn't based on any words in their language, or even the language of the country the bus is being shipped to. "Kolor" isn't a word in German *or* English. That's what I was trying to point out in my post yesterday. I'll be surprised if we ever know what SK stands for, but I think we can pretty much rule out "Special Kolor". It just doesn't make any sense that they would make up a word like that.

Konfiguration, as suggested by John Kyte yesterday, is at least a logical possibility.

Maybe SK is for Sillythread Killit. 8^)

It's still a Kombi, but in this case it is the typical single color.  If the M-code plate still has the SK identifier in front of the color code, then one could assume SK refers to Sikkens paint.  If there is no SK identifier, then one could assume that it does in fact stand for Special Kolor, as in the case of a Dove Blue Westy (Kombi) it isn't a "special color" and the SK is not there to represent that.  Good logic???
