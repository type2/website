yes, but it isn't a standard, it's a kombi.  maybe that's a mute point.  the only other thing i thought is that earlier buses, say pre '62ish, had a front cabin painted the lower body color.  it wasn't unitl sometime in the early '60's that they went to the upper color.  i could be completely wrong.
