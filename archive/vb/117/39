You can check for spark without all the turning of the engine.  Though if you 
have a helper just turn it over for you is the easiest way to do it.  You can 
also turn the engine till it is at TDC #1 cylinder and check to make sure the 
points are closed.  Remove the #1 sparkplug and make sure it is against 
something to ground it.  Turn on the ignition switch to power and remove the 
wire from the distributor that goes to the condensor on the distributor and 
you should get a spark at the plug!
  If you have spark then you need to figure out if you have fuel.  Often it 
is a good idea to pour about a tablespoon down the carb to get the engine 
going.
  As for your fan belt problem we have no idea which lower, let alone which 
upper pulley or even if they are stock that you are using.  Hopefully at 
least you are using the 2:1 lower pulley which almost always has a "D" about 
3/8" tall stamped on one of the pie shaped coragations of the pulley.

Do you have one of those darned repair clamped on to the cable battery 
terminal?  If so either get a new battery cable with clamp on it or solder a 
brass clamp onto your old cable.  Otherwise take the repair clamp off the 
cable and brush clean the clamp and cable areas where they connect and repeat 
this cleaning two or three times a year.  Also for any battery clamp it 
really helps to cut down on corrosion by soaking these battery clamps in a 
baking soda water solution to nuetralize all acid that has soaked into them.

Best you try to do as much as you can.  It will save you $$ in the long run 
and better yet give you experience so you can do repairs yourself in the 
future!  So break out the Idiots manual by John Muir which is quite hepfull 
for the begginer VW owner, & have the bus shop manual from Bentley for all 
the tech info you will need.
