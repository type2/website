Thx. for the reply,
But I need to clarify...what's the "slightly off p and/or cs refer to?"
I may have this problem- since I don't know what it is!
Unfortunately I haven't checked the compression ratio.  I guess that should
have been done before re-installing the engine.

What should they be at?

again, thx for your time,

  Jeremy
