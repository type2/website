There are two types of bolts used to hold the pan on... self tapping and
normal machine threads.  I believe they are a 10mm head and do not have any
markings on them because the head of the bolt has a little rim around the
edge.  The parts manual lists them as a 6.3mm self tapping hex bolt with a
washer but I know some of the ones on the double cab are threaded into the
frame using a normal tap.  If you look at the holes in your frame, you can
tell what goes where.  Since the pedal pan has yet to be fitted onto the 59
double cab, I haven't explored placement yet and the tipper's pan was only
held on with 4 of the bolts :-O
