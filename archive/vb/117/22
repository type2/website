As a new owner of a '68 Ghia vert I need to know where there is good, =
reliable info about this strange little car. Is there a list like this?

If there is a list like this I will probably have to get a new mailbox. =
With this list and my Oregon Ducks list I get about 80 E-mails a day.

As cute as it is, and as much as my wife loves it, it will never come =
close, in my eyes, to my '63 Bus.
