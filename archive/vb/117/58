My next new car (actually to replace my wife's beetle which is headed for
restoration) will probably be a Honda.  It certainly will not be a VW.
Honda currently occupies the same place in the automotive heirarchy that
VW did in the aircooled era, with decent reliable cars.  VW went away from
that except in exterior shapes.  The question is, how long will nostalgia
sell cars for VW?
