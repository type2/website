The original type was a "G 6 V 10 W" per DIN 72601.  12 V bulbs
with the same base and glass include...

No.     V      W
   67  13.5   8.0
   89  13.0   7.5
   97  13.5   9.3
   98  13.0   8.1
  631  14.0   8.8
 1155  13.5   8.0
17311  12.0  10.0

The last one, 17311, may be specific to Wagner brand bulbs.  GE has 
an "international series" of bulbs, and the bulb you want may be
sold as simply "12 V 10 W".  Any of these will work; it depends on
how close to original brightness you want to be.
