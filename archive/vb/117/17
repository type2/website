The liscense plate light is the same as the little running lights in the 
headlight buckets- they are smaller bulb size but same base size compared to 
the front turn signal bulbs, and have the one filament only.   The reverse 
light bulbs are the same as the front turn signal bulbs- one filament.   One 
filament bulbs have the holder into the socket ears symmetrically placed, 
instead of one higher & one lower like the two filament bulbs.  The one 
filament bulbs have one bump on the end, the two filament have two bumps.  I 
don't rememeber bulb numbers.   I can go to my local Schuck's (aka Checkers 
or Kragen's depending on what part of the country) and buy them. Hope that 
helps.  Schuck's even has 6V bulbs... and orange front turn signal bulbs.   I 
recently got orange front TS bulbs for the 61.   They are more noticable than 
the clear, even though the orange bulb through the clear lens looks funny.  
They also have coloured dome light bulbs.   Dunno where to get the coloured 
dash light bulbs though.
