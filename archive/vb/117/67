Subject: Leaving for a while...New Jobby job

Hey all,

Well I finally got a new job working for the man, and doubt I'll be able
to resubscribe for awhile.  I just wanted to say thanks to everybody for
all the great reads, info and the help over the last few years.  I'll be
at OCTO/Classic with my bus and singlewheel trailer over with the SV2's
guys.  If anybody is interested, I put up a page on the site about my
busses and the roof replacement and how I have done it so far.  Anyways,
thanks everybody.  See ya soon.

Later,
Aaron
