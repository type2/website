july vwt, interveiw states"it would beirresponsible for vw's current buiseness to devote too many resources celebrating thepast.we must concentrate on today's products and customers" they just don't furcking get it, same ole song and dance from them.how they can think that a person thinks that wolfgang international is associated with the vw factory because they have a single cab with a vw emblem on it is way beyong my comprihetion. one thing i do know is that i have a 1961 vw single cab, 2001 nissan xterra, 2001 nissan pick up all in my garage and not a single water cooled vw, but i'm a customer of the past , and {i won't say never} but it will have to be a heck of a deal to ever buy a vw that was made after 1967, paul
