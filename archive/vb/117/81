NEATO is in transition to a new editor and Old Bus
Review will be functioning fully soon.  I hope we will
be seeing more great publications, and will talk to
Rich Yost when he comes back through Albuquerque early
next week.  He and others are involved in making NEATO
what it once was, the premier split bus club!
