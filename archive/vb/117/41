Subject: VW race on TV

  The Learning channel has a program on tonight (5/8) 
where two teams have to race a beetle through a course, 
then disassemble the car and take it through a house, 
then reassemble it and complete the race!
  Sorry for the short notice. I just heard about it and 
it sounds like fun so I thought I would pass it on.
