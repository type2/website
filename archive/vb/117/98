I've got an extra "vintage" copy of this if anyone is interested in an
older version. Don't recall the issue date, but can check and advise.
Five bux to the first taker...

I heard about this last evening at the Central Ohio Vintage Volkswagen

cooled technology.  Did you feel the same?  I intend to get a copy.
