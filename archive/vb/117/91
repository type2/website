Subject: RE: [VB] Fuel Filter question, re-usable

I have the glass fuel filter and have used them in the past. No complaints,
not prone to clogging or leaking, but I have broken one. Glass can be
problematic.

Hey Y'all,
Happy Friday.  While picking up brakes for my 71 Westy, I saw and bought a
re-usable fuel filter made by BugPack.  It's the glass kind with the
replaceable screen inside. My question: Has anyone used these, and if so, do
they leak or clog easily?? Adversely, do they filter finely enough?
