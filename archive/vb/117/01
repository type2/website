longevity of the engine or is it just good maintainance

walk in with a 1978 Transporter that he got from his father. He was in
buying
the basic tune-up parts, ie plugs and an air filter. He was just on his
way out to change his oil and told me that the bus had always had Duralube
added at every oil change, 215,000 original miles on a Desert bus, I guess
it must work or are type 4 engines really THAT good, especially in our heat.

Wow, they had Duralube in 1978?
