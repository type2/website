As far as interior/exterior color combos...
My 62 was turkis on the bottom, and white on top (original paint), the
inside of the bus was white.
My 61 is Sealing Wax Red on the bottom, and white on top (beige grey?) and
the interior of the bus is Sealing wax red...original paint also.  The 61 is
May 16, 1961...my 62 was December of 61, or January of 62...I forget.

So they changed it sometime between 61 and 62.

yes, but it isn't a standard, it's a kombi.  maybe that's a mute point.  the
only other thing i thought is that earlier buses, say pre '62ish, had a
front cabin painted the lower body color.  it wasn't unitl sometime in the
early '60's that they went to the upper color.  i could be completely wrong.
