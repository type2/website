Subject: Westy hitch material???  any ideas?

Anyone out there have an idea of the alloy of steel
used for the westy tow hitches?

Howabout any other hitches.  What kind of steel do
they make them out of?

Anyone know what kind of steel the guy in AZ was
making the tow bar's for buses out of?

Thanks for the help.
