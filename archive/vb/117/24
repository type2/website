Subject: RE: [VB] Berg Shifter?

I received lots of very positive feedback about this Berg bus shifter!  So I
thought I would post a few excerpts, since not many people responded
directly to the list:

>Slid into all the gears really sweet.<

>wouldn't leave home with-out it.<

>It is better than advertised. It has quality all over it.<

>This thing is just so sweet, I don't think you will ever regret.< 

>I can shift gears as smoothly as cutting through butter and I can do it
with my back on the seatback<

>I would never drive another bus without one.<


The main "issues" people relayed on to me were about the initial
installation and that all the shifter bushings need to be in good shape.
Basically it takes a little patience to get it lined up perfectly like any
shifter change, even stock.


Thanks for the great feedback!
