I'd suggest driving it for a couple of weeks and see if it gets better -
you just fixed the oil pressure springs last week, right?  If it's still
bad after that, maybe slip the clutch some on purpose and see if that
burns off any of the oil.  Maybe take the starter off, step on the clutch,
and squirt some solvent around in there through the starter hole?

Every once in a while, a wire will break underneath the insulation - it
looks fine but doesn't make contact.  Usually this happens close to the
ends.  You can get a straight pin and stick it through the wire to test
a wire in the middle - when you're done, take out the pin and put a bit
of electrical tape or even silicone sealer on the hole.
