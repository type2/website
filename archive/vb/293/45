Subject: Izzit too early to ask about Havasu?

Spousal unit has been asking me when the January trek to Lake Havasu will
occur. The '63 EZ camper remains untouched on the back porch.

I wish to clarify (Clara-fy?) the dates in which this Winter event will occur.
Looking forward to offending everyone in person. (I mean, spend time with all
of my friends).

Daughter believes that she is the Black Stallion or Black Beauty depending on
the day. Son is picking up a ton of vocabulary that only the Mother unit can
interperet. Dad is still the same SOB that he always has been.

I gotta see them red G-strings one more time.
Please advise
