Subject: RE: [VB] E-bay 88 Berg strokers FS

  These are very rare and a good deal unless you ruin one!! I have located
85.5 stroker pistons and am building 2 82X85.5 stroker engines now. these
work out to 1885 and with the long stroke and small pistons should be a
stump puller. Will dyno this to see what it will do. 
  1 is getting a CSP 911 style shroud, duel 44's and all the other good
speed goodies, etc. and the other will get duel 40's, heat flap and
thermostat and all the other stock cooling goodies, heater boxes etc
