Ummm, why? Because he didn't want to work on your bus? I'm sorry ,but
you are knocking on this guy just because he chooses not to work on
your bus. Ask anyone here on the list that works on air cooled cars if
you can really sustain a business just working on those. The answer
that keeps coming up is no. A mechanic that has enough work to suit
his needs had the luxurary of picking and choosing what he works on in
some cases. This guy has no history with you as a customer, so he is
in the dark about what else might be involved with this job. Sure if
times get tough for him, he might wish he had not turned away
prospective customers earlier, but it's his decision.

Remember, it's not as simple as he is lazy. A mechanic makes money by
working on cars. Anytime he spends time not billing for time he is
losing money. Knowing how many people are in general toward mechanics
this guy may be very choosy on whos antique autos he works on. He may
have spent way too many nights worrying about how he could pay the
morgage that month after he spent 12 hours last week trying to fix a
problem on an old vw that the customer incisted was his fault, instead
of working on a billed job. Moral of the story, cut the guy some
slack, just because he won't work on your bus doesn't mean he's lazy.
After all, you don't like to work on your bus, but that doesn't mean
your lazy.
