Oops. I meant the power wire to the horn.

I posted up a picture on Vintagebus.com once that shows the route of the
horn wire, as it exits the steering box, through the clamp on the box,
and then on to the horn.  Go to Vintagebus.com and search for 'David
Mayes'.  I posted the picture on march 3, 2003.  Other similar pictures
are on my 'underbus' web page for the double cab but the one on
Vintagebus is larger.

Will someone tell me where the horn wire exits the body under the cab? I
replaced my cab floors and now I don't know where to run the wire.
