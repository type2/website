Yeah, man - no way would I use one while driving.  The NOS in-dash 
units came with an interlock switch to prevent that -- the carb won't 
close when the coil's hot (brilliant and unhackable, especially when 
the short-term memory's gone), so you just suck air.  Strictly doobs 
while on the road, I say -- preferably sized to match the cigar 
lighter.  What was the question?

That does drive me nuts.  "Hippie bus!"  Like they know.  "Bite me," I 
smile, and flash a peace sign while I drive away with my "Karma" and 
"stopthedrugwar.org" bumper stickers on the back.

Now don't go gratuitously reinforcing another dumb stereotype.  What 
would Jeff and Tracy think? (http://tinyurl.com/wa06).
