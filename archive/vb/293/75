I say lazy because his answer to my missing bolt problem is to wind out the
gears
and see if that doesn't make the noise stop.  Lazy because he says he would
NOT
bother replacing the broken bolt because it won't hurt anything .. Are you
saying that
the rest of the people on the list who tell me how dangerous it is to drive
the bus with
a broken bolt are wrong ??? Maybe "lazy" is not a good word .. maybe he is
not lazy,
just doesn't know ESS about VW's .. or maybe everyone else is over
re-acting.
