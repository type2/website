   You need to ride in another lowered bus. With any lowered bus they ride a 
little
harder even in the front (even through theoreticly they shouldnt as lowered
spindles leave all the torsions). If yours is noticably worse than another 
one
(thats done the same way, the common way, spindles), id suggest taking it 
all apart
and cleaning everything and greasing it and make sure everything is not 
stuck and working
as it should. Id first remove the shocks and drive it around and see if that 
fixes it. On bugs
ive had friends that bought the fancy shmancy kyb gas adjusts for the front 
of a bug (no
weight) and it makes it ride really hard for no real reason, you put pep 
boys cheapo shocks
and it drives better! Could be a simular thing. If the shocks are binding 
youre off easy. Next
id see if your front beam has adjusters. ive never had good luck with them, 
but adjusting
them around (many tries) can usually get better results. If it has no 
adjusters, just spindles
move on. Is it REALLY low? (like gregs slamomatic system? (which actually 
looks like it drives
ok somehow). If not it should be drivable and safe. (although plenty of 
folks will tell you
lowered busii are dangerous, im not necesarily a believer). Youll just have 
to disect it and
learn to take it all apart and clean and grease it all and put it back 
toegether and see what
if anything is binding. Mine was like that from sitting (10 years) but 
driving and greasing
everything seems to have helped it quite a bit.

I wrote about my stiff front end suspension in my lowered '65 about a month 
ago.
I did not lower the bus so I don't know exactly how it was done.  The rear 
is
IRS and the front has drop spindles.  The list suggestion was to remove my
torsion arms and check to see if I have any leaves in the torsion tubes.  
Okay
I've finally accomplished that (I don't want to get into why it took me a 
month)
:P.  Here is what I found
Each beam had a fully assortment of 9 leaves each.  (I read through the 
archives
and 9 seems to be the magic number for my year of bus)  They do seem to be
seperated at the drivers side end (I haven't taken off the passenger side).  
I
mention that because I've seen word about arc welding the ends of the 
leaves.
Any ideas now as to why my bus ride would be so rough?  I should note that 
the
top bolt for the shock absorber (drivers side) was slightly bent when I 
removed
it; is that normal?  Is there a way to test a shock to see if it needs to be
replaced?
