Can't use those pressures in the Bentley.Those are for bias ply tires.
Radials need more air to make them wear right.

See pages B-11 1 and B-11 4 of your '63-'67 Bentley manual.  If you don't
have one, get one.  This info is also in the owners manual, but those are
a little harder to come by... prowl the swap meets.  Some later Buses will
have a sticker somewhere that lists the tire pressures, but I don't think
VW did this on splits.
