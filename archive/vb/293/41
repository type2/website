when I replaced the tie rods on my 66 I used a 3/2 jaw gear puller. I
was able to get it on all ends except for the drag link. To get that
one off I pulled the arm from the steering box first and was able to
get to the drag link end that way. There is also a hazet tool out that
that will do all the ends easily, but I don't want to spend the cash
for that one tool. search the hazet site for the tool. Oh, also used a
lot of pb blaster. good luck
