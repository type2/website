Subject: Yet another mechanic

Pulling into the gas station last week a guy says to me, "Did you get that
bus from Bruce?"  My answer is "yes." This person recognized my bus [because
it looks so different since it sat in his parking lot] from the screwed up
cut out that someone way-back-when made to accommodate large wheels.  We get
to talking, he agrees that the "Mechanics From Hell" are truly the
"Mechanics From Hell."  He just goes there when he needs some welding done.

Anyway . .He gave me the name of yet another mechanic and I contacted him.
He is going to come by my house tomorrow and take a look at the RGBox so I
don't have to drive it any more than absolutely necessary.

Turns out this guy ALSO knows the "Mechanics From Hell" and knows my bus.
He says, "is your bus the one that someone hit in Bruce's parking lot ??"
Yes.  He says he was there the day when Bruce RUINED my rear bumper by
cutting holes in it to accommodate the pea shooters.  He commented to Bruce
about the mess and Bruce said that was what I wanted .. HUH ??? OH YEAH ,
please destroy a perfectly good bumper so you don't have to do any
additional work to make the engine fit with those pea shooters.

Hopefully this person will fix the bolt and that will be one more repair out
of the way.  I don't know if I mentioned that the other mechanic told me the
center pivot bushing needs to be replaced.  A job I already paid TOO MUCH
MONEY FOR to the MFH ... This other mechanic didn't want to make any
negative comments about the MFH   ... but said that either the bushing kit
they used was defective or they didn't do the job right because 66% of the
steering play was coming from that bushing.

When the bolt is fixed I will photo it before and after .. keep the broken
bolt because it was that way from DAY ONE when I got the bus.  I will keep
the broken bolt and bring it with me to court .. I have a list a mile long
.. The MFH are going to pay me back .. that is FOR SURE [I hope] ..
