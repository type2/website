Subject: NEW Interior mirrors/more specials

   Another new item for all you split bus owners, 55 to 66 interior bus
mirrors. These are exact copies of originals. I would let you all know first
to get a great introductory price before the real retail happens. I will
have them today and will post pics to the samba in a little while.
