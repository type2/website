Thom, the list administrator, has made one or two comments on this from
time to time.  :)  I don't get the people in parking lots, but when I
drive my Bus to work or school, I get people asking me similar things -
"You gonna paint flowers on it?  Are you a hippie?"  If it's a younger
kid (teenager or down) asking if I'm a hippy, I patiently explain that
by the time I was old enough to understand what a hippy was, most of
the hippies had started trading junk bonds on Wall Street.  If it's an
older person I just say "No."

I predict that the Bus world is in for a bit of a shake-up when VW
releases the new one.  I remember that prices for air-cooled Bugs seemed
to go up noticeably when they released the New Beetle.

Have you or anyone ever tried Muir's suggestion for oil-soaked brake
shoes (soak them in Coleman fuel, place on hard level surface, light
fuse, get away)?  I'd be more inclined to try this with riveted
friction surfaces than bonded ones.

Sic transit gloria mundi.  (Tuesdis are usally worse.)

Wait... you're trying to say your Bus _didn't_ love grease?
