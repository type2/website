Subject: Re: & my 65 Re: [VB] Another Lazy Mechanic

People do this to me ALL THE TIME. .. thing is, I look like an Old Hippie.
I AM AN OLD HIPPIE .. but haven't smoked a joint in two decades or more and
I have a 4 year accounting degree.  I wear round eye glasses, [more like
Ozzie Osborne] but people say John Lennon glasses.  Someone asked, "did you
get those John Lennon glasses to go with your van?"  I told them "no .. got
the BUS to go with my glasses."  "NOT VAN" .. I always have a need to
correct them!!  I have been wearing round glasses for longer than I can
remember .. And another comment is "anyone ever tell you that you look like
Janis Joplin ?"  OH GOD!! I always say you mean the "pig face or the
horrible acne?"  [her classmates called her "pig face" and her skin was
pretty bad.]  I don't think she had a pig face, not me.  I look NOTHING like
her.  Except I have long hair and wear glasses.

Anyhow .. I don't really mind the hippie comments.  But I do get annoyed at
how little attention they pay to detail .. They are Not John Lennon
Glasses - and they are NOT Janis Joplin glasses .. and it is a bus .. not a
van .. and what sort of nut case would buy their glasses to match their "VAN
.. "

Peace, Diane

> I can't be the only person annoyed by stupid middle aged clean cut wierdo
strangers with minivans who come up to me in parking lots saying "WOWW,
Woodstock mannn!"  making joint smoking gestures.  If that was my scene, I
wouldn't have it together to have a decent bus.   can't help or want to know
about what they did when they were young.  sc%%%w them and their inner
children .   Okay  .... rant mode off...
