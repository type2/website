Ya, I like the feel of the 9 spring clutch better too.   If you already bought the pad thing, why not keep using the new pad, but rinse off the 9 spring metal part of the clutch in gasoline or brake cleaner, and then scuff up the face where it'll hit the pad with sandpaper like St Muir said.  

I guess you solved the source of the oil issue, the oil seal or whatever it was (?)

Well I feel  better if you're pulling the motor to mess with the clutch too.
