  Well here is an update on the Swiss boys and their 79 Westy. They left
Flaggstaff and visited the Grand Canyon. From there they went to Lost Wages
for some r/r, got smart and took my advice and bought a prepaid cell pone.
From there they are going (today) to Death Valley and from there to FRESNO
(be prepared Karl and HH) they are going to look you up.
  The bus is running fine and again they thank all the list members for
advice and places to rest at.

The Swiss brothers are enroute to the Grand Canyon now. They have lost 14 
days of traveling time due to the bus mishaps since they got it. But it does
not 
impact the final goal much: The goal is to reach Montreal, Quebec by Dec. 
20th, when Patrick's gf would fly in from Europe to meet and travel with
them till 
January, when they will fly home from NYC together.. Between now and Dec. 
20th they want to visit all the places along the Pacific coast. Marcel, boss
of 
his 2 Huskies, would fulfill his goal of visiting Alaska (by train) during
this 
time. Because of the northbound direction the brothers are not lingering
much 
around the American Southwest. After a day or so in the GC they will double 
quick to Las Vegas. Then it's Fresno CA from there. Still a bit of
mysterious 
oi leak on the engine, but they're confident they will make it back to Cali.


Great guests in whatever vehicle they choose, and to their credit they chose

the bus. I am sure we as a community can make it up for them, where the loss

of time is replaced by VW hospitality.
