Subject: travel postcard from P & C - final installment trip 2003

Date:    Nov 21, 2003 8:26 PM 

A couple weeks ago we were in Winslow AZ. We got a call from Beto, a VW friend of ours in southern California. He had heard that they were evacuating parts of Hesperia because of the fires and knew that we were on the road. He called to find out if he needed to drive up and get anything from the house for us. We called neighbors but the fire was on the other side of town, over 6 miles away.

As we have traveled we have met many people, helped many folks, and been helped by many. After we have helped others we are always ask how they can pay us back. That phone call shows how we get paid back. It's also the librarian who took us home after about an hour at her library computer looking for help when we broke down in Pine River, MN.

We have just finished a five and a half month cruise. Some of you have been following our postcards from the first and some have been added to our list as we met you along the way. We hope you enjoyed the P & C travel channel - 68DC.

We have enjoyed visiting with old and new friends and family. We have seen lots of places from Lake Superior, Wisconsin to Big Bend in Texas. We made two family reunions and 10 VW/car shows. The trip would not have been possible without the hundreds of lives we interfaced with. 

So to everyone who gave us a place to stay, or let us experience their lives - thank you. And to all the people we helped with plumbing, painting, electrical or visiting - you are welcome, glad we could help. And to everyone we talked with, played with, spent time with, helped or offered help, were helped, forwarded our adventures to the WWW, or took care of home - it was fun. Thank you for letting us into your life and sharing time with us.

Oh ... one last postcard. At least for this trip.
