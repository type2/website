OK. The reason I asked about drag was because Bentley says there should be
some drag at the center point. Problem is, it doesn't say how much there
should be. It also says there should be some _clicking_ when the steering
wheel is turned back and forth. Mine doesn't click, it's more of a clunk.
Think that may be like the difference between fweem and fwoom?

well, the ideal is to set it where it has no play and no drag.   This ideal
had completely unworn parts in the steering box, and of course no slop
anywhere else in the steering, and may not be acheived by your bus.  If
there is a choice between drag and play, I choose play.

If you have drag, it's too tight and this will wear things. when you adjust
it correctly there wil be no drag, but will be slop in some places.  You can
decide how bad you can deal with it before you replace it.  If the steering
box is thunking, time to start thinking about replacing it.
