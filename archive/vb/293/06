Subject: fixing up my 65

After putting a new motor and steering box in this bus, I have unbolted and bolted back on about every dern part in the bus, except for the front beam.  literally.   How did that happen.   I just wanted something to drive around, and about 7 years later I practically rebuildt the entire vehicle.   

Ah, it's amazing, I have rarely seen such un- sloppy steering.  

   I think the slight clutch slipping came from the excess oil being pushed past the main seal by the excess oil pressure that was caused by the stupid 'heavy duty' oil pressure springs.
 *** So should I pull the engine and clean the clutch, or hope it heals itself?  ***

I replaced the foot high beam switch, which was wearing out and sometimes not wanting to have low beams on.   As there is a rust hole in the floor, I had to make a patch piece to screw one end of the switch too.  this is ridiculous.   I have all these patches on the front floor. (bus had safaris) Oughta fix it right one day.  well the headlights seem brighter now, and the low beams always come on, so far.

removed the horn and bench tested it with a battery charger.   BRAAAAPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  it works.   

no power at power wire to horn, which is that yellow/black one from the right most fuse, and it has power going into the wire.  Hopefully I'm  crossing paths somewhere.   Horn used to work fine, then stopped one day.
