Subject: Attn Cal :  regarding my horn button

When I was at the Tampa show swap/meet I found a "like new" horn button and
I am ready to install it.  Searched through my notes and found your post on
how to install.  Apparently you didn't finish part II because I can't find
it anywhere, even when I go to the archives.

PS .. haven't found a "friend" to accompany me out west .. would the
Brooklyn Bridge do ?? I would love a trip to NYC.


Cal's Aug 10th post below.

  Actually, the technique is to pull up under the Golden Gate Bridge at
  night, have a friend climb the west tower and toss a heavy chain down over
  the edge of the bridge, then secure it on the bridge. Then you both haul a
  large winch, gasoline powered, onto the bridge sidewalk, the south side to
  be exact. Next, you guide the chain down from the bridge, into the hole
  that you cut into the roof of the bus, and wrap it around the steering
  wheel. Be sure to remove the horn button first! And dettach the horn wire.
  Use a padlock to secure the end of the chain to itself after wrapping
  around the steerin wheel. Start the bus's engine, and let it warm up.
  Next, pack the lower edge of the steering wheel around the pole, just
  above the knee guard, with a small amount of plastic explosive putty, and
  embed a fuse wire into the putty, going all the way around the pole...
  continued next week.
