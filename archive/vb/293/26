gotta say i was a little disappointed!  yes, the fweem (or fwoom) 
sound is a resonance caused by the muffler baffles, back pressure 
etcetc...  i was hoping for some stuff along the lines of "dry 
muffler bearings" or "all the Black Forest Elves trapped in the 
muffler screaming as they are burned alive."

ok, maybe not the last one............
