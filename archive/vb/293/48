Subject: cleaning clutch plates

I have had good results with the NON-factory approved method
of soaking the oiled up clutch in petrol and tossing a match
at it from a safe distance, then letting it burn itself out.
Repeat a couple of times, then wash clutch plate with soap
and water and dry. Roughen up any glaze with sand paper
before reinstalling clutch.

I had a spigot shaft seal blow in my 63 Dormobile back in
1996; dumped gear oil all over the clutch. I pulled the
engine at a campsite and burned the oil off the clutch and
reinstalled. I'm still using that same clutch plate.

AS I pointed out in the first line of this post. This method
is quite successful, but it is NOT factory approved. That is
to say, play with fire at your own risk!
