Subject: & my 65 Re: [VB] Another Lazy Mechanic

How frustrating when you just want your old bus to work the way it should.  It 's stupid how people have dumb sterotypes about all VW buses being driven by stoned hippies smoking bongs while driving, keeping it together with bubble gum.  Sounds like the one dude is a good mechanic, hope that works well for you.   

I can't be the only person annoyed by stupid middle aged clean cut wierdo strangers with minivans who come up to me in parking lots saying "WOWW, Woodstock mannn!"  making joint smoking gestures.  If that was my scene, I wouldn't have it together to have a decent bus.   can't help or want to know about what they did when they were young.  sc%%%w them and their inner children .   Okay  .... rant mode off...

talking of having a decent bus, I am pulling the d(-at-)mn motor back out of the 65 as the clutch is slipping and I gotta clean it off.   The first oil change is due, so I pulled the plug when I got home today, and it's dripping into the bucket.

hopefully it was the oil pressure weirdness that made the clutch get icky.   It was a lovely clean new disc and 9 spring clutch, too.   <sob>
