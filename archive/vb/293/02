Subject: How much air ??

What is the recommend air in the tires of a 67 bus.  I don't think it is in
the idiot book ... My son gave me 4 new Yokohama tires for the bus.  NICE ..
I can actually FEEL them gripping the road.  The kid that put them on put
too much air in and I felt like I was floating .. I WAS .. let some air out
and it is much better.  Which reminds me ...

A million years ago I remember hearing stories from my brother and friends
who worked at a gas station on Miami Beach in their teens.  It would go
something like .... some person pulls up for full service [everything was
full service back then] in their Caddy, which he and I and everyone else
referred to as a "Jew Canoe" [It's ok to say that ... we are Jewish as well]
while one of the boys were under the hood checking oil etc the driver would
HONK THEIR HORN to remind them to check the air in the tires.  You ever hear
the horn up close on a Caddy??? LOUD !!!! This would almost ALWAYS cause the
attendant to jump and bang their head on the hood of the car .. and their
revenge was to over fill the tires with air ... OK .. not nice or funny now,
but back when I too was a teen, it was hysterical.
