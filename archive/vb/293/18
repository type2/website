Problems with people cutting you off in traffic??  Give them a blast they
won't forget!!!

A fellow Buskatier just reminded me of one of the funniest and loudest
things I have ever seen mounted to the roof rack of a deluxe splitty (no it
wasn't someones mother in law).  At our latest Bustoberfest campout, a
Buskatier had mounted train airhorns to his roof rack along with a large air
bubble to power them.  You would not believe the sound coming out of those
suckers!!!  You could hear him for miles, sounded like a train was coming
through the campground.  Matt said the air tank could run the horn for 5
minutes straight, he and a friend tested it before the trip.

Here is an example of the type of horn he had on the bus:
