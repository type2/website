Ain't it a bitch?  Seems like everytime I wear a von dutch t-shirt or my bike 
jacket with a von dutch patch on it, people ask where to get one.  I make it 
a point to educate them on the finest pinstriper/customizer of all time.  

It was real funny at the last OCTO.  I'm sittin in the EZ sportin my VonDutch 
t-shirt when some older fella stops and mumbles to his friend about how "that 
kid probably doesn't know who VonDutch was"  We ended up having about a 
half-hour conversation.  That guy was lucky enough to have spent a lot of time with 
him in his later years.

As for the maltese cross......yeah it's getting played out....but what cool 
thing isn't-sooner or later.  I think my EZ may be sportin one at Havasu...with 
a big flying eyeball underneath it.
I'm actually glad to see a resurgence of the hot rod/kustom scene.  Sure as 
hell beats the riced out hondas.

grave and pokes their eyes out with the pointy end of his camelhair 
pinstriper.
