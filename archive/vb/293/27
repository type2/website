I have always wanted to do this to a Bug.  Probably cause wrecks when I
sound it...

>Here is an example of the type of horn he had on the bus:

Aw, that one's only got 3 horns.  Some of the railroad ones have up to
6 horns:

At least it does appear to be new, and not from Midnight Train Salvage.

Tip: If you decide to do this, use a manual air valve.  Locomotives used
to have manual air valves, but now they have solenoid-operated ones.  The
solenoid ones have led to complaints of trains being too loud, because
they're either all the way on or all the way off.  With the manual valve,
the engineer can crack it open part way if he's required to blow the
horn but he doesn't want to wake up the neighborhood (example: switching
moves in a yard that's close to houses - there are usually no crossings
to worry about, but the rules say he has to blow the horn pretty often.)
