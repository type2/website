Subject: TMI - carmel brown

So ... I posted this message to try and find out what the TMI Carmel brown
seat covers are like.  My other option is to get some vinyl in a similar
colour and try and persuade my wife to make em.  I've seen vinyl for sale at
Standard Auto Glass in Kingston ON and without having an original piece to
compare em to it did look like they had something that was close.  I guess
all try and get my wife to make em - she is actually very good with a sewing
machine. She figures I'll need about 3 metres for the front seats.  The
price at Standard Auto Glass is just over $20.00 Canadian per yard - so ...
likely cost about $60.00 Canadian or ... maybe just over $40.00 US.

 If they turn out OK I'll post a pic.
