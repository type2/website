Subject: Single Cab Gate latches WANTED

Hi Folks,

I am still looking for a decent set of front gate
latches for my `66 Single cab.  

These are the ones that are tapped or threaded for the
bolts to come through the cab into the latch.  The
bend in the latch arm also points away from the latch.
 

I need just the front pair. 
Thanks
todd
