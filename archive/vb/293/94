Maybe if I had ALL the perfect tools including a lift I wouldn't be afraid
of tackling some things .. Trouble is, I would be afraid to turn the key if
I did any work on it.  ESPECIALLY STEERING .. as for crawling under the bus
.. besides the creepy crawlies all over the place in Florida, I can
GUAR-AN-TEE that the first time I swung a hammer I would break my nose !!!
To tell the gods honest truth, I can just barely walk and chew gum, you know
I either trip or bite my tongue .. My mother called me "Grace."  She would
say "every move a picture !!"

PS .. My friend, the one I was going to share my liver with passed away this
morning ..
