Ya, BTDT, cheaper than brake cleaner.  
except I used gasoline. let it soak in a oil drain bucket a bit.  remove from bucket, which is plastic and would probably melt.  You can hold the shoe with a pair of vise grips while it burns.   Gasoline is not as explosive as the movies imply.   but tie hair back.

so true,
 I guess for everything there is a time and a place, and your clutch (or mine, to be more (specific) 
does not love grease.   nor oil.  do not oil your clutch every tuneup.
