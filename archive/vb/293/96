Subject: more steering box stuff

I actually got out my 1963 Transporter Workshop Manual and read about steering boxes.   The thing is my book is original (not Bentley reprint) so I don't get it greasy in the garage, which can be inconvenient.   well, it said make sure the bracket pinch bolts aren't overtorqued or it can break things.  I had just pulled them hard.  OOOPPS.   So I go under the bus and check the torque, which was too high, and undo the lock plate, and adjust the tightness, and the wheel turns much easier now.   It wasn't just the grease solidified that made it harder to turn.  doh.

Put the pedal splash pan on as well, after using a tap to clean out some nasty crunchy threads.   ignored the broken off bolts.  put M6 x 1.00 x 10 hex head bolts on my shopping list

So, um, read the book.  :)  and trust yourself, if something doesn't feel right, probably something isn't right.
