those are kewl, but everyone and his dog has that symbol on now, 
courtesy of west coast choppers and the ilk... can't wade thru the 
mall w/out piling up bodies marked with it.

and what the HELL is up w/ von dutch??? a TRUE american weirdo icon 
AND vw-lover turned into a hottie-label clothing line aka abercrombie 
and childpornfitch? i mean, did his relatives sell his corpse the 
SECOND he died, or what????????? hopefully he comes back from the 
grave and pokes their eyes out with the pointy end of his camelhair 
pinstriper.


ummmmm.......  sorry.   the von dutch thing had been bugging me for a 
while, tho.  i feel better now.
