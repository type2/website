Spousal unit has been asking me when the January trek to Lake Havasu will
occur. The '63 EZ camper remains untouched on the back porch.

I gotta see them red G-strings one more time.
Please advise

Never too early.....I think someone might have a leather studded g-string

Weekend of the 16th, I believe.  Prepwork on my 63EZ has just begun.  Anyone 
got a good used 66-67 wiper shaft?
