Me too. I had a 60 in 1965 van before there were hippies. I used it to sleep
over at the beach when I went surfing at Malibu. I went to Filmore and saw
Big Brother before anyone knew who Janis Joplin was. I stopped driving buses
because everyone else was driving them. Now I have returned and am feeling
quite at home.
Peace.
