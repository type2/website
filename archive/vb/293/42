What annoyed me the most was actually 2 things combined.
1)  He said "I have driven them forever with the bolts missing or broken."
2)  His answer was to up the RPMs before shifting so I didn't hear the
thunk.

I told him I could turn up the stereo and not hear the "THUNK" but that is
NOT
the way I want the noise to go away.  PLUS he insisted that loose bolts
would
FOR SURE NOT make that noise. ... but whatever it is .. "just drown the
noise
out by shifting to 2nd at 30 mph or whatever ..

PS .. almost ANY job was TOO MUCH for him.  He likes to tune up and ??
Stuff that I can actually do myself if I tried .. He is NOT a mechanic in my
eyes.
Should be working at Jiffy Lube or something ..

> How frustrating when you just want your old bus to work the way it should.
It 's stupid how people have dumb sterotypes about all VW buses being driven
by stoned hippies smoking bongs while driving, keeping it together with
bubble gum.  Sounds like the one dude is a good mechanic, hope that works
well for you.
