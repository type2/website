Subject: Brake wheel cylinder paste...

Hi all,

I'm in the throes of rebuilding a few 4-5 year old wheel ATE cylinders 
and all looks real nice.  So I go to find a tube of brake wheel cylinder 
paste to use for re-assembly of the cylinders and of course I can't find 
any!  Is the stuff still available at a local parts house anymore?  I 
know this is the world of just install a new one and hurl the old one in 
the garbage, but these are in nice condition and are easily 
rebuildable.  Bosch used to make the stuff in a tube, but a few local 
joints that I've called already just don't stock the stuff.  Any ideas?
