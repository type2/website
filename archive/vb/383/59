Subject: Buses By the Beach - Raffle and Silent Auction Items Needed! 

Hello, Fellow Bus Pilots:

 

We are one month away from the Fourth Annual Bus Benefit hosted by Buses By
the Beach in Grand Rapids, MI May 19-21st. We have a couple of things to
share with our bus friends in this email; raffle items, T-shirts, and Buses
By the Beach pocket knives. 

 

Item 1) We are sending out a call to our wonderful bus family for raffle and
silent auction items to help us raise money for Burn Survivors!!! Anyone
donating items of higher value can get a charitable giving receipt from the
Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors. 

 

Here is what we have so far:

 

1.        Awesome VW Split Window bus painting going up for auction!  Famed
Michigan artist Stephano Owen Sutherlin (http://stephanostudios.com). He has
graciously donated time and talent to create a one-of-a-kind rendering of a
one-of-a-kind vehicle:  the beloved VW Split Window Bus.  Declared value is
$900. This painting can be previewed online at:
http://busesbythebeach.com/busprint.jpg  The painting will be in a Silent
Auction at Bus Benefit hosted by Buses By the Beach.
(www.busesbythebeach.com) It is a VW Bus gathering at the Grand Rogue
Campground in Belmont. Michigan.  All proceeds from every Buses by the Beach
event benefits our favorite charity, The Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors.
(http://www.phoenix-society.org <http://www.phoenix-society.org/> ) Thank

for making the arrangements.

like; GoWesty t-shirts, Westfalia logo stickers, Westfalia Pop-top decals,
License Plate Frames, GoWesty Key Chains, and lots of copies of their latest
catalog. Thank you to Taylor and Lucas of GoWesty for their financial
contribution toward our cause and for the many wonderful items.

Mix. Thanks to Mark Kruezer who lined this one up.

6.       Hirt-N-Knife is donating several Buses By the Beach Knives. They
have donated some in the past for the raffle and many people have inquired
about buying one. There will be a few for purchase so contact Billy Hirt at
616-240-2839 or send and email to aiirdude(-at-)ameritech.net. The cost of each
knife is $65.00 and a portion goes to The Phoenix Society. Order by May 7th.

I know there is a ton more stuff out there that you guys are planning on
bringing to the event. If you have items to add please contact Pete O at
pnocean(-at-)earthlink.net and let him know. I will be starting a thread on the
Buses By the Beach Forum if you would like to list your item that you are
going to donate for others to see. Go to:

Item 2) We are only five days away from the closing of the T-shirt
pre-order. If you want a shirt that is smaller then adult medium or larger
than adult XL then it is important to pre-order your shirt or you might be
out of luck. The most common sizes of M, L, XL will be produced but we
always sell out of the smaller and larger sizes because it is very difficult
to forecast how many to make. Please take a moment to contact Brien Dews to
place your shirt order. Check them out at:

Shirts are $15 each and shipping is $5 per order. Payment can be by check,
PayPal or phone in credit card to Brien Dews at 616-863-8463. If you use
PayPal you can send payment to volksfolks(-at-)busesbythebeach.com and be sure to
put in the notes your name, address, sizes, quantities and whether or not
you want them shipped. Checks can be made out to All Good Time Clock Service
and send them to:
