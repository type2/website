Subject: Re: [VB] paint code help

 I was extemely please with the match for Velvet Green that I got about 6? years ago for my 65 westy.  It was PPG, and the PPG paint stor ehad the mixing recipe from teh L code I had behind the passneger seat.
 
It matched the engine compartment just lovely, nice on the engine lid with is og on the inside, repaint on the outside.  Blended into the og green on the insode of the drivers door.  It is lighter than what you tend to think of Velvet Green being.   This is because Velvet Green darkens with ages, and yes my bus has slowly gotten a bit darker than when it was freshly painted.  
 
 I am still very happy with the paint match to the og velvet green.

Hello everyone, 
I need some help. I am trying to purchase L-512 velvet green paint for my westy and my paint store cannot seem to match it. What am I doing wrong and where can I get it? I prefer it in acrylic enamel. 
Thanks for the help, 
Boyd Smith
