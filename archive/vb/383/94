So its ok that whiny can put up a web site of lies about me but as soon as  I 
say something about him then I'm the bad guy,
 
well understand that I could write up a web site that makes him look like  
scum he is sense I DID LIVE WITH HIM FOR A MONTH. 
 
I have proved he has lied many times about me and that I have not said one  
thing about him that's been false.
 
as far as having the bones to post here what gives anyone the right to say  I 
can't, when I 'am sure I have helped a lot of people. I have been driving and 
 working on air cooled VW's for 27 yrs now. I also run a very successful VW  
repair and restoration business so I feel I have as much right as anyone  else 
here to post.
