Hi tomaboyd,
There is only three ways we can see how you could do that.
 
1.  Cut off the nose of the bus just above the front beam.
2.  Cut the bus in half (left to right).
3.  Cut off the shift rod tube, underbody framework, and some of the  
suspension.
 
All the above of course will require some welding during the reassembly....  
;-)
  We thinks that removing the engine and tranny, will be in the end  be a lot 
easier.
