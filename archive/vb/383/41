Thanks Philip and Cathrine!!

Diane,

The idea of safety wire is to tie up the bolt head so it cannot come out. 
Take a look at the nuts on all your front suspension parts. Almost all of 
them have a hole drilled thru the bolt. The nuts on these bolts are called 
castle nuts and a cotter pin is pushed thru the nut and hole in the bolt 
preventing the nut from spinning off. Bolts sometimes have holes drilled 
thru the head to allow a wire to be threaded thru and tied up in such a 
manner that the bolt cannot loosen. Take a look at the link in P&C's email. 
There are excellent examples of safety wire techniques. A safety wire tool 
is not particularly necessary for automotive work. Just use a plier to twist 
the wire tight.

The bolt holding the long shift bar to the trans shift shaft has no specific 
tie down point so the wire should be threaded thru the head and then wrapped 
around the shaft and pulled tight.
