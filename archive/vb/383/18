Ave  and Bethany Home Road.

Now for the Good stuff 

 Car show participants will receive FREE!!!! Commemorative Gift---PLUS 2
Lunch tickets, Last year was Bar Be Que Beef with FREE Drinks!! Extra lunch
tickets all of $5.00. Free Goodie Bag-FREE Door prize tickets !! Last year
my FREE raffle prize was worth over $100 !!!!.

Ahh there is a catch !! They are asking you to bring some canned food for
the Rescue Mission.

2nd catch. They are asking you to bring in your car to the FREE car show

Wouldn't a VW Bus caravan look very cool coming in together?
