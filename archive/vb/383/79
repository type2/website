Subject: Re: [VB] strange offer - thoughts?

About 25 years ago, I was picking up my bus at a repair shop. The guy  
behind the counter said, "Some guy is waiting for you." I thought,  
great, I'm gonna get jumped.

I go out to my bus and this stranger has his checkbook open and wants  
to write me a check for 5k. I just smiled and said it wasn't for  
sale. He said, OK, $5500 then. I thanked him again for the offer but  
I wasn't interested. I remember he turned around and muttered  
something under his breath like, "stupid kid doesn't know what he's  
got."

Of course I did. Though I probably should have taken the money and  
invested in Dell stock, but being 17 I probably wouldn't have done  
that.
