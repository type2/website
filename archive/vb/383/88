Here is something that is a bit different regarding these guys. I have 
an engine in my 66 with about 80k trouble free miles. I purchased this 
from aircooled.net a few years ago and have been tickled pink with it. I 
know from experience with this engine and a lot of here-say that it runs 
a low CR. As I am comtemplating what a rebuild will perhaps entail I 
started to wonder if anyone has done any real measuring on the 
internals. Specifically has anyone checked the volume of the Combustion 
chamber, or happened to measure a typical deck height. The general 
thought seems to be that dished pistons are used in this motor, but can 
anyone confirm this? From some searches on the web I could find nothing 
specific, other than aircooled seems to offer a head upgrade (which if 
you guys know the answers that would be great) and for obvious reasons 
have at least seen what the stock setup seems to be.
