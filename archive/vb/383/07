IMO, the only shop I would recomend is Bridgewaters
Auto Body. Location is Tacoma, his is a small one man
shop, his workmanship is excelent, he did my 60 double
cab a few years back & i was very pleased. His
reputation stands above the rest.
 As for price? there will be those who get paid for
what they say they can do.

Let me know:
If you have had experience with paint/body work on an
early VW.
How above board the shop is.
Pricing???


Update:  I bought an early nose, now just have to find
a good shop to 
do the
transplant...
