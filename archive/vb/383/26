I heard that the painting in the headlight buckets happned inother buse stooo... kind of neat.
 
I've seen buses w/o ground to the headlight wires... they ground to the body.  I think it was a year thing, but I'm not sure.

I wonder how the headlights were working at all in the first place. Did 
it have the short brown wire from the parking light bulb to the headlamp 
ground terminal? That might explain it; on my '64 the parking light 
bulbs have that short brown wire, but the parking light socket is also 
designed to ground the bulb to the metal headlamp shell. That would 
provide enough of a ground for the headlights to work, at least until 
you hit a real good bump or something.

Maybe they figured that some dealer mechanic would have to diagnose the 
headlights before delivery and would get to admire their finger-paint 
skillz. :)
