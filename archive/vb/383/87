Subject: Re: [VB] strange offer - thoughts?

A follow-up on my story to round out some lingering questions/ 
concerns, and to those concerned that I would turn down 5k for a beat- 
up old bus. (This additional information won't help at all.)

My '65 21 window at the time was baby blue with sporty white spoke  
baja wheels and Cooper tires on the front and crazy-wide Mickey  
Thompsons on the back. No rag top and a foam-padded-and-chrome after- 
market steering wheel.

- short anecdote - My wife was walking down the street and saw a dog  
chained to a tree, obviously malnourished and scarred from the chain  
around its neck. She knocked on the door and offered the occupant $20  
for the dog. They took it and she took the dog home. - end short  
anecdote -

Maybe the guy offering to buy my bus was just trying to free the bus  
from what he perceived as a neglectful owner. I'm just guessing that  
it looked that way to most anyone who saw me driving it around. Maybe  
that explains the 5k offer, I don't know. Should I have taken it? I  
did end up losing relationships over it - but also had some really  
great memories as well. (i.e. Driving down a back road and a small  
child looking at me from the back window of the car in front of me  
gleaming and waving wildly.)

Yes, I still have the bus and no it doesn't look any better than it  
did then. Well, in some regards it does, but only to me - definitely  
not to my wife. In my defense, I am seeking the help of a counselor/ 
mobile repair mechanic. And I do have a game plan - albeit one that  
comes after finishing the siding on the house and other duties.
