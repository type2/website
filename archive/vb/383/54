Greg,
The 61 most likely has the small nut RGB's. What you need to do is get a 
rear end from a 64+ with the large nut RGB's. Higher gear ratio. I believe 
the 64+ trans also has some higher gearing. You could also get a trans 
rebuilt with a higher ratio ring&pinion. Standard for 64+ was 4.125. I have 
a 3.88. There is also a 3.44 available. A bigger motor is always nice for 
going faster.

Chris
