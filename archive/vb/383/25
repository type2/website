Subject: Free blocks and heat exchangers in CT

Spring cleaning and I just want this stuff gone!  Most of it I got from 
a buddy who moved away 4 years ago, so I know very little about it.

All VW Stuff:


4 engine blocks in various states of disrepair some with cylinders, one 
with flywheel, from busses, type 3's  etc.  No idea if they are reusable

4 sets of heat exchangers some decent, maybe even usable, some very 
rough, no idea what they will fit onto.

various cylinders etc in another box

I can't really answer any questions about it, it is what it is, and 
it's free.  (If you do think it's useful to you, I like beer)

located at 6 grant rd, Bethany CT 06524  Corner of rt 42 and 63  (Look 
for the other crap on the side of Rt 63 with a Free sign)  I'll keep 
this stuff in the garage for now.

First person to pmail me that they will come and pick up ALL OF IT  
ASAP gets it all.  I'll try and check every 1/2 hour  until suppertime  
while I'm continuing the clean out, then we'll see what happens tonight.
