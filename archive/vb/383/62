Subject: The paint is finished .. 

http://www.jangle.us

The paint job is finished, 'cept for the 60's artwork I will add next month 
.. I put up all the far away shots .. now I have to take pictures of the 
HORRIBLE places .. and the body work I paid for but they didn't do ..  The 
worst is yet to come, where I try and get my money back.

Diane
