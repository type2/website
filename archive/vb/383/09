Subject: Good puzzle for you guys

hey guys  I am putting a 58 single cab back on the road for a good  friend of 
mine that has been off the road for probably 15 years . It came with a  bunch 
of NOS parts ,including a bus rear bumper, crank style apron, third brake  
lite decklid, and OE tilt with hoops. He is trading me the bumper and tilt for  
getting the truck road worthy.  All goes good rebuild the motor , fix the  
brakes, get it inspected. . I drive the truck over the weekend to work out any  
bugs. As I am going home the headlite quit. I go well ain't that strange. So  
today I take a look at it and find that the high and low and both hot at the  
same time.So I get my power probe and start checking the circuit and find that  
there isn't any ground to the headlites. So I trace the ground wires and see  
that they run back into the lite wire housing.  I start thinking to myself  
that that is odd,normally they just ground right inside the headlite area. So I 
 go inside the truck and only find the lite wires,NO Ground wires in there at 
 all.,I find that to be real confusing, so I go back out to the headlites and 
 pull on the ground wires and they come out of the factory housing ,still 
looped  together. They had never been hooked up at all. I think I just got punked 
by  some factory worker from 1958  LOL  . One neat thing I did find inside  
the headlite housing was somebody had wrote Blau  with their fingers in the  
factory paint. Just another strange day of working on VWs  later and have  fun
