Subject: info. on rear end

hi, i could use some help,does any one out there know if a  69 ghia rear end 
will  fit on a 61 single cab? and will it help it go faster? it has a 1600 
dp with a webber carb. I think it has a stock rear end right now ,and it 
goes pretty slow!! im hoping this change will help. thanks greg
