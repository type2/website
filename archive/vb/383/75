Odd.  I had the exact same thing happen to me over the 
weekend with my 73 bug.  It happened with my 66 
doublecab about 8 years ago.

Bug - kid offered me 10k.  It's restored, pretty nice, and a 
member of the family.  I'll never get rid of it.  Love the car, 
learned to drive on it, it was my mom's first car, blah blah.
Didn't even consider the offer.

Double cab - next door neighbor's cousin offered me $1,500.
It was in the middle of some heavy work (ok, I had just started 
teardown, which, frustratingly enough, I'm still at about the 
same point) and the kid wanted it bad.  I should have sold it 
with all the stuff I had bought.  I think I would have just 
about broken even.  Although looking back, I'm glad I didn't, 
as I think I'm about ready to restart the project.

Cash only, $1,200.  If you feel like you'd take $1k and feel good 
about the deal, go for it.
