In case one of them rattles loose, it will in turn tighten its neighbour and 
vise versa.
Therefore none of them comes off, gets lost and the wheel ( The gearbox 
shiftrod-coupler in this case) does not loosen.

This proves very helpful in our climate with dirtroads, whether I use the 
big truck or my trusted old, battered Splittie...
