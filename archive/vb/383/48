Subject: Re: [VB] Short Block Cleaning

Hello Seth  First let me ask you does this H block have 6mm or 8 mm  oil pump 
studs?? The 6mm H block is stronger than the 8 mm H  block. The 8  mm H  
block is famous for cracks and pulled head studs. You can fix the  pulled heli 
coiled studs using a timesert or a lock sert. I would recommend  going ahead and 
taking the whole thing apart and checking and redoing the bottom  end while 
you are this close to it . just makes more sense. You know wwhat will  happen 
otherwise Mr Murphy will show up .  :) later  Mark  Dearing
