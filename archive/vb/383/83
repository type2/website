Subject: What colour code is it?

Dear Friends,
I am rubbing down my Bus, to respray it with its original dove-blue colour.
Would anyone of you folks be able to name me the correct VW paint code /
number?

As we have a german automotive paint supplier, who reckons he could supply any
original colour as long as he knows the ( vehicle manufacturer's ) original
code number, i'd like to ask the List-members, if this dove-blue colour is
known to you by number.

Looking forward to hearing from you, I bid you well from an autumly, chilly
Johannesburg in South Africa.
