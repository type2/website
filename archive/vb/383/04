Subject: Seattle body shops

I know there is only a small contingent of listees in the Seattle area, but
I would like to query the group for any positive/negative experiences w/
shops in the Western Washington area.

Let me know:
If you have had experience with paint/body work on an early VW.
How above board the shop is.
Pricing???

Thanks for any input.  My '63 has been sitting for too long with a smashed
nose. :-(

Update:  I bought an early nose, now just have to find a good shop to do the
transplant...
