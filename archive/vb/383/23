I wonder how the headlights were working at all in the first place.  Did
it have the short brown wire from the parking light bulb to the headlamp
ground terminal?  That might explain it; on my '64 the parking light
bulbs have that short brown wire, but the parking light socket is also
designed to ground the bulb to the metal headlamp shell.  That would
provide enough of a ground for the headlights to work, at least until
you hit a real good bump or something.

Maybe they figured that some dealer mechanic would have to diagnose the
headlights before delivery and would get to admire their finger-paint
skillz.  :)
