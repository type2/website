That  should help to keep things tight. Even if the bolts loosen a little, 
they  will only turn a fraction of a revolution and not fall out.   <<




Hi Chris,
Take a look at how you have those safety wired.  You should tie them  in such 
a way as to KEEP TENSION on the bolts so they stay tight!!!

PS Forgot to mention in last post that our bus shifters after re  
bushing/rebuilding only require the tips of thumb and two fingers on the  shift knob to 
shift from gear to gear.  E&B
