Hi Diane,
In vehicles, especially aircraft, rockets,  helicopters, speed  boats, and 
even automobiles one does NOT want threaded fasteners to vibrate  loose.  So to 
keep this from happening the bolt is designed with a  small hole through its 
head OR one just drills a hole (as must be done  through one of the corners of 
the nut to secure it).  
 
In the instance of shift rod coupling bolts you want to run the safety wire  
between the bolt heads in kind of the shape of an "S", but the "S" must be  
flipped so its left is on the right and the right is on the left.
