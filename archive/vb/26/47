Subject: eurotails

Hey All,

Hope everyone had a great weekend.  Got my euro tails in and they're working 
w/ the exception of the right tail light.  I hooked up a jumper from the 
right tailight (thats working fine) to the right...no light. If the bulb is 
fine and the jumper is properly attached to the right does this mean my 
right repro tailight bucket is jank and has a short or something.  Just 
wondering if any list masterminds may have an idea of something (most likely 
obvious) I'm overlooking? I tried to get the tailight w/ the oem wiring 1st 
but thought maybe there was a break somewhere between the 2 lights.

Thanks for all your help,

Eric
