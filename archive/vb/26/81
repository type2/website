Go over all the holes (intake, exhaust, oil fill, etc) and make sure
you have removed any rags/covers/plugs that may have been put in the
holes for storage.

Take out the plugs and squirt some oil down each cylinder.  Turn the
engine over by hand with a wrench on the crank pulley nut, just to
make sure things are cool.

Adjust the valves or at least check the adjustment.  While you're
in there, take a torque wrench to the head studs to make sure they're
to spec.  Check the case half fasteners as well with the torque wrench.

Change the oil.  Once it's in your Bus and running, you might consider
doing a short-time change, like at 500 miles or so, just to make sure
any remaining goo in the engine is gone.

As the other poster suggested, once it's in the Bus, crank it on the
starter with the coil disconnected until the oil light goes out.
Then hook it up and give it a shot...

Good luck!!
