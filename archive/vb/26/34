Subject: APB 59 double cab parts

Hi All,

I've decided I need a better engine lid for the 59 double cab.  Mine has
welded hinges and the prop lid support nut is in the wrong position...
anyone have a nice (or NOS) decklid?  Correct years would be 59-60 but up to
64 will work since I have the correct prop rod already.

Also, I know others have gone before me on this one, but I'm trying to find
any nice original interior panels... and I'm still in need of some original
ferrules and screws....  trades or cash.

Other minutia parts include (nos or original only) an original set of rear
transmission mounts (must have a VW symbol on them), license light bulb
boot, one eyed duck, and a few of those little round rubber bumpers that go
under the front seat.

TIA
David
