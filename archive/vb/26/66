Well.... since you be pointing the finger at this dooood, let me tell the
whole story but in short form.

1. I plunked down $300 deposit to a now defuct listee for a BUILT up trans
that never showed up, nor did my money ever materialize.
(http://www.dolphinsci.com/toddhill.html )
2. City threatened with removal of my DC
3. I threw in a condition unknown, stock 74 thing transaxle and drove it
with the 2L type IV.
4. I got one year on the trans (not a few weeks) before 1st gear broke.
5. Having the city off my back, I pulled the trans and sent it down to
Rancho Performance for the proper rebuild/buildup as originally planned.
(details easily found in the archives)
6. 12K miles later, I'm still glowing and eating sliced bread every day.
:-))

gotta go jump into the DC and blast off to school.
