Subject: Engine bay tin needed HELP

Hi Folks...I am working on a `61 kombi for a friend. 
SOmeone ran a type 3 engine in the bus at one time and
cut the sheet metal on the sides of the engine bay
away.  This is the sides of the engine where the
engine seals fit.  

We desperately need donor pieces to weld in tyo fix
this area...anytin form this area will work...`55
through `62 ish should be great.  I would love to have
it cut all the way to the edge of the compartm,ent. 
This may be a PIA as the frame is welded underneath. 
We want this much metal as I can hide the welds from
underneath by splicing in right above my frame
sections.  We are looking for very clean damage free
pieces.  Willing to pay you for your time.

Please let us know what you have available and price.
Thanks mucho!
Todd
