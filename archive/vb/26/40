Subject: RE: [VB] Upper 3rd or Lower 4th?

I also do allot of city driving, and I keep it in 3rd gear to top out at
40mph, but usually throw it into 4th if I want to do a little
speeding.(which I usually do unless I am in heavy traffic.)  I run a
Non-Stock motor though, and can handle the higher rpms a bit better.

Hey all,

I wind up doing a lot of city driving with speeds right around
40mph.  That's right on the shift point from 3rd to 4th gears.  Typically
is it smarter to run a little slower and stay in 3rd gear (higher engine
rpms, more cooling and all) or toss it up into 4th (lower revs, etc) and
lug it a little but actually do the speed limit?
