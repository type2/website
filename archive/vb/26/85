Does this sound as much like your life as it does like
mine?  Busses do this deliberately to test your
patience.  But just remember, that when it's running
right, there's no better feeling than cruising through
a mountain pass, or down a lonely forest road, or
along in a gentle rain with a dry dashboard, or with a
beautiful sunset shining through your split
windshield.
