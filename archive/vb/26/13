Hi Craig,
Take a oil drain pan and have it handy for any oil that leaks out.  Next rap 
three times with a hammer to loosen the threads of these plugs.  Once you 
have them out check the service or shop manuals for your year engine for the 
proper length stocker springs.  If one of the pressure relief pistons are 
stuck you can use a tap of just the right size to thread into it's skirt and 
pull it out either with the tap or with a bolt of the same thread size if it 
is siezed in place badly.  Eric&Barb
