Subject: charging system trouble pt.4..."The Generator Strikes Back!"

Well, my old voltage regulator must not have been really good, cause 
my generator light is back on. Didn't take long either. I'm really 
getting afraid that my generator might be bad or something. Can 
anyone verify if this is a good way to test your generator while it's 
still in the bus:

-unhook all the wires going from the generator to the voltage regulator
-put the positive side of a voltmeter on the D+ terminal of the generator
-ground the DF wire and the negative of the voltmeter to the generator
-start the engine and check the output of the voltmeter
-should be 12v or above

I did this before and got 13v or so. I made sure to do it quick so as 
not to damage anything. Sound right?

All my local FLAPS so far only seem to carry non-bosch regulators. I 
havn't gone to NAPA yet. Seems they'd probably have one. But I hate 
to throw down the dough if I don't need to. And since I just 
installed this engine after my bus sitting awhile, I hate to pull it 
right out again to have to replace the generator..especially if it's 
good.

I'll keep checking things...maybe there's some way I missed something.
