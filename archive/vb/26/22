Subject: sunroof rails

Hi bus people, A week ago I picked up my first ever sunroof bus. It's a
project bus in need of some body work, deluxe trim, rust repair, etc. But
it's got the hole in the roof so I'm happy. Anyway the sunroof came
rolled up inside the bus, I never knew these were so heavy and had so
many pieces. From what I can figure out looking in the Bentley workshop
manual I'm mainly missing the aluminum guide rails that screw to the bus
body and the "tensioning strip" shown at the top of page A-50 in the
Bentley. If anybody out there has these for sale please let me know. Also
is there an exploded view of a sunroof somewhere on the Internet? So I
could see how everything goes together and if I'm missing anything else.
Thank you.
