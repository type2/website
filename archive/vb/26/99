Subject: re:Dangerous Brakes!

a few years ago, my father in law was enroute from san
diego to yuma,az in his '62pan/'70body baja bug.he
stopped at a rest area 8miles west of el centro, with
no indication of any brake problems. after a quick
rest, he drove to el centro, exited the freeway to get
fuel. the single circuit '62 type brakes lost a wheel
cylinder, down the off ramp he went, quickly,
attempted a right turn at 50mph? and rolled the car
three times. he came away with a scratch on his elbow
(you gotta love a bugs structural design!). i built
him another baja bug, this one got brand new '68
everything for brakes. my wife's '66 deluxe got brand
new '67 everything from ronnie. $150.00 for a dual
circuit master cylinder, doesn't seem like much, for
brake security to me. so much is written here, about
how great vws engineering is, "stock is superior" etc.
and many people futz with/modify/re-engineer/cheap out
on the one system, that if it fails, it can kill you
and others. i am pleased to hear that all survived
their bouts with brake failures, fix 'em right!
