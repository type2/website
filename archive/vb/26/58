Hi Jesus,
50 watts should be plenty.  The stocker headlights only used 50/55 watt bulbs 
and take alot bigger diameter wire to do the job.  The power wire/s to the 
wiper are alot smaller so are designed for much wattage.  Look for voltage 
reducer/s (Often you need two voltage reducers to really drop the voltage 
enough!) that wire inline after your wiper switch which makes it easy to 
mount it out of the way on the upper front of the package tray if you have 
the earlier one speed.  For dual speed wipers install the voltage reducer/s 
before the wiper switch.  Eric&Barb
