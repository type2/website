The magnet idea is still good, though.  I use a home-made one with a small
neodymium button magnet (fierce!  you can put one on either side of your
hand and they'll stay put!) securely fastened on the end of a piece of 1/8
brazing rod.  If the magnet gets within an inch of a steel washer or shim
the washer will leap to the magnet.  Unfortunately, the magnet will also
be attracted equally to steel parts of the engine, but for fishing steel
parts out of non-ferrous places it can't be beat!
