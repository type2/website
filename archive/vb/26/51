That'll give you a pantload. I've had them go a couple of times. Not fun.
Both times it was due to being lazy about keeping the brakes adjusted. I had
wheels that didn't allow access to the adjuster hole on the drum, so I had
to remove the wheels. Tended to put it off too long. That gets the piston
extended out on the slave cylinder so far that it is easy to blow the seal.
I just poked it back in, adjusted and bled and drove on. Never had an M/C
fail, though it is possible. It is a good idea to have your parking brake in
tip top shape, but you gotta keep them brakes adjusted. Glad you made it.
