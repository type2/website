Go to your local auto glass shop with the one that is still good. They can
cut you one for about $40.

it figures. I have replaced nearly every piece of rubber on my 21 window. I
had neglected to do the windsheilds for sometime. But the days or driving
with wet knees and a soaked floor needed to come to an end. I anxiously
awaited the seals along with my other parts for making the bus roadworthy
for my 1800 mile journey to oregon. After struggling with the driver side
for 20 min and realizing I had the seal on backwards, I cursed and carefully
approaced the passenger side. I cut off the old seal and put a little
pressure from the back to get the window out. and CRrrrrak. more cursing.
idle threats to sell the bus, and pacing followed.  not the kind of thing i
needed after a long day of bad work. And so here my bus sits. jacked up 3
feet off the ground with the engine sitting behind it, cause im waiting to
helicoil the head. the trannie still in it, cause i dont have a 46mm 1/2
socket to drop it and change the mounts and input seal. and now a broken
windsheild.

So. does anyone out there have a replacement passenger side window? id
rather not pay the 160+ for the set. Im on a tight budget as I am moving in
under a month, and it seems every time I try to fix something I find
something else wrong.

any help wouldbe greatly appreciated. im tired of calling RMMW. I think they
are getting suspicious.

I will sing and dance for parts.
(the singing may be sub-par, but dancing is unique)

sigh.
