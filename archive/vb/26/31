Bart,
  I had a neighbor make a nice wood box with no front or rear to hold my =
radio/cd player and I wedged it in the tray to the right of the pod. I =
guess I could bolt it down and make it more secore. I wish a company would =
make a fully remote controlled radio that could be put anywhere and a =
little remote to fit on the wheel or dash that could be slipped into a =
pocket or hidden. There's no reason to see the front of the stereo, but =
they sell more if it's stolen I guess. Radio block off plates are around =
and even repro'd, or put in a cheapo so the thief won't look for a nice =
stereo.=20

My DC has a type 1 tranny put in by a PO. They welded in bug swing arms, a =
major job. They also put in a '69 bus front beam that had been cut and =
turned to match the lower rear end. I'm about 2" lower than stock and =
scrapes the driveway when loaded. We can find a lift somewhere and take =
some pics. It was done 10 years ago or so.=20
=20
Type 4 is the way to go for more power and retain reliability. Search on =
Joe Cali, Jack Raby and Oregon Performance Products. Scott Fraser on the =
list has pics & notes on his T4/FI engine.  Joe sells a book on the =
conversion, Jack builds engines and OPP sells an upright conversion kit =
for the T4. I've got most of the engine parts and the OPP shroud scattered =
around the garage. Even have some 914 heads, P&C's for it. It's the next =
project after the camper is finished and the EV has new batteries and =
boxes.=20
