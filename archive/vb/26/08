Subject:  RE: [VB] Bulb #

Greetings All,

Original instrument bulbs were 6V 1.2W.

Hella makes a 12V 2W number is J122

For alternate manufacturers
any bulb 12V 1.2 to 2W with a BA7 base will replace

I am in the process of changing from 6V. to 12V.  All of the
bulbs are pretty much self-explanatory except the tiny twist-in
dash light bulbs.  What is the bulb number of the 12V. version
of this bulb so I can get some at the local FLAPS?
Thanks muchly!!
