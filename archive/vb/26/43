Lou,
For every near miss, there might be many crunched vehicles, rollovers and =
such from failed wheel cylinders, flex hoses and just rust.  It's easy to =
remedy and should be unless the brake is used only when unloading it from =
the trailer. You should have the e-brake in good condition and also know =
how to downshift in an emergency even if you have quadruple circuit =
brakes.=20

I'm putting together a '66 Riviera camper that will go to my brother in =
Anderson Valley, CA. Plenty of steep, curvy roads there, so I'm putting in =
a dual MC. Got a nice brass T from a Bay. It was mounted on the left side =
just in front of the engine. I'll be using the Eric&Barb technique from =
www.type2.com. Will take notes and post.=20

After fixing the rust on the above beast's windshield lip, I got out the =
Henry's and painted the edges of the windshield, the outside lip of the =
body frame and installed the string. One went in with a few pops and =
cracking sounds, but no visible cracks in the glass. (helpful hint... =
disconnect the horn before doing the driver's side, it'll keep your =
pushing helper from leaving the ground.) Then went to the passenger side =
and pushed in _lightly_ before starting to pull the cords. Cracked a =
corner! Now I'll have to find a place in town with .110" laminated glass. =
Need to order 3, to pay back the 21w and replace the .180" thick one and =
the one I cracked while removing.=20
