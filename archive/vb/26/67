I did the heal-toe thing with my RIGHT foot.
Starting on a the middle of a hill and then proceeding in a continuous manner to
the top is one thing .

Try starting at the bottom of the hill, and move two feet, stop, move two feet
stop, move two feet stop until you reach the top.  Total time for this trip was
about 30 minutes. (no lie!)  If I stopped for any length of time to allow a gap
to develop, I got crazed drivers all the way down the hill honking at me.

As far as practicing for a run like this on a deserted hill, I doubt anybody has
the perseverance to do this for the 30 minutes that we endured.

It has returned to normal operation.
