Subject: 6v wipers

Hey there, I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do about using a 6v
wiper motor in my 59 bus' current 12v system. I'd like to keep the stock
switch/motor configuration. There are some companies out there that sell a
voltage drop switch, but it looks really ugly (not that my bus is easy on
the eyes) and it's the turn kind; I'm fond of the pull type :)
I've looked into voltage drops, but they seem to not be able to handle more
than 50 watts - at least the ones I've found.

...any clues or suggestions.

Thanks alot!
