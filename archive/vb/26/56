When this type 4 engine discussion first came up, I emailed the grand
guru Bob Hoover to find out what he thought. One dooood on the list had
already done the conversion and had glowing revues that it was the best
thing since sliced bread. And it sounded so nice, all that power and
reliability. But then Bob Hoover threw his big ole monkey wrench into
the gears. He said that due to the increased torque that the
transmission would not hold up unless modifications where made to it.
Low and behold, a few weeks later the same dooood posted that his
transmission now had a crack in it. So Bob was right again.

If I were to do it, I would replace the transmission too. Though it is
Bob's opinion that the whole thing is unnecessary. That one simply needs
to build a good quality type 1 engine, properly balanced. And,
remembering back to a buddy of mines fully loaded 64 camper with four
people cruising the mountains of Virginia, I believe he is right. A good
strong 1600, or at best 1776, should do just fine for power, reliabilty
and economy. Of course, that's just my opinion.

Now I wonder if some of the fine logical and insightful people on the
list can read that and find a way to infer that I am a racist. He he.
