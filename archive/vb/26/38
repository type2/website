Subject: RE: [VB] dizzy shaft shim in case   :P

3 engines with broken camshafts. That's what happens, when, where or how
long it takes is a crap shoot. The washers are hardened and if they get
between the crank and cam gear, it's bye bye cam. I have taken a few engines
apart that had waded up balls of dizzy drive washer in them and still ran
fine, till the rod bearings went away, but that's another story.

Subject: [VB] dizzy shaft shim in case :P


well, while pranking with fuel pump pressure, etc i was pulling the dizzy
shaft in order to remove a shim. NATURALLY i dropped one (ok, TWO) in
there!!!!
this is bad cuz
a) these shims are getting hard to find and
b) there are shims in the case!!! :P

i tried everything short of pulling the motor and shaking the things out
and next breaking open the case, but a neighbor who used to work for chick
iverson (he really did!) said to just button it up and let it rip!
ummmmmm.........

ok.

now, his rationale was that the shims would either stay put or end up in
the oil screen. and hey, if it blew up, i had a REAL reason to take apart
the case anyways.

so we did. after about two minute i heard a sound like a steel baseball
card in spokes. =O  it went away. did it again. went away.
i'll be damned if the motor don't idle better than ever!!

so, my fuel pressure dropped by nearly 3/4 lb, and the motor is actually
quieter (it used to have a highspeed knocking from near the dizzy gear), so
i definitely opened the  clearance between the case and the dizzy gear, and
they say too loose is better than too tight.
but what damage did i likely do to the rest of the motor? the cam gear is
aluminum, which should suffer from the steel shim, right?  any suggestions
for near-term maintenence items - i intend to change the oil and look for
pieces.

if nothing else, it shows how resilient these motors are............
