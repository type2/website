Subject: Upper 3rd or Lower 4th?

Hey all,

I wind up doing a lot of city driving with speeds right around 
40mph.  That's right on the shift point from 3rd to 4th gears.  Typically 
is it smarter to run a little slower and stay in 3rd gear (higher engine 
rpms, more cooling and all) or toss it up into 4th (lower revs, etc) and 
lug it a little but actually do the speed limit?
