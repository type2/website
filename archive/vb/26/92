Go here for three pictures of Steve Young's 66 dormobile with an SO44 interior.THis bus was brought into the states by a service person that was stationed in Europe.

Todd S can add more to the story of this Bus I believe.

Unfortunately the webmaster does not routinely scan the type2 list, only 
the vintagebus one (Matt, you need to learn to dig the fat chicks!). 
Please get with Matt Roberds, address in the header.

We applaud this sort of thing, and listees please bear in mind that that 
we *always* have space for the results of bus research projects of all 
sorts (well, please try not to flagrantly violate copyright laws, but 
other than that...). Seems like there used to be more people willing to 
do these things than there are now. You have a tremendous amount of disk 
space, bandwidth, and server resources available, and y'all are paying 
for it, best to use it!

I am very tired of the televised Men on the Street proclaiming that some 
of our freedoms must be abridged to fight terrorism. That itself 
terrifies me. We must have more freedom now, not less. Liberty entails 
risks, but its contraries ensure disaster.
