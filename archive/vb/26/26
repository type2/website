If you have safari windows, I think overhead is a good choice. I blocked 
off my air intake vents on the inside, permantly closed the flap, then 
mounted a Tachometer up there. I've been so happy with it that I think I 
might mount some more guages. I had people say it would be hard to read up 
there, but I quite like it. I ran the wires up through the side windscreen 
post and drilled a tiny hole very forward in the side of the overhead vent 
to run them through. You'd never know it's there unless you really got in 
there and looked hard. I think a stereo up there would be great if it'll 
fit. I always save these overhead vent covers now for this very reason. 
Keep a nice uncut one for replacement later if you want, cut the other one 
for use right now. You can even bend up a piece of sheet metal to fit if 
you don't want to cut your original and don't have an extra. Just ideas.

I say pull the cover and do some test fitting.
