There is a system made that is hidden and operated by remote control.  Go to www.customautosound.com and click on the link for "Secret Audio" on the left.  I will be trying this in my SC one day.  It works off of a radio frequency remote control so that the remote doesnt have to have a direct "line of sight" to the unit, i.e. it should all work nicely mounted behind the seat(s) of a bus.

I wish a company would make a fully remote controlled radio that could be put anywhere and a little remote to fit on the wheel or dash that could be slipped into a pocket or hidden. There's no reason to see the front of the stereo, but they sell more if it's stolen I guess. Radio block off plates are around and even repro'd, or put in a cheapo so the thief won't look for a nice stereo.
