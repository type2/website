Subject: Shannon, NQ, and Brian's Bug

I found a disk in the camera that had 4 last photos that were taken at Bry's
while we were working on the bus.  The 2 best pix of Shannon the greasy
woman and I working over the front end of Bry's bus are to be found here
plus pictures that I just now took of Brian's bug in my driveway.  He's out
there working on it so I better get out there and help him.  Notice the
grease fittings in one of the photos that I installed on Brian's zerks for
him.  It's makes those sealed units greaseable again!  For reference, this
message is being cross posted to vintagebus and vintagvw so some of you
getting this will wonder who all these people are.  Well, look at the
photos. :-)

Enjoy the pix.
