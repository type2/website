Subject: RE: [VB] Dangerous Brakes!

Ironically, I had a system failure after traversing Mingus on the way TO
Jerome. I was pulling into my camping spot by Ronnie and the pedal went
all the way down. I grabbed the ebrake in time to avoid hitting his
(award-winning) Deluxe.

It turned out that I had done my Wolfgang spindle install incorrectly
and both front lines were rubbing on the kingpins. Bad move on my part.
I replaced both lines and redid the install so they would not rub. No
fault of anyone other than myself, but I can't say how blessed I felt
that it didn't happen on the way down the pass. I'd be a shiny spot on
the guardrail otherwise. All of the other parts are new on it, which I
can't recommend more...

Glad to hear that you remain safe.

  Hi Everyone,
 I'm asking for your assistance.  Have you or someone you know, had a 
brake failure, including any of these, wheel cylinder, master cylinder,
soft 
hose or metal line on a VW that only has a single circuit master
cylinder?  
Please respond to the list as we all need to know the facts.
 My wife and I suffered a blown left rear wheel cylinder while returning

from Jerome last weekend.  We had just emerged from the Mingus Mountain 
road which is a 'white' knuckle road to begin with and were driving at
45 MPH, I had to slow down so I was on the brakes firmly and pow, to the
floor goes the pedal, the parking brake was not going to stop us in time
and we avoided 
hitting the bus in front of us by inches by swerving off the road, just
missing blockades along the road.  Fate was with us at that moment.  I
have been driving old VWs for 15 years and this was my first failure of
brakes. All the brake equipment was replaced just one year ago with
Varga parts.  This event could easily have killed myself and wife,
please respond with any info.
  Thankyou,
    Lou & Liz in Havasu
