Subject: RE: [VB] Burnt Clutch??

Scott writ:
"It was not the time to find out that the hand-brake needed adjusting and
could not fully hold the DC from slipping backward. What fun and excitement
it was, bumper to bumper traffic, no way to bail out, no place to bail out
to. Before I got to the top of the hill, you could smell the clutch. By the
time I got to the top, you would swear from the smell, that flames were
roaring out the back of the DC."

Let me guess... 009 dizzy.

From this description I can only assume that you were "holding" the bus in
place on the hill with the clutch and gas.  This is a sure fire way not to
have a clutch last very long.  Try "heal and toe" driving with your left
foot partially on the gas and brake for hills.  Also practice on deserted
hills, there is no reason you should not be able to use the brakes regularly
on and no clutch, you just need to be familiar with your bus. 

I agree that if you just "glazed" the clutch it will come back to proper
usage after some miles.
