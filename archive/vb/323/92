Subject: Re: Rebuilt Spindles and Center Pin!

Another couple quick/easy questions:

Spindles are on, everything seems good, very tight....link pins accepted
grease through the nipples readily, but the king pins are so tight that I
can't get any grease to go in....should I worry?

The old center pin is out, bushings are out (thanks to George Lyle and
Michael Pjetraj on the subject at the TypeII.com Library), and the new
bushings are in.  The upper bushing required pressing with the big C-clamp,
but the bottom one went in smoothly by hand.  Not right, I suspect!  Anyway,
I am reaming the bushings, and run into two problems:

1.  The reamer runs into the shift rod before getting all the way through.
Is this normal?  Should I remove the rod?

2.  With the center pin kit, there is a small white rubber O-ring.  Not
mentioned anywhere, and the old assembly did not have one.  Where does it
go?

Thanks a bunch!

P.S.  To avert much pain and anger, remember that there is a locking tab on
the swing lever bolthead!  (Surprise surprise!)
