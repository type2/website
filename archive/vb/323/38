I wonder if having an "Ape Bar" extension like on mine would give the

wow!!!!

Guy I know drove a bus around for years with an old cut glass doorknob
as
shift knob.  never heard of that.   Another guy, friend who moved to New
Mexico
also had a cut glass shift knob... never heard of that.   Must have been
a
funny angle or somthing.
 I think they look neat.
