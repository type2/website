Subject: RE: [VB] heavy shift knobs

As for using heavier than usual shift knobs, anyone know what the stock
weight is? I currently have a billiard ball (#15) on my shift lever, as
the original knob broke long ago, and I'd hate to think I'm damaging
something. It's a perfect size and shape for me, though, and would be a
shame to give it up, but I don't want to tear anything up. Any more info
on that?
thanks,
