I guess this makes sense. But does anybody know how much
weight is needed to cause noticeably accelerated wear? The
reason I ask is that my bus has had the shift lever replaced
with a baywindow lever and knob, both bigger and heavier
than the splittie items.

It was like that when I bought it in 1993. The bay shift
lever is easier to hand than the shorter splittie lever, but
I don't like the longer throw. Add to that misadjustment of
the shift plate making it difficult to find second on
shifting down (easy to find fourth or reverse GHURRR!!!,
OUCH!).

But when I went to replace it with a splittie shift lever
11 years ago I found that the mounting plate that is usually
bolted to the floor with two 8mm bolts had been welded to
the floor by some DPO/mechanic.

I quickly learned the knack of crunch-free shifting and have
lived with it ever since. I figured I would cut the shift
lever out when something down there wore out or broke, which
hasn't happened yet. The bus had unknown mileage on an
unknown transmission when I got it, and I've put 100,000km
on this trans so far with no signs of excessive wear and
tear, other than replacing RGB bearings a few years ago.

Just wondering ...
