My '67 Westy is one of those shiny ones....

or was as  I skilfully re-create the patina. The sand blasted front bumper,
the axe falling off the roof rack and putting a paint chip on the rear
bumper, .....the Westy rack gutter chips, .....the bungee cord ding on the
side panel (thought it was the long one, not the short one when I released
it!)..... Once the first paint scratch goes in the tension lessens and
touch-up paint is your friend. Having fun driving and camping.....

Or as Jay Leno says, restore it to 100 points.. drive it and take it back
down to 50 points..... and start the process all over again.
