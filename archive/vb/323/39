Subject: '61 Double Cab engine

Yesterday I was able to borrow a trailer after work to bring my truck 
home. I drove it onto and off of the trailer. When I was backing into 
the carport I saw tons of white smoke. Darn. Looks like it's the 
engine for sure.

Today after work I got after it and yanked the engine. I tore it down 
the the "longblock". All the tin, exhaust, carb, intake, ect. is off. 
Got it down to the heads.

I'm going to wait 'til tomorrow to tear into it. I'm hoping it'll be 
a bad piston or something. This is a beater motor. Actually was 
picked up off the ground in a field. They slapped a rebuilt carb and 
a muffler on it and fired it up. Darn thing ran smooth. Has pretty 
much continued to run smooth since I've owned the truck. And I drive 
it to work most every day.

So we'll see tomorrow. I'm resisiting a complete teardown, but keep 
hearing E & B wispering their advice in my ear. So maybe I'll yank it 
all apart and at the least clean things up, and make sure nothing is 
too bad in there. I could always slap in some new bearings ect. 
Really need the truck running and don't want to mess with it for 
quite a few more years. Just keep it a running "beater".

We'll see what I find this weekend.
