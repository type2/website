Subject: Re: [VB] Electrical Question on my '67.... Solved

Removed the radio and the dash tray to do some clean up work on my ground
wires to see if that would solve the problem. All to repair that stuck green
turn signal indicator in the speedo.

So after much tinkering, still no progress. Until with the turn signal
flasher still stuck ...... I decide to tap the outside casing of the NOS 9
pin relay I put in last year. The flasher starts working again!!

As they say, putting an NOS nine pin relay may not solve the problem as it
is just as likely to pick up moisture and corrison internally off the shelf.
Popped in another replacement nine pin and problem is now solved.

So decide to close up shop for the night.... go to move my Volvo on to the
driveway and the driver door handle breaks internally....

The usual trade one mechanical problem for another kind of night............
