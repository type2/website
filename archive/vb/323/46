Subject: Upper shock bolt replacement, '59 panel

Hi all,

A few days ago I wanted to fix the clunking in the front
end of my '59 panel.  I have had troubles with the shock
absorber bolts coming loose so I looked them over.  They
weren't loose but the rubber in the ends of the shocks had
shrunk enough to allow the shocks to move around
enough to make noise.

I decided to take the shocks off  to examine the problem
and when I went to remove the upper shock bolt on the
passenger side the bolt broke where the unthreaded part
transitions to the threaded part.  I looked carefully at the
piece of bolt stuck in the hole and decided that I could drill
the it out and then put a bolt/nut combination through
the shock and body mounting hole.  I didn't have any
trouble drilling out the hole in the body so that the threaded
part is the same size as the un-threaded part of the hole.

The problem comes when trying to select a bolt with the
correct diameter to fit through the hole.  I was able to find
a bolt at the hardware store (12mm) that is *almost* the
correct size but slightly smaller in diameter than the original
bolt so there is a little clunking when I go over bumps.

Does anyone know what the correct diameter of this bolt is
and/or if it might be reasonable to try to shim the bolt diameter
with some brass shim stock that I have (.003" thick)?

Thanks,
