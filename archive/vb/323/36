wow!!!!  

Guy I know drove a bus around for years with an old cut glass doorknob as 
shift knob.  never heard of that.   Another guy, friend who moved to New Mexico 
also had a cut glass shift knob... never heard of that.   Must have been a 
funny angle or somthing.  
 I think they look neat.

was being focused right in the middle of the seat by the glass knob, like a 
magnifying glass!
