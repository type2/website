Hi Tom,
The above is incorrect!  Sounds like you need to tap the upper bearing into 
the bore and then carefully file/deburr the opening of the bore to remove any 
lip there that could be sticking the bearing there.  This bore is supposed to 
be a slip in fit and if it is a press in fit, the bore has been damaged or the 
wrong fit bearing has been used.  The latter will require grinding out the 
bearing in pieces and/or using a bearing puller.
