Subject: Re: [VB] Stuck RGB Halves

I had this happen once... well actually the bearings on that box wer kinda 
toast, which I heard when driving.  grumble rumble grumble.  When I pulled the 
RGB half off, it turned out the thrashed UO bearing stayed in th outer half, at 
least the outside part of the bearing did, and the ball beaings dropped out, 
the inner ring staying on th axle shaft.   The circlip was bent up and fell 
out, and the groove for the circle was worn off, requiring me to get a 
replacement axle shaft.   I blame worn bearings in my case, though.

the bearing is a press fit, meaning it will stick a bit, but not much. 
Actually sometimes 'oress fits' seem a bit tighter than I'd think they should be.   
I'd tap it  carefully apart, alternating sides.  if it's messed up in there, 
nothing you can do from outside.

That's when I realized what had hung up when I was separating the case 
halves.  The top bearing appeared to have been stuck in the RGB half and 
when I forced the halves apart, the circlip broke, leaving the bearing 
stuck in the RGB half. 
Tonight I made to pull that outer RGB half and found it hanging up after 
separating about a 1/4".  I'm not real anxious to repeat my previous 
performance and end up with a less than useful RGB half shell.
