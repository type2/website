Subject: Re: Ignition switch or starter?

Y'all,

Well it appears that consensus is to clean up the contacts and check all the
wires.  I did that, and in the last 10 starts, it is working... silly problems
like this are obnoxious, but I guess a part of our lives with these wonderful
old machines.

Thank you all for your feedback.
