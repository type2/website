Back in the eighties you used to be able to get clear Lexan knobs with
decals of various brands of cars. I have an old scratched one with a
blue and white VW logo in a drawer someplace and there is a red and
white logo one with a pony on my brothers 66 Mustang right now.

Hi Ian,
We hate to rain on your parade, but using glass as a shift knob is a bad

idea, unless you can make it wiegh the same as the stock plastic shift
knob.  We
have seen VWs with solid glass door knobs used in this way and the
tranny
shifting forks in the tranny get worn out much sooner due to the extra
wieght.
Even in the owners manuals, year after year they state it is not a good
idea to
use the shifter as a hand rest for the same reason!
