Subject: Electrical Question on my '67....

The turn signal indicator on the speedometer is "freezing" and not flickering
on green on right hand turns. Also does the same occasionally on left hand
turns.

When this does happen the turn signals are still fully functional and doing
their thing on the exterior. One suggestion is that this problem is from the
31 a/b circuit leading to the ground on the wiper motor as the final culprit.
So before I take the radio out and drop the package tray are there any other
ideas....

Also cleaned the turn signal indicator lelectrical contacts and re-greased
mechanical... works really smooth now. Also cleaned the
contacts/bulbs/connections on the front turn signals. Cleaned up the battery
ground and also replaced body to transmission ground.

None of this has changed the problem.... but I was basically wanting to go
thru all the electrical connections and clean grounds up anyway as the Westy
was put on the road last month.
