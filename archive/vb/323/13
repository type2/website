Subject: Re: [VB] Driving busses (was: Long trip report)

Mine is rusty in places, but I love it more than anything (except my kids, of
coarse) and drive it just about every day. I used to have the 70 Westy and it
was my only car, so yeah, I drove it rain or shine, freezing or sweating.
After the fire, I bought a cheap Cabriolet until I could get another bus... I
still have the Cab, but I still drive the bus more, that's how much I love my
splitty... I guess that's why it's so annoying that teenagers keep asking me
if I'm "selling my van"... does it have a "for sale" sign in the window, ya
little dork??? I'm going to put a sign on the back saying "NO, I'm not selling
my "van"! Get your own! www.thesamba.com "... think that'll help? Probably
not, but oh well...
