Years ago when they were available I used to get 83mm P/S sets and bore
the case for the bigger cylinders and put in a 69mm crank and 1500 SP
heads and intake. Bumped up the HP a little but also forced me into a
larger tin set since the engine was now the wider size of the 1500. I
kept it 6 volt and retained the original flywheel.

Got the engine completely tore down. Have to say I'm a little
disappointed I didn't find anything horrible. Cam, crank, rods,
lifters, pistons, cylinders all look fine. I need a new set of rings
for sure. Nothing is broken, just worn.
