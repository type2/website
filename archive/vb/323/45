Subject: Bus Lesson

I just got back from my Bus guy's shop. My son and I pulled our 66's
engine and tranny.The tranny needs to go back to the rebuilder.I posted
earlier
about doing this myself for the first time. I decided to pay my mechanic to
do it,
but really he supervised the whole thing. I was surprised how EZ it was.We
started
at 8:30 to 8:45 and I was home at 11:45. I could not have done it that quick
here at home.DUH
I used his air wrech a few times, and had to use a rear hub puller for the
pass. side.It looked like a
giant steering whell puller, very handy.I had read MUIR'S book last night,
but have a pro there
was really great.I think it is a real good $200 lesson/investment. He was
able to actually work
on other vehicles, while we spun wrenches.All and all a very good
experience.I hope
putting it back together is as smooth. Thanks for all ya'll's previuos imput
