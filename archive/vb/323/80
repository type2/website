Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Wrong voltage regulator / longer generator

that generator if for 68-71 busses. 
basically everything that touches the generator is
specific to that generator, minus the fan. the fan
hub, backing plates, and front pulley are all unique,
and all need to be used together to get proper belt
alignment. the fan hub is "stubby", the backing plates
are dished, and the pulley (rear half) is cast iron
and the (front half) is stamped steel and they are a
balanced unit. it also uses a different voltage
regulator (38amp) than a type 1.
you may want to check out these pics of how things
*don't* line up if you don't have the correct parts.
