It's tore down enough I pretty much wanna yank the heads and look at them 
and the pistons and cylinders. I can check the rods then too. I'm pretty 
sure once I yank the heads all will be revealed.

I've driven the truck with this engine for almost every work day for a 
year. REALLY smooth running little engine. I might have been kinda hard on 
it. I rev it high and push it a little. It's hauled lots of lumber and 
concrete ect. That's what it's for though, right!?!?!

I can't complain about the engine. For being revived after laying on the 
ground in a field for who knows how long, I'd say it did me pretty good. So 
I don't mind tearing into it and fixing what's broke.
