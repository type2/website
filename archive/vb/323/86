Subject: Rebuilt Spindles and Center Pin!

Hi All,

I am doing something I have never done before, and it is both fun, scary,
and a PITA.  Fun is when it come apart easily, and I can see how it works.
Scary is when it doesn't come apart easily, and I wonder what's wrong (like
getting the spindle off), PITA is handling greasy parts that don't want to
mate just so.

I'm talking about the fact that the offset of my trailing arms being 9mm,
and that uses lots of shims in places so the freaking linkpin dustcaps don't
go on all the way (they are next to impossible to start
anyway...suggestions?)

I suspect that my trailing arms on the side I was hit *might* be bent.  They
seem sorta important.  Anyone hear of these things breaking?

Now I go to the driver's side, where it wasn't hit, and hopefully things
slide to gether much easier.

It is SO much fun pressing (tapping) link pin bushings in!

Then, it is my first center pin and bushing replacement.  I hope it goes
well, cuz I've got three center pin kits, and a rental reamer, and I want to
make the most of it....

Greasy bussing!
