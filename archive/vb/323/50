Subject: RE: [VB] '61 Double Cab engine

Got the engine completely tore down. Have to say I'm a little 
disappointed I didn't find anything horrible. Cam, crank, rods, 
lifters, pistons, cylinders all look fine. I need a new set of rings 
for sure. Nothing is broken, just worn. Probably need to hone the 
cylinders while I'm at it. But they are usable. I will price 40hp 
piston/cylinder set and see if it makes sense to buy a new set while 
I've got this motor tore apart.

Heads were lame. Looks like seat on intake #3 is sinking. One of 'em 
on #4 is getting that way as well, can't remember which.

Heads don't match. One has been cut for different compression.

So I definatly need a new set of heads. My buddy will let me look 
through his cores and see if there is a set for down and dirty 
rebuild. Or I can price a new set. Somehow I figure a new set isn't 
gonna be available ect.

So nothing glaring in the engine. My buddy asked me if I checked in 
the muffler for something that might have been causing "the rattling 
sound". No, I didn't.

Inside of case looks pretty darn clean. #3 rod bearing has a little 
play. So cracking the case is a toss up. I guess at least I know 
what's going on in there new.

So....new bearings all around, new rings, maybe new piston/cylinder 
set, rebuilt heads.

Not too bad. Better now than later when something tears it all up and 
I gotta replace everything.

Of course I still need to check spec on everything, but looks good so far.
