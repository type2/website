Subject: Fans in fan housing..

Hi everyone,

I turned up two different fans that bolt to the forward end of the generator
and reside inside the fan housing to move air to the P & C's.  Can any experts
guide me towards the correct application for each by my description below?

Both fans have the same outer diameter.  One fan has 28 individual "blades"
and the other has 16 blades.  The "thickness" of the fans at the outer blade
ends are almost the same when measured with calipers.  The 16 blade fan is
30mm and the 28 blade fan is about 31.5mm thick when measuring the outside.

I'm guessing that the 16 blade fan is for earlier motors like a 36 or 40 hp
fan housing, and maybe the 28 blade fan is for earlier 1500/1600 motors?
Didn't the fans get thicker (like 34mm or so) for the doghouse fan housings?My
1972 Type 1 VW parts manual describes 3 different part numbers for fans, but
no good description of the physical differences.  So I thought I'd test a
engine experts knowledge...

Bill
