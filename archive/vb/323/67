Subject: Busses on the Move

A few days ago I was heading west on Interstate 80
outside Auburn CA (near Sacramento) when what to my
wonder should appear, but a car hauler loaded to 
the gills with camper busses heading east!

They had 4 Vanagon and 1 loaf, 1 unknown year, all 
campers, and two bugs. They were not all Westies 
either. Someone now has a nice collection of campers. 

One of them the earlier ones could have been 
a split, it was hard to see them clearly on the 
double decker hauler.

Really, it wasn't a hallucination, my daughter 
confirmed the sighting.
