I'm going to boast ...

My 75 Fleetline panel "Ratmobile" is nice and shiny now
after a quick and dirty hammering and respray, a 60 point
"resto" that I'll let slide back to 50 ;-) Before that it
was a rat looker before I'd ever heard the term, since
11/1993 when we were rear-ended by a double-decker bus. It's
always been a daily driver and occasional road tripper. I've
driven it 100,000km.

My 63 Dormobile "Polepole" is in original condition bar a
few missing bits and stock mechanical upgrades. Original
paint is faded and patched up with rattle can. There is well
repaired collision damage to right front (leaded, no epoxy
filler), although the RH (driver's) door frame is a few mm
too narrow and there's a warped bit on the dash. It's rust
free apart from under the windscreens. Fire damage in engine
bay. I use it for long road trips and occasional commuting
and I've driven it 49,000 miles (nearly 80,000km).

The 75 Fleetline Kombi "Zebi" that I drove across Africa
also had a quick and dirty respray in white (over flaking
DPO metallic magenta ACKKK!!) and zebra stripes that I hand
painted with a brush. It too had collision damage, having at
some time in its past fallen over onto its passenger side,
with associated visible repairs/damage and corrosion. I
drove it 30,000km in a mix of city commuting and
cross-country road tripping, before driving it another
32,000km from Cape Town to Germany in 2001/02.

My first bus, a 75 Fleetline panel "Green Machine" (RIP) was
also a brush-painted rat looker long before the term was
coined, also with serious collision damage -- PO fell asleep
at the wheel on a road trip and left the road and hit a
tree. She and the bus survived, but the whole front right
quarter of the bus was replaced with same from a parts bus.
We were T-boned by a 19 year old punk running a red light in
1992, before which we had covered about 50,000km of
commuting and road tripping together.

That's almost 300,000km driving at the wheel of a split bus
in 14 years. And the 100% collision record of this little
bus collection should give you some clue about the standard
of South African driving.

There's not much of a bus "scene" in South Africa and I've
never seen a lowered bus here (have heard of a couple). I
wouldn't dream of lowering a bus and I can't imagine why
anyone would (and I've heard all the "reasons"). I'm more
likely to *raise* a bus ... or how abut a syncro conversion?
*All* the above buses have been used to cover tracks and
trails that would normally only be open to 4x4s, and my
splitties have shown me many parts of this country and this
continent that only a privileged few have experienced.

One day I'll do a proper restoration on one of my buses,
either the Dormobile or my 57 Kombi (never been hit,
woohoo!) that I've driven only 100km in 12 years. Meantime I
spend too much time doing maintenance and mechanical repairs
to have time for making the buses look shiny ;-)
