Hi Greg,
That would be the Euro only sold pre-1968 SO-44 and according to other 
sources the post-1967 SO-69 Westfalia camper interiors.  Think this interior started 
no earlier than 1964 and continued through the end of bus production in 1979. 
 Try searches with SO-44 and SO-69 for these campers and thier owners who 
should have measurements.
