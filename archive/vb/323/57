Hi Rex,
Unless your P&C have 1,000 or less miles on them since new or you can find a 
set of over sized new pistons and rings, it is best to just buy a new set of 
P&Cs.  
  Hmm, something we have wanted to try is installing a 1500/1600 cast 
counterwieght 69mm or perhaps longer stroke crankshaft.  Have a set of 40 HP rods 
thinned down to fit the crank and install 77 or even big bore 40 HP 83mm P&Cs.  
Then to remove the restriction of the small diameter 40HP intake manifold 
either make dual carbs or better yet a Judson supercharger.
