Subject: alternator emergency

Hello all, 
 Today my alternator pulley cut a groove into the cover plate of my new Super 75 amp alternator. The pulley then exploded off the shaft into two pieces which thankfully did no damage other than a gash in the air cleaner intake. I found a replacement pulley and learned how to avoid this in the future by shimming the pulley out from the alternator. HOWEVER, no one locally has a new cover plate for the alternator.  

Does anyone out there have one or know where to get one for an  AL82X Bosch alternator? The part number cast inside mine reads: 9 121 080 279 
If you can help, can you e-mail me asap? We are staying with my family in Delaware, and need it to get home. 

Thanks much!
