Hi Curt,
We removed our's after temporarily installing a spare fuse box to keep the 
wiring in its place.  
  Are you using any piggyback two for one clips?
Only where absolutely needed.  One could work out the clips and replace 
single wire clips with double, hopefully from damaged fuse boxes for parts.
