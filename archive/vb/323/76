Didn't work on the engine this weekend.

Got back into it today after work.

Pulled the crank bearings and found a crack in 2 of the journals 
going from front to back on one of the halves of the engine case. So 
I'm trashing the case. Not gonna build the 40hp engine. I'll spend my 
time and money on a dual port 1600 core engine out of my stash 
instead. Will make more sense in the end anyway.

I've got 3 other 40hp engines around... 2 of 'em are complete. I'll 
save the good parts off this one in case I need 'em with one of those 
later on.

  I'm not really into the 40hp engines, just figured if I could do a 
quick fix it might be worth it. Can't, so would rather spend time and 
money on the bigger engine. Easier for me to find parts for the more 
common engine and the bus would like the extra power. Just will make 
more sense for my purposes. I really wasn't looking forward to 
spending ANY money...and even too much time...getting the 40hp engine 
back on the road. So this really worked out better for me. I'm 
actually a little happy. Gives me a good excuse to "upgrade".
