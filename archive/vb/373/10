Subject: What to do?

Hi All,

            Over at a buddy's house today and started up my 63 and he noticed a miss. We started checking the spark and found that #4 was not firing and come to think of it I did notice a decrease n power. Further investigation found that there was spark getting to the plug and we installed a brand new Bosch W8AC which was gapped to .026. Still #4 was not firing. Bus was smelling really rich too. We decided the rout I should take was to do a valve adjustment and go from there. Now this bus is new to me, about a month, and so I was itching to take the valve cover off to see what I could see and low and behold there was the #4 intake pushrod wedged in next to the rocker arm. I then took off the rocker shaft and extracted the push rod and noticed it was bent, also oil smells like gas and is thin.

Is the fix as simple as getting a new pushrod and bolting the rocker shaft back up and adjusting the valves? Or is this something much bigger?
