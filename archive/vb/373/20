Subject: RE: [VB] What to do.

After closer inspection I could not determine any cause for the push rod coming out except for extreme valve lash. The adjuster screws are severely worn and I doubt that they had been adjusted in some time by PO. Adjuster nuts were on very tight. Inspected the rocker arms and found no discrepencies. Even took them down to my FLAPS, that have alot of VW experience, and had them take a look at the rocker shaft/arms and they could not see anything wrong either. Got a used push rod from them and installed it and the rocker shaft back in the bus, then manually turned the engine over with the valve covers off to observe the valves on #4 and both move and all valves on the drivers side line up. In other word nothing looks out of place. Also installed three new adjuster screws and nuts. Would of done more but I bought the FLAPS out. Any more suggestions, I don't think it was high revving and the bus has seen minimul use since I bought it and I'm pretty sure that #4 was firing when I first bought the bus and drove it home just based on the noticeable power decrease. Also no crazy noises were coming from the bus either. Thanks for the help
