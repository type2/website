Subject: Dizzy overhaul?

I have a 65 Standard currently fitted with a 74 beetle 1600DP engine, fitted
with a PICT 34 carb.   The 009 dizzy installed was oil contaminated, and had a
slight hesitation (apparently common with the PICT 34?).  I temporarily fitted
a distributor from a 1700 type 4 motor, which had a bit of improvement, but it
was recommended by some local vee-dubbers that a proper beetle distributor
would be best.  I picked up a dizzy at the local auto wrecker for a later
model carburetted engine, which has the two vacuum lines (vacuum advance and
retard?)  Anyhow, to make a long story short, the "new" dizzy worked for a
short time but then I had serious idle problems.  I looked for vacuum leaks,
rechecked the timing, adjusted the valves, and even pulled the dizzy to double
check the points and swap out the condenser, that's when I discovered that the
vacuum advance/retard isn't working..it appears that the diaphragm in the
cylinder is shot.  Is the vacuum chamber purchasable by itself as a
replacement item?  The dizzy has a nice stable dwell.  If not (I have the
vacuum ports plugged right now) I may try the 1700 type 4 dizzy again,
although I realize that it doesn't have the correct vacuum curve for the
engine (I believe this dizzy is vacuum retard only?).  Would I set the 1700
dizzy at the 1600DP 5 degrees ATDC, or 10 degrees ATDC for the 1700?  The bus
still has the RGB's!
