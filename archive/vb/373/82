If it's not there it can't short out...

One way to do it:

- Stock hazard flasher switch (four terminals, no light in knob)
- Two 12 V automotive relays
- Generic 12 V flasher (a #559 is closest to the original, but lots of
   numbers will work)

Basically you hook it up according to the stock '63 diagram, but use
the two relays to replace the one original relay (J1 on the diagram.)
The hookup for the two relays is in
