Check the type2 archives. Richard Atwell has listed some vacuum can
sources in some of his posts. Based on your link to the type 4 dizzy,
it looks like it is an advance/retard type dizzy. Does it only have
one nipple? If so, it would be for advance. Retard is only found on
advance/retard dizzies that I have seen. Leave the vaccum hoses off
and time to 7 BTDC initial timing.

 I have a 65 Standard currently fitted with a 74 beetle 1600DP engine, fitted
 with a PICT 34 carb.   The 009 dizzy installed was oil contaminated, and had
a
 slight hesitation (apparently common with the PICT 34?).  I temporarily
fitted
 a distributor from a 1700 type 4 motor, which had a bit of improvement, but
it
 was recommended by some local vee-dubbers that a proper beetle distributor
 would be best.  I picked up a dizzy at the local auto wrecker for a later
 model carburetted engine, which has the two vacuum lines (vacuum advance and
 retard?)  Anyhow, to make a long story short, the "new" dizzy worked for a
 short time but then I had serious idle problems.  I looked for vacuum leaks,
 rechecked the timing, adjusted the valves, and even pulled the dizzy to
double
 check the points and swap out the condenser, that's when I discovered that
the
 vacuum advance/retard isn't working..it appears that the diaphragm in the
 cylinder is shot.  Is the vacuum chamber purchasable by itself as a
 replacement item?  The dizzy has a nice stable dwell.  If not (I have the
 vacuum ports plugged right now) I may try the 1700 type 4 dizzy again,
 although I realize that it doesn't have the correct vacuum curve for the
 engine (I believe this dizzy is vacuum retard only?).  Would I set the 1700
 dizzy at the 1600DP 5 degrees ATDC, or 10 degrees ATDC for the 1700?  The
bus
 still has the RGB's!
