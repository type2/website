Subject: target tv commercial: standard or deluxe?

Hey,

Anyone see the new Target tv commercial where the vw bus gets filled  
up with gifts? Pretty darn neat - even has a demonstration of super  
slow wipers trying to keep the snow off the windshield. ;-)

Did they use two busses in that ad? Or is that a standard with a  
sunroof? Looks cool either way.

Conrad
