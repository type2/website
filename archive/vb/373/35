Subject: Wire Crimpers?

Does anybody know where to get the original style wire crimpers for a reasonable price? Wolfgang Int. sells them for $129 but that is quite spendy.

Secondly, I need an electric choke element for a PICT 28, any vendors out there who sells them new? I tried the local guys and scoured the net but came up with nothing.

Oh yeah, I got the workshop manual from 1/2.com for $59, sweet deal.
