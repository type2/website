Subject: Re: [VB] 6V wipers  running on 12V

Man, every time I've tried to use unregulated 6v wipers on 12 volts, I've beaten my wiper arms to death.  After about 5 minutes, they completely come loose from the shaft.

  6volt wipers do seem to run OK on 12 volts 
for the short times I have had to  use them, up to an
hour
