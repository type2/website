Eric,

Here is the WebCam site: http://www.webcamshafts.com/volkswagen-auto.html

If you stay at or smaller than a 78mm stroke, you can use stock rods. A 
78mm stroke engine and smaller are easier to do than the bigger strokes. 
The three things that need to be done are: 1) clearancing the case 2) 
clearancing the pistons (maybe), 3) setting the compression ratio.

If I were you, I would buy the book: "How to Hot Rod Volkswagen Engines"

It goes into a lot more depth than I can give you here.
