Subject: Re: [VB] Dizzy overhaul?

From dogsbody:

I have a 65 Standard currently fitted with a 74 beetle 1600DP engine, fitted with a PICT 34 carb.   The 009
dizzy installed was oil contaminated, and had a slight hesitation (apparently common with the PICT 34?).  I
temporarily fitted a distributor from a 1700 type 4 motor, which had a bit of improvement, but it was
recommended by some local vee-dubbers that a proper beetle distributor would be best.  I picked up a dizzy at
the local auto wrecker for a later model carburetted engine, which has the two vacuum lines (vacuum advance
and retard?)  Anyhow, to make a long story short, the "new" dizzy worked for a short time but then I had
serious idle problems.  I looked for vacuum leaks, rechecked the timing, adjusted the valves, and even pulled
the dizzy to double
check the points and swap out the condenser, that's when I discovered that the vacuum advance/retard isn't
working..it appears that the diaphragm in the cylinder is shot.  Is the vacuum chamber purchasable by itself
as a replacement item?  The dizzy has a nice stable dwell.  If not (I have the vacuum ports plugged right now)
I may try the 1700 type 4 dizzy again, although I realize that it doesn't have the correct vacuum curve for
the engine (I believe this dizzy is vacuum retard only?).  Would I set the 1700 dizzy at the 1600DP 5 degrees
ATDC, or 10 degrees ATDC for the 1700?  The bus still has the RGB's!

The 021N dizzy will work fine if you do not connect manifold vacuum to the retard side. The retard side is the
inboard port. Leave it open.
Set timing at idle at 7.5 before.

You only would set it at 10 after IF you have vacuum connected to the retard side. Looking at the specs:
Vacuum: 7-12deg Adv, 16-18deg Ret
you see 16-18 degrees retard. If you disconnect vacuum at idle, you would see the timing go from 10 after to
6-8 before.

If you look at the specs of a late beetle,
Beetle 1974 * 1600 Federal Auto-Stick Trans

Distributor: VW 043-905-205A, Bosch 0231 170 036
Vacuum Can: 07 059
Timing Set At:: 7.5deg BTDC (-at-) 800-950rpm w/ strobe and w/single vacuum hose disconnected and plugged
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8-12deg Adv; Centrifugal: 13-15deg (-at-) 2300rpm, 22-25deg (-at-) 3800rpm

and compare them to your 021N minus the retard section:

Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 7-12deg ; Centrifugal: 9-14deg (-at-) 2000rpm, 21-25deg (-at-) 3400 rpm

It is almost the same!
