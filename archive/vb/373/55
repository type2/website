Unfortunately the ratchet type crimpers often are.  The theory seems to
be that they will be sold to someone who is doing manufacturing, so the
tool price gets amortized out over thousands of connections.  But you
can do a little better.  Del City ( http://www.delcity.net ) sells a few
different styles of ratchet crimpers: 990160, $35, for insulated
terminals, and 990165, $28, for non-insulated terminals.  I haven't
tried these crimpers, so I don't know how good they are.  Mouser
( http://www.mouser.com ) sells some more upscale crimpers from AMP and
Sargent, but they are pretty close to Wolfgang's price.

and http://www.bughaus.com/type247.htm among many others.

Standard disclaimers apply; I don't get money from any of the companies
mentioned above.
