See page M-4 8 of the '62-'67 Bus Bentley, 5-19 of the '68-'79 Bus
Bentley, or page 1-12 of the '70-'79 Bug/Ghia Bentley.

Not that much.  The split Bentley doesn't say, but the bay and Bug
Bentleys give a value.  It's also on pages 42-43 of the '69 "Without
Guesswork" at http://www.failsure.net/oacdp .
