Subject: Re: [VB] Headlights?

Hi Seth,

On my '66, the tab on the trim ring lines up with the cutout for the
small parking light in the headlight bucket, which makes the large
hook adjuster medial and above the mounting tab.  The inner ring
should have three rubber tabs that will only fit one way.  Earlier
buses might be different, I don't know.  The obsolete aircooled doc
project has a parts diagram that might be helpful:
