Hi Sam,
Speedo gearing change in early 1964 with introduction of  14" wheels.
Install an oil temp and pressure gauge and you will get to see  what really 
is going on back there.  You never want to go over 230F and we  prefer to keep 
below 220F.  Plus we start to backing off the RPMs when  getting over 210F.
For us 3,000 is cruising RPM.  Our MPG went  from 19 to 27 with stock 1960-63 
tranny and engine lifespan went from about  30,000 - 40,000 to over 80,000.  
Now getting 23 MPG (-at-) 3,000 RPM with 1641  SP (now over 60,000 miles on this 
engine, and the last big bore 40 HP engine  that was ran in our panel is still 
running strong in our SC with way over 80,000  miles on that engine) and 3.875 
R&P freeway flier tranny doing 58  MPH.
