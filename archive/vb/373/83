Subject: 38 AMP generator without a doghouse fan housing ?

Is there a way to run the 71 bus 38 amp generator without using a doghouse  
fan housing ?
 
we were playing around with it yesterday but could not get it to line up ,  
and the fan to fit, 
 
what parts do we need to combine ?
 
thanks for your help + Ho Ho Ho
