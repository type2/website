>>  Sorry bout that, my bus is a 63 Panel (Type 21 1071349).  The Headlight 
rings I have have the adjusting screws at 5 and 11 o clock on  the drivers side 
with the mounting tab at 9 o clock, this headlight ring has  one rivet 
holding the mounting tab to the ring. The passenger side has the  adjusting screws 
at 5 and 11 o clock with the mounting tab at 3 o clock and 2  rivets holding 
the mounting tab on the ring. I'm having trouble with the 11 o  clock (passenger 
side) and 5 o clock (drivers side) interfering with the body  of headlight 
bucket. They are very tough to get on. The PO had removed the  aforementioned 
troublesome adjuster screws. I honestly don't think these  headlight rings go to 
this vehicle. Any assistance is appreciated.

Hi Seth,  
OK,  then you have the 03DEC-67 (from chassi no. 1 211  643) headlight 
assemblies with the mounting tab viewed at 6 O'clock  (as when mounted in the bug) 
the adjusting screws at 2 & 7  O'clock.  These assemblies should work fine on 
your bus even though  they are correct for a slightly later bus.  Thinking that 
someone took  apart your assemblies and possibly put them back together  
incorrectly.  If you want to, Pmail us some images of the top and  bottom sides of 
the assemblies.  Just try to not make the images TOO big  for we are on dial 
up.
