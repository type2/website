Subject: 6V wipers  running on 12V

 6volt wipers do seem to run OK on 12 volts 
for the short times I have had to  use them, up to an
hour
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I ran 6volt wipers in my 12volt 1965 Double Cab for
several years with no problems at all except for the
faster then normal speed which was not really a
problem at all. I had a voltage drop thing to install
but never even put it in the Bus.
