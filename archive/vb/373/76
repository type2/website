Subject: Re: Dizzy overhaul?

Thanks for the replies John and Karl.
I don't want to split hairs, just have the correct distributor for my
application (1600 DP, 34 PICT carb, mountainous driving, RGBs still
fitted)...preferably with out a hesitation when I apply throttle.  I've
learned from my other bus (77 type 2) not to take things for granted!

I want the vacuum retard feature if possible as I will be driving this bus in
the British Columbia mountains, I want at least a vacuum advance as there is a
hesitation in the engine without vacuum advance (34 PICT carb).  The 1700
dizzy (it's a 205E) is pretty darn close to the 74 Beetle dizzy.  Should if I
go back to the 205E, should I set the timing to the 5 degrees ATDC of the 1700
type IV from which it came, to 7.5 degree BTDC of a '74 Beetle?  Another
thought is that I should perhaps use the 71 bus dizzy which has a
significantly more conservative timing and advance/retard curves (This engine
is IRS while my bus still has the RGB's).

If I keep the 74 Beetl;e dizzy, I'll need to source a replacement
vacuum/retard can for it...the dizzy holds dwell perfectly but the can's
diaphragm blew :(


So many questions...thanks for the assistance and patience!
