On my '64, the flasher lives right next to the fuse box where you can
see it, but you have to take down the lining in front of the passenger -
around the right headlight bucket - to see the relay.  If you haven't
checked over there, you might find the disconnected relay lurking over
there someplace.

You might start at http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/050641.html
and possibly http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/068794.html and
even http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/067244.html and if you're
not confused enough by that, come back and ask again.  :)
