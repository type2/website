Subject: Re: [VB] 38 AMP generator without a doghouse fan housing ?

From Oldscholvw

 Is there a way to run the 71 bus 38 amp generator without using a doghouse fan housing ?
We were playing around with it yesterday but could not get it to line up ,  
 and the fan to fit,  what parts do we need to combine ?

All you need is the special dished tin piece and the hub.
It does not matter what shroud you use.
And you also need the 38 amp regulator.

I have all the generator pieces you need.
