Subject: Re: [VB] stroker motor?

I am in the process of building a 88mm (machine-in) X 78.4 stroke 
engine. I am using the 218 WebCam. The engine will have ported, dual 
port heads, and a single dual throat carb (Zenith). I would run duals, 
but I love my  gas heater too much. After talking to several hypo engine 
builders, they generally agree that the engine will be high in torque 
and durable. The 88's have the thickest cylinder wall that I could find. 
Note: The two things that improve torque: stroker crank and special cam. 
Some cams are better at generating torque, some are better at horsepower.
