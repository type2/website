Well, I have a 15 gallon tank (with its sender) from a 71 in my 64. I use my 
original 6V  gage and it seems to be accurate enough.

JD asked:
  I was wondering if anyone knew if using an original 6volt fuel gauge on a
12Volt system should work accurately?  Thats what Im running right now,
and cant get the sender and gauge to calibrate perfectly. (full reads > and
empty is actually just before it hits R)   My sender is original as well
