Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Flasher?

 I believe emergency flashers started for the 63 model year.  They were optional in Euro spec buses, standard on US spec ones.  the wiring diagram for them is the the 63-67 Bentley, but look in the accessories section of the electrical chapter for the 63-65 e-flasher wiring, it is not in the regular wiring diagram.
