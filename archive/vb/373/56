How long is it?  If it's still wearing the generator, take it off or
wrap it up as best you can in plastic.  Soaking the brushes won't make
them very happy.  The distributor will probably be OK as long as the cap
is reasonably secure.  Also want to make sure the valve covers are on
reasonably well.

Hard rubber corks for the intake/exhaust are better than cork ones.  It
may take a little looking to find ones that are big enough; if you've
pushed it in until there's less than 1/4" of cork sticking out, consider
going to the next bigger size before you have to fish a cork out of a
place you don't want it.

I would be careful around any seals that are still on the engine -
pushrod tubes, oil cooler, etc.  Also, if you point the pressure washer
between the crank pulley and the case, you might force water into the
case through the oil return thread - no seal at that end.

After you hose it down, you might want to take out the spark plugs and
turn the engine a couple of times to get rid of any water in the
cylinders, and maybe spritz some oil or WD-40 down in the cylinders.
If you haven't already drained the oil, do that after you hose it off.
Fill up with fresh oil, and if you can, take a longish drive the first
time out to boil out any remaining water - keep an eye on the oil level.

If the area behind the flywheel is messy, the pressure washer may get
some of it off, but I'd finish up with some brake clean and scrubbing.
You really don't want oil from there getting onto the clutch.
