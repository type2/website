Subject: Re: [VB] What to do

 good idea.  If a valve is stuck, then it will bend a push rod which can 
actually break a hole in the push rod tube, and nasty noises as well as lack of 
power.  If a valve is stuck, you need (as least) rebuildt heads.  If you have 
the push rods in, and a friend turns the engine round, you will be able to watch 
the valves open and close... kind of neat

Do a little trouble shooting first. The push rod fell out for a reason. I would 
make sure that the valves move. Try pushing real hard on the end of each of the 
valves in question to be sure that they have not frozen in place. Then install 
the new push rods.
