First, check the fuses.  On your Bus, the low beams aren't fused, but
the high beams are - one fuse for the left and one for the right.  If
they are OK, then with the lights OFF, disconnect all three wires at the
floor stomp dimmer switch.  Without letting any of the three bare ends
touch anything else, turn on the lights and touch the white/black stripe
and yellow wires together - this should turn on the low beams.  Then
take the yellow wire away and touch the white/black stripe and white
wires together - this should turn on the high beams.  Turn off the
lights.  If this works OK, your dimmer switch is probably bad, but if it
doesn't work, then the wiring between the switch and the bulbs is bad,
or you might have burned-out filaments in the bulbs.

Another possibility is that the PO installed low-beam-only sealed beams;
stranger things have happened.  Take one out and if you only see two
prongs on the back of the bulb, this is what has happened.  Get some
6006 bulbs for 6 V or 6012 (among others) for 12 V.  See
