Subject: Re: [VB] Gauge mounting on my 64

Hi Chris,
Just build one for the ash tray spot on the dash.  Made one for three gauges
(volt, oil pressure and temp) in triangle shape and love it.  Both driver and
passenger can easily see the gauges which means more likely to catch engine
problem before a rebuild is required.
  Have had fellow VW owners in the passenger seat and they find it very
interesting to see oil pressure changes as the relief valves open and close!
E&B
