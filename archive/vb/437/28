"Any data that was mistakenly taken from the type2.com AIRS site has been
removed."
That's good, no sense having out dated information on a new and vibrant
website.  Maybe you could take his updated info and add it to your site.  I
doubt if Chris would mind.

" have asked for volunteers to continue to support and update AIRS with little
success."
I have been on this list for a very long time and I never recall asking for
help with updating the airslist.  The only posts I recall is asking for money.

 "I just wish we could have a single central interface."
Swallow your pride and direct people to www.aircooledrescue.com.
