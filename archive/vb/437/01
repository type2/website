Hey Bob,

It is a standard. It may be a bit brave, but I've done crazier before. At
least I get one short trip to sort of test it out - LA to San Jose. 

When I go cross country, I'll be sure to bring an AIRS list, and my AAA!

whoa, brave to grab an unknown bus then try to cross the country.
make sure you have your AIRS list.
is this an auto tranny ?? (getting e-mails crossed) if so carry a spare
starter, you can't push start an automatic and as I once had to do when
trying something similar, I ended up at U-Haul with a truck and trailer to
get her home the last couple hundred miles.  keep your credit card handy and
your AAA membership

good luck and have fun

Bob
