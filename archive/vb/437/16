John speaks in sign language i think,,, he said:

I found an early air cooled engine today  it is it there are no heater 
boxes or distributor  other than that its all there 28 PCI number on 
generator stand is 2075805 - does this number date it? it has a spark plug 
wire tube - I guess - I've never seen one before. Any market for parts off 
of something like this? It bottomed out and there is a hole in the bottom of 
the block  other than that it was painted black, stored inside, turns over, 
and is rust free. ..

--------
so,, I ask,,, is there a space after the 20?  is the fuel pump and 
distributor "reversed" from a 1600cc?  does the oil filler have an external 
screw to hold the black filler on,,  is the oil pan still there, and is it 
much smaller than a 1600cc? ,, does the intake manifold meet the head at 90 
deg,,
might be a pre jan 56 engine 25hp
