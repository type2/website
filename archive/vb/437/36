Subject: the keys this time of year?

hey guys - only bus content is that it's staying home for this trip (but 
will be going to charlotte next week!)

anyway - anyone have any suggestions for places to stay (indoor!) 
short-notice in down in the (florida..) keys?  friday/sat night?

gonna be in miami for my sisters graduation thursday, and why waste the 
trip that far south, right?
