Hi John,
You really need to check that play more often then.  Once that too loose you
are damaging both the clutch and syncros in the transaxle!!!  Ruin those parts
or wear them out and you have a lot more work and $$$ to put things back to
right.  Plus when you check more often and find the adjustment at the higher
side (but not way way too loose), it is an easy small amount of tightening
that will take a lot less time.

Brakes are similar!!  Keep them adjusted and one has more brake pad surface in
contact with the drum and shoes will last about twice as long.  Thusly the
more contact between those parts means more braking power.  Once you adjust
the brakes check the E/parking brake for how many clicks it takes to lock the
shoes against the drums.  Should be five clicks, adjust the brake cables for
that amount.  Then later when you note you are getting six or barely seven
clicks, it is time to readjust the brake shoes.
