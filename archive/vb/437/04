Subject: Tigerbus heading to a new home....end of an era.

I've been very quiet on this list for many years, but still around and
reading.  After 10 years and 4 days Tigerbus has been sold.  We took one
last trip last night for desert, but it's time to send it to a new home.
 Fortunately I'm not out of the bus scene all together, and need to finish
the '62 15 window I have, but it's not currently on the road.  If you see
it heading west in the next few days from Austin to California, wave.  It's
the new owner
