Subject: RE: [T2] New Airslist - www.aircooledrescue.com

Ok, so here's the offical answer.  Not the one I wanted to give, alas, 
it's the answer that is.

www.aircooledrescue.com has no relationship or affiliation with type2.com. 
Any data that was mistakenly taken from the type2.com AIRS site has been 
removed.

The owner of the new site has chosen to support and run this himself.


The existing type2.com AIRS project remains as-is, with limited volunteer 
support.

We, the folks who keep the lights on for type2.com (since July 1996, for 
those keeping count) and AIRS, have asked for volunteers to continue to 
supoprt and update AIRS with little success.  I commend Chris for stepping 
up and building his own system to suite his own needs, I just wish we 
could have a single central interface.


Do note that we (type2.com) have no insight into the use of the data you 
provide to aircooledrescue.com, and cannot vouch for the owner of the 
system - to my knowlege he's never been a subscriber of t2 or vb.
