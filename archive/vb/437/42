I used a similar looking but more expensive one made by Dometic many 
years ago. It was very good.

I don't like the noise of compressors, these are quiet.

They use a lot of power on 12V (I only use that when driving) and are 
not terribly efficient on 120V either since those are both just 
running heaters to make it work, but that rarely matters.
They use about a gallon of propane per month, and that is how they run best.
Mine was not super powerful, you want to keep it shaded and it may 
not handle 100+ degree temps as well as a compressor fridge, but that 
could be different for this one.
They do need to be kept level when parked or may not work and 
possibly burn out. Due to being short on height the design can't run 
with as much angle as a Vanagon fridge.
