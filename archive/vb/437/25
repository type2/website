David - someone did a study on different penetrating oils for dealing with
rusted nuts. They found the best thing to use, and also probably the
cheapest, is a mixture of Acetone and Automatic Transmission Fluid. 

 

See here - http://www.zl2al.com/blog/2857/rusty-nuts/

 

Since then I've tried to find the actual article/test. All I've come up with
so far-the test was not very scientific, and used pressed fitting as opposed
to nuts and bolts. The article is in the April 2007 issue of The Machinist
Workshop. I've ordered a copy of the issue, and will let you all know what
is in there for info.
