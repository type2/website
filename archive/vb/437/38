Stayed here a summer or two ago, cool little Mom & Pop on Key Largo:
Bay Cove Motel
99446 Overseas Hwy. (MM 99.5) Bayside (right-hand side)
Key Largo, FL 33037
(305) 451-1686

You can snorkel in the bay behind the place, or there is a great daytripper
snorkeling tour just up the road: http://reef-roamer.com/. I wouldn't
recommend trying to get much further south in that short a visit unless you
just want the road trip, but every mile brings more delights down there.

Tip: south of Homestead look for the Card Sound Bridge turnoff to the left,
an alternate route to the Keys that takes you by the very funky Alabama
Jack's.

Bus content: If you had more time you could rent one of these :-) -
