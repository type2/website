Subject: Vanagon(-at-)Lenti results

And the total is:

At least 66 current listmembers from V(-at-)L are still hanging out on one of 
the three lists and could be bothered to waste the electrons to reply.

Breakdown is:

Vintagebus  9
Type2      14
Vanagon    43 (counting me only once... I'm still on all three lists.)

The door prize is graciously supplied by early listmember 'Poor' Richard 
Palmer (currently answering from T2).  His message follows:

Trivia for those ole timers only on one list:

FWIW, Al Knoll replied and let me know that Martha says 'Hi!', Bradley's 
nowhere to be found and Schwarze (who replied from T2) has a new career 
as a Husband.

Hooper and Dolan are hanging out on the T2 list. Unca Joel is here, 
there and everywhere.

Thom Fitzpatrick is admin of the VB list. Tom Carrington is running 
Vanagon and I don't know who the hell the admins of T2 are this week. ;o)
