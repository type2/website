Dart,

Don't know who are but you're not telling the whole story.  You hit a
nerve with me. My buddy and I have been doing vw's for quite a while.  I
have put on the parade for 10 years now.  We have a blast. We are
developing quite a little vw secret pocket out here. Don't know where
you tried to get parts, etc, but we have spent a lot of time developing
friends and contacts.  If you think there are no vw's out here,
fine....just makes it easier on us. Western KS might not be everyone's
idea of paradise, but we like it and it's a great place for families,
vw's and kids..... So, if you don't want to come to our little parade
and have a good time, that's your choice!
