Time for summer travels to begin in the 58 single cab with a Brazilian
tilt for protection.  This is not going to be the months long trip as we
had planned but a series of shorter trips with returns the Ventura to
get some work done.  Maybe.

Next weekend we are headed to Scofield, Utah.  No bus meet (although
with a parade for Pleasant Valley Days in Scofield you never know, it
only takes 3 right) but a family reunion for Cath's family.  We will be
heading to Las Vegas first, camping out the first night.  The heading up
15 into Utah we will start skirting the edges of 15 going north.
Scofield is east of 15 and north of 70, 150 miles south east of Salt
Lake City, towards Price.  No definite plans but willing to wander if
anyone has interesting sites or looking for a chance to chat.

Looking at heading up to Morgan Utah, north of SLC then up to Boise for
the Bus Pilot meet.  Unfortunately we may have to head home then, but
then there is always the Rocky Mountain Motor Works meet in Colorado and
Hot August nights in Reno the same weekend.  So many temptations, so
many choices ... so little time.

We will still have email access on this trip so you can reach us here.

Looking forward to being somewhere near that brazilian rain forest Scott
was talking about .... well maybe not this trip.  Maybe we need that
tracking device so you can follow our erratic path.
