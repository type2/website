I'm sorry.   When I replied, I hit reply instead of Reply All.

Yep - No code license will get you on board.  Just some rules/regs & 
technical info.  Well within the grasp of our listees.

I've been picking them up on ebay and averaging $75 with shipping and 
another $25 for the antenna

Again I found a guy on ebay that has OEM units (no display or keypad) and 
picked up three for $55/ea  plus active antenna for $15

>and about $150 worth of interface hardware.

There is a unit called TinyTrak  ( http://www.byonics.com ) $33 with 
shipping, that is the radio modem.  It takes the ascii output from the GPS 
receiver and converts it to FSK and then keys the radio.  In addition to 
this you will need a metal case to house it all in, some wire and 
connectors.  The last one I built the case was $14 and misc 
stuff/connectors came to $35.

Tonight I'm building up another one and am going for small.  I had some 
junk hard drives hanging around and started thinking, hmmm....  That looks 
like it would work as a metal case.  I laid everything out in the gutted 
out case and so far so good.

So... I'm building systems for around $225/ea and that's the end of the 
expenditures.  No monthly service agreements, no monthly bills, and a very 
accurate system for finding your bus.

Amateur Radio has many advantages to bus people.  With all the traveling 
that most of us do, it provides a great link well beyond that of the FRS 
radio systems that everyone is jumping on these days.  How many times have 
you been on a trip and found yourself in an area of NO cell phone 
coverage?    There are amateur radio systems that provide coverage just 
about anywhere you'd like to go.
check out the condor system that is in CA, NV, AZ.  Instant coverage just 
about anywhere in that area.

If anyone is interested in getting their ham license and doesn't know where 
to start, get ahold of George or myself.  If we get enough people, we could 
even startup the VBARC or OBARC  (vintage or old  Bus Amateur Radio Club)

BTW, that's what the KN6F is all about, its my FCC call sign.
