Subject: Buckeye German Jubilee

    It is that time of year again! Time for the Buckeye German Jubilee the
show is going to be held July 6&7 at Jims Custom VWs in Columbiana, Ohio
This year there will be dash plaques a free trophy Car show and plenty of
door prizes. There are games for kids and those young at heart and free
primitive camping over night. This show is a laid back event so if you are
looking to go to an uptight concourse VW show don't bother coming, however
if you are looking for a fun time for you and your family this is the show
for you.Columbiana is about 15 minutes south of Youngstown Ohio on the
eastern side of the state. Hope to see you there! If you need more
information e-mail me at volksnut(-at-)1st.net

See you soon,
John W. Morris
Tri-State VW Club

P.S. This show was featured in vw trends last year (not that that makes it
any better!;)
God bless
