Subject: fresh air vent cover goo

Hi All,

Progress on the double cab has been going at a break-neck pace... I lowered
it down on the jack stands the other night and commenced to work on the
interior a bit more since I received two nos cable grommets for the fuel tap
and choke cables.  Both cables are in now and ready to go.  I've started the
wiring of the dash and I'm using og wire when possible so I have the correct
*brass* wire ends instead of the oh-so-incorrect cad plated ends I found
(but at least they are metric).  Thanks to Richard Barker for pieces of his
og wire harness.   At the classic, I was able to finally find some correct
wire sheathing from the WireWerks guy to run the overhead dome light wire (I
never could find an og wire) and I also ran a wire up for the ambo fans.

So, with all that said, what is really halted me is the mounting of the
ambulance fans.  On every fresh air cover I have ever removed, there are
three pieces of the rubber stripping on the sides and upper edge but the
lower edge has some form of goo that is used to seal things up.  Anyone have
an idea of a good representative of this stuff....  I'll stop here before I
go on to ask people if they have saved this stuff in hopes to get it and
somehow re-use it lest you all slap me silly next time we meet.  :-O



David
