Subject: '59 SC...blasting the bed and other resto stuff

Did (4) more hours of blasting the bed of my '59 Single Cab truck. 
I've got a big electric compressor...but sure wish I had one of those 
Volks-Air setups or something. I still have to wait for my compressor 
to keep up. Slows me down pretty good. But I am able to do the 
job...just not as fast as I'd like....so what's new!!!!

There's a good amount of rust settled into the bed. It's one of the 
only areas the previous owner didn't blast. The rust has eaten into 
the metal and pitted it pretty good. You can tell it sat outside for 
years and years and years. No "rust thru" anywhere though other than 
a pinhole here or there. In fact, the bed is solid as a rock. Just 
ugly from pits and dents. I've got less than 1/4 of the bed left to 
blast. Then I'll have to decide if I'm gonna blast the treasure chest 
area. It's the other area the PO didn't blast. Looks like a pain in 
the ass to me.

I'm gonna go around the outside with the blaster after all this. I 
had used phosphoric acid but then stupidly washed it off with soap 
and water. Got a tad bit of flash on there and might as well take 
care of it. I would use the phosphoric acid again...but I put primer 
on there already....DOH!!!  Luckily it's real thin and blasts off in 
a blink of the eye.

One of these days I'll finally have the rust at bay on this truck. 
Once I'm there...it'll be time to start on the undercarraige and the 
running gear. POR-15 will cover the undercarraige. For the running 
gear I've got a '66 front beam I think I'm gonna install and then a 
Rancho freeway flyer tranny in the back with big nut reduction gear 
boxes.

Got some parts for the budget Upright T4 conversion. An aftermarket 
36hp fan shroud with the Doghouse cooler on it...plus all the tin 
that goes with it. An altenator was on there...wonder if it works! 
Also got a set of 96MM pistons and cylinders that will work with the 
stock 1700cc crank and rods. That'll put me up to 1911cc or something 
with more or less stockish parts. Also scored a set of Weber ICT dual 
carbs with T4 manifolds. Havn't spent too much money on this stuff. 
Still have to get a cam/lifter set and get the heads rebuilt. Then a 
gasket set and I'm ready to start putting it together.

Pictures are all on my site if you want to see the before and after 
closeup of the bed blasting. Just click on the '59 Single Cab 
link....it's the second page after that. It's UGLY!
