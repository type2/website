AridZona it truly is!! This is one of the most unique areas in the World.  A
Living Desert with less then 8" of rain a year--In the North where the fire
is--there has been almost no snow fall--In the last 25 years or so, Man has
come here in droves, and actually, by paving the Desert, with
roads--freeways--houses--shopping centers, has changed the climate to even
hotter days and nights, this has occurred since we moved here in
1979! --Proving time and time again, that Growth is the biggest deterrent to
Progress.
