Subject: Vancouver Great Canadian Show

Hey there list!

I'm just wondering if anyone here might be participating in the Gene Berg
cruise to the Great Canadian VW Show happening in Vancouver on August 18th?
We're organizing a big Alberta cruise out to the show so maybe I'll be able
to meet a few of you for the first time!
