Scott, I'm still a bit confused, what parts are in the bus and what parts do
you need at home to track it with?  I also noticed on your last email when
you were tracking your daughters car, you had it on a map, how were you able
to do that?

This really does sound like a great addition to a vehicle, and with
teenagers driving, this would be a great way to keep track of your kids (I'm
sure they would hate it, but what are parents for?).

Thanks Scott for all your information.
