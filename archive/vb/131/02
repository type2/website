Subject: Dodge City, KS

I lived in Dodge City, KS for 3 years and never heard anything about a VW 
parade. I know of one splitty in town, maybe 3 baywindows, a handful of 
bugs, and after I left no Vanagons. When I got my motor rebuilt on my 74 I 
had to drive 2 towns west into another time zone to find the closest VW 
mechanic, and if you need parts there, forget it. I was just back last month 
to see some friends, and I doubt I will ever make that drive again. Driving 
though western Kansas is definitly my least favorite drive. It is a good 6 
hours from KC and 5 hours from OKC, so not worth the drive if you are not 
going to stay for a few days and do the tourist thing. But if you do go be 
sure and check out the wax museum and hit up the show at boothill, I know 
Miss Kitty and she's quite a gal :)

I've heard there is a kick butt little VW parade in Dodge City, Kansas, on 
the 4th of July.  Anybody have info on this event?  I'll be in that area and 
would like to bring my little Westy over for the morning.
Thanks.
