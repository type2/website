Subject: 67 tranny troubleshoot/rebuilds near CO?

hi listees,
I've been having some troubles with my '67 camper's tranny, and am looking for a
bit of advice.  The tranny is original swing-axle type and is powered by a shiny
new 1600 dp from VW brazil/mexico (which is purring sweetly!).  Anyhow, the
tranny has been a bit rough from the getgo, but as I was pulling some mild hills
about a month ago, I blew a seal, lost all my tranny oil, and came to a grindy,
jerky halt on the side of a curvy mountain road.  After coaxing her to a pull-off
500 ft away (whew!), I had her towed back to take a good look.  Upon cleaning and
filling her back up with oil, I was relieved to find that she ran fine, except
for the leak and a rough whining/grinding upon engaging the clutch.  I pulled the
engine, replaced the rear tranny seal annd both boots, but she still has a
constant leak from just under the right swing axle joint, looks like its sneaking
out between the plate there as the boot is new and tight as a drum.   Any ideas??

Also, since I'm preparing to take her all around the country, I will need a
rebuilt tranny at some point (she's always popped out of fourth), so now looks
like as good a time as any.  Can anyone get me a rebuilt tranny or know where I
could look?
Thanks much to all for your help, I can't wait to get back on the road!
