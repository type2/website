Subject: amusing carb statement

saturday i rebuilt 5 carburetors (2 were for the 50 ch(-at-)vy 1/2 ton)... for
kicks, mainly. also as spares.

i had the top off a 28pict1, and was running wd40 thru the accel pump
circuit to aim the squirter. wife came up and said: "its so cool when you
play with your little barbie sink."

would that make a weber a barbie jacuzzi?
