Subject: Transportation of a VW from CA to PA

Anyone going or know of someone going from California
to Pensilvana?  I have a 67 VW project car (bug) that
needs to be transported from the Fresno are to the PA
area.  Any leads out there?  Anyone willing to tow one
out on a trip?

I have looked at some of the standard shipping
companies but they are a bit pricy.

Thanks
Matthew
