Subject: Hot VW's free-you pay postage

Hi, All...
   I am in the middle of moving and have a bunch of Hot VW mags
up for grabs...   most from 1992 to 1996(not all months)... come by
and get them (Stillwater,OK) or pay the postage.  Or else they go
to recycle...  (Also have many years of Easyrider and Chopper if
you want those too. Way back to 1974!)
Thanks!
