Subject: Cam Identification

Hello List -
I am trying to identify the camshaft in a 1600
mystery engine I am rebuilding. It is a late
model case with a 4 rivet cam. Numbers on the cam
are 113 109 101F, which indicate a T1 part #.
I've scoured the web, various bus vendors, and
the archives searching for a match (the 101F
number), but with no success. The cam has an 'M'
embossed on it between 2 of the lobes (standing
for Mahle?). Any help or direction appreciated.
Thanks,
Cary
