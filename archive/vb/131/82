Oh, sorry about that.

INSIDE THE BUS.
1. 144 MHz (VHF) transceiver - in this case a 5 watt handheld about 6" x 
2.5" x 1.5"

2. The GPS/Modem box - depends upon how small you can make it.  This case 
is 6" x 4" x 2"

3. The VHF antenna - small glass mount antenna, looks like a cell phone antenna

4. The GPS antenna. - this can be various sizes, in my case its a 4" x 4" x 
1/4" that is hidden under the rear window.

5. A battery - This is not needed if you only power the unit when the car 
is running.  You need a battery if you want to protect against someone 
towing your bus away.  A small motorcycle battery is more than enough to 
power the unit for 24 hours without charging.  A small 7.0 AH gel cell 
battery 6" x 2.5" x 4" according to my calculations should provide about 26 
hours of operation.

6. a few wires and a charging relay for the battery.

The whole thing could be built to fit inside an adult sized lunchbox, 
including the battery.  Put the battery on the bottom half and the radio 
and GPS/Modem on the top half.

INSIDE THE HOUSE
a computer connected to the internet.
a copy of your Amateur Radio License
that's all


I had originally held off on putting one together for Theresa's Bug for the 
very reason that you mention.  Once her car was stolen, she had a whole new 
outlook on it.  She at the young age of 16 (week before her 17th), joined 
the ranks of the pissed off, as mad as hell and not going to take it any 
more.  They stole the car that she worked so hard to buy.

The big clincher, is that all the theft deterrents/preventions in the world 
would not have kept her Bug from being stolen (except chaining it to the 
house).  They were pushing the Bug up the freeway.
