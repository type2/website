Subject: Happy Birthday Bus

The production date of my '67 Deluxe is "23 6" so I'm wishing a happy
birthday to it and all other buses out there.  Production of the split
ended on June 30, 1967, so all our babies will be 35 plus by the end of
the week.  I put about 250 miles on mine last week, just going to work. 
Bless you, Ben Pon.
