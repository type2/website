Subject: Re: [VB] Someone stole my engine?

  Anyone ever had their engine  stolen?

No but in a related story someone used an engine to steal. About 10 or so
years ago, a friend of mine saw an add in the newspaper stating " Newly
rebuilt 1776, will trade for your 1600cc, I want to go back to stock!" So my
friend got excited and called the guy up.

The guy and his wife showed up with the 1776 engine, dropped my friends
engine out in about 20 minutes with the help of his wife, slapped in the
1776 then they left. My friend was very happy with the deal.
3 hours later that same bug was stolen out of his driveway.
Coincedence? probably not. That guy now knew the ins and out of the bug,
wether it had an alarm/ kill switch/ etc and who he was dealing with, a 16
year old kid.
