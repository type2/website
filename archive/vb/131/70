Scott didn't answer, so I will.

The system is called APRS - Amateur radio Position Reporting System.  To
use it, you need an amateur radio license, a 2m radio ($200), a GPS
($100), and about $150 worth of interface hardware.  Scott can probably
tell us better, and I might have overestimated some costs.

It is a neat
system and has been used to locate stolen cars.  The police have a hard
time believing that ordinary folks have this capability, being stuck with
LoJack and TeleTrak systems.  With the improvement in GPS resolution, you
can pinpoint the car to within a few feet.
