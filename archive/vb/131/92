Subject: enginge sound control

i recently posted this to the mcmaster-carr forum(no response yet), i tho=
ught
i posted to the vintage list, but dont remember seeing it. I know a few h=
ave
written up different things about this, but i have not seen any one write=

about this stuff.

i have an older vehicle('65 Vw Bus) I am trying to control the noise comi=
ng
form the engine compartment-it is rather loud, even with the bus tuned up=
, and
all exhaust leaks eliminated. =


The area of the engine is always a little oily and greasy. so i need some=
thing
that is esy to clean. =


I was thinking of using some of the adhesive back damping sheets. I was j=
ust
going to peel and stick these inside the engine compartment. =


The two i was looking at were the 3-ply aluminum(9709T25)which has the hi=
ghest
DLF rating or the viscoelastic asphalt(9709T26). Or possibly both. The
aluminum just intuitively does not seem to be a good sound damper. does a=
nyone
have any experience with this stuff? =


the other options could be the urethane coated foam(5692T51) but i dont
imagine this stuff is to easy to keep clean in an oily environment =


thanks for any suggestions =
