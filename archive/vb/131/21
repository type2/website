The problem with the 68-70 MC is the two nipple holes.
67 only, 71-79, Rabbits, Volvos, MB, and just about all other dual masters are
85mm apart.
The 68-70 is 100mm from center to center. Unless you use the 69/70 upper and
lower reservoir, there is no other reservoir available with a screw cap on it
for 100mm masters. [as far as I know....]
The 68 upper and lower is one-year-only with a metal pipe between the two.
69/70 has a flexible plastic? tube.
