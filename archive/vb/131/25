The problem with the 68-70 MC is the two nipple holes.
67 only, 71-79, Rabbits, Volvos, MB, and just about all other dual masters
are
85mm apart.
The 68-70 is 100mm from center to center.

With my 67 dual circuit SC I used the adapter plate and a 71-79 bus MC. It
has res holes 85mm apart and fits the stock 67 res or 71-79 Rabbit res
perfectly. I have pics posted at Type2.com and SV2.
