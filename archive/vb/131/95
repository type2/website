Subject: Torsion Bar Composition

Hello everyone:

Are there any scientific types out there that know the chemical composition
or material used for the Bus rear torsion bars?

We have a customer that wants to know for some sort of unusual custom
project and none of our books have that information.

Thank You,

Walt and /or Charles
