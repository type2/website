Subject: Dellorto DRLA carbs

I got a pair of twin 40 DRLA dellorto carbs the other day of an Alfa Romeo
in a scrapyard.  I know I can use these on a VW engine, but will they be too
big for a bus?  What sort of size engine should I be looking at minimum to
be able to use them.
I can get smaller venturis for them, would this help the fact that they are
too big?
I was hoping to get the 36 ones, but this pair were the only ones they had!

Thanks
Paul
