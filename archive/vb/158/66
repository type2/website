They work by using a "peltier". This small device has an interesting ability 
to produce cold on one side and heat on the other when current is applied. 
By using a heatsink on both sides, the heatsink gets cold on one side and 
the other gets hot. By using a fan on both sides: distrubuting cold to the 
items in the fridge, and eliminating heat on the other. They are nifty but 
consume alot of power. And most coolers are affeccted by weather. In other 
words, they can drop the temperature in the cooler by X degrees. So if it is 
80 outside and its rated to drop the temp to 30 below ambient, you get 50 
degrees cooling. This is an example most are better at cooling.

Most work best by putting cold foods/drinks in it first and it keeps them 
cool. Starting with something warm will cool down but it takes a lot of 
time.

Still, expect a serious drain on the battery.
