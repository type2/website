Awesome!  Thanks for the help.

I thought it would be more complicated than that :)  There is a good framing
shop nearby that I will check with about it.

... Now I can get rid of the repos I currently have... Which have served
much better than I expected to be quite honest!  (years ago I was told they
would instantly rust out or break or something equally depressing by many
folks)

  
Take Care,

I also got my elephant ears with no glass. I took them to a local     
glass/mirror shop, and for the princely sum of ~$6.00 each they cut me
new ones.
