See, that's the Twilight Zone question. The whole purpose for big bore is
HP. Just how much HP vs. longevity is up to you. Drag racers want as much HP
as they can get, but then, they are only going 1/4 mile with as little
weight as possible with no guarantees that they will return to the pits with
an intact engine.

On the other hand, I want to load my family up and go out on the hiway for
an undetermined amount of miles into hilly and flat country. The last thing
I want to think about is the engine in the back while I am explaining to the
kids that we are not there yet.

In my 71 westy I went through two 1776 motors with about 50K each. I had
plenty of HP for the year and a half that I drove it, but it finally gave
out. The next one was the same. On a loaded bus that seems to be the life
expectancy of a 1776. Go up from there in the same application and your life
expectancy drops even further. I got 35K out of a 1915 in my crew cab, but
of course I used 92mm jugs, my mistake.

My SC has a 1641 and has 28K on the 6 month old engine and is still running
strong. It is my daily driver and I put over 300 miles a week most of the
time on it. I rarely see the bed of my truck because I am hauling stuff all
the time. The truck was designed for this size motor and HP. I feel
comfortable that I will get 60-70K out of it the way I work it each day. A
year and a half is about as long as I can stretch a motor because I don't
give it any breathing room. It's my truck, and by golly, that's what I'm
using it for !

Now, the same motor in a bug should get 80-100K driven correctly each day.
Better power to weight ratio.

Ya, me too. But the question at hand concerns your choice
of low ( and even lower ) CR for engine longevity. So, OK, then-
Just how low can you go ? Should a big bore engine be tuned
to run on kerosene ? ( A 1641 is not a big bore, it's an overbore:).
What is your "optimal " CR,  why does it lower for bore increase ,
and what is the approximate optimal length of life for the chosen CR ?
