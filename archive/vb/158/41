According to Bentley, you first tighten the inner nut against the thrush
washer to 25 ft-lbs, while turning the brake drum.  Then place the
bendable lock washer (you do have one, don't you?) on the spindle and
the outer nut on top of it finger-tight.  By degrees, loosen the inner
nut and pry at the thrush washer with a screwdriver until you can get a
tiny bit of wiggle in it.  How much wiggle depends on how calibrated
your eyeball is, but if the wiggle isn't there the nut is too tight and
the bearings could be damaged in use.  Finally, hold the inner nut still
and tighten the outer nut against it to 50 ft-lbs.  (If you don't have a
torque wrench, you'll have to wing it.)  Recheck the wiggle in the
thrush washer, then bend the lock washer tabs over the nuts to hold them
steady.

When tightening the two nuts against each other, you may have trouble
finding a wrench to hold the inner nut that is thin enough to fit behind
the wrench holding the outer nut.  I was able to do it with a pair of
needle-nose vice grips on the inner nut.  Don't forget that the driver's
side nuts tighten anti-clockwise.

BTW Bentley also specifies about 1/3 cup of bearing grease in the cavity
between the inner and outer bearings.
