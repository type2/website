Subject: re:another burnt bus/fuel lines

was writ:
"I cut 2 one inch pieces of flex line to use as 'grommets on either side of
the
firewall via tip from erid&barb I believe(just keeps it from sliding)."

This is actually not the way I believe they intended. If you put it on as
you suggest-the metal fuel line is still exposed to the metal of the engine
tin. Vibration will wear a hole through the metal fuel line. The way I did
this is to take a piece of fuel line-about 3 or 4 inches long, slice it
length wise. Pull over metal fuel line where metal fuel line goes through
engine tin-clamp or tape in place. This way the flex fuel line acts as a
bumper to protect the metal. This also reduces vibration as it fits tighter
in the engine tin hole.

hope that is clear.
