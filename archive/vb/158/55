Hi Wes,
First remove the bulb and check it.  Next check the wire from the idiot light 
bulb holder to the idiot light sender for continuity.  Lastly check the 
regulator connection for grounding when engine off and not grounding when 
engine is running.

Extractor muffler will make a stock engine run hotter unless the carb jetting 
is changed.  Stock will work fine unless you run a 1776 or bigger engine or 
are into running your engine well over 4,000 RPM.

For us 3,000 RPM is top cruising RPM, especially during warm weather any 
higher and the engine oil temp tends to push too close to the 230F limit.  In 
weather over 80F we have had to slow down a few MPH to keep poil temp below 
220F.  Higher than 230F cooks the oil into a lesser lubricating state and 
engines tend to last less than 40,000 miles instead of 80,000.  Also when we 
went from driving at 3,800RPM (55MPH) to 3,000RPM (47MPH) our 40 HP big bore 
engine went from 19 MPG to 27 MPG.  Now have a 3.875 R&P freeway flier and CW 
1641 SP and getting about 21MPH (-at-) 58 MPH.
