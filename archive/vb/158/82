Kevin,

Good Tip!  I tried that originally but did't think of slicing duh!  Wasn't 
too worried cause the 'grommets' kinda keep it snug!  But I'll be splicing!

Thanks,

Eric

The way I did
>this is to take a piece of fuel line-about 3 or 4 inches long, slice it
>length wise. Pull over metal fuel line where metal fuel line goes through
>engine tin-clamp or tape in place.
