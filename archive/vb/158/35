Al-
Your previous post confused deck height with engine balance.
This one has deck height confused with cylinder head flycut.
Deck height is the distance from the piston ( at the top of it's
stroke ) to the top of the cylinder.Heads do not affect deck height.
Case decking does, however.

Heads are flycut individually, and it's entirely possible to install
one which is flycut and one which isn't , or one cut deeper.
The flycut will have direct effect on chamber volumes.
That is the function of measuring chamber volumes, to determine
that chambers match, as well as providing proper and equal CR.
