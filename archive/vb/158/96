I guess the question comes down to hot day, keep the heat off, use available
air to cool engine. Or, hot day, turn the heat on, bake the driver and the
engine. Temp gauge seems to bear it out.

Dumb question. What is the difference between the air hoses leaking and with
turning on the heat
with correctly fitting hoses?

They were so loose that air
was blowing right past them. As I let the engine run I noticed the oil temp
climbing. I pulled the hoses and put two block offs in the shroud and the
fired up the engine again. After five minutes the oil temp started back down
into a safe area I could live with.
