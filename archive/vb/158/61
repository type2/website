Hi Volks,
BTDT when we bought our red/white large tent for $250.00 from a wrecking yard 
out in Iowa.  It had been stored in a barn and rats had gotten to it.  We 
were able to hand wash out all the stains and hang it to dry.  The 
toilet/changing room has a hole in one wall you could throw a cat through 
easily.  We since then have aquired walls from another same colored tent, but 
has no toilet/changing room at all.  On top of this in this deal to get these 
walls the vynil bottoms were unstiched from the walls to be kept by another 
Westie owner because they matched his tent bottoms.  
  Ssooo this means we have a several ways to repair this.

1.  Take one of the otherwise perfect replacement walls, cut it up and repair 
the hole.
2.  Find someone who has a spare damaged wall we can cut and repair with.
3.  Find someone who has a spare complete toilet/changing room wall section.

We hate to do #1, #2 would work, & #3 would be best in our opinion.  So does 
anyone have any extra tent pieces and would be interested in trading, or 
knows of someone who does/would?
Thanks,  Eric&Barb
