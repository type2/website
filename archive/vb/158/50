FWIW, I'm setting up 7 Tektronix/Xerox network color 
printers here at work over the next few days. The 
dessicant pack is HUGE, a 4 lb., 7x7" pillow 
of "ClayDri, Advanced Desiccant Technology". Says 
reactivation time is 16 hours at 245f, so it's 
reuseable. 
I'll ship 6 of these to the first 6 people in humidity 
challenged areas who e-mail me AND make an additional $5 
donation to the list. Domestic only, please, I'll pay 
shipping.
