Subject: '52 Barndoor Standard project FOR SALE

Just wanted to give everyone a heads up.  I'm looking to sell my '52 Barndoor 
bus (project).  Due to me buying a new house, I now need the money, time, and 
space more than the bus.  (I'm very sad about this)  

Anyway, the bus is still in the same condition it was when I bought it back 
around '95 (needs rockers, doglegs, and other misc. body work), but it now 
also comes with many NOS and great used parts to complete the project.  I 
can't even start to tell you how many thousands of dollars I've spent 
collecting parts for this project.  All of these parts will go with the bus.  
I'm not interested in parting it out.  At this time I'm still trying to put a 
list together of everything I have for it, but here's just a sample:
-NOS complete headlights
-NOS accelerator pedal
-NOS middle brake light
-NOS ignition switch with keys
-6 leg middle seat and front seat
-correct front bumper
-original piano hinge vent windows
-original rear corner bumpers (rare on a standard)
-flat horn button
-tail lights
-correct semaphores (3 sets, one set very nice)
-25hp engine (not in bus at the moment)
-original crashbox trans
-extra KM speedo in excellent condition
-five 16" rims
-extra set of brake drums
-original '51 parts manual (very rare)
-'53 or '54? workshop manuals
Etc...etc...etc...

This is a Euro spec bus and I do have it's birth certificate from VW.  
Chassis # is 20-29105

Looking to do quick sale on this bus.  If nobody is interested here in the 
next 3 days, I will be listing it on ebay. I'm looking for offers over 
$6,000.  Please DO NOT email me with offers lower than $6,000.  Bus is 
located near Ann Arbor, Michigan USA.  Email me for pictures if seriously 
interested.
