Subject: re:protecting fuel line

you could probably get at it without pulling the engine, you would need to
be fairly flexible, and willing to work in small spaces, and get
greasy...then again if you bought a VW i think you need to be willing to do
that anyway.

the only thing that might be hard is securing the grommet type thing, as
accessing the fuel line from the other side of the engine tin would be very
difficult.
