Subject: RE: [VB] Filter pump evaluation

Steve,
I've run the 30mm filtered pumps from CB and from J.C. Whitney, (the same
pump), and have run across the same problems. The beauty of a filtered
system is getting that damaging debris out of your oiled before it harms
something. The problem with them is the filter itself. It creates a block
for the oil flow, and the tighter the mesh of the filter materials, the more
it slows up the oil flow and lowers your pressure. 

I found that you need to do two things with these pumps:

1) wet sand down the filter cover pump plate to get correct clearance and
proper pressure. Check and see of the gears are within 2-3 thousands of the
body surface where the plate mounts. If not, sand that area down. I use a
large piece of 400 grit wet sand paper on a thick piece of glass. 
2) change to another foreign car filter with a less dense mesh. I have used
Mazda filters for the B2600 engine with success.

Anytime you slow down the oil flow you decrease the amount of heat your
cooler(s) can get rid of. Adding a 1" sump will increase the amount of oil
you have, but even that will heat up if you cannot pump enough of it fast
enough through the cooler(s).

The tin issue I dealt with by nibbling a hole in the right spot no larger
than what was needed. It was a necessary evil. Either you wanted that pump
and was willing to make whatever mods you had to make it fit, or you mod
your block for full flow and set up a different system.

The muffler issue was dealt with by installing a header and a single QP
muffler. Like I said, if you really want that pump, you have to make
concessions.

Subject: [VB] Filter pump evaluation


When I built my motor last year I wanted to run a filter.  I though that
a filter pump would be an easy way to do it and not have all the extra
hoses to deal with.  With that in mind I procured one from CB
performance at the suggestion of Ronnie.  

Last week we had a bit of warm weather (105 one day and high 90's the
others).  After about 30 minutes on the fwy the temps start to creep up
to where the Berg temp a stick starts to flicker.  The VDO says 205-210.
 No sizzling on the spit test, but getting close if I kept driving it. 
On cooler days she stays well under 210...usually around 190-200.

After almost 10K miles on my new, built by me, motor (sp1600 stock
exhaust) I have an observation about the filter pump made by CB
performance and how I'm running it.  

1.	Nicely manufactured seems to work fine.  I never have any pressure
issues even when hot.

2.	Needs clearancing on the external fins cast into the body to clear
the crank pully/tin

3.	They do NOT tell you that the pump WILL NOT WORK with a stock
exhaust
with out modifying either the pump (Eric & Barb suggest 	cutting and
rewelding the neck of the casting down aprox 45 degrees...I could find
no one willing to do this and I don't have a TIG machine) or the exhaust
(the heat riser tube must be cut and re routed to give the filter
room...not an easy task either!).  This is the way I went.

4.	If rerouting the heat riser tube about the only filter you can use
is
a short small diameter BMW 2002 filter.  Small I know, but hey it works
just fine for the BMW.

5.	Once you have the pipe re welded, you have a very limited space (I'd
say 1/8") between the side of the filter and the pipe itself.  I've used
some turbo heat shielding and wrap a sheet between the filter and the
exhaust.

6.	If you run a real Westy hitch, you have to remove the left side wing
to get the filter out (not a big deal I know).


7.	The filter is directly in the path of the out flowing air
immediately
after it exits the left side cylinders.  The curved under cylinder tin
angles the air right at the filter.


My question is this:  Could the combination of higher than normal
outside temps, coupled with the proximity of the filter to the exhaust
and the heated 3/4 cylinder air hitting it be causing my temps to go
up??   I stuck my hand up there after I got off the freeway and its like
a hair dryer on steroids blowing right at the filter.  I forgot to
mention that I have a doghouse cooler but not running a T4 or the tight
finned T3.  Suggestions?

Thanks.

Steve
