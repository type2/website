That just totally sucks!  My condolences to the Pat.  I too noticed a fuel
smell in my 67 Crew cab.  I never did find any real leaks, but I think the
shop that installed the engine used vacuum line instead of fuel line.
Replacing all of the fuel lines stopped the smell.

Thanks for the shock treatment!
