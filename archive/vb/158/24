 I Have to leave my bus & oval outside this winter,
it's not a choice I like to make, always had a shop
before moving here.
Where I live is Cold & mostly dry during the winter
it can get icy & some snow, high desert.

I checked on some of the products,I'm sure some of you
have used different type's, whats your opinions?
