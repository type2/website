Subject: Re: [VB] electric fuel pumps

Hey Chuck,

I recommend the rotary non-FI pump available from dune 
buggy suppliers or is there a junk-yard type that's 
equivalent?
Others have said that the solid state unit makes a lot 
of noise. 
Mount it to an outrigger under the tank because it's a 
pusher not a sucker. Tank -> filter -> pump -> carbs. 
The '63 DC had it near the engine and caused problems 
when the tank was less than half full. Truck tanks are 
very low so it may not be a problem on a bus.
