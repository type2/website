Hi Steve,
We monitored two engines before installing a filter/oil pump and after 
without any noticable increase in engine oil temp in all seasons of weather.  
Thusly we never bothered with shielding the filter.  Sounds like your oil 
temps are normal compared to ours with referance to outside temp.  The 
pushrod tubes directly below the heads and cylinders have oil flowing in them 
being cooled by the hot air that is not as hot as the oil in them.  Plus the 
most of the lower rear of the engine and oil pump cover are near proximity to 
the muffler.  On top of all of this the much better designed and robust type 
4 engine has its stock filter in nearly the same postion!
  You might want to try the type 4 cooler and Porsche upper pulley to see if 
that helps.
