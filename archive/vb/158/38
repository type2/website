Groovy. I'm too lazy tonite to go do the math, but it appears you
are seeking lower CR as you increase bore size with this theory,
and have three different CR values for these three engines.
Longevity ( a good thing ) is sacrificing horsepower ( another good thing ).
You have stated your preferences for CR with factory parts tolerances.
Would you be willing to offer a little more power to the blueprinter ?
