Paul,
I bend and clamp a piece of brake line along the frame and up to the front
sheet metal and up to the tank. I interface that with a short piece of
braided fuel line to the tank and to the steel fuel line coming out the hole
of the front tin that comes through a 5/8" grommet.

On my own vehicles I like to mount a bulkhead fuel line receiver and clamp
the mate to the short piece of braided line that is on the frame mount brake
line/fuel line. That way you can quick disconnect without squirting fuel all
over.

How do you connect the brake line to the tank?  Their is a fitting at the
bottom of the tank, is it just a case of flaring the line and using the
current fixing?
How far should the fixed line come through the tin?
I guess replacing the line with metal is probably the best idea - VW
wouldn't of done it if it wasn't necessary.

Thanks

Paul
