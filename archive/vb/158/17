Hi Thomas,

My eurospec 67 turn signal lights only come on when you use the switch...
not when you turn on the lights.

Thomas asked>> Do the turn signal lights on a 66 bus come on when you engage
your parking
lights or headlights? Or do they only come on when you engage your turning
signals left or right or when you run your emergency flashing?
