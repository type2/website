Subject: pressed bumper questions

hi, can somebody please educate me about the differences between pressed
rear bumpers, like barndoor / post barndoor, or are all of them the same?
I bought a rear metal pressed bumper that was supposed to have come off
of a 56 westy and would like to know how to tell if it might be a
barndoor part ( don't some 56's have some barndoor parts? ) I am thinking
about using it on a 60 or 61 bus ( I know, I know, but I like how they
look : )  is there any reason this won't fit right. also, it came with
only one bracket and one driver's side splash pan. where the bracket fits
into the backside of the bumper only the middle of the bracket touches
the bumper while there is about 3/8" gap between the bracket and bumper
at the top and bottom. is this normal or should the bracket touch the
bumper at the top bottom and middle all at the same time? everything
seems to be pretty straight.
 tia for any info
