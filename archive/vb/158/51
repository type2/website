Subject: 1950-1962 Bentley

   I just got my confirmation from Bentley on these new manuals. These will
not be released for general public sale till October, the Jerome Jamboree is
the offical DEBUT. I am recieving 14 (I now have 12 left) copies for pre
sale. If anybody would like to get one at the Jerome pre sale price of 88.00
dollars (retail $109.00), please call (928) 680 7664 to give me your CC
info. All orders that are pre paid and  not picked up at Jerome will be
shipped on Monday following Jerome Jamboree. 1141 pages of pure pre 1963 bus
info compiled from all manuals from 1950 till 1963.
