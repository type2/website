Many high-wing airplanes have only one pump.  Gravity feed is the backup.

We tried this on a Ch*vy and had vapor lock problems due to a restriction
in the electric pump.  The pump was added near the tank to speed tank
switching and prevent vapor lock.  It worked fine when the pump was on,
but when off it vapor locked badly.  I finally replumbed it to simply
refill the main tank rather than feeding the engine directly.

You could do a bypass with a check valve.
