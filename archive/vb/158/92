How do you connect the brake line to the tank?  Their is a fitting at the
bottom of the tank, is it just a case of flaring the line and using the
current fixing?
How far should the fixed line come through the tin?
I guess replacing the line with metal is probably the best idea - VW
wouldn't of done it if it wasn't necessary.
