    Wonderful setup Ronnie!  Are you going to need side stabilizers/bigger
shocks in case you roll over to the edge of the platform????

 Sorry I'm going to miss youse guys at Jerome.  Last minute schedule
conflict that I can't get out of.  But my SC canopy for the raffle
SC/auction? should be there.  Mailed it to Jon Stanton this am.  Notice the
vintage nazi correct color hardware now included as standard on all my
canopies.

Grin!
