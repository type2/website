Another tip is to use brake line in place of the original fuel line.  It's
thicker.  For the tin grommet, I use a 2-inch-wide piece of inner tube
rubber wrapped around and around the line until it is slightly larger than
the tin hole  Shove it through the hole and you have a long-lasting,
fail-safe grommet.  I've used the current one for 5+ years and it is still
in good shape, and if it fails it will start on the outside end where it
is visible.
