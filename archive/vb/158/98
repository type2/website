Wild guesses:  1.  Instead of useless air being blown where you don't
need it, when you have the "heat" on you are bringing air away from
the engine compartment, which contributes to cooling.

2.  You do not do this when the ambient temperatures are high, so
perhaps it is less a problem in the winter?

3.  The heat exchangers should still keep the pressure high inside
the shroud; this might not be the case with open hoses.


Again, these are only my uneducated guesses.
