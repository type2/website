Subject: RE: [VB] Re: electric fuel pumps

Since we're on electric fuel pumps I have a related question.  I fly
airplanes and there are always two fuel pumps, a mechanical one on the
engine and an electric one on the fuel line, the redundancy is obviously
necessary in airplanes.  I plan to rebuild my engine this winter and
currently have an electric fuel pump.  I was contemplating reinstalling the
stock fuel pump and was curious if I could leave my electric pump in its
current location but switch it so it only runs if I throw the switch (back
up fuel pump).  I don't know however if the fuel will flow through the pump
if it is not switched on and/or if it's on would it push the fuel through
the stock pump if the stock pump had failed.  Any ideas???

Thanks.  Don

The directions on a couple of different electric fuel pumps I've installed
want the pump to be close to the tank, although this is not super-critical
on a Bus since the engine and tank are so close together.

If the pump comes with any rubber bushings or grommets for the mounting,
use them.  It will help cut down on the noise transmitted into the
bodywork.  The nice Holley pump I have used had a mounting bracket
exactly like the one for a stock VW ignition coil, except it had rubber
bushings where the mounting screws went.
