Ya, me too. But the question at hand concerns your choice
of low ( and even lower ) CR for engine longevity. So, OK, then-
Just how low can you go ? Should a big bore engine be tuned
to run on kerosene ? ( A 1641 is not a big bore, it's an overbore:).
What is your "optimal " CR,  why does it lower for bore increase ,
and what is the approximate optimal length of life for the chosen CR ?
