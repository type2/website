Subject: Re: [VB] Filter pump evaluation

Thanks for the total picture on the installation.  We do not have any 
filter setup but we have T4 cooler mod and still have temps has or 
higher than you indicated but cool down is faster.  It does take at 
least the half hour or more for the heat soak of the whole under side of 
the bus.  Do you have any pics of the mods?
P & C

 I procured one from CB performance at the suggestion of Ronnie.
