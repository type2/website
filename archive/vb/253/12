yup. i have a photo from a manual that was mailed to me (clara? e&b?) 
showing the snazzy barndoor setup: a lil chrome hole and cover (like 
the gas filler door's); the driver is putting a long rod with a slot 
at the end thru the hole... he grabs the lever on the fuel tap with 
the slot and turns it to get the reserve!  if i can find the scanner 
(everything is packed up right now) i'll post it up.
me, i just crawl under and swing the lever by hand.

Can a barndoor tap be operated by the cable

yes and yes.
  you will need to cut out and weld in a bracket arrangement from a 
splitty to make it work in a bay... or fab one from scratch.
you also need to route the cable thru a hole you make in the cab.
but it can be done.


>Do both early and late taps have the same thread for the tank?
they must - the barndoor tap screwed right on my 70 tank.

see the library - there should be a writeup on getting fuel hose from 
tank to pump, and the bulkhead fitting to make up.
