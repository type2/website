Subject: Re: [VB] Cutting fiberglass - speakin' of air tools

I have a compressor (6 hp) and a few air tools but not many.  What is the best
tool for cutting sheet metal.  I've used a cut off wheel and a nibbler but I
own neither.  Which is the better tool?

TIA

  if you don't have air tools you can use a jigsaw or hacksaw  hope this helps
oh use fine tooth.
