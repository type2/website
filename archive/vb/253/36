Dirt simple theory of priorities for vehicle ownership:

Consider the following 3-D plot of vehicle qualities.

Vehicles near the top of the chart are shiny and have good upholstery.
Vehicles near the bottom have deteriorated paint and seats.
Vehicles on the left are owned mostly for fun to play with.
Vehicles on the right are owned for transport, hauling stuff, etc.
Vehicles near the back are well maintained and worn parts are replaced.
Vehicles near the front may be dangerous and parts may fall off.

My vehicles tend to be toward the back, a little right of center
and, time and money permitting, near the top.  (some are still
near the bottom though)

Rusty Van Bondo's referenced show bug is a little too far to the
left for me but one man's toy is another man's monstrosity.
