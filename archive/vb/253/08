Subject: RE: [VB] fuel taps

Hi Volks,
I was told that barndoor taps are manually operated and that the later 
ones worked with the cable from the cockpit.
Which prompts another few questions:

Can a barndoor tap be operated by the cable?
Do both early and late taps have the same thread for the tank?
Do we need to use some sort of adapter in case we go to a 68-71tank?

And, last but not least, an ancillary question:

The other day i changed the fuel line from the tank to the metal hose 
at the engine, and didn't see a good way to route it. Now it's running 
forward from the tank to the lip where the belly pan meets the  arched 
pan, along the lip, over the hump, continues along the lip, and then 
runs back to the metal line, over the heater plenum (heat exchanger). 
It runs/hangs really close to the plenum, and i don't like it. Where is 
it supposed to go? No clips or hangers are visible, and i can't imagine 
it should be as haphazard as what i have done.

Thanks,
Andres
