Hi Andres,
For 40HP and later upright engines:
The fuel line from the tank goes through a flexable fuel line for about 6".  
Then it is attached to a metal fuel line that is held to the underside of the 
gas tank shelf above the tranny by two sets of sheet metal clips like the 
clips that hold the electrical harness to the fan shroud.  Then the back to 
flexable fuel line for another 6 or so inches to where it meets a metal fuel line 
coming out of the forward engine tin through a very hard rubber grommet.  This 
metal fuel line passes on the left side of the fan shroud where it is held by a 
bracket 311 127 525 unfortunitly rarely seen to today in most VWs.  This 
bracket reduces fuel line vibration and holds it so it does not rub on other parts 
of the engine like the intake manifold and left heat riser tube.  The metal 
fuel line continues to the fuel pump where for the early half of the 1960s this 
threaded directly in the fuel pump, later it was connected by another section 
of flexable fuel line.
