Hi Tom,
We were there!  Though we had to leave about 1010, only ten minutes after the 
public got in.  So we could proceed West the 350 miles, seven and a half 
hours home before it got too late for a Sunday night before a workday.  Did not 
find any fantastic buys, but did find some dealer training film/record sets!
