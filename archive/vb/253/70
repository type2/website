Subject: Re: [VB] dual carbs on a 1600cc

thanks eric,


yeah im building a 1776 for my truck for that application, im real happy with
the overall performance of my 1600cc....im probably going to still add the
carbs for some extra power...when its time to rebuild the 1600 il go bigger, I
only have 14k on this engine.
