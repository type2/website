I ended up going to buy some more flat black spray paint today. This 
time I got Rustoleum. I figured out the cheapo stuff I got before was 
"fast dry" paint and was causing me problems. The rustoleum did the 
trick. The truck now has a good enough flat black paint job.

My wife decided to come home with the kids today instead of 
tommarrow. So I just went ahead and got the wires hooked back to the 
fuse box the way their supposed to go (as best as I could). I went to 
install the headlights and dropped one...it broke the glass of the 
assembly.....DARN! It looked so good too! I installed it anyway and 
was more carefull with the other.

While I was at Wal-Mart I picked up a couple of the cheap trailer 
lights. I use the housing for these older busses. The holes for the 
housing lines right up with the holes for the stock taillight lenses. 
So from the outside of the bus you'd never know what was going on. 
This is easier for me than refurbing the taillight fixtures. I save 
the originals for a bus that "needs" the originals. I installed a set 
of cracked original glass lenses.

When my wife got here and settled in, I went outside and drove the 
truck around to the front. I made her come out and look. She was good 
enough about it and I could tell she thought it was looking kinda 
cool.

So now I gotta get this electrical system figured out. The key starts 
the engine. The turn signals and headlights are hooked up, but the 
taillights aren't. I don't get any headlights or turnsignals when I 
try them. Also don't get a horn. Time to started working down the 
wires and figure out where the power goes to and where it doesn't.

I posted a sneak peek of the budget rattle can "rat rod" black paint here:

I'll take better pictures of it when I'm done.
