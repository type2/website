Subject: Bend Oregon, 58 Bus

Any one from the Bend area get a chance to see this
bus?
While on the monthly shopping trip, a friend who lives
there.
Showed me the listing from the Bend Bulleitin, the 
people where moving to Montana.
Many VW Parts & a 58 bus. I made the call on Monday,
but as the sayin goes.....day late.... dollar short.
