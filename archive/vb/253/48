Hey everyone,
   My truck is about to go to the shop for paint and final assembly and I 
need a couple of things before it goes. Does anyone have:
                               
                                     1. the brackets that hold the front seat 
down (I lost one, so I might as well get a matched set, match-mine did'nt 
match)
                                     2. a new fresh air knob (black bakelight 
I think?)
                                     3.a center brakelight and assembly for 
the early 57

                                       Any help will be greatly appreciated.
