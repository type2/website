Subject: tires again

 I have been able to purchase 3, 15 " bus rims. I was planning on putting
two one the back and keeping the currrent
15" bug rims on the front, until I can locate the last one. Any problem
doing that? I was going to keep one 15" bug rim for a spare. Lastly a local
tire guy recommended using 15  X  75 X 205's onthe bus rims
comments please
