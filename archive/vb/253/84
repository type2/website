Subject: Swing to IRS

Howdy! this is my first time for help. If I have messed up let me know.
Anyway, this is what I need help on. I have a 1965 Deluxe with a swing axle,
and I have a  wrecked 70 bus with an IRS, and I want to convert the swing axle
on the 65 to the IRS from the 70. In other words, I want to take the whole
rear axle of the 70 and put it on the 65. Can this be done? and what problems
will I encounter? If anyone has done this project, let me know what you did.
Thanks, jam in el paso.
