Hi Craig,

I liked that assemble it reversed idea!

I 404'd (not found error) on the obsolete docs page, but i'll keep 
trying the archives, probably haven't yet hit on the search terms that 
will yield fruit.
Thanks for all the help, i had a nice long ride home in the bus tonight 
and thought of all the listees helping to keep these critters rolling 
all over the world...

G'night,
Andres
