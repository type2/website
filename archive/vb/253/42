Subject: camper window mounting

Well I finally got around to try and install the one westy style
camper window in my 66. The front double door was apparently damaged
at some point in it's past. Instead of a regular camper door I have a
delux door w/ pop out window. I picked up a window from Mark Dearing
(thanks Mark) and went to pull the pop out tonite. Got that out with
no problem, but apparently I don't have all the parts needed. I took
off the other one & there appeared to be some sort of extra "frame"
that actually holds the window there. What is this piece & does anyone
have one laying around?

I'm assuming that the delux door will accept this window with this
frame,but someone please let me know if this isn't correct. TIA
