Hi All,
Anyone know whether a early fuel tap 211 209 021A for barndoors or 
later tap 211 209 021E will work on the 68-71 tanks? I'm trying to 
decide whether to keep my tank (stock 211 201 055 80mm neck, currently 
without valved tap) or go to a later 68-71 tank. I like the early one 
because of the little filter bowl, but there's probably a good reason 
they went to the later one...
If i keep my tank, can i put the barndoor tap in?
Thanks,
Andres
