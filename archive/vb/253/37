Subject: abandoned bus in buffalo

i found a bus today that was abandoned near buffalo, ny a couple years ago.
it is a white 62 sundial camper last registered in az in 98.  it has "sex wax"
logos on both sides towards the rear between the upper vents and the belt
line.  its a fairly solid and complete bus minus the front seat bulkhead being
cut out.  i originally heard about it thru a friend who talked to the guy
whose land it was left on.  the guy told him it was a 54.  i knew it was
pretty impossible to just find a barndoor sitting around, so i went to see it
for myself and its definitely a 62.  anybody on the list know anything about
this bus?
thanks!
