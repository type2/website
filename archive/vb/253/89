Subject: Re: [VB] Swing to IRS

I've got the CE "arms" under my 66 now.  I can tell you to make sure you
check everything 3 and 4 times.  I got it square and the distance between
the arm mounts right but ended up with one replacement arm off level.  This
caused the wheel to have negative camber.  I've bought a set of control arms
(69-70 Bus style) with eccentric (spelling?) bushing that give me enough
adjustment to get it out, or at least have both sides with a very slight
negative chamber, like most lowered Buses.

There's a company in the UK that will sell just the mounts to use with stock
arms and then you modify the under side of the bus.  They're volksheaven I
believe.  Kruisnwagen has a nice setup from
Australia.  http://www.kruizinwagon.com.au/

Some time ago there was a posting on Samba from a UK guy who cut the "arms"
from the tube back to the u mount out.  Welded on a Control Arm bracket and
made his own IRS using Bus arms and hubs.
