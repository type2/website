I didn't think we could tow such a weight with a four cylinder
motor...aircooled at that.

Hi Robert,
It will tow fine IF you first go through the suspension first.  Meaning 
complete repacking and greasing of front end and changing and filling the
tranny 
and RGBs with new gear oil.  Plus a new or a good set of tires.  Lastly make

sure the tranny is in nuetral and the E-brake is released before towing!
Though 
we would keep the towing speed to 60 MPH or less because the higher the
speed 
the quicker things can get out of hand, IE getting hit by a powerfull 
sidewind.
