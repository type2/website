Rex,
I like your style but I hope you don't mind me saying
that you have a death wish!
Your wife must be a real patient lady.
I stripped a 30 PICT 2 in the living room today
because it was about 7 degrees C outside and I could
see my breath and my good lady wife was fine with
that.
But when I was mourning about the fact that another
friend managed to pick up a late 50's SC and a early
60's Standard bus in o.k. nick $500 for the lot
(despite the fact they both had no engines & had spent
the last 15 years in an orchard) she started to look
quite surly and I stopped complaining lest she pull
the brakes on the current project, a 67 Panel.
If you need to get rid of a few in a hurry and they
run let me know.
I'll take them off your hands while you negotiate the
gun out of your wife's hands :o)
Keep waging that campaign...I admire your gumption.
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
