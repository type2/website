Had to send seller props as it reminds me alot of my old 63 EZ camper. It looks
to be in good shape and priced fairly for what I see as this current market.

Looking fwd to finishing the big pile of home improvement projects so as I can
cobble together the turkis 63 EZ that I currently have rotting on the back
porch.

If in FLA or in the SE USA then give this one consideration.
Peace,
