Subject: RE:Clutch Cable ?

I adjusted the cable last night.  I think it is just breaking in or 
something.  It really doesn't get loose and there isnt any play in the 
pedal, it just gets harder to shift.  IT only takes about 1-2 turns on the 
wingnut to cinch it back up.  I also installed a new oil sender from 
auto-zone.  This thing is huge I didn't have a socket or wrench that would 
fit over it, ended up vice gripping it on.  It's not leaking at least.  My 
new door handle arrived today and I put that on too, it is a little bit 
shorter than the original one, but it works.  Also the keys it came with 
stink, they are shaped like a house key and have this big rubber thing over 
it.  So lets see, I have 1 key for the driver and passneger door, 1 key for 
my hatch, 1 key for my engine lid and another key for the cargo doors, oh 
and I still haven't gotten that new ignition switch, that will be another 
key as well.  So thats 5 keys.  I gotta remedy that.  Who was that VW 
locksmith in TX?

On another note,  I have gotten www.sundial-camper.com up and running again. 
  Added a new forum that I have been using on another site, looks good.  I 
need to redo the site, still.  So those of you who have some of that rare 
sundial literature, scan it in and send it to me.  I'll send you a sundial 
camper logo sticker and maybe even a t-shirt.
