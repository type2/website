Subject: Re: [VB] dual carbs on a 1600cc

I've got a single 32/36 on my bus and it definitely adds a good bit of 
oompf.  Was thinking of trying the 38 DGAS and see what that does for me. My 
petronix II died and that was definitely noticable.  When I get another I'll 
try the DGAS.  With 3.44 gearing the 16 has a little trouble pushing it, but 
I'm an old hotrod guy.  Could allways turbo it! :)
