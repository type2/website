Are these the ~3" round kind, ~4" square kind (Petersen Manufacturing

You're pretty lucky.  If I were you I'd have a Westy in the stable,
so if the "surpise" didn't work out, you'd still have a place to sleep...

I remember you said that the truck seems to have the '62-'64 harness
in it, but I don't remember about the fuse box.  The stock '60 has
two less fuses than a '62 (the low beams weren't fused) which might
have engendered creativity on the part of the PO.  Hopefully they
would have just spliced the low-beam wires together, but they may
have left the tail light or battery+ignition fuse pairs off the fuse
box and handled those in creative ways.
