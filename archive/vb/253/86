I have done something similar, but with a kit from Bus-Boys.
After doing the job and spending enough time under later buses I figured 
that if I were to ever do it again, I'd try and go the junk yard route.

Some concerns.

1. Transmission, If I remember correctly, that trans mount from the top 
rather than the bottom, it may still be made to fit OK.
2. trailing arms.  You'll have to unbolt these from the '70 bus and then 
cut the brackets out to use in your bus.  This will be the most critical 
stage as the alignment will depend upon how well you cut the pieces out and 
then reweld them to your bus.
3. spring plates should bolt right up.
4. Shock mounting, you may have to relocate the top mounting point for the 
shocks.
5. Brake lines, redo from center section out.

The 65 trans "can" be converted to IRS but cost????

Don't forget, this conversion will drop the rear of the bus 2 or 3 inches 
so unless you drop the front a corresponding amount, you have a BSB  (butt 
saggin bus).

The kit I used kept the bus pretty much at stock height, but at an expense 
of using more expensive CV joints.

I'm sure there are plenty of other issues, but that should get you started.
