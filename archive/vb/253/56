Subject: Engine Removal

Good Morning All,
I am attempting to remove the engine from a 60 DC.  I did not think in
advance that it would be different from a bay window.
So, I am covered in dirt, awaiting a little advice.
I assume there are 4 bolts??  I have found 2, inside a bracket that looks to
the tranny mount. and possibly on behind the shroud, ala the bay window
where the starter bolts on through the firewall.
Is there another?

Beep Beep,
