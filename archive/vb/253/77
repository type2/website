Subject: Spokane BugFair - woohoo!

I entered the '58 panel in it's first VW show this weekend.  It took 5th in
the daily driver class.  I was pretty happy with the outcome.  A little more
work and next time around I should do a bit better.  It was also my first VW
event.  I had a blast!  Thanks to all the volks at the RCVW club that put on
the event.  When I get the film back I will post some pics on TheSamba.com for
all to see!  Anyone else on the list attend the Spokane BugFair?
