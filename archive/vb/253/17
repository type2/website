Subject: travel postcard from P & C

our friends p & c posted a travel card on the 'net.  i thought y'all would like to see what they are up to as of 6/12.

We found an internet connection here in Effingham, Illinois, so it is 
time for the travel postcards.  They are posted at

We are here in Effingham for a VW Funfest this weekend. Should be about 
300 VWs if the rain stays away.  We have had a little rain and it has 
helped keep the temperatures down but not us.  We stayed a couple days 
with friends of a cousin's in Kansas Oklahoma.  Philip had a chance to 
change the oil and adjust the valves and Catherine cleaned out the rig 
and got caught up on laundry and other chores.  But Catherine also got 
to go horseback riding and yes she went out racing quarter horses as you 
can tell by the bruise on her chin.  Nothing broken and she had a nice 
ride.  See Catherine's goatee on the postcard.  :(>  

Have not decided the next direction or next stop.
