Subject: bus does not ilde - IT DOES NOW!!!!! - But I have a ??

For all of you that have been following my idle problem, I think i have fixed
it, or at best tuned around it.  I bought a used Brosol 30/31 carb at the swap
meet this weekend.  It looked in very nice shape.  Put it on the bus and did a
little twaeking and it started to idle!  Woohoo!  Now here is my question...

When I was tinkinging I had inadvertently placed my hand on top of the carb
blocking the airflow (man those thing have some suction!)  After I quickly
removed my hand, the idle picked up and the engine smoothed out.  But after
about 20 seconds it would go back to an uneven idle and drop in RPMs.  So this
got me thinking, I put my fingers on top of the carb in the shape of a V and
blocked about 2/3 of the surface area.  The engine ran better.  smooth, even
idle.  Does this mean the my mixture is too lean?  I have been running w/o and
air cleaner (it did not come with one, it's on the shopping list) could that
be part of my problem?  The bus does idle regardless, but I just thought that
was a little wierd.  Any thoughts?  Of course now that the bus idles, the
throttle cable seems to be stickingm that should not be too difficult to fix
(I have heard that before)

Sorry to be long winded. Any help would be great.  Thanks again.
