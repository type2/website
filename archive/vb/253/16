I'm sorry i wasn't too clear. I'm in a 61 bus, but talking about 
fitting an old (barndoor or later splitty) tap in either my current 
standard tank or in a later 68-71 tank.
It seems both taps work, i have to decide whether to use the later tap 
sans cool filter or earlier tap and fabricate some kind of adapter to 
be able to use my fuel tap control plunger in the cabin.

The fuel hose routing question is still out there... The library has 
lots of detail in that area referencing bay busses.
I'm sorry to say that i never looked to see how my old 62 SC was 
plumbed there.
Good thing some smart previous owner (SPO) had probably changed out the 
hose.
Or else the gods took pity on a fool like me.

thanks,
