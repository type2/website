Subject: Drive safe!

  Hopped in the DC yesterday morning to head to work. 
When I turned on the radio the traffic guy was reporting 
on fatal crash- a VW Bus had rear-ended a semi truck.
  It's always sad to hear about these, even more so when 
a fellow bus driver is involved. When I got to work 
there was a message from Lisa making sure it wasn't me. 
If any Fresno people know who the victim was please let 
me know.
  Please careful out there! We want to see you all again 
at future meets!  

Take care
