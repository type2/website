texas capitol cop pulled me over for a dead taillight... held the
flashlight while i wiggled the wire.

austin city cop pulled me over on campus  for 'expired tags...'   despite
NEW TAGS ON LICENSE and my receipt in the glove box from the previous WEEK.
was SORELY disappointed when he found i'm 'clean.'

state trooper frowned at me when g. bush caravan passed me on way to
airport after stealing election and i flipped it off... but he had bigger
fish to fry, and drove off after it.
