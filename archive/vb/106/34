Subject: Re: [VB] Body work tool -- shrinking

Here is a page that briefly describes it.

http://www.type2.com/library/body/shrink.htm

Shinking is done with a stud gun using a special shrinking tip. You just
press the tip to the area you want to heat and press the trigger and it
heats the area to a red glow. After this, use air to cool the area to cause
the area to shrink.
