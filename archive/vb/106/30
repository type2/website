Subject: Re: [T2] Gas and lights

This brings to mind a question I had about running original VW intake valves
with regular gas in a 36hp motor. IF I remember right I have read that any
vw running stock valves produced since 67 or 68 where fine, or that   the
newer aftermarket valves where fine.  When I ordered valves from bfy  the
exaust valves looked good but the intakes looked to be of marginal quality
and I had three different brands between the 4 valves. It was recomended
that I run the ones that where in the motor in place of them as they still
looked to be in decent condition once they where cleaned up. But now I
wonder about compatability with unleaded fuels
