From my VW Theology Library: According to St. Berg, the steel seats and =
brass guides were used from the start. It was the introduction of hard =
chrome valve stems on the exhaust valves that made the heads compatable =
with unleaded gas. Stainless steel valves also get the job done.

Hoping to attain enlightenment,

from the lead.  The valves may have changed too, but I think the valve
seats were the big change.
