Hi Al,
We do not like the electromagnetic cut off due to failing in closed position. 
 Otherwise if it works they are fine.  That should be the pilot jet, might be 
a bit too small since Without "Guesswork" lists a 65 there.

Would be interesting to take the fuel pump out of the loop and with a full 
gas tank run the engine.  We have done this several times when the pump died 
on us.  Just loop a section of hose from outlet to inlet of the pump to 
prevent fire and run the fuel line directly into the carb.

That should be 19.5 +/- 1

Definitely possible.

Hmm, for the type 2 the "Without Guesswork" lists a 140z air correction jet.  
Since you are using a 66 instead of a 68 air cleaner you might need a bit 
bigger jet to lean it out to proper fuel/air mixture.
We found the float wieght, which should be 8.5 grams.
Well sounds like you have made good progress!  Keep us informed.
