Subject: Re: Adjust Dual Carbs


	Well last week I was having problems with keeping my bus idling
to find out that it was the carb. So this weeks question is????? After I
removed that whole engine because of a bad rear main I put in a 1600DP
with Dual 34M Delortos. 
	
	Is there a good place of reference that shows how to tune these
things?  I have already looked at the archives but not a lot there. It
appears that that they are not burning all the fuel and missing on the 3
& 4 piston side. It still has more power than the single port pict 30
setup. These carbs are really clean and I think they just need a good
adjusting.

Any Information would Help. These are my first set of duals so there is
a learning curve here.

And thanks to all that helped me last week with my idling problem!
