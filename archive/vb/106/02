Subject: Weber 48 IDA Value????

I picked up a(just one) Weber 48 IDA, I dont know much about these carbs but
I hear they are pretty wicked. It is pretty clean , the shafts are tight and
it doesnt seem gunked up. It has short intake stacks on it but no intake
manafold. i was wondering the value on these for two reasons
if I want to aquire another and in case i decide to sell the one I have.
 Thanks,
 Bryan
