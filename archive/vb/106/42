 The engine lid prop for a '63 would be the same elbow-like thing as on my

 right? I've seen the later big spring type (on the '67) are there other

 than these two (broom handles and bungee cords excluded)?

ya- your early 54 takes the same engine lid prop used 3/55 through dec 64.   
in late dec 64 they used the spring to hold up the engine lid-  this was 
change at the same time they went form the pull front door handles to the 
push button kind.

BDs have a prop that looks a lot like the 3/55- early 64 kind, but slightly 
different as the angle is funny, but they are kind of rare.  the original 
ones are different than the later improved VW ones that you could get from 
the dealer later.
