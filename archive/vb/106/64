Subject: Re: [VB] didn't do so hot with kelly park

I have blown up about 3 of the cheap pulleys that you get aftermarket now a
days.  I now carry an NOS pulley that has the locking tabs, instead of the
cheap Double D cutout in the wheel (don't know what else to call the center
that fits to the generator, but it's flat on both sides).  Everytime I pull
an engine apart, I look for these Generator pulleys that have the two
locking tabs that lock the front pulley with the back pulley, and have only
found 3 in 10 years.  If you ever find these, keep em, they work great, and
don't strip/blow up, or at least none of mine have.

Later
Charles
