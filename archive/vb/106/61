Hi David,
Sounds like it could be the generator, regulator or battery.  Try the 
"Testing No-Load Voltage" in section E-2, page 3, and if you have the tools 
the "Testing Charging Current" on page 4.  Also check the generator 
commutator for dirtyness.  We had to rise a pair of brushes in gasolene once 
to keep them from carbon fouling the generator due to the brushes were oil 
soaked.
