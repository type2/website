Hi Al,
Hmm, could be your float is just too heavy.  We had that happen to our 63 SC 
and after going through the fuel pump and cabr we just replaced the float and 
all was well.

The fuel should be shut off by the valves in the fuel pump, but if not the 
shut off valve in the carb is the last defense against the fuel fillling the 
engine when the gas tank in buses (Not in SCs due to gas tank postioned lower 
than the carb!) are more than half full.

We have seen fuel pumps with a leak in the diaphram squirt fuel directly into 
the engine case.  This is best found out by unbolting the fuel pump from the 
engine case and hand pumping it with a screwdriver to see if fuel leaks out 
the bottom.

Slightly low float level probably would cause the shut off valve not to 
close.

According to our Bentley manual exploded diagram of the 30 PICT-3 carb should 
have the curve pointing rearward.
