I had a similar problem. Turned out somebody had but in slightly longer
lower shock bolts, that never could be tightened completely. Once replace
with the proper bolts, the clunk over every bump disappeared.

So my bus is running grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreat - but .... when I go over a bump
I hear a big clunk - sort of sounds like my transmission is loose or
something - or maybe a floor jack under my z-bed - anyone have any ideas as
to what I should look at??

hoses - whooo hoooo ;)
