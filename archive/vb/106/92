Hi Ric,
The ansewer is just not going to be easy.  You will just have to go through 
everything and make sure all is set properly.  This includes proper carb 
jetting for the size engine, air cleaner, muffler, and engine compartment, 
also proper timing of the distributor according to VOA standards for the 
distributor you are using, and RPMs you are driving, etc., etc.......
  As for you vibration.  Did you have the clutch pressure plate balance with 
the FW/crank?  If not you might need to remove the engine and rotate the 
pressure plate in relation to the FW one bolt at a time till all or at least 
most of the vibration goes away.
