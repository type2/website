Subject: [VB] Another mystery-spring around drum????????

Hello everyone,  I've got another  mystery.
 
I pulled off my right front tire to work on the brakes and there was a
spring wrapped around the outside of the drum.  What's this all about?  Help
dissipate heat?  I have no idea, so I slid it off and won't put it back on
unless any of you guys can think of why I'd need it.  Thanks,
