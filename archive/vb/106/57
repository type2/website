 it looks like I don't have the same kind of access to the back side. 
  There's two notches, but they don't appear to be all the way through to 
 the inner race.  How do I remove the inner race?

ya, there are slots there where you can use a punch to tap out the race- wipe 
out some grease and use a flashlight
