I haven't driven VWs long enough to have a brake cylinder fail on
me, but the one car I have had a failure in was also the right
rear.  It was a '79 Olds Cutlass wagon, 260 V8.

My guesses...

- The right rear has the longest line to the master cylinder.
  Therefore, more potential for gunk and goo to collect in this
  line.  It also takes longer for the fluid movement to get there,
  which might result in a shorter piston travel than the other
  wheels, hence concentrating the wear in the middle of the
  cylinder. 

  This may not be true for splitties because of the way they are
  plumbed (single line to the back that tees to both wheels) but
  it's true in most American cars.

- Something about the differential and torque in RWD cars causes
  the right rear brake shoes to adjust themselves differently
  than the others; most probably further out towards the drum
  making it easier for a piston to pop out of one end of the
  cylinder. 

- On LHD vehicles, the right wheels are the curb wheels and go
  over more grates, potholes, tree limbs, etc.  More bumps and
  vibration lead to quicker failure.

- Sunspots.
