Hi,

Just as long as someone doesn't go out there and dismember perfectly 
good busses I'm OK with it.

The bus I described in an earlier post had it's rear frame sectioned out 
by a trike "specialist". He wanted the rear frame plus trans/engine for 
a project. Welded the combo to a couple of forks, and away he went. Now 
if you find some of those, have at it.

BTW, if you see a decent front cab floor pan let me know. ;-)
