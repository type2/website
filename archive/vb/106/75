Subject: Oil Press warning buzzer

I've been wanting to do this for awhile. When I'm sitting back while driving
I can't see the oil light, so today I went to radio shack and picked up a
12V buzzer for $6.99. Once I figured out I needed to run power from the fuse
box and ground thru the oil light everything worked out great! I just
mounted the buzzer with some wire ties. I used some VW connectors (those
plastic covered things) to keep everything nice and neat and not cut into
any of the stock wires.
I thought about running some kind of delay so it wouldn't come on right away
when I turned on the key, but I would rather know immediately if and when I
lose pressure.
I used to keep my eye on that light as much as I did on the road when on
long trips. Now it will be nice to focus on the road knowing I'll have an
audible warning if something happens.
