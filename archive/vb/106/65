My experience is that pulleys blow-up because the incorrect number of shims
are used when installing a new pulley.

If too few shims are used, it causes the pulley to flex on each revolution
of the engine and fatigues the metal. If the metal is thin, the pulley will
fail quickly. If the metal is thick (as in the OE ones) it will take much
longer but, will also fail.

A rule of thumb I use is that I put enough shims in so that, by adding one
more will cause the belt to slip when turning the engine over using the
pulley nut.
