Was it around the nose of the drum, or around the body of the drum?
If it was around the body, I don't know.  If it was just around the
nose, would it have contacted the wheel or hubcap if they were on?
If so this might have been installed in an attempt to collect static
electricty from the wheels.  I've never seen such a device, but I
understand they look like springs on the wheel hubs that are meant
to contact the wheel or the hubcaps.  Page E-16 1 of the Bentley
mentions this but doesn't have a picture.
