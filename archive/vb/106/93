It is easy to have an additional switch to allow the radio to be on with the 
ignition off. Wire a double throw, single pole switch with the center wire to 
the switched power in to the radio. Wire one of the side wires to the 
ignition switch hot wire, and the other to an un switched hot wire. Don't 
forget to include fuses. Flip the switch one way and the radio is on with the 
ignition (use this as the default position). Flip the switch the other way, 
and the radio always is on. Remember to turn it off.

Modern radios have two power in wires. They need a small amount of power all 
the time to handle the station presets etc. This wire then handles the power 
needs for the radio amplifier circuits, so it needs to be able to handle full 
power. There is also a power input that is switched by the ignition.  Some 
also have an external input for the light in the radio to allow it to fade 
with the dash lights.
