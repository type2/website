Subject: re:por-15

i don't beleive you need to top-cout this stuff when applied under the body.
i called a local distributor about getting some to paint the underside of my
bus...he said i didn't need a topcoat.

currently i just have some surface rust under there, i thought i would paint
it with either the white or the grey por-15...that wya it would be easier to
see what is going on down there...i am thinking if i paint it witht he black
stuff-it will be harder to see under the bus...
