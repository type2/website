Hi Paul,
That is one area that would be hard to inspect throughly inside for rusting 
out of the lower section of the shock/beam.  So if there is surface rust 
through out the inside of there we would just replace the beam with a rust 
free one.  Too nasty of results if that crumbled up while doing 100 Km per 
hour!
  When you reinstall the front beam slather some grease on the beam and 
chassi surfaces that that bolt together to prevent rust from forming in the 
crack between these.
