Subject: FS Behind the Dash Air Conditioning System

I have a nearly complete behind the dash Air Conditioning System For
Sale. (No compressor/Needs three feet of hose)
It was working good and blowing cold when it was removed.
It fits 80-91 Vanagons, Air Cooled or Water Cooled. (Water cooled will
need compressor bracket)
It comes with the parts you see in the pictures.
It does not have a compressor but it has the mounting bracket for Type IV
Air Cooled.
It comes with one or both front coils, one for Air Cooled and One for
Waser Boxers, you get both or select one and save UPS.
The hoses will reach the engine bay but will need three feet of extension
hose with your compressor pressure fittings.
