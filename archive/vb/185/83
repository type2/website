Subject: POR15

I was intending on painting my sway bar and a couple of other bits with
POR15 black.  Do I need to topcoat these or will they be okay as they are?
The website says they are damaged by UV  light - but as they won't be in
direct sunlight I cannot see this being a problem.
I was also going to paint the underside of the front of my bus with POR15
and then spray bodyshutz on - do I need a top coat for this?

Thanks
Paul
