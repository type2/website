Subject: NEATO Voting, OBR

Finally rec my latest OBR and it has the latest BOD voting form in it. 9
openings and 9 people running. I say vote for each one and hope they will all
do what they say they will do. No Pres is a good idea, the last Pres did
what???. Looks like BOD's are slowly shifting to the western US. Good or Bad??
Will find out I guess. Many thanks to the few that do it all for NEATO.  MAKE
the chapters get involved or get rid of the chapter. MAKE the chapters give a
monthly report, MAKE the chapters get more involved (including the 1 I am in).
It's Make it or BREAK it time for NEATO.  My personal statements only. You 9 (
hope there's no recount )get tough and don't take any crap from any chapters,
Tell them to put up or get out and join SOTO ( a plug for Dave).
