POR-15 is fine for stuff that doesn't see sunlight, and it even
holds up OK on stuff does that does  see daylight.

I put the POR-15 on, then in about 15 minutes, while it's still tacky,
I mist on a light layer of paint.  When thsat's dry, I paint it the
rest of the way.  I don't like undercoatings; there's something inherently
dishonest about them.  Plus they flake off when yoou're trying to do stuff
under there.
