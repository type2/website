Yikes Rob, I'm guessing you had your fill of cynic pills today :-)
The thought did cross my mind about David getting that for Anna as a 
birthday present.
I know for a fact that I'd be signed up in an instant for that TV show if I 
were to do the same.  In fact, I could have a bidding war between all of 
those court shows.  My wife "tolerates" my VW hobby.  I've had the DC since 
Jan 1998 and in that time I think she has been in it all of twice.  I'm 
sitting here thinking how to convince her to come out to BBB this year, 
even thinking about compromising and checking into a nearby hotel.

Lets hope for David's sake that all goes well when Anna comes home. :-)

Scott
