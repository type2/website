Yup, I went, along with Tom Mink.

This was a great place is you were into late bugs, type 3's, or
late buses.  Several typ IV engine'd buses, intact for the asking.
There was a single solitary split, beat down and stripped.  He wanted
$500 for it, and it only had one wheel.

I grabbed a lot of little loose odds and ends; some 15" bus wheels,
a couple doghouse fan shrouds, a bus jack, some lug nuts, etc. Cost
me $40, and I sold a radio to someone on the spot (way too cheaply,
I'm told) for $20, so I'm out $20 for the adventure and parts.
