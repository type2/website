Subject: Happy ending

Hi All,

Its fixed... well almost... we ended up welding the out riggers to the
trailer, putting jack stands under the frame near the front bumper brackets,
and pulling it back together.  It worked flawlessly.  I still need to get a
frame section to repair the rotten spot and I think I've already located it.
The story is posted up on the web page:

I would like to take this time to thank everyone who sent me emails... the
support from this list is truly amazing.  My thanks go out to all and I'm
sorry if I didn't respond to all that did send me a email.  What an
emotional 3 days.

So, all that is left is the moment that I present the v80 to my wife.... I
guess I'm not out of the woods yet...


David
