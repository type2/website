  There is very limited grass camping. Once on the grass you cannot move the
BUS, if you move it you WILL NOT be allowed to bring it back on the grass.

  Camping on the GRASS is on a first come, first there basis and as I said
limited.
 
  There are NO FIRES, PERIOD!!!! on the grass, camp fires will be permitted
in fire pits that are OFF THE GROUND, so if you want your own fire, bring a
OFF THE GROUND fire pit.

  There is plenty of dirt camping and a  few nice secluded areas along the
channel and other private areas.

  For those that are scared of getting their BUS dirty, they are more then
welcome to camp on the asphalt. We will block off the first row just for
this.

  There is also an area (parking) for RV's for those that bring them and a
HOTEL is in walking distance.

  All the particulars for BBB VII will be on the web site when completed and
up in the next week WE HOPE

This looks like they are parked on the grass and the beach we though 
that was going to be a no no.
