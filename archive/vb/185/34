Dave-
 The wheel opening is smaller on the '62 than the '64. You probably could
use pieces for patching but if you want to replace the whole dog legg it
would be incorrect. '63 and later dog legs are repopped and easily
available. As far as the rest of the frame pieces they sould fit without any
problem. The main two body differences is the dogs and the flat rear wheel
wells. '63 and later have the flaired lip.
