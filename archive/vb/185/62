Subject: Hey, what is that?

Volkleagues,

I wuz bizzy breakin the Sabbath yesterday after a stirring 3 hour session of
Church.  decided to change the oil in the Lexus and My Sweet Bus.  Got the
Lexus done with no problem, but boy, my son really racheted the #$%! (hey,
it's Sunday!) oil filter on but good.  Made a messing getting it off, . . .
but I digress.  While swearing and winching away, I noticed a little something
on my Bergmann/Brazilian block.

My filter is fitted off the left side (from behind the bus) and below the
crank pulley.  While winching away at the stubborn filter, I noticed a huge
screwdriver slotted plug immediately to the right of the center of the engine
on the very back edge and corner of the central block.  What in the (-at-)#$%! is
that?

I know, I know, my question reveals a lot about my ignorance.  But hey, VW's
are sooo good and reliable that I've been driving them for almost 40 years and
have little mechanical experience with them.  Just keep 'em full of oil and
maintain the rev's within limit.

Best,

Curt
