How about Waxoyl:

http://www.hammerite-automotive.com/products/waxoyl.htm

It's like a mixture of mineral spirits, beeswax, and machine oil.  Very
popular with old British car fans, it appears.  Unfortunately it's not
quite as easily available as your local Home Depot.  You would need to
find a regional distributor.  (Like, there's a distributor in
Massachusetts where I got mine.)
