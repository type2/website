Hi Paul,
You bet!  It is the only way to get both rear shift rod bushings replaced and 
completely clean and regrease the shift coupler tube.  Make sure to also 
replace both rubber seals on the ends of this rear shift rod tube to keep out 
future dirt and water!

From the factory the lagging should only be from just behind the front beam 
backwards as can be seen in the VW bus shop manual in the front beam section. 
 Though it could be an aftermarket kit or DPO add on.
