Hi Ronnie,

  Since this question has come up many times in the past, and it is one of
the more pita parts of restoration (preservation is better,) and would
help many people actually believe that the heater does work, pls enlighten
us.

 I don't want to cut anything before I find out where to cut, can you or
someone who has done it and knows exactly where to cut...be so kind enough
pass on this vital information?

Best,
joe
