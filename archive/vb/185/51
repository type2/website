Okay, that will save me some money then as mine are as new.  Will I find the
trimming details in the archives, or could you give me some pointers of
where to start trimming?

Thanks
Paul

  As far as I have seen there are only 2 different wing vent seals made.
Fair and good. The fair ones are a generic Brazil and the good ones being
OEM made seals with the part number moulded in. If there are any others out
there I have not seen them. 
  I have purchased these seals from every VW supplier out there to compare
and they are all the same from the same manufacturer. There is some extra
trimming that has to be done to make them fit good and time and patience is
all that's needed. They WILL NOT fit without this extra work
