GET READY TO BRING IN THE NEW YEAR ..........in the best place one could
imagine......a Full Moon Bus Club Campout..

I apologize for not getting information out sooner,  but I am glad that I
have not posted the web page as of yet, because we WILL BE MOVING THE
LOCATION for the campout.

Previously the event was held at Camp Croft State Park.

NOW THE EVENT WILL BE HELD AT THE PINE RIDGE CAMPGROUND.  This campground is
located in the same town - Spartanburg, SC.  The folks at the State Park
were
let's say.....less than accommodating.  Plus, the facilities and the
campsites
are much nicer at the Pine Ridge Campground.....a private campground owned
by a nice Canadian couple that moved down South.

So here are the details.

DATES:  DEC 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 2002  and JAN 1, 2003
come and camp as many nights as you can, even if it is only new years eve.

WHERE:  PINE RIDGE CAMPGROUND - Spartanburg, SC
located near Walnut Grove Plantation

They are not very busy at this time of year, so we will almost have the
entire place to ourselves. You will not need to call and make reservations,
but you can if you like:  the campground phone # is: (864)576-0302.

DIRECTIONS TO CAMPGROUND:   Take I-26 away from Spartanburg (towards
Columbia, SC) and take Exit 28: HWY 221.   Take HWY 221 NORTH, approx. 200
feet to light, and turn right on "Stillhouse Road".  Go one mile to Stop
Sign and take left on "Ott Shoals Road"...go 1.5 miles and see campground
signs on the left.

If these directions don't help for where you live go to the link for the
campground. You can type in your departure city and it will give you
directions.

There will be more information posted later about the Full Moon Burritos.
