Hi Tim,
Depends!  Cc can be increased by either or a combination of stroke or bore 
enlargement.  Increasing the crank stroke increases torque which is very good 
for a bus especially for hill climbing, increasing bore of the P&Cs increases 
HP which is not as good for a bus.  Also increasing the bore of the P&Cs 
above 87mm really requires boring the openings in the heads and engine case 
open.  Doing this really weakens the engine case just forward the # 3 
cylinder and often it cracks there to pour oil on the FW and clutch.

Either find an old fashioned locksmith who can cut you new keys just off your 
ignition key code.  He might also have the pins to change in the door handle 
tumblers.  Or try Gabrile (-at-) GABVWKEY(-at-)cs.com  or  (209) 475-0868.
