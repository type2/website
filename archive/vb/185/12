Almost certain that is the correct one.  Looks exactly like the one in
my '62 (although the backrest seems a bit "flat").

Like others have said its the heater outlet, but don't forget that there
is a plate that is installed over the hole/tube across the "toe kick"
recessed area.  I guess it was so things wouldn't fall in to the heater
duct so easily.  I took a pic of the one in my '62
