what type of tranny fluid are you guys using? have you tried synthetic? I
have not used it yet, i am thinking of switching to synthetic-as I notice my
bus shifting is more difficult in colder weather-thought thta might help.

it may be a short term solution, until you figure out the problem, or can
afford a new tranny...

then again-i don't know a thing about trannys-so correct me if i am wrong...
