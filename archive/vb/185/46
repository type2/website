Subject: SC vs DC - hoops

Are SC & DC hoops the same?  I have a set of what were purported
to be SC hoops, which I never actually tried out on a bus.  It
turns out they're really 2 front bow, but gimme 20 minutes with
a welder and some scrap steel and it will become a rear.

The question, however, is with the front hoop; is there a SC/DC
difference?  When I tried to bolt up the front hoop, there's a 
'rib' that prevents the bottom holes from lining up.  The hoop
is parallel to the bus, so it doesn't look like a 'bent-up' 
sort of thing, it's just that the hole in the bed is about 1/2" 
too far forward.

Oh, and while playing with my truck last night, on a whim, I
added a little accessory:
