Subject: Quarterlight seals

I am restoring my window frames at my evening classes, have bead blasted the
frames, but I need to order some new seals for them.
The quarterlight seals that were fitted do not fit correctly, so the quarter
lights were always open by about 3/8".
I want to get some better seals, what are the WCM ones like?  If these
aren't to good, any other recommendations?
