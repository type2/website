Its quite difficult to actually find a rust free beam at a reasonable price
over here now though unfortunately - I managed to get one cheaply but when
it arrived it was for a pre 60 bus.  Another one I got had a hole in the
bottom and was full of crud.

This hole was only tiny, it had crud against it that I pulled off to reveal
a small hole.  I then poked around and removed all the rusty metal to reveal
a hole this size.  Inside it seems pretty good and there was no evidence of
further rust inside - there was no loose material inside either like the
other rusty beam I had.  I had a good poke round with a poker and I am
having it blasted so that should hopefully show that it is not rusty.  I
will have to keep an eye out on it though.
