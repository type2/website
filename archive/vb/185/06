Hi Dave,

  Empathetically, I made my heart drop too!  I think it would be great to
go to lakes and use it as a high dive, or to look over canyons, it is a
excellent spy mobile too!

  Since the front bumper mounts are part of the frame, and it looks like
it was pulled down, and it looks like it is <5 degree bend, it make sense
to use the weight being pulled up from the bumper mounts with the
stabilizers to bend it back.

  Look at it cafefully afterword, all cables and brake lines can pull
loose at either end.

Best,
joe
