Subject: Opps , My bad. Binz front bed area does have the  indents,

Ok good thing i didn't bet on the indents we were discussing  at  Raf's shop
friday nite. Also, Wade and Todd as well my Binz DOES have those indents at
the front bulkhead of the bed. We looked at Dan's friday and Todds, i woulda
bet mine didn't have them but i was wrong , after close inspection this
morning in less rain than the last time i looked,  i saw that it does have
the 2 side ones and the middle one as well. My bad.
I want to thank Kris, Mark, and all the Das Kool Bulli's for their
hospitality Friday as well as for putting on a great show again this year.
It was great to see old friends from our years of  VW'ing and also meet a
few more. Hopefully next year Punk and i can take a bit more time off and i
won't woose out on bringing the Binz like i did this time. Ok i'm outta
here, work time
