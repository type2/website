Subject: Transmission woes

Hello all,
   My 67 developed a whine coming from around the transmission about a
week ago.  The sound is there whenever the clutch is not depressed all
the way in.  I ordered a release bearing and installed it yesterday (the
engine pull was a lot easier than I thought it would be.) however, after
putting it all back together, the whine is still there.  I believe that
this sound is a bad bearing in the transmission.  I am wanting to drive
my bus to New Mexico in two weeks, and therefore do not have time to get
a rebuilt transmission shipped from Rancho (3-week delay).  Is there a
transmission place within driving distance of Stillwater, Oklahoma that
anyone on this list would trust.  I need to know soon, whatever help you
could give would be greatly appreciated.
