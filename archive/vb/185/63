......Yeah if you have 2 front hoops, you wouldn't have the bumpers, but
they are missing on  alot of rear hoops too-see Dropgates for pics of
bumpers, etc. The hoops will deflect sideways in a crosswind, & the bumpers
keep them in place by pressing against the side gates & not marring the
paint on the gate/hoop.


 I have the curved strap - do you not

DC's didn't use them, but you're right they wouldn't hurt.

 I don't see how it can hurt.

Any good hardwood lumber supplier should be able to sell you enough white
oak($30+-)to make the 6 slats-again see dropgates for details.  Also see
archives for mucho threads on these, etc.

All the SC/Dc's I have seen are the same, except for Binz's.  Still not sure
what rib you are referring to.

Hmmmm? not sure of any bed/hoop differences in later model buses, but a
client sent me an og 79 DC canvas & I threw it on my 63 DC & it fit perfect.
