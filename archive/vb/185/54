.......I believe they are the same except for the rear hoop has no slotted
bracket  about a foot up from the bottom to fasten it to the rear of the
cab, & also has rubber bumpers on each side to buffer the side gates from
the hoop. On SC tilts, there is also an intermediate curved strap that
supports the middle of the wood slats, unlike the DC slats.

 Not sure what you mean by rib-is it on the hoop or the truck? Pic?

The slotted bracket should be flush +- to the front of the truck bed. Have
you got the hoop turned around?
