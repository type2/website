I have done this in my bus and it's pretty easy. You
Just need to run a wire to the rear. I ran mine from
the brake sending switch on the master cylinder itself
after removing the wire that was the "out" (hot when
pressure applied) hot lead from the switch. I routed
it alongside the stock wiring harness to the rear of
the bus. No problem!
