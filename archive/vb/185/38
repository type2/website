unfortunatly i have been working 12+ hrs a day and havent had anytime to
myself, this has been the only weekend i took off and i slept the whole time.
there was a swap meet here a few weeks back in down town kc but i thought it
was sun and it was sat....other than that ive seen no vws on the streets and i
didnt even know the buskateers where located in kc..
