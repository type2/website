Subject: Re: [VB] wiper wiring

When pulling the wiper motor I pull it out from the dash with the wiring 
attached,  then remove the wiring.  Can't get it far with the wiring 
attached, but can get where I can see which wire goes where.    The short 
wiring loom goes to the wiper switch, and is held with a clip to the frame 
under the nos, you can just bend the tabs back to free the loom.   Other 
option is leave wires to motor  attached to wiper switch and remove switch 
with motor.

<< Hey There
     I pulled the wiper assembly out of our 66 bus, not too diificult. 
replaced
 the connecting rods, stems, and brass thingys,greased the motor Then putting
 it back in I realized I could not attach the wiring!?!? No room to work. I
 pulled the ashtray and could at least see the wiring and terminals. What's
