Yes the 53 or 52 and earlier hooks are different, they are a bit thinner
than the 54 to 58 ones. I have 2 of them I would be happy to sell for 100
each.

Damn, time to break out my box of extras.

Not strictly Barndoor either, I think they were used through 1958?
I think the pre-1953 hooks are different too.
