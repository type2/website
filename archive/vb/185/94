  Por 15 alternative.  While at the SEMA show (boring aftermarket and auto
parts EXPO) I talked to a guy who manufactures a POR 15 alternative. They
are sending me some samples to try and I will report on that soon. 30 to 40%
per cent less then POR 15 and has been tested and been around for a few
years (used mainly on big rig chassis). 
  Also on another note, Toyota is coming out with a new car (to compete in
the PT Crusier market) called the Scionion or something like that. The
reason I bring this up is it looks just like a Fridolen!!

i don't beleive you need to top-cout this stuff when applied under the body.
i called a local distributor about getting some to paint the underside of my
bus...he said i didn't need a topcoat.

currently i just have some surface rust under there, i thought i would paint
it with either the white or the grey por-15...that wya it would be easier to
see what is going on down there...i am thinking if i paint it witht he black
stuff-it will be harder to see under the bus...
