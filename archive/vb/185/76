Nick, sorry we haven't had anthing happening these past weeks since the swap
meet, but there are many good VW people in the KC area.  We have had a
couple panel rescues, one 58 and the other a 61 I believe.  Many projects
going on in the KC area too.

This is Buskatier turf and we will be having a house warming this Saturday
for one of the members, then camping in his front yard.  He wants the
neighbors to know what they're in for.

Tell you what, just so you know that in the KC area VW people are always
welcome, the MoKan VW club is having a party/meeting Wednesday at the
Machine Shed (it's a Midwest restaurant with great food), you are invited to
join us at 6:30.  We are a very friendly bunch and always welcome new
comers.  The Machine Shed is located in Olathe next to the Great Mall of the
Plains.  If you can make it, I'll buy you desert and they have some great
ones!!  Plenty of great VW talk and Bruce will be there who owns the Heb and
also a Schwimmer.
