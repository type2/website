Subject: wiper wiring

Hey There
    I pulled the wiper assembly out of our 66 bus, not too diificult. replaced
the connecting rods, stems, and brass thingys,greased the motor Then putting
it back in I realized I could not attach the wiring!?!? No room to work. I
pulled the ashtray and could at least see the wiring and terminals. What's the
secret Tiny robotics?
