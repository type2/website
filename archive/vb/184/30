Well basically they all got some kind of coating on them, never seen them
without it.
Could be Zinc, Cad or Galvanize but they last a long time in adverse
conditions.
I've got an 83 Westy and I've kept it exactly like it came from the
factory , Restored or replaced every moving part with NEW.............
I'll die and somebody will get it with $10,000.00 worth of restoration
parts for $2000.00 and drive off never knowing that they bought a new
car.
They'll be very confused when they blow the stock motor and buy another
Westy expecting it have the same dependability or performance they got
from mine.
Upside is I've run it 370,000 miles 
Its not a matter of copper vs steel its just that the OEM or Copies are
available and they aren't that expensive.
All this FuFu of powder coating and such is great if you're going to
restore a vehicle for SHOW conditions but the generic stuff is ok for the
rest of us.
We just want to get a fair number of miles for the bucks we spend.

83 Westfalia Air Cooled
66 Westy ? Something later engine and tranny.






 Why would anyone want thin unprotected bare steel tubing for  such an
important function? ( I powder coat mine:).
