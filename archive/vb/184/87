Is that the tool that looks like a bug jack?  Having dropped a couple of
bugs with that lousy "monkey climbing a tree" jack I wouldn't trust it to
hold a spring plate.  I just supported the bus on jack stands under the
torsion housing and used a cheapo floor jack to lift the end of the lever.
It didn't come close to lifting the bus off of the jack stands.
