Hmmm, they sure wasted a lot of time using those tools in the Bentleys
manual section H-10. Great pics of what I did too.

A split BUS(not a bug, which does have more preload and is dangerous) spring
plate does not have the preload. 20 degrees is less than an inch below the
lower stop, meaning in stock position the plate when pried off the lower
stop will swing down less than an inch, I have a hard time beliving there
would be much difference from bus to bus.  I used a prybar to pull it off
the stop(if you look in your bently you'll see the same thing, doubt they
would do that with a dangerous preload) and a jack to lift it up. I didn't
use a chain and I wasn't EXTRA careful, or lucky. There just wasn't any
danger. No more so than anytime you have a vehicle on jack stands.
