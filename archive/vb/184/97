Subject: Re:'BENTVW' ... sad story

Major, major bummer. To bend something back to
the original position entails overbending to
accommodate springback in the material. With
this case, the bed or the cab are in the way
and prevent simply (ha) bending the frame back.

Depending on the configuration of the beam on
the underside, you may have to do some local
bending on the beam itself, from the underside
to fix it. Older I beam trucks, such as my '64
Ford, get some of their alignment adjustments
by actually bending the I beam. Few shops have
the equipment let alone the expertise to do 
such 'old timers' work anymore.

I suggest finding a shop that can do this kind
of work. Try shops that specialize in springs,
large truck repair facilities, and check with
old alignment shops for leads and recommendations.

In Sacramento, I would go with no hesitation to
Sacramento Spring. They've been in business
since the horse and buggy days, working on the
springs for stagecoaches.

If bending can't work, a really good and experienced
welder can come in handy. With proper welding and
cooling, they can make metal move in mysterious
ways. THIS IS NOT FOR AMATEURS. I emphasize this,
as unless you have years of experience in using
welding and heating to MOVE metal, not just weld
it, you can do some serious damage. Check around
at the older auto or truck restoration shops to
find this expertise. Welding/cooling can move metal
into position without overbending.

Good luck . . .

and was suitably impressed with their work on
rocket engines

--------------- David:
Now, there is a one inch gap between the
top of the bed and the cab with no gap at 
the bottom!!!!!!!!!!   

So, the 64 dollar question is how to fix it.  
I'll go and get a few pictures of it later today.
