Subject: Zelenda Tool Book...

Hi Ronnie,

I believe I probably have the same Zelenda Tool book (like Ronnie, also not
for sale), which I got in a bulk purchase of ex-VW dealership manuals many
years ago.  Mine is contained in a mostly light blue three ring binder which
is dated 1973 in the upper right hand corner.  The binder cover has the
following silk-screened on the cover:  the title "Zelenda Tools for
Volkswagen, Porsche & Audi", a photo of four various tools, one of which is
the rare and illusive VW#261, and a small illustration along the bottom of the
binder cover of a white pre-'68 Beetle and a red VW 411. The catalog inside
shows the photos of each tool and their applications as you mentioned in your
post a while back.  Unfortunately my book didn't come with the added letters
to the VW dealership dictating the required minimum tools for a dealership,
which would be cool to see.  This book has been instrumental in figuring out
the various VW special tools that I've bought over the years, their VW tool
#'s and their applications.  No one tool book seems to have all the special
tools ever made listed, so each of us tool collectors out there are probably
missing some data.  Too bad all of us with these books couldn't get together
sometime with some adult beverages and go page by page through our books to
see who is missing what and fill in all the blanks.  If that "VW special
tool/fetish" party ever gets scheduled, I'll be there.  While waiting, if you
ever want to compare notes, book to book, tool by tool, just let me know...
