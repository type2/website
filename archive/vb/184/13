With a 34PICT-3 and SVDA distributor, no flat spots, ever ! I keep the
.009/.050 for the dune buggy or trike.

Question for those of you who run a Dual Suck distributor on their 1600 bus:

I read somewhere that it makes timing much easier and consistent if you
simply
block off the retard port on the flat side of the vacuum can and just hookup
up the advance port as usual on the left side of the carb (34pict3). Anyone
have any ideas or opinions about doing this!
