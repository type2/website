Subject: Re: [VB] SOUND DAMPNER?

If you say silencers I think you are english and talking about the muffler.   
The bits between the heater box and the body I called the flexy metal heat 
tube and the sound damper pod.
pods do work, but I still hear some engine noise through my 65 westy, which 
has high power air flow- really!

If your fan belt breaks and whacks a fresh air tube, and you crumple it up to 
keep the air from blowing out that side till you can get to a new fresh air 
tube, the heater box on that side gets really, really REALLY hot, and melts 
the plastic heater duct tube if you have that kind heater box to bus.  For 
that reason I"ll not use that kind again.  Really reeked.  Man, I hate 
melting plastic.

<< The silencers are what goes between the heater box and the duct to the
 front. On split buses it comprises of a flexible metal pipe and a oblong
 metal silencer(looks like a little muffler). The silencer is kinda like a
 glass pack muffler. A straight thru center w/ the packing around it. The
 packing is held in by what looks like 1/4"chicken wire screen as it forms
 the tube that the air flows through. >>
