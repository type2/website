Hi Eric,
The problem with that proceedure is that then the timing at idle can be 
anywhere, including 28-30 degrees like Eric's sister's 1969 bus which had a 
frozen advance system.  If timed only as you recommend this would really have 
the engine running hot at idle and including probable detonating from being 
too advanced at low RPMs.  Also if memory serves correctly VW stated as long 
as any distributor reached 20 BTDC (-at-) 2,500 RPM it was acceptable to the VW.
