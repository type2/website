'GRAFVW'  (giraffe VW, also sounds like an airship name)
'RBNKVW'  (rubberneck VW?)
'VWLGNK'  (VW longneck)
'VWCRAN'  (VW crane)
'HOKUVW'  (ho:he kubel (high bucket) VW)
'UPPRVW'  (upper VW)

I agree that the TALLVW, HIGHVW ones sound like plates for a high-roof.

Suggestion: Start learning German.  There are probably more of these
trucks still in Germany than in the USA.  So, you'll have to ask the
Germans when you're trying to figure out if all the hardware on the
bucket assembly is *correct* or not.  :)
