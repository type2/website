Hi Volksvan,
We used that when we could not find any better, but not much differance 
between that and gluing in sections of garden hose.  Then we found Bus Depot 
had a sealed foam rubber type of one piece engine lid/ SC side door seal.  
The four piece you have is a rotten product especially because the monoxide 
and the hot engine cooling air behind the bus can easily be sucked into the 
engine compartment.
