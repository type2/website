Subject: Recovering....& Just Putting Along

Just to think, it all started with an angiogram at Ventura Community
Memorial to check up on my latest condition.  Wasn't in that room for more
than 15 minutes when they wheeled right back out and said "Thompson, we
gotta problem here".  Well, if it's gotta be done, let's get the show on
the road and see what happens.  Hmmmmm, 4-way bypass, ok let's hunker down
here then.  Coulda been worse - coulda been pushin' up daisies.

Well, 10 ten days of hospital food, procedures, IV's out the wazoo and
midnight blood pressure checks amongst a hundred other things are behind me
now.  I appreciate Unca Jerry spreading the word to all of you fine "volks"
out there.  A lot (!) of you jammed the mailbox and all who did are
appreciated for their "get well soon" posts.	

A note of appreciation goes out to my best bud Cliff in North Hollywood,
CA. who called practically everyone we both knew (many who still haven't
come into the cyberspace age yet) to let people know what was going on as
well.

I'm a little slow and sore right now, but I'll bounce back soon enough.
I'm snug as a bug (or bus or vanagon) in my 84 Westy while it's raining
like mad outside here in Ventura, CA just looking forward to another day of
stayin' alive - I've got enough pills here to choke a horse!  And it's sure
nice to have taken off about 20 pounds - the effort's gonna be keeping it
off too.

Now back to the Bosch Microfiche transcribings/translations and answering
informational inquiries.

Y'alls have a good VW day now :-)
