Watched a spy movie on TV Thursday night called "The Double Man", starring Yul Brinner.  

The majority of the movie was filmed in the Swiss and Austrian Alps during the winter, and the good guys spend lots of time motoring about in the snow in a gorgeous 23-window deluxe.  

Lots of close-up and interior footage, plus plenty of shots from various distances and angles while it's being driven in both day and night scenes.  Even the engine sounds seem to be right... 

The movie was released in 1967, and the splitty looks brand new, so it's probably a '66 or very early '67.
