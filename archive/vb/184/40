yes i saw the movie in the middle of the night also
and it has bullet turn signals i thought it was a 62
but it could be 63 also.
great shots lots of times of the bus. nice to see in a
movie rather than just a quick pan going by on the
street or a retro bus but then i suppose if we watched
movieds from the 60's more then we'd see more ;-)
