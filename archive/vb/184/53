You could but with alot of trouble loosening the generator tin from the 
shroud.  We used a 4 in 1 screw driver, by removing one of the double ended 
apex ends.  Then with a 8mm open ended wrench to turn the apex remove the 
lower brush screw and then pull out the old brush and install new brush.  
Finishing up with replacing the connection screw.  Total time is about ten or 
less minutes.  Best to be working over a paved surface so if the connection 
screw drops out you can find it or at least put down some rag or paper under 
the generator to catch this.
