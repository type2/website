Subject: RE: [VB] vw shops

sorry i guess i was referring to shops that sell parts...i have heard of
these vw guys who are supposed to be pretty good.

but i would love to be able to go in a vw shop that just sells vw stuff...so
i don't have to mail order an exhaust system, and wait a few days for it.
there are a lot of "basic" vw parts that you can't walk in anywhere and get
around here...
