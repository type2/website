Subject: Reflections  a bus owner

Hello List,
Since it is Friday I thought I would share a story with you.  Twenty three 
years ago I kissed my wife goodby and started off to teach middle school.  I 
was driving a 1966 VW bus back and forth.  The bus had a burned out starter 
and I couldn't afford another one so I just parked it on a hill at home and 
in the top of the parking lot at school so I could coast it off.  The heater 
boxes were shot and it  had a lot of dings and dents. My hair was kind of 
long, my beard was shaggy and I dressed funny. Needless to say I got a lot 
of strange looks and comments from parents and students.
Fast forward 23 years:
  This morning I kissed my wife(same one) goodby and started off to teach 
middle school(same one).I am still driving a VW bus (different one) to 
school. The bus has a burned out starter and I don't feel like changing it 
so I just park it on a hill at home and in the top of the parking lot at 
school so I can coast it off.  The heater boxes are shot and it has a lot of 
dings and dents. My hair is kind of long and much less plentiful, my beard 
is gray and I dress funny. Needless to say I get a lot of strange looks and 
comments from parents, some used to be my students.

The ride to school was still fun this morning. I still love my wife. I still 
love my bus. I still enjoy teaching middle school. I'm not getting a 
haircut.  The parent's comments still give me a kick.  Life is good. I 
really do need to change that starter though.
Boyd Smith
