Hi Eric,
We keep our cruising RPM to 3,000 which has doubled engine life and greatly 
increased MPG in our VWs.  In outside temps over 90F we have found it 
necessary to drop to about 2,800 RPM to keep the oil temp below 220F.

Same here!  Our 1641SP DR engine with type 4 cooler, 35mm wide cooling fan, 
cleaned & drilled head fins, Large DP lower puller with 356 generator pulley 
for 2.75:1 ratio instead of the 1.8:1 DP ratio.  Plus 3.875 R&P with .82 
fourth gear and 1964-67 RGBs freeway flier for about 59MPH cruising all day.
