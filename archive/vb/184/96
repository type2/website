The 28-30* advance by 3K is what I've heard generally across the board for 
009.   

When you set your timing at 5*, was that 5 BTDC, or 5 ATDC?   When the timing 
advances, like when you rev the engine, the timing mark will moving 
counterclockwise on the crank pulley.    If you are looking at the top half, 
the mark moves to the left.  If you set the timing at 9 BTDC, the TDC mark 
will be to the left of the seam in the engine case.   I make a mark for TDC 
and a timing marks on my crank pulley.  Not a bad Idea to remove a spark plug 
and check TDC mark on the pulley  by seeing when a screwdriver stuck down the 
cylinder is at extreme.

 the timing at 5 degrees at idle but some years in the dummy book show
 7.5 degrees advance. I guess my question is while everyone is on this
 subject is  when at 3000-3500rpm you should be at 28-30 advance or is >>
