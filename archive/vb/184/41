That puzzled me, too.  It definitely had the rear corner windows, because I made a point of checking that in several shots.

Perhaps it wasn't a '66 or '67, but especially in the early part of the film the rig looked so new you could almost smell the upholstery.

I doubt an internet search for the movie would turn up details of the vehicles [there were also some very nice Mercedes-Benz 300 saloons].  I'll just have to watch it again when I can - not a problem as it's a good movie :-)
