Stan's post didn't include the reason:)

Why would anyone want thin unprotected bare steel tubing for
such an important function? ( I powdercoat mine:).

I haven't seen copper-plated steel lines,but it sounds like a reasonable
alternative. The oem Porsche brake lines are painted and coated
with some sort of clear plastic. Galvanized would be good too.

News Flash ! Bare steel will rust !
