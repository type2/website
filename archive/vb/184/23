Subject: Re: [VB] re:copper or steel brake lines

The bearer of bad news is here ............. brake lines are steel for a
reason.
#1) They are 1/8" , 3/16" whatever. But they are actually rolled from a
band of steel that is .010 and 2" or more wide, in other words they are
many layers wrapped. 
I've seen recent lines that are single ply seem welded, they tend to
split when you bend them.
#2) They have a double flare on the ends.
Brake lines last a long time ....  try to get the right parts.
The Sorry Britts put the brake lines under the battery on my MG Midget
and nearly killed me.
But I didn't have a wreck or die so I just thank common sense that I
mover the lines over the battery when I replaced them. 
Damn thing still wouldn't stop worth a crap. 
My reason for selling it after 12 years. 
Drive it slow or leave it at home.

for copper lines-they must have been referring to copper lined, as copper
does not rust, but the base or core is probably steel.
