California defines it as 25.  YMMV.

Note, however, that in order to be a slow-moving vehicle emblem, it has to
have an orange center and red borders.  Certain groups that don't want the
flashy colors (such as some Amish) use reflective tape in shades of grey.

You could make a very effective sign in other colors (such as
high-visibility yellow/green) and be just as conspicuous as the official
sign and still not violate the law.

Personally, I think that a wide sheet of white reflective material applied
to the bumpers would be even more effective.
