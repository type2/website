I would think that if it was stock on Buses, it would show up on the
Euro wiring diagram.  Perhaps Buses counted as "trucks" and came under
different regulations.

This is standard equipment on new cars in Germany.  The German word for
it is something long, like 'Hinterschneeregennebelscheinwerfer' (rear
snow, rain, fog light).  Some cars have unique tail light clusters for
it; others have just a right backup light and put the rear fog light in
the left backup light spot.  At the bottom of this page, there's a photo
of a US-spec Camaro that was imported to Germany by the owner - he had
to add these lights to it:

I've ridden in the fog in Germany and these lights really do help.  Brake
lights are visible through the fog, but tail lights are hard to see.  The
rear fog light helps you keep your distance from the next car.  However,
you are supposed to switch it off as soon as the fog clears up - you'll
get lots of honking and headlight-flashing from other cars if you don't.
