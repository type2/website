When Missouri made insurance mandatory in the early 90s, you could either
show them the proof-of-insurance card from your agent, OR you could post
a bond ($10,000, secured, I think) with the state.  This might be another
option.

What I'm waiting for is, "Sir, your DNA says that you're 25% more likely
than average to get cancer, so your health insurance premium will be
$1,000 a month."

Bus content: Insurance on my Bus is only about $100 every 6 months, but
that's just state-mandated minimums, no comprehensive.  Never had to
file a claim for the Bus.
