Subject: Drivers seat padding

My 66 bus has the 2/3rds bench and 1/3 drivers seat.  The seats have had
Sewfine covers in the past (from a receipt and looking at the colour charts)

However my drivers seat is quite uncomfortable and I get back aches when
driving any distance.  Today I sat in a friends bus and his seat is much more
comfortable - it seems to sink more at the back of the base than mine.
I guess mine still has the original padding - anyone got any suggestions as to
how to make my seat more comfortable???

And how do I remove the covers - is this a job for an upholsteror?

Thanks
Paul
