Even the B/W triangle is retroreflective, just not in the orange color.

Many of the Amish that object to the use of the triangle instead outline
the rear of their buggies with grey reflective tape.  That way it becomes
part of the buggy, rather than being an "ornament" or "symbol."

Putting that in VW terms, one could put a large sheet of retroreflective
white material on the rear bumper without altering the appearance of
the bus.
