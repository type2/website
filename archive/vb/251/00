You can hot-wire it to get the engine running, but you still have to
deal with the steering lock - if you don't, you can only drive straight
forwards or backwards.  http://www.type2.com/library/electrip/igbay.htm
is a good description of how the lock comes apart and implies you should
be able to do it with most everything still installed on the Bus.
http://www.specialpatrolgroup.co.uk/spooky/barrel/barrel.html is another
write-up on the same topic but is based on taking the whole assembly out
of the Bus first.

Probably the simplest thing to do would be to remove the lock cylinder
and electrical part (you'll need a tiny Allen wrench), and then take off
the steering lock altogether.  You can leave the electrical part of the
switch out of the column and just turn it with a screwdriver to operate.
Once you get a lock cylinder and matching key, put it all back together.

You might also want to bring an adjustable wrench (or your wrench that
fits the generator pulley nut), a spark plug socket, an oil can with
spout, a gallon or two of fresh gas, and maybe some fuel hose and clamps.
Poke at the fuel lines to make sure they aren't real bad - if they are,
replace them.  Before you try to crank it with the starter, take the
plugs out, squirt a little oil into the cylinders, put the plugs back,
and use the wrench to turn the engine over.  This makes sure it's not
stuck and lets you listen for any obvious problems.  You should be able
to feel the compression build up and release as you turn it.  When you're
happy with that, dump most of the gas you brought into the tank.  Take
off the air cleaner connection and dribble a little fresh gas right down
the carb throat, then put the air cleaner connection back on.  Face
Hannover, cross your fingers, and try the starter...
