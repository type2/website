Subject: Re: [VB] Well,  the Amish must a . . .

Many of the Amish that object to the use of the triangle instead outline
the rear of their buggies with grey reflective tape.  That way it becomes
part of the buggy, rather than being an "ornament" or "symbol."

I've been through Amish country many times and even over their
objections, many carry a car battery to power the headlights and tail
lights that the DPS requires for traveling in sundown to sun up hours.
It's not just the cute little surry routine, these folks routinely have
very large horse drawn cargo wagons on the State Highways and Farm to
Market roads.
On the few occasions that I have bought produce and fresh fruits and home
canned items from them I've found it very difficult to get much more
conversation from them than a courteous "Thank you sir".
I'd be curious to know if the Amish would admonish God for having heaven
paved with streets of Gold.
