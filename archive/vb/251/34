Subject: Friday - Echo! Echo! The old deadbeat on the bus routine once

In keeping with my hard headed policy I have once again refused to drop
the price of my 66 Splittie Westfalia to the lower than acceptable price
that another deadbeat has offered me.
This time I didn't take the guy to the Bus Station, Airport or local bus
stop.
This time I just left him standing there at the curb in front of my house
with his pitiful few Splittie buying dollars burning a hole in his
pocket.
Mom and I went on to her doctors appointment.
He was gone by the hour or so when we returned.
Warning Guys! This Splittie Loves me ............... no matter who buys
it, You can expect it to return home to me.
It will require a stout chain or superior US made wire rope restraints to
limit its leaving to return to me.
I'm feeling a lot like a character in a Steven King book.
I'm just about to get on-line and contact Dione Warwick and get this hex
removed for well and good.
As a second option I'm going to advertise it real cheap and go up on the
price when the gullible buyer gets here ................. 
I'm feeling that I need to get revenge on these deadbeats; is that
normal? 
Or, Am I as crazy as everybody says?.
Got to go now I'm having a hard time typing with this turnip wagon
bouncing me all around ......... I could fall off.
