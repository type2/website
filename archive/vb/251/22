 I finally get a CD player that I can plug into it,
----------------- Clip -----------------------
I never found a five disk magazine that I could hide properly and as
rough as my vans ride a low end player would skip a lot. I've got a jack
to plug a portable CD player into on my radio face but the player just
skipped too much to make it practical.
Back to the old school ............... I just bought CDs and recorded
them onto tapes and kept my $400 in my pocket.
Oh! By the way, my front doors don't lock.
