Subject: Shifting problems update

A while ago I asked a few questions when I had problems with the box I had
fitted in my camper that had been sitting for some time.

I purchased a new shifter as my old one was particularly worn, and have now
completed 500 miles and it is shifting a lot better now.

Thanks for the advice.

This week I shall change the gearbox oil and add slick 50 to the new oil.
Also I will remove the engine to retorque as several people have recommended.

Thanks a lot
Paul
