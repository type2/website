That radio will not fit a split.If fitting to a 67 you will need the Europa
TR DIN mounting kit for it,this is sized to fit the smaller opening on a
bus.For the 66 and earlier vehicles you need the shaft mount Europa TR face
plate.It is still a little small for the opening but if you have a bus radio
surround you can file it to fit the Becker radio and all is good.I will post
pictures of my TR installed in the 59.

Another good thing on the Becker radios that used an outboard amp is the
abality to use any amp,so you can have a vintage head unit and big power.The
cassette players are nice and just plug into the rear of the head unit,you
can also hijack the line level inputs and run the line in of a portable
whatever you want to the head unit and control the volume off the head unit.
