Hi all,

I'm marching out the door for the airport to fly to Brussels for the BBT shop
and the upcoming Bad Camberg VW show and festivities.  I hope to see some of
you there, and I'll post a summary of the adventure once I return.  Take care
and we'll see you soon!  If you're over in Europe and see a Navy Blue colored
'49 Standard Beetle fly by, be sure to wave!

Wooooo Hoooo!!!
