Hi Matt,
That would be us!  We bolted on two small round trailer lights on the license 
plate holed on the rear of our bus.  These are wired to each of the USA 
brake/turn signal taillights so they work like the normal taillights.  Also we ONLY 
use yellow vintage glass lenses in these.  They do not haze up like cheapy 
plastic lenses used in these and most importantly they are very visable even 
during the day.  Plus act as secondary signals if one or both of the tailights 
fail.  
  One of the few times we have been pulled over was in Arizona when it was 
getting dusk, the freeway speed limit was 70 MPH and the natives did 90+ MPH.  
The Arizona State Trooper was very friendly and asked us not to drive after 
dark because of our cruising speed of 53 MPH at that time and the stock running 
lights.  We told him we were just looking for a place to pull off and camp for 
the night, and thanked him for his concern.
  Eric's sister installed cheapie yellow rectangle fog lights as signals on 
her rear bumper on her 1969 Canadian camper conversion panel bus.  They have 
worked great and no law enforcement types have bothered her about them.
  It would be an easy thing to also rig up some yellow running lights for 
better visablity.
