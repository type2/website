Most car radios I've played with don't pick up anything without an
antenna.  However, antennas are easy to make.  Get some 14 gauge or
so wire, strip the end about an inch, fold it over to double the
thickness, and stick it down in the center hole of the antenna socket.
Experiment with the gauge and the bend to make it fit snugly.  Make
sure that the bare end only touches the center hole; if you short the
center hole to the outside, you won't hurt anything but you won't pick
up anything either.

To pick up your Ipod, you probably only need 6" (15 cm) of wire.  If
you're trying to pick up local radio stations, 3' (90 cm) or so is
better.  (If you want to get really technical, use 85.2 cm for 88 MHz,
all the way down to 69.4 cm for 108 MHz.  For AM you have to do
something different, as the antenna for 540 KHz would be 139 meters
long...)  The $30 Wal-Mart radio in my Bus right now has an antenna
like this - it comes out of the slots in the dash and loops around
the rearview mirror for support.  I just haven't bought an antenna
yet to match the holes a PO put in the front skin.
