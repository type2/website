Hi Volks,
Cool!  Those were sold by VWOA!  There is a photo of them in our 1966 VW 
accessory manual, and there is a matching side step.  We have a pair of those and 
side step for one of our SCs.  Can someone get us measurements of the angle 
iron that the rear bumper attaches to the body with?  
Thanks,
Eric&Barb
