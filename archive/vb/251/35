I've got a jack
to plug a portable CD player into on my radio face but the player just
skipped too much to make it practical.

not sure what type of portable you were trying, but i was using one with a
40 second memory, that I used to plug into cheap little battery powered
speakers...cd player was less than $100 and the speakers were less than $40.
and because they were portable it was real easy to take them out whenever
the party moved out of the bus...and because they had there own batteries, I
never worried about drainging the bus of juice.
