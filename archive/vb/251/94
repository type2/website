I agree with the disagree...  I've been driving up and down the I-5 for
30 years, at all hours; I never give it a second thought. I do 62 mph in
the right lane, occasionally passing slower traffic, and this doesn't
count the dozens of times I 've driven from CA to NY over the years. Maybe
I've been lucky, who knows.
