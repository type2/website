Hey all,

Had to chime in on the music deal since I just need it when I drive my camper.  
Currently I just have the radio action workin' for me, but when I finally get a CD player 
that I can plug into it, here's what I'll be listening to.

> Neil Finn
> Midnight Oil
> Techscaper (thegammakbass.com)
> Pacifier
> Bob/Ziggy Marley
> Whole Bunches of Mixed Stuff off the net....
> Old Classic Rock stuff (CCR, Doors, etc.)
> Crowded House

-Taylor (in need of a discman)
