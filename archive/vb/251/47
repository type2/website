Yes, i second the iPod idea. Carry hours of skip-free music in your  
shirt pocket. It won't be stolen unless you get held up while walking  
to the bus. Downside is you need a computer (mac or pc) to encode the  
mp3's (compressed digital music format). Upside is you get to build  
your own playlists.
And yes, we too are looking for an old sapphire or equivalent...
Here is a link to an online auction of a radio (and cassette) which  
might look good in a bus, even though it has chrome, not ivory knobs:

Bus content: What is the best place to mount speakers on a bus so that  
the driver has good sound? The old (t)rusty '62 single cab we used to  
drive on Maui had a couple of 6x9's behind the seat and it sounded nice!
I still have the og '61 speaker mounted in the dash, but when we hooked  
up a test radio it sounded loud albeit a bit raggedy, I think the paper  
cone is torn.
