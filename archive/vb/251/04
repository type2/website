Subject: Re:  bryce - No its BICE, rear bumper

Just to be technical, its Bice, not Bryce. Keep seeing people calling it "bryce" other places on the
internet for some reason. I Guess "Bice" just sounds too weird to be real.
Anyway, you missed out, a guy put an add on my site for a set for super cheap. He ended up scrapping
them! So serial number 359 is no more. Nobody wants to pay for shipping- talk about heavy! I emailed
him back when he cancelled the add and he gave me the addy of some scrap yard back east if i wanted
to call them and try to save them! I was mad cause he never let me know that they were going to the
crusher if nobody wanted them for free.  I woulda taken them. I still wonder if they will be
desirable someday. I guess those rare ugly hurst bumpers are desireable,*flame suit on*, so why
shouldnt rare ugly Bice bumpers be desireable also right? Most people think Bice are supah ugly.
Your the first person i have ever seen actually 'looking' for some.

A guy i know sold a truck that had those on, on my site, but it was only a front. Ill see if he can
ask the new owner if he wants to get rid of them, chances are good he does im sure.. which style are
you looking for? Ive seen 5 or so different styles and im sure theres more.
