FWIW, I put a $130-260 W. Blaupunkt CD/stereo radio w/ removable face plate
in the parcel tray of my DC. Dosen't skip even w/ stiff shocks(KYB gas
adjusts) unless you  go over something really big, sounds great w/ the 6x9
Bose speakers w/ labels removed, never been stolen, but I have lost the face
plate- fried the unit the first time I tried to install it, & took it back
to Costco 6 months later w/o receipt, & they gave me a new one! Beat that!

Tom Buese-63 DC w/ CD player no one will steal(Ihope)
