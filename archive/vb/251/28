Subject: Re: [VB] Split Bus Sway Bars (Front and Rear)

In the '70s I ran a somewhat hot '64 bug with front and rear sway bars.  
They were 3/4 inch.  I ran the bug on the cheapest bias ply tires.  The 
handling was just beyond belief.  The sway bars prevented most 
suspension travel and the car cornered like a go cart.  The cheap narrow 
tires would break free and lose grip before you could get into too much 
trouble.  It felt a lot like driving an old mini.  I put some 70 series 
radial tires on and the fun disappeared.  The extra grip that the better 
tires provided revealed the dynamic handling problems bug have.  The 
oversteer and tendency the spin/roll when poorly driven.  I removed the 
rear sway bar and the car felt much safer though a lot less fun to 
drive.  I've only driven with camber compensators on buses, not rear 
sway bars and I do not know how they would effect handling.  Camber 
compensators do help on smooth roads!  Gary Gibson
