on further study today, what i REALLY want to do is forego the radio 
at all; instead, i am on the hunt for some powered 12v computer 
speakers! if i can swozzle them in to a cigarette lighter jack, and 
plug them into the ipod headphone output, viola. all the potential 
thief will see are some fugly computer speakers and a jack sitting on 
the dash. the ipod will travel w/ me.


matt, i don't suppose that massive brain of yours knows the milliamp 
output of a vw ciggy jack?  :)
