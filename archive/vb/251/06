 Technically, no.  Buses are too fast to be considered a "slow moving

 OTOH, you can make a "slow moving vehicle" triangle in any other color and
 be perfectly legal.

Do you know how fast (or slow) you have to drive to be considered a slow 
moving vehicle?    does 50mph qualify?   or does it have to be 45mph or less?  I 
thought it was illegal to drive slower than 45mph on the freeway.
