I looked at doing this when the original bulb holder came out of the
bucket on my right tail light.  The FLAPS sells various sockets that
either twist-lock into a matching plastic reflector or have spring clips
for a 3/4" or so round hole.  Some electronics places sell sockets that
have mounting tabs on them and might be easier to work with.  Rat Shock,
Mouser ( http://www.mouser.com/catalog/614/87.pdf , lower left corner),
and All ( http://www.allelectronics.com/cgi-bin/category.cgi?category=320400 )
sell some for the small bayonet-base bulbs; All occasionally has some
for the stock large bayonet-base bulbs.

I ended up getting a repop assembly, but I've still got the damaged
original bucket.  Some day I'll get a socket back on it.
