I have used the foam pads from TMI & the "horsehair" og style pads from
Wolfsburg. The foam ones are comfy , less expensive, but not as og looking
as the hair pads. The hair pads are firmer to start out w/look much better,
& are easier to install the covers over than the foam, which is why I prefer
them.

IMHO.
