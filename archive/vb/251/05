Funny how these things come in waves...............
Koch was selling 2-3 fronts at the last Pomona. I know the Jess's 
(Aridzona) got 1 or 2 and another guy got 1.
I'm trying to get the front outta tyhe 2nd guy for my "Industrial Panel" 
but he's up into the $$$ range, which sucks cause I could've bought them 
from Koch for $10-$15 if I would have been there.
