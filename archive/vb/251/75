Hi Ronnie,
Depends!  Does the filter end up on the right or the left!  Right will work 
with almost all stock mufflers.  Left will not work except for the ones Eric A. 
is selling, unless you cut an angle out of the neck between the filter and 
the cover, weld back together so the filter is just a bit lower than the left 
heat riser pipe coming out of the front of the stock muffler, and redrill back 
out the oil passages.
