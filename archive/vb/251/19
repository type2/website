Subject: Split Bus Sway Bars (Front and Rear)

Hi everyone,

We just finished unloading a crate full of swaybars yesterday. Just in case
anyone didn't know, we offer swaybars for the splitty bus:

and

Front bar is 20mm, and a rear is 18mm. They include all hardware to mount them
and install with basic tools. These are not generic sway bars, but
specifically made for this application. Fight the cross winds!
