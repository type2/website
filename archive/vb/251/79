I used box speakers (Radio shack aluminum box variety) on top of the
parcel shelf.  Reasonably good sound, easy installation, and no holes to
drill at all!  I've removed the stereo and will soon install my Icom
706 control head in the stock radio position with a standard top firing
speaker in the dash.  I'll have the world's most expensive mono radio!
