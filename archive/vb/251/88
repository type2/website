Is there a good way to move the partition back on a bus to gain more leg
room? I am 6'4" and have a 60 non walk-thru bench seat bus, but the
partition has been hacked ( not by me! : ) I could use some more leg
space up front, head room too but that's a different topic. Would there
be a good way to install a donor partition a few inches back and still
structurally fortify that area? or maybe some kinda rail just to hang the
seat back on. just wondering... 

Thanks
