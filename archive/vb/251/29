Subject: rear seat belt mounts

Surprised to find many studs with many empty holes and nuts rusted to the studs under the rear seat of my new '65 the other day.

Put a socket on the nuts and spun the studs.

Whats the mounting like underneath? Just a double nut and washer type thing through the structure?

Under the bus for the first time this weekend,
