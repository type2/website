Hello Guys   there are a number of ways to do this. on splits and bugs the 
simplest way is the oil pump with the full flow filter made to it.Will not work 
on a bay cause of the  motor suport bar. There are no hoses  on this style. 
Theother style has a plate with the outlet made on it and you have to block off 
the outlet on the pump housing and tap the block for the inlet to the engine. 
This is the type used most often on bays. Later and have fun Mark Dearing
