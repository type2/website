http://www.type2guy.com/59/59extra2.html and scroll down the page a 
little. Audiophiles might "poo-poo" the idea of box speakers....but 
in reality they do very well in a bus in the location. There's an 
illusion that you'd hit your knees on them...in reality they don't 
even come close to getting in the way. The sound is right there and 
rocks when you want it too. Spend a little more cash on 'em if you 
want better sound. But to me this is the best way to go.
