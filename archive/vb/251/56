OH MAN!!!!!!! have you SEEN this? ya gotta plug the url 
http://www.heise.de/ct/Redaktion/cm/Thumpmobile_Zapper.html

into altavista's babelfish  http://babelfish.altavista.com/

and translate the page.

beSIDES being a hilarious way to detonate stupid thumpomatic jeeps 
and riceburners, the half-assed translation is a hoot!

plus the phrase
>If the victim scharrt afterwards in the sand and shits into the 
>yard, the adjustment was wrong or the dose too high.


has to be worked into a conversation as soon as possible.

thanks to matt for the original link...
