Hi Volks,
Forgot to mention that last year we did get pulled over for having our right 
taillight out in Oregon by thier State Patrol.  It would have been a $100.00+ 
ticket, but they let us wiggle the bulb to clean the corrosion and let us off 
with a warning.  We have been wanting to add a second tailight bulb to each 
stock taillight reflector (As Bob Hoover suggested.) to double the light output 
and again act as a secondary bulb to help prevent a completely dark 
tailight/non functioning signal.  So far we have not found an easy and quality bulb 
holder to weld or bolt in place though.
