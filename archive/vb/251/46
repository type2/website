Subject: SO-42 cabinet lid needed 

Hi.
I'm passing this along for someone who found a part
for me. 

He's looking for the LID (door?) for the jump seat
cabinet on a 67 Westfalia. So, if you have one, and
(hopefully) you're not opposed to sending a part (at
least it's not a whole bus) to Japan. Email HIM
(address below).
