Subject: re:driver's seat padding

I would check the receipts and see if it indicates pads were sold, or you
could look at the base of the seat(do you see a lot of brown hair looking
substance?)

There are two ways I know of doing the padding-there are reproductions of
the original coir(horsehair looking stuff) which supposedly look better, but
are not as comfortable, nor last as long as the foam pads.

It is probably possible to take the covers off and reuse them. slide the
seat out, flip it over, and look at how it is attached. the originals were
attached via little spikes that were welded to the seat tubing, then pierced
the fabric, and bent over. These can be re-used by bending open carefully,
and re-crimping. This is how I did mine.

There is also the hog-ring method, of which I have no experience, but I
think you need to use these, if the original sharp wedges are broken off.
