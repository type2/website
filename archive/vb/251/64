i dunno - i routinely see harmon kardon computer speakers for $20 a 
pair, surplus.

wow.
  matt, how much to come over and rewire my bus with me? i want to 
redo the gauges and accessories :)
seriously, i see a career in bus electrics upgrade for you - charge 
people to tell you want they want, design the circuitry and send em 
instructions. fly out for the $$$ ones :)

cool - i wasn't sure how that worked; if i see, say, 600mA on the 
wall wart, i was worried the cig jack might pump out more and make 
toast.

i'm actually seeking to avoid the radio route; besides nothing worth 
listening to (f*ck you, clear channel), i had one burst into flames 
on me in heavy traffic once. i bet it looked hilarious... old bus 
tooling down the road, and a smoking radio is abruptly tossed out the 
passenger window.....
