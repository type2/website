no, unfortunately.   That's why I have the dumb header on my 65.  VeeWee111 
(Eric & Barb) use the kind that the filter goes on the other side (vintage 
performance stuff)  and even cut and welded one on the left(I think) so to use the 
stock muffler.  Might have that mixed up, but they didn't compromise like I 
did and go to the dark side and use a header.

but I just got a message from Eric about a stock muffler.  I couldn't find 
that specified on the website though.  more info?:

<<We carry a stock muffler here at Aircooled.Net that  puts the preheat pipe
on the opposite side so you can run a filter pump and still clear
everything.
