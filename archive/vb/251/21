I remeber that in Wisconsin or Iowa a few years ago,
some Amish went to court to try to be allowed to use
black and white SMV signs instead of orange as they
felt orange ones were too flashy for their relegion. 
I don't recall what the outcome was.
 
Clara (I think) asked:

It is 25 mph or less, and technically they aren't
legal on anything going any faster than that.  I know
that some freeways have minimum speeds of 40 or 45mph
posted.  So a SMV sign on any vehicle on the
interstate could be an excuse for authorities to pull
over the vehicle.  But no one would pull over an old
VW bus or van, would they?

Jim, in Menomonie, WI
65 double cab, sounds like the fan is loose or
something
