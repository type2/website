Hi Craig,
Definitely remove the jets and check them for size first.  Last week we 
helped a AIRS list fellow who burnt a rod bearing due to running low on oil with 
his engine rebuild after only 7,000 miles on the last rebuild.  Turned out the 
carb was running way too rich washing the rings out and sucking oil into the P&
Cs.  The 125 air correction jet which was marked as such was really a 110!  
Thusly the engine was running way too rich at higher RPMs.
