Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] AridZona Full Length Bus Rack

Using a mid 70s original rack I carried 1/3 of a bus 250 miles home on top of 
my 65 westy with mostly 100* weather.  It was cut behind bulk head, and at 
windsheild pillars.  (repair metal for my 61 ).   Anyone know how much that 
weighs?  It cornered horribly.   oddly, my distributor stopped advancing at 
some point on that trip, so I set it permanently at 30 BTDC until I could get 
home and replace it.

The rack was slightly cracked AT the seams by this abuse.  Sticker on rack 
says don't load over 300lbs HAHHAHAHAHAHHA!

only rack that howled was my bug rack.  Winding bungees between the cross 
bars quieted it.   

Tom Connor's racks look sturdy and attractive.    I've only heard nice things 
about them.  They are not exact copies of VW original racks, but I don't 
think anyone cares.  It's great that someone is making quality racks.  They 
may become collectors items, you know 90s or 00s aftermarket custom repro 
stuff.
