Subject: Re: [VB] Fe & Al expansion.

Raymond,

The case does not count as George said since the dimension we are worried
about starts at the mounting surface of the case. Now, if we are looking
into what is hapening to the compression ratio as things heat up, that is
another story. I think the compression will go down slightly as the case
will expand slightly more than the connecting rods, pushing the cylinders
outward.
