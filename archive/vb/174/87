Subject: RE: [VB] gas mileage

Gary, I've built low compression engines for lots of people who are looking
for longevity vs power. There does seem to be a trade off in MPG and HP.
Most all of my "standard" engines run around 7.1-1 ~ approx and seem to have
similar mileage ratings expressed so far. That compression ratio has been,
to me at least, the median between optimum HP and MPG.

I find that the 6.6-1 compression ratio 1600cc sp in my '67(4.12-1 r&p) 
gets, on average, the lowest mpg of any VW bus engine I've built.  It 
seems bullet proof and does not get hot even while driving it wide open 
throttle all day long in desert heat.  It gets 20-22 mpg on the open 
road WOT.  This is anywhere from 55-75 mph depending on wind direction, 
wind velocity and road grade.  The bus does get 25 mpg if driven at a 
steady 45-50 mph.  I do this when I drive on back roads here in So AZ 
down to the ranch in the Huachucas.  The low cr does seem to be the 
cause of the lower mpg.  The pay off seems to be reasonable performance 
without stressing the engine.  I wonder if people running the low cr 
mexican engines have noticed lower fuel economy?   Gary Gibson
