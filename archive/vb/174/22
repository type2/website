You forgot to add the expansion rate of magnesium, the major component of
the T-1/2/3 blocks prior to '72.

Iron and steel expand at about 8 millionths of an inch per inch per degree
F. Cast iron is around 6 millionths of an inch per inch per degree F.
Aluminum expands at about 13 millionths of an inch per inch per degree F.

So, by the time you add it all up, those VW engineers really knew what they
were doing. The short aluminum height with the large expansion compensates
for the short expansion of the cast iron cylinders and so over the distance
from the case to the end of the studs, the expansion is about equal between
the two structures.

George, can you add anything to that? I don't have all the heights otherwise
I would run the numbers to prove all of it.
