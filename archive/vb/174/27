Subject: Re: [VB] Where does the other end of the oil bath cleaner hose

That is a pre heat hose.  on mid 66 s and 67 it ran forward through the front 
tin and fits onto an outlet on the right side heater box.  This is a nifty 
set up, as the pre heat air is BLOWN INTO the air cleaner.   I suspect it may 
work better than the kind where the tube runs through the rear tin and picks 
up near the head.

Nifty - a 67 with a crank hole apron.   Anyone know if crank start was a 
common option for post 36hp rescue vehicles?   Even has the resistor for the 
coil and the governor on it.

<< Hey Splitnosers,
 
   While surfing through Thoms great Vintagebus sight, I noticed a Swiss
 Ambulance that was near unmolested and looked carefully to see what the
 original set-up was in the engine compartment for the aircleaner.  I
 noticed a hose coming off the bottom side of the air cleaner.  Where does
 the other end of the hose go?
