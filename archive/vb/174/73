Subject: Re: [VB] bus heat revisited

That too.....but for now I have decided to make a few small time changes - little modifications.
Heat tube in the back is gone, has been removed. As someone pointed out this Bus was "Arizonised"
and as you know there are certain things you don't need in AZ.... like heat for instance. I intend
on putting it back and just putting everything back to stock. I might consider going with a Porsche
fan.... but that's a long distance sort of thing. I'd like to get an alternator, new fan and two
carbs in there but for now...... I'm just putting it back to stock...... in my case "Upgrade" in the
subject field really meant installing back the heat tube (one in cargo area) from a Bay window.....
instead of scavenging for an original one. I have found an original very close....
thanks, - - - - -

PS..... any tips on Porsche fan conversion and alternator/generator swap would be greatly
appreciated.

peace,
