Subject: Painting help needed

So I sandblasted a good portion of the interior of my bus (my dash was really,
really bad), then I primed and fill primed and today I painted.  I'm afraid I
didn't sand the filler primer near enough - damn!  I thought that if it felt
smooth it was fine - damn again.

So what do I do now?  Do I colour sand?  What is colour sanding?  I do have a
few runs.  I guess I just sand em out.  I'm using Acrylic Enamel - if that
makes a difference.

What sucks here is that I have never painted a car before and I'm starting
with the inside.  I'm sure the outside is going to be very easy after this.

Anyone have a formula for Seagull Grey?
