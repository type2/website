You've got it right. 6V x 3 amps = 18 watts.

Advertising claims of high power are BS if the size of the wire and fuse 
leading to the stereo won't carry the juice. That s*ny probably has an 8 
amp fuse. 12v X 8 amps = 96 watts and divided by 4 channels = 24 watts 
per channel.

18 watts divided by 4 = 4.5. That's not a lot of power. Maybe you'd be 
better off with just two speakers at 9 watts each.
