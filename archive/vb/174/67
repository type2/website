Subject: Overhead air vent

Howdy,

I am repairing and repainting my overhead air vent panel in my '66 Deluxe.
Seems someone decided to drill some holes and mount a mirror there once upon
a time. I am looking for the correct color code for the white color.  It
looks a bit lighter in shade than the L466 Silver Beige.
Thanks for the help,
