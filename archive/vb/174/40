  I don't feel like counting the fins but I would guess 20 to 30% more fins.
There is a noticable difference in the 2 coolers

Is there more than one style of T3 cooler?  Early?  Late?  I've heard of
the "tight finned" T3 cooler...are they all "tight finned" or just some.
 What constitutes "tight finned"?  How many rows??
