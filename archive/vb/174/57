If anyone has an idea of what could cause mid rod damage,
------------------------------
I haven't got a lot of experience with type 1 and 3 engines but I've got
about eight years and ten or more Type IV engines behind my experience.
The sliver out of your rod most likely happened because the rod had been
straightened. 
After filing notches in the Type IV rods its clear that they are forged.
I've found a wide variety of failures in Type IV engines.
The most prevalent is a dropped valve seat or a seat that has been
hammered back into the port.
I attribute this to poor cylinder head rebuilding.
The next most common is near new engines with about 5000 miles on them
that the alignment pin missed its hole in the bearing shell on number 3
main bearing.
The Type IV examples just represent what I've found, I'm aware that type
1 and 3 engines are different animals.
I think I'd be going back to the source that sold me the engine.
Rebuilders know that they are working with twenty year old parts and
proper examination and refitting of the parts is critical.
Since you're looking at 2000$ here I wouldn't hesitate to go to small
claims court to get a resolution.
Clearly you didn't glue the oil pump in and you didn't cause the defect
in the rod.
