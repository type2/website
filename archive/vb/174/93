Subject: Last call for John Brown's Buses

This is my last post to remind everyone that John Brown's Buses in Harpers 
Ferry , WV is taking place this weekend at the KOA.  Looks like we are 
going to have a decent weekend with temperatures in the low 60s during the 
days and low 40s at night.  There are three buses coming from Canada, a 
listee from NY, and hopefully many from the local VA, MD, and DC 
area.  I'll be arriving early afternoon on Friday.  Hope to see you there!
