The 8mm studs do not grow at the same rate as the case, but they are thin
enough to stretch when overheated.  When combined with case inserts you
may break the studs before pulling the threads.  Studs are
cheap, cases are expensive.

Unfortunately, the 8mm studs are highly stressed, making their strength
quite important.  If the metallurgy isn't just right you get broken studs
at much lower stresses than you should, as may be a problem with recent
Mexican longblocks.
