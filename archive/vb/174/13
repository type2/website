Subject: Where does the other end of the oil bath cleaner hose go?

Hey Splitnosers,

  While surfing through Thoms great Vintagebus sight, I noticed a Swiss
Ambulance that was near unmolested and looked carefully to see what the
original set-up was in the engine compartment for the aircleaner.  I
noticed a hose coming off the bottom side of the air cleaner.  Where does
the other end of the hose go?
