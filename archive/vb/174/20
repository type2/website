Pickin's are slim in the National Capital area.  The nearest
brick-and-mortar store is Peak Performance in Seabrook MD ph.
301-577-6725, near where US Route 50 hits the Capital Beltway from the
east.  They have their own website (the website looks better than the
shop!) and they sponsor VW shows in the National Capital area.  Next
closest is in Richmond--V-Dubs Restoration Parts ph. 804-747-0198. 
Further out, there's also a place in Virginia Beach and plenty more in
southern and eastern Pennsylvania.  Closer to your location is The Buggy
Man, who operates out of his home in Lorton VA and can be reached at
703-690-1408.  His shop doesn't look like much but he does manage to
show up at the Manassas Bug-In shows every year with a booth full of
parts.
