Subject: Fw: [missouri_micros] Fallout announcement?

Hi all,

I'm forwarding this to the List for Steve White with 
the Missouri Micro's Chapter of NEATO about an 
upcoming VW Campout:


Hello everyone, 

We are planning the Fourth Annual Missouri Bus
fallout. We call it that because it is a fall event, and we are camping
out. Pretty clever, though we cant take credit, as the idea for the name
was suggested to us. This year I would like to emphasize that even though
it says "bus" in the name of the campout, it is an event open to ALL
Volkswagens, and people who like them. Come in your VW of any era, or come
in your non-VW and just hang out and enjoy some good company.
