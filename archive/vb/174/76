Subject: re:6v to 12v converter

i think they may technically be called inverters, but i am not an electrical
genius-that is matt's job.

i got mine on the samba i believe, or maybe ebay-they were used. as for new
ones try busdepot, ronnie at oldvolks.com could also probably get you
one-but i don't remember seeing one on his website. i think they run aroun
$75/new.

while we are talking inverters-i have a quick question. i got these
inverters a while ago. maybe two years. i finally bought a radio last month.

the inverters say "converts 6VDC to 12VDC at 3 AMPS Maximum"

I don't want booming sound out of my radio, but i would like to be able to
hear it over my engine. also the radio came with 4 free speakers. Am i right
in assuming that it will take a lot more power to get all four speakers to
work.

The radio I bought was a s*ny that just says for specs: power requirements
12V DC. Max POwer Output 52Wx4.

So basic electronics P=IV, so power(watts) = current(amps) x voltage(volts).
So i got 3 amps max, and 12 volts, does that mean 36 watts? or do i use the
original voltage of 6, and get 18 watts. or am i just completely lost?
any suggestions on this appreciated.

thanks
