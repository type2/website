Not much. The stud screws into the case at the same plane that the
cylinders butt up against the case, so the case shouldn't affect things
much.  My references don't show that much difference in the expansion
coefficients for cast iron and steel, but aluminum is much greater.

I need some dimensions to figure out the actual expansion, but with the
info I have I know that the studs will be tensioned by higher
temperatures.
