Subject: RE: [VB] Run-In With the LAW

In AZ, you cannot drive a vehicle on public streets without a plate or
temporary
permit.

I've gotten a ticket for no plates.  The cop told me anyone with no plates
is immediately suspected of driving a stolen vehicle.

Under the new laws, if you purchase a vehicle and the seller says "keep
the plates," the plates are invalid unless they have filled out a form saying
they have transferred the plates to you.  Don't drive a car for 8 months
until the plates expire and then try to argue your way out of expired
registration
fees, guess how I found that out.

Last time I purchased a car, I took the currently registered plate off my
other VW so I could drive it home.  Also illegal... I'll risk it.

Don't run a yellow in Phoenix either, especially in front of a cop.  They
like to crack down on red light runners, whether or not you are guilty.
 The case will not be thrown out of court.
