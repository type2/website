Subject: RE: [VB] gas mileage

I've got a 67 Sundial Camper with a stock 1600 SP engine.  I was getting
16-17 mpg with an old gummy Brosol carb and a 009 dizzy.  Rebuilt a stock
solex, and changed over to a Vacuum Advance dizzy, and currently get 21-22
MPG, mostly city driving.  I did change my driving habits too, which
probably had the biggest overall effect, but changing over to the VA dizzy
really made a difference for me.
