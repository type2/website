Subject: Re: [VB] The Nose & Valance Seam  Most wanted??????

Well what makes it most wanted ?? I fab them now. That lower section extends
up past the lip sticking out and joins the bottom lip of the inner structure
to the top lip of the inner structure thus boxing it in, and i would think
adding strength, but that my thoughts , plus i wouldn't buy a slick bus with
out the lip as i would wonder what else thay short cutted on. FYI i fab the
lower nose section at the v, the lip and the lower section that slide behind
the nose to box it all in. LOOK here
