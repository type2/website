That's a good point. I will need to ask MVD what the new rules are here in
AZ. Now in AZ when you sell a vehicle you are supposed to remove the plate
and turn it in or move it to the new vehicle. If you turn them in you get a
refund on the spot of unused registration fees. Got back 18 bucks when I
turned some plates in last month!!

In New Mexico, the plates stay with the owner, and
you've got 30 days to register the vehicle in your
name, so it's legal here to drive for a MONTH w/out
plates, as long as you are carrying the paperwork,
(bill of sale, title, insurance, etc.)

It's getting worse, but it's still more laid back than
California.
