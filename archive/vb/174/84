The Chicago Tribune (9/29/2002 I believe) recently had an article on the
Concept 2 Microbus.  At the end of the article by Tom Incantalupo he
quotes several writers and refers to Type2.com:

"VW screwed up because if the new 'bus' lookes like the concept there is
nothing to be nostalgic about.  It looks no more like a bus than a
Toyota Previa."

also

"Air is not water, and water, not air."

So, if any of our VintageBus folk have contributed such comments, you
are in print all over the place (and correct IMHO).
