Subject: what are these two holes

Hi All,

Tonight, I finished up strapping down my gas tank... yes, with og felts and
chrome nuts... and as I was finishing up and tiding things in the rear
compartment, I noticed two threaded holes on the inside drivers side B
pillar... that's the pillar between the door and the rear side pop out
window.  These two holes are vertical from each other about 3-4 inches
apart.  I would suspect they're for some coat hook or something.  A quick
scan of the parts book yielded no insight.

Any thoughts?????

I guess the next item would be after figuring out what is supposed to be
there, I'd of course need one!


TIA

David
