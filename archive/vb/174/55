Subject: Now I know how Robert Davis felt.

Well, I opened up the latest VWTrends today after hearing the tipper was
shown in the article show casing the Seattle Vintage meet ... but when I saw
it, I could believe how badly the faded Velvet Green and the hand brushed
primer gray turned out.  My oldest daughter didn't even believe it was ours!
EGAD!
