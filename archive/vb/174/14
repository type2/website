Are we talking now about what we put on our racks???

I mounted my clips for my Sundial tent onto the edge of my rack, using 2 U
bolts.  That way I didn't have to drill holes into the pristine top of my
camper for the clips.  Tent is about 2-3" higher off the ground than it
normally would be, but other than that, it works really well.
