Subject: Re: [T2] Washington State to Everybus???

I should have explained.  I live in NC, about 1 hour and 30 minutes south of
the Everybus location.  Also after 2 years of trying I hope to have my
Modified 66 Kombi (Camper) there this year.  I was hoping someone that way
would be coming next year and poosibly be willing to bring one of Tom's
Racks to me there.

Here's some pictures of my  Bus:     http://www.picturetrail.com/djbrooks
