Subject: Re: [VB] gas mileage

Looking at my occasional and infrequent log of gas mileage. I have gotten a
high of 27.4 mpg (Cdn Imp gallon)which equates to about 24 mpg US. This was
fully loaded with three kids, two adults, plus complete camping load inside
and out on the westy rack,  in August and with no wind. Engine temp was
running at 210 F.

Two weeks ago in colder temperature, no roof rack and minimal load got, 23.7
mpg (Cdn)  fighting a bit of a headwind. Engine temperature was at 175 F
this time. All recorded of course at 55 mph.

Complete engine tune-up and tire pressures important. Stock gearing in this
beast.....

I am getting 20 at best, and seem to be in the mid
> teens currently.  What can be done to maximize mpg?
