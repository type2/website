In New Mexico, the plates stay with the owner, and
you've got 30 days to register the vehicle in your
name, so it's legal here to drive for a MONTH w/out
plates, as long as you are carrying the paperwork,
(bill of sale, title, insurance, etc.)

It's getting worse, but it's still more laid back than
California.
