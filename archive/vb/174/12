Subject: RE: [VB] Stud size vs head type

When the prototype was originally finalized they knew what the growth of the
engine overall was and the final torque the head bolts became. There must
have been a lot of trial and error, but the VW engine block metallurgy was
similar to some of the aircraft engines they were also designing. Aluminum
and aluminum/magnesium cases grow at different rates and to a slightly
different point. The head torque for a type-4 on it's pure aluminum block is
different than a type-1/3 on the aluminum/magnesium block because of that.

Since the studs are mounted to or near the surface of the case, 
wouldn't the growth of the case be of minimal relation to the studs 
that retain the heads? It seems reasonable that the growth of the 
cylinders would be the major cause of stud stretching. Am I missing 
something?
