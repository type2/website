Subject: Re: [VB] Stud size vs head type

Since the studs are mounted to or near the surface of the case, 
wouldn't the growth of the case be of minimal relation to the studs 
that retain the heads? It seems reasonable that the growth of the 
cylinders would be the major cause of stud stretching. Am I missing 
something?
