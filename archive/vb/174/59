Subject: Re: [VB] trying to find Will Wood

I agree, he just up and left one day.  I have no idea why.

I am kind of surprised no one keeps in touch with him..?  From what I could 
gather he had loads of busses and really knew his stuff.

My main reason for trying to find him was to potentially get a German 009 
recurved to a 019 spec all in at 2300-2500.  Long story.  The 009 all in at 
3800 is impossible for a bus, as we all know.

Thanks,
Adrian
