 .....I've lounged/played cards/etc. on a og full length roof rack w/ 5-6
consenting adults, spare tire, gas can, adult beverages, etc. for several
hours at a time, & not a problem at all w/ the rack or gutters. A ladder
really helps to keep a nice bus from getting trashed while volks of various
degrees of coordination/flexibility/sobriety/etc. try to get on & off.

 ......My personal record is 12 sheets of  5/8" gyp. bd. on a Yakima style
rack on an A6 wagon! Who says Audi doesn't make a utility vehicle.( only 4
load points & Mfr's limit of 110 lbs. on each rack! NOT!)

Does VW  mean 220# per load point???
