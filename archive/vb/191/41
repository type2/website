Subject: Split window at Dead show

Hey Y'all,
This is a Friday-ish post, but I spotted a 64-67 Westy in downtown
Indianapolis going to the Grateful Dead (The Other Ones) show on Sunday, was
that a listmember? I spotted you through the window of the bar we were in. 
Blue and White pop-top between 64-67, just curious.
BTW, Excellent Show!! Although the Security were a bit too affectionate with
the searches they were doing at the door, I have never been felt down like
that without even so much as a kiss or dinner!

Peace, John Baker
