Subject: Re: [VB] Lowered Bus Question

My friend had an early panel that was dumped and it
was funny to watch him change his rear tires. He had
to jack it up and turn the wheel just to get at the
lugs! I always thought it a lot of work just to look
"cool" around town. Its not like he could follow my
Westfalia on a camping trip or anything!:)
