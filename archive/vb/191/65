Subject: Re: [VB] Lowered Bus Question

i helped drop my freinds 59' first time we both did it....after we did it we
could not get the tired back on...it was a royal bit(-at-)#!!!! we had the axles
off the spring plates with the tire free on the drum...you had to roll
everything to get it on
ive been debating lowering my single cab...but ive been having 2nd thoughts.


good luck!
