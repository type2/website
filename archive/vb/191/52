Ahh,---
Ya know Dave --I did some more reading after you mentioned me doing some
looking before the leaping thing---
Ahh---
It's a water based process---
And with that in mind--this stuff at best is more than likely intended
for the art deco interior stuff that ain't gonna get any road rash--or
weather changes or whatever---

I recall some water based alternative paint that a few automotive giants
used a few years back--yea-baby--I remember the primer alternative look
well--:>)

Yep --I leaped again---with a parachute.
( this is called Terrysailing )

I'll get my Polish chrome at JC Whintowski, or at Ace is the Place--a
bit more resonable there--:>)

Spray on chrome ( no such thing )
 
 Do your own chrome. A alternative to plateing. http://www.alsacorp.com>

( there is no such thing as alternative plating--it's the real
electro--nickel--chromium thing or bust--)
