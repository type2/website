Subject: Seat area replacement

Anyone here ever replaced a seat pedestal/bulkhead
section?  Mine is hacked seven ways to Sunday, and I have
a replacement piece, just looking for hints.   The plan that
I've come up with so far is to cut along the back, on
the horizontal portion, a couple inches back from the bulkhead,
then cut the bulkhead to match, and butt-weld the two together.
Any ideas welcome.

Thom
