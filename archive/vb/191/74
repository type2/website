Subject: Re: [VB] Lowered Bus Question

I forgot to add the smile face to the end of my post, I love harassing you
lowered bus guys,you get soooo upset. Funny thing is the Guys with lowered
busses that harp on others about correctness such as colors, interiors or
accessories. Stock height is great but I prefer the Raised look, something
like these here: http://www.baja.com/kombi/buspictures.htm

Changing an oversized tire that barely fits in the wheel well WITH fenders
is a big pain also.
keepin it up
