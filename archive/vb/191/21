Subject: RE: [VB] re:staying warm / cab divider

how did you get the shape? just a lot of measuring, and mock up with
cardboard? or is there a template on a site that can be printed out?

I made a cab divider out of heavy guage clear vinyl recently, in order
to stay warm on a round trip Tucson to Detroit.  This worked very well
and I stayed warm in a somewhat drafty '67 bus.
