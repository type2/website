If you're going this route go across northern Arizona at the Vermillion
Cliffs and go to the north rim of the Grand Canyon.  I don't see Yosemite
as a substitute for the Grand Canyon.  You trade awesome for crowded.
Don't discount the state parks in the West.  Many of them are just as
spectacular as the national parks and much less crowded.

Buses shouldn't have problems with altitude.  They just run a bit slower.
I've taken my low-compression 1600 bus over 12,000 foot passes with no
problem.  All it takes is gears.
