You should tell your dad to look for buses there. I got two of the most rust
free cleanest buses I have ever owned from that area, A 1960 SC and 1960 DC
(which I still have)

FWIW, I talked with my father-in-law down in Borrego Springs night before 
last.  They were having their first rain in three years.  There actually 
might be wildflowers next spring. (If it keeps raining...) ;o) The drought 
has been so severe in the southern desert that his fifty year old cactii 
(suguaro) have died.
