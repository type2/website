Maybe theu deflate the tires to install/remove, and inflate them when the 
wheel is on.

I did this to remove a front left tire from a bus that was mushed, It hit a 
tree, and the wheel well was against the tire.   My friend was okay (slipped 
on an icey road), and I ended up with the bus for parts (after someone else 
stripped stuff first) and my bus ended up with a nice set of tires.

 How do you guys with slammed buses change your rear tires? >>
