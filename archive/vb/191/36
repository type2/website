  If I am not mistaken (I have been before) they are the people who bought?
out Mark Stevens stuff when he went out of business and a couple of Marks X

OK, so, not a lot of info there.

Anyway, I saw a price list today. Really low prices, e.g resurfaced
flywheels $19.95, 1600
longblocks $599.00. Just wondering how their quality is.
