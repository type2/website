Hi Kevin,
Could be!  If you had adjusted the clutch cable adjustment too tight the 
clutch will slip constantly while driving and scorch the clutch disc to the 
point that it will glaze over with a glasslike layer and eventually heat the 
clutch pressure plate springs in it to the point that the springs loose there 
memory and no longer have thier springiness.  Could also your FW and/or 
tranny input shaft seal has failed and allowed oil to leak over the FW and 
clutch.  An oil leak can also happen if you cracked the engine case just in 
front of #3 cylinder which often happens in stocker cases (which do not have 
that area thickened) that have been bored open for bigger bore cylinders.  So 
check where the engine and tranny mate up for oil leakage on the ground.
Good Luck,   Eric&Barb
