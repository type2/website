FWIW, I talked with my father-in-law down in Borrego Springs night before 
last.  They were having their first rain in three years.  There actually 
might be wildflowers next spring. (If it keeps raining...) ;o) The drought 
has been so severe in the southern desert that his fifty year old cactii 
(suguaro) have died.
