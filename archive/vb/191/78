I though the deal with 8 doweled FW is that they are matched and balanced 
with the crank.  The dowels are not exactly regular, so the FW only goes on 
one way.  FWIW my bugster has a 8 doweled crank and FW, stock weight.   I 
dunno if the crank is conterweighted or not.

Yes you can just use 4 dowels, or why not get them balance together?  I think 
they drill dimples into te eFW to balance it.
