Subject: Lowered Bus Question

This is just out of morbid curiosity:

How do you guys with slammed buses change your rear tires?
I was trying to remove the rear wheels from my doublecab last
night, and it was a royal b!tch.  With the bus completely
off the ground, shocks disconnected, I still couldn't get
the wheel off without bending the quarter panel a *lot*.  I
had to bow the hell out of it to get the wheel out of there.
As Johnny Cochran once said - "it does not make sense!"  Now
I know why I see so many bent quarters on lowered buses - the first
flat tire out in BFE instills metal-mangling-mania to get the 
wheels off and on and back on the road.  No thanks.
