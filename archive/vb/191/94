74's do not have larger discs. 71 to 79 are all the same size.
The difference between 71/72 and 73-79 is in the calipers. 73 and up calipers
are wider. They use thicker brake pads. Except for the thickness, the
dimensions of the pads are the same. They just last longer. You can use 71/72
pads in a 73+ bus.
