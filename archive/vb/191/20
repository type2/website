Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch Woes

If my clutch started to slip, I'd look under the bus at the drip spots.  Is 
there a drip spot coming from the seam between the engine and the tranny?   
Cause often a slipping clutch means the main seal is leaking and oil is 
getting on the clutch.

Sounds like it's time for an engine pull.   so you can
examine clutch and replace what's needed
remove FW and check main seal& o ring- replace if oozing
replace oil cooler seals - should be done if the main seal is done
replace old fuel line
replace engine to body seal if it's crusty.
replace any dead grommets for the wiring at the front right side of the 
engine compartment
check to make sure all your engine tin is in good shape.

FWIW it's really easy to adjust valves when the engine is out.

<< OK volks,
 
 I posted last week about needing to adjust my clutch, as it was getting hard
 to shift.  Thanks for the many replies.  I never got a chance to crawl under
 there, and today, I was on my way..., and the clutch started slipping.  I
 nursed it home, but going up hills was particularly bad.(and I live at the
 top of a hill!)
 
 I adjusted the cable some, with no great improvement.  Am I looking at a
 pressure plate replacement? - Thanks
