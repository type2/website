Terry,
Look before you leap!!!   



Ronnie, it looks pretty interesting.  Three step painting though...

Check it out here also http://www.fantachrome.com/home.htm


base
multi-step paint and wash application
clear-coat

They show pics of it on virtually everything!

And you can do "gold" and other "colors"

Once site appeared to have a complete set up for about $3500...a little 
steep for us "prosumers", but maybe ok if you were going to do a few 
things for the mercedes/lexus crowd.

Real interesting!!!  Thanks for the info.

Cheers ,dave
