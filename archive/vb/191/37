Subject: re:accelerator cable cutting tranny case

i think i was the first poster on this recently...many suggestions came my
way. I ended up using what i beleive is called Synflex. This is a trademark
name, so I think there are similar things under different names. I purchased
it at a local place that does brakes for large trucks. Do not remember the
cost-but definitely under $10. It is basically like the stuff your bicycle
cables go through, just bigger, and more heavy duty.

good luck
