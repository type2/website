Subject: Fw: GIANT BEES, HELP!

 I need your help desperately!  It rained over the weekend while we were away
and I just went outside to air out the Westy and "IT'S INFESTED WITH GIANT
BEES"!  These things are HUGE!  It has happened before about two or three
years ago and I received some advice from Jim Ellis and a few others but I
don't remember what I did to get rid of them!  HELP PLEASE!.
 Local exterminators are no help.  I did manage to take a picture, it's at:

Thanks for your support!
