In summer, I'd stay north or at high altitude.  I try do do that, but
sometimes the hot weather follows me.  Who would expect 105F in Buffalo,
Montana?

If you're heading for SoCal, perhaps a Route 66 trip might be fun.  The
highway doesn't exist any more, but it is fun to seek out the remnants.
If you want a more northerly route, US50 is less known, but virtually
intact and provides a "blue highways" trip over most of the route you're
interested in.

Now is the time to hit all those state tourism web sites and order their
brochures.  You can lay out a lot of local events to hit (or avoid) during
your trip.
