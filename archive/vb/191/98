<< Hi Collie,
 If you have a 68/69 front beam you can install the disc brakes on that beam 
 and fit it in your pre-1968 bus.  The problem is that will raise the front 
of 
 the bus.  So you will either have to raise the rear (Not recommended without 
 going to IRS!) or figure out how to lower the front.

I was going to use 15" rims on the rear and 14" on the front.  the idea being 
that the tire sizes would even the truck out.
