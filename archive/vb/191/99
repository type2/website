Subject: Re: [VB] Beam Swap (was Re: [VB] Lowered Bus Question)

I think more folks are talking smack about the perceived 
anti-anything-not-100% -stock-people than people are saying things anti- 
lowering.     Why are the pro lowering folks so aggro?    Get a grip.   It's 
a free country, and now the gov't is more free to keep files on all of you.   
  anyway...

I understand that the 68-69 beam bolts right onto the splitty.  But the later 
beam doesn't.    I you want you can remove the drum ball joints and i think 
swap the trailling arms in from a later bay to get disc brakes.  Used to have 
a 59 truck with a drum brake ball joint front end under it.  Made the front 
taller.  Rode funny too.  Better brakes than stock 59 brakes though.  

oops, though I had already sent this before I sent the other one.  Ya I was 
planning on putting 15" on the rear and leaving the 14" on the front (ya it 
came to me all 14" rims, very bastardised truck) to even out the stance.

AGREED! every darn time this comes up there are people who feel its their 
duty to talk smack to the people who want to lower their bus. if you dont 
have advice on the subject, keep it to yourself!
