I live real close to these people, and although they've tried to get some 
old parts unsuccessfully for me, they seemed alright, in person that is.  
With that said:

I've heard a few horror stories from others dealing with them via mail and 
phone so beware if you plan on that route.  for example, sending the wrong 
stuff and then claiming they didn't sell it to you so no refund/exchange.  
If they're still like they were in the past you need to be very specific on 
your used parts requests, because I've gotten the feeling they don't know 
their VW parts all that well.  As for engines, they're cheap because they're 
cheap.  My VW Mechanic (Hal Capps (-at-) Valley VW in Palmdale) doesn't think too 
highly of their outfit either.

Just my opinion and experiences,

Alex
