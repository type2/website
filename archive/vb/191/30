Subject: Re: [VB] Accelerator cable cutting

Nylon big rig airline called synflex. 1/4" fits right over the end and if
you remove the fan shroud tube you can slide it though the shroud then
reinstall the tube. Napa, truck dealer, hose shop or truck stop should be
able to supply it. Works great.

While out in the garage looking for the nylon tubing to make sure that the
tubing will fit over the end (and it did) I found a bowden tube for the
accelerator cable in a bucket of stuff by accident. No part # on it though.
End to end it is 23 1/2" long with a flared end for the fan shroud tube to
fit into that is 3/4" back on one end and the end that fits over the cable
tube is 7/16" back from the other end. I am not sure as to weather this came
off a bug or a bus (shoot I did not know I even had one) but those are the
dimensions of the one I have. If you use a piece around 22 5/16" it should
be close and you can trim it from underneath. You could also get some rubber
tubing for each end to seal it up. With the cable in place measure from the
cable tube to the shroud tube + a little for flex (like a bowden tube). Then
cut the tubing to length (bevel the inside of the synflex at both ends for
easy cable replacement should the cable break so it does not hang up going
through), remove the cable, slip one rubber tube on, the synflex, the other
rubber tube and feed the cable back through. Hose clamp the rubber hoses and
reconnect the cable to the carb.
