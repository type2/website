Yup, I'd suggest doing a different route for there and back too.  I haven't 
taken a splitty to the south since I took the 59 to Georgia in 91.  Forget 
which route that was, but it was not very direct.  Went over Independence 
Pass in Colorado, that was the road through Aspen, and was a great narrow 
twist mountain road and the pass really high- perfect for a splitty.

 Hi Bryan,
 Do both routes!  One on the way out, and the other on the way back.  >>
