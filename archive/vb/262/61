Subject: RE: [VB] friday question - coffee names

-For a mellow roast:   'Slammit'
-For the high test:    'SkyHook' (I can see a picture of my v80 on the
logo)
-For the smooth roast: 'Drop Top'  (but the term is being a bit over
used lately)
-For the decaf...      '411' (i.e. why bother :-O ...)


... I like Stans 'westy warmer' suggestion.
