Taylor, maybe out in left field but I had a dry bearing issue on my 71 westy
in which the spindle really got hot and melted the rubber speedo sheath right
through the inner metal sheath and froze up the speedo cable. In doing so it
also rounded out the grease cap hole. On my 67 SC the grease cap hole was also
rounded out but I brazed it and filed it out square to match with a jewelers
file.

Hey all,


Fast forward to last Sunday.  Drive out to Buses in the Shop and everything's
cool.  Go to leave the show and the needle jumps a couple times and then
registers nothing!  Augh, I think, killed another cable.  I half expected to
pull off the hubcap and find the clip sucked into the dustcap and obvious
signs of brokenness.  Believe it or not, nope.  The cable and the clip look
just fine!  So I go to loosen the cable and see if maybe things weren't lining
up just right...and I could not get the cable to loosen at the back of the
speedo at all.  Maybe I just have weak fingers, but it wouldn't budge.
