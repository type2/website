   I have used a 4 or 5 mm bolt with a wide washer and nut to hold in a

Hi Rex,
There is supposed to be a steel clip that locks the right side of the fuse 
box to the frame.

isn't it on the left side of the fuse box?


I have seen them siliconed in place,  sort of permanent, but worked

but you can get a clip from WW I think.  I got one somewhere mail order for 
the 67 riviera.
