Subject: I'm a bus driver again!

Hi all - I've finally, after 2 years, been driving, and using my '65 EZ 
Camper daily this week.  I put in a rebuilt tranny, transplanted the 
motor from the 60 dc and registered it.  I'm using it as a work truck 
for a kitchen gutting/remodeling job I'm doing for my friends sister. 
(I teach 5th grade, but do this kind of stuff in the summer).

Today, I had my first mechanical failure/quick fix/back on the road in 
5 minutes event(Busted Carb Spring), so I figured it was time to post 
as that usually marks the time that "the bus" becomes "my bus"  It is 
running, driving and working its butt off, and seems to be loving it.  
Haven't driven a bus since since early May when I sold my '71 Westy, 
and it's just great to be back on the road in style :)  Thanks again to 
all on this list who helped make this day happen

Reality check is I probably will be selling it in the fall to move on 
to the dc project, and finally create some space in my overfstuffed 
garage for a very old, but impeccably cared for Wheel Horse tractor 
with every convievable accesory that my uncle wants to give me for 
free.  Oh well, life is full of tough choices ;)
