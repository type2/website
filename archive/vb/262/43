Subject: Almost a heart attack ..

Driving down the highway today and the crack in the horn button plastic broke
through .. shot up in the air and came down in my lap.  I didn't see what it
was yet, I just kept thinking "what the hell was that?"  Then I looked down
and saw the spring vibrating ... it was funny .. now .. but then .. I almost
had a heart attack.

The day ended great though .. first time I looked at my bus and didn't want to
weep ..
