Subject: RE: [VB] friday question - coffee names

how about:
"12V Conversion" for the regular brew, the one that
just perks you up a bit.
"Freeway Flier"  for the extra dark, large sized
coffee, the one that gets you going a bit faster.
"Fridolin" since it was such a hodge-podge of various
type VW parts, this could be for the mix of various
beans for that special, slightly unusual flavor.
"Oil Change" for the double brewed, triple espresso,
chewy, mud type coffee. (I'll take 3!)
