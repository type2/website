The public is in control of every manufacturers fate.
If you don't like their product quality, price or policy ................
simply don't buy from them or their dealers, distributors or direct.
I'm currently working on shutting down China by refusing to buy anything
made in China.
It's in your hands.
Remember it was the American buying public that nearly put Chrysler Corp
out of the Auto Business.
