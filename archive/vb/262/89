Twas writ:

As a master's level psychologist working with the severe mentally ill, I
couldn't agree more.  I have filed a new disorder in our bible, the
DSM-V,
called Davidmayes Hyperactivity Disorder, it is a combination of Freud's
Anal Retentive disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and Oppositional
Definant Disorder.
