Blessings Beautiful Being,
pawlkat here in Prescott, AZ.

I am ready to sell my Green 1966 Volkwagen non-pop top Westfalia
camper.Good louvered camper windows.  Rebuilt dual port 1600 engine.
12volt. Ivory reproduction seat covers and front door panels. Deep Puple
rear benches and bed covers. Nice, original veneer headliner and veneer
rear panels. am/fm cassette.

I Will consider trade for diesel vanagon/westfalia/or other diesel
camper or $6,000. I am a grassroots community organizer and the money or
traded vehicle will allow me to begin a series of diesel conversions to
run on free waste veggie oil and help others do the same..
