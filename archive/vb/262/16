Subject: RE: [VB] Steam Clean an Engine?

So,

	What are the benefits of cleaning "all the carbon build up off the valves
and pistons"?

	AND.. can it actually cause/reveal problems that the carbon is currently
helping/hiding?

  Automatic trans fluid poured slowly down the carb at 2000 rpms will clean
all the carbon build up off the valves and pistons. Just SMOKES a lot, watch
out that somebody doesn't call the fire department.
