Hi Rex,
There is supposed to be a steel clip that locks the right side of the fuse 
box to the frame.

Two prong will work you just need to hook two of the three wires to one 
terminal and the other wire to the other terminal.  A 3 relay prong should work 
with one wire per terminal, but sometimes they have to be wired as a two prong.
