Subject: Jerome Jamboree XII Bus help--

On another note: I just spent most of the evening stripping down the pop-out
windows. 3 of the 6 are pretty rusted along the bottom. I can make them work
if I absolutely have to, but it sure would ge great to get better ones for a
bus that is going to be as nice as this one will be. Could you keep an eye
out for some? Or perhaps put the word out. Maybe someone will donate them.
