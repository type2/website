Subject: Anyone in Salt Lake City, Utah to check out a bus?

There is a bus in Salt Lake I am very interested in and I was wondering
if there was anyone on the list in that area that might be able to look
it over before I do the whole plane ticket thing. The other thing would
be any recommendations for a shop there to look at the bus for me in
advance.
thanks,
