Subject: Coffee Names - WOW!!

Listees,

Wow, you guys have really come up with some great ideas!  I have a short list
forming.  Keep the great ideas rolling.  Here are some of the straight coffees
that I have...  Colombia, costa rica, sumatra, guatemala, ethiopia, brazil,
kenya  I also have about 5 regular blends.  I think we can up the number to
about 10 names needed.  Thanks again guys (and gals)
