Subject: Re: [VB] firewall grommets

The problem with conventional grommets is that they are meant for
electrical use and not tough enough to take the continuous pressure of the
weight of the line.

Here's my "quickie" solution, that so far has lasted several years in two
vehicles:

Take a long strip of inner-tube rubber about two inches wide.  Wrap it
around and around the fuel line until the diameter is a bit bigger than
the hole in the tin.  Cut off the excess and push the roll of inner-tube
rubber through the hole in the tin.

This method has some advantages over conventional grommets and mechanical
solutions:

1. It provides a nice large bearing surface for the fuel line with no
pressure points or bending moments on the line.
2. It is long-lasting
3. It is fail-safe (if the rubber does get cut by the tin, it starts on
one end of the strip and is evident long before the line is endangered)
4. It's cheap!
5. It can be applied without taking the rubber hose off of the fuel line.

If you don't have inner-tube rubber, just keep an eye on the roadside for
an inner tube that has blown out of a truck tire.  One of these will
provide rubber for dozens of buses!
