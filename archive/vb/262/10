Hey, I wanted to thank everyone for their thoughts regarding the speedo 
cable.  When I get to work today, I'll pop the cap back off and inspect it 
for any rounding-out.  I'll also buy a six pack of Red Bull before I 
attempt that cable nut...just seems ripe for being the next RB 
commercial!  Hopefully it'll just be a case of rounding-out and it'll be an 
easy fix...seems like little is with my camper these days.  Of course, if 
the speedo itself gave up the ghost (do speedos have ghosts?) then I have 
the original speedo ready to go back in now that my dad's taken the time to 
restore it.  :)

Heehee, all this and a new engine by mid-August!
