Howdy volks,

I was just reading Don J's post about his "quick fix" on the '66 that
has been off the road for two years, and how he was going to sell it to
work on a DC project.

Then it occured to me, like a jolt of inspiration, so-to-speak.  It
would be interesting to take a random sampling of this list and have
them "shrinked out."  That is, given a full psycological profile by a
clinician. 

I bet you anything we are collectively in better mental health than a
random sampling of the general population.  Why?  'Cos we have a hobby
that we all love.  It is a great stress reliever, time occupier, and
provider of a general sense of enjoyment and satisfaction.  

Not that frustration never sets in.  

Any shrinks in the house, amateur or otherwise?

Best,
