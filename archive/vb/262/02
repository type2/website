Subject: Need SoCal bodyshop

Hello list,

Karma must not be on my side. If you remember, I asked you all for
recommendations on an appraiser here to get my bus valued and properly
insured just this morning. 

At lunch today, I swung wide on a 4 lane street to make a u-turn and
somebody took that as an invitation to pass me. I got about 1/2 way
around and they hit me in the left-side cargo doors and bulkhead. With
sadness in my heart, I am now needing a bodyshop that can do some
serious cuting and welding in addition to good body work. The police are
saying that it's my fault for turning from the wrong lane, but... ??

It looks like I'll need a new pillar behind the drivers door, a pair of
cargo doors (1960), the cargo door sill, maybe a drivers dogleg and a
drivers door. 

As to my condition, I hit my head pretty hard on the top of the door
frame and knocked my leg against the speedo pod. With less than 6"
between the impact spot and my butt, the bus did a great job of
protecting me and I am thankful to her for that.

I only have liability insurance (hence the appraiser question), so all
sheetmetal and labor are coming out of my pocket. If anyone can help out
with parts for fair prices, I would _really_ appreciate it.

Regards,

~Rich Barker

PS - I only got one response to the appraiser question (suggested
Richard Kimball), but would still like to find somebody...
