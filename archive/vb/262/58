Subject: Re: [VB] friday question - coffee names

What I need from the list is this, I need 4 names
for blends of coffee.  I would like to keep them VW related, they do not
have
to be all bus related.  The 4 lucky winners will each get a pound of
fresh
roasted coffee with their blend name.  Thanks all, come see me at
Volksfest in
September!!!! -Tom Purdum
