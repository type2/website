Subject: [VB] friday question - coffee names


 Some of you may or may not know that I am in the process of converting my
58
 panel into a mobile espresso van.  It will make it's debut at the Volksfest
in
 Naches, WA September 13th.  What I need from the list is this, I need 4
names
 for blends of coffee.  I would like to keep them VW related, they do not
have
 to be all bus related.  The 4 lucky winners will each get a pound of fresh
 roasted coffee with their blend name.  Thanks all, come see me at Volksfest
in
 September!!!!
