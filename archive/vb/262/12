Subject: Steam Clean an Engine?

Somebody mentioned this in a forum, and I was wondering if any of you had
ever heard of it being performed.  If you slowly drop water down your carb
while your engine is running, it will slowly "steam clean" your pistons,
cylinders, heads, and exhaust.  Has anybody on the list done this before?
Did it work?  What was the procedure?
