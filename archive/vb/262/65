Don brings up a good point.  

Where ever I go and kids see my truck its always a long stare and
"mommy/daddy look at that!"  My kids are a bit jaded since VWs are a
part of our life, but its always a kick to drive them to school in
it...better than a limo my daughter says. 

 I was at an IN-N-OUT (So. Cal. tradition) one evening in the drive
through that adjoined the outdoor seating area, when a few small kids
ran up to my window and started oohing and awing at the truck.  They
were almost mesmerized by the truck and started hurling questions.
"What's that?" one asked, and "why does it have a face?"  I smiled and
answered as best I could and glanced at the not so approving parents who
obviously had their own preconceived ideas of what it was, and more
importantly, who I was...or was like.

Funny how we change when we grow up.  Innocence lost?  Well, maybe not
always if you're driving in something with a "face".
