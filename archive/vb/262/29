Subject: Picture Explanation from last year      www.bustrips.org

http://www.bustrips.org/tgwt/2/catalog%20data/62.html

    I was going through some of the pictures from last years trip to
Yellowstone    and came across this picture of myself that I think is pretty
cool.  What I did was take the camera and wrap the tie real tight to my hand
and stuck that camera out the window as far as I could and took a picture of
myself driving down the road on a puffy clouded day.
Kind of introspective also .........I think!?

Leaving on a 2 week trip to Glacier National park on Sunday and we should be
updating  www.bustrips.org on the road when we get access!
We will be traveling from the Salt Lake City area towards Colorado the week
before RMMW/Finel;ine show so if ya want to hook up get hold of me or Terry.
His address is buskatier(-at-)hotmail.com


For a temporary mobile solution to my emailing needs I have created this email
account for reaching me on our trip.  captoaster(-at-)yahoo.com   Again access will
be spotty!!
Justin will be going with his Mom to Colorado during this time and he will not
be going with me this year.  Might try and grab him in Colorado though when we
go to the RMMW/Fineline Bug In shows on the weekend of August 9th
