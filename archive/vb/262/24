Subject: RE: [VB] Steam Clean an Engine?

A lot of carbon in your combustion chamber will raise
the compression ratio too, making your engine knock. 
Also, hot spots will preignite the mixture, both bad
things.  In the early days of automobiles, it was
common practice to "decarbonize" an engine quite often
by pulling the head and physically scraping the
carbon, hence all the shortcuts as previously
mentioned.  (Pulling the head on a flathead engine is
pretty easy, though.)
