  Automatic trans fluid poured slowly down the carb at 2000 rpms will clean
all the carbon build up off the valves and pistons. Just SMOKES a lot, watch
out that somebody doesn't call the fire department.

ps. Got really greasy hands, wash them with ATF, works better then soap!

Somebody mentioned this in a forum, and I was wondering if any of you had
ever heard of it being performed.  If you slowly drop water down your carb
while your engine is running, it will slowly "steam clean" your pistons,
cylinders, heads, and exhaust.  Has anybody on the list done this before?
Did it work?  What was the procedure?
