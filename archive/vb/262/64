Here's a couple of coffee names for you:
"Hydraulic Lifter"- This would need to be a strong,
wake-up type of blend.
"Blue Green Plaid"- could be a blend of different
beans.
"Yellow Vinyl"- a smooth, slippery kind of blend.
"Upright Flat Four"- pick a blend of 4 different beans
here.
"53 MPH"- A nice mellow, after dinner, kicking back
and relaxing type of blend

Heres some names NOT to use:
"Burnt Oil"
"Leaky Gasket"
"Black Driveway Spot"
"Dropped Valve seat"
"Spongy Pedal"
"Exhaust Aroma"
