Re:how to install a fuse box.

Not sure aobut the earlier models, but mine had a little notch on the
passenger side, that fits over the metal surrounding the holder. And the
drivers side is held up tight with a bolt/washer hook up like Ronnie
suggested. I have no idea if this is an original set up, but its original to
me ;)

I have a 67 can take photos,  plus a freshly solderd spare to go in,  mail me 
off list if you like. Mike
