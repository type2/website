Subject: Re: [VB] Fuse box clip

I always look for clips in bugs at salvage yards. Most have some rust, but are 
serviceable. I gave away most of 'em at the classic weekend to listees. Ronny 
should have 'em in stock. 


You can use ty-wraps in a pinch. 


If you're doing major troubleshooting with the fusebox off the frame cover the 
metal areas that it can possibly touch with electrical tape or even duct tape.
