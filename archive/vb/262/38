Years ago when I did water cooled engines there was such a thing as water
injection which added extra volume to each piston raising compression and
really kept the pistons and valves clean.

Yep.  If a water-cooler gets a head gasket leak between the water jacket
and the cylinder, the affected piston and cylinder will often be nice and
clean when you take the head off.
