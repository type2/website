I brazed over the hole after verifying a square end to the cable and then
drilled it and filed it square to match. I then hooked up the cable again and
then disconnected it from the back of the speedo. While driving I could reach
under the dash and feel the cable turning so I knew that part was good. Then I
replaced the speedo.

Hey all,



Nope.  I could see the clip was still, the gob of grease on the clip was
still, and the cable end was still.  Ladies and gents, I do believe I have
a rounded out dust cap.

Comments?  Other thoughts?
