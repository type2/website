Subject: 1971 Bus

Just bought a speedo for my 1971 bus, installed it, and it works fine. 
There's a problem with the oil sender. Changed out same, and it still didn't 
work. Looked up the
diagram in the Bug book for 1971 and found that the light that is supposed to 
come on doesn't, and that there is likely an open circuit somewhere between 
the sender unit and the light bulb. I have assumed that the bug is about the 
same as a bus, and
this therefore makes sense.

The engine is tapping slightly, sounds like the rocker arms to me. Checked 
the valves
and found that one was opened greatly. But the tapping noise didn't go away. 
I asked about it and was told that setting the valves too loose causes such a 
tapping noise. This bugs me. I don't know what the meaning of tapping vs. not 
tapping is. The choke mechanism didn't work either. So, I bought a new choke 
mechanism and will install it tomorrow.
