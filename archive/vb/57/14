On close inspection, that conversion looks very simple.  Build a
reinforced box, cut a hole, find two long appreciate hinges, mount the
gates, buy the ram....make the pump electric and remotely operated.

Sounds like a good project.   While you're at it make it a wide bed
conversion too.  :-)

Cool.
