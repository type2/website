Subject: ADMINS: downtime tomorrow night/move


Tomorrow night we're going to be facing some unexpected downtime. This
will affect all type2.com and vintagebus.com services. (irc also.)

I've just found out that Verio has broken their agreement with Atlasta
regarding the move (which we were supposed to have another month or two to
get done) to the new datacenter...

They've been instructed that they must be out (of the old datacenter) by
the 26th...which, what with the holidays, means tomorrow night we're going
to have and unscheduled and unprepared move.

I'm rolling out of town after work tomorrow, but I'll try to get access
once the box is up in the new rack (with a new IP address) to make sure
all the service come up.

DNS, for those whos cache servers honor expire times (in other words, AOL
customers are up shit creek as usual..) should propogate in only 15
minutes... 128.241.97.68 will be the new IP, for your records.


Anyway.  sorry for the short notice...

.....david
