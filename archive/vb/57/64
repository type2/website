Subject: VW garage sale in NH


Hi Folks,

In an effort to clean out my Barn I'm going to have a VW garage sale
right after the first of the New Year...

I have tons of stuff for Bays, Splitties, and Vanagons...

Also FS will be two '83.5 water-cooled Westies, a 1965 Panel (converted
to Sundial camper, then gutted at some point), and the nose & both sides
(double cargo door) of a '59 panel.

I've got a couple of 2.0L short blocks (one solid lifter, one hydraulic
lifter), one VGC 1500 Bus case, and one AE 1600 dp case.

    Both front doors w/glass and the rear hatch w/o glass in VGC from a
'73 westy (in white)

    This will be ongoing for the entire month of January with the
exception of MLK birthday (Jan. 19 & 20)

    If you're interested in seeing what I have, either e-mail me or call

           Jon-reed Hathaway

        (603) 673-1302

    Available most evenings, some days, and all weekends except as
stated above...
