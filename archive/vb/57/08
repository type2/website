Subject: 71 master cylinder conversion

Hey,
I finally got the (poor quality) pics from my 71 brake master cylinder
conversion on my 67 SC. I have an assortment of pics ranginging from the
original 67 dual circuit master cylinder, the componets required for late
model conversion, and the late model conversion installed. Eric and Barb
inspired me to do this mod from their article in the library of type2.com
and I think these pics need to be stored someplace for future reference to
others. OK, now where do I send them ?
