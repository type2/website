Hi Ray,
Sounds like you might have a VW accessory #,
ZVW 163 201
ZVW 163 205
or the later,
ZVW 818 602
ZVW 818 603
We have used several of these to tow type 1s behind our bus and truck.  In a 
pinch have towed buses, but do not recommend it!  Any towing done must be 
safety chained between the towed item and the tow vehicle.
