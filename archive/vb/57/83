Subject: RE: [VB] 1966 bus preheat system?

Thank you, this is the information I needed. I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE PART
any where around here! The parts manual did show it well, but not in
retrospect to the rest of engine. With the part, that would probably
have been intuituve as to how to install it.
Now, air cleaner end...Is it only a weighted flap then?> No cable,
tstat, springs, or doo dads?
The system as I see it now, is weighted flap, hose to tin on drivers
side, seal at tin hole. Clamps on hose ends, and the magical metal piece
I need.
Thanks,
Happy Holidays,
Al

Al--

The preheat hose setup can be hard to visualize if you have never seen
it done correctly.  Most buses I have seen on the East Coast are missing
the part you need--I figure it gets lost during an engine removal.  And
the Type 2 parts manual shows what it is but not where it attaches.
First of all, there is supposed to be a rubber sealing grommet in the
hole in the engine tin where the paper hose passes to underneath the
engine.  Once underneath, the paper hose fits over the flat end of a
stubby round metal tube (the missing part) that has a small attachment
tab.  If you look at the rear of the underside tin there should be an
oval hole through it, in the area of the pushrod covers.  The stubby
metal tube has an angled end which is inserted in that oval hole.  The
attachment tab is fitted on one of the existing bolts nearby where the
heat exchanger and muffler are connected together.  (I think this is
correct, it's too cold and windy right now for me to go outside and
stick my head underneath.)  Once you have the part and can fiddle with
its position in the oval hole, the correct attachment bolt should become
evident.

It took me over a year to find this part.  It wasn't until a business
trip to the Left Coast that I was able to visit a VW parts recycler and
find one.  Then I was finally able to figure out where it went.
