Subject: Email down 

Hiya folks short but sweet if you e-mailed me between tuesday and this
morning and i haven't responded, i might have lost is so resend , My email
got clogged at the server by a corrupt message or something ,, i dunno my
nephew finally got it worked out. I'm running off my laptop for now as my
other one is having a chip fart or something. Bus content, Douglas Lloyd
picked up his 67 deluxe sat and returned to tn with it ,, hopefully he'll
have it on the road soon. The mango 60 walk through is back in the
shop..Later
