List:

I'm not sure what exactly they're called, but they are the aluminum curved uprights of the basket on wood slat Westy roofracks.  I need to replace 2-3 of them on a sloped roofrack, and I was wondering if anyone had some spares lying around?  I've considered going the repop PIP route, but I haven't heard many good things about PIP racks or their components.

Cash or parts to trade.  Thanks in advance.

Robert
