Hi Cal,
If the generator gets hot enough it can wipe out the grease in the generator 
bearings, and can cause the insulation of the windings of the field coils or 
armature to fail.  Even when early VWs and Porsches used a metal band like 
cover for the brush openings there were louvers to vent there.   Eric&Barb
