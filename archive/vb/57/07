The offical date I have been waiting for that. Next to BBB VI and Jerome,
BYOB is the #   #. Count me in again, first to arrive, 63rd to leave.

And here I thought patina was one of those miniature 
accordions.  LOL  David, you made a pretty wicked score, man.  I've seen 
pics of the tippers on the web and it's definitely a rare bird.  If you 
ever consider coming down to NorCal for the Kelley Park Weekend in April, 
I'd love to see the tipper out at Bring Your Own Bus on 4/6/02!!
