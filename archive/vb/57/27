Hi Don,
If it is cold out and the engine does not have the thermostatic flaps system 
the engine will not achieve proper engine temp range of at least 160F.  Also 
did you blueprint the lower pulley to make sure you are adjusting valves at 
proper placement?  Did you press a finger on the lower knurled side of each 
rocker arm to remove any looseness of the valve train whilst adjusting the 
valves?  There is a possibility that the loose valve might have a broken or 
bent pushrod.  BTDT!  Take off rockers and inspect all!
