My '65 Single Cab had alot of "Patina" when I first got it too! Alot of
elbow grease and alot of time and mst of it was gone. Looking back I
wish I would have left it alone, other have commented the same. Oh
well....... I can't change that now.

On another note, there are a couple Single Cabs for sale up here (Nor
Cal) that I passed on because they were pretty rough. One of them was
missing the side gates and had a bunch of holes in the bed and belly
area. Looking at the pictures of your Tipper I'm starting to
wonder......................
I may go back and take pictures this weekend and post them to "the
sites" to get others opinions.

Great score David!!
