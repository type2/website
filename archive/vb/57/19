Subject: 1968 Brake question. 1966 Split front floors needed

I have located a fairly early 1968 Westy that the owner claims to have 8
wheel cyls on the recently done brake system. Is this a year specific
item? Or are they mistaken? Has anyone seen front brakes modified for
the rear (doubt this since they claim to have ebrakes too) I am checking
the bus out personally soon. Yet another project, I must be crazy. Is
there a VIN decoder for bays? I know the first three digit part, last
ones are number, but can I info FROM that number?
Also, did westy always put a plate on the outside of baywindows with the
build number on the dogleg on pass side?
Sorry for the Bay window content...
Split window content...Missing my winter stored split already. Does any
one have or know of access to REAL 1966 front floors? I want correct
ribbing when the front floors are replaced, seeking desert donor metal,
or correct repops.
