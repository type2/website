But what about the guy with a 79 bus that's registered but runs poorly because there's a fuel injection problem or engine needs a top end rebuild.  Poor guy doesn't know much about working on cars so he goes to his mechanic who tells him it could cost one to two grand to get it running.  Says heck with this and takes it to the crusher and gets $500 to $1000. Not much incentive here to seek out some bus fan and sell it to him for $400.

One less bus on the road.  One bus that never made it to the Pick and Pull.

Personally, I, as a taxpayer, don't care to pay people to junk their cars.  But this isn't a LIST topic.
