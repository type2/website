Subject: Free 15in VW 5 lug wheels with sh1tty snow tires.

I just got wide 5 15" rims, the ones with the slots on the edges? They
are narrow, and have snows on em from like 1975, I wouldn't use them
(the tires) Rims look good, white paint around edges is even still
there. Def not show or restored in any way, but not crusty and beyond
effort. No sign of hubcap clips or trim rings.
Free to anyone coming through Eastern PA that wants em, just email to
make pick up arrangments.
