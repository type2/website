Subject: Bus Depot Order Follow-Up

I had posted here some time back (mid-Nov) about not getting an order from
Bus Depot.  Folks were right, I emailed Ron with the info and the order
problem was fixed.

Here's where the next problem goes;  I took folks advice about calling (long
distance) to check availability of parts that I needed soon.  Young man on
the phone was polite and informed me (8 Nov) that the Jackpoint I needed was
available for shipping.  So great, I missed ordering it with my other order
the night before to get the discount, so I'd make sure I got it.  Well,
today I thinking "it was available" it should be here by now.  Guess what,
the order was cancelled and I WAS NOT CONTACTED.  What's frustrating, I had
needed some other parts and was told on the 8th they were not available, so
I ordered them elsewhere.  I could have ordered the Jackpoint also and been
able to work on it over the Holiday break.

So it seems calling to check availability doesn't work.  I am not trying to
slam Ron's business in any way.  The seals I ordered on the 7th, with the
list discount shipped within a week.  I would just have to believe if an
order is cancelled someone would email the customer, or call, so they can
get the part elsewhere.
