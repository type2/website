Subject: listees in OK/TX 

hey everyone,
this more goes out to people in OK or TX planning on
attending BBB VI, but any OK/TX listee would be of
great help. here's the deal. i am planning on driving
down to BBB this year from Minnesota. we are planning
on stopping for the night somewhere between Oklahoma
City and Amarillo. would there be any listee willing
to let us camp out in their driveway for the evening?
it would be great if you were going to BBB so we could
caravan the rest of the way and maybe meet up with
some Phoenix listees. OK City puts us at about 13
hours of driving for the day so anything 3 or 4 hours
west of there would be great. 

TIA,
casey
