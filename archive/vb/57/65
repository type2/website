Ron is correct in that I messed up on the dates.  It was Dec and not Nov.  I
want to make sure everyone understands that the order placed on the 7th was
completed and shipped in good time for a company.  The order I problems with
before was corrected and an expectable apology was made.  The other item was
more then likely a cross in numbers since there was no message on my machine
and I was home that evening.
