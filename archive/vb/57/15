Subject: Back to hitches again

Hey,
I have one of those aftermarket tow hitches that has large U-bolts around
the torsion bar and two bolts in the bumper, that's the entire mounting.
Anyone heard of these and if I should bother to put it on. My total trailer
requirement would be a small utility trailer with 150lb or less tongue
weight. I have pics.
