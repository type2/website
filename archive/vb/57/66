An order I placed during the listee discount day arrived on time and had =
everything I needed to=20
replace the canvas and seals on a '79 Westy.=20

Only problem is that they filled my order instead of reading Karl's =
(aufever) mind on the intricacies of
late Bay Westy pop-top seals. All things considered, I'm glad Ron and crew =
are in business supplying us.=20
No complaints from this happy camper.=20
