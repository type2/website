     Actually slapping the glass is a very common practice.  It's folks that 
don't center their glass that have problems.  The unentered glass will look 
fine, come back later and you have a nice big stress crack.  Maybe I should 
make it a little clearer.  You do not hit the glass with your fist or use any 
inward force.  You slap with an open hand either in a downward or sideways 
motion.  I've been installing VW glass on and off for the past 30 years with 
great results.  In fact did a Bay Window windshield last week for a friend.  
He is very happy!
