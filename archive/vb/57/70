so I sat around for two weeks waiting to see if this
bus was going to work out (for those of you who
remember) and if I would be able to pull off bringing
it home affordably after receiving it for free from
the local authorities. As I heard was possible and as
i feared, the other guy won...but at least it ended up
in appreciative hands!....?.... I'm back in Maryland
now and not too bitter. If anyone knows of anything in
the area for me, do tell...
    Also, someone (forgive me for forgetting who)
mentioned a friend in Belgium who would possibly be
interested if I turned out not to be...well, this bus
is gone unfortunately...but there is a '74 british
camper conversion in fair to good shape sitting in the
same "up fo grabs" predicament in Florence...you'll
have to do searching on your own as I know nothing,
but anyway, there you are (maybe I'll post at the Bay
window list?)
    Okay, I'm gone. Thanks, jd wilson III
