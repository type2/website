Subject: Re: [VB] Fwd: Old Car Scrappage Alert


I just did a quick read of this bill  # S.1766, and it seems that it only
applys to turning in vehicles that are registered and operational, not
salvage yard units. Maybe I'm not seeing something, but here is part of
the bill:

(c) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA- The Secretary shall approve a State plan and
provide the funds under
     subsection (d), if the State plan--

          (1) requires that all passenger automobiles and light-duty
trucks turned in be scrapped;

          (2) requires that all passenger automobiles and light-duty
trucks turned in be currently registered in the
          State in order to be eligible;

          (3) requires that all passenger automobiles and light-duty
trucks turned in be operational at the time
          that they are turned in;


Any comments?
