I actually considered making my own dump conversion.  It wouldn't be much...
it just wouldn't be original!  I  declined the option of getting the 66
tipper that Bob also has because the pump wasn't like the ones you see in
the brochures...  damn my obsessive mind :-)

The hydraulic cylinder is actually manually operated by a hand lever that
you stick through the side of the cargo door.

reinforced box, cut a hole, find two long appreciate hinges, mount the
gates, buy the ram....make the pump electric and remotely operated.
