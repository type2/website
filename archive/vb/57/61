Subject: RE: [VB] 1966 bus preheat system?

I am referring then to part A56, seen in action on scan 195. Where does
this metal tube go? Does it just pick up air coming from past the heads,
and that is it?
Is there anything but the weight to worry about in the aircleaner?

exhanger?

Hi AL,
Go to vintagebus.com, check out the 1958-67 bus part manual in Obsolete
Air-Cooled Documents.  Go to page 143 and take a gander at part figure
