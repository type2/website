Hi Joel,
During 1963 model year.  Used upper gear for 1964-67.  Used one year RGB with 
1955-63 bearings.  Lower stub axle was one year only with 1964-67 gear and 
smaller splines and axle nut for 1955-63.  Brake drum was as wide and big of 
dia. as 1964-67 but had small 1955-63 splines.  The backing brake plate, 
brake shoes and hydralics were 1964-67 type.  Eric&Barb
