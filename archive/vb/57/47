 hi. this is a follow-up to a previous posting about converting a bus wiper
 motor to 12V, using an armature out of a 67-69 bug wiper motor.
 today i was putting one together for my 59 westy, and took apart a 68-69
 bug motor for its armature. it is too short!, about 7mm too short.
 i could swear i have used the 68-69 motors before. maybe it's a 69 thing.
 maybe it's not. i don't know for sure right now.
 tomorrow i'm gonna try to find my donor 67 motor and compare. maybe it's
 only possible to use armatures out of 67 bug motors.

When the wiper on my 69 bug went about 8 years ago I went to a VW pull a part 
place and they wanted $85 for a 69 bug wiper motor 'cause all the bus guys 
want them to make the bus motors 12V' or some such line. If I wanted to spend 
that much money I would have gone to VW!  I got one elsewhere for $20, they 
pulled it.   Might only work for the 65 bus or 66 bus wiper motors, never 
tried it.
