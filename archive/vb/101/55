Hi Charles,
Best to balance your engine, install a CW crank and keep the RPMs down at 
highway speeds by 4.125 or freeway flier tranny.  We did this with our 1960 
walk thru panel camper conversion and it made a huge differance.  As for 
insulation it would be nice to try some sound deadener over the engine 
compartment, but for us now heat/cold is more important problem.  We have 
found a VW Tech Bullitian that shows how to thermally insulate a panel van 
with styrofoam panels you can buy at hardware stores.  Also shows how to make 
ceiling and wall panels to cover the insulation.  We will try it sometime, 
but only after lightly tarring all the interior panels to be 
insulated/covered to prevent any rust problems.  Right now still fighting 
down the roof rust due to indoor/outdoor carpet that was glued in by DPO!
