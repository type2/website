 My truck's vin says its production date is Jan '63 but the shoes that fit
 are for trucks after like july '63, or so the shop says.  The front end
 looks like it has grease built up on it since '63 so I would says its
 original.  What's the story on these brakes?

if your truck came with the 1 ton option (M 215 i think for 63) or someone 
later put on a 1 ton front end you use the shoes for 1 tons (usually 64-67)

you may also have the 1 ton rear axles, in which case the rear shoes are the 
1 tons even though the axle nut is 36mm.
