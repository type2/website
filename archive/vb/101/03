Subject: RE: [VB] Air Cleaner Question

Uh Oh, better take that back. I use the double snout oil bath bug type on my
type 2's for years. My 71 westy had one, my 65 DC had one, and now I have
one on my current T2, my 67 SC. I don't remember why I have so many of these
things (could be all the engines I build), but they sure are convenient and
fit the 30/31 and 34 PICT carbs. The only reason I have one on my 67 SC
right now is that my battery slid forward and shorted against the stock air
cleaner and arced a hole through it draing the oil in it all over the inside
of the battery tray area on on the ground.

By all means use the oil bath, but you'll need the  bus style - the bug
one won't work.
