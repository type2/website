I use custom cut 1/2" 2LB polyureothane insulation and glue them to the
outer skin through the access holes inside. Seems to work good, but I like
the pic of that firewall floormat material shown. That ought to really do
the job!

Anyone have suggestions on "insulation" for sound deadening?  Is it worth
doing?  This was on a singlecab at Jerome last year.they claim that the
singlecab is so quiet that they cannot hear the engine running.
