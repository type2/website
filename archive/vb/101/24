Subject: Re: [VB] Original, what does it mean?

Original= the way it came from the factory without any modifications to that
basic vehicle
Accessories= parts that you have added on to that original vehicle to
enhance it.
NOS= Original VW parts that are old and have not been used yet in or out of
the box.
Restored= your call.

Just my interp.
