A good alternative to Soda blasting (Sodium Bicarbonate) is Calcium
Carbonate (fine, powdered Marble). I'm lucky, because working in the
oilfield, I can get both easily, but it may be harder for you northerners.
I would try the local CO-OP or grain mill.  Some people use Bicarb to lower
the pH in soil/water, etc (maybe even a pool place).  The calcium carbonate
you could probably get cheap from a marble place that 'casts' custom marble
stuff.  They basically glue/epoxy calcium carbonate together to make stuff.

I know this isn't the best descriptions, but if you live in/around Louisiana
(the real LA) email me, I'll tell you where to get some.

Later
Charles
