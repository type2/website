Subject: Removing oxidation on Pot metal

Need some help.


I just received a NOS set of SWF safari window wiper
shaft pivots.  The smaller ones that are repro'd right
now out of aluminum.  These have some sort of
oxidation on them from sitting.  Nothing bad, but i
really do not want to bead blast or sand it off.  Are
there any chemicals out there that would restore the
metal.  (I know it may leave some pitting behind)

Any ideas?

Thanks
Matthew
