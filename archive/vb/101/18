The Nor Cal Vintage Weekend

Because there is *alot* more going on then just these 2 events. The
poker run Friday, the raffle Friday, *many* shops are having "open
house" type things, the BBQ at Volks Authority, not to mention the
hanging / camping with friends Friday night, the dinner
Saturday............
