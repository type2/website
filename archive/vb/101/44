Subject:  [VB] Glueing Insulation

How bad is glueing insulation to the skin of our VW's?  Will that lock in
moisture?  Is it better to tape it in place?  What was the factory option?

ya- except he tells you to use spray foam- which is obviously a sign of

possessed by a demon- as spray foam encourages rust.

I get road noise- adding a front floor mat and pedal splash pan helps.
a 
seconf floor mat may help more.   Good heat tubes and heat on adds
engine 
noise.    So you may want to leave your heat off
