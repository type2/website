> 3rd,   Any site designer has the ability to keep a viewer from copying an
image. There is a right click disabler that makes the viewer unable to copy

I have the ability to prevent my Bus from being stolen by locking the doors
every night, that doesn't mean if I leave them unlocked, you have the right
to steal it.

If the image displays on your web site, I can capture it via numerous
methods, right-clicking is just the easiest.
