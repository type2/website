Subject:  RE: [VB] Grrr,  Westfakia!

For $5500 I would be upset if it wern't the real deal.
 There was a young lady selling a 70 Hardtop Westy at
thesamba.com a month or so ago that I looked at... it
was an obivous convertion.  What I saw on this
particular bus was dark colored woodgrain, found in 72
and later Westies.
While I might buy a Westfakia bay bus, I want to be
sure of what I am sinking my money into with a split.
Looking at this 64, I would assume that it was, but
wonder why it has non-cranking windows.  If you look
at the open cargo door you can see that the glass is
solid... a pop-out window!  I don't know if there were
ever any Westies with popouts... or when they started
the crankouts.
Just an observation... nothing more.
Thanks for posting the bus.
-Dawn
