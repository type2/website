Subject: RE: [VB] Bed slat screws

   The reason I asked is that according to the picture (thanks David),
somebody had removed every screw and put a rubber grommet under the screws
then reinstaled them, I guess to keep water out, well it didn'r work, this
was 1 rusty bus

   Does anybody out there have a picture of what the bed slat screws look
like on an early single/double cab, I went out to the single cab bed (56) I
have and it is full of screws.
