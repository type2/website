I know exactly how you feel, just ask Wade. When he
unveiled his website and said that all the photos on
it were new and never before seen, I had a prob with
that. Cause I saw some photos that I had taken and
knew that I didn't send in to Wade. Come to find out
that I couldn't even find where on thesamba, or
vintagebus where my images were. Ends up being that I
sent out some pictures to friends for there amusement
or whatever and then someone else contributed it to
Wade's site. I was peaved I guess, but after all and
all, it is no big deal now. It is nice to know that
people think you have good images, maybe in the future
do like they do on ebay and stamp your name across it
in paintshop or something. By the way, check out the
bus page at cyberdorks, almost all the images there
are borrowed.
