Subject: Re: [VB] Original, what does it mean?

I'm the guy who started the discussion on the meaning of the word "original"
as it is applied to a particular vehicle. I noticed it on an ad for a very
nice double cab when the advertiser headlined his ad with the word
"ORIGINAL!!! 1964 CREW" on The Samba.com then went on to describe the truck
as having been restored eight years ago.
As a former antique dealer and collector, when something has been restored
it is no longer eligible to be classified as original. I believe that an
item that has been "reconditioned" "restored" or modified beyond replacement
of normal wear and tear items such as tires, brake shoes, hoses, filters and
such should be regarded as no longer being original. My 1966 Westy, which is
rusty, and in need of several repairs is nonetheless "original." My friend's
1963 Westy, which has been carefully and skillfully restored back to
"like-new" condition is not "original."
The truck which Mr. Knight is offering for sale is very desirable and very
likely worth the $15,000 he is asking, however, from his own description, it
is not "original." (But I'd sure like to have it!!)
