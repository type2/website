Subject: Re: [VB] Halogen light conversion????

The cheapo H4's sell for about $10 each. They work very well at night. They
replace a sealed beam headlamp almost perfectly except......They are thinner
at the section where they sit in the base and the ring rests on to hold them
down. You tighten the hold down screws and they seat the ring but the H4 light
still moves around. The sealed beam cross section is about 6mm thick. The H4
is about 3mm. I have to stick a large o-ring between the light and the ring to
get it tight. [by large, I mean a 7-8" o-ring for an automatic transmission
clutch pack]
