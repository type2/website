Subject: soda blastin and...

hi list

Is soda blasting an easy to do for the home blaster??  i know its easy to go
to the local auto part and buy blasting glass media, but what if i ask about
Soda??  Last time i went to this auto part, i asked about powdercoating and
flexible stainles steel fuel line and he looked at me like i was an alien!!
Why, he never saw a mustang whith chrome all around flexible fuel line? ok
for powdercoating ...at least ive found a business to powdercoat my engine
cooling tin for... 25 $ (but it cost me 90$ to sandblast them) and they look
awesome.

Now if i want to buy soda media blasting, im sure they never heard about
that,can i use cow brand soda?
 hahaha maybe i could find CowBrand at club price in quantities for cheap!

thx

mike
