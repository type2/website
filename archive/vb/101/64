Subject: repop bumper brackets all bad?

Hullo, list.

I recently picked up a pair of new rear bumper brackets from a guy who was 
selling them on thesamba for cheap (told they were Brazilian) for my '65.  It 
seems like the flange that bolts up to the bumper has insufficient angle 
because my bumper tips down now a fair bit (which it did not do prior).

Is this a common problem with all repop rear brackets or are other sources 
satisfactory?  Should I just try to find some good originals?

What does repop stand for, anyways?

TIA
