It does have the sub-hatch and some form of rear cabinets, but everything
else screams passenger bus.

I am not familiar with this bus personally so who knows its life story...
But in its present form I feel that it is a stretch to call it a Westi.

The rant is actually a generalization from what I have been seeing
advertised lately.  I have nothing for or against the example bus.

...you'll have to explain this one to me.  What exactly about this
submarine hatch Westy isnt a Westy?  True enough it doesnt have any real
views of the camper interior...but judging from the roof and the view in
the rear hatch of the cabinets, I'd at least assume it has westy parts on
it...

Or do you know something more about this particular bus that we dont, that
isnt explained in the ad?
