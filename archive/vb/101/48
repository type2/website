Nah.  an H4 bulb has a three prong plug and has both high and low beam.
If it's advertised as an H4, you're fine.

The Hella lights (NOT the VisionPlus stuff..) are great....but cheap H4
globes are STILL better then a regular sealed beam bulb.  Typically the
low beam pattern SUCKS (relative to good (bosch, cibe, hella..) lights)
but the high beams are pretty decent.  YMMV.
