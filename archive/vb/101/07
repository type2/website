You mean they put other things in a T-2 besides dual ports? heh he, sorry.

No, I don't have any clearance problem, in fact the two bed beams are 6 to 8
inches away from the slightly down pointing snouts  and my little hot air
hose, although extended now, plugs right in.

Really?  The stock one barely fits on my '60.  How do you get the carb
low enough for the clearance of the air cleaner, or is this a dual-port
thing?  (I've never had a dual-port engine)
