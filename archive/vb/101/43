No way:)  I carefully opened up the hole by hand using the drill in the tap
wrench first.  It's not that hard really:)  It was almost pleasurable in a
sick and twisted sort of way;)  BTW, the drill and counter bore tools fit my
T-handle tap wrench but the actual tap was a little too big so I used an
adjustable wrench to turn it while maintaining correct alignment.  I also
used some WD40 on the tap but oil on the installation tool.

Big guess- You just used the tap wrench, because the 8M hole was
already loose, and the tap was a 9M. Correct ?
