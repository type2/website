Subject: on the road again

We are headed north on our way to BYOB and Kelley Park.  Unfortunately
the SC has another brake problem, leaking wheel cylinder, so we are back
to the old reliable, the 59 double door EZ camper.  So everyone should
recognize us down the road.  We are headed over Tehachapi and north on
99 to Madera today, then on into the SF bay area tomorrow.  See you
Friday afternoon at the Big Red Barn.

P & C
ready for this cruisin camp out   Wave if you see us.
