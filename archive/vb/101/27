Doesn't help at all Rob,
When I got my DC, I found that the "tool area" under the front bench seat came
complete with a squirrel's nest and a winter's supply of walnuts.  Not to
mention all the opened shells.  One thing I was thankful for is that the
squirrel was a clean bugger, didn't poop or pee in the same area that it slept
and ate. (whew!).

Also, with the soda, mix in a little vinegar and then stand back and watch the
fun!
