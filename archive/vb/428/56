On my radio, the LED is on all the time, and the LED back-light comes
on when the key is on.

Right, but on newer cars when you turn the key off, the headlights go
off and only the running lights stay on - precisely as a protection
against forgetting and coming back from shopping to find a dead
battery.

I would think this feature was heavily driven by complaints from
parents whose kids partied at the park or beach with the car shut off
and then the car wouldn't start afterwards.

If you search Napa for battery switch, you get 24 results. Mine looks
like this one with the red keys. I just leave the key in all the time
unless I want to take it out for security.
