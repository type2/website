Beginning in the 1971 model year, the Ignition Switch and Light Switch
were redesigned to accomplish turn the headlights off when the
Ignition Switch was turned off (or in Start mode).  There is a "X"
Terminal on the Ignition Switch in which a 14 gauge Black w/Yellow
Striped wire connected to the "X" Terminal on the Light Switch,
powering the Headlights ONLY.  The rest of the lights are powered the
older conventional way with the "hot" Red wire going to Terminal 30 on
the Light Switch.  It's been like that on VWs ever since (and on a lot
of other makes as well).

The relay method that John Anderson describes is very do-able to mimic
this same action.
