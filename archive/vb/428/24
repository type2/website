Which beggs the obvious question to the OP.  Why don't you add a headlight
relay?  Will solve your problem, though you'd need to find a switched current
source.  I'd rewire your headlight switch to a switched power source feeding
the relay coil, then the original unswitched high current source off the
switch to the switched contacts of the relay and then to the lamps.  Or even
better run a high current supply (fused) from the battery to the relay for the
actual supply to the lamps as that is always a fine idea in an aged VW for
incandescent or halogen lamps.  Now if you want to get super fancy of course,
as I've mentioned many times (and I didn't follow the originial year) but I
would always run a set of HIDs at the same time, negating the need of the new
front to rear high current run, but being in CA and all the chances are
probably slimmer of getting away with it, yeah, umm, err, like all those
Hondas getting pulled over an all.  Won't engage
 again in an arguement pro and con, lots of the con speak from what they
read, but once you see the light from the Bosch 0 301 600 118 running a cheapo
35W HID you'll never ever go back unless "the man" makes you.
 
Anyway multitude of thoughts and possibilities here.  One $2 relay and
possibly changing a few spade connectors and 10-15 minutes would likely solve
the main complaint and put off the lamps with the switch.

The running lights stayed on, but headlights went off.   They must have
changed the wiring. by '73.  Maybe they added a headlight relay.
