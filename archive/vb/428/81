Hi John,

If your motor is a 1915cc, which by the compression numbers would lead  
me to believe that is correct, what carb(s) are you running??

If you are still running a stock single 34pict-3, then therein lies  
the problem.  It sounds like it is WAY too lean which will cause the  
bucking, popping and a general lack of power under any load.  I would  
bet that carb is still running the stock jetting which will be WAY too  
lean for a 1915 at almost any RPM.  Time to check the jetting and  
fatten it up or better yet, dump the POS 34pict-3 and do the right  
thing by sticking a pair of 40 IDFs on it and drive happy.  Good Luck!!
