I've been contemplating the Retrosound unit and have heard this before,
although I've also heard it should take awhile (many months) to kill a good
battery.  My question is - how is this different from any other radio with
memory?  Is the retro unit just consuming more while "off" than other radios? 
I had a pioneer in a bus (80's/90's) that always drew power for the memory and
I can't remember it ever being an issue (even when the bus sat) and I haven't
read about it as an issue with more modern units.
Thanks
