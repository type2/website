I bought an AWFULLY GOOD boom box on amazon.com and disfigured it 
with paint nicely to make it less desirable to steal and it is 
battery powered when it is not plugged in. I also keep a filthy 
lookin' rag in the bus and throw it over the boom box when i leave 
the bus, which is highly alarmed anyway but why not minimize temptation?

and this solved the whole issue. it is a small boom box and delivers 
remarkably fine sound. (I am an audiophile and have ancient equipment 
and recordings, so I really CARE about what things sound like).
If this interests you I will go and look and see what exactly I 
bought, after consulting other audiophiles as regards portable music.
