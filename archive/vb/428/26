Unplug the grey/black door contact switch wire from the T connector
under the dash, and connect it to the ground side of the buzzer.
Connect a red wire from the taillight fuse to the hot side of the
buzzer.

Now your buzzer will go off if you open the door while your headlight
(&taillight) is on.

You might as well connect the dangling other side of that T connector
(ignition SU) from above to the #85 pin of a relay for a stereo. Now
your stereo works only when a key is in the ignition.
