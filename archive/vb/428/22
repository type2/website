Subject: Re: Duh(-at-)! Flat Battery

I have done a similar thing leaving my lights on. A job I was working on
last year, I had to drive through a tunnel each morning to work, so I'd turn
the lights on going into the tunnel, but never think to turn them off  when
coming out. 

 

I'd say about 10 times I had my client, their neighbor, or one of my
co-workers tell me I left my lights on.  Thanks to them

 

I don't understand why the lights work when the vw is turned off. I know
most cars work like that, is there an electrical reason?

 

When my battery died last year, I bought one of those  jump-start things at
the nearest Sears which I could walk to. The guy behind the counter said it
did not come charged, but it actually had  enough juice to get my truck
going, then I went to the FLAPS where I exchanged my battery, which was
still in warranty.
