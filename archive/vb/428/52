Hi Eric & Barb,

 

Thanks E&B. I got it set, but I think the numbering you suggested is
backwards.well on the fuse box label reading from left to right, you get
8,7,6.so I actually hooked the accessory lead for the radio up to fuse #2.

 

It seems my options with this thing is to leave it hot all the time-which
leaves the display on showing the clock all the time. This way I can listen
to my radio when the bus is off. I like the idea of listening to the radio
when the bus is off, not so keen on the clock being on all the time.

Alternatively I follow E&B advice, hook it up the correct way, then the
radio only works when the bus is on, and the clock only displays when the
bus is on as well. I guess the radio is still drawing a little power for
memory, but probably a lot less than if the clock was also displayed.

I guess I wonder how much battery drain is there with the clock on. I
imagine it can't be much-as most modern cars have something similar, don't
they?

I may switch it back to powered up all  the time.

I'll live with it as is for a while, and see if I want to switch it back.

I guess I was hoping to listen to the radio with the bus off for a few
reasons, one of which is the fact that the radio comes with a RF remote
control. I was imagining myself lying in bed, listening to the radio, while
reading or something. Then turning the radio off when I want to go to sleep.
