Subject: Re: [VB] RARE Type IIs

 Would say none of those are rare.
   Rare would be something like:

Cherry picker truck

Rail road inspection bus

Traffic radar bus

LHD Westie with LH cargo doors and so interior is RHD setup

Kombi with factory sunroof

Any non-ambulance with factory installed glass partition


Westie with originally installed Dormobile top

Wide bed single cab.

E&B
