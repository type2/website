Thanks for all the suggestions, definitely has my mind going thinking of
different options.

 

One I just noticed is this one : http://www.retrosoundusa.com/

Has anyone tried these yet? Looks pretty good and basic, yet with all the
features I think I could want. I have a modern radio in my '69, and it looks
like a modern radio-kind of funny looking in an old vw. This retro one seems
as close to vintage looking as you can get. I just wonder if it really fits
my bus.

 

I like the idea of a basic looking radio fitting in the original radio slot,
but having some modern features. I figure if it looks basic enough it will
be left alone.

 

I love the idea of the old radios being tweaked to run modern plug-ins, I
just can't see the cost associated with them. Ie they look great, but how
reliable is an old one.even if it has been tweaked. I just have two old
radios, and both had the same problem-the power/volume know broke on them.
They are also both 6V, without a switch to convert them to 12V on the back.
