Sure. Sounds interesting. I had picked up a JBL on Tour which has
great quality in a small package, but is somewhat lacking in volume
when outside the bus. Disappointingly it just failed the other week. I
expected more durability in a high priced item, but I suspect ants may
have helped. I need to open it for an autopsy, but I lack the torx
size, or whatever the special screws are that they used on it.
