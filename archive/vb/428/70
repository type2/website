I just looked up the 3M Schutz product, that looks like a rubberized
undercoating type product. I don't think I like the idea of a rubberized
coating. Maybe I'll try the bar and chain oil, I've heard recommended on the
list. Although I think that was for the undercarriage, not for rocker panel
(ie hidden)locations.

Hi Kevin,
If one sprayed WD-40 in there every day that might help.
   Worked in the on an only USAF machine shop that had a single head tracer
milling machine.  The sergeant in charge of that side of the shop insisted
on WD-40 to be sprayed onto the table of the machine each Friday.  Problem
is WD-40 is a very thin light weight oil made for getting into really tight
places, so it tends to evaporate quickly.  Result was the steel table of
this machine would often lightly rust in spots over the weekend in an air
conditioned shop in central Texas.  
   While the lathes and drill presses never would do to using a heavier oil
on them!!
  3M does sell a interior panel spray called "3M rocker Schutz.  Would water
spray out the panels and wait for a few dry Summer days to pass before
applying.
  Have heard of good results from East coaster with chain saw oil, to keep
salt rust away.
