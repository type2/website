Subject: Late split dogleg drain location?

Hi All,

I was washing the bus this afternoon and noticed standing water inside
the upper (seat height) drain hole of one of the doglegs.  This is a
'66, so the upper drain empties into a triangular-shaped pocket behind
the front wheel, but I didn't find any obvious drain holes in the
triangular piece.  How are they supposed to drain to the ground?

Thanks,
Tristan
