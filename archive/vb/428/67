AFAIK no real drain hole, just drains through the seams.  Though it is
connected to the forward part of the dogleg.
Good idea to wash these out from time to time.

Dust gets in dogleg,
stays damp, rusting from inside.
Wash the hidden place.

 Use a pressure washer or even just a garden hose.   Watch the dirt come out.

Hi All,
I was washing the bus this afternoon and noticed standing water inside
he upper (seat height) drain hole of one of the doglegs.  This is a
66, so the upper drain empties into a triangular-shaped pocket behind
he front wheel, but I didn't find any obvious drain holes in the
riangular piece.  How are they supposed to drain to the ground?
Thanks,
ristan
