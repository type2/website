Subject: RE: Re: [VB] wiper switch not turning off

Hey John,

Yeah I have tried that armature swap-and it was not compatible with my
motor-even though the seller assured me it was. I still have it, I guess if
I get another wiper motor from a different year I might be able to make it a
12V motor.

Sounds like the solution is a voltage drop-or wiper motor swap.

Thanks for the explanation...my wife thought it was quite funny with me
trying everything to turn the damn thing off, and my inability to even pull
the wires from behind the switch...

If you open up the motor, you'll see that there's a set of points opened
by a cam that provides power to the motor after you turn the switch off.
When the cam opens the points, the motor stops in the parked position.
If your motor is running faster than it was designed to run because it's
getting 12 volts instead of 6, it's probably coasting past the place
where it's supposed to park, which lets the points close and feed the
motor power again, which means the motor has to do another cycle of the
wipers to try again.

While you're in there looking at all that, you can put in a 12 volt
armature and then it will work right when you put it back together. 8^)
