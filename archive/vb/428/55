Subject: re:Music in your bus

Hi John et al.

Sorry I was not clear, powering both the accessory lead on the radio and the
main power lead all the time, leaves the clock on-so the battery draw is for
the LED and the memory.

If I just power the accessory lead all the time-this keeps the time in
memory, but display off. It also saves your station presets or any other
variables you set. So the draw is less.

I guess as you suggest-if I drive my bus frequently enough, having the LED
clock on all the time should not hurt the battery, and then I can listen to
the bus while parked. My battery is fairly new, and I generally travel with
a jumper battery-pak thing. So I guess I should not worry about killing the
battery

As far as the radio being designed to shut off when the car is off-I kind of
understand the logic from the engineers, but if you really think about it,
it does not make sense. Almost all cars(our buses included) you can leave
your headlights on. Thinking through the process of turning your headlights
on (usually when dark) and leaving them on by mistake(usually when light
out) this should be more of a priority as far as a circuit to be killed when
you shut your car off. As for your radio- you turn it on when you get in the
car and turn your car on, then when you turn your car off, the car gets
quieter, you will perceive your radio volume as higher, and it is it's own
built in notification system, that works whether it is dark or bright out. 

 

I have thought about getting one of those battery shut off switches. Is
there a particular one you recommend?
