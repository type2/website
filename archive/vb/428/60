Just curious, do we have a confirmation that this is a REAL thing and valid request for financial help??  All the web scams and Nigerian King emails have made me a suspicious, non-trusting dude.
I'd be glad to kick in a few bucks if we were absolutely sure it was legit.

Also, what happens if you pledge and then they don't reach their goal??? Are we still "on the hook" for the pledge in that situation???
