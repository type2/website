Subject: Re: [T2] RE: THE BUS - fundraising program

Kickstarter approves all of the projects that are on the site, or at least
they take down non-legit ones, and they have very specific rules as to how
fundraising is organized.

They are given up to 90 days (number of days of their own choosing) and if
they don't meet their $25,000 goal, then the money is refunded to the donor
and they have to start all over again.
