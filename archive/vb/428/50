Just up from Greg and Carla about 30 miles their is another Westfalia wooden
wide bed SC, it is a 66 I belive. I see it all the time, either driving around
or parked at his work. I am sure I posted photos on either VB or TS
Also here in Tacoma their is a 61 23 window deluxe with sunroof delete option.
Seems it cost an additional $200 to not have the sunroof.
