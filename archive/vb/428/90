Subject: The "Barn Find" myth...

Here's an interesting story about the mythical "barn find".  No VW's, but there is a part about an old Porsche 356 Speedster which is close enough to a VW for us, right?!?!

PEACE!

"...So we got in the red VW microbus with the
shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on toward the
police officer's station..."
