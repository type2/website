I have a good friend who makes and sells these stereos:

http://leftcoast.biz/iWeb/Left_Coast/Simple_stereo.html

They were designed for use in his sail boats, but they lend themselves
PERFECTLY for use in classic cars.  These are basically an amp for
your iPod or other MP3 device.  You control the volume through your
iPod and since most devices have FM radio tuners, you have that as
well.  Plug in a pair of speakers and you have music.  It only draws
about 1.5 amps of power at full volume (which is REALLY loud).  This
was designed very efficiently so it makes almost no heat.  It's cast
in a hard black resin so it's water proof, vibration proof and
virtually idiot proof as evidenced by my installing one in my Porsche
914 with success.  An added feature is that is also has a USB port so
you can charge your iPod or anything else that gets charged on your
computer (cameras, cell phones etc.) as you drive.  It's about the
size of a pack of cigs and can be mounted anywhere.  Just mount the
face plate where it's convenient for you.

100% American made (how often can you find that these days??)  Just
wanted you all to know there is an alternative to traditional stereos
out there. . .
