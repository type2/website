Subject: Re: [VB] wiper switch not turning off

Hey Kevin,

I would take a look at the switch. It may be possible to disassemble and 
clean. May involve drilling out a rivet or two. You can replace with a small 
screw when you put it back together.

Someone else may have done this. Hope we here from them.

Regards,
Chris
