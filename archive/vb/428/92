Subject: wiper switch not turning off

Hi guys, trying to trouble shoot a wiper issue.

 

I converted my bus to 12V a while ago, still have the 6V wiper motor-which I
use sparingly.

 

Well for some reason when I try to turn it off-it does not want to go off. I
have tried tapping the switch, knocking the switch, turning it on and off a
bunch of times.eventually it turns off. I am trying to figure out how to
determine the problem.ie is it just the switch? Or is there something else
that could be broken(ie is there a relay of some sort in there?) and if it
is the switch, can you dismantle it like the headlight switch, and resolder
it, or is this a replacement part.

 

Thanks for any tips on troubleshooting.

 

Oh yeah, this is on my '65 ez-camper.
