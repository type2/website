I make a wide range of interior panels for split buses, and a more limited
range of interior panels for bay window buses.

For upholstery, I have bought seat covers from TMI.    They have a nice range
of seat covers and the pads that go under the new seat covers.

If you are needing seats, best thing is to get some used original seats.

What year and model is you bus?
What are you looking to get for the interior?

Where is a good place to get interior for a VW BUS?
