Subject: re:Late split dogleg drain location?

After rinsing this area out, and or the rocker panel areas out, does anyone
spray anything inside this area? I've heard of sparying oil in there, or
waxoyl, or dinitrol.etc

 

I never have, but have thought about doing something like this, but I didn't
want to spray something up there that would actually casue more damage.
Maybe just WD-40, frequently..
