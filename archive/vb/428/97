OK..so sounds like I need to install one of those voltage drops(thanks to
all for explaining what was happening).

 

I see I can mail order them, but in the interest of supporting local
business first-my local electronics store has a voltage drop that can handle
up to 2 AMPS. How many amps does it need to handle?
