The Retrosound will drain a small amount of power when connected, even if
"off". Both the yellow (for memory) and the red (main power) wires need to be
connected to 12V for the unit to work. If the yellow wire is not connected to
fulltime/battery 12V, your memory will be lost when you turn off the unit. The
red 12V can be connected to battery or ignition as it does not need power for
memory. If you drive your bus relatively often this will not be a problem.
Over the winter, maybe...DAMHIKT.
