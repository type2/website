Subject: Looking for an engine in Ohio - trades welcome

Hey, anyone got a RUNNING 1500 or 1600 engine they want to sell or swap for?  I have a bunch of bus & ghia parts, but I also have a 1970 convertible parts vehicle Ghia (way beyond saving),  it is pretty much junk except for the doors, glass, windshield and windshield frame, tranny, and locked up engine. BUT it has a clear Ohio title (in my name) and VIN plate... this must be worth something to someone.  I also have a 1978 Bus title with VIN plate from an old bus that went to the scrapper... I know people want these!

Must be relatively near Cincinnati, ohio (100-200 mile radius max)
Of course if you are a capitalist and have what I want, then there is always the option of me paying you in money ;^)

PEACE! 
John Baker
