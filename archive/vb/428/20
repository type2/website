The new law in California means that you have to turn on your headlights
when it is raining. So yesterday I drove around with my lights on in the
rain. Well when it is light you can't really tell that your lights are
on. So when I came out six hours later everything was dead.

I guess that I should have known better, but the singlecab started right
up with jumper cables from my wife's mini-van.

Modern cars beep when you leave the light on, my 87 Vanagon and 73 Thing
turn off the headlights and leave on the side lights, so:

Be Careful to turn off lights in the day when it is raining.
