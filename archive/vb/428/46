I almost bought a "barndoor" single cab in Christchurch, New Zealand.  
It was restored and it drove well when I took it for a test drive. It  
used to be parked on the street near me. The first time I saw it it  
looked different. Then I noticed that the windshield went right up to  
the roof and no over hang!   It was so cheap I cannot believe I  
didn't get it....Gary
