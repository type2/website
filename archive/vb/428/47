Subject: re:Music in your bus

Hey guys,

 

I just wanted to update this old thread.I appreciated all your suggestions,
and ideas.I think my favorite was to befriend musicians, and just drive them
around.

 

What I ended up getting was the retrosound radio. I like the look of it, my
original knobs actually fit on the control shafts. Overall I think it looks
ok, not as cool as original-but it has more than a couple extra features.
Also it did not require any dash modification.

 

One question about the wiring-it needs power two ways-one is always on, and
one is like an accessory power. I fed them both from the 'radio' spot as per
the wiring diagrams, but in retrospect I think I'd rather hook it up
separately. Which fuse would just get powered when the bus is on?

 

Sorry for my ignorance in reading wiring diagrams.
