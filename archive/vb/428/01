Subject: music in your bus?

Well, I am currently putting some polyurethane on the new ceiling panels I
made for my '65. I am trying to figure out exactly what I want for tunes in
my bus, and figure at the least I should run some wiring, before installing
these panels.

 

My original radio is 6V, AM. I switched my bus to 12V shortly before taking
it off the road for restoration. It was fun to listen to AM radio, but at
this point I want to listen to more than just AM radio.

 

My thought was to just install an amplifier, and some speakers, and
headphone type jack-so I could just plug any device with a headphone output
into it (cell phone included). Then I could run a wire from the amp to up by
the ash-tray. Then just plug the 3.5MM male plug into my  cell
phone/zone/ipod/or whatever the latest music device is. At this point I
don't have any of these, but plan on getting something in the near future. 

 

This makes more sense to me than trying to install a car radio into my dash,
or hanging off my dash.and then having it stolen(as it was from my
squareback).

 

Anyone else do something like this, and have some tips?
