Subject: THE BUS - the Movie - 3 days left to chip in some coin

I just saw this posted on the type 2 list

 

http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/busmovie/the-bus

 

Not directly vintagebus, but it is bus related, and it is Friday.

 

Come on and do your part, help make a Bus movie..

 

I know nothing more than what I just read on thekickstarter page, but it
looks like it could be fun thing to watch. I enjoyed the trailer alone.
