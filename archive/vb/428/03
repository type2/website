Hi Kevin,
Why not just get a vintage radio and hook up the outside music source.  Most
Euro radios are 6 or 12 volt switchable and have outside connection plugs for
accessories like 45 RPM record player, SW receiver adapter, cassette player,
etc....

   Running a SW/FM/AM Blaupunkt in our bus that has the accessories plug.
Have not adapted the plug in yet, but enjoy listening to Radio Cuba, out here
in the PNW.

 Here is a link for more info on these accessory plugs:
