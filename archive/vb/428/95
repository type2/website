Subject: Re: [VB] wiper switch not turning off

Hi,

I didn't think about the self stopping system as I have a 64 without. I do 
run the 6V motor on my 12V system. The motor runs cool so I never worried 
about the overvoltage. The wipers do run at a satisfying speed however. I 
live in So Cal so they are used infrequently. I have used them for extended 
periods in the distant past without problems. As you may know from previous 
posts, I converted to 12V in 1976 or so.
