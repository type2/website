The splitty has the headlight switch real close to the ignition switch.
  I am used to tapping the headlight switch off in the same motion I turn the
key to shut off the engine.
Washington has the same law about light on when you use the wipers, which
means almost every day this time of years.
hm... 18 of 25 days this month have had precipitation, and rain is in the
forecast every day for the rest of the month.

However, I've been driving my 69 beetle more than the 66 kombi recently.
The beetle headlight switch is not located near the ignition, and I have left
the lights on a couple times.   Once I came back to the car to find the engine
would not start.
However, I was able to push start it by myself  :)

Why can you leave the lights on?   Because the bus is wired so the power does
not go through the ignition switch.   Actually, the big fat red wire from the
battery goes to the headlight switch first, then to the ignition switch.

I had a '73 bus where the headlights would go off when the ignition was turned
off.
The running lights stayed on, but headlights went off.   They must have
changed the wiring. by '73.  Maybe they added a headlight relay.
