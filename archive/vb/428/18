It's not.  Exactly the same.  But they're targeting a market of folks who 
are replacing a factory radio that -didn't- do that - so they got tired of 
being yelled at about dead batteries and stuck that up. :)

Every new car on the market in the US does that, and has for years - leave 
them unattended and the battery will be dead, too.
