Subject: new crew cab!!!!

I did it!!!! I drove my 1961 crew cab home to day!!! Wow I am so excited.
The drive home was about 50 miles, threading the needle through very dark
heavy clouds and for the most part missing some serious rain. The crew cab
made the trip without incident except as I pulled in to Austin I noticed
that she wouldn't idle at all. At first I thought that it was just general
need of tuning up, new plugs and valve adjustment, etc., at least that is
what I was hoping. Well, I opened the engine compartment and low and behold
there was the idle jet just sitting there. I picked it up and put it back in
place and walah!, smooth idle again.

I plan to really give her a going over and I will post some more details
later this week. I appretiate the input I got from Steve and Stephen. Yes, I
probably paid a little too much, but hey I love this truck!!!! More later,
