Hi,

I have a 67 komi 1300cc and I saw a rebuild kit in JC Whitney for $250 that includes 87mm pistons.  Does anyone know if these kits from JC Whitney are any good? What is the brand name?  Is this a difficult job? Are there any directions for this procedure on the web?

The kit also says that no machining is required.  Is this true?

thanks for any replies

mike
