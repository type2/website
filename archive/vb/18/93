Subject: Re: [VB] steering column seal

Hi Ronnie,
  I asked the same question in the past.  I believe it was Eric&Barb that 
sent me this:
  211 415 617 Gasket
  Steering Column tube from chassis No. 20-941 712.
I am looking for one myself so if you find out where to get them please let 
me know.

Thanks,
Wayne Carlisle
