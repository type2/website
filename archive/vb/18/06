Hi Stew,
If the garage you now have is seperate from the house you should look into 
raising the garage!  At least three inches just to get it in which can be 
done by slipping two 2x4s or two 2x6s under the walls.  If it has a cinder 
block base you can really go to town and add one or two rows of 6-8" high 
cinder blocks and really get some room to pull in even with a roof rack on 
top.  Either way you will end up with a garage that you can utilize for your 
bus work and storage out of the weather without all the future fuss of 
lowering your bus to get it inside each time!   Eric&Barb
