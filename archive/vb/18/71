I dropped my poles off with a friend who is a bus nut and an 
industrial welder. He is going to repair a cracked some cracked 
brazes on the corner connectors. He was inspecting them and remarked 
that the coloring on the poles may be a cadmium plating. I will 
enquire further when I pick them up. I will let you know.

BTW, my poles do not look so great either so let me know how yours turn out.

Thanks
Chris
