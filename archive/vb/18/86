I used to use them, but I DRIVE my busses.  They sell
good insurance (stated value for reasonable prices),
but the vehicle HAS to be garaged, and there are
mileage limits without special permission.  I don't
have enough garages, and I hate to ask permission of a
huge corporation to drive my busses.  Of course, I am
insured through Allstate now, which is the WORST
company about paying valid claims.  But I hear they
have pretty good prices for stated value insurance. 
It's easy to be reasonable if you don't pay out
claims!
