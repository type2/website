Subject: steering column seal

    I have been asked many times and never had the answer to what went
around the steering column at the floor. I have never owned a bus with
anything there and all the people and Geru's I asked never had a definate
answer. Well I think I have solved it. On my new 15 window Deluxe as I was
cleaning it I pulled out the floor mat to hose the cab out,lo and behold to
my surprise there was a seal at the base of the steering column. Mind you it
wasn't a grommet like bugs have but a flat piece of rubber fitted around the
column sealing the gap between the column and the floor, held in place by
the floor mat. Has anybody else seen this? Has everyone out there been
keeping this secret to themselves. This bus is very complete and original,
down to reciepts from Modern Cleaners found behind the seat from the 60's,
and the bus still has the OG logo's from Modern Cleaners on the sides.

ps; there is also a rubber plug in the floor under the clutch pedal about
3/8 of an inch in diameter. I have been fining all kinds of interesting
oddities on this bus that I haven't seen on any of my other 3 60's buses.
