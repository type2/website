Subject: Engine seized, now what?

Hey All!
I brought home a 64 Camper last night that I received as a part of a barter deal for another car.  The PO didn't know what was wrong with the bus. The only thing I have done so far was to try to turn over the engine using a wrench on the pulley nut. NO MOVEMENT! i couldn't get the pulley to turn.  Seized engine, right?  Anyway, since this is a spare bus, and since I got it for next to nothing, I am going to try to rebuild the engine myself.  I plan on pulling the engine this weekend and after that, I guess I just start to disassemble the top half?  Question is: What should I be looking for that would cause an engine to seize?  Any possible scenarios that may help me find the problem quickest?
