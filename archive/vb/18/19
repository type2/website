Subject: RE:Garage too short and  some info

Do the Harbor Freight thing on the dollies, I have a set i use and they do
just fine. As soon as i can i intend to add a couple more sets.
 As for the info as i said before i'm scheduled for nasal surgery tomorrow
so we'll be closed. As for parts for now i'm saying they are suspended till
i recoup which i am told is 2 to 3 weeks, i have no idea yet. The shop will
still be working during that time and i should be here for calls and such. I
intend to update the web pages this weekend so hopefully they'll be up by
sat. or sunday. I'll post to the list when they are up. I'll probably be
spending alot of time in front of this thing during that time also so you
can look for me in aim if you run it,,, metwiz2,,, also there ,,later folks
