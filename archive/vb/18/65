I attribute this thriftiness to my wife... Who beats me senseless every time
I bring up the topic of dumping money into the 911 ;)  

I think we can all relate to this story.  If I were single, oh man, I cannot
even imagine how much I would be spending on car stuff!

Luckily she likes the 911 and lets me play with it.
