Subject: brakes

Hi.  I just got my 66 bus back from the restoration man after 17 months in 
the shop.  It was only $1500 + cost of door and window seals.  It looks 
great!  I noticed the brake pedal now sinks to about 1 inch above the floor. 
  It makes braking uncomfortable.  The pedal always used to be stiff and my 
previous mechanic said the bus stopped on a dime. Any ideas as to what could 
be the problem?  Something resulting from sitting?
Thanks in advance for your help...
