There was the Mosaic option. I was camper kit that you could buy at 
the dealership that would install in your bus when you removed the 
rear seats. It utilized the existing interior panels unless of course 
you had a Kombi that did not come with interior panels.

I have also heard the complete camper interiors were available at the 
dealership to retrofit passenger buses. The seems to apply more often 
to early model bay window buses.

Perhaps a clever owner did the install on your bus. I do not think 
Westy offered the small poptop until the 1966 model years.
