Subject: My New '64 is 6 Volt, good or bad??

Hey Y'all,
I am picking up my "new" 64 Camper tomorrow.  It is not currently running, so I expect to post a bunch of questions here in the coming weeks.  But for now I have these questions:  The bus is on the original 6 volt system, I know you can buy kits to convert to 12 volt.  What are the advantages of having a 12 volt system over a 6 volt system? Are parts for the 6 volt harder to find?  What are other pros & cons of each??



Peace, John Baker
