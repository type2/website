Well.....

Again, take this as an opinion, but if the choke is adjusted too far shut,
the choke itself will do nothing unless the power is enabled.  When I say
"Do nothing"  I mean, it will no close and WILL WORK regardless of the
adjustment.  When the power is enabled, the "bi-metallic strip" takes
control over the choke flap, forcing it to close an incorrect amount.

Thank you.

[...]

I don't understand the fix.  When you disconnect the choke, the
engine starts.  But the position of the choke doesn't change because
all you've done is disconnect the heating element.

I sounds to me like the choke heating element is grounding the coil
when the element is cold.  After you disconnect the choke, no more
ground.  Once the engine and carb warm up, the bi-metallic strip
moves slightly and the short no longer occurs.
