Chris- Ask your welder if he really means  Dichromate plating.
That's the yellow color to which he refers. I believe that cadmium
plating does not have to be yellow ( even tho that's what the word means ).
However you percieve it, the westy tent poles are not plated.
The tent poles are a tinted shellac or varnish and easily scratched.
Dichromate is only about one micron thick and scratches also.
Same for Anodize. I plan to find a suitable powdercoat tinted clear
( or another color ) and mask off the joining portions if necessary.
On my original poles, i think the corners are welded, not brazed.
