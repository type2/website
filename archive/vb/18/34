Subject: HELP wanted `55-`61 front door panels $$$$$

Hey folks, have a `60 westy super low miles all
original.  Only prob is front door panles were hacked
for speakers.  I have found 2 sets of originals in
fair shape.  But I need nos, mint or exceelent
originals!  I am willing to pay more MEGA big bucks! 
Or will trade for bus or early bug stuff I have! 

I really need help with this...I am willing to pay big
cash and also give you a set of my decent origs for
your mint originals.  This bus is museum quality and
deserves better then repops!  HELP me out somebody
please!

Just to clarify what i need, it is the gray comercial
style front door panels found in any panel, kombi,
single or double cab...also used in westys.  These are
the ones that are attached to the doors via screws and
have the map pocket.  `55-`61 dates may be found on
some `62-`63s too...

Finders fee paid for a score!

Thanks!
Todd
