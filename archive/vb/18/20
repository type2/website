Subject: 71 Westy for sale in NC

Hi all,
I've decided my plate is too full and will be selling a 71 Westy. It needs
some TLC and my 67 bus & 69 bug have used all mine up for the time being. It
has a few problems to deal with but the camping equipment is all there and
in good shape. Has some surface rust that the PO painted over, looks as if
he cleaned it up but didnt fill it, and the floor pan is in very good shape.
Needs canvas up top. has a 71 AE block car engine. Dont know the history of
the engine, but it runs. Original paneling. Needs front seat covers, and of
course the sink pump needs replacing. Would make a great fixer-upper for
someone with the time. First $1250 drives it off. Thought I'd give the list
first shot before advertising elsewhere. So come on folks, I know somebody
wants her.
John
