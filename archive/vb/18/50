Hi John,
About the only bad thing about 6 volt sytems is finding some of the parts 
new!  Though on the other hand it is easier to find good used parts for six 
volt systems.  If you go through the wiring system to completely clean and 
seal all connections, solder up the rivets connection in the head light 
switch and solder the clips together in the fuse box the six volt system can 
be far better than most 12 volt systems being used out there.    Eric&Barb
