 If the bus is only too tall by a c**t hair than maybe you can adjust the travel on the opener motor and tighten the return springs.  Sometimes you can gain an inch that way

First thing I would look at would be pulling the door out and reframing
to get a few more inches. I know it sounds extreme, but how long do you
plan living there? Do you really want a garage door that cannot easily
accomodate your bus and any future busses you may want? Do it right the
first time is usually the best policy. That's what the old timers used
to say when I was a youngen.
