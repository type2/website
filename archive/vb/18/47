Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Fitting my bus in my garage


Reminds me of an episode I had when I was putting the
new engine in my '56 sunroof kombi.  I'd rolled the
bus into the garage, removed the engine, then rolled 
it out.  When I went to roll it back in to install 
the new engine, it had 'lifted' because of the unloaded
rear suspension.  The little support at the edge of the garage
door caught on the *new* sunroof cover, and put a nice
rip in it where it caught each of the bows. :(
