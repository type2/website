Subject: Deluxe Poptop Westy?

Hi list,

Is there such a thing as a Westy factory done SO-42 w/ pop top in a Deluxe?
I recently purchased an original paint '65 13 window deluxe off of Everett's
site which has what looks to us like a very well done poptop.  It has a very
clean roof rolled "curb" like other original Westy pop tops, and the
original Deluxe headliner is still in place! All the SO-42 interior is in
place and it seems to be a '65 vintage kit w/ clam shell lights, etc.  Is
this a very well done hack job, or a rare factory job on a complete Deluxe?

TIA
