advantages of 6V-   don't have toe buy all the 12V parts and swap them over

people often give you 6V stuff

wierds people out.  (amusemnet value)

advantages of 12V-
    dont need an adaptor to run a modern music machine
    parts somewhat easier to find new( but you can get all the 6V stuff- you 
may have to drive or call a couple stores)  I had to go to Schuck's to get 
6Vlight bulbs when one burned out in the 59 SC I used to have, Al's Auto did 
not have them

if it isn't broken, don't fix it.
