 You may want to try J.C Taylor if it is not a daily driver.  They specialize in Antique auto insurance and I have them on the 55 Pritschenwagen, 66 Beetle & my Packard.  They denied insurance for the 66 Deluxe and said that they do not insure buses, but I think that the real reason is that the only pictures that I had of it still had the wild hippy paint scheme and now it is n primer.  You have to send in pictures and they will approve or deny you on a per vehicle basis.   They are pretty much in the business of insuring only antique restored vehicles.  If it is a daily driver you may be SOL and I am damn surprised that they took my P-wagen.
Btw, $300 per year is pretty reasonable in Chicago.  Insurance rates are based on what zip code you live in.  The next cheapest reputable company that I found was Farmer's.

work ....Same company for the past 3 years...I called
them..Oh they want me back...for $300 a year..Hey that
is Crazy talk!!(haha)Maybe they did not like the low
rate I had...$200 bucks a year...Well anyways anyone
know of a good company that likes old dudes that drive
a bus when the bus feels like a ride? I am thinking
this time I will get a tow package just for the peace
of mind and a CB radio to call in on...breaker
..breaker rubber duckie here..come on!Also any company
I should stay away from?..Superior Insurance Company
out of Alanta GA(empty gun rack for insurance rate
cut) are the ones that cut me loose without any notice
in the mail.And me without a ticket or claim for over
20 years or more. My
2 cents on the low garage door thread...Ya got to go
in backward at speed then pull the E-Brake hard...That
will sit the back end down while compressing driver
and a big heavy co-driver to the backs of their
seats...when they pop forward that will push the front
end down as you slip under the door....How you get out
I have no clue...Most likely it wont start anyways.
10-4 over and out
