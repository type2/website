Where is this device ( or feature ) located ?
I can only assume the anti-dive properties of a split-window bus
to be a combination of the front spring rate and the damping
characteristics of the front shocks. Then again, why do such
a good job on the front and let the rear suspension hang
it all up (with a V-wedge squat 8^) ? !
