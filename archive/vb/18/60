Follow Thoms advice ! I did this early this year( different car) Insurance
told me it was worth almost nothing, theirs CO. and mine CSAA, the receipts
1" thick made all the difference or was it when I called back a few days
later and told them my neck hurt ? I thought I was going to court over that
one but they send me a check so a good ending. Hope yours works out too .
