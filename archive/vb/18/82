I found that same seal on my steeering column base in my camper. There is=
 no markings or part numbers- just a round, flat, boring seal. I am prett=
y sure it is original as the steering wheel is just about worn flat from =
use and doesn't look like it has ever budged or ever will when it is time=
. The P.O. wasn't one for fixing things that weren't broken (didn't belie=
ve in fixing broken things correctly either).

On my new 15 window Deluxe as I was
cleaning it I pulled out the floor mat to hose the cab out,lo and behold =
to
my surprise there was a seal at the base of the steering column. Mind you=
 it
wasn't a grommet like bugs have but a flat piece of rubber fitted around =
the
column sealing the gap between the column and the floor, held in place by
the floor mat. Has anybody else seen this?Get more from the Web.  FREE MS=
