Subject: RE: [VB] Deluxe Poptop Westy?

  My one owner 1964 Westy SO 42, that I sold to West Coast Metric had Clam
Shell lights in it, where as my 65 SO 42 that I also had at the same time
has the rectanguler light covers with dome light bases and the 66 SO 42 I
parted out (2 owner, near mint, till a tree feel on it) had rectanguler
lights in it that looked like they were from an RV store but were the
original lights.

I once saw a very nice original white/white 66 or 67 deluxe with what looked

like a factory installed so 42 westy kit in it.   
  Ya, check the M codes.  Check under the Z bed to see if the rear seat has 
the side hold down screw piece welded into the body.  

I though clam shells were earlier than the so 42 kit.  That so 42s and so
44s 
had the rectangular light covers, that in cross section are a U

the westys z bed should have a tag on it near the floor by the side doors-
it 
would say what year  on the tag- that the kit was made.

IN any case, enjoy the bus  :)
