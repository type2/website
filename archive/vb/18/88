Subject: Re: [VB] Insurance for the Bus..& dding a 16yr_old

I just added my 16yr old stepdaughter to my policy
When I got the bill I found that my 63 singlecab had become $650.00 for 6 
months!!
This is more than the 98 Mazda, the 70 Westy & the 85 cabriolet combined!
I called the agent and he said that adding her to drive my truck was the 
cheapest was to do it & I should be glad that she was not a 16yr old male(-at-)!
So be warned insuring a 63 singlecab with a 16yr old in the house is not 
cheap!!
