Try Condon & Skelly Insurance.  They specialize in antique, classic and 
special vehicle insurance.  They are located at:

Suite 203
121 East Kings Highway
Maple Shade, N.J. 08052
Phone = (800) 257-3434

They place through the St. Paul Insurance company.  I just insured my '56 
Kombi, with max. liability, comp, collision and even the PIP waiver in New 
Jersey (land of the highest insurance premiums in the nation).  The total 
cost is $151 per year.  Check them out.  Good luck.
