( Glad you didn't ask about Noses, Stewart 8^)
    Several interesting possibilities-
1) At 88 mph, hit the brakes before the garage door,
    the suspension will compress and momentum will
    propel the bus thru the door.
2) Dig a hole in the floor ( about a foot should do it ).
3) The bus is less tall sideways, just roll it over and push it in.
4) Use the Metric System. Round off the "inch" using conventional
   reference tables, and the bus will drive right in.
