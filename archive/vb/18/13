Subject: Bus for Sale

It's been a while since I've been on and this may explain why.

I will be selling my 1966 13 window deluxe.
I'm in IN and have done tons of work to this thing but just don't have time 
to keep up with the repairs and rust anymore. If you would like more 
information I'll send it p-mail.

Thanks everyone for all the help. I'm gonna miss my bus but it must be done.
