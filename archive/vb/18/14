Roger that, I just went ahead and had a local paint store match the color
and I sprayed them myself after sanding and prepping and they looked pretty
nice even after four years. They still get scratches on them just from being
in the storage bag with the other poles. Unless you wanted to have
individually made bags for each pole there is no way to avoid this, spray
your poles and enjoy your tent, just my opinion.
