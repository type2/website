Subject: Crewcabs and fences and the CHP

 Went to Tulare Calif. from Havasu Sat. ( 400 miles each way ) to pickup a 65
crewcab. Got there Ok and got crew loaded and took of for Havasu. About 30
miles south of Tulare met one of Califs. finest CHPers. 76 in a 55 speed
limit. Yea I tell him, just keeping up with traffic. Tells me anyone towing a
trailor in Calif can only go 55. Tell him to call the wreckers and ambulance
as there is going to be one hell of a rear ender crash if I'm only going 55.
He comes bach and kind of agrees with me, no speeding ticket, but a ticket for
" being in a lane other than the right lane" What the hell is this I ask, he
says trailors have to be in the right lane only. Should I pay or fight it?
 Here's the fence part. Get the crew unloaded this morning and get things
hooked up and fire up the motor. This is throught the crews side door, and I
see the shift cable is rubbing on the front pully so I go move it and the bus
jumps in gear and takes off for the next door chain link fence. I panic and
grab the side door ( instead of just pulling the coil wire) and get dragged
about 10 feet and let go. The bus plows down the fence and I think the damn
thing is goint to go into the deep end of the pool, but it stalls out when it
hits a shed. The wife runs out and thought a plane crashed. Will contact my
insurance man in the morning. Got some nice "after" pictures. Will order a new
B&M shifter kit in the morning, afraid to drive as is now. Throttle cable is a
work of art also (kite string). Will fix it, then work on the brakes. Always a
few bugs to work out when you bring home a new old bus.
