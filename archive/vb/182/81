The 68-70 master cylinders cannot be used because no one makes a reservoir
with a cap to go on them.
The 68-70 masters have nipple holes that are 100mm center to center.
67 duals, 71-79, rabbits, and early Volvos are 85mm center to center. [Volvo
reservoirs work better, the cap is level. Rabbits are on an angle....]
68 and up buses use an upper and lower reservoir. 68 is one year only. The
connecting pipe between them is metal. All the others are plastic.
