Subject: RE: [VB] RE: Bus cover

I have one from Motorworks. 200.00 thin as h3ll, delicate, but waterproof
and breathable, seems like the NOAH fabric Wolf has. Roof rack prevents full
coverage.
For 199.00, the Harbor Freight or Northertools (I forget) has Rv covers that
look promising for roof rack equiped buses. Might be REAL big, but oh well,
better than the lower doors always exposed.
