Ya, it did have a bypass.  I think something broke inside, cause when I went 
to throw it away something was rattling in there.  :(    Idling above 70psi 
when cold is a lot of pressure.

 Good point.  The pressure would rise until the relief valve opened in the
 case.  The passages could take that pressure, but a thin oil filter can
 may well distort.  If the oil filter gasket is 2-1/2 inches in diameter
 and the pressure is 70PSI, the force on the face of the filter would be
 350 pounds which could distort the sealing surface and dislodge the
 gasket.
