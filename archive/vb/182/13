Hi Tom,
Remove one of the wires from the brake sender on the MC and see if the brake 
lights go out.  If not check if you have the running light wires wired to the 
brighter brake/turn signal filiments,  If the brake lights go out you have a 
bad sender or not enough play between the brake pedal push rod and the piston 
in the MC.
