Subject: want to undercoat my bus for winter

List,

I posted this question on the type2 list last week but didn't get any 
answers.  Thanks in advance for your help.

I was wondering if there's something I can get like at Home Depot to 
undercoat my bus and just apply it with a big paint brush to prevent my bus 
from rusting.

Has anyone done this?

Thanks,
Daniel
