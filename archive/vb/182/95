#4 or 0000?
#4 sounds like it is very coarse and would scratch glass.
I use a product made to remove water spots. Called Shiny Brite II. Not sure
how wide a selling area it has since it is made here in Fresno, Calif. I am
sure a product like it is available at any big real hardware store.
On the back of the bottle, it says: "A safe, easy to use formula for removal
of hard water stains from clear shower doors and enclosures, patio doors and
vehicle safety glass".
They also make Shiny Bright, but you can't use it on tempered glass.
