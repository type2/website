It could be that the brown wire from the switch to the dimmer relay is
grounding out somewhere.  The dimmer switch is just a momentary contact
to ground.

That will work.  The only difference from stock is that if you have the
hazards on and step on the brakes, the hazards will probably "freeze"
with all lamps on until you step off the brakes.  Inside the box, 54F
is connected to the wiper/common of a SPDT contact.  54 is connected
to the normally closed contact and 49a (the pulsing signal) is connected
to the normally open.  When the hazards are on, 54f isn't connected to
54 anymore, so stepping on the brakes has no effect.
