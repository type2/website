Ok I expect I will have to replace the drag link then.  I would like as
little play as possible, but most UK buses seem to have a lot of play in
there steering - they yearly MOT test allows 2 inches of play I believe.

On the subject of removing the beam, the only part I have left to do is
removing the front shift rod.  From postings I remember in the past I
believe this can be quite a pain.  I have plus gassed the area several times
in the hope of freeing it up a bit.  Now in the manual it says to remove the
screw.  Is this the square headed bolt - I couldn't see any slot for a screw
driver.  Should I use a pair of mole grips on this?

Thanks
Paul
