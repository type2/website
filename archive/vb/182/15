Subject: looking for my old bus (VA Beach)

Volks,

I lived in Virginia Beach for 2 years, 1994 - 1996. I brought to the Hampton
Roads area, a 1965 OG paint 21-window. I traded it for a '78 Auto Westy with A\C
in 1995.

It was two-tone Seafoam Green and white with all the seats and
everything.....but REALLY rusty. It needed everything.

Well, I would like to find the current owner of this bus and possibly get it
back....

Any listees in the VA Beach, Chesapeake, Norfolk area that have any knowledge of
this bus would be appreciated, even vague leads....

The guy I traded it to was in the Navy and lived just West of Lynnhaven Dr,
South of the 44 (I think its now the 664?) He drove an oval and had a rail and a
couple campers (parked on the street).....

I think his name may of been Dave....

Anyone?
