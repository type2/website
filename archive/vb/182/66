Subject: RE: [VB] Rabbit Resevoir???

Hey Dave,
when I upgraded my 67 dual circuit to a 72-79 bus MC I used the 79 Rabbit
reservoir with the original rubber reservoir seals from the 67 MC. I dabbed
some brake fluid in the seals and on the reservoir nipples  and firmly
pressed it into the MC with a little side to side rocking. It went down all
the way, but was real firm!

For anyone using the Rabbit Reservoir:

Is the res suppose to set flush against the Master Cylinder? Seems if I put
the Grommet in first the Reservoir will not go all the way down.  If I put
the
Grommets one the Reservoir first if will not go in the Master Cylinder.
