Not sure what you were reading when you wrote this....
I think you meant 40 weight?? If yes, the chart in the 68-79 says it starts at
20C / 68F.

From the 63-67 Bentley, section S-3, page 9:
from 0C / 32F = SAE 30
to     30C / 86F = 20W/20 or SAE 30

From the 68-79 Bentley section 9, page 5. There is a viscosity chart pictured.
SAE 30 is listed for temps from 0C / 32F to 25C / 78F.
The 20W/20 that the 63-67 listed as being the same temp range as SAE 30 is
shown on this chart differently.
Minus 10C / 17F to 10C / 50F.

From the back of a brand new bottle of Castrol 30:
"Use above 40F"
