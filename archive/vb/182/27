Just looking at the wiring diagrams, it looks like the four-terminal switch
started in 1970 for USA-specification Buses.  It could have started in 1969
but I don't have a diagram to check.  1968 and earlier Buses used a three-
terminal switch.

The extra terminal is most likely for the buzzer that sounds when you leave
the key in the ignition and open the driver's door.
