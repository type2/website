 Good idea!  Any recommendations for a US supplier that ships abroad if I
 cannot find them in the UK?

not offhand, I'd check the normal VW supply places.  I think they are fairly 
inexpensive.

 It is the drag link that has play at the steering box end.  I can push the
 drag link sideways (ie towards the side of the bus) and pull it back by
 about half an inch I think.  There was some play in the steering, about 2
 inches which I believed to be normal.

the way I check it is have a friend lightly wiggle the steering wheel while I 
lie under  the bus with a light and watch the ends of the drag link and tie 
rods.  they should not wiggle.  Any that wiggle need replacing.  I also eye 
the swing lever - the bit in the middle of the beam- the top part should 
rotate back and from, if it wiggles/goes up and down, it needs to be 
replaced/new bushings.  Never did that myself, but I hear it can be a pain, 
and that it is much easier if the beam is out as you don't have things 
falling in your eyes and also that there is more room.  I like as little play 
in the steering as possible.
