Subject: Seal for heater tube

Where the heater tube comes up through the cab floor at the front there is a
seal.  On my bus there is only half of this seal left.  Does anyone know of
a company thats sells a reproduction of this seal as I have not found any
leads in the UK.  I could just seal the gap with seam sealant but if I can
get the correct seal this would be better - not sure how I would go about
fitting it though?

Cheers
Paul
