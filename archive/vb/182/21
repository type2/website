Subject: bon ami replacement??

ok, i went to SCRUB my pistons and cylinders prior to installation, 
and EVERY store in town has ceased to carry bon ami scrubbing powder.
ok, so its the only NON-ABRASIVE powder i know by name (recc'd by 
hoover and berg :)  ), but the store guys couldn't think of another 
one, either.
anyone have an acceptable substitute?
