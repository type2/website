Hi Ted,

Thanks for your reply.  What was wrong with your drag link?  The center pin
did not appear to have play after I popped the balljoint from the drag link
off but I am intending on replacing it whilst I have the front end apart.  I
am intending to keep the bus forever so I might as well do it whilst it can
be done without laying on my back!
How can you tell if the tie rods are bad?  It is very difficult to get the
fixed length tie rod in the UK now(possibly a RHD only part?? - would have
to check the parts books), I have a couple in my parts stash but am not sure
how to tell if they are good or not.

Paul

Play in the steering is NOT normal.The drag link sounds bad,also check the
center pin on the beam for play.

After replacing tie rods,drag link,center pin and adjusting the link pins on
my 59 it has no play in the wheel and drives very nice.
