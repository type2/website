Subject: US 9 wire TSS brake lights sticking on problem ?

I have a 1965 Deluxe which has the 9 wire US model Turn Signal Switch running
flashers as well as turn/brake lights.

It worked fine till the weekend when I realised the brake lights come on the
first time you brake - and then stay on till the engine is shut off.

I checked the switch on the master cylinder, and pulling the wires makes no
difference, so I assume this must be the relay in the TSS sticking.

Does anyone have any tips on how to clean this up, or resolve this - driving
without brake lights (well with them on all the time) is a bit worrying.

Thanks.

James.
