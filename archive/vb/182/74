Subject: Re: [VB] want to undercoat my bus for winter

As regards undercoat, I have sucessfully used
a gallon of plastic (not asphalt, not fiber) roofing tar
reduced with lacquer thinner for brush or spray.About 5 bucks.
Autobody supply stores sell a similar product ( and many others )
for more money.
Use a plastic drop under, plastic shopping bag
and a rubber band for head gear, and clothes to burn after.
Another popular choice is bar+chain ( chainsaw ) oil, which
must be reapplied infrequently. Whatever you choose, the surface
must be dry before application.
