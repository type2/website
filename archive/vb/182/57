i'm looking to avoid comet, or any other scouring-type product... the 
trick is to have a cleanser that cleans out the 'pores' of the metal 
with OUT scratching the cylinder wall. most of the stuff i looked at 
last night (5 different stores :P) have some sort of grit, 'polishing 
agent' etcetc.

i'll look at the dutch cleanser if i can find it.



what my search so far tells me is that americans WANT to scratch 
their to-be-cleaned items. or else its a giant conspiracy to FORCE 
them to scratch stuff, leading to early replacement  :)
