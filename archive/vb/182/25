This looks like a pretty close copy of the VWoA rack I have on my bus.
The only differences I can see are larger weld beads (the originals are
brazed) and black instead of white plastic plugs in the ends of the tubes.
The finish might be shinier on the repop, but I've not seen a new
original.

The original rack seems fairly strong, and is labeled at 220 pounds
capacity.  I've never pushed this limit.  I use the rack to hold bicycles,
extra spare tires, a plywood sun shade, and my antenna farm.

I have managed to crack the front supports, but this was from flexing and
fatigue, not loading.
