I pulled a '64 Nimrod (now for sale or trade) to So Cal for Pomona,  then the
Classic Weekend. Pulled great behind my '65 EZ Camper. Then I found a '64
Starcraft and like it a *little* more so I use it now. I pulled it to the
campout with my Square because the EZ is getting disc brakes and IRS and is
currently up on stands.
