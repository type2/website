Subject: Brake Lights Always On!

I need some help, my brake lights are always on. When I turn the key to the
first notch they are on, when I start the bus they are on. The blinkers work
when applied, but there is no difference between the tail lights and the
brake lights. I have a basic wiring diagram, but where do I start? Thanks
for any help you might be able to offer!
