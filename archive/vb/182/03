Near the fuse box, on that rail just below the front edge of the parcel
shelf.  You might have to take down the front trim panels to find it,
or the place where it used to be.

Actually that sounds like left to right, unless it's a right-hand drive
Bus.  The metal toggle switch doesn't sound original.

Probably not original.

Here's a shot of a bare dash from the left:

The above, modified for later models and annotated with switch positions:

Here's the dash in my '64, from the right.  The thing between the
fuel gauge and the speedo pod is the hazard warning light.  On your
Bus, the hazard knob should light up instead.
