Subject: RE:  Recent thread on Vespas, etc.

COSTCO now sells a Chinese-made copy of the early VESPA motor scooters.  They look to be pretty nicely screwed together and finished, but I have no info. about actual performance, etc.

Locally, 'Bargains Only' stores are selling electric scooters for just under $100.00 [down from ~$300.00].  

FWIW.....
