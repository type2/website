You're right about the T-3 dome pistons. We used to try and get them anytime
we could afford them for super VEE motors, until they disallowed it! WHAH.
Actually, a weird but powerful combo on the 1200 was a reground semi-stroked
66mm crank, factory rods, 82.5 dome head P/S with 6mm cylinder spacers and
punch the block and heads with custom size copper head seal. Really goosed
the power but costly.
