Hi Paul,
Hmm, are you sure you are attacking the wider side of the slide on 
locks/clamps?

Leave them greased for now.  They are a higher carbon steel so will rust 
easily if not coated with grease.

Best to find new zerk fittings and install them.  These will be grease free 
so will not bleed grease about when heated and ruin the powdercoating.

Hmm, not sure what you are talking about there.  You might want to look at 
the bus parts manual on the Obsolete AC Documents website for proper 
nomenclature.

We have seen this over and over again!  All due to gunked up old grease from 
not religiously greasing the front beam every 3,000 miles.  We take all link 
pins apart and clean them thoughly when we get a new to us set on a parts 
beam or complete bus.
