No good reason. The engine revs freely, and while the power drops off above 
about 4,200 it keeps pulling. On flat ground it will see over 4,700, and I 
had it "wound all the way back to zero" once before I installed the tach. The 
engine oil temp increases at freeway cruising over 4,300, with 210 F on most 
days and 225F on warm days. When it gets to 230 F, I slow down. I suspect 
this has to do with the efficiency of the fan falling off over 4,000. Another 
reason to lower the rpm for freeway use. I have the doghouse cooler, and plan 
to add a full flow filter with remote cooler when my next projects get done 
(IRS etc.)
