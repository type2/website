Subject: Re: [VB] 12V generator bearings anyone???

bearings are not too bad to replace, tho sometimes a bear to get off 
the shaft - keep the bentley handy!  the bearings themselves ain't 
nuthin' special... i am away from my garage, and so don't know a part 
# off hand, but in addition to the vw #, my local bearing house had a 
standard bearing # in the 'pooter - take one after removal to local 
bearing people and they can provide another. i upgraded to a sealed 
unit; cost maybe $5 for a usa made, $12 for a german. $3 for ??????

while in there, clean and TEST all the parts - i believe one of the 
vw rags published a simple  test protocol recently.
