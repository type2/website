While flat black paint certainly has its attractions,
Kevin, there are 3 objections.

1.Like all black paint it looks great after wash &
totally messy the rest of the time, showing up ALL
thumbprints, dirt, etc.

2.In summer it makes the bus a little solar oven like
the ones you can take camping. Panels are bad enough
without increasing that tendency with black paint.

3.More importantly than the previous 2, my wife has
put the kybosh on a black paint job.

Not that I'm really concerned.
I'm actually going to try going a dark rust colour
like the colour petroleum tanker train carriages go
after years in the elements.
We've got railway yards across the road from our house
& the old rusty look those carriages have is totally
cool.
With a flat rust paint job it should really look "da
bomb" ;o)

By the way, David, where could I get a set of those
steps?
They look cool & could be just the thing.
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
