Ha! Good question!  Luckily VWoA doesn't hold the
rights to Seuss characters or I'm sure they'd be
knocking on my door.  But, for legality sake, these
are not actually Seuss characters, they are loosley
based on Seuss characters. For example, some of the
art work includes: "The feline in the stovepipe cap", 
"Jump on your father", "The Grump who Stole
Christmas", "Morton, the packiderm", "Three fish of
various colors", "The Thorax, companion of the tall
bark covered plants" and so on. So as you can see, the
resemblance to the actual copywrited licensed Seuss
characters is strictly coincidental ;^) !!
