Subject: Last Call, True Canadian Winter Bus Campout is TOMORROW

Hi Volks,

One last reminder about the "True Canadian Winter Bus Campout" tomorrow 
in Cambridge Ontario Canada.

You don't have to be a Canadian to enjoy winter camping. If Florida is 
too far away for an overnight adventure there is still no good reason 
not to bring your westy out of hibernation for a weekend.  We wimped 
out on the "Camp on a frozen lake" idea, which is just as well since 
the ice on Lake Simcoe is too slushy on top. Instead we're camping at a 
Conservation Area with serviced sites and heated washrooms and showers.

Sunday morning we're having Breakfast Burritos, and then Jamie Rivers 
is going to lead a tour of the nearby waterfalls of the Niagara 
Escarpment. They should be pretty spectacular with the cold nights and 
warm days we've been having lately. Here's an example:

If you don't want to come camping, you can still join us in your bus 
for the tour, meet us at the park on Sunday morning.

If you want in on the group menu, you have until 6PM EST today (Friday) 
to let me know.

If you're coming and you can bring firewood, please do.

Happy trails,
