Yeah, I've gotta do the tests that you've well-outlined here, but I need a
break in this wet rainy weather first! Sheezz! you'd think it was the
rainy season here in the Bay Area!  No garage here to work in (I"m not
rich anymore :-( ).

It hasn't gotten so bad that it sounds immenently threatening, just the
occassional roar on starting, and a smooth whistle at speed. I was gonna
let it go til the rainy season stopped, but a siezed genny is the end of
the road if you're more than a block from your driveway. Fortunately a bus
goes by the house all the way to my work.
