Hm.. fuel pump was a good idea...

Ive sewed magnets in a bag made of a sleeve from an old t shirt, and tied the 
end of a metal coat hanger onto it, and ya then the gas cap doesn't fit quite 
right.   String sounds good too, I dunno.   the T -shirt material tends to 
last a while in the gas there, so string should too. I think I didn't use string 
as the magnets I had (from old speakers) were too big to fit down the fill 
pipe.  
hm.. but how to get the magnet to go to the bottom of the tank instead of 
stick to the fill tube unless you have a stick?  well, maybe can push it down in 
there.

  probably better not use plastic string.

Thanks for all the suggestions...my mechanic swapped the fuel pump with my
old one-no change, went back to the other fuel pump. Then he blew out the
gas tank outlet. That seems to have fixed it. He said it should probably
last for a while, but in an ideal world I should pull the gas tank, and
flush it...etc. Maybe in better weather, or next time I pull the engine.

I think I will try the magnet option suggested in the meantime. I was going
to get one of those donut shaped magnets on a string and drop it down my
filler neck, and then pull it up. Does that sound right? Any type of string
to use in particular, I am worried about the gas eating through some string
I use, and then losing the magnet...
