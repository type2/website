Subject: Re: [VB] 12V generator bearings anyone???

Okay, thanks everyone regarding the genny bearings! Whatever the solution
turns out to be, it'll be interesting. Probably need to wait for a break
in this rainy weather though.

I'll run through the suggested tests and see if I can localize the source
of the whine to the generator, then go from there.

Now it's on to finding those bearings!

Thanks again to everyone.
