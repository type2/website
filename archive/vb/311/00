Ya, just pry that piece into meeting up wth the intake.   I use a small 
phillips screwdriver to keep it in place while I install the first bolt.   I put 
the screw driver through one bolt hole, then the other one lines up.  .just 
attach all bolts/ nuts before tightening anything down.

Looks like you have the breather  tube from the oil filler on the gen stand 
going into the preheat on the carb.  that tube should go onto the spout 
sticking out the side of the air cleaner, and you can use th pre heat for pre heating 
the intake air . 

does your air cleaner have the spout for the breather tube on the side toward 
s the engine or away? It should point toward the engine, but you can use the 
other kind if the tube is long enough.    If you seach on the vintage bus 
gallery I have some pics of preheat and aircleaners and stuff like that up... 
search on my name...

I seem to remember someone mentioning how WW mufflers don't seem to seat
properly, well, I can attest to that now.

Should I force these things together?  How about bending the tube on the
muffler?  Any thoughts or warnings?
