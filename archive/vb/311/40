Subject: Re: [VB] 12V generator bearings anyone???

the generators use the following:
bearing number: 6202 G
VW part number: 111 903 221

you MUST get a sealed and greased bearing. otherwise
there will be no lubrication for the balls of the
bearing and they will seize quickly. i'm sure nobody
wants to do this job twice if they don't have to.

alternators use slightly different bearings in the
rear of the housing.
