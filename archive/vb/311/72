Amen!


Ellis spaketh:

NO! Tra-rust me, keep the wife. Parts are more available/affordable.
That
project is probably nearly dialed in by now, time spent under it is
probably
more enjoyable and maintenance will probably become lighter duty as time
goes
on. A good dependable daily driver is hard to find/keep.

Put on the Diana Krall CDs, nab some wine and go for a tune-up. DON'T
use
cruise control.

Dumping the wife might force loss of VWs and more. Tra-rust me.
