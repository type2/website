Subject: 12V generator bearings anyone???

I think I'm needing new bearings for my 12v generator. Does anyone sell
them? It's the standard common 12Volt unit. It sounds like they are
starting to whine.

Can the generator be disassembled fairly easily and can the bearings be
replaced? I'd rather not have to buy a whole new genny just cause the
bearings are failing.
