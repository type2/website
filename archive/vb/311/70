Subject: Friday Topic Moving to Hawaii Need Help

Anybody out there that knows please help. Looking to move to Hawaii this 
summer and do not want to leave behind my kids('66 Splitty, '77 Westy). Does 
anyone know of a freight service that can do this. Anyone have experience 
with this? I might have to leave one behind. But i am now trying to find 
someway to get all my stuff there and have found ways but not for the kids. 
Ever seen an ocean bound VW, wouldn't it be cool to see a splitty or bay 
window cruising to shore at Kapaho Kalahana Beach?

Thanks,

Michael Knight
