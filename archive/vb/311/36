Subject: Re: [VB] Front door pull handles & my ratty 67

It you have the short handle that you can't pull the door closed with on your 
65, it's a 66-67 handle.   They do fit on a 65.

I didn't see the 66-67 style on the WW catalog. They show the earlier style 
that you can pull the door closed with.   the 64 1/4- 65 style does fit a 66-67.

the 66-67 had little metal thingys on the door that the pull handle screws 
onto.   maybe your door was swapped?

looking at parts list...

113 837 225 A   inner handle to vin 575 830 (all models get chrome, it's a 
bug part)
211 837 225   from then to 1 222 025  (beige) (attaches w/ pin)
211 837 225 A  from then to 216 046 095 (beige)(think this handle started 
when the outer handles got push buttons)... looks the same as the previous 
version but screws on, not a pin

so actually the change was partway into the 66 model.

211 837 225 B from then on (called lever not handle now) (beige)

the chrome for deluxes inner handles have different part numbers

The 66 1/2 - 67 inner handles have a differnt escutcheon ring than the 60-66 
1/2 ones..

Talking about front doors...
I was futzing with my 67 riviera yesterday... decided to make the front doors 
lock... so I pulled the drivers door handle and took it apart.. turned out 
the cylinder was gummy and the pin springs were bad, so I replaced the bad 
spings.  Then the key worked the lock  :)  
The old mechanism was wonkied from when the door hinge was broken, so I put a 
good mechanism...  nice & lubed .. grease is good... on there.

took the old funky panel off the passenger side, ripped it to shreds 
actually, as the handle wouldn't come off.  One of those paddle thingys.   door was 
packed with fibreglass insulation, and was soggy at the bottom, even though It 
hadn't rained for an entire week.  threw all that stuff in the garbage.   Took 
the handle off.   Took the rear mechanism out (impact drivers are nice).  
Cleaned up the lock inside and greased the mechanism.  It is really nice to have 
the doors open & close nicer.   I can pop the little flip thing back with my 
finger.   Then I press the button and it snaps back out engergetically with a 
firm "click".


Decided to have another go at the brakes.    the right rear drum came off 
nice and easy.   I think driving around with the axle nut a tad loose did it.  no 
damage to drum or spline.   I didn't drive very far or long like that.     
Now I have to get new brake parts before it goes back together and I can enjoy 
the doors.  sigh.

Maybe I should take the screw out of the handle and leave it out, on the same 
principle as the rear drum, that the handle will work its way loose.

"short inner door handles"....Are you referring to the "paddle" type things 
to open the door from the inside?  You pull up on them?

I have those on my '65.

close the door.

That's not what I have. I also have factory screw holes right below the 
slider window for the pull handle you guys are saying is 66-67.

Read carefully. WW says this is for up to a chassis number that ends in the 
'64 model year. 

I think '65 is in with the 66-67's.

what's up?
