Subject: re: [VB] Car Haulers, Central California?> Ellis says YES!

Ellis recommends:
Dave with "Cosmos Autotransport".
(714) 325-5555 cell or (800) 551-8471 homebase

Dave hauls for CFR (Rancho Dominguez) and other agents. He is very familiar
with VWs and the various concerns that they may present from the low-end to
high end conditions.

Dave has been very helpful in my case. He was scheduled to pick up a 63 EZ
camper last week. I was unable to make the bus "right" by the due date. This
one time Dave was nice enough to reschedule at no change in cost. Your
experiences may differ. Please be considerate to your hauler... if at all
possible.

Tell him that Jim Ellis sent you. I will not receive any monetary compensation
for your referral. What we will achieve is establishing and retaining a kind
hauler within the VW aircooled scene.
