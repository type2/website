Ellis spouts back,
Until the next one comes along... hahahaha! (no really)

Not "too good" au contrare! Just the opposite.
Not good enough would be more accurate.
Not enough time, energy, health (bad back) or income to afford the over priced
- under engineered repop parts and constant upkeep and repairs encurred through
regular use. I can't~ or choose not to~ hang!
Negotiating or begging an extra tranny from a buddy for $100. to $200 when he
needed rent, paying minimally for or snagging the engine out of a $200-400 rat
bus/bug and selling the rest of it for the initial cost... Ah, those were the
days. $1000.-2500. for dry and generally straight builder bus/bug or better?
Keeping in touch with the New Mexican busbarn mafia, regularly scouting the
mythical/legendary Phoenix VW junkyards- being able to scrub just about
anything that you needed/wanted on a Saturday morning? Grabbing the local
Phoenix newspaper before day break on the way home from all night partying only
to grab a cup of Circle K coffee  a pack of those heart clogging chocolate
covered donuts, a pack of 'Boro lights in a box ($1.25 thank you) and ending up
in New River or extreme edges of the Phoenix Metro area as the sun crept up
over the horizon? HELL YEAH~! =)
I can not afford $1-2 grand for a nicely done engine, $800.-1800. for an
end-to-end tranny or possess the parts/facilities/knowledge/time and stength to
build it up yourself? Yeah, in a former lifetime. In (my) current reality? No,
come on! F that!
Too good for that? Not hardly. I barely have time to flush.

I'm so old that I can remember when:
- Made in USA was a concept and a possibility,
- Marriage was a sacrament intended for baby making, 
- the Passion of Christ was in a book, 
- Republican meant less government, less spending and pursuit of honesty,
- and when "tax and spend" inferred support of Domestic programs.
