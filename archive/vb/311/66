Subject: Re: [VB] Last Call, True Canadian Winter Bus Campout is

Greasy volks,

What's with these Canucks, anyway?  Winter camping?  Heated washrooms
and showers?  AND, . . . AND . . . AND, they have a national trail that
stretches coast to coast, Vancouver, BC to somewhere on the coast in
Nova Scotia!  Limited to non-motorize vehicles and hikers.  Most of it
consistes of abandon rail beds, popularly called "Rail Trails."


Why is it that the so-called "greatest nation on earth" can't have such
recreational amenities and opportunitie?  Even the Aussies have such a
trail--both countries are roughly the same size as each other, 20-25
million, heck, CA has more people than that.  AND, they have a
geographcal area roughly the same size as the U.S.  (roughly)

Bus content: if we had a national trail like that we'd all be bussing
to it during the spring, summer and fall, huh!

I guess in the U.S. its "You play, you pay."  While in Canada and
Australia it's  "We all play, we all pay."
