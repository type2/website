Subject: Re: [VB] Tuning dual carbs

Get the Dellorto "book" from CB Performance. They also have a lot of 
information online at www.cbperformance.com.
A uni-syn measures air flow into the top of the carbs so you can set 
each carb to pull the same amount of air by adjusting the carb. They're 
not too expensive, borrow one if you can.
