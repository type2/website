Hey Andy,

You could incorporate some empi bus steps onto the side bumper
supports... This is where they bolted up originally.  You may have to
reinforce them a little since I cant think if the bumper helps the
structural integrity of the step.

My brother has suggested putting cal-look t-bars on
the front instead of the bumper cos it doesn't have
the seam to ruin the line.
That'd mean coming up with a use for the bumper side
mounts as I'm not interested in cutting them off just
as a whim.
I'm thinking of mounting 55w wide beam driving lights
either side on them.
Wotcha reckon?
