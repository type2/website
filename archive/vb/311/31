Subject: Re: [VB] Front door pull handles

What do you mean by "large inner door handles"? Are these the pull handles?.
The only handles I have now are the small handles that open and lock the front
door.

The online parts manual only lists these from chassis # 216 xxx xxx. WW also
lists theirs as 66-67. If pre '66 busses did not have these, how do you close
the door from the inside?

I've seen them at shows before. Have you checked on The Samba? You shouldn't
need them on a '65 if you use the large inner door handles.
