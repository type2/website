Can the generator be disassembled fairly easily and can the bearings be
replaced?
Hi Cal,
They can!  Any generator/starter/alternator shop should be able to sell you 
some.  The whining could also be due to the cooling fan rubbing inside the 
shroud.  Try grabbing the top of the fan shroud and tugging it toward the rear and 
then push it forward, carefully with the engine running.  If the whining 
shifts with this movement it is the cooling fan rubbing.
