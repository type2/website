Yeah!  [plugs ears with fingers]

I hear ya James.  I was actually drooling the other day when my Dad 
mentioned he wants to sell his cherry '93 Expl*rer -- cruise, AC, auto, 
*towing capability* ...  And the wife has me on a two-cars-in-the-driveway 
limit, which I'm about to reach when the '65 beetle vert rolls out of the 
shop and joins the '65 neunsitzer.  Gee, which child to sell?

Thank goodness She has a new H*nda.  Actually I'm lucky - short commute, 
no wee ones.  But <whine> I want a bigger boat, and need something to tow 
it with, so I can see a day when I might sell the twins and my soul...
