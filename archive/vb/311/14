Subject: Re: [VB] 40HP Muffler from WW

Volk-a-maniacs,

Well, I got the heat riser pipe bent.  I hate doing that.  If the weld holding
it on would have broken, I would just have to go buy an entire welder setup
and supplies to fix it.  Bummer huh?  :o)  It didn't so I couldn't... :o(

Thank you all for the suggestions.  I'll take them into consideration on
Saturday when I attempt to swap the muffler again.  My daily life gets in the
way between now and then and the header/dual-muffler on there now seems to
work just fine.  Goofy looking though.

To clear up a questions.  The muffler I bought from WW is German.  To be
exact, the markings on it are... some are not pressed into the metal very well
and are smudged so bear with me...
    Typz KBA 20025
    Made in Germany
    B Nr    761 0604    03 01
    Typ VW 22-28
    Hergt  LEISTRITZ  Nbo
It arrived from WW with a gray coat and some scratches to bare metal, but I
like Black as my accent color of choice (and I have a can of High Heat I was
just dying to use), so the muffler and all connected parts are now dull black
and somewhat protected from rust.

I hope that my ramblings and pictures are helpful to someone.  I do try to
offer as much info as I am aware is important so that other freshmen VW Bus
owners can learn from my learnings.  I know much of it is elementary, but its
all new to me, so it must be new to other newbies too.  Thanks to all for your
patience and help.
