Subject: RGB - 41mm socket needed

Hi all,
I'm just starting to re-assemble my RGB's, and I need to find a 41mm socket.  Does anyone know a good source for the socket( or good alternative) for tightening these nuts on the short axles?
 
I just finished pressing the axle tubes back into the gear housing after time-serting both sides.  I'm hoping to have the rear axle assembly back togather before the weekend is over.
 
Thanks in advance,
Matt Faust
