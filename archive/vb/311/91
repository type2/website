If he's a fair guy and made an honest mistake then I wouldn't try to ream
him on it.  Not much he can do beyond what you can do.

How tweaked is it?  Is the tubing still round, or is it pinched shut?  If
it is still round, you could probably make a straightening tool by cutting
a notch in a 2-by-4 to just fit around the tubing.  You then use this 2-by
and a plain 2-by with a couple of big C-clamps to press out the bend.

One reason why I didn't get my rack galvanized is that this makes it a
real bear to weld later on.
