I think there is 2 definitions of the rat look. The traditional rat look l 
think is basically like finding a bus that's been in a barn and getting it 
mechanically sound, but leaving it alone cosmetically. Many times lowered 
or raked.

The more current use of the term is used more loosely and seems to be used 
a lot for cars that are more along the lines of a "volks-rod". There's a 
whole website related to these vehicles here: http://www.volksrods.com/

Check out the message board there. There's always pictures posted in the links.

I call my Double Cab a Rat Rod. It really should be lowered in the front, 
but it's not priority for me. I basically made it look this way to give it 
a "look" for a few years until I get around to fixing it up better. Looks 
like it's going to be my sons VW. At least that's the story I feed my wife. 
See, my son is 7 years old right now. But I guess with as slow as I am on 
my VW's it's for the best that I've got 8 or 9 years to get it together!
