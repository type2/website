Subject: Re: [VB] re:roof rack damage

I think I have that same rack Jim does on my 61.   Mine is big enough to fit 
a 4x8 sheet of plywood.  just a bit long that  8 ft the rack is.   Sturdy 
rack, though I bent & cracked mine overloading it.  Not badly, just some.    Mean 
eventually to stop by the roof rack guy in E WA's place on a road trip and 
have him fix it.  I got him to look at it & he said he wouldn't want much

The long reinforcemenst really help.    You could put wood slats on your roof 
rack , they'd help.

Actually I guess mine is a 3/4 length rack...jim, mine is similar to that
one you have for sale except it doesn't have those supports in the middle
running the length of it.
