Subject: gear grinding problem resolved

For those of you who helped me diagnose my gear grinding problem, I
thought I'd share the solution.  As you may recall, I could not get my
bus into gear, especially reverse, when the engine was cold.  When it
warmed up (after about 15 minutes of driving), I could get it into
forward gears OK, but reverse was almost impossible without grinding.  I
have recently purchased the '64, and know little about what's in there,
except that someone has added lots of performance upgrades.  I tried
replacing the clutch cable and the gear oil, with little result.
 
Well, as it turns out, the PO added a later bell housing and a large
pressure plate & disk.  I think it was a "Kennedy 170", or something
like that.  Evidently, the geometry didn't work well with '64 linkage,
so it wasn't disengaging well.  There was nothing wrong with the
(oversized) clutch disk.  We put a standard '74 bug German pressure
plate and disk in, and it works great with no grinding.  Much easier on
the old leg too, since the old plate took some force to disengage.  It
doesn't have that strong power grab that the old clutch had, but who
cares?  I'm just happy to have everything working well.
 
Thanks for all your helpful advice.
