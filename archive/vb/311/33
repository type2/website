Subject: Re: [VB] Front door pull handles

OK. Is this the one you are talking about?

I have the small paddle shaped handles on mine. (Don't have a pic and it
isn't listed on the WW site). What year bus did these handles come on?

.....

66-67 buses had short inner door handles and a plastic handle that mounted
just below the sliding front windows that you pulled on to close the door. I
believe a 216xx is a '66 model.
'65 and earlier buses had large inner door handles that you pulled on to
close the door.
on a '65 you should have the one with the screw that goes through the handle
itself. The earlier ones use a pin that goes in from behind.

They don't show the 66-67 handle.
