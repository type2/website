Subject: Trip to California - little VW content 

Hi,

We are planning a vacation to California (LA, SF, Vegas, Grand Canyon, ...) in
august.
If we only hire a car is it easy to find some sleeping accommodation (hotel,
motel, b&b, ...) this time of the year without making reservations in advance
?

Recommended places to stay and visit ?

Any interesting VW shops or shows in the neighborhood at that time ?

Thanks for your help.
