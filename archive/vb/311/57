Yeah Ellis, we've heard it before, so you're too good now to drive a split.
Yawn, zzzzzz.

No, my last splitty bus is sitting on the left coast headed for Europe. Who
would have ever imagined that buses and their associated parts would become
expensive to the point at which I no longer could afford them?

It has become more practical for me (personally) to locate a fairly priced
Passat wagon GLX with all of the toys and tricks than it is for me to
locate,
maintain, insure and drive on a daily basis a prime example of what drew me
to
the buses in the beginning.
