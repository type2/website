Subject: re:Bus stalling

Thanks for all the suggestions...my mechanic swapped the fuel pump with my
old one-no change, went back to the other fuel pump. Then he blew out the
gas tank outlet. That seems to have fixed it. He said it should probably
last for a while, but in an ideal world I should pull the gas tank, and
flush it...etc. Maybe in better weather, or next time I pull the engine.

I think I will try the magnet option suggested in the meantime. I was going
to get one of those donut shaped magnets on a string and drop it down my
filler neck, and then pull it up. Does that sound right? Any type of string
to use in particular, I am worried about the gas eating through some string
I use, and then losing the magnet...

I am also going to order a spare 6V coil just so I have one handy, they
aren't readily available around here. That way I will be able to eliminate
that as an issue in the future...

Thanks again....
