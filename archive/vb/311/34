"short inner door handles"....Are you referring to the "paddle" type things to open the door from the inside?  You pull up on them?

I have those on my '65.

That's not what I have. I also have factory screw holes right below the slider window for the pull handle you guys are saying is 66-67.

Read carefully. WW says this is for up to a chassis number that ends in the '64 model year. 

I think '65 is in with the 66-67's.

what's up?
