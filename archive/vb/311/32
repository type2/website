Subject: Re: [VB] Front door pull handles

66-67 buses had short inner door handles and a plastic handle that mounted just below the sliding front windows that you pulled on to close the door. I believe a 216xx is a '66 model. 
'65 and earlier buses had large inner door handles that you pulled on to close the door. 
on a '65 you should have the one with the screw that goes through the handle itself. The earlier ones use a pin that goes in from behind.

They don't show the 66-67 handle.
