Greg, you're sneaky, evil & totally right.
Time to call VWAG's legal representation in the UK :o)
And as for oil leaks & reliability, I wonder how many
80's Hiaces there still are on the road, let alone
anything T(-at-)y(-at-)ta made in the 50's & 60's!
I don't know how many T(-at-)y(-at-)ta vans I've followed
running on 2 or 3 cylinder & spewing black oily smoke
everywhere.
The nerve of them!
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
