Subject: Anyone know of any serious rat look buses?

Hi volks,
At present I'm leaning more and more toward the
rat-look angle with my Australian '67 panel.
If I could register a bus like the Mercury Motors or
the blue bug_de_box panel that has that much rust I
would but our Aussie regulations are really tough
about rust.
What does make my '67 panel unique is the fact it
doesn't have a front seam.
When my panel guy repaired the section across the
front where the PO had cut out the rust, seam & all,
he didn't bother fabricating a seam.
It doesn't look bad since a bumper usually goes over
it but without a bumper it looks like a diesel
locomotive, especially with its current ride height.
Here's a pic:

Granted this is entirely impractical & without air-bag
suspension(which I'm not installing) I couldn't keep
this up I'm wondering what you guys think about the
look.
My brother has suggested putting cal-look t-bars on
the front instead of the bumper cos it doesn't have
the seam to ruin the line.
That'd mean coming up with a use for the bumper side
mounts as I'm not interested in cutting them off just
as a whim.
I'm thinking of mounting 55w wide beam driving lights
either side on them.
Wotcha reckon?
It would certainly have to have matt paint.
Does anyone know of a pic or link showing this sort of
custom style on a bus before?
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
