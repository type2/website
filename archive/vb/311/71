Want my suggestion? Dump the wife, keep the VW's. It's cheaper.

NO! Tra-rust me, keep the wife. Parts are more available/affordable. That
project is probably nearly dialed in by now, time spent under it is probably
more enjoyable and maintenance will probably become lighter duty as time goes
on. A good dependable daily driver is hard to find/keep.

Put on the Diana Krall CDs, nab some wine and go for a tune-up. DON'T use
cruise control.

Dumping the wife might force loss of VWs and more. Tra-rust me.
