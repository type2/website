Subject: roof rack damage

Well I just noticed that my roof rack got tweaked right in the middle...I
guess it was done by my mechanic when he had it up on the lift, and lifeted
it too high...

I have a full length all tubular steel roof rack, that was in great shape, I
had gotten it galvanized a couple years ago(3 or 4) still looks great. 

I told my mechanic, and he said bring it down and he would see what he can
do...I am asking you guys for suggestions, so I can be prepared to haggle
with him. He is a fair guy, and knows he made a mistake. I don't know if it
can be straightened out, it still works, it just is probably not as strong,
nor does it look as nice...

So any suggestions on what to ask for?
