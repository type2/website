Subject: Re: [VB] roof rack damage

Don't forget that I have a 3/4ths rack FS on the Samba.
I was talking to Everett today and the price that he mentioned is FAR below
what he thought that it was worth.
I figure that it will sell during the show season or locally. Shipping is of
course pretty out rageous on these.

See: http://thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/index.mv?alert+200402180857436532
for photos and details. Location Central Phoenix under lock and key.

I'm so old that I can remember when:
'Made in USA' was a concept and a possibility, Marriage was a sacrament intended for making babies, the Passion of Christ was in book format, Republican meant less government, less spending and the pursuit of honesty, "Tax and spend" inferred support of DOMESTIC programs for legal citizens and fruit came without labels. -ellis, 2004
