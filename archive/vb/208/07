Subject: Re: [VB] Friday question: Bentley typeface? 

I give up~! I was digging through my closets looking for my old professional
type specing books... in vain. The only book that I came up with was a dated
<1980> ITC Collection Headliner fonts, not the body copy ref manual that I
needed. It looks like I am old school and thanks to Matt R the mystery is
mostly solved.

Keep in mind that to some degree, each font collection has their own name
affixed to the particular "cut" of the font. ITC, the International Type
Corporation charged/charges a fee on usage of their licensed font faces. That
is why there were millions of variations of Helvetica, each with a different
name to a very minor variation.
