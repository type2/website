Never???  Never is an awfully long time.  Figure on getting buried in
your bus, do you?  ;-)

How many times have we seen folks have to part with their vee-dubs to
pay for a new kid, new house, new wife, etc. etc.  Nothing is forever. 
I love my truck, too, but I'm probably going to have to part with it in
another 20 years when I'm too old to crawl under it without breaking a
hip.
