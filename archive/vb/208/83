Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch/trans problem

Well I replaced the clutch cable, with no apparent difference.  The pedal
is soft, with the only spring action appearing to come from the return
spring on the clutch lever attached to the trans.  This lever seems to
travel forward easily, a distance of about 2", and then seems to to a
stop. Does that sound right?? Do I need to tighten the clutch cable
further, until the movement of the lever really begins to resist?

Bob Mon,

  Well, the easy fix of replacing the clutch cable still needs to be
completed by getting one-half to three-quarters of free play before it
gets hard to push.  So yes, you do need to tighten the clutch wing nut
more.  The various techniques have been explained in the archives.  If
this does not fix the problem, an engine pull may be needed.

Best,
