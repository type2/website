My sliding windows in my 60 standard are in really bad shape.  It's kinda like
they're cracked. Is it possible to get em replaced at a glass shop or do I
have to look for old ones in good shape?  It'll likely be tough to find old
ones around here.  What year windows will work in a 60?  I'm talk about the
windows that go in the driver's and passenger doors.
