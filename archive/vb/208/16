Subject: regluing panels?

Hi All-

I need to reglue some on the salt and pepper fabric back to the original hardboard panels. I was going to use contact cement but thought I would ask the list first. I also have this aerosol 3M "super glue" which i might use as well. Any thoughts out there or product preference?
