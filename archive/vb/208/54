Subject: RE: [VB] Clutch/trans problem

Hi Bob,
That very thing happened to me on my '67 Sundial about a year ago.  Turns
out a couple of the spot welds came loose on my clutch cable tube, up
towards the front of the bus.  Once I had them re-welded, it shifted just
fine.

Hope this helps, and your problem isn't too expensive.

Ed
