The vinyl killer DOES NOT move at a constant speed. Turn yours upside down
and move the needle and you will see that it compensates for the angle of
the record. It slows as it is closer to the center. I am listening to
"Boogie Woogie Mama" by Mac Davis as I write. Apparently, she has "legs up
to her hot pants" :-)

It is a miracle of design but still sounds like shit. You get the doppler
effect sitting beside it. Buy one and enjoy! It is a great toy!
