Subject: looking for screws...

hello

im looking for 8 screws , 4 on each side on the bottom of the windows of a
1960 bus.

the one that attach the Felt channel ( the bottom sliding windows metal
frame) to the windows frame, they are flat and small with a small 7mm nut on
the  other side (i need those too)

They all broke from rust when i removed them!!
