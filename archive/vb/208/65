Subject: repost: sheet metal

I have a 61 double door..
Does anyone have or know where(supplier/manufacture) I can get some of the
sheet metal I need to fix my wheel wells and the jack point  beams....
When cutting out the jack point beams does the bus lose some of its support 
even after the new pieces are welded in?
