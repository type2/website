Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch/trans problem

Hello all

Thanks for all your help.  As suggested, I went back and realy tightened
down on the wing nut.  It shifts like it should now.  Just so you know, I
did read the write up in Muir, and Haynes as well, before I started to
adjust the cable.  I got it all greased up. too.  I think where I got into
trouble is from my previous experience (on non-VW's), you would have a 1/2
inch of play BEFORE the clutch arm would start to move.  Here you start
moving the clutch arm right away, and have a 1/2 inch before the arm starts
to get difficult.  Anyway, a sincere and appreciative THANKS for all those
that made the effort to help.

This is a wonderful resource.

Bob
