a dirt floor barn will have a damp floor, even if you put a water barrier (ie 
thick plastic sheeting) on the floor and cover it with a layer of dirt.  If 
you live somewhere like the PNW wher ethe ground gets saturated.    that 
said, the bus will stay *much* happier  under cover than if you leave it 
outside.   Also, I think rocker rot like on that bus FS comes from water 
dripping in through old window seals, down the inside, and getting stuck in 
the rocker with misc dirt/dust, hanging out there as mud and rusting the 
metal away.   I heard the idea floated that hosing out the rockers 
occasionally is good, to wash the dirt out so you don't have mud sticking 
around.

54 kombi I used to have, when we got it home we washed it inside and out 
(smelt like mouse pee) and scrubbed it with soapy brushes and hosed out the 
rockers.  loads of dirt came out.   the only rust on that bus was in the 
rockers.  sold new in Kenniwick Wa (east- dry) then went to Missoula, so it 
was the dirt in there that made ethe rockers rot.  The paint on the front 
floor was shiny.

I've seen the rust on my 61 get worse since I got it in summer of 95 (I think 
that was when) sometimes it's outside, sometimes under cover.

 Doesn't seem to me that a dirt floor would make a difference as long as it's
 dry, am I wrong? I plan to put up a dirt floor pole barn in the next few
 years to store parts buses in. The NW rain turns them to swiss cheese if you
 leave em all in the front yard(plus the wife cries her self to sleep;-))
