Hey Guys

So it appears as though the latches do not go all they way through.  It
looks like the windows I need to replace are the sliding part and the
pivoting part, the fixed part is OK.  It looks like I also need new latches
for the sliding part - or at least a piece of each latch and the latch on
the pivoting windows could also be replaced.

TIA
