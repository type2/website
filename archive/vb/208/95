Subject: cyl head temp

Hey Guys:

I've been monitoring #3 cyl head temp with an under the spark plug 
sensor. For comparison, I monitor #1 as well. As expected #3 runs 
hotter. I verified that the gauges and sensors were measuring correctly 
by swapping the wires from one gauge to the other. #1 runs 25 to 50 
degrees F. cooler than #3.

I try to keep #3 from going over 350 degrees. To do that I have to go no 
more than 45 to 50 MPH. Going downhill gives me a chance to chill out 
the engine and I can make it drop to around 325 and sometimes lower 
depending on how steep and long the hill is and how cold the day is. I 
always get worried when the temp reaches 375 degrees. It is real easy to 
make it get that hot. By just keeping it in 4th gear while climbing a 
hill, or by going a little faster on the freeway (like 60+ MPH).

These temperatures are about same in both my 65 bus with a 1600 SP and 
my 79 camper with the 2 liter fuel injection. My 66 bug runs easily at 
25 to 50 degrees cooler. These temperatures are pretty reliable. I would 
like to know if anyone else monitors their temps and if there are any 
experimenters out there who are able to lower the temps any. I haven't 
tried to use an external oil cooler to help air get to #3 without 
getting preheated.

I have heard some guys say that at 350 degrees the valve seats could 
fall out because that is how hot they get the heads when they press the 
seats into the heads. On aircraft engines they have used sodium filled 
valves that dissipate the heat more quickly. Has anyone monitored cyl 
head temp while running a deep sump. I've heard the extra oil helps with 
cooling the oil too.

Optimal desireable cyl temps would be 325 while at cruising speed on the 
freeway at 60 plus. If I could keep it below 350 I would go faster.
