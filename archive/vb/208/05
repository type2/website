What size did you go for? I run 137.5/60 in my 34 PICT-3 and it seems to get
my loaded SC up and down the hill.

67 Single Cab, DP 1641cc 34PICT-3
71 Trike 1776cc 28/36  Pinto Progressive
VolksAir 1585cc 28 PICT
Ray, Kent WA
Bernoulli Interval: Do I really have enough data to draw a valid conclusion ?

Hi all,

Tonight, I changed to a slightly bigger main jet.  Took the 60' out for a
spin....and walla all is well.  It nice to have a little low end torque.
without the wiplash.
