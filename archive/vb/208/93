From your description this sounds like something inside the bell housing,
possibly inthe pressure plate or on the cross shaft that holds the release
bearing.  Two inches of easy travel on that lever doesn't sound right.

I suspect you're going to have to pull the engine.  My bet is one of the
arms on the cross-shaft broke off.  Any nasty noises when engine is
running and you try to operate the clutch?
