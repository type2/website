Subject: OCTO show report

Hi All,

I had a great time at the octo show yesterday...and thought I would post up
some pictures.  Unfortunately, I decided to put up the rest of my updated
web pages for the 2003 season at the same time and I cant figure out why
some of the link bar images dont show.... damn frontpage... I'm still
working on it but thought people would be interested in seeing pictures of a
few of the list members I saw.

As per parts found, I was overwhelmed by the number of nice burlap pieces I
was brought and all for great prices since it seems most people hack it off
and throw it away.  I ended up not finding my gas tank divider plates but I
have two located that are supposed to be *cherry* so I have one coming to me
and the other is on hold until I know whats up.... The one totally lacking
item is still the divider plate felts of which I was sent a few the other
day (web update on what these things really are coming soon), but still need
a few more.

Anyway, thanks again to all and a congrats going out to Richard Barker for
the good news he was spreading about himself....


David
