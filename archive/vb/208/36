Subject: Re: [VB] OCTO meet tomorrow

I forgot my description Well mine won't be hard to spot. '62 Grey Kombi w/ OG paint and OG owner painted white roof band (actually
it looks pretty cool) Swivel Seat standard (well carpet, insulation  and homemade grey panels installed for a quieter interior.
Panels not finished yet). Another dead give-a-way is the radio antenna mounted behind the front bumper (can't bring myself to or
ever want to drill holes in any splitty). Will have son (guess what his first vehicle will be.....lol) in tow. Hope to meet any and
all VB listee's there tomorrow.
