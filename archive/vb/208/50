Subject: Trip to N.M.

I am restoring  two vehicles one 1966 splittie and one 66 chevy LWB
step-side P.U.
I am going to a convention in Albaquerque(SP) in March, from home in So. Ga.
I am taking I-40 out there. I can come home a more southern route I-10 if I
want.
I was hoping to stop of at a few junk yards on the way back. Hopefully to
pick-up
some parts for both vehicles, from the rust free SW
Any suggestions ??
