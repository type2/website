Subject: VW Garage Sale

Spring cleaning has come early to Sacramento.  Need to clear some room in
the back yard so I can begin work on the shop.  I have a ton (probably *literally*)
of misc bumpers, doors, lids, engines, transmissions, and random sheet metal I'd like 
to move out.  Some pix are here http://vintagebus.com/sale/  I'll have more stuff listed
this evening, gonna go out and take more pix while I still have daylight.

The only caveat - I don't feel that any of this stuff is worth shipping,
at least not at these fire-sale prices.  

Bring the truck.

Thom
