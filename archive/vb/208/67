What I mean is you may not get a part that looks the same.You may get the right part but not the part you expected.I base this on eight years as a counter person.

Do not base your search on part numbers.Suppliers have a habit of
superceeding
and combining parts under a common number.Take the part to a compentent
parts
house and show them what you need,this gets you the right part more than
if you
go by the numbers.

I have to so disagree with this WRT vws. If I have a VW PN I have rarely
gotten a wrong part. When I have relied on standard FLAPS cross references
I have often gotten an incorrect part.
