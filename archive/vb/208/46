All buses have hinges in the third window back on each
side for pop-outs. Pop-outs in all 6 windows was a
M-code option. Chances are that if your bus is a
factory Westy than you only have hinges in the rear
two windows, you can add pop-outs here and put
stationary glass in the remaining windows. I have seen
where people have welded, riveted, and even screwed
hinges into the bus, but I wouldnt have that done.

 Can louvered westy windows be changed back to pop

 like the look of louvered windows and would like to
 change them. If 
 anyone knows the answer or has tried this I would
 like to know.
