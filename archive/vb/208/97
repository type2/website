Optimal desireable cyl temps would be 325 while at cruising speed on the
freeway at 60 plus. If I could keep it below 350 I would go faster.

I've already replied to this but want to add.
A windage tray and oil cooler will make your engine run cooler but it
will have only very marginal effect on your CHT. Closer to none than
some.
