Optimal desireable cyl temps would be 325 while at cruising speed on the 
freeway at 60 plus. If I could keep it below 350 I would go faster.

I run a CHT on an 83 Air-cooled Type IV.
Recent 15K new rebuild.
I routinely run 360+ on CHT with no ill effects.
In conjunction with the CHT, I look for 220 or lower oil temp and 47-60
psi oil temps at hard running 70 mph Texas heat of 100 degrees (f)
ambient air.
I ran my first engine 145K with no CHT, Oil Temp, Oil Pressure gauge.
I must agree that CHT is a good monitor but if you've got a good engine
tuned properly 350 is normal.
Hotter temperatures can be attributed to lean burn, wrong timing, too
much advance. Be sure those are right and 360 is reasonable.
City normal traffic I seldom see more that 300 on 15 minute runs.
If the length of the wire kit has been extended then you're getting
unknown results anyway.
To verify gauge correctness you need to get a new wire kit and run it on
the gauge before you add any wire.
