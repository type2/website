Subject: lowering a 59

I am trying to find the best and least time consuming way to lower(not slam) 
my 59.  It is at stock height currently and I would like to drop the front to 
balance out with the rear.  Dropped spindles?  source for them?  shocks are 
new, do I need another set for the drop...etc....thanx
