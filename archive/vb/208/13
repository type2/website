He states the lower body damage is from being stored in an earth floor barn.
Doesn't seem to me that a dirt floor would make a difference as long as it's
dry, am I wrong? I plan to put up a dirt floor pole barn in the next few
years to store parts buses in. The NW rain turns them to swiss cheese if you
leave em all in the front yard(plus the wife cries her self to sleep;-))
