What I mean is you may not get a part that looks the same. You may get
the right part but not the part you expected. I base this on eight years
as a counter person.

Ted :
I respect your cautions on this acquisition.
Some parts are just hard to get right because they are not "most popular"
and can't be ordered from Vendors Web Sites. It takes at least a one on
one telephone conversation to get the right parts. Historically it takes
me 30 minutes on line to order this type parts order.
My parts list is posted below:
