Do you have the vanes and thermostat installed? Hoover bit (if you have a 
doghouse oil cooler) and all the correct pieces of tin? Vanes straighten the 
flow, the hoover bit (frame sealing bracket) keeps air from sneaking past the 
oil cooler. 

If you don't have a doghouse shroud get one. It moves the oil cooler out of 
#3's way. Maybe your bug has a doghouse and thus the difference. 

Anything else out of the ordinary? 009 dizzy? Dual carbs? When you move away 
from stock it changes things, to say the least.
