Subject: "Love Bug" Campout (North FL) May 10-11 - interested?

Folks, I'm trying to resurrect the irregular Love Bug campout at O'Leno State Park, and have tentatively picked the weekend of May 10-11.  Please 
let me know if you're even remotely interested in that weekend (I checked the events calendar at www.sevwc.com for conflicts).

Possible activities include tubing on the Ichetucknee River, kayaking/canoeing on the Santa Fe, scuba diving at Ginnie Springs, etc.

We've done this a time or two in the past as a mostly-bussers event (though not exclusively so).  O'Leno SP is just off I-75 between Lake City and 
Gainesville.

Let me know if you want to do this,
Joe Clark
