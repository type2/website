Subject: pics of hacks to my bus

        Hey vw people!
              I've got a vw bus with some nasty hacks the PO did.  I don't
know what would be the best way to fix these, but I bet there is some nice
soul out there that might lend me some ideas??? If you have or know where I
can get some of the parts to fix my dash or partition, I'd love to know.
thanks so much
happy vw driving
john
