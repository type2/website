Subject: (F) Dream shop

For all of you daydreaming about a shop- check out this one, posted on
the Jeepster bulletin board- I can't imagine how great of a shape my  
VW's would be in if I had this facility...

Sure is no fun working on the bus outside in the dark and cold...     
(any other Jeep/Jeepster folks feel free to drop me a line...)
