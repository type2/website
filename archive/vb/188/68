Subject: Air Coolers Novemberfest pictures

Most all the Novemberfest pictures are now up in the Air Coolers Gallery. The turnout was better than I expected, I think there was more than 100 VWs there from all over Texas. Check them out at www.aircoolers.org click on gang photos, Austin and Houston both have some pics, I assume Dallas will put theirs up soon.



Thanks,

Brian
