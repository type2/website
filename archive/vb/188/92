Subject: Swap 16" barn rims for others?

Greetings All.

I have three 16" rims in good condition,  although needing
a clan and paint.  All are dated 1954.

I was wondering if anyone would be interested in working
towards a trade/deal on four 15"  5.5" or 6" wide five pattern
'hot rod'  rims (what have you got lying around ?).

I'm in Australia so some freight cost/hassle would be involved.  I
would be happy to pay freight on the barn rims and send .....

I'm hoping this doesn't sound too ludicrous but 16" rims are very
hard to find here and worth a bit.  I understand they could be more
plentiful (and thus worth less)  in the US or UK.....

Always happy to receive a bashing/opinions on this too 8-)..

regards

RobK
