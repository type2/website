Subject: re:shifter troubles

are you sure the tathat points up is on the right side(refer to the bentley
for a pic of which side it should go on) I believe the tab that points up
goes on the passenger side.

I had suggested to me the following:

loosen the bolts that hold the plates together. put the bus in reverse, then
tighten the bolts. that way you are sure to find reverse, and every other
should fall into place.

good luck.
