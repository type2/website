Dave and Craig,
Although valve stem seals are a great idea on water cooled engines where the
heads never reach the grueling 300-400 degrees, you will not find them on
many aircooled engines. There is an old, and I mean old, (around 1965-67),
VW report on the deletion of valve stem seals from the OEM gasket kits. The
reason is very simple. After heating to those high temperatures for such a
long period of time the seals become hard and brittle and of no value along
about the time in the life of the engine where they are most needed. GM
quite that practice in 65 with the advent of their tighter upgraded engine,
(too late and Nader killed them), and Lincoln and Lycoming never did
institute them, going for tighter tolerances and better material instead. VW
Rabbits had terrible problems with them, not because of excessive heating
just poor material, and later VW came out with better quality seals in all
the retrofit kits. The bottom line is that you can get seals, somewhere, but
of what value will they actually be when needed? That's why you don't see
them, even on the top of the line engines, and never on a factory engine.

Anyone have a picture of a factory motor anywhere from 1964 to 1967 to prove
me wrong?
