I proudly proclaim to be a computer geek and love my bus.  It is very 
relaxing to working on something that is not a black box or at least not 
as black as the computers I work on.

When camping my wife and I have brought our laptops(pc and mac) to do work 
when we were not hiking.

Since I have wireless and a camper I am going to make my bus the refuge 
when we one of need some time away from the our soon to be baby.
