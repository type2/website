Subject: Panel for sale

I've found a "more desirable" Bus so I am selling my  213 Panel (cargo
doors on the drivers side)
I bought it just over a month ago with intentions of making it my new
shop Panel, but bigger and better things have come my way so instead of
putting on the back burner to sit I'd rather see it go to someone that
will do something with it.

I've posted an ad on Everetts site
<http://thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/index.mv?photo+200211200359076193>

I will place an more detailed ad on my site
<http://vintagewarehouse.com/classifiedcars.htm>
once I get more pictures.

Hopefully some one on this list will see this Bus is worth saving.

Greg
