up and to jump the B+ to 61.
----------------------------
You can trust Bentley on this.
You just need to jump the two connections for about 1/2 second. The
jumper can then be discarded.
This sets the polarity in the fields.
Polarizing a generator is laughing called pulverizing a generator since
people do the process wrong.
