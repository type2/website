Subject: Re: [VB] SVDA distributor recurved to 009 specs.

I run a 28 on my 1600sp w/ an 09(I know vac dizzy to be installed soon.....I
just found my stash of vac dizzy's - 20 year collection of 09 removals) and
I get 24 mpg and have had no probs in 3000 miles w/ this combo. Only the
common hesitation of the 09.
