Hi Kevin,
Grease is definitely good and required!  We also have found that removing or 
at least reducing by filing/grinding of the locking lumps on the wing nut 
that lock it to the later diamond shaped rear clutch arm makes it alot easier 
to adjust.  We use the wing nut with all traces of the locking lumps removed 
on the earlier round shaped rear clutch arm and have not had problems with 
the nut backing off.  There is also the chance that the stud on the end of 
the clutch cable was threaded badly at the factory which we have found on 
several VWs!  This requires using a threading die to redo the threads.  Have 
not found but could also be the wing nut needs a tap run through it. 
 
  Lastly do not just change the rear clutch arms without changing the tranny 
side plate or installing the later seperate rear boden tube support.  
Changing the rear clutch arm to later or earlier ones will throw off the 
alignment of the boden tube pointing to the rear clutch arm.  This in turn 
will cause the clutch cable due to not shooting straight outward to rub on 
the tip of the boden tube and wear out about every 6,000 miles!!!
