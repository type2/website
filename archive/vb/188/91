Subject: Front window rebuilding

I'm looking at attempting to rebuild some of the lip that the rubber window
seal goes onto on front windows of my double cab.  It's on both sides of the
center pillar at the bottom.  It's pretty much non-existent right now.  I'm
going to be using a metal filler, similar to 3M panel bonding adhesive.
Does anyone have any tips on this?  I hope I'm making sense.
