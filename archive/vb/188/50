Subject: Shifter troubles

Hello,

I posted this message to the wrong list, Sorry if you get both lists but
this question is for the old stuff...

I have a 1957 single cab. I recently changed the hand shifter and reverse
lock out plate ( as the old shifter was worn to the point that the ball on
the bottom freely rotated and the shift play was very loose). I put in a
stock shifter and plate bolted it in and its was normal. Nice and snug, but
it won't go into reverse. Reverse worked fine with the old sloppy shifter
but the new one won't work. I tried loosening the bolts off but nothing? So
I swapped another plate and shifter from my other '57 bus. Same thing, no
reverse.(the shift plate is on correctly, with the angled tab pointing up)

Thanks, Trevor
