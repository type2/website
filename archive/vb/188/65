Subject: VDO clock question

I was curious if anyone has found an aftermarket clock that fits into a
splittie's clock hole, I was trying to get mine working and I let the
smoke out, so I either need to stick it's dead carcass back into the
hole, or find something else to take it's place.  I was looking for
other gauges, perhaps digital that would fit into the gas gauge, speedo,
and clock that would have a bit more information and be easier to read.
However, I do not want, nor would I ever modify my dash to support more
gauges, although my radio hole has already been cut so I guess I could
go all out and customize the entire thing.  Thinking out loud, sorry.
If anyone has dealt with this problem before please let me know how you
hurdled it.
