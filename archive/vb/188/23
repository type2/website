Hi,

Everybody forgot the cheapest solution - take the slow road.

When I drove my bus back and forth in college, I used a "country" 2-lane 
that ran parallel to the highway, and alternately the server/access 
road, and several other roads in between. It took about 30 minutes 
longer that way, but I could go at my own pace.

I did that because I was tired of getting the finger and ugly stares 
from people. On the back-roads, I'd get waves and the see kids in back 
seats saying "mommy, mommy, look, look!" - what a great feeling!

Our family hauler right now is an old Volvo wagon and people hate to get 
behind you doing 65-70. It doesn't matter what you run, if you're in 
front of them, you're in their way. Texas is cruel to the slow - ask the 
poor Armadillo.

Anyways, I just got a set of Mangel 15s so I can go the 205 75 15 (LT) 
route. Unfortunately I got the transmission rebuilt in the early 80s and 
at the time didn't have the extra cash for the freeway flyer. But I 
would go that way as well.
