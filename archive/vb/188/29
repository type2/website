well, the  205 75 R15s will fit no problem, but I'm not sure about the 215s.

I take it you meant yes to the last part.  hm, then it is geared pretty low.  
 I had a truck like that, tended to just not do freeway driving- set 52mph as 
the top speed.  I'd definately check that rear axle nut, but yes it is a PITA 
to change a tranny as well as parts costing money.   The tire deal is the 
easiest way to go, especially if it's got say 185 70 14s on there.  I mean, 
also themiddle number is a percentage width to height, so if the middle 
number is 70, that's shorter than if it was 75.

Is your son happy with the

    He is the one who asked me if the engine sounding like it does, is 
normal. HE LOVES HIS BUS, if we do nothing to it , he is content to drive 
55-60.all wound-up
...........
just wondering.  Ya the thing is not only is it noisy, but it does shorten 
engine life to overrev.   Personally I'm conservative and tend to cruise at 
3K rpms, though VW said the cruising limit is 3500.If he's driving 4500, 
well, it won't last so long, and will run hotter.  
------------------------------------
 One problem is that there is no interior at all!.Carpet, sound proofing, 
good window seals healiner and a stereo system, will probably help I assume.

I want to do some soundproofing, too.  I used the shiny bubble wrap from 
Home-Depot to insulat my camper, and it worked well and is easy to use (and 
dosn't hold water like fibreglas).

 I can not answer most of your questions I am much of a mechanic. I am elated 
if I manage to do a brake job without calling my mechanic!

these old VWs are very straighforward.  Get a copy of John Muir's 'how to 
keep your VW alive" and it really helps for most of the mechanical stuff.    
Enjoy the bus ! :)
