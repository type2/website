205/75-15 (not correct for '66) 
205/70-14 (close to the originqal size)

And creates all sort of other issues.

Having the trans rebuilt in and of itself doesn't solv your perceived
problem.  I say perceived because it doesn't appear to be a mechanical
defect, it's you just you don't like driving slow.   You could get
your transmission regeared with various bits to make a 'freeway flier'
but remember, everything's a tradeoff.  The freeway will be faster, but hills
will be slower, unless you're going to throw more engine at it.

I solved this 'problem' with 205/70-15 tires and patience.  

If he's really in a hurry to get places, sell the bus and get a Honda.
