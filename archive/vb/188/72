I waited until Friday to post this............

In order to get a better price on BRM's for next season I bought *alot*
of them. The downside is where to store them once they arrive. So I am
offering them up right now for $650 a set, that's wheels, center caps,
and lugs. These are the same ones I've been selling, brand new in the
box, nothing different, just a good deal!! Once I actually get them here

the price will go back up so this is a limited time deal.

Pass this on to anyone that you think might be interested

Thanks
Greg Banfill
