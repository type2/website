Subject: Todys bus hunt find

   I went out today (this morning) chasing down a lead I got on a corner
window bus and low and behold I found it (1963 15 window Deluxe, non walk
through, original paint). This bus was about 45 miles from here and at a
place I never knew existed. There are a lot of hidden wrecking yards out
here in the desert. The bus had sat there for at least 10 years, maybe more.
The owner couldn't remember, just that it's been longer then he could
remember. The bus is as rust free as they come with perfect rockers, doglegs
etc. The biggest bummer was that someone stole the rear hatch, corner
windows, jailbars and the deck lid. Both bumpers and all bumper and body
trim are still intact. If you look at the pictures I posted on the Samba in
the gallery you can see how it was stacked on top of other cars to keep
people from stealing even more parts from it.
   It's going to take a couple days of moving stuff out of the way to get it
out, hopefully I can pick it up after Turkey Day.
   I got lost a few times trying to find this place, I had driven with-in
site of it at least 20 times on other bus hunt adventures and just never saw
this place or the bus there.
  1 bummer is there was a beautiful Champagbe Edition Bay 78/79 vintage with
a sun roof. They stacked another car on the roof (very dented now) and drug
the bus by the beautiful.chrome bumpers. There are still a ton of good parts
on it though, it's complete less engine and trans, even the rear seats are
still in it.
