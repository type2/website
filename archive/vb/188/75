Subject: Re: [VB] VDO clock question

The clock in my 15 window doesn't work, but it looks cool and light up with 
the dash lights.  I got a little  (about 1" diameter) clock I glued to a 
magnet that actualy tells the time.

<< I was curious if anyone has found an aftermarket clock that fits into a
 splittie's clock hole, I was trying to get mine working and I let the
 smoke out, so I either need to stick it's dead carcass back into the
 hole, or find something else to take it's place.  I was looking for
 other gauges, perhaps digital that would fit into the gas gauge, speedo,
 and clock that would have a bit more information and be easier to read.
 However, I do not want, nor would I ever modify my dash to support more
 gauges, although my radio hole has already been cut so I guess I could
 go all out and customize the entire thing.  Thinking out loud, sorry.
 If anyone has dealt with this problem before please let me know how you
 hurdled it.
