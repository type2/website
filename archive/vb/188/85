I'm a linux/NT(yuk!) sys admin. I think the computer following stems
from the fact we have computers everywhere and the last thing we want is
a machine controlled by one in the engine bay, back to basics, primal
carbs and points.
Of course, some techy I'm certain has EFI, GPS, Mp3, Solar, HAM, FRS,
and programmable advance, all controlled by some laptop.
