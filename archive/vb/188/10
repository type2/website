Both of the pages you mentioned are primarily for new zillion-digit
VINs

In your '66:

23=Kombi (what Westfalia based their campers on)
6=Model year 1966
017302=serial number, sequentially assigned

From that number, 17,302, your bus was made at the end of August 1965.
Check the production plate behind the right front seat.  The top
numbers
are probably 30 8 or thereabouts.
