Subject: re:parcel tray full of water

what used to happen to me with leaky seals-when driving on the highway(or
anywhere) at a high speed the seals "fail" more, due to the pressure of the
wind hitting the windshield. causes more deflection or deformation of the
seal, and then more leaks.

the water could just be coming through the seal, over the dash, and into the
tray. other sources-there are two grommets where the windhsield wiper shafts
go through the front of the bus. if those have problems-water will go
through there.

your problems with the lights not earthing(or grounding as we say in the US)
properly-the screws probably got rusty with the rain water coming in. this
rust is killing the ground.
