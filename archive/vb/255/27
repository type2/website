You are just basically guessing what the timing is if you are only
static timing it. I would highly recommend buying a strobe light &
actually set the timing properly. You can help find out what the
timing should be set to by getting the dist number & looking here:

At idle on a single vacuum dist there is a vacuum signal. By static
timing it you are eliminating that signal & simply not taking it into
account:

Av=vacuum advance
Am=mechanical advance

if total advance (At) is calculated by At=Av + Am and Av is only
non-zero when the engine is running the only way you can set the
timing properly at idle is when Av is > 0. Summary at idle the engine
is already advancing the timing through the vacuum advance unit so
some of the advance has already been used up. By static timing it you
are not allowing the engine to include the vacuum advance in the
timing you are setting.

short of actually monkeying with the units internals I don't think so.
