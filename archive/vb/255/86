Well, to us physics geeks, a dielectric is something you put between the
plates of a capacitor to increase the capacitance.  By definition it has
to be an insulator.

Nope, insulator.

  Does vaseline work just as well?   It's cheaper and

I don't see why not.  the only function of the grease is to keep air out
of the connection so it won't corrode.  I use distributor point grease
myself, since I have a tube of it in the toolbox and it's nice and stiff.
