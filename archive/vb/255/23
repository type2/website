Unless one of the copper windings is broken, the problem is probably the
little arm that is supposed to 'snap' the disk around. I've got some pics of
mine when I was rebuilding it, and can show you some things to look for.
There should be an insulating material halfway up the arm to keep it from
grounding out, also, a small gap should be in place between the arm and the
coil to give it free movement. I'll see if I can get time to load the pics
tonight for you if you would like. I had to rebuild mine because it looks
like the housing filled with water (cracked windshield) and rusted all the
clock innards together. Works great now though!
