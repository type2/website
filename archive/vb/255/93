Subject: Re: [VB] 66 and 67 wiper mechanisms and switches

A 67 motor will fit fine in a 66.   The switch and the wiring and the 
assembly (bracket and shafts etc) are the same. The shape of the motor is the same.  
(like a cylinder)  Only the voltage of the motor has been changed.

  So before installing the new one, remove the cover from the motor that 
hides the grease, and remove the old crusty grease, replace it with clean new 
fresh grease for smoother quieter operation.   ( When I did this to the wiper 
motor in my 61, the old grease came out as a semi solid.   I could stand it on 
end.)  

Look at the ends of the flat black rods, they have a whitish plastic bushing 
in each end.  ( I am assuming you are getting the assembly as well as the 
motor). The hole in the middle of the bushing is supposed to be circular.    If it 
is ovaled the wipers are sloppy.  So check them all, replace any ovaled with 
circles, and grease all moving parts in the linkages.  Get new seals for the 
shafts through the bus.  ya. 

  Make sure the shafts rotate easily before installing, grease is good.

<< After my leaking incident I can see that my wiper mechanism is quite worn, 
and as I am currently running it at 12V even though it is a 6V motor (well it 
is quite fast but not silly fast) I am getting a 67 mechanism as I believe 
this is a straight swap into a 66 and is 12V - this is correct isn't it?
 
 Is there any difference in the wiper switch as well - can I stick with my 66 
switch or should I also get the 67 switch whilst I am at it?
