Subject: Interior light wiring loom Q.

My '67 21 Window doesn't have the rear interior
light installed. I guess the guy that restored it
missed it. I pulled back the headliner behind the
sun roof, and the mounting holes look fine.
I bought a new light, but I need to know how
the wire gets from the switch on the LH side
of the speedo to the light.  That switch is currently
wired in series with the front interior light.

Thanks in advance,
Tom.
