Hi Joel,
Using the engine for braking is an option we have found it is very rarely 
needed (N. entrance to Yosemite, WOW!) as the stock brakes used in bursts will do 
just fine and have time to cool between use.  Plus since brakes are alot 
easier and cheaper to replace we feel that using them instead of the engine is 
better in the long run.  Did you take a look at the Workshop Manual VW 
Transporter, section K-2, page 21, Symptom # 5?  Are you using the vaccum port on the 
left, middle from top & bottom?  What are the jet sizes you are using and size 
of engine, muffler, air cleaner, etc...?  We had a little of the same problem 
with our 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion when we switched from a 010 to 
the 205M distributor we experienced a tad bit of backfiring whenever we 
suddenly pressed the clutch pedal in and coasted from a higher RPM.  With a full 
tune up and fine adjustments to the carb this cleared up completely.  Yes, the 
205M is alot nicer for driving!  Before we used the 205M distributor we did take 
it apart for a good cleaning of all parts and regreasing.  The old grease was 
so sticky the advance would slowly return/crawl back to idle advance point.
