Hi Volks,

I agree with Jason's advice, and would add that at this point a brake 
fluid change is also in order.

When I brought home my 79 westfakia body the brake fluid was black. I 
didn't worry about it at the time because the brakes worked fine, and I 
had lots of other things to take care of. But it wasn't long after that 
the bus suddenly needed a new master cylinder and 2 rear wheel 
cylinders; money I could have saved if I'd spent a few $$ on fluid a 
few months sooner.

YMMV.

Happy trails,
