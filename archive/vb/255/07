Subject: 6v starter needed in So cal

Hi folks,

Been off the list since going to der Fatherland.  Back now and I need a
good 6v starter to start an original motor.  All I have is 12v...can
anyone in OC or L.A. help me out with one that woks even occasionally. 
This is just for starting a motor on the ground.

Thanks!  BTW the trip was fun, even if I only bought one used euro tail
light for 2 Euros.  On the other hand I got confirmation that a box of 6
KDF and old VW lapel pins that my father found over here in a thrift
store were original!  One is an original KDF opening ceremony pin.

I'm sure people have posted trip reports so I won't go into details. 
Germany was very cool although expensive...the people are great too.  I
also indulged my fast side with a few 140 mph runs down the autobahn, 
in a diesel(turbo) no less.  They have tons of hot rod diesels
there...cool! Good to be back though.

Thanks for any help with the starter!

Steve
