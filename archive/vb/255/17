Suggestion: First, add ground wires to your tail lights and spend a
morning cleaning up _all_ the electrical connections on your Bus.  If
that doesn't brighten up your lights enough, consider installing some
brighter incandescent bulbs.  Read the "ANSI Bulb Specifications"
section of http://www.type2.com/library/electris/bulbs.html .
