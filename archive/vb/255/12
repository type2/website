Don't have a pic handy, but
The front hoop attaches to six points
     1. two bolts into the bed at each leg
     2. one bolt into the back of the cab on each leg just before the leg 
exits the bed area

Center & Rear Hoops  - four bolts into the bed, two on each side

The whole thing is then fastened together using the oak slats.
