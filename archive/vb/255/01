The '54 parts manual online ( http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/ )
is in German, English, and French.  The "church key" is illustrated as
item 30 on page 294 and called out on page 299 as a "vierkantschluessel".
Literally, this means "four sided key".

The Doliwa book refers to nipple/bullet turn signals as "wart blinkers"
and fried-egg turn signals as "frog eyes" or "fish eyes".
