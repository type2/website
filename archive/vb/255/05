That sure is a barndoor single cab!  Heck, one could buy the whole 
lot...part out the bays and use the funds to get the single on the road.  I 
even know where Chowchilla is!  Too bad I don't have the funds nor the 
room.  :P

your hands on the steering wheel; listen with the palm of your hand on the 
gear-shift lever; listen with your feet on the floor boards. Listen to the

of rhythm..." - John Steinbeck _The Grapes of Wrath_
