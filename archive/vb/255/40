Subject: re:'65 brake system question

It could be any of the problems you suggested-but based on the storyline,
and what you are actually explaining-Iwould check the connection of the
brake pedal to the master cylinder...there is a return spring in there that
has been known to break(happened to me, i foret the symptoms exaclty-but it
could be what you describe) or more likely given that there is no response
suddenly to your pedal, makes me think that some part ofthe linkage has
broken...
