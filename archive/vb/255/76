 My apertures were restored in 93 I believe, obviously not well enough

holes should I cut out around the hole and let in new metal or is there 
another technique I should use?

well, 10 years ago was ten years ago.  

the first thing I do is get down to bare metal around any rust holes or pits. 
  Wear protective eye and ear gear, and tape off the dash and nearby glass if 
you dont want bits of metal embedded in the glass or scratchingthe paint.  
(guess how I found that out)  If you find small holes, usually they can be 
welded up by filling in with wire feed.  Sometimes the hole gets bigger, as the 
metal is so thin, though.   If you can stick a finger through it gets trickier.   
 I think various vendors sell repro patch pieces, and the center bar from a 
dead bus can be used to patch flat areas.   Hope it is not that bad.  If there 
are not holes, I do zinc rich primer on the bare metal, then fill in with spot 
putty, sand smooth, more primer, sand, paint.   The key thing is to get rid 
of rus, and make a properly smooth painted surface, as new seals can't seal on 
rough rust pits.   You can reach up from underneath to feel for rust.  It may 
not be that bad underneath the old seals.
