Subject: How do I reattach/seal headlight...it wont go!

This morning I replaced the small 5w lamp inside the headlight that turns on
with the switch in the first position. Little did I know what an impossible
job it would be to seal the headlight trim ring back onto the body.  I gave up
after 90 minutes and found you guys.
So what is the trick?  I cannot get the ring to make a decent seal on the
rubber weatherstrip. I have twisted, pushed and begged and it will not go
unless I ditch that seal. I am at my wits end trying to reattach the headlight
on this 'simple' vehicle. Do you have to really horse it and cram it on? I
start by hooking it on the outside(lateral) ear, but the top and bottom won't
go on and seal.
HELP!
