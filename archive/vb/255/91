Subject: RE: [VB] Swing to IRS

My 60 has a 68 IRS rear setup in it. PO handled the install and it looks
factory correct. All of the parts are inexpensive junkyard bounty, but I
hear the labor time was pretty impressive.

If you'd rather do a kit, I'd recommend CE as a high-quality alternative
to Shadetree Welding 101.

I've got the CE "arms" under my 66 now.  I can tell you to make sure you
check everything 3 and 4 times.  I got it square and the distance
between the arm mounts right but ended up with one replacement arm off
level.  This caused the wheel to have negative camber.  I've bought a
set of control arms (69-70 Bus style) with eccentric (spelling?) bushing
that give me enough adjustment to get it out, or at least have both
sides with a very slight negative chamber, like most lowered Buses.
