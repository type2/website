Subject: Odd Turn Indicator Problem

Hey all,

We had a heck of a hot spell here in NorCal last week and I noticed that 
when I drove home in the evening from work my left turn indicator wouldn't 
exactly work.

Here's what *would* happen:
I'd flip the switch, the indicator in the dash pod would blink once, then 
not again.  I could still hear it clicking.  No idea if they were blinking 
on the outside.

The next morning I'd get up, go to work when it was cooler, and they'd be 
working fine.  I don't get it, but wanted to see who had thoughts on the 
subject.

Also, I don't know if they're related, but my 4-way flashers will get the 
knob to blink, but not the lights.  BTW, it's a 67 camper in case you 
wondered about the wiring.

"Listen to the motor. Listen to the wheels. Listen with your ears and with 
your hands on the steering wheel; listen with the palm of your hand on the 
gear-shift lever; listen with your feet on the floor boards. Listen to the 
pounding old jalopy with all your senses; for a change of tone, a variation 
of rhythm..." - John Steinbeck _The Grapes of Wrath_
