Subject: double cab gates needed

Hello,
I`m looking for either a set of gate for a double cab or just a pass, side gate.They dont have to be show quality. I use it as a truck. If I can find just the pass. side than I will also nee 4 of the hinge mounts that mount to the body. Some po drilled out the center pins of the two gates that I have and misplaced the mounts.
Thanks in advance,
Dave Parsons
