Subject: Carburetor Adjustment (specific steps)

Good evening all,
I have a very specific request.  There are a set of
instructions for carburetor adjustment in the orange
Bentley Official service manual that are very good for
setting the air/fuel mixture and then the idle screw
using a tachometer/dwellometer.  Does anyone have
this?  I would love to get those two pages scanned or
even just the step by step instructions for this
specific adjustment.  I was going to buy the book but
it seems a little silly to pay $40.00 for two pages in
a book.  Can anyone help?

Gene
