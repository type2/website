Subject: Parcel tray full of water and dodgy speedo backlights

Having just got my bus back on the road after a mechanical renovation I have
been using it in the wet (in the UK you occasionally get caught in showers)
but tonight I had a long drive at 60mph in driving rain.  When I reached my
destination I found that the entire dash tray was full of water, about half an
inch deep.  I dried this up okay but I need to find the cause of this problem.
I have never used my bus in the rain much before as it had not been properly
rust proofed - I have done this now so I was hoping it would be fine.....

The front windows do leak onto the dash, and I can see small amounts of
surface beneath the seal - but I guess if the parcel tray is full of water
then there must be holes in the window aperture? Or could it just be leaky
seals causing the problem?

I plan to take out the windows in the next month but I want to prepare for
what I might find lurking there.

On a kind of related note, since driving it in the rain a couple of weeks ago
I now find that my speedo back lights do not function correctly - they began
flickering on and off however they are now permanently off.  The fuel gauge
light works fine, and if I remove one of the bulb holders from the speedo and
earth it separately it works fine - therefore I must have an earthing problem.
Thing is I don't know where the speedo should be earthed - is it just through
the two mounting screws?  If so I guess these need replacing - is it possible
to remove these without removing the dash tray?

Thanks
Paul
