Subject: Buses in the Shop 3 (07.19.03)

That's right, folks...you heard it here first.  July 19, 2003 is Buses in 
the Shop 3 over at VolksAuthority in San Jose, CA!  It's a Saturday and 
we'll be there from 8am-1pm.  This is basically a Swap N Shine...not quite 
a Show N Shine, since we don't have awards or judging or anything.  What we 
do have is just a cool, laid-back day of buses, friends, and 
raffle.  There's also no sales tax on purchases at VolksAuthority for that 
day only!  Swappers....since this event takes place in a neighborhood, we 
ask that you limit your swap area to either within or immediately around 
your bus.  This event is free for everyone!

"Listen to the motor. Listen to the wheels. Listen with your ears and with 
your hands on the steering wheel; listen with the palm of your hand on the 
gear-shift lever; listen with your feet on the floor boards. Listen to the 
pounding old jalopy with all your senses; for a change of tone, a variation 
of rhythm..." - John Steinbeck _The Grapes of Wrath_
