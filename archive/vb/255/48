Subject: Middle Seat Help ?

It has been many years since I owned a bay window bus--I am now looking for
a 1966 or OLDER splittie bus, been looking for a while---- Of course all of
them so far are missing the middle seat--I have been told a Bay Window
middle seat will work-- My question is --  I do have the hold down
clamps--But do the legs of a Bay middle seat line up with the holes in the
floor of a splittie Bus-? Is this a straight forward install ? or will there
be modifications ? P-Mail is fine--, uj
