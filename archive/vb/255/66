Hi Kevin,
Actually the interior of the bus stays at normal air pressure, while outside 
the air pressure increases with the higher the speed because the bus is 
pushing through the air much like a boat pushes and creates a bow wave in the water.
  If the water is not dripping down the dash into the package tray you have 
rusted through areas in the window frame.  After you derust, weld, grind down, 
high zinc content primer, paint, do use the roofing tar to seal the window 
seals to both the windscreen glass and to the body!  It does also repels rust and 
reseals once exposed to a sunny warm day if you Baja your VW too much one 
day.
