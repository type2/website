Subject: Re: [VB] Parts ordering experience w/ 4 vendors

I like WW, but I also like type2parts.com.  Ronnie's really good about
knowing what's what, what works, what doesn't, etc, and can get oddball
bits like fulcrum plates and side gears.  The last time I put a large
order in w/BD, bits and pieces trickled in for weeks, a lot of it wrong.
What type2parts.com needs is a better web interface (no offence, Steve)
