Subject: Single vacuum advance distributor advancing too far

Hi all,
I installed a single vacuum advance distributor on my
1641 engine after checking to make sure that the
vacuum worked and that it wasn't sticking.  First I
timed it with a light at about 30 degrees full advance
and found that the engine would retard below 0 degrees
to about -4 at idle.  I figured that couldn't be right
so I followed some advice and static timed it at about
7 degrees but now the full advance is close to 38 - 40
degrees which is way too much for a bus engine, right?
 Anyway, I have a few questions...

1. What would make the distributor advance this far?
2. Is there any way to alter the amount of advance it
gives?
3. When I static timed it, I rolled the engine through
all 4 firing points and it ended up firing anywhere
from 4 to 9 degrees before tdc depending on which one
was firing.  Why would this be and how do I fix it?

Thanks for your help!

PS... I just went through replacing all of the
previous "go fast chrome" engine tin from the PO with
a complete doghouse oil cooler, fan shroud, flaps,
etc. and made certain to cover all holes.  
Thanks for all of the information on engine cooling
that exists in the archives because of all of you. 
There is a gret wealth of knowledge living in this
list.
