Subject: Re: [VB] Parcel tray full of water and dodgy speedo backlights

Don't forget to check your wiper shaft nuts and seals!  BTDT!  If a 
shaft seal is going bad or the outside shaft nut is loose, water will 
drip down the shaft into the cab and right onto the package tray, do not 
pass go and do not collect $200.  Or, the drops of water will travel 
from the shaft along parts of wiring inside the dash and then onto the 
package tray.

The problem of a recurring flooded package tray had me flummoxed (and I 
had just replaced the windshield seals) until I discovered a combination 
of loose wiper shaft nuts and loose old seals were allowing the driving 
rain to sneak in this way, drop by drop.
