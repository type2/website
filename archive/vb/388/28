need to patch some holes in the back floor on a split screen ,

can I cut out a section from a bay window floor for a patch panel ?
Is the profile the same ?

its about 1 foot wide by 2 foot long

thanks for the info



I believe I used flooring from a bay to fix the 67 double cab I worked 
on at transporter werks, and the pattern was the same. I will check the 
buses I have at the shop and post tonight...I'm sure someone will 
confirms this right or wrong before Ii get back.
