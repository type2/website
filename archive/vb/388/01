Poor condition, "a lot of rust", $2000 and a daily driver.

You have to wonder about someone who rates their vehicle as poor but  
uses it as a daily driver, unless they live a couple of blocks from  
work. I'm assuming there is a reason he doesn't show the front of the  
bus. (no safaris?)

I made the mistake buying a bus from an ad that didn't show all sides  
of the bus. Never again.
