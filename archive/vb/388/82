Subject: RE: [VB] Bus dies at stop lights

Well, here's the strangest of strange. I reset the points/dwell, static
timed according to Mr Muir, then was poking around and noticed the "E" stud
wire mount on the generator was loose, so further investigation lead me to
remove the gen pulley and lo and behold, the PO had tried to 'fix' a broken
internal generator wire where it mounts to the stud with elec. Tape. Yikes!
So I resoldered the wire onto the stud's bottom, and fired it right up.
Hmmm, sounds good, so off into the night and no more stalling. The gen light
on the dash was next in line to look at, simple plug in and rewire the gen,
oil, turn signal and fuel gauge to #15 on the ign switch, and now, gen light
comes on with turn of key, goes off when started, fuel gauge works, and no
more stalling.
Thanks to everyone who had input regarding this issue, you folks are so much
appreciated.
Gary
