Subject: Re: [VB] Tuning new Kadrons for the '67 Westy.....

   Call AJ at Low Budget, the Kadron King. I could post my experiences but won't waste yours or anybody elses time, it seems that every set 
of Kadrons I have installed all needed something different. Some needed smaler idles, or bigger airs (remove and drill out), bigger mains, 
lower  float levals, fuel pressure adjustments on and on. I could be your dizzy or even a bad tank of gas!!! I just had a traveler come by the 
shop to change his oil and have me check his timing on a new engine. He had a pulsing problem like you mention at high speed. Changed about 
everything in the fuel system (mind you he, his wife and 1 1/2 year old daughter were with him) and they were going from Georgia to San 
Fran. After all these changes he got desperate, grasping they put a bottle of HEET in the gas tank, PROBLEM SOLVED, it turned out to be a 
bad tank of AS!!!!
