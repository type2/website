Subject: Offset on wide-5 rims: same for 1967 and early bays?

Volks,

Do early-bay wide-5 rims have the same offset as the late splitty rims (64-67)?

One post by Eric&Barb in the archives seems to point to yes, but is not definitive.

From what I've gleaned, splitty 15" rims were 4.5" wide, while splitty 14" rims were 5" wide.  Unfortunately, I know nothing about the early bay wide-5 rims.

Thanks,
   Tom
