Thanks for all the advice and after two days away ....... I think I will 
check the fuel pressure first as when I rev it higher, slight hesitation, 
then black smoke comes out of the exhaust as if it is clearing itself up, 
and then it moves up the rpm range.....

Vacuum leak might be a possibility as well.
