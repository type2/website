Subject: Tuning new Kadrons for the '67 Westy.....

Idle mixture seems correct, idles nice, accelerates with no 
hesitation....... but holding the engine at constant speed creates a bit of 
roughness/pulsation.... also can be felt at speed.

All on 1600 cc DP w/ported heads, Dual QPs, 009 and stock fuel pump w/rod at 
prescribed 5mm. Ideas...
