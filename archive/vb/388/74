Subject: I'm Baaaack!!! Now need an engine

Howdy Y'all!
Well, its been a helluva summer. Back in May I started
a new job, uprooted my entire family and moved to a
new city. Shortly after that I sold my bus (although I
swore I NEVER would) and my wife's Ghia in order to
buy a house. I went the entire summer without driving
a bus or going to a campout or posting to hardly any
of the bus lists.  I just about crawled out of my
skin!!!! But, I am now back.  I am currently living in
Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio near Akron. We are completely
moved into our new house (it has a nice size garage)
and just this past weekend I acquired another a bus. I
picked up a 60 bus with a faded mango paint job from a
guy near Toledo. The "Mango Tango" is a little rough,
will require some welding and painting, but is all
there and I honestly am confident that I will be
camping in it by Spring '07. Woo freakin Hoo!!  So
anyway, I am looking for a running 1500 or 1600 engine
for it.  I have a ton of bay window parts I can use as
a partial trade on a decent engine (including 1500
heads, a 71 Westy stool, and misc other bits).  So has
anyone got a decent running engine for sale? I will
drive up to a couple or few hours for a good deal.

Peace, John Baker
