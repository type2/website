Subject: Jerome Jamboree Model Bus Sale

Magoo, my most needed, companion, partner, savior, lover, and much
appreciated wife, will have a LOT of bus models for sale at this Jerome. We
are slowly selling off our collection. I am sure I will not live long enough
to see it all go, but hopefully this Jerome, Magoo will be able to thin it
out, uj, Bless you and thanks
