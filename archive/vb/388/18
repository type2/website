So what listees will be heading out?  I love Familienfest because it is about 30 minutes from me - so if anyone is long haulin' it out the show, feel free to p-mail if you need a spot to camp or clean up on Thursday or even early Friday.
   
  I'll head out after Clara gets out of school on Friday.  Will be in the swap area in a Beige 79 Westy with splitty parts for sale.
