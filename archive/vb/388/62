Subject: block heaters

After that post about the block heaters, I did a search at the samba. 

How exactly do these work? I imagine I bolt this right under the sump plate,
or is it just attached with magnets?

If I bolt it on, what happens to the cord while driving do you need to tie
it up to the bumper or something? Or is it detachable?

How well do they work?

Thanks for any tips, info, advice.
