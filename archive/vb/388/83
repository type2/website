Beleza manos

I have made an easy and cheap way to help you to see traffic lights at
intersections. It works better at night, but can be used at day, depending
at sun position. It is a simple roud mirror with self double face adesive
tape in the back, witch i atachet one magnet from a metal picture wall
board. That way a can just put it wherever i want to make it more visible. I

tthink it doesn4t work as perfect as "lighinsight.com" but is just another
way.
