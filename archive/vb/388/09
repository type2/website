Subject: Re: [VB] Tuning new Kadrons for the '67 Westy.....

 The air correction jets in Kadrons are not removable!  There should be no
reason to change or modify the air correction jets anyway!  He said he can
accel and idle just fine so i believe he is describing a vacuum leak which is
very possible with the manifolds hitting the head tin and not seating
correctly causing an air leak.  Check for a vacuum leak!

He has a very mild motor and the carbs should work right out of the box with
minimal adjustments to the air fuel adjusting screws!  I have Kadrons on both
a 2017 and a 1904 with only main jet changes in each.
