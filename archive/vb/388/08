Sounds  like you need bigger main jets.


Hi John,
If he was having problems with acceleration in the lower RPMs that would  
probably be it.  He mentions "can be felt at speed", we guess that means at  
higher RPMs.  If so that means he needs smaller air correction jets to keep  them 
from leaning out the mixture so much.  Just putting in bigger main jet  can 
result in too much fuel at lower RPMS and ruining the  piston rings.
