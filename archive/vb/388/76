I have made an easy and cheap way to help you to see traffic lights at 
intersections. It works better at night, but can be used at day, depending 
at sun position. It is a simple roud mirror with self double face adesive 
tape in the back, witch i atachet one magnet from a metal picture wall 
board. That way a can just put it wherever i want to make it more visible. I 
tthink it doesn4t work as perfect as "lighinsight.com" but is just another 
way.

Have you guys seen this.helps you to see traffic lights at intersections.
 I'm not that tall, and given the overhang and the seat height, sometimes I
 need to crane my neck to see the light at certain intersections.

 This might be useful.
