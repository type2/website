Subject: Help Getting rear drum off?

What am I doing wrong?  Doing new brakes on my 65 Deluxe Westy? which has
not been driven in 10-12 years.  No problem getting drums off except for
right rear.  Big nut came off easily, drum turns easily, but won't come off
even w/ a drum puller/PB Blaster for 2 weeks, etc.

Any advise?

TIA,

Tom B.
