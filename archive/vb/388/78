One simple thing to do is to use a long extension cord and loop the
cord through the driver's door handle.  I used to do this when I had to
keep a battery charger on some fire trucks - somebody other than me might
have to drive one at a moment's notice, and we tended to have to buy
fewer new battery chargers and cord ends if they unplugged them before
driving off.  :)  If the weather is nice (more likely in the battery
charger case than the sump heater case), an even better way is to open
the driver's window and loop the extension cord through the steering
wheel.
