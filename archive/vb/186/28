Subject: Re: [VB] using a cyl head temp sensor for oil temp?

it has a hole for an oil pressure sender ; i have a 2.0 L head temp
sensor 
that fits this hole (bosch 0 280 130 012)
-----------------------------
Interesting thinking.
I tend to think that the sensor just sends a fixed signal of off or on.
The sender on the other hand must send a signal across a wide span of
temperatures.
At any rate you can add resistors to senders to get the results you need
for a gage if you know the base and umtimate temperature range.
