Subject: Switches for a '67

Volk-a-maniacs,

We are in need of some switches.  Our Headlight switch fizzled smoked and now
doesn't work.  Does anyone have a good source for these parts?  'Good'
meaning... reasonably priced.  We are located in the Portland Oregon area but
are willing to receive if shipped from elsewhere.

We are also in need of a Turn Signal assembly.  Our current one is spinning
around the steering column, stripped out from the many adjustments over the
years.  If there is only a collar and innards replacement alternative, we
would love to entertain that as well.  Does anyone have a 'good' source for
these parts?

Thanks in advance for your help and we look forward to seeing you on the
roads.
Greg & Dan
