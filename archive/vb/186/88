Subject: Re: [VB] 50MPH Whine--??

Hmmmm,

My whines a bit too, just about at identical speeds to those described 
by Jerry.  
It's not a horrendous whine  - its a slight but noticeable whine that is 
not
there at other speeds.  But apart from that the tranny  is smooth AND  
smooth shifting.......it was rebuilt (by moi - I have the tools for 
setting and measuring R&P backlash)..

All rebuilt reduction boces with good gears and new German bearings.....

A very experienced tranny builder here said this often happens.  He claimed
that when you re-adjust the R&P to factory specs (ie take some of the slop
out of it) the ring and pinion are taken out of their 'established' wear 
pattern
and that some noise results....I am sort of waiting to see whether they  
'wear in'
again...............
