It's a variable resistor.  The Digifant box probably used it with a
pull-up resistor to a regulated voltage (creating a voltage divider)
and ran the resulting voltage into an A/D converter.  An electrical
temperature gauge does the same thing, except it sends the voltage
to a meter instead of an A/D converter.

If you just want to use the sensor to do spot checks on the oil
temperature, you can calibrate it with a thermometer, an ohm meter,
and something hot.  Heat up the sensor+thermometer until you hit
the top oil temperature you expect, measure the resistance from
terminal to case, and write that number down.  As it cools down,
measure the resistance again every few degrees.  You'll end up
with a chart of resistance vs. temperature that you can refer to
in the future.

For using it while driving, it would be better to have a dedicated
gauge.  You'd have to find a gauge that is designed to work with the
resistance of that sensor.  Looking at the instruction sheet for a
VDO gauge kit,
http://www.vdona.com/Tech%20Support/Automotive/instructionsheetspdffiles/0%20515%20010%20396%20--%20Instrument%20Kit.pdf ,
the sensor for the temperature gauge in that kit goes from 700 ohms
cold to 68 ohms at 180 F.  You _might_ be able to make your sensor
work with this gauge by putting another fixed resistor in parallel
with the sensor.  If you use 972 ohms of resistance, the combination
of sensor and fixed resistor will be 700 ohms "cold".  _If_ the sensor
goes to 73 ohms at 180 F, then the gauge will read correctly at 180 F.
The scale on the gauge might not be totally accurate when doing this -
it would still be a good idea to calibrate the sensor and gauge as
above.

Another way would be to get a cheap analog multimeter with a 3K or
maybe 5K ohms range and make up a new scale card for it, marked in
degrees.
