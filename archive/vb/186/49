I'm sure AAA can open the door! Call your DMV and ask
about Lien proceedures for vehicles. I think if you
try to notify the last owner and file a lien against
it you can get a title after a given amount of time. I
would be leary of the tow company however, they could
probabily do it too, and then charge you for the car
after all the paperwork clears! Don't tell the city
about it eaither, they can have it towed too. I think
that is how you do it, but I never have so....Now that
I thinkof it a mall would be private property too!
