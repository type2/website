I like the Scion CCX or whatever it is called but rename the boxy second
offering as "maxfugly". If I wanted stark engineering and boxy looks then I'd
go for the old-old school Land Rover Dormo, the Land Cruiser F55 "Pig" or the
86-91 VW Vanagon Synchro all done up in overly outfitted SA Expedition
equipment. Each to their own. I concede that modern technology is great but I
simply dont like the looks.
