Well, kind of 4WD.  Nice for snow, not for real off-road use.  Ground
clearance is only 7 inches, generous for a car, not much for off road.

Well, that's EPA highway.  I figure it'll do a bit better than my bus.  Of
course, with 500 pounds more weight and 100 extra horsepower that is a
considerable improvement.

$21,000 plus about $2000 "additional dealer profit" markup, most likely.

I figure they'll make about five of those.  No radio, no air, no sales.

Unfortunately, it is a lot smaller inside than a bus, which has pretty
much the same footprint.  Gotta have that crush zone!

Their marketing is silly though.  They're so desparate for the "Gen Y"
male 16-25 that they are marketing this thing as a "rolling dorm room" as
if that is a good thing.  What they don't realize is that the gen Y males
don't have enough money to buy the thing!  I think they'll sell quite a
few even with the bad marketing.
