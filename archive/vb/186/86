Hi Ronnie,
We in our 1963 SC had the same problem.  We took the fuel outlet tube and 
filter sock out and rammed a long screwdriver in and spun in a funnel shape 
through the varnish.  Installed fuel outlet tube and new filter sock and 
drove it.  The new fuel slowly dissolved and removed the varnish over the 
next two years.  Definitely gave a stink to the exhaust, but worked!  Had to 
run a filter before the fuel filter and after to remove all the rust flakes.
