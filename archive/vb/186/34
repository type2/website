Subject: RE: [VB] whats this wheel?

I would have guessed Rostyle ('SA sprinstar') looking too
- but Rostyles are a steel wheel.  This looks like its (weathered)
alloy?

Pretty interesting looking wheel.  From first glance from the semi poor
photo, it looks like a south african sprint star... or 'kestral' or
something similar to that... I'm still waiting to put a set like that in my
collection....
