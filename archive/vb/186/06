Tom, distributors have their curve set to match the power to weight ratio of
a given vehicle on the OEM distributors that come stock. When you buy one
off the shelf, like the 009, 050, or SVDA, you get a generalized curve
ratio. A given 009 when swapped in my trike or SC will react different
because of the differing power requirements. Likewise, if I use a 205x that
was stock on a bug in my truck their will be a difference. Same with the
T-3/T-4 distributors.

What is the difference between a bug and a bus distributor?  I noticed the
reference guide at www.oldvolks.com shows different Bosch and VW numbers for
distributors for a 1500 etc..

Enjoy your day!
