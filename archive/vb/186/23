I've been using a simple 12-16" range hook-to-eye turnbuckle, about $12
from McMasters. Hook on one end goes under edge of spring plate, eye gets
bolted into upper shock absorber hole, using shock's bolt. Turn
turnbuckle, and spring plate lifts nicely into place to attach  redux box
bolts. Grease turnbuckle threads before use!
