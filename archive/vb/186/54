Easy now Jim!  We wouldnt' want you to get all worked up or anyting.  
Besides, you know you love your job and would hate to be gone doing all those 
things!  You're just feeling the withdrawals of missing your '67 Westy 
RFH!!(bus content).  Fat Tire??  Naw, now-a-days it's Sol or Caguama, or the 
ol' stand-by 'Dos XX'.  You need to relax under a bus and have some brake 
fluid drip on you for a while.  Yeah! That's it!!
