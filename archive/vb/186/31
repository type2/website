Subject: using a T3 cooler in an upright

as an adjunct to my temp sender question...
when i installed the tight-fin T3 cooler, i had to be careful what 
seals i used; also, the original mount to the CASE required the use 
of some thick aluminum spacers to prevent seal crush and oil 
starvation.

i found that when mounting the cooler to the doghouse ADAPTER, using 
the green seals (111-198-029) instead of the orange (or red or black, 
for that matter) was necessary... and indeed, figure 12-2  page 17 
ENGINE in my T3 book shows how the seals work. the manual says to 
throw away the aluminum spacers when using these seals; i found that 
this caused the cooler to torque down too far on the apex of the 
mounting 'triangle ' so i took what looked like a valve stem seal and 
placed it on that bolt, between the cooler and the mount. this worked 
pretty well. pressurized the assembly to 60 psi and the seals didn't 
leak.
