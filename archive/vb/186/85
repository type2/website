Subject: Re: [VB] 50MPH Whine--??

I say the whine is most likely from the ring & pinion. My tranny had 
very little whine prior to rebuilding it. I wanted to put in the 
freeway flyer r & p. I did and still am doing the job myself. I love a 
challenge. When I put in the new r & p, the tranny whined from 45 mph 
to 55 mph. I did not rebuild the Reduction boxes. The tranny whine 
seems to decrease (or increase) with the adjustment of the pinions 
shims and differential shims. I am currently disassembling my tranny to 
re-adjust the backlash (changing the differential shims) and hopefully 
further reduce the whine.
