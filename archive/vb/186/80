So would the tank from the 57 bus have solder sealing the seams? I think I'm
gonna have to go with a hot tank at the local metal specialties and
re-paint. The local radiator shops won't touch it and when I called the
folks at por-15 a bit ago they didn't sound very confident in their own
products ability to remove the varnish build up.
