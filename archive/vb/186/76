Go buy youself a gallon of Berryman's Chemdip at your local flaps.  This is
stinky, nasty stuff, but if you let is sit for a few days in your tank, it
WILL dissolve the hardened sludge.  I used it on my '59 ragtop and worked
like a charm.  After the goop was dissolved, I rinsed it and put it a 1/10
mix of pool acid/water to get rid of any surface rust.  Total cost: $10.
