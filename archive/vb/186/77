Subject: frame sections

Hi All,

Two people so far have emailed me with offers of frame sections that could
potentially replace the rotten sections on the v80... it's actually only
about 8" forward of the I=beam cross member that the heater tube welds to
that needs to be replaced.  Several have suggested that I replace a bit more
on each side of the rotten part.  The rest of the frame is in good shape.
The two frame sections being offered at the moment are from a 60 and a 66...
mine is a Jan.6, 64 bus.  Will either one work?

While I'm at it, I thought I would put out an APB on a few metal pieces for
both sides of a 64 single cab:
- rear portion of dog leg and rear portion of inner wheel well.
- lower rear cab section (that 4" wide piece of metal)
- front section of bed area in front of treasure chest door.
- front jack points.
- drivers side cab floor section
- nice clean front bulk head cargo area metal

other missing items:
- spare tire support (I have the wing nut and other bracket)
- treasure chest lock bezel
- engine lid lock bezel
- pass. side rubber buffer for under seat.
- drivers side seat cover, gray.  (currently saltnpepper which I'll use to
replace the trashed one in the tipper)
- muffler dampner pipe.
- clear fuse box cover (8 fuse holder)
- 10 door panel buttons... early ones that are more flat and not chrome (or
at least compared to the tipper)
- 1 euro rear tail light lens.

On a similar note, I spoke with Bob at BBT this morning about the cracked
frame and he said this is common among ruthmann options on busses.... it
seems the vw just wasn't designed for the weight and force exerted by the
whole thing.  I think I'll put some reinforcements when the new sections go
in to ensure a nice long life to come.
