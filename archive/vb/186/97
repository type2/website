Subject: RE: [VB] Tent question

I have a hardtop deluxe, and in the same situation. Although pricey (not
compared to an NOS side tent tho), eurocampers.com has some AWESOME side
tents, new german stuff. Plan on purchasing one this spring for use on
the eurovan and the splitty.
AL


I have a '67 deluxe and would like to road trip in it, I was curious if
anyone on the list has any suggestions for tents that would make a trip
more enjoyable, I'm not looking for originality just functionality.
    Thanks for your help,
Tim Johnson
