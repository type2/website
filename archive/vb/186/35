Subject: type 3 parts compatibility

well since my '67 squareback is totalled, i have it sitting in my
driveway...contemplating what to do with it...basically strip it for parts
is what coems to mind. i am wondering what parts on this are compatible with
my bus-or are they compatible with any other type of vw.

specifically the engine-which is in pretty good shape...

is there a site that details compatibilty between aircooleds?
