Subject: Re: [VB] Abandoned VW

Has anyone ever "acquired" a vehicle this way?  Any tips?  Oh, and the
doors are locked...
------------------------------
You need written permission from the property owners. They have first
rights of salvage on the abandoned vehicle.
It could belong to someone that works in one of the stores.
The local police can get you and address of the owner from the last
license plates.
It might be a freebie if you contact them.
