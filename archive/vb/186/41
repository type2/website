Maybe VW will take the hint and follow suit as most auto manufacturers do .
But they are VERY slow bringing cars to market, I mean look at them, they
are just NOW coming out with an SUV as the goverment is ready to clamp down
on them, forward thinking!!

I hate these over-Flashed websites!  If you want to see the Scion that
looks like a Fridolin you have to click the fourth thumbnail inset in the
picture.

A better picture is at:

I would expect the low skirts to disappear before this one hits the
showrooms.

I personally prefer the Honda Element:

Which is a lot closer to introduction (December) and has a lot of the
features that have endeared my bus to me (flat, washable floors, tall
stance, decent ground clearance, relatively stark engineering)  Pity that
VW cannot produce something like this any more!
