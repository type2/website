Subject: RE: [VB] Tent question

Years ago, like the eighties, I had an 83 Vanagan GL and wanted to camp with
it. I found that Sears had a flat face tent that fit right up to the sliding
door and the front flap was folded around flat magnet strips and laid over
the top of the van where it stuck. The other side of the tent had a door in
it also which made it a great walk through for under $250. It saved a ton of
motel money for two weeks 7 state vacation we took.

I have a '67 deluxe and would like to road trip in it, I was curious if
anyone on the list has any suggestions for tents that would make a trip
more enjoyable, I'm not looking for originality just functionality.
    Thanks for your help,
