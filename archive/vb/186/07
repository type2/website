It could be different bulbs, incorrect wiring, or bad connections.  Look
at the front glass of the bulbs and see if they are the same make.  Does
one say "halogen" and the other not?

Check the wires from the high beam relay to the fuse box.  At the fuse box,
the white wire should split out to two fuses with two more white wires, and
the yellow wire should split out to two fuses with two more yellow wires.
If the white wire splits out to a white and a yellow wire, the connections
have gotten swapped around.

They can also get mixed up on the back of the headlights.  Normally the
wires are in a molded plug, but sometimes they aren't.  It's also possible
for someone to splice a replacement plug on incorrectly.  Compare the left
and right headlights for any differences and correct them if found.  Also
look for the lamp type number stamped on the back; should both be 6006
or 6012.

A bad connection can show up as corrosion, or as heat at the bad connection
after the headlights have been on for a little while.  If you take the
headlights out, don't forget to check the ground wire inside the headlight
bucket.
