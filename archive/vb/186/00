Subject: 88mm cylinder needed

anyone out there have a NEW Mahle machine-in 88mm cylinder for sale or trade?
long shot i know, but i busted a fin on my set, and would like to 
replace it if possible.

otherwise, anyone have any success repairing broken cast iron :)


btw - when checking deck height, make SURE that the deck plate marked 
92 is really a 92 and NOT a 94  :P
