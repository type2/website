Subject: Re: [VB] Nasty Dusty

Actually, I like to drive remote dirt roads too, but this dust FILLS the
engine compartment!  Yes, it is worse where there are oil leaks or spills,
but there's enough actual dust to coat everything pretty good even after one
run up this drive.  It's more dusty than many roads I've driven, including
the long miles of gravel and dirt that are on the last leg of the Shasta
trip.

The problem is exacerbated by the fact that the DC intake vents are much
lower, outies, and right behind the rear wheel!

I pulled the shroud off earlier this year to see if dust was accumulating on
the oil cooler, but it was fine, as were the fins of the cyliders and heads.
I once had a beaten beater dune buggy (Max) years ago, and when the engine
barely ran, I pulled it out and took it apart, only to find 3/4" of dirt and
oil plastered to the leading edge of the oil cooler!  I can't imagine why
that engine died!  (Type 3, I think)
