Subject: turn signal switch for 65 bus

Yikes! the insides of my turn signal switch fell apart and is broken 
into many little pieces. I need a replacement to be legal and safe, not 
to mention a desire to have a fully operating bus in good condition. 
Does anyone know where I can buy one? Thanks for your help.
Dave
