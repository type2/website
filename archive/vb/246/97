Hot wiring test was successful.  I taped over the burnt through places on 
the wire.  Now to get a new switch.  Someone mentioned taking the switch 
apart....  I dont see any screws, guess I could pry it apart.  Now I gotta 
order a new ignition switch.  Can any locksmith rey-key it?  I don't want my 
ignition being different than my doors.  In the mean time I guess I will rig 
up a 3 stage switch or maybe a switch and a button.  Till the new one comes.

Thanks,

Bart
