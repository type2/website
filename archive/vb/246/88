In my nonwalkthrough I keep all of that in a small box that's tucked into
the spare tire wheel.  It's high enough to keep away from pooling water
and far enough from the bad door seals to stay dry. :)

I've found that cops frown on keeping these papers in the back...they
don't like you to rummage around outside of the cab while they stand
waiting for you.
