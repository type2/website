Subject: Oregon Questions

   Sorry for being kinda off topic, but remeber that resume disaster I 
mentioned in my smoke rant.  Anyway I have a couple of prospective jobs in 
OR, closer to CA that IN......  So one being in Portland and the other is in 
Roseburg.  Any of you listees live near these places or know anything about 
them?  What VW clubs are there and what kind of VW scene is there.  What's a 
gallon of gas cost there?
