seeing as autos and long haul trucks do much more damage to the roads per mile driven, is it reasonable to expect bicyclists to pay ?  Then again, most people who bike also drive, so that's how they pay for the roads.

I used to bike around town most all the time, and only drove pretty much at night or going out of town.  The guy who owned the local VW shop saw me biking and asked if the bus was broken. I said no,if it was broken I'd have been in there buying parts.
