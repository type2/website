Never been there but I do know of the South Oregon VW
club.
A friend called Dave Timmins is a member & I'd happily
get you info if the situation arises.
They accept all sorts....air AND water cooled.
A sensible move although I'm sure there are those who
would disparage the owners of the modern products of
VWAG, simply because VWoA's attitude toward the
aircooled crowd is so poor.
SOVW have had a few big club meets already this year &
the club is growing.
Let me know if you're interested.
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
