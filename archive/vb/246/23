Subject: Reely Stoopid Oil Question

How does one pour oil into the stock oil tower without either going really
slow, or spilling it all over the frickin' place?

I always pull the dipstick out a bit to allow the air to escape, and sometimes
it just glugs right on in, and sometimes it backs up and makes a mess.

Duh?
