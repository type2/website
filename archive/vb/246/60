Greeting Bus Brothers,

I like to use hemp oil with a little bit of patchouli oil thrown in for good measure.  I think the oil karma keeps my temps down, and I have never had a problem while following the Phish tours.

I take off alot of tin to let more air in, along with my custom scoops.

Oh man...it's 4:20 I gots ta go.

Peas out,

Beto
