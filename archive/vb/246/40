about the ir guns. I borrowed a decent one from work & am looking at
it right now. the spread on it is nothing like you remember eric. Mine
says 1.5" at 12" distance. So it is more accurate than you think, that
being said. it's just external temps, so take it w/ a grain of salt. I
do find it funny that that rag keeps flip/flopping on the synth topic.
one month it talks about how bad synth is then next its the greatest
thing since sliced bread. But then again if you believe everything you
read......
