Subject: brosol H30/31 rebuild kit

Anyone know where I can get a rebuild kit for my brosol H30/31?  I pulled it
off the engine last night and it is pretty dirty.  I am guessing that it has
not had any attention since it was installed.  I figured that I might as well
throw some new gsakets at it while have it apart for cleaning.  Hints, tips,
suggestions?
