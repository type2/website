Subject: RE: [VB] pre-heat

My tipper came with that piece of tin... and Matthew Henricks from this
list saw it in the pics and immediately told me he *needed* it.  After
sometime, and I realized the tipper didn't need it, we worked out a
trade.  Another positive outcome of this list... sorry you didn't get
there first!

Sean sighed:
Tell me about it! I have been looking for that clip that holds the
pre-heater tube for a few years!
