Subject: RE: [VB] Euro wiring harness q's

Euro wiring (indicators separate to tailight/stoplight)
actually have two 'extra' wires that run to the
rear light assembly (compared to US wired busses)...

Just be aware that if you replace the whole thing with a US
harness you will be two wires short.

1.  Yank harness and replace with readily available US spec harness, kluge 
together wiring to make 3 wire TS work.
