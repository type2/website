  We all know that VW Trends sucks but in the latest issue they did have a
good? test on oil and synthetic won, except they claim oil leaks from it
which I do not have on mine with 15/50 Mobil 1 and in all my other engines I
use 30 weight Vavoline racing in the winter and 40 weight in the summer and
it's 110 here right now!

Someone had has said that I should put my reasons for asking the question
about the oil.

Basically a local store has Havoline 20/50 at 25 cents a quart.
I'm thinking about buying what's left..  (about 20-30 quarts)...

is it a 'buy it now' situation?

I'm sure that this has been covered at some point but I just need opinions
about using various oil grades
What do people think about using 10-30 or 20-50 oil?
any pros, cons, don'ts, do s?
