Subject: Help .............. Vanagon Parts

Thanks to all that have purchased parts.
I've got my garage full of paper bags full of parts with shipping labels
stapled to them in an effort to keep things organized.
Lots of little pieces to keep up with.
I've gone back and numbered each item picture since I had so many similar
items.
Thanks again .................. things are pretty cluttered right now but
I'll get all the list members items shipped before I put the balance on E
bay.
I'm up to about 9 pages now with more to come as the sunlight favors
photography.

Thanks again.
Stan Wilder
