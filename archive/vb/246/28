 I think I know what it is but I'm a bit confused as to where to install it. 
The air-cleaner hangs on the left on the '64, the right on the '67. Does 
anyone have a picture of the piece for the opposite side?

th othr side pre heat pick up is exactly a mirror image

67 bugs came with one on each side.

the pre heat pick up did not always sit on the same side as the air cleaner, 
though.  That's why the tube is so long
