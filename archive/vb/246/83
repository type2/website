When I have to drive a lot of dirt roads I run a piece of flex duct from
the "hot air" inlet of my air cleaner up to the cooling air inlet,  On my
'71 this is all the way up to the top of the bus, but even splitties can
benefit from the cleaner air at the louvers.  There's nothing I've found
to stop dust from seeping into the engine bay past the seals.  My
air cleaner thermostat is disabled so the "hot air" inlet is always open.
