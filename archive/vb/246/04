I've heard from Matt and Harry, thanks for the help.  I went to Lowes on 
Sunday and hung out on the hardware isle for an hour or so and came up wiht 
a mirror hanger that needed one more hole drilled in it to work.  I bought 
some nuts, bolts and washers 5mm and went home to try it out.  The mirror 
hanger worked great, but the threads on the rod go the opposite way and none 
of my new hardware was working. so I got it in place as best I could and 
used some old acc cable to hold it in place just in case.  I drove about 50 
miles yest w/o problem.  So my replacement is working, but I really need a 
new one.  Anyone else know of a source for the backward threaded "heim" 
joint pictured.  They come with the new EMPI weber 34 ICT carbs.

Thanks,

Bart
