Subject: I finally did it... Engine is in and she purrs again!!!

Yippy!

We got the '74 1600-DP engine into the '63 Sundial 'Annie' bus.  After
swapping the glass pack thing the PO had on there with the crummy muffler from
the '74 bug, it sounds a little better too.  I took it out for the maiden
voyage just minutes ago and she did wonderfully.  I got it up to about 50+MPH
and it felt pretty good.

Only thing of concern is that it backfires a little when I let off the gas or
shift down for the oncoming red light.  Nothing too loud of obnoxious, but its
there.  Any thoughts on directions to go with it?

I plan to have the bus at the Woodburn, OR meet this weekend and then at the
Emory farm the following weekend.  Hope to see some of the listees there.
Actually, most of all, I hope to see me there... I am still a bit nervous
about my first engine swap.

Thanks for the list support and I look forward to tapping the list knowledge
base in the future.
