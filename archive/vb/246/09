For those of you who have never heard, or have forgotten. type2.com
has a small irc server setup which allows real time communication for
those of us who don't seem to think that email is quick enough ;)

it's at irc.type2.com channel #buslist

it's usually pretty durn slow, but every once in a while there are
several people on. consider this your very own personal invite 
<insert name here>
