Subject: RE: [VB] Reely Stoopid Oil Question

A lot of those air problems when pouring oil into the hard to get to oil tower
is caused from a really dirty clogged up oil baffle. I've seen a bunch of
clogged oil tower baffles and always wondered how they ever got any oil into
the engine at all!

How does one pour oil into the stock oil tower without either going really
slow, or spilling it all over the frickin' place?

I always pull the dipstick out a bit to allow the air to escape, and
sometimes
it just glugs right on in, and sometimes it backs up and makes a mess.

Duh?
