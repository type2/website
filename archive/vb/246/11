Subject: We made it!!! Pt. 2 was [VB] AIRS Rescue - Drum needed 

The next morning we got up late at 0600 and went to work looking for parts
and deals.  About 0900 JJ found a fellow who had two drums that he thought
were
for 1968-70 bus, two IRS bus sized stub axles of different lengths, and a
swapper who was selling a 1964-67 bus tranny let us pop off one of the axle
nuts
for free!  (Boy, JJ can really sniff out the parts!)  So, we scrambled to let

everyone else who was looking for parts for us know so they wouldn't waste
anymore of their show day!

  We bought a VW key pin for $10.00 from Gabriel the key guy.
  A 1967 bug owners manual, a 1962 Clymers bus manual and what appears to be
a 1957 bus owners manual missing the cover and some water damage, all for
$10.00.  A sandwich bag full of interior knobs and collars for $5.00. 
A rare VDO 1955-60ish bus accessory fuel gauge as seen in Technical Bulletin
K6 for $5.00.
  A VDO cylinder head temp gauge for $10.00. 
A 1953-67 bug/KG locking glove box latch for a buck. 
10 VW original keys of various key codes, two pairs and a single of these
appear unused with matching codes stamped on them and the others seem to have

some wear on them, all for $2. 
Two very hard to find stock early to mid sixties metal tubes, one for from
the fuel pump to the carb and the other from the carb to the vaccum advanced
distributors, both for $4.00. 
Four new Omega EIS H-4 halogen head light assemlies for $7.00 each which up
here it would cost you more just to buy the halogen 55/60 watt bulbs at FLAPS

in our area. 
A new in the box Bigie H-4 halogen head light assembly for a buck that the
guy had bought years before for a bus, but never installed. 
113 905 205 M distributor for a buck.
Eric found a stack of cool rugs 3'x2' shaped and colored like a Green/White
split screen bus with surfboard on top and bought one for $20.00.  Whereupon
seeing, Barb worried about spending so much on such a silly item, but just
had
to have a second one!  (you can't buy a present for one bus and not get
something for the other bus too!  They get fussy if you do)  Unfortunately
Barb got
rid of the tags to these or we would post the source!

We talked to Thom who was selling stuff and it turned out he had been in his
back yard when we had called his place both times.  We had not left our phone

number because we thought Dan had got Wendy's cell phone number out on the
lists and our home number was on the AIRS list so we could retrieve messages
from
it.  Joel from the AIRS list did leave us a message, but by that time we
thought we had the parts needed.  Also saw Jon & Rachel from the vintagebus
list. 
Steve & Michelle from up in our neck of the woods were there and many other
old VW friends.

Barb had wanted to head out at 10:00am (still scared and over stressed Eric
would be late for work and lose that all important job!!!!!!!) and Eric
wanted
no earlier than 12:00pm.  Barb previously at most VW events and all
Sacramentos had the swap space to tend to and a day there seemed to take
forever.  So
she was suprised how fast 10:30 came when walking around looking for
bargains. 
11:30 she and Wendy loaded up the bus and at 12:10 off we went.  Refueled at
the Arco just West of the raceway (Took on 15.002 gallons for $25.59 and got
20.9972 MPG at odometer reading 88040.), and made our way to I-5 and North we

went with a 20-30 MPH wind at our back.  Got to Weed, CA about 1730 (5:30PM)
about 1-1/2 hours before Barb thought we could get there (that tail wind
really
helped!).  The RR axle nut now easily came off with a wrench, so the
estimated
30 minutes just to chisel through the axle nut was not needed.  When we had
first tried it, must have been so hot from friction that it had swelled so it

did not thread off.  Once again, Wendy and Barb each dug into their bus for
piles of tools and parts as the fellas called for them.  (Wendy is especially

quick at finding that all important grease!)  Loosened the lug bolts, jacked
up
and jack standed that corner of the bus.  Adjusted brake stars to closed
position, pulled off the wheel and drum.  JJ unbolted the CV joint from the
stub
axle.  Slid in the new stub axle and rebolted the CV joint back in place. 
Greased
splines of new brake drum and slid it onto the new stub axle.  Greased up the

lugbolts.  Then Eric tried to file a thread chaser out of a spare lug bolt
that Barb had picked at Sacramento for free.  It worked, but slowly.  Barb
suggested using the battery cable clamp cleaner tool to clean out the rusty
threads.  That worked better and soon all five bolts were holding the wheel
on, and
adjusted the brake stars back outward.  Dropped the bus back on the ground
and
properly torqued the lug bolts to 85Ft. Lbs. and the axle nut to 30MKG
(253ft.
lb.) with our original Matra torque wrench.  Total job took 1 hr 15 min.

Wendy&JJ were to head back to Redding to pick up an early Toyota engine for a

collector in Washington, and were planning to drive up the coast on HW-101. 
We said our goodbyes and took off in our opposite ways.  Refueled in Ashland
again, took on 12.945 gallons for $19.40 and got 23.79297 MPG at odometer
reading 88348.  We drove on till about 2245 (10:45PM) when we got to the
Seven
Feathers casino past Roseburg, Ore and got to bed about 2315 (11:15PM).  Got
up at
0630, and went into the casino.  Barb wanted to try her luck at the nickel
slot machines, and limit her losses to $5.00 (100 nickles).  (our previous
trip
through cost her $35.00 on a nickel machine and she didn't want to repeat
that!)   Eric went with her to watch the catastrophy happen.  Barb at first
would
only bet a nickle at a time and lost more than won.  Then she offered Eric to

take turns punching the buttons.  Eric pushed the button for three nickles at

a time and soon was pushing five, six and lastly nine at a time to get it
over
quicker.  We got down to $2.35 (47 nickles) when one of Eric's bets of nine
hit a win and we suddenly had $10.50 (210 nickles).  Barb called a halt and
cashed in!  We then went and had breakfast.  Barb had a short order of
pancakes
and Eric had hash beef, eggs, and an English muffin.  When we were finished,
Eric had to drag Barb out of the casino with her head turned to the wall
because
she couldn't resist the call of the blinking one arm bandits. 


We drove on to Drain, Ore to visit Susan Dolvin at her Westfalia Acres where
some of the WetWesties were camping for the weekend.  Met Brian with his
beige
colored vanogone and Larry Chase with his ultra techno decked out vanogone. 
Susan has been having problems with a battery in her Dormobile/Westie
draining
down.  Eric found corroded battery terminals, positive cable grommet out of
its hole and a strange Dormobile/Westie wire loose near the regulator.  On
top
of that, the battery charger she was using had a loose crimp where the wire
connected to the ground clamp.  Also she was having trouble getting the
ignition
wiring straightened out in her 74 Thing after an aborted auto theft.  Eric
thinks he figured out the wiring for that area, but the battery in the Thing
seemed to need charging.  We left after 2 hours and drove on through to the
Rest
Stop just to the South of Portland where Eric took over driving.  We refueled

in the Arco on the exit to Ridgefield, Wash, took on 13.178 gallons for
$18.44
and got 24.36 MPG at odometer reading 88669.  From there to our home just
South of Olympia,  where we arrived about 1530 (3:30PM).

Total gallons used 55.67, for an average MPG of 23.62, over 1,315 miles of
the 1425 mile trip, and total price of $85.23.  Our engine ran no hotter than

200F the entire trip while scooting along at 60 MPH.

So, now what to do with this short IRS stub axle.  Is it for a Thing!!???

Thanks again to all who made calls, looked for parts at Sacro., got us in
touch with "those in the know", etc.  Makes breaking down so much easier when

there are lots of nice folks to help you out!  The little black teddy bear
would
especially like to thank Wendy and Barb for packing lots of paper towels,
rags, and "wet ones" so he wasn't sacrificed as a cleaning rag "for the
cause"!

Take care to all,

Eric and Barb
