Subject: Re: [VB] Reely Stoopid Oil Question

Over the years, I've developed a single-handed technique I call 'go slowly
and concentrate on what you're doing'. Ever since I put this technique in
place, I no longer drip or spill oil all over the place. Plus, it gives me
a minute or so to think about stuff. Or gaze at the engine room ("Hmmm...
voltage regulator needs to be cleaned and waxed again").
