I was wondering what ways people have kept the important information
for your split in good shape & out of the weather since there is no
glove box? I have considered some small tupperware type thingie or
even plastic sandwich baggies (that would make a funny zip-lock
commercial). I'm talking about articles like the registration &
insurance papers as well as my maintenance book I keep.
