Subject: Oil in Gas

Ok, since oil is a hot topic, I might as well....

I've got some "older" gas in portable tanks from my boat.  In the boat engine
manual, it states that it is "ok" to use this gas, with a 50:1 ratio of gas to
2-cycle oil mixed in, in "most" automotive engines.

I was thinking of using it slowly...a gallon or two per almost full tank...in
my buses.

Or should I just dump it into the tank(s) of my GMC pickup?
