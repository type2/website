I think that the angle of the oil tower and oil separater (the "filler")
make it easy to spill.  I just go slow and careful and don't spill much.
If you want to get fancy, get one of those long thin oil funnels and cut
it down to fit the filler and engine bay.  You don't spill, but you get
the disadvantage of something else to keep clean.
