Subject: Re: [VB] Copper in oil

Ok...I guess then I'm looking for the distinction between the fine particles
that would cause a "sheen" and what would be defined as a flake (we're not
talking chunks yet)

Better yet....does anyone have a lead on a lab (as mentioned in the
type2.com Library) that would test oil?  I'm curious not only for this
engine, but for others now and in the future...
