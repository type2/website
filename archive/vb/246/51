That's a lot of territory between Jellystone & Jerome! not to mention
Oregon!  Most of it quite beautiful depending on your point of reference.

Sounds like a great trip-how long are you planning on being on the road?

Tom Buese-closest big show/campout 650+- miles away-did 1450 miles last
weekend to Sacto-didn't get close to the gas mileage that Eric & Barb did.
