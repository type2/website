I'd be more concerned about the gas having gone stale, than the oil in
it.  Have you tried any of the old mixed gas in the boat engine?

When my Dad first started driving his '74 Bug, I drained out about five
gallons of gas that had sat in it for a few years.  The next time my
'89 Ch(-at-)vy was empty, I dumped a gallon of the old gas in the tank and
filled up the rest with fresh 93 octane.  The car bucked and stalled
and didn't want to run right.  A couple of bottles of octane booster
and Heet helped a little, but it took me a couple of tanks of fresh
gas to get rid of all the old stuff.

The oil is probably not a big deal.  Using a gallon per full Bus tank
would drop the ratio to about 500:1.  Using a half-gallon would drop
it to about 1000:1.  You might change the fuel filter on the Bus after
you run the last of the mixed gas through, but it probably won't matter.
