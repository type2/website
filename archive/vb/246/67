Subject: FW: 21 window shirt/pretty much no VW content

I know that PJ O'Rourke is not to everyone's taste, but I did find the
below article entitled "A Cool and Logical Analysis of the Bicycle
Menace ~
an Examination of the Actions Necessary to License, Regulate, or Abolish
Entirely This Dreadful Peril on our Roads" very funny indeed.

Obligatory bus content: I removed an old faulty flasher unit (the old
relay type) with two pins from my '67 DC and tried (without success) to
replace it with a three pin modern unit (the VW place I bought it from
seemed to think it was the right part ~ a small grey box). I have tried
pretty much all the combinations that 2 wires on 3 pins can fit and
still no indicators. Aside from the obvious, ie. I was sold a bit that I
didn't need ~ can anyone suggest the real part # for a replacement
indicator unit relay.

Thanks
James
