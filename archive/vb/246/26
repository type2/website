Subject: RE: [VB] Copper in oil

Gene, 

I do know of someone that can help you analyze your oil. His name is
Larry Turner and here is his URL:

http://www.youroil.net/

I know of Larry from my Porsche Club of America associations and while I
have never used his service myself, I have heard quite a few people rave
about the service and how well it helped them diagnose issues with their
engines. Hopefully that type of service can help you as well.

Please do let us know what you determine if you use an oil analysis
service or find another solution. My only experience with flakes in
automotive fluid has been from transmissions in race cars which is
obviously caused by heavy use/abuse issues which is more than likely not
related to your request.

Best wishes,
Gary

Ok...I guess then I'm looking for the distinction between the fine
particles that would cause a "sheen" and what would be defined as a
flake (we're not talking chunks yet)

Better yet....does anyone have a lead on a lab (as mentioned in the
type2.com Library) that would test oil?  I'm curious not only for this
engine, but for others now and in the future...

Gene
