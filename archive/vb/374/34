Hmmm, mine has a metal nose, but the sleeve I was referring to went into
the other end (lower left in your photo)  I've never seen a picture of a
bowden tube with such a sleeve attached.

Now I didn't think of that.  I don't recall any such sleeve in the long
metal tube under the bus.  OTOH, I didn't look all that closely.

Considering how straight the shot is through the tube, I don't see how
there would be much friction there.  Most of the rubbing would be in the
flexible bowden tube.

I should have shot some photos, but I really didn't want to give my
digicam a grease job...
