schones Wiehnachten, Happy Boxing Day, Merry Christmas, feliz navidad, Happy
Hanukkah, Happy Kwanzaa and a happy new year to everyone!

Karen the lurker with a 1969 bay, but can't understand the talk on that bay
window list very often due to my unfamiliarity with the "pancake," lives in
Boulder, CO and is in Ft. Worth, TX for the holidays, and private nurse duty. 
Since it is Friday, may I also ask for oyur prayers to any deity for my
brother, who I'm here taking care of.  He is very ill, and the one who taught
me how to work on VWs and bought me my first, a 67 fastback, from a junkyard
for a dollar and had it running in three hours! Thanks and peace.
