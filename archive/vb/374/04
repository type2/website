Subject: Growing a thicker skin

Greetings,
I had delisted after a response to a "Dizzy overhaul?" question hit a bit of a
raw nerve with me.  Since then I have received a number of very positive and
supportive pmails from members of this list, in defence of both the writer and
the list itself.  I am heartened by such comradeship and it definitely
reaffirms the strength and integrity of the VW community.  As for myself, I
REALLY apologize for any misgiving that I may have caused to ANYONE on the
list.  For myself, I'll learn to 1: be a bit more clear in my posted
questions, and 2: grow a thicker skin :)
I'll just lurk for a while and absorb the info, while I love my VWs and strive
to have a safe and efficient vehicle, I think it is the people who make this
hobby and type of vehicle so unique.

Happy holidays everyone,

Drew
