If it is a brand new engine, and not a rebuild, I would look at the 
distributor drive. Pull the dizzy cap and see if the dizzy will turn. It 
should not except for the advance spring stuff. I have seen 2 engines where 
the brass gear on the crank wore off completely in a low number of miles. 
Boiled down to a case problem.
