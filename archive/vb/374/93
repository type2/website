Volkswagen said that the top speed of a Bus with a 42
or 44 hp (DIN) 1500 SP engine - what your Bus would
have originally had - was 65 mph.  At this speed, the
engine would have turning 4040 rpm.  Reference: page
139 of the 1969 "Without Guesswork" at
http://www.failsure.net/oacdp/wog69.html .  That page
gives the same top speed for a 1600 Bus, but that is
not directly comparable, because that is for a bay-window
Bus with a different (heavier) body and different gearing.
Page 5 of that same manual shows that your Bus probably
had the 42 hp (DIN) engine, which was rated for a top
speed of 4000 rpm.  Two of the three 1600 Bus engines
were also rated at 4000 rpm; one smog option lowered this
to 3800 rpm.  So, just going by the VW specs, a 1600 won't
get you any more top speed.  Compared to a 1500, it will
give you a little bit better acceleration.

Also, many people on the list feel that 4000 rpm is a
crazy speed for a Bus engine, at least from an engine
longevity and fuel mileage point of view.  Many people
like to keep it down to 3600 rpm and some don't like to
go over 3000 rpm.

Get the Bentley manual for your Bus.  This is a reprint
of the factory workshop manual.  The one for your Bus
is the '63-'67 one at
http://www.bentleypublishers.com/product.htm?code=V267 .
Don't be scared off by the list price; most vendors
(including your FLVWPS*) discount this quite a bit.

Since that manual doesn't directly cover the 1600, you
might also be interested in the '68-'79 Bus manual, which
does cover the Bus 1600:
http://www.bentleypublishers.com/product.htm?code=V279 .
Again, you can usually get it for a little less than the
list price on that page.

Another source with lots of photos is Tom Wilson's book
"How to Rebuild your Volkswagen Air-Cooled Engine".  ISBN
0895862255; your local bookstore or FLVWPS should have it
or be able to get it.
