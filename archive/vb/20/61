Its your bus do what you want EXCEPT LOWER IT. (Smile, Im joking. Do what 
your heart desires) And thats where ya know they arent hippies. How could 
they complain?
It annoys me to no end that people who profess themselves to be hippies are 
TELLING OTHERS WHAT TO DO!

Would they have liked it if VW said "NO STICKERS OR IT VOIDS YOUR 
WARRANTEE"? Of course not.
