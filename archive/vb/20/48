Sam,
   Great pictures, as always. I like to put surface mount tweeters up above 
the vent windows for directional sound. Radio shaft has 'em for about 20 a 
pair.
On the slats installation... didn't someone report that their slats were 
pop riveted from below into blind holes? Drill halfway from the bottom and 
the pop rivets head would swell into the wood and the pulling action would 
tighten them to the bed. No holes above.
