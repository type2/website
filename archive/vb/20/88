Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome Raffle Bus????? & OT - Bug for sale

I just got home from Kyle/Dede's house where we just finished the bus and 
took several pictures.  Kyle says he'll post them tonight.  I must say, that 
regardless of what some childish prank of an ad might say, this bus will most 
definitely sell a record amount of $0.50 raffle tickets.  I have got to raise 
a beer to those who helped work on this bus.  I can't remember everyone's 
names, but a detailed list has been kept and credit will be given where 
credit is due.  However, no one deserves more thanks than Kyle and Dede!  I 
could not even begin to put a price on their hospitality, generosity, and 
over-all spirit in this (and past) raffle bus experiences.  Here's to you 
guys.  I would like to ask all listies who can make it to Jerome, to stop by 
the Westfailure campsite and offer up a beer and thanks to these two 
extraordinary individuals.  Oh yeah, we can't forget their son, Alex, who was 
a big help in every way he could be.

See you in Jerome,
