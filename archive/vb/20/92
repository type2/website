When you say 'original' is there a 'modern' rubber replacement
seal available?  I bought new seals for my 23 project here in Oz but they
were 
'original' metal/felt (211 405 641A).  I would actually be much happier with
a
'modern' press in rubber seal if they are available....are they? 
And, if so, would anyone have a part no. for them?

Thanks
