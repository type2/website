Subject: PEZ/Johnney Lightning buses

   I just recieved a shippment of sets of PEZ JL buses. I am selling what I
have left for 30 dollars a set. If you want to get them cheaper in damaged
packageing go to www.dansdiecast.com  go to johnney lightning then limited
editions and you will find them there also.
