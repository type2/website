Subject: Re: [VB] importing goods to USA

I sold a '66 Westy Dormobile to a fellow from Cincinnati Ohio back in the
early 90s. Anyway, he took it across a low traffic border crossing, told the
US customs official what he had and what he paid, plus the relevant duty.
The US customs guy couldn't find the regulation highlighting the duty and
ended up charging him $50 to basically get him out of away. I seem to recall
he should have been charged 4+ times that amount, but can't remember
exactly.
