I really hate to get into this one but I used to export Fire Trucks to
Mexico and lands South.
All it takes to get a passenger vehicle across the border is a title and
one simple form that you can fill out at the border customs office or you
can file in advance. 
New vehicles are another ball game all together.... Yada, Yada EPA etc.
etc., but if it has that little EPA placard on the door post it is still
simple as long as it is a standard model it'll go.
As for the Canadian side they have their own rules and you should check
with them.
http://www.customs.ustreas.gov  US Customs website, you can search the
Harmonized Tariff Schedule or the Part 19 Federal Rules at this site.
And guys.... If you want to see how difficult it is to be a customs
broker go to my site at  http://customsbroker.netfirms.com/  and take a
few of the Customs Brokers Test that I have up there.
Just think of it this way. You're not doing anything illegal so you can
just drive across and file the entry form later.
Now that is a fact.
