Subject: windshield, ventwing glass prices?

Howdy list,
   I am needing both front windshields and the passenger side vent wing 
window for my '67 kombi.  I have a friend who has all the pieces but doesn't 
know what to ask.  Of course, I want to get them as cheap as possible but I 
don't want to rip him off.  I searched several of the bus parts websites and 
didn't see any glass so I was wondering approximately, what these might be 
worth.  They are the original VW glass in pretty good condition but one 
windshield has a few small bubbles along the edge.  Any input or opinions 
would be appreciated.
   I removed the 6 side windows and rear windows without any problems, but 
when I got to the wind shields, I used the same technique, and immediately 
cracked the heck out of both of them.  They were very thin un-VW glass.  Oh 
well.  I know there is lots of information on installing them so I'll search 
the archives for that.

thanks,
Wayne
