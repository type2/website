1.all vw's must be parked next to other vw's so they can "chat"
2.all beater busses must be reasured nightly that they ARE loved and WILL be 
restored
3.when a non vw person asks you (a self respecting vw person) how you like 
their new honda, you must reply "the engines in the wrong place"
4.hug your bus, love your bus, be ONE with the bus.
