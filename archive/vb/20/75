Howdy,
 Just bought a beautiful '64 camper from a long time lister who turned me
onto your little place in space here.

am looking for the best source (read cheapest/ best quality) for shop
manuals for my new baby.
looking for the Bentley as well as an early (pre 71) copy of John Muir's
Idiot's guide.
TIA and

love in the light
