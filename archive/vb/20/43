Subject: Re: [VB] windshield, ventwing glass prices?

FWIW, the vw splitty glass with the sekurit logo is tempered and hard to 
break.  theses were used everywhere but windsheilds in 67  us buses.   So if 
you were prying rthe lip of the rubber out to push the seal out withhe glass 
that works for the tempered/sekurit glass, but not the laminated windsheilds 
glass.  laminated glass you decided whether you want to save the glass or the 
seal, usually you just cut the old crusty seal.  

the wing window glass would not be worth much sekurit,   windsheilds that are 
not chipped or cracked or deep scratched, especially if they or sigla or 
delog  are worth more.   getting a windsheild cut can be $25 to $65 per piece 
depending on the glass shop, and original glass fits better than repro.  Used 
repro glass I think is worth less than real VW.  $80 a pair used?  $40?   
throw the wing glass in with it?    Of course, if someone were not my buddy, 
I would not let them have my spare original windsheilds, as they do 
occasionally need replacement.  You could call glass shops and find their 
prices on cutting windsheilds.  unless you really want the original logo, do 
realise new glass does not have thousands of scratches that create a haze 
especially at night.
