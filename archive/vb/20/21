  Man I thought Sacramento was supposed to be cooler 
than the furnace that is Fresno, what happend to 
the "Delta Breeze?" Lisa and I got to the show around 
2:00pm last Sunday and it was hotter than a snake's a$$ 
in a wagon rut! Shade was scarce but I finally got to 
meet Thom and mooched some of his shade- he had the axle 
and wheels of his trailer score loaded and he showed me 
his single cab bows. We also met John Yust (right?) and 
his 21 window, nice!
  What was left was an okay show, we settled in and 
watched some bugs, notches, ghias, and even a bus run 
the 1/4 mile. Saw times as low as 9.5xx. 
  We only caught the buss's last run (13 window deluxe). 
He had a good launch, some wheel hop in first (I get 
that too, those RGBs make first nearly useless when your 
trying to really get on it). He then broke his shifter 
going into second and ended up blocking the track about 
an 1/8 mile down until he got a tow :( ...You can't make 
a thoroughbred out of a pig - just a fast pig.
  We headed out south on 99 in air conditioned comfort, 
I had the cruise control on 80 and the Valentine One on 
(http://www.valentine1.com/ I swear by it). We're in the 
1.8L turbo new beetle and get passed by a pre '62 15 
window deluxe! He must have been doing at least 85mph! I 
couldn't get passed by some old bus, so I sped up! (not 
really, I'm kidding - but I did catch up to get a closer 
look). 
  I didn't buy anything other than the $15 admission X2, 
but had a good time anyway. It's always nice meeting 
other listees and seeing VWs. Happy Friday!
