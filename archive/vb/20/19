Subject: 1960 HT Deluxe WTF

    Well I got the front done on the 60 now am working on the rear.
    I went to put my seats in (middle and back) and the middle seat doesn't
fit, WTF I say to myself, it's a 60/61 middle seat but the clamp downs on
the floor and the cut outs in the mat are for a 2/3 middle seat, anybody got
a 2/3 middle seat they want to trade for a 60/61 middle seat. The weird
part is it's not a walkthrough.
    The M-Codes for the bus are 130 (deluxe, without sunroof and skylights)
and 378 can't find that one. I wonder if it means 2/3 middle seat hardtop
deluxe or maybe delete full middle for 2/3, really got me hanging.
    So I'm draining the gas tank, charging the battery (still 6 volt) and am
going to try to start it.
    The bus looks like it had new brakes all around that I am changing, the
bummer is someone stripped the passenger side axle, so out to my junk pile
and got another stub axle to change out but am going to wait to see if the
trans is any good before going through all the trouble to change the stub
axle. If the trans is no good I bought a used trans from VW Howard (complete
d-d big nut) I'll throw in till I get a new center section for the small
nut.
    Anyway that's my excitement for today, will work till 10pm tonight (long
day) on the 60, got have it ready for Jerome.
