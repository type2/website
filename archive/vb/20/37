I put a big nut (46mm-) RGBox tranny in my 61 when I got the bus- the PO said 
the little nut tranny that was in the bus was a howler.  It also already had 
a later front end on it.  Putting the later RGBoxes in it  means it has the 
later (1 ton) brakes.  ANd will reduce your engine rpms at the same speed (or 
allow more speed at same rpms.  I would use the big nut and 15" rims, unless 
you want it really low geared.    my 61 has a 4.37 r/p, .82 (bus) 4th, and 
the big nut 1.26 RGears, with 15" rims and a 1600SP it cruises up hills and 
happy on freeway at 60 all day.
