Damn man, you nailed it.  It amazes my buddies how I can travel so much and
have so many free places to sleep/camp.  "Dude, it's a bus thing.  You
wouldn't understand"

Similarities?

Busism - Nagging belief that non VW people are somehow deficient, but can be
redeemed when they become bus drivers.

Bus-dar - Able to sense the presence of a Type2.

Busography - When Albequerque is mentioned, you think of JP,  Nebraska = NQ
& Lafoon, San Francisco = UF, etc.

Buscentricity - A non-bus must be thought of in bus terms... Minivans are
Bus ripoffs, Bugs are just small Buses, houses are big buses without wheels,
computers were invented to help bus owners,  etc.
