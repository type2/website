On Friday, I was finally able to extract the sheet metal from the donor
bus to repair my westy. I cut out the back passenger corner. many thanks
to list members that bave me advise. I still have to pull the engine and
get the tank out, but all is proceeding well. I will also be removing
the fromt doors, assuming they are salvageable and the nose skin (which
is in good shape).

What a job it was. I spayed myself with the strongest insect repellant
made and still was bit a few times. And of course, we are in the midst
of a West Nile scare here.
