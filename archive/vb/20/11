Subject: crankshaft Endplay

  I finally got the motor out of my bus and have found my knocking to be 
caused by a loose flywheel.My question is what is the normal amount of play 
on a good motor?I havent messed with an aircooler before but I think I have 
more slop than three shims can fix,I dont have the motor handy to get a 
mesurement but would appreciate a good baseline to go by.
