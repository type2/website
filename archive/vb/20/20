Now we're talking.

-A job is just a way to acquire cash to spend on the bus.
-A house is just a place to safely store the bus when we are too 
tired to continue driving.
-The Wife/Husband, ect. is someone to keep you company while 
driving/enjoying the bus.
-Kids are things which aid in justifying owning many buses ("Its for 
the kids when they are old enough. Ya sure).
