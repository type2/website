treu, you should do whatever you want to your bus......
but a lot of what makes the bus so magical is its histery....the bus's 
memories of laughing, happy, traveling people, hippies or otherwise. to strip 
a bus of its history- its bare essense- is to undermine why we love them in 
the first place.
