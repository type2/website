Subject: IT DRIVES

   Today I took my 60 15 window for a spin, all said and done all I can say
is YEEEPEEEE, it will be at Jerome. The only thing I can't figure out is WHY
do people drive 40hp. This thing is a dog, no wonder VW went to 1500 in
later buses. If I have time (ya right) I do have a 1600 ready to go
together, but that's after I finish the 1904 I'm building, fixing my 1800
for the DD so VW Howard can use the 1776 in his ZEBRA SAFARI bus.
   Trans shifts beautiful and is smooth as silk, now to change the stripped
out stub axle and service it, but I wanted to make sure it worked first. New
brakes so it stops on a dime, even all the electrical works. The 40 hp I put
in is a 12 volt so I'm going to switch the bulbs, but when I get ready it is
going back to 6 volt so I can watch the clock tic away.
   It's been a good weekend nd the long nights here paid off.
