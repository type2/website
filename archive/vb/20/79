Subject: Cargo Doors

Hey again,

I also have some difficulty with my cargo door Lock/Latch.  The key locks
the barrel, but when turning the door handle, the "Outer Sleeve" turns.
This sort of negates the locked barrel, and opens the door.  I am wondering
if maybe the door mechanism is the wrong type/year for my panel.  It looks
like there should be "Stop for that "outer sleeve" to wedge against, to
prevent it from turning.
I have taken a look in my Bentley manual, but I don't see this outlined
anywhere.
