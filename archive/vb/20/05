Subject: steering column gasket... I NEED, I'll PAY

So, ok, looks like I need one for my 59 double cab... I was almost ready to
put the steering box in this weekend but maybe I can luck out and someone
has one of these in reasonable shape that I can use.... or NOS... hahaha.

I'm willing to give $25 for a nice one.


Any one willing>?
