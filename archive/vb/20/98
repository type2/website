 Hi everyone,.. I installed the 36hp this morning, and have a few questions,
 -Would it be "correct" for all my engine electrical hook ups to be screw
 terminal? including the voltage regulator?
.............
yes- in 1960 I believe they got push on terminals,  all the 36hp buses were 
screw terminals.  

 -The accelerator cable doesn't seem to return, I think I may have kinked the
 cable, is it possible to straighten it?

do you have that three piece return spring in between the carb  and the fan 
shroud on the accelerator cable?    has a spring, a cuptube, and a little 
holder clip thing that lets the spring press angainst the holdon to the carb 
part of the cable.    you can also add a spring under the front of the bus at 
the pedal area front of cable.  I had to mess with this stuff having a foot 
on my westy.  If you have a foot you need more springage
