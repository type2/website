Moe from the Transporter Garden in H.B. is looking for a few things but
is not on the list.  If you have anything he is looking for contact
him.  Just forwarding this as a favor.

=============================================================

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
I am looking for a pick-up rear corner section, right side with battery
tray for 55 to 58, In good used or NOS condition. I may accept 59 to 65
as a second choice.
I also need a rear hatch glass for a 58 to 60 Micro bus deluxe, Sekurit
not Sigla.
Or any good used belly pans for Double door panel or Deluxe, If they are

out there.
Thanks for your time, Moe.

Next OCTO meet will be October 21, at Transporter Garden in Huntington
Beach.
