I say good for you Thom. I have got more info from
your site than any of the "gods" sites. Do they even
have one? I have had a hard enough time getting parts
for a Westfalia before. I fade in and out in regard to
my participation in VW events because of some of the
crap that one has to deal with. I too would love a
barndoor but, like you, would find no comfort in
groveling for anything! Well, except maybe for that
trailer you are building....
