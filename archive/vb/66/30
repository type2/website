Well said Thom.

I think the barndoor parts fall in to the 356 Porsche category of analness
:)

At least for the Porsche crowd money talks and you can leave the BS at the
door...  Everyone knows "that guy" with a 23 window or oval in a barn and
will not let it go, so it rots away.

Hopefully I did not imply the Porsche people were bad in anyway.  They are
definitely good folks and amazingly helpful to their Porsche brethren like
the VW crowd.


Happy Journeys,
Adrian
