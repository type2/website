Gotta Chime in on this one.

Since a 72 Westy interior is a one year only wood grain pattern you should
save this one, put in a 74-up and have the blind spot eliminated, I think
allot less cutting also.

Purty sure the 73 is different in some way but not positive?

I'll trade you a 71 sink set up for your 72, thanx! ;-)
