Subject: 1960 DD panel F/S

  Here it is, an official X-hippy DD panel and it shows. The best thing of
this bus is that it IS rust free. What it would take to bring it back to OG
is some wheel wells to replace the ones cut out and some semi serious body
work on the passenger side behind the cargo doors. The nose is perfect
though and the bus is almost complete. No rear bumper and a later blade only
on the front. The engine blew and was abandoned somewhere along the freeways
of AZ. I baled it out of impound and then paid the owner also, sight unseen.
  To bad I don't smoke pot, being I found a tin of it in the bus. It is now
in the trash. I want to try to get my investment back out of this bus, so I
need to get somewhere close to 1000 dollars. It isn't that bad of a bus
really and you could just put an engine in it and drive it, it was driving
when it blew up.
