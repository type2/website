One of the things that soured me on the whole barndoor restoration bit was
the strain of trying to buy parts.  Not a *financial* strain, but the sheer
amount of social engineering and bulls*t that I had to go thru to get relatively
simple stuff from the parts whores.  That, and the 'community' seemed to look
down on me because I was doing the work myself instead of having CH or LC 
or one of the other gods do it.  Screw it.

I decided to spend more quality time - and money - with the 911.  Some parts
are more expensive, but I don't have to grovel for them before I overpay.  I
think the 911 folx as a community are as good or better than bus folk.  A guy
on Rennlist's wife has to have an expensive medical treatment, and they
raised $1500+ for her in about 12 hours.
