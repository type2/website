I have complete tie rods, the ends for the left side, Febi center pin kits
and a few NOS link pins.

Subject: [VB] Tie rods


Greetings to the list from long time lurker, first time writer.

I'm currently in the throes of restoration of a 67 SC, TUBAVAGEN,  which was
severely mistreated in its previous life as a plumber's truck in Opelika,
Alabama.  The engine is now purring and the brakes do an adequate job of
stopping.  

Now it's time to tame the steering!  Currently the truck seems to take my
steering input as merely a good suggestion as we wander down the highway.
I've been under the front end and taken the backlash out of the steering
box. (But not too tight - I've read the posts!)  While under there I noticed
side to side play in both front wheels.  (No up and down play - the bearings
were checked and adjusted when the brake wheel cylinders were replaced on
both sides).  All of the movement seems to be coming from looseness in the
outer tie rod ends on both sides.  Both inner tie rod ends appear tight - no
real play in any direction.  

Question:	Can I get away with just changing the ends, or should I buy
new tie rods for both sides since both ends are definitely OE parts with a
35-year history of banging down dirt roads?

TIA

Tim Cambron
67SC Tubavagen
