 Hi Chris,
 For our 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion we use a 165SR15 tire for a 
 spare to get us to the next availible tire repair shop.  Since we are using 
 205/75R15 on this bus the spare is a smaller diameter.  This means if we 
have 
 to use the spare on the rear this could ruin the differential if run for 
 several thousand miles due to the differant circumferances.
   You also could try just deflating the larger size tire to the point it 
 might squeeze into the rear spare postion and carry a tire pump (foot or 
 electric) to fill it when you need it.

I recommend carrying an electric pump.   I bought one for $25 at the local 
schmuck's FLAPS, and it is great.  It is made to use with the cigarette 
lighter, but I have an adaptor that means I can clip it to the battery 
directly.  I can fill up tires on the buses and bicycles and all kinds of 
time saving stuff.  It lives behind the front seat, easy access on road trips.
