Subject: RE: [VB] Tie rods

chances are the right tie rod has both ends fixed to the rod, so the only
solution to that side is to replace the entire rod. on the left side, you
can replace the ends, but you'll have to do an alignment of some sort
afterwords to get it right, unless you can manage to get the end to the
exact same length on the rod, but would be best to check afterwords
regardless.
other thing's i'd check would be: draglink, especially the end at the swing
lever, centerpin for wiggle and/or up/down movement (check with wheels on
ground and somebody turning you steering wheel back and forth).
