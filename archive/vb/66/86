Subject: 59 dc/sc gastank divider screws and strap pads

ok, ar question #2476453.... I put my gas tank in the dc last night and
started thinking about putting in the divider panels.  I counted 6 screws
needed for each panel and then went to look in the parts manual to see what
size/type fastener should be used.  The manual states a hex head screw but
in the work shop manual, it shows a guy removing the panels with a screw
driver and if you look real close, they appear to be a phillips head.  Also,
there appears to be a washer but it's unclear.  So I got to my sheet metal
screw bucket and I definitely do not find 12 matching screws. :-(

Also, from the pics in the workshop manual, there appear to be some form of
pad that goes between the tank strap and tank... info please!

So, can anyone tell me what is supposed to be there and then next, I guess
I'm looking for screws, possibly washers, and some original tank strap pads.
Top dollars paid or trades.... you know the drill.
