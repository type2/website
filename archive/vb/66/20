AHHHHH!

This brings back fond memories of May 1970 and standing up thru the sunroof
of a type 2 parked on my college campus and watching the National Guard
troops marching across campus w/ gas masks and other riot gear on to clear
the campus and restore "lawn" and order!!!

I wonder what happened to that bus????!!!!
