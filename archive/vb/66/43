Subject: spare tire size?

Honorable Bus Advisors, can someone please tell me what size spare tires
will fit in the spare holder hole behind the back seat on a 61 walk-thru
( w/ 15" spare ) and a 65 walk-thru ( w/ 14" spare ) The space is too
skinny for 205 / 75 tires.  I could get a bias-ply for a spare if that's
what it needs to be.  Thank-you, Chris
bus driver 
60/61 standard
61 kombi
65 21w
