  D Garies has been posting on the Vintage VW list for ages, I won't go into
that and has now found the Type2 and vintagebus list. There is NO reason for
him to post on Vintagebus being as far as I know he hasn't purchased a split
YET.

For the life of me I can't figure out what Hebs and 
Zwitters have to do with pre-'68 busses. As cool as they 
are, I just don't think the vintagebus list is the 
appropriate forum...even if it were a Friday.
