Yes. I have a 23-window bus, but it is a 1963. You fellows are a little too 
protective of
your list. I also own a 1971 bus. I'll keep posting to the Vintagebus list as 
I see need.
I didn't know that vintagebus was limited to owners of 1959 or earlier 
busses. Or would you fellows suggest another list? You fellows' posts come 
directly to me. I don't recall ordering it.
