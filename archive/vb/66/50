John,
     I to have noticed the change too, who'd would have thought a baywindow 
camper would sell for 4 grand.  When I first got into the world of cyber VW's 
back in the early 90's things were way different.  On Prodigy there was a 
group of maybe 20 of us, this was before IM's, free website hosting,and 
Prodigy gods would pull your post if you tried to sell anything.  Hence, most 
of us were there just because we loved VW's.  It was major cool, but time has 
this thing about moving forward.
     In this day and age, you have to be major careful about who you deal 
with/let the buyer beware.  I am very sorry you had a bad experience, but I 
am also very glad that it hasn't turned you off from VW's.  I myself pretty 
much stay away from E-bay anymore.  I do believe that they are one of the 
reasons prices have gone up, but one thing we must remember, the last 
imported air cooled VW was in 1979, that's 23 years ago.  A lot of us older 
folks have grown so use to having VW's around that we forget that, my self 
included.  
     I am amazed at the resources a vw owner now has on the Internet and how 
fast you can get information.  Hell, I never would knew the Idiot manual 
existed, till I bought a bus that had one.  The resources of the Internet 
allow most folks to skip the trail and error part of working on there VW, 
(Oh, some of the mistakes I've made in the past!! A auto stick super beetle 
comes to mind!)
     So I encourage anyone new or returning to the VW scene to lurk for a 
bit, you'll soon start to see the persons who are trust worthy.  I also 
believe in shopping around and if you do strike a deal with someone, save all 
the E-mails to cya (cover your a##).
                                                                           
Peace,
