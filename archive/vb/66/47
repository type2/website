Hi Chris,
For our 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion we use a 165SR15 tire for a 
spare to get us to the next availible tire repair shop.  Since we are using 
205/75R15 on this bus the spare is a smaller diameter.  This means if we have 
to use the spare on the rear this could ruin the differential if run for 
several thousand miles due to the differant circumferances.
  You also could try just deflating the larger size tire to the point it 
might squeeze into the rear spare postion and carry a tire pump (foot or 
electric) to fill it when you need it.
