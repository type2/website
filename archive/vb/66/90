Subject: RE: [VB] Tie rods: offer

I have a complete set: adj. tie rod, fixed tie rod, drag link, and dampner
if someone wants them... I think I got them from bfy.  I'd be willing to let
them go for what I paid for them ($34+$30+35+18=$117) and I'd ship free to
anywhere in the US.  Or, I'd trade for something of equal value (always
looking for og parts for a 59 dc and 67 sc)
