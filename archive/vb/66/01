 RE:  Media Opportunity - Can you Help?
 
 Good Afternoon-
 
 I realize this is short notice but I had a request and was hoping that you
 can help me.
 
 On Monday, January 21, The Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace will be
 welcome the Austrian Consulate General and a member of the Austrian Archives
 when they bring the Treaty of Westphalia to the Library for a new exhibit we
 are unveiling in February.
 
 What we would like to do is invite everyone in the Southland with a
 Westphalia Volkswagen to be on hand for a media opportunity that we are
 hoping to put together.  I'm contacting you hoping to gain some insight on
 who to contact and who probable it would be to pull this off.  I appreciate
 any assistance of information you can provide me with.
 
 Thank you,
 Arianna Barrios
 Director of Communications
