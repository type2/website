Subject: Front Axle Bearings

does anyone know of a roller bearing--number, size, whatever, for
retrofitting in the axle beam instead of the the bushings in a '59 bus
front end? i don't know if it would be an actual vw part, but maybe
somebody did some research some time in the past , or actually did it, and
could pass on the info.
thanks
