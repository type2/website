Subject: new bus won't start

Argh....my new 66 won't start, it tries to turn but the starter sounds 
really weak. I have a volt meter thing and test the battery the battery is 
putting out 6 Volts (bus is still 6V).

Put in third gear and pushed back thinking maybe the starter is stuck on the 
flywheel, but didn't do anything.

What could the culprit be?

THANKS IN ADVANCE!!!!
