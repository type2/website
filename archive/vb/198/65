Subject: got my first split, questions

You can see pics of Faded Bus here:

She's a 66 13 Window, og paint, still 6 Volt, engine is a factory rebuild.

I took her on the interstate and she would get fast enough to get in 4th 
gear, top speed was about 47 mph. What would cause this?? It doesn't have a 
airfilter, i'm going to get one today. Would that cause the lack of power?

The wipers were working but they stopped, any ideas on that?

Also, what are the reasons for upgrading it to 12 Volt?

Thanks in advance,
-Daniel
