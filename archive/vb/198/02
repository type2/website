Subject: RE: Crew cab

I do have some pictures on my old computer though I am pretty sure there
are some on the samba some where. I will forward them to you in a few
days when I pull them off. Oh and I apoligize but it was a bay window
(68) that I did it to and not a split. I forgot what list I was chimming
in on when I responded. I got the door, B and C pillers  from a crewcab
in Australia where the 3rd door is on the other side.
