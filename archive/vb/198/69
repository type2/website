Subject: Re: [VB]  A dumb question

I salvaged a mono Blaupunkt radio from a BMW 2002(model, not year) that was 
mounted with an oval speaker on a plastic dash panel. The radio fit the dash 
slot pretty good. I left the speaker in the plastic grill, trimmed and mounted 
it in the bus using a larger washer on the grab handle nut with the other side 
jammed into the dash flange. No rattles and it sounds great. 
If you want more volume a good way to go is to get wedge shaped portable 
speaker enclosures for $30-$40 and put 'em in the back somewhere. Bolt or 
strap 'em down if you're worried about theft. Good sound, no holes hacked in 
the bus and you can point 'em toward Ellis at the BBB campout.
