snip!


.  Does anyone actually know what is in the black hole void under the
> front seats in their bus

usually my experience is that there is horsehair stuffing fallen out of the
seat a smattering of mouse crap and the contents of something the DPO put
under there that has long since leaked out of its container eww :P

on the upside i once searched in one of those mysterious "black holes" on a
junkyard bus and was rewarded with a perfect "wolfsbrug" horn button
