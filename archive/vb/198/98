Subject: Thanks and Childs Cot Search

I want to thank everyone who resonded to my inquiry about upholsty shops in 
this frozen wasteland.  I envy those of you that get to attend BBB this 
month.  I bought my first snow shovel yesterday and put it to good use, 
although the rest of the neighborhood had snowblowers. I enjoyed shoveling 
the first half of the driveway...  It got old fast.

Today I begin my search for a hard to find accesory an early child's cot w/ 
poles.  Wish me luck.
