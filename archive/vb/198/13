Subject: It's up to ALL of Us--

 Have a VWonderful New Year,
   Reach out to someone, and give them some Cheer--
 It's up to All of us,
   To get on the Bus--
 And spread the The Word, that we really care,
   Giving to others, what we have to Share--
 Showing the way that Bus Volk Feel,
   Spreading the Love that we know is Real--
 It takes a little effort from all of Us,
   That's why we drive a Type II Bus--
 We keep this vehical going on the Highway,
   Let's share this love,with everyone--Every Day--
