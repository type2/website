I know that Ford and DCX use a Torks or other type of end on suspension
components to do just what you did.They also use NyLok fasteners on the
majority of the suspension components.

All of the steering components on my current VB and several past ACVW's were
replaced with the NyLok type fasteners with no loosening of the nuts.A
practice from the proto build days is the hit all fasteners with a paint
marker after torquing to signify compleation and to aid in detection of
backoff.

 Hi,

 So this may make some of you ill

 The Nyloc nut and drag link ball joint stud weren't going to move
 independently.....

 So, I got out the trusty Dremel and made a slot in the end of the stud
 for a large screw driver which let me keep the stud in place while I
 tightened down the nut. I was able to tighten it down to spec, so it
 should be fine....

 I sure wish they put a hex or torx slot on the bottom of the stud for
 situations like this, but that would be asking too much I guess.
