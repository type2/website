Shocks that have a stud mount (like later Beetle fronts) often have
wrench flats on the end of the stud for this.  I guess you could try
filing them on yourself but it seems like it would be easy to mess up
the threads trying.  The slot in the end is probably less likely to
mess up threads.

If you have enough stud, and two regular nuts of the same thread, and
can get the Nylok on a ways before everything starts spinning together,
you could thread on the two regular nuts, jam them together, and use
a wrench to hold one of them and the stud in position.
