One of the guys who swaps at Puyallup has a early bay jumpseat he hangs a 
$300 price tag on.  Says he just likes to sit on it at the swap, but people 
keep asking for a price on it.  He's wasn't planning on selling, but if 
someone wanted it THAT bad...

What's funny is I had picked up some round reflectors (think from a Ghia or 
type III) and I'd see people zoom over to them  as if they'd found the Holy 
Grail or something. especially as they had a cheap price tag on still, then 
the faces fell when they saw it was plastic.  eventually I took them off the 
swap table.  I hadn't meant to mess with their heads, it's just when I got 
back to the swap space I statrted to gab with people and forgot about the 
reflectors.   

When I drove my 61 15 window down to KP a few years ago (4 or 5) I was 
picking up a roofrack , so I had a roof rack on my roof rack.  I understood 
people asking if the 2nd rack was FS (Okay, I put a NFS sign on it) but then 
people wanted the safari window, interior panels, rear bumper, etc etc etc 
off my frickin bus.   oi!

I think display stuff is cool though.   I've been planning on making a board 
with things tied on it as a display thing to bring.  Just a conversation 
piece, you know.

 I find absolutely nothing wrong with that. (Guilty as charged)
 
 People set up their tents, tow their single wheels trailers, display their
 special camper accessories and those are 'not for sale; it's just for
 display!'
