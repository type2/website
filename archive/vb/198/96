Subject: BBB7 "Boat Tour"

 Hi all,
  At BBB7 we have the opportunity to go on a 'tour boat'.  The boat is the
"Dixie Bell" and it is a replica of a river boat.  The tour takes app. one
hour and passes under the London Bridge and out
around the island.  We will pass right close by the campsite on the way
back.
 The fee is $8 per person for our group, normal price is $13 per.  This boat
ride
is not part of the actual campout but just an added attraction.
 With the campout being only $25 for the whole weekend, you'll have some
extra cash.  We'll meet at the stage on Sat. at 2:00 PM and will not
conflict with and other
part of the campout event.
 See ya there!
  Lou in Havasu
PS. No the boat is not the "Minnow" and it's not a "three hour tour"!
