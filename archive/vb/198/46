Subject: Re: [VB] bus tool box?

I always clean mine out as soon as I buy a new bus. Truely a treasure hunt.
I've found lots of tools, early engine lid prop, crusty original key for the
bus, hardware for securing the spare tire in place, fan belts, change, nice
water bottle, a couple of wallets(empty:-( ), rags, big can of graphite
powder, road map of portland OR, mice(dead) and the usual mess that comes
with them.

In the 23 window I found receipts from a prior owner from years ago and was
able to track down the widow. She didn't remember much about it as her
husband took care of the cars but she did tell me they had owned two, mine
and one with logos from their buisiness drain econo wash. Couldn't believe
it as a friend of mine had just bought that bus still in original paint w/
logos a couple of years before I bought my bus!
