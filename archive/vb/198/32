That's different, those are part of what they drove.  I wouldn't ask someone
if their rear bumper or steering wheel was for sale either.

Uh, at your house where no one gets a five-finger discount?

Some of your other reasons were good ones but I think the parts should be
labeled "Not for Sale" or "Info needed," not placed with everything else
that is for sale.  I've seen people with their little glass case where half
the stuff in there is for sale and half isn't.

No offense toward Roger, just general statements.
