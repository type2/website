Hi John,
One got a speaker with the radio they bought for thier VW to mount in the 
speaker grill in the dash.  So the speakers tended to be from the same 
company as made the radio.  This was well before automotive stereo radios 
were widely availible thus the majority of radios came with only one speaker. 
 Radios from Blaupunkt were one of the few that had electrical hookup for 
both one or two speakers, the second speaker probably for the rear seating of 
the VW and definitely not stereo.
