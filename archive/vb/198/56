Subject: BBB VII - January 18-19, 2003! Lake Havasu City, Arizona. 

Hey all,
Just a reminder to plan on attending "Buses by the Bridge" event in Lake
Havasu, AZ during the weekend of January 18-19 2003. New location with
parking/camping on the grass instead of the usual Arizona dirt camping. (Hooray
for once!!)

I talked to Ronnie, the promoter this evening and he is in great spirits. He
reminded me that there is "only" two and one half weeks to go prior to the
event. There are raffle prizes galore this year. Knowing that I am an aircooled
turncoat and will be attending in my '97 Eurovan Camper, he said that there
will be a special award for the category of VWs 1980 to current model year. We
need to see a line up of exact, matching EVCs and Tiico engine converted Syncro
Westies etc. Drag out your megadollar MV, Westy, Winnie or mobile HAM shack! We
gotta show those aircooled hanger-oners how to *really* camp! =)

Saw mention of someone on the ev_update list from SE Arizona so there is no
excuses not to attend. Pregnant wimmen to "Octo"-genarians welcome. I'd love to
see a new crew of Eurovan and Vanagon folks. 

It's been a while since I have been able to make it to a distance event so the
family is looking forward to it. Pack an extra Madero for me and expect a good
time. Pomona will be dead! The action is in Havasu-baby!
