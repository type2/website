Please stop using logic! The real reason that people
ask that much is because they base the price on
emotional attachment and not reality! But it's
important to remember that while WE understand this,
it only takes ONE person to pay that amount and we are
ALL screwed as buyers.
 A friend of mine was in Sacramento last week and saw
a '57, either a Kombi or Micro, he wasn't sure. Just
for fun he asked the guy how much? The reply was,"how
much you got?" In his head he said $5.00! The bus was
on the ground, covering it's own bleeding motor
(freshly rebuilt, of course), factory safari's (no
glass), no seats/panels, Mid-seventies Super beetle
rims, tons of rust ect. After the guy said he dumped
$2500 on the front end my friend just stopped
listening as he knew the asking price was going to be
outrageous! 
By the way, if I came home with a 50K bus and was
fortunate enough to have survived the wrath of my
fiancee', I would buy a trailer too!
