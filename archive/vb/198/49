Nothing that can get me in trouble at the local border crossing.It is bad
enough crossing the Detroit/Windsor line but in an old VW bus you have an
instant three strikes just pulling up the checkpoint.

Usually it contains a MagLight,tow strap,small assortment of tools and an
old blanket to lay on as well as deaden the noises of the compartment
contents.

 I meant, I know there is crap in the compartment under there, but I never
use it.  Probably some neat  stuff.  Does anyone actually know what is in
the black hole void under the  front seats in their bus?
