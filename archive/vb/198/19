What you don't know is there's $40k in small denomination,
non-sequential, unmarked bills hidden under the back seat...

Is it me, or is the cap off the collective tube of modeling
glue?  There's pics of a 58 sunroof standard on my site, the
guy wants $50k  A used ribbed rear bumper on ebay, "Buy it Now"
for $1200.  A hacked-together Heb on ebay starting (-at-) $48k
