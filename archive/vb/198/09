Hi George,
True, but in the case of areas where tapered fit parts the nut could be 
completely gone, and then the taper fit part come completely apart!  We knew 
a fellow who removed his steering wheel mounting nut, but due to the stuck 
taper fit of the wheel on the steering wheel shaft it would not come off.  So 
he decided to put the nut back on a couple of threads and to drive it around 
till the taper fit popped loose.  Several weeks later while driving at 55 MPH 
on the highway it popped!  Apparently the nut (With the popping of the 
steering wheel.) spun the rest of the way off at the same time and this 
fellow suddenly had a steering wheel loose in his hands.  He fought with the 
steering while trying to properly engage the steering wheel at the same time. 
 Fortunitly he made it to the side of the roadway and stopped without any 
lasting damage!
  Mayhaps we are paranoid, but if the future only holds nylok nuts and we can 
not find castelated nuts to replace these and drill cotter pin holes in the 
new tie rods we will at the least drill the corner of the nyloc nuts and 
safety wire them.  Eric did this same drilling alot during his machinist 
duties in the USAF in aircraft (Mostly on C-130s the VW buses of the sky!) on 
all fasteners.  About the only fasteners not safety wired in USAF aircraft 
are the screws that hold on the sheetmetal skin.
