What i would do no matter what the seller did to "get it road worthy" would
be

First pony up the cash for a correct Bentley manual it will pay for itself
Buy a Bentley manual
Full tune up
New fuel lines
Make sure gas tank is clean and screen on outlet is clear and clean
Clean carb float bowl
Change all fluids(only GL-4 in trany and redux)
Clean connections on starter,battery chassis ground and bonding strap
between chassis and transmission,fuse block,light switch and ignition switch
Remove all Kustom and un-needed wiring,consult www.vintagebus.com for a
proper color wiring diagram for your bus.Will also help for the wiper issue
Check the whole brake system for issues.Has the friction material been
replaced recently?How about the flex lines?Repack front bearings while apart
While it is off it's tires lube and inspect the front end
Check motor for all proper tin and accessories

 She's a 66 13 Window, og paint, still 6 Volt, engine is a factory rebuild.

 I took her on the interstate and she would get fast enough to get in 4th
 gear, top speed was about 47 mph. What would cause this?? It doesn't have a
 airfilter, i'm going to get one today. Would that cause the lack of power?

 The wipers were working but they stopped, any ideas on that?

 Also, what are the reasons for upgrading it to 12 Volt?

 Thanks in advance,
 -Daniel
