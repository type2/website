Hi Steve,
We get the same info from those part numbers.  Also we have a set of those 
RGBs with lower stub axles, but no upper gears.  We got these BD RGBs just in 
case we ever stumble over a whole BD body without tranny.  So far we have 
only found most of the front and upper portions of cab from a BD SC truck.  
The fellow who had it wanted spare glass for his 1960s buses back in the 
1970s or 1980s, so had a wrecking yard out in his desert area cut across the 
nose just below the VW emblem and just above the bed!  Soon after he got it 
home the nice neighbor kids came over and broke out all the glass......
