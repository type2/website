 The reply was,"how
> much you got?" In his head he said $5.00!

For people like this.......... I will tell them $5 rather then keep it to
myself. If you want to sell something either be brave and list the price,
......or expect this response! And if the seller gets mad... so be it!! Time
to walk away....

My two cents from a lot of swap meet experience......
