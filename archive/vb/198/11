Subject: Re: [VB] question about nyloc nuts

"loose nut behind the wheel".........
fact or fiction ?! (You be the judge:)
And what was Barb doing while Eric
was drilling holes all day ?

I prefer antisieze on the castle nuts to
prevent rust-frozen removal.
Probably not good for nyloc nuts.
But you could always notch them
with a file, drill a small hole in the
tie rod end, and insert a cotter pin !
Or peen them with a centerpunch.
Now, does anybody have a ( dry )
torque spec for thr rear wheel nyloc ?!
