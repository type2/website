Subject: RE: [VB] bumper straightening?

Hi Jason,
I got my front and rear bumpers, (blades only)straightened at Bumper Boys in
Los Angeles.  They charged me $100 each, and the looked so good when I got
them back, that I didn't want to paint them.

They are listed in the phone book, and I think they also attend the Pomona
Auto Swap Meet every time.

Good luck,
Ed
