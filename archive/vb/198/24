Yeah, but I bet it had some cool skate stickers on it
though!I was actually suprised he didm't say anything!
We went to Solvang in '95 and while we were walking
around the swap he had me rolling! He was telling
sellers,"Dude, it's a piece of plastic (horn button).
What could possibly make you ask $800 for it? Does it
come with the rest of the car?!". 
My favorite ones are the guys who put out stuff and
then say it's not for sale; it's just for display! I
couldn't help but make a comment on that one.
