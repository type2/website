Especially when you consider that '67 is a one year only dash.  I think
the speaker bracket is too. I'm not too sure how many variations there
were, but I know that there were at least two.  The one I have in my '62
is the same idea yet different than one I picked up at the last OCTO. 
I'll take a picture and post.  Maybe someone can ID it.
