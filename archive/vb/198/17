Subject: Re: [VB] Screen Captures

I tried downloading and working with the program Harry 
recommended.  Nightmare for me...no idea why.  But I found a totally free 
and small program simply called ScreenGrab.  Very basic...but that's how we 
love it!

Got lots of Bus Selecta images to play with now!

Happy New Year!!
