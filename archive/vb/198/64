Subject: 67&earlier Kamper Kits

Hello everyone. Does anybody on this list have a camper bus that was made by 
Kamper Kits out of Campbell CA? I have a 67 model with almost all original 
installation still intact including the signature KK magazine holder in the 
rear where the walk thru spare would be (I have a 60/40 bench in mine) and 
the company applied sticker on my back window with their phone # (naturally 
no area code). I have a few questions so please respond to my email if you 
would and maybe we can exchange some info.  

Thanks

Ken Linoski, 67 KK camper
