Subject: Re: [VB] VW Bus Calendar(s)   I need your BEST VW BUS photos 

Also if you have any dates for your local VW shows please include them and I
will get them on the calendar.   Send your best VW pics (I have to use
submissions) and give me those VW show dates and any details that you have.
Also tell me where the show is!
