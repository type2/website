Hi Daniel,
From your description of the bus not starting your main suspect is the 
electrical system you need to go completely through.  Soldering the 
individual brass clips in the fuse box is a must and check the vintage bus 
library for the article we helped Matt Roberds write up for soldering all the 
riveted connections inside the headlight switch.  Most of all get a volt/ohm 
meter to check for voltage drops and the Bentley reprint of the VW bus shop 
manual.   Also check the starter bushing for wear and that the starter is 
bolted in tight.
  Install a wire grounding system from your taillights to the body bolt the 
negative battery attaches to is a must for bright crisp signals.
  Lastly completely go through your bus supension and brakes.  If it does not 
roll, stop, steer right your bus, you, any passengers and any innocent folks 
in your path are going to be in a whole lot of trouble.
