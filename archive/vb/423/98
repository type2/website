Subject: Re: engine lid key cover 

I have one of these, and I have tried to install it. I needed to remove the
latching mechanism, so I could see the hole from both sides. This key cover
has a gasket that comes with it. Make sure you install this.

 

The cover has two tabs sticking out the back of it, I guess you bend these
over the edge of the hole in the engine lid. 

 

I don't really know how to do this with regular tools. I tried it, and I
can't quite get it tight, the key cover just keeps spinning around.

 

I am looking for suggestions on ways to get this tight.
