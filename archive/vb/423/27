Subject: fresh air control gaskets

Well, I am still putting this whole bus back together.slowly but surely.

I had the door gaskets out, and was trying to install. I had the great
photos of how to cut/install them, but some seemed really long. Then I
searched the archives-I guess they always come long, and you need to cut to
size.

The fresh air flap has been done, and I think it came out really nice. Now
the control flap that directs it-It is supposed to have a gasket on it.
(This is the thing above the seats, that has a know to control the air going
to the back of the bus, or to the front seats) I heard from you all what to
get (http://www.bustoration.com/Air-Flap-Diverter-Seal-55-67-_p_1132.html) ,
and I got it. Now I'm not sure what to adhere it with, and how much trimming
is recommended. The stuff I got is the same stuff that is used to seal the
vent window. I imagine whatever I adhere it with has to be super strong, as
it is a tight fit.Do I just use some spray adhesive, like 3M super 77, or do
I use weather strip adhesive?

Suggestions appreciated.
