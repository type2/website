Subject: front door belt seal

When installing the seal that goes between the upper half of the door and
the lower half of the door, you have a seal with a lip but no holes in it. I
understand I need to cut holes in it for all the bolts/drainage etc. But at
the point where the door sort of has a bend in it, it appears as though I
need to cut clean through the seal, otherwise it can not turn. This is how
the PO did it when he replace this seal. I was not sure if this was the
"correct" way or original way.

 

Anyone know?
