Subject: dashboard fabric (-at-) speaker

I remember when I first had my bus it had the original fabric behind the
dash, that kind of hid the speaker, and so you couldn't really see through
the grill. It was disintegrating pretty badly. I pulled it out at some
point, with the idea of replacing it. I never found something like it. Does
anyone have any idea where to get this stuff. It is almost like burlap. I
don't know what held it in place originally either. Anyone else know?

 

I actually just came across the original scrap.
