Yeah, that is the piece at the front that controls if fresh air is coming
into the bus or not. I am talking about the flap that controls whether the
air goes to the driver and passenger or to the rear of the bus.

Seems to me that the rubber is supposed to be sandwiched between two pieces 
of metal which are riveted.
If it wasn't so hard to take apart, I'd get you a photo.
