Yes you have to cut a hole, and cut through the seal.   If you don't cut
through the seal it lips up and looks funny.
Leave enough of the side so it meets, so it still covers to inside edge of the
window frame post..

at the point where the door sort of has a bend in it, it appears as though I
eed to cut clean through the seal, otherwise it can not turn. This is how
he PO did it when he replace this seal. I was not sure if this was the
correct" way or original way.
Anyone know? See pic here:
