Subject: RE: [VB] windshield squirters

That is a different type than mine. Mine is a round chrome button cap
looking thing, with a small screw going in the side of it. You can turn this
screw to adjust direction of squirt, or you can turn the whole button cap
thing to change it as well. I'll try to get a pic and post it today.

As for water end of things...I got mine hooked up, and squirted water
through them for the first time in about 10 years...small leak at one of the
fittings, but I think I have the solution for that.

Here is what I have on my bus. Point the nozzles toward the windshields. 
Don't have the water end of things installed.
