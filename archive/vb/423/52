Hi Kevin,

My recollection is that you need to cut a V shaped piece out of the seal to 
make it sit flat.

When installing the seal that goes between the upper half of the door and
the lower half of the door, you have a seal with a lip but no holes in it. I
understand I need to cut holes in it for all the bolts/drainage etc. But at
the point where the door sort of has a bend in it, it appears as though I
need to cut clean through the seal, otherwise it can not turn. This is how
the PO did it when he replace this seal. I was not sure if this was the
"correct" way or original way.



Anyone know?
