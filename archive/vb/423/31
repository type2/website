Subject: [VB] dashboard fabric (-at-) speaker

----- Original Message ----- 
I remember when I first had my bus it had the original fabric behind the
 dash, that kind of hid the speaker, and so you couldn't really see through
 the grill. It was disintegrating pretty badly. I pulled it out at some
 point, with the idea of replacing it. I never found something like it. Does
 anyone have any idea where to get this stuff. It is almost like burlap. I
 don't know what held it in place originally either. Anyone else know?
  I actually just came across the original scrap.

=================================================

Four or five years ago I had the same issue when installing a stock sapphire 
radio
in my '63 bus. As pointed out the original materiel has a texture of burlap.
It happened a family friend raises chickens and while visiting I noted a 
feed bag had
the same texture. After asking I was given the bag which I washed several 
times to
soften it slightly. I then cut it to fit the dash opening, actually just 
slightly larger.
Then went to ACE hardware where I purchased some very light small mesh 
plastic
screen materiel and trimmed it to the same size as my dash sized burlap 
"patch".
Took duct tape, went around the edges to tape the two together and then 
stapled
the cover in a few places to reinforce it. Used some very small staples TOT 
50
or something like that. The two materiels taped together are very light yet 
flexable.
Inserting the radio/speaker cover behind the grill in the bus, it fit fine 
with some slight
trimming here and there, plus it looks OG. The edges with the tape are out 
of sight and with the
sapphire radio installed, it looked and fit great. As I said its been in 
there about four years now
with no issues.
You may want to consider this for your bus.
