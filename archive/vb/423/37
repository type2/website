Subject: Re: [VB] fresh air control gaskets

Hmm, that one is hard to get to also, but maybe I can view it thru the

Will look in the morning.

Yeah, that is the piece at the front that controls if fresh air is coming
into the bus or not. I am talking about the flap that controls whether the
air goes to the driver and passenger or to the rear of the bus.
