Those upper front door hinge pins are a problem, especially with the aftermarket mirror assemblies that have undersized pins. You could have the pins plated up to a larger size or as you said, drill out and sleeve the holes. Never done it,

Actually the hinge pins are quite tight, although the hinge pins for the
front door, or rather the sideview mirror post that acts as the front door
pin, is loose. I'm not sure what I could do with that...unless I drilled the
hole out, then put an insert in? Anyone ever do something with this?
