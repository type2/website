That's put in with rivets, not adhesive. Instructions here:

http://www.wolfgangint.com/Parts/Fresh+Air+Duct+Seal/

"This is the flat seal for the air duct on buses 1955-1967. To replace
it the flap assembly will need to be removed. The rivets are drilled
out with an 1/8" drill and the new seal is put in with 1/8"
poprivets."

They have a better picture that shows the rivet holes too.

 (This is the thing above the seats, that has a know to control the air going
 to the back of the bus, or to the front seats) I heard from you all what to
 get (http://www.bustoration.com/Air-Flap-Diverter-Seal-55-67-_p_1132.html) ,
 and I got it. Now I'm not sure what to adhere it with, and how much trimming
 is recommended.
