Subject: clutch ... what do i need? 

Looks like I'm in the market for a clutch kit . so, I'm hoping someone can
tell me what I need. I have a 1600 . with a  12 volt flywheel with 6 volt
gears (I think)  . I had it made by rimco to fit my 6 volt transmission and
1600 engine . so, what size clutch kit do I need?
