Those look very cool, Does anyone know of a US supplier of such things?

Hi all,

I replaced some of my warning lights with LED versions - just another 
option and give a nice strong colour although there is a polarity issue 
with some of them as I remember. They wired some of the connections in 
reverse on the speedo with the centre point of the bulb as negative.

I used this supplier for the BA7's
