Yeah I have the flaps out. The old gasket type material was all shriveled up
completely on one of the flaps-to the point that it was no longer attached,
and on the other one it has shrunk to the point that it is smaller than the
metal piece. It is still kind of hanging on. I Just don't want to use the
wrong glue for this, and have it fall off in couple months, after I have the
headliner installed!

If you are going to install a headliner in your bus, or new cab roof panels,
you might want to renew the directional seals ahead of time.  

There are two phillips screws on each side of the air vent that hold the
directional flaps in place.   

One on each side is above the headliner or panel board.  If that is in place
you will only see the lower screw.   You will also only be able to undo the
lower screw, which means you cannot remove the flap to renew the seal with
the headliner or ceiling panel in place.

I need to do this repair on my kombi.  ;)
