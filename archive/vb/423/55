Subject: new blog on restoration

Well a few of you asked about pics of my restoration process. I have never
done a blog, but this seemed like it could be a good way to go. I'll be
posting pics of stuff I have done. Hopefully some of you can use this if you
ever try to restore different parts of your buses..

 

Here is the location. I'll let you know as I add different stuff. Right now
I am focusing on the crank out windows, as I have spent a stupid amount of
time on them. And they don't even look that good, but hopefully they will
block road noise better, and keep the water out. 

 

Here is the page:

If anyone has any suggestions on ways to improve the layout of the blog, or
how to do a blog, or a different way to do it altogether let me know. I have
never done it before, nor read anyone elses blogs.and am not even sure if
this is the best way to make a site for this type of info.

 

I just thought it would be relatively painless, and I could add stuff as I
had time.
