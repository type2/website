What I do is to install everything as it will be installed.  Then I  
use a small ball bearing that is about 2X the diameter of the rivet  
shank and a "C" clamp to press rivet.  Grease the bottom of the hollow  
end of the rivet so that the sides of the hollow rivet will slide  
smoothly on the ball bearing as you carefully turn the "C" clamp.   
Viola!  A perfectly bucked factory rivet with no chance of whacking  
the glass.
