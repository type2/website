Well, I am still putting my bus back together-post painting & buffing. I'm
sure I will be for a while. 

 

I upgraded the lights to the H4 that were on sale a little bit ago from Bus
Dep(-at-)t. I read about the HID upgrade, which sounds great, but I've got to
leave some projects for the future.

 

The light kits came with this large rubber thing, that looks like it is
supposed to go on the back of the light. I assume this is not for our buses,
did  I assume incorrectly? I don't see exactly how this seal can go on the
back of the bulb/lamp housing and not melt. I'm also not sure how to mount
this so it stays in place.

 

Suggestions appreciated..
