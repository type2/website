Subject: adjusting cargo doors

Anyone have any tips on adjusting cargo doors?
I spent a bunch of time adjusting them until they looked right, and closed
correctly.without hitting each other.

Then I put the gaskets in, and no matter what I do, they hit in the middle.

I tried searching the archives...but no luck.
