Subject: RE: [VB] adjusting cargo doors

Actually the hinge pins are quite tight, although the hinge pins for the
front door, or rather the sideview mirror post that acts as the front door
pin, is loose. I'm not sure what I could do with that...unless I drilled the
hole out, then put an insert in? Anyone ever do something with this?

ditto, my doors look great without the seals in, maybe the hinge pins 
are worn and the seals force the doors to move ?
