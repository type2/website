Subject: odd oil 'leak'

while trying to tune the new motor, i was using a timing strobe... 
and when i pulled the tester lead off the plug wire, the side facing 
the tin was covered in oil spots.  a bit watery (hey, its portland), 
but oil nonetheless.

as far as i can see, only two places this could have come from: blown 
past the plug wire collar (shouldn't; brand new wires), or from some 
small hole in the head shroud, like a screw hole.

either of these should imply a cooler leak. except that the outside 
of the case is bone dry, above and below. well, except for the drippy 
flywheel seal, DESPITE the ac.net double seal i put in  :P

any other causes to look for?  it could be possible that a small 
puddle of oily condensate was sitting in the intake area, and was 
blown upwards when i started the engine i suppose, but i want to 
eliminate all prospects.

as far as the tuning went: i backed off the advance 5 degrees, 
double-checked valves and dwell, and adjusted carb. runs a bit 
cooler, but is back to being so gassy my wife could smell me come in 
the house, and the inside of the bus smells like a refinery.
