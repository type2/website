Subject: RE: [VB] wiper motor upgrade?

I just took the wiper motor apart again. I thought I would check to see if
anything needed sanding.as per eric & barb's suggestion. I looked at the
armatures, and noticed that the replacement is a bit longer than the
original one, so the top of it was hitting the bottom of the holder for the
brushes. I think there is supposed to be a small gap there. I also noticed
that the bottom and top of the armatures were slightly different. Now I
don't know if these differences are enough to cause a problem.

 

Anyway, I figured out if I put a couple washers under the holder for the
brushes, it lifts the holder up enough to leave a small gap at the top of
the armature. Now I just need to bring it back, hook it up, and test it. Do
you guys know a way to test these thing without having to hook it all back
up? Can I just hook a battery up to it? Could that damage it?

 

What I still don't understand is the terminal designation and the fact that
three wires feed my motor-but not on any diagram. Does anyone know what they
have for their bus?

 

Thanks for your help, I'll keep you posted as I make progress.
