Subject: windshield squirter bottle.

When I got my bus originally, over 10 years ago.the washer bottle didn't
work. It sat on the shelf taking up space. Then unfortunately I hit it with
my knee and the top shattered.

 

I bought a bottle and top off the samba.I think from Everett, but it has
been a long time. I also got a new button piece, I think this was from WW. I
never installed it, as I liked the room I had on my shelf.

 

Well now that I am finally bringing the shine back to my bus, I thought I
would hook the squirters up again. I took the one I had apart, and saw some
brass bolts that hole the top together. The rubber button the original one,
was all dry rotted. So I took it out, and tried to put the new on in, and it
is not the same, and doesn't seem to seal properly.

 

Has anyone else done this, or have tips on what to do with it to get it to
work. I know you can buy a whole new repro from WW, but I'd like to get an
original going, and I don't think I really want to spend the money on a new
one.I'd rather spend it on other things for my bus.

 

On a side note, I'm thinking of learning how to set up a blog, so I can post
pics of all the work I've gotten accomplished-thanks to this list. I'll let
y'all know if I get it going.
