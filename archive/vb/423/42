Subject: retrobright?

Has anyone ever heard of Retrobright? It is this concoction that these folks
came up with to restore old computer cases from their yellow state back to
their original off white state. It is something you can mix up yourself.

I thought about trying it on my visors and the grab handle which have
changed a bit from their original colors.

 

I tried using a whitening toothpaste, as suggested on the comments on that
page with no luck.maybe I'll try the mix suggested. I was hoping someone
else has tried it, so I know if it would work or not.
