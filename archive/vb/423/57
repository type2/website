Subject: RE: [VB] dashboard fabric (-at-) speaker & radio insert

Thanks...that sounds like a good idea sandwiching stuff together. It is kind
of funny, that my recollection of the fabric was that it was similar to
vintage speaker covers, like the beige/brown/gold stripe on this page:
http://www.vibroworld.com/parts/tech10.html

But when I actually took it out of my box of old parts box, and saw it. It
is a bit more like burlap.

I've actually also been thinking of what to put where the radio was. I have
the original radio, but have since converted my bus to 12V. The radio also
had to be rigged to turn on and off with an external switch. I was thinking
of making a small metal box the same size as a radio, but where I could
throw my cell phone while driving...with maybe a little charger cord coming
out the bottom of the box.

I'll let you all know if I ever get to the box idea.

After asking I was given the bag which I washed several 
times to soften it slightly. I then cut it to fit the dash opening, actually
just 
slightly larger. Then went to ACE hardware where I purchased some very light
small mesh 
plastic screen materiel and trimmed it to the same size as my dash sized
burlap 
"patch". Took duct tape, went around the edges to tape the two together and
then 
Stapled the cover in a few places to reinforce it.
