Chris, 

Find another vehicle with a pattern you like, put it in front of a wall or fence. Mark the position of the headlights on the ground, mark the high/low patterns with chalk. Move the bus into the same position and adjust! Appropriate technology.

p.s. No VW's in the driveway, but do have a BMW now. Will be at the Madera Spring Fling to sell more parts I've found in the garage.

Hi, 

I installed my new headlamps from The Bus Depot last weekend. Very easy 
installation. I like the pattern they create on the road. Just need to find a 
good place to do a proper alignment. 

On the discussions, was it Ratwell that had photos of the light pattern?
