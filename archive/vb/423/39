If you are going to install a headliner in your bus, or new cab roof panels,
you might want to renew the directional seals ahead of time.
There are two phillips screws on each side of the air vent that hold the
directional flaps in place.
One on each side is above the headliner or panel board.  If that is in place
you will only see the lower screw.   You will also only be able to undo the
lower screw, which means you cannot remove the flap to renew the seal with the
headliner or ceiling panel in place.

I need to do this repair on my kombi.  ;)
