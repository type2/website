Hi Kevin,
Personally would put the sprayers pointing inward.  Air hits the bus
nose at higher speed and splits, so the washer fluid tends to flow on
the glass outward.  Probably aim them so spray hits about at 1/3 on
glass from the center body post.

>>Thanks, does it work better to have this pointing towards the center
of the bus, or to the side?B I just want to get it right first, as I
know it is a paint to adjust after everything is back under the
dash(parcel tray, radio, etc.)B B B Was writ:Neither,it is supposed to go
sideways to the glass.B  Then you pivot the sprayer to spray the
glass.E&BB B -Kevin Jamaica Plain, MA'
