Ya, in 65 they had a chromed metal squirter nozzle, different than the 66/67
kind.

That is a different type than mine. Mine is a round chrome button cap looking
thing, with a small screw going in the side of it. You can turn this
screw to adjust direction of squirt, or you can turn the whole button cap
thing to change it as well.

Here is what I have on my bus. Point the nozzles toward the windshields.
Don't have the water end of things installed.
