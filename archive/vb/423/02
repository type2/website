Subject: Re: [T2] tires - wheel size tangent

With all this knowledge and brainpower working on the tire problem, anyone 
have some insight into 15" tires for the older buses? I'll soon need to 
purchase some new tires to replace my 9 year olds and there seems to be few 
choices for the old 15" rims.

Thanks,
Chris
