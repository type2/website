Subject: vent window rivet

So putting together the vent window.I've got the rivet in, as well as the
friction washer, but I'm not sure the best way to secure the rivet, as I do
not have the special VW tool for this.

 

What do you guys recommend for this? A pair of vice grips, hammer? I am a
bit nervous about swinging a hammer anywhere near this set up.
