Subject: windshield squirters

I am re-installing my windshield squirters, and I realized there is not
gasket between the squirter and the body. I picked up a basic round neoprene
0-ring to put in there. Round in cross-section, kind of like a donut.

 

Which direction should the little thing stickout out point? Towards the
front or towards the glass? I hooked it up, and pushed the squirter, and it
just seems to shoot straight up. I am sure I could figure it out after
installing the windshield and driving it, but it is a lot easier to adjust
in the garage with no glass.

 

TIA
