Subject: Re: [VB] Rear bumpers

Interesting note that the rear of a single cab is different from a regular 
bus. Didn't think about that one.
Anyone know if the bumpers are actually different?

"'59 single cab", "Wolfburg West repo rear bumper", "cannot seem
to get the side mounting holes (rear quarter to the ends of the bumper) 
lined up"

     I saw these statements, and read to see what everyone said.  Something 
that hasn't been addressed yet is the difference at the rear of a bus versus 
a truck in VW Land.  All Bay-Window and Split-Screen busses are rounded at 
the rear.  All Bay-Window and Split-Screen trucks (single or double-cab) are 
squared at the rear.  No one makes a squared-truck reproduction bumper.  If 
your reproduction bumper is not squared, none of the holes will line up, as 
its made for the rounder end of a bus.  I don't know about the vanagon or 
newer eras.  You can always tell if the bus bumper is on the truck because 
at the curve, the metal of the bumoer touches the bus.  On the truck bumper 
the clearence from body to bumper is the same all the way around.
