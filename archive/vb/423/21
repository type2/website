Is there a chart somewhere to cross reference, or to determine what type of
bulb is used in my bus? Ie - turn signal, front and rear, dash bulbs,
license light bulbs.

Make sure to ask what the polarity is on them.  We were able to reverse the
polarity in the ones we got, but takes about fifteen minutes each and on
occasion broke one.
