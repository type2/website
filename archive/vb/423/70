Subject: Re: [VB] Rear bumpers

There was a different/ truck bumper through mid 1960.
From mid 1960 on they used the same rear bumper as a bus.

There is truck bumper info on http://dropgates.com/

I have seen some fitment issues with a repro rear bumper on a friends '63
camper bus.  I don't remember exactly, but something was funky.   I wanted to
fit the splash pan and bolt it to the corner, so I could set up the westy
awning.  You need that bolted in place or it'll sag the bumper down, but for
some reason that was not possible.  I forget exactly why.

  Basically, I think the issue is the repro bumper is imperfect, and it has
nothing to do with it going on a truck.
Here is what some people said:

Interesting note that the rear of a single cab is different from a regular
bus. Didn't think about that one.
Anyone know if the bumpers are actually different?
