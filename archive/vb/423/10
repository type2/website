I have no plans on moving the original site. My plan is to copy all the
type2.com content over to the new type2.com/s site. This way, all original
links will remain usable. I put some type of link at the top of the
original pages, notifying readers of the new site. Later tonight, I will
put a link to the original type2.com site on the new type2.com/s site, and
re-point the old email archive search page to the new one. I'll put a link
in the left column of the old site, and the bottom of the new site, for
reporting bad links.

I'll report back later this evening.

Peace, Troy
