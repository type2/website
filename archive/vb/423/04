Hi Chris,
Have been running on our 1960 panel walk thru camper conversion.

Front: Trail Pathfinder A/P P205/75R15 weight rated 1598 Lbs.

Rear Cooper Discoverer Rail 195R15 weight rated 1764 Lbs., these are a
tad bit taller than the above, but not wider.  With the early (pre-late
1962 model year) lower thinner rear wheel wells these tires work well.

E&B
