Subject: wiper motor upgrade?

During all the recent work on my bus, I also figured it was time to swap out
the armature on the wiper motor-as I had changed the bus from 6V to 12V a
while(with all of your help). 

So as the painting is done, and I'm putting it back together, I am quite
stumped by the wiper motor.

I had labeled the wires, and think I hooked them up right, but the wipers
don't work. I know power is getting to the motor, as I can feel it warming
it, when I pull the switch. I checked the wiring diagrams, and this is where
I really get stumped.

According to the wiring diagram, my wiper should only have one wire going to
it, and it is grounded by a screw or it should have 4 wires going to it.

Mine has three.

The three wires are labeled 54d (black w/purple stripes), 31b (reddish
brown) and 54 (black).
The switch has the same labels, plus a 31(but this does not have a tab). 

I checked that wiring designation list I posted a few days ago, also found
on vintagebus.com and out library.
The wiper motor terminals should be designated with 53's not 54. 54 Is
supposed to be for "trailer signals'.

Anyway, short of putting the old 6V armature back in, any suggestions on
troubleshooting?

Oh yeah I just checked my records, I replaced the original wiper motor
complete assembly back in 2003. I didn't note what I put in. The motor is
labeled SWF, and so I thought I could change the armature on it. I know the
armature swap is not supposed to fit on '65, but it fit, so I figured it
would work.
