Since the knobs and push buttons of the radio go though the fabric, and it is
sandwiched between the speaker and dash, and the speaker screwed in from
underneath  it would be hard for the fabric to fall out of there.

I used to have a Sapphire installation brouchure that showed it, but no
longer.

This is exactly what I was talking about.thanks. Although it doesn't seem
ike anyone knows what holds the fabric in place, except friction?
