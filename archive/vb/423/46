Subject: Best SVDA dizzy.

So after perusing my dizzy stash I find nothing that I'm sure was from an
upright, so I'm looking at the now ubiquitous "SVDA" offered.  Does anyone
feel there is an actual difference in quality between the Bosch Mexico and the
Asian versions?  Should I pay as little as $110 without or $135 with an
electronic points replacement off of *bay or from CIP for an Asian, or spring
$160+ for a Bosch with points?  I'm not against points here BTW, just trying
to gage if there is really a quality difference in any of these, I don't tend
to feel Asian is worse than Mexico for most things, even if there is still a
Bosch name cast in it.  The *bay guy sells both, claims all are checked for
curve on a dizzy machine.  Any opinions folks?  If I go points Bosch unit,
I'll likely run an old "Universal" CDI I have hanging around, I don't have
anything against points, prefer them in fact with a CDI so that I can revert
to points if the CDI ever fails, this one is 15
 years and 4 buses old.
 
Opinions welcome, rebuilt the 34-PICT 3 last night, looking forward to plating
and running the truck.  Still deciding on which is worse new condition '03
date code crap tires (35psi and crappy unreinforced) that came on it, or those
beautiful but ancient reinforced Conti Contacts with more than 85% tread but
as I looked at em this weekend, '97 date codes sitting on my abandoned syncro
junk storage unit...
