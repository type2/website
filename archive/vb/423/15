Subject: speedometer lens filter

Hey guys,

 

I have bought these lens filter things twice, and they sit around until I
lose them, then turn up every year or so, and I keep meaning to replace
them.

 

Well I finally am sitting down to replace them. Speedometer out. Lens
filters MIA(but I'm sure I'll find them soon.) 



Apparently they were originally held in place with tape? How do you guys
install these, do you still use tape, or a bit of glue? And if glue, what
type?

 

Thanks.
