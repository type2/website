Subject: re:speedometer lens filter 

Thanks.I just was throwing more odds and ends to install on my bus, and I
found the speedo light filters. I think these are the ones I bought almost
ten years ago.plenty of red and green, but just a small piece of blue.

 

I had some crazy glue stuff, put a couple dabs on the speedo, and dropped
the filters in place. I then pushed on them a bit with a screwdriver, just
to press the edges down. Thanks for the info on what glue to use. It looks
like it worked! I'll try to re-install speedo tomorrow.

 

While I have the speedo out, should I be lubricating it anywhere?
