Subject: Re: [VB] rear bumpers

This is problematic on an older bus that has seen body work. The holes don't 
line up on my bus either.

Did you have an original bumper? Did the holes line up?

I have a '59 single cab with a Wolfburg West repo rear bumper.  I cannot 
seem
to get the side mounting holes (rear quarter to the ends of the bumper) 
lined
up.  They are way, way off.
