Subject: Re: [VB] Rear bumpers

The bodys on our old VWs have fairly flexible/bendable rears.  I  
suspect that over the years they have developed a bit of twist and  
bend to one side or the other?  Look at the gaps between engine tin  
and the sides of body from side to side and you'll probably see a  
difference.  My fairly straight and clean '66 has a slight bias to  
one side which I really notice when reinstalling the rear bumper.
