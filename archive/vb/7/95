Great deal, but one minor correction: that appears to be a Standard,
not a Kombi! (don't worry, that's a Good Thing)

I once got a '59 sliding rag bug for $75.

My best *parts* score ever was a set of NOS ribbed bumpers,
NOS '67 driver's door, NOS bumper trim (late), NOS barndoor
engine lid, several NOS 100mm gas caps, and some other stuff
which I can't remember right now - for $600, shipped.
