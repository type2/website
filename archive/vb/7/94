since we're going down and down on price, i'll chime in before jp tells us
of his $2 truck.
i unknowingly bought a 67 westy, complete, for $35. i was just standing
next to it when the auctioneer came past and said "ok, what's your number"
and it was mine. this was at the IRS auction for a resto place in waco,tx
called farm fresh a few years ago. after another person and i were in a
frenzy on trying to figure how to get 3 busses from texas to albuquerque,
we arranged it so shipping was practically nothing. i rebuilt the motor and
drove it for many years after.
