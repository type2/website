Call Rancho Trans  714  680 6737 ask them to sell you a 68/69 bus
bellhousing. Then get yourself a 12 volt to 6 volt bushing to be able to use
a 6 volt starter. You can then buy a cheap engine stand (Harbour Frieght)
and bolt the bellhousing to it. Easy cheap way to do it.

I have an order in for an engine starting kit with RMMW, and they have put
me 
off once again. I've been waiting for two months. What I need is somewhere
to 
buy a kit  to start my engines without installing them in a car. It's RMMW 
part no. VL16-001, two pages from the end of their catalog. I have some 
12-volt and some 6-volt engines that I need to use this part on, especially 
the three 6-volt engines sitting out front in my shop.

Any help? Anyone?
