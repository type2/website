Please don't do this again. The arc puts off a huge amount of UV light--you
can get major sunburn from arc welding with exposed skin. And let's not talk
about arc spatter--molten metal flying around all over the place. Heavy
denim jackets are good, leather jackets are good. Wear either one of those,
some good gauntlet-type gloves, atheist pants (not holy) and sturdy leather
shoes. And your helmet, of course.
