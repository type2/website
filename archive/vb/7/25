Subject: RE: [VB] AIRS Rescue

Is there some reason why I can't open type2.com?  I have been trying
periodically for about 6 months with no luck.  I also can't open any
geocities sites.  Very strange.  I can open all other pages with no
problems.  I thought type2 was down.  I even tried re-setting the
defaults for my web browser.  In addition to that I have tried Netscape
and Opera browsers and they don't work either.  What is it about just
type2.com and Geocities that I can't access them?  Is this Da Man trying
to keep me from VW info?

Well, there will always be a few deaders, but the victories make up for
it.  You just do what you can, even if it just a cold drink and a phone
call.

On my way up 395 a couple of months ago, I stopped to help a guy in a
'vert KG.  Obviously overheated and had no compression.  Managed to give
myself a nasty burn on my hand by turning it over by the generator
pulley. No obvious cause for the overheat, but the general condition of
the engine bay showed a lot of Mickey Mouse repairs.

Well, after a half hour wait we managed to get the poor thing running
(sort of) and I followed the guy to a rest-stop a couple of miles up the
road.  My suggestion was to wait for the day to cool off and nurse it
another 50 miles or so up the road to Bishop, which has a VW garage.  At
that point, I couldn't do much more so I hit the road.  I got the fellow
to civilization, gave him my best advice, and he was better off than
when I found him.  That's what AIRS is about.
