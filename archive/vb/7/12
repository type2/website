Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [WetWesties] window rubber?

Tar has been used for thousands of years.  Somethings is is hard to improve 
on such a good thing.

It cleans up easily with wd-40 and a rag.

It smells good.- Like La Brea Tar pits- which is a really neat place.

I have reused window seals that I have roofing tarred in.  Like  when I put a 
new windsheild glass in Bugster.  I reused the seal I had installed I couple 
years before.  I reused the windsheilds seals on my westy when I painted it.  
No big deal.  It is a little harder to remove seals that have it in there, 
but no big deal.

I have on occasion put a solid winsheild in my 61.   Then in summer removed 
the solid windsheild and reinstalled the safaris.  then back to solid for 
rainy weather.  Then back to safari again.

Then again, I live in what is supposed to be a rainy climate, although it has 
been dry for months this summer.  very wierd.   I am still leaving the 
safaris open in the 61, though I plan to switch to driving the westy when it 
rains.
