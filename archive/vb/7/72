I just uploaded a pic of my 21 w project to the gallery on www.vintagebus.c=
om. See Projects or search on my last name, Houck. One is~300k, thefirst =
is 67k in size.See the pearl white clip inside, looks like both corner =
beltlines are toast. Nice contrast of the pearl-white and blue-white. =
Hopefully a clip from Clara will be rolling down with Chuck Friday =
morning.
