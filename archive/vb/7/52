Great. And how were you supposed to change a tire on the side of the
road? In some states that is illegal.

You should go back, ask for the manager and be as ugly as you possibly
can. I would threaten to beat the shit out of him if his monkeys ever
did that again. Some times it is just the right thing to do. That is one
thing that really frosts my ass.
