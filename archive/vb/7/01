I'll tell you, I waited 25 years to get one of the auto darking masks, and
I'll tell you I decided to breakdown when I consedered how many times I
was a little slow getting the regular one down and decided my eyes were
worth it...

  don't know how I ever got along without the thing....!  fits in the
catagory of "one of the best tools I ever bought"  

they have a new one that uses the welding arc to recharge the battery,
slick.
