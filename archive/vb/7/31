Subject: Re: Now what?!?  69 bus tire/ brake issues

First, thanks for all the replies. I had 10 within 4 hours. Most said don't
burn it, one guy offered me matches.

I feel like an idiot. I told the guy last week that I wanted to put the
wheels on myself because I knew they would be too tight, but I was late
getting back to work and needed to get out of there. I had no idea they
could warp the drums! Damn.

I took all four wheels off. Over torqued? On two wheels it took a 24 inch
breaker bar and a 18 inch pipe extension to get the lugs off! Damn.

I re-torqued the lugs to 94 ftlb per Bentley, set the tire pressure at 30
front and 40 rear (my tools and camping gear are in there), and adjusted the
brakes. First test drive to test it showed a 50% reduction of the pulsating.
I'll call around to see who has the correct balancing machine before I have
the drums turned. Strange thing is that this same shop put the old tires on
and the new guy asked me how they balanced them last time, like I would
remember!
