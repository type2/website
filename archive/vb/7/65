Subject: Wheels straight finally!

I wanted to write in with another success story for Mag Masters. This 
morning, I picked up the two wheels I left them last week and couldn't be 
happier. They were able to fix the big ding I had in one of them and got 
most of the wobble out of the other one. They only charged me for one, since 
they had to 'eyeball' the wobbly one.

If anyone wants to contact them, the number is: (714) 541-9777 and they are 
in Santa Ana (CA) off the 55 (-at-) Edinger.

Add me to the happy customer list!
