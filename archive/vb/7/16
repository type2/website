Not trying to start anything here, but I dearly love a technical discussion.

My manuals give a BUG tranny from 1961-67 with a .89:1 4th gear and a BUS tunnel
case tranny w/RGB with a .89:1 4th gear. Same/same.

In the split case BUS tranny 4th had a .82:1 ratio. But you also ran a 36HP
engine. The lower 4th gear was needed to push the bus. The tunnel case tranny
will reduce RPMs over the split case tranny.

Maybe I'm a little dense, but can you tell me again WHY you feel this is a bad
gearing combo and will "OVERREV" an engine at 60 MPH?

Can you provide some hard numbers or am I asking to much? VW seems to think a
BUG tranny with RGBs will work, they sold them for years!
