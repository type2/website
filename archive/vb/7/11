I have a Millermatic and really like it.  It's only jammed 3-4 time in 2
years and usually that was my fault.  It is very consistant.  I do wish
the power level was more adjustable though.  It would be nice to have
infinate control on the power like you do on the wire speed.  The power
is like 4 settings I think.

That said, the wire speed does'nt change that much when I'm welding.
Below a certain point lower speed is useless (the wire burns back into
the tip too fast).

Good machine though.  Worth the 600 I think.  Now if I could only afford
a plasma cutter.  I'd take any brand....even a Linclon ;-)
