Subject: Jerome raffle bus

   Through the generosity of a few list members about every thing on the
want list (Jerome 62 Sub hatch Westy) has been covered .  A couple of items
that were not able to be covered were a rear cargo mat and a wiper motor
assembly.  Kyle (westfailure and coordinator extraordinaire) should be
pleased and for those that come to Jerome and spend their 50 cents to win
this bus will be blown away.
