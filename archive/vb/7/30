I tried that on an FMC tire balancer and the spindle wouldn't fit
through the hole in the drum.

My solution was to get an adapter made in the machine shop where I
worked at the time. The details are: 10" OD, 2.5" hole in center, 1/2"
thick plate finished to about 7/16" thick (I just had both sides cleaned
up), put 5 holes in it on the 205mm pattern with diameters and
counterbores to match whatever lug bolts you bought at your FLAPS. The
idea is to have the bolts sticking out of the plate on one side and the
bolt heads down in the c'bores on the other side. You need a flat
surface on the side with the bolt heads. Now you can mount your wheel on
the adapter for balancing on almost any modern balancing machine. Buy
lug nuts to match your lug bolts. I think it took about an hour to make
this thing, which translates to about $50.00 of shop time in TN. The
steel could be bought for almost nothing, most shops have scrap and
drops you could probably get for a couple of bucks (or beers), and the
lug nuts and bolts were about another $10.00.

This thing works great, and my tire shop doesn't even bitch about having
to use it.

Always be nice to the machinists where you work. 8^)

Doc Ric, If you're doing business with a tire shop around Knoxville, you
can use my adapter.
