You might get better results with a less agressive approach.  You
certainly should go back and talk to the manager, tell him about the
incident, tell him about how much torque it took to remove the lug nuts,
and finally tell him that his employee permanently damaged your brake drum
despite your instructions not to mount the wheels with an impact wrench
(or however you phrased it).  The remedy should be to replace the drums,
bearings and seals.

If the manager balks at this, remind him that the cost of making things
right will be far less than the cost of going to small claims court.
Suggest that he take it out of the pay of the mechanic who installed the
wheels.

If he still balks, off to court.
