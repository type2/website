Interesting.  I don't think you're losing the feed to the headlight switch
because if you were the ignition would probably cut out as well.  So you're
probably losing it somewhere between the switch and the lights, or you
might be losing the ground.

A '56 has the floor-stomp headlight dimmer, right?  Did you pull up the
mat and check the harness to it?  It doesn't usually run that close to
the shifter but it is down there on the floor.

Have you taken out either or both of the headlights and checked the
wiring inside the bucket? 
 
You might also check the ground straps from the battery to the body and 
from the transmission nose to the body.

In case you didn't know, there are wiring diagrams online at

Good luck!
