Actually a split case tranny has a slightly HIGHer r&p than the 4.375 tunnel 
case tranny.    SO when I get my truck I'll put a split case tranny, and 1.26 
RGBoxs on it.   I just want that full and complete stop to go into first 
feeling again.

 .82 is higher gearing than a .89  It has something to do with division I 
believe.   a .77 4th - which you can get aftermarket, is even higher.  People 
with fat motors sometimes get them.    THe 4th gear, is an overdrive, as it 
is a number smaller than one.  a bug 4th is good for pulling hills, being 
lower, but less speed at the same rpms.   You can put together the bad hiney 
hauling bus with 4.37 and 1.39 rgb, and bug 4th for hauling heavy loads ... 
around town.  Ya you can overrev at 60.  yup.  Get a tach.  forget trying the 
math.   You can just borrow the tach- hooked up but not installed works.  
swap trannys, and tell us how the tach readings change.
