Hi everyone! 

Since everyone was talking about deals on Busses I thought I'd add mine. I 
drive a 62 Kombi daily, but several months ago I heard of a 55 Bus not too 
far from me but was told there was no way I could get it as others had tried 
for years. Well to make a really long story short, the Bus turned out to be a 
54 Kombi, which aside from some questionable bodywork was very original 
(perfect middle and rear seats, fuel dipstick, crank, etc all still there) 
and except for the missing engine, was complete. So with the excellent help 
of my friend Tim we wrenched it out of where it sat since the mid to late 
60's. The total cost of this Bus was $80.00, the owner actually wanted 75 but 
I only had 4 20's on me, and asking for the 5 in change just seemed wrong. I 
made a crappy site with some pics I took of it and you can find them here:

Ok well anyways thats about it. I'm trying to finish my 58 Karmann Ghia right 
now, it still needs a bit more work, but I figure if I can fix that (heater 
channels, rockers, floors, quarters, lower nose, fender) then this Bus 
shouldnt be too bad. When the Ghia's done then the Bus comes next. Thanks for 
listening to my inane rambling.
