Hey All,

My boss scored a judsen from his dad and it's in good shape.  He might have 
it up for sale but believe he'd like to sell it locally.  Anyway I was 
wondering whats the maximum displacement a judsen will add performance to.  
I thinking if it's meant for a 36 horse it would probably hurt the 
performance on a 1600DP.  Could this little guy add any thing to a biger 
engine?

Thanks,

Eric
