After 5 or 6 inches of rain in one day last weekend, I finally venture to
the bus. The headlights and front of the bus are not covered by my tarp, as
she hovers 2 feet above the suface on jackstands. I glance at the headlight,
and can a faint line....
Closer inspection revela she's filled with H20! I must simply get a goldfish
before I disassemble, repaint and seal that up right, just for a 5 second
pic...
