Subject: shipping long items

Hey All,

Any ideas on how to ship something 110in?  I think it may even be to big for 
amtrak.  I need to ship some beltline trim and have it in a PVC pipe right 
now.  I heard some people bend the long piece but that seems like a bad idea 
to me.

Any help appreciated,

Eric
