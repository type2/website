So I let the truck set for a couple of weeks because
it was too hot to either work on or drive it, waited
for a nice 75 degree day like yesterday as the heat
has been oppressive here and then I got to work.  

I used a long socket as a pilot tool to line the disc
up, eyeballed it, tightened it and then spun the
flywheel while looking into the clutch assembly (with
socket removed) to make sure it was straight.  If the
clutch disc is not straight you can see it "wobble"
when you spin the flywheel and you stare straight into
it.

I slide the engine back in like butter this time.  :-)
