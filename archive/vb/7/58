After owning 2 busses in my younger days (66Kombi and 72bay), I finally found 
an old bus to purchase and enjoy.  I purchased a 56 Kombi and borrowed a 
buddy's dealer plates and drove it home.  It sat for 2 weeks while I obtained 
insurance and got plates.  I drove it for the first time at night yesterday.  
The headlights go off while the vehicle is in first gear, not at a stop, only 
while accelerating.  Shift to second (or neutral) they go back on.  Checked 
wiring this morning. All is tight, and none of it seems to be in a position 
that the shift linkage would interfere with.  The bus is converted to 12v.  
It has the original crash box trans which has a long throw into first gear.  
Have any of you run across this before?  Any help or advice is appreciated.
