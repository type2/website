You'll weld better sooner with one too.  This is because your hand will
not pull off of the starting point when you flip down the regular helmet
and then search to find where you are welding.

With the auto helmet you look at what you're going to weld and pull the
trigger...no guessing.  It made a huge difference for me.  Well worth
the money.
