I just uploaded a pic of my 21 w project to the gallery on www.vintagebus.c=
om. See Projects or search on my last name, Houck. One is ~300k, the first =
is 67k in size.  See the pearl white clip inside, looks like both corner =
beltlines are toast. Nice contrast of white and the pearl-white and =
blue-white. Hopefully a clip from Clara will be rolling down with Chuck =
