I generally listen when I fill it.  I know I look like a dork with my ear
next to the tank, but I listen for the gas to start up the filler neck
(first time you do it you'll know what I mean) and let off the pump lever
immediately.  I don't ever wait for the first automatic shut off.  I
haven't spilled gas since I started doing that.
