Subject: Sundial Style Tent 4 Sale

Now, don't contact me over this...it ain't mine!!  I just met a guy with a 
60 23-window last week who said there was a brown, red, and green Sundial 
style tent that came in his bus when he bought it.  It sounds complete and 
it sounds like a rare color combo, so I told him I'd put the word out for 
him.  Give Jeremy Smith a call at (408) 821-2462 if you're interested in 
it.  Emails to me will be ignored as I'm leaving for Mt. Lassen soon to go 
camping.
