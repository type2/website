Subject: VW show  AridZona

this all vw event will take place on april 30th 2006. I have been working
with the owner of speedworld motorplex and it is a GO. All I need now is for
some imput assistance on teh carshow side because I have little experiance
with that (Trayle this is what I was trying to get in touch with you for)
will have an 11.90 index clas as well as a Super ET bracket (12.99 and
faster) ET bracket (13.00 and slower) as well as a trophy ET class (all ET's
run together) also hoping to add some kind of STREET CAR shoot out. 15 show
classes as well as swap spaces will be available. OVERNITE camping will be
available also
