All,

I'm curious about something.

Who here does NOT have a copy of the Bentley manual for their Bus?
(There are two; '50-'62 and '63-'67)  Why not?

Who here does NOT know about the manuals online at the doc project?
( http://www.failsure.net/oacdp/ )  Why not?

Who here does NOT have an Idiot manual?  Why not?
