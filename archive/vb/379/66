Problem with this is that ever since braided hose became "kewl" we have
been flooded with braided hose that is basically junk.  I prefer a good
rubber hose made by a reputable manufacturer like Gates.

Hose clamps are not always bad either, as long as they are good quality
and the fittings have beaded ends.
