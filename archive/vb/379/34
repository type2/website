Subject: Bus sighting

On the Discovery Channel tonight there is programming called Haunting - The 
episode is about a haunted house in Baltimore - anyway - the folks being 
haunted are traveling in a mid-60's white over green bus.

And - during a commercial - a say that co-op insurance commercial for the 
first time - the one with the office in the mid-60's bus.
