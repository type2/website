For way more than you ever wanted to know about things like this, read
"Carroll Smith's Nuts, Bolts, Fasteners and Plumbing Handbook"
(Motorbooks International, 1990, ISBN 0-87938-406-9), about US$20-$25.
In brief, he used reputable makes of stainless braided hose for critical
race-car applications, but for less critical race-car stuff and all
street-car stuff, he used reputable makes of rubber hoses, barb-type end
fittings, and hose clamps.  This book was written 16 years ago and Smith
complained about the junk braided hose on the market even then.

Smith was an engineer/mechanic/crew chief for lots of different race
teams, including the Shelby GT40.  He wrote some other good books with
titles in the "$foo To Win" pattern: "Drive to Win", "Tune to Win", etc.
Allegedly he wanted to call the hardware book "Screw to Win" but the
publisher balked.
