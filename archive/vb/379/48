Subject: Re: [VB] poor milage

I have a similar experience with identical busses getting different gas
mileage :-(

Another way to look at it : if the rebuilt is going to gt 5mpg less than the
other one and assuming 60k engine life, the rebuilt engine will have sucked
1000 gallons more, or 3000$ more. You should wait a bit to see if it
improves. Otherwise now may be the time to fix it.
