Subject: Cooling Flap return spring for doghouse shroud

I placed a wanted ad, hoping to find one and the prices I got back were 
pretty high.  Has anyone used a carb spring or another generic spring on 
their cooling flaps?  I am concerned about using another spring that may 
have too much tension.

Thanks,
