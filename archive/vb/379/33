It's a little hard to see, but that's a 28 PICT-2.  Direct link to one
of the item photos: http://i10.ebayimg.com/04/i/05/87/1d/36_12.JPG

The 28 PICT has a ceramic choke cover.  The 28 PICT-1 and 28 PICT-2 have
metal ones.  Up to the mid-1966 models, Buses had the throttle return
spring over the throttle cable and against the fan shroud; later ones
had the return spring on a bracket on the carb like the one in the
picture.
