Not on an air-cooled VW.  I didn't think any of the carb numbers ever
went as high as -5; the Without Guesswork manuals at the doc project
(which cover through '72) don't have this number.

Google doesn't know much about it either.  Searching for "32 pict 5"
turns up one Web forum in Polish and nothing else.  Without the quotes,
there are a couple of hits for a company that sells rebuilt carbs and
carb kits; the only thing close they list is a 34 PICT-5, which is for a
Wabbit.  In contrast, Googling for good carb numbers like "28 PICT"
turns up lots of relevant hits.

Bentley says only 28 PICT, 28 PICT-1, or 30 PICT-1 on the Bus 1500.
