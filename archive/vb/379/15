I had that bus for about 3 years.  It almost always got 31mpg.  It didn't 
matter whether it was around town, or on a road trips.  Whether it was just me, 
or with 3 friends and all our camping crap.  I kept a log book with everything 
I ever did to the bus and when I put gas in, and it was consistantly 31mpg.  

there were two exceptions:

once it got 16mpg.  I checked the compression, found it very low in #3, 
rebuildt the heads and put new rings and rod bearings on it, back to 31mpg

The other I was with with with 3 friends and a bunch of gear going up hill to 
Yosenmite.  It got 40mpg.

It had a split case tranny with little nuts, a 1500 sp, 28 pict with the 
spring between the carb and the fan shroud,  and a bug muffler with dual pea 
shooters. No roof rack. I tended to drive at 55- 60mph on the freeway, which was 
probably revving the piss out of the engine.  I sold the bus in '92 I think.   
It had red diamond pattern naugahyde in the back and gold in the front.   I 
heard it went to Maryland.   I have a california title for it.   It was a 
originally SWR panel, that had been camperised at some point, but was pretty bare 
inside, just a welded in bed platform behind the cargo doors, and the naugahyde 
interior of course.  very 70s.  Aqua blue-green on the outside.
