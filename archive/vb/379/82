Subject: Re: [VB] Engine Tin

Hi again John,
Forgot to mention that the 1967 only bug rear (two adds have them as fronts  
;-) ) tin with the two small heat riser holes work well with either the 40  HP 
air cleaner, the early left side 1500 cc air cleaner, or the right side 1500  
cc air cleaner.  Just block off one hole in one side or the other of  the tin.
  Then you just need to find a matching tin around the front of the  lower 
pulley.
