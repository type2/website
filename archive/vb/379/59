Subject: Lifespan of a full flowed type 1 in a bus

In theory installing oil full flow filtrationi in a bus doubles the engine
life.

In practice it also adds trouble like risks to loose oil in the hoses or
fail to prime the thing properly after an oil change and run dry.

So I wonder : How many miles did you get out of your full flowed type 1
engine in a bus ?

(I know a listmember who got 0 miles on the 1776 )

I still don't know why my supposedly 26mm oil  pump is 21mm deep and 38 mm
diameter. Please help me or I'll start to believe that this list is not only
about car using compressed air, veggie oil and electricity.
