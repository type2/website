i got my braided hose at a hydraulic shop that made it up for 
tractors, trucks and high-pressure presses.  when i was done, i'd 
paid like $110 for enuff to do the job, but the stuff was rated to a 
RIDICULOUS level. i like overkill :)

lesson #1 - do NOT overtighten the AN fittings; i had a leaky one, 
ended up overtightening it; when i broke the connection the next 
time, i'm danged if i can get it tight again without going TIGHTER 
than the last time... progressive failure, i think they call it?  you 
deform the metal-to-metal surfaces each time you overtighten, leading 
to MORE leaks, more tightening, etcetc.

  anyways, weeps a bit, but holds fine otherwise.
