Why not install a 12V choke?

I'd do that, and make sure that the choke turns off.   If your choke is 
sticking on, it'll run rich.
Also, what jets are you using?   If it is jetted too rich, it'll ... run rich.

You can buy a new 30pict 1 manual choke carb.  I have on on the 1600 DP in my 
65 westy, it's lovely.  It also needed rejetting.  It came with a 120 main 
jet and it ran rich.   I dropped it down to a 115.   
about $75 from CB Performance.   

I also had to buy a choke cable  (about $30 to the door from WW) and install 
it, which involved pulling the engine, and pulling the fan shroud to drill 
holes for the choke cable.  I pulled the shroud as I didn't want to drill holes 
in the oil cooler by accident.

But maybe you just need to rejet your carb.  New main jets are available for 
about $3 ea from motorcycle shops.
