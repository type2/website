float movement fine - but what about the VALVE, the brass doohickey 
in the top? if it sticks open, gas will flood into the carb, 
regardless of float happiness.

brand new, but unadjusted? brand new, but adjusted improperly?

no guesses - it beHoovers you to take apart the beast and FIND OUT.

holding up a part and saying 'it don't work' without understanding 
how it SHOULD work  - and the numbers involved -  w ill get ya 
nowhere but stuck roadside one day.  nothing we can tell you will 
help you until you know the baseline on adjustments and jets, and 
work from there. the T2 library has some great articles that should 
get ya started.


btw, i am a FINE one to talk... as far as i'm concerned, carbs are voodoo :)
