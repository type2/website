Subject: Carb Question

I have a 63 Panel that has either a 15 or 1600 single port head with a 28 PICT 6V choke (voltage dropped from 12V). The carb is running rich, so rich I'm putting plugs in it every two weeks. I was reading some of the articles in the library and came to a conclusion that the 28 PICT is not the right carb for a 15/1600cc engine or I have some worn jets, dump tube, or something. I rebuilt the carb a couple months ago. I installed everything that comes standard in a carb rebuild kit and the bus runs good when the plugs aren't fouled, does smell of gas real bad though. Anybody have any suggestions on whether I should put in a 30 PICT 3 (H30/31) or try to get some new harder to find parts for the 28 PICT? I like the 28 although I would like to put on a manual choke.
