Subject: Re: [T2] Bluetooth in a bus?

I have used Sennheiser noise cancelling PXC-250 headphones to listen to
music in the bus and it is addictive. The noise cancellation works better
with the VW engine than in an airplane.

To cancel noise with a loudspeaker, the loudspeaker would need to be as
powerful as the noise source itself. I think the device you are pointing us
to will fail to do that. The mic. noise cancelling may work for the other
end of the call.
