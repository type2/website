Well we took 3/4 of the Laster clan tonight to see the animated film 
"Curious George". I was quite entertained, and the added bonus of 
several buses in the film made it even more enjoyable. Most were that 
distinct split window 'vee' up front. The Man in the Yellow Hat also 
spent some time in the film driving a real VW (vw emblem even) that was 
more of a truck/suv type thing. Still fun finding the buses.
