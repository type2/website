Subject: Re: [VB] Mechanical oil psi?

I have seen but never installed them.  I was afarid if a line broke I'd be 
SOL.

I have seen a very cute mechanical guage with a face that matched the speedo 
of a bus.  It tempted me, but I didn't use it.

I run an electric pressure guage in my 65.  It goes up to 70 or 80 psi.   
That's what I usually see peopel run.
