And a reminder that Berg (and likely others) still sell a heavy duty 
solex float valve that should fit just about any older solex carb, as 
well as Kadron's, for $11.

This is a more sturdy design, using a positive ball-on-float on/off, 
just about guaranteed to put an end to float bowl overfill problems 
and recommended by the offroad types.  I'm still using some 20 yr. old 
ones on my bus.
