Subject: Mechanical oil psi?

Anybody out there in dub land ever installed a mechanical oil pressure gauge in their bus. Seems like a long way to run a capillary tube, but I here they are alot more accurate than electrical oil pressure gauges. Any words of wisdom on that?

Also, the VDO mechanicle gauge I see for sale goes up to 100 psi, is this sufficient for my 63 with 15/1600 SP or do the pressures get higher than 100 psi? Thanks
