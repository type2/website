Subject: EveryBus 2006 T-Shirts Pre Order Info

Howdy. It's rolling up to EveryBus time again! One of the premier bus
events on the East Coast, the dates this year are April 20-23, and you can
find more information here:
http://www.mindspring.com/~everybus/
Once again, I have the honor and privilege of doing the official EveryBus
T-Shirts & Dash Plaques for the event. I am now taking pre-orders through
March 17th, at which point I will place the order. If you pre-order, I can
get different sizes, from Kids' Medium, up through Adult XXXL. I will have
a small number of shirts onsite, but those will be mostly L and XL, and
every year those sell out within the first half hour, so pre-ordering is
definitely in everyone's best interest.
All the prices, information, and artwork are here:

If you have any questions, just drop me an email.
I will also be printing up more Air Cooled Search & Rescue Team shirts, so
if you want one of those, I can do that as well.
Thanks, and I look forward to seeing you all there!
