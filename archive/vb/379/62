Subject: Fw: [VB] Lifespan of a full flowed type 1 in a bus

I doubt the theory of  'double life' but having a modern spin on filter as
 compared to the OG screen has to be a plus.  I don't know of any new auto
 that just has a screen on the pick-up side of the oil pump.  It also
 provides a venue for an external oil cooler if the type of VW you are
 driving or the type of driving you do warrants it.

 It is vitally important to use quality components when doing the
 installation, use high pressure steel braided hoses with the correct
 fittings, not rubber hoses and hose clamps.  I also use a Berg pressure
 release oil pump cover, the max. pressure is 55 lbs. even when the temps 
are
 down into the 30s.  As far as losing prime at oil changes the pump doesn't
 go dry same as when you drain the oil without a FF system and draining the
 oil out of the oil hoses at oil changes just disconnect the coil wire and
 spin the motor over 'til you have pressure.

 I drive a '61 Westy towing a '71 Sears trailer(heavy) loaded with camping
 gear and have over 20k miles.  2017 motor and FF tranny and ALL my miles 
are
 highway miles at 65-70 MPH, I only use my Westy for long camping trips no
 around town driving.

  In theory installing oil full flow filtrationi in a bus doubles the engine
 life.
