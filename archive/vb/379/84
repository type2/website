Hi John,
Any engine from 1938-67 (as long as it is not a type 3 engine) will bolt  
right in.  Six volt bell housing does not have to be modified, if one uses  a 
200mm six volt FW.  The big problem will be making a mount for the remote  gen 
regulator or converting to earlier gen with mounted regulator
