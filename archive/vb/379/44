Subject: poor milage

my daily driver panel has a new(aprox 1200 miles) 1600 sp in it that's only
getting 15 mpg mixed use(about 1/2 and 1/2). i'm running a new 30-pict 1 and a
stock used 69 bus distributor, which were both on the previous 1600 sp engine
installed in the bus last summer. with that engine i got 19-20 mpg mixed use
running that exact same carb and distributor, and this was in the summer with
the safari's open full tilt.
 my rings haven't seated yet, because it'll still chug slowly down my
driveway(steep grade) when i get out to lock the gate with the bus in gear.
could this be bringing my milage down?
