Subject: Re: [VB] Mechanical oil psi?

100 psi is high enough, the seals will start leaking some were around 
65+ psi that is the reason to let it warm up on cold mornings and keep 
the RPMs down until the oil pressure stays lower from warm oil.
It seams you are asking for a rub/wear leak, and that would not be good.

> installed a mechanical oil pressure gauge in their bus. Seems like a long way to run a capillary tube,  VDO mechanicle gauge I see for sale goes up to 100 psi, is this sufficient for my 63 with 15/1600 SP
