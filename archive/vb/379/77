Subject: Engine Tin

So ... I'm about to begin building a 1600 or 1641 SP for my 60.  I think I 
have a good set of heads and Rolf has a good core for me to use.  But he 
says he does not have any engine tin - I don't imagine any of the tin from 
my 1200 will work and I want to keep that motor in tact and ready to pop-in 
if necessary - so ... I'm on a hunt for engine tin.  I think I have the two 
pieces that go under the cylinders - but thats about it - anyone know of a 
site that shows what tin I'll need - or a good place from which to order the 
stuff?

TIA
