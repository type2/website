Subject: 1964 Type II Bumpers

Is there any source in North America for new reproduction bumpers.  I have
seen a few used and banged up ones on "thesamba" but most people won't ship
and everything that looks decent is on the East coast and would cost me a
fortune to take time off work to go get them.

Thanks
Dave Johansen
