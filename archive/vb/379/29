It doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility.  Some numbers are at
http://www.type2.com/library/fuel/specs.htm .

Later, Clara said it was a panel with a home-made bed welded in.  Per
the Web page above, it would have weighed in somewhere around 2500
pounds.

If you're talking about a '71 Westy, that page says it would weigh in
somewhere around 3200 pounds.  If everything else was equal (which it
isn't), if you put Clara's set-up on your Bus, you might expect
(2500/3200)*31 or 24 mpg out of your Bus.  I don't think what you're
getting is too far out of line.

Here are some numbers from VW.  These are all according to DIN 70 030,
which is: measured consumption plus 10% at half maximum load, constant
3/4 of maximum speed, and a level road.

          1200, 28 PICT, starting 1964: 25 mpg    (Bentley)
1500, 28 PICT, 3/4 ton, starting 1964: 25 mpg    (Bentley)
   1500, 28 PICT, 1 ton, starting 1964: 24 mpg    (Bentley)
1500, 30 PICT-1, 1 ton, starting 1966: 24 mpg    (Bentley)
1500, 42 and 44 bhp DIN, through 1967: 22 mpg    (1969 WoG)
            1600, 34 PICT-3, 1971 only: 22.4 mpg  (1972 WoG)
      1700, 34 PDSIT-2/3, through 1972: 18.2 mpg  (1972 WoG)

"WoG" are the "Without Guesswork" manuals at the doc project:
http://www.failsure.net/oacdp/ .  "Bentley" is the '63-'67 Bentley;
the bay Bentley doesn't seem to give mileage numbers.

Some numbers from the US EPA.  These are most likely on the "FTP 75"
(aka "EPA III") drive cycle.  The city cycle is about 11 miles of stop-
and-go driving, max speed about 57 mph, average about 21 mph.  The
highway cycles is about 10 miles of highway driving, max speed about
60 mph, average about 48 mph.

20 (17/25) means 20 mpg combined, 17 mpg city, 25 mpg highway.  For 1979
only the combined figure is given.

2000, fuel injection, manual, 1978: 20 (17/25) mpg, 50-state  (US EPA)
   2000, fuel injection, auto, 1978: 19 (17/23) mpg, 50-state (US EPA)
2000, fuel injection, manual, 1979: 17, 50-state (US EPA)
   2000, fuel injection, auto, 1979: 15, 49-state (US EPA)
   2000, fuel injection, auto, 1979: 16, California (US EPA)

PS: Bonus geek point - why do some of the lines in the 1978-1993 EPA fuel
economy guides have funny characters at the far left?
