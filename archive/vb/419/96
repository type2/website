Subject: Re: [T2] Hubcap?

OK, from another post, this last known hand off was at a show in Tulsa,
correct? Can someone find and post the date and name of that show at least?
That would help with finding people who were at that show. Even a year would
be a good start.
Other than that, since our last known owner won't say who he gave it to, can
he at least contact that person and find out who they gave it to? Or perhaps
point them here or to the thread on Samba:

Let's find this thing!
