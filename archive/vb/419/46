Couple years ago Leah and I made plans to go well out of our way to  
take it off a guys hands down in Texas or somewhere down there.  We  
offered to drive more than half the distance and he would take care of  
the rest.  In the end, he didn't want to let it go.  Our plans were to  
get it to the Denver area where there were others that would be  
heading West.

Peace, Troy
