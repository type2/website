Subject: re:rear hatch hinge repair & creaks

I had a quick question about the rear hatch-mine creaks every time I open
it. I can't quite figure out where the squeak is coming from, or what is
causing it.

Is there anyway to eliminate the squeak? Or is that just part of the
mechanism? 

I'm thinking it has something to do with the way it works, and maybe I need
to put oil somewhere, and that the squeaking is probably indicating a
wearing away of metal-that may eventually wear away.
