Such a simple question and all the replies put a smile on my face this 
morning.

Hey, the box idea is nice. And Ron, thanks for the offer of a hubcap. Now 
with all the high tech maps on the internet, the location could be tracked 
for all to see. Of course the current handler must be willing to put a 
marker on a map somewhere. Maybe Frappr would work? How about using one of 
the photo sites for documenting the journey?

I could be the photo master, send me the photos and I will post them and 
keep the lists updated.

I supplied the original one, and would be glad to provide a replacement to
continue the tradition if the original is lost.
