Subject: door hardware

I am still plugging away on the resto of my bus-you might remember the first
paint job was far from correct. I've got it at a better shop, that is a body
specialist. He has been pretty good so far, basically letting me use the
shop space and me doing the prep work-as much as I can, which entails
scuffing a lot of paint! I have been putting in a couple hours a week, and
have finished the inside, and that is now ready to paint. 

On to my question-the front doors can come apart into a top section and a
bottom section. The top section has a bar across it that is held to the top
section with 4 flat head screws and nuts. Mine were pretty rusted out, and
snapped during removal. I have 2 of them left. I would like to replace all 4
with the same style as the original. The head of these screws seems a little
oversized, and I think that is important for sitting correctly. I've been to
a few local hardware stores without any luck matching this screw-or even
getting close.

Does anyone know what this screw type is, ie thread and pitch? 

Thanks,

-Kevin
