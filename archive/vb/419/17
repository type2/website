Subject: floor installation

I will be installing a new cargo floor in my 66.

Q: does the cargo floor ride on top of the seal channel on the outter
rocker?? I am replaceing the rocker and strengthener and I believe they
weld together ad the top. 

By the way, I replaced the cab floor with a new one from CIP1 and it
fits like a glove.  very nice.
