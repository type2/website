Subject: Starting Restoration

Guys,



Haven't posted much hear but always read.  I have a 66 Caravelle that I
am restoring and needed some advice before I make the big purchase.  I
need to buy all the seals, lights, cables, wiring harness blah blah blah
for it.  I have replaced all the rust already with metal from Gerson and
want to finish the rest of the bus nicely.  CIP has great deals running
now but I have never bought from them only bought limited items from
Wolfsburg west or Gerson directly.  Where should I spend my money?



THANKS
MIKE
