Thanks for the clarification on the conditions of when the pop occurs,
and good catch on the carb gasket, but a pop on decel is called
wrapdown and is a symptom of a leak at the exhaust manifold.

 One thing I didn't mention, but now I think it's important is that the bus
 only time this backfires is when I'm slowing down.  For example I'm in the
 city and rarely get out of third gear.  So when the RPM's decrease as I come
 to a stop, I will get a pop.  I'm not using the transmission to slow the
 bus.

 I did notice a slight decrease in RPM when I sprayed the carb cleaner at the
 base of the carb, so a new gasket may be in order.
