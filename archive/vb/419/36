Subject: RE: [VB] Starting Restoration

Where are you? Funny that you'd have a caravelle .. I found a 62 in a
wrecking yard in eastern Ontario .. I grabbed a fair amount of stuff from it
.. 

In my opinion ... look at what each supplier sells. For example, Ronnie at
type2parts.com sells bearings .. you can select among a number of different
manufacturers of bearings .. you can get Canadian, German, French etc..
while CIP1 sells the cheapest bearings available and does not stock the
better quality bearings .. it sounds like they have great deals .. until you
have to start redoing stuff ... 

You have a question .. I have never had an occasion when Ronnie from
type2parts.com would not speak to me on the phone .. CIP1 has nothing to say
to me .. the person on the phone just does not know about buses .. once I
ordered outriggers from them. I was in my yard with a welder buddy and he
was going to weld in the new outriggers .. damn .. it was the wrong one ..so
I called them and they would not agree that they shipped the wrong part
..just wouldn't .. even when I measured it they argued that I measured
incorrectly.

I like Wolfsburg West .. but they are more expensive than Ronnie and .. if
you call you might not get someone who knows buses ...
