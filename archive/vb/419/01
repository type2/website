Subject: Rear hatch hinge repair.

Hi,

Just had the opportunity to repair the left hinge assembly on my friend's bus.
Hi lives a couple blocks away and knocked on my door and explained that one of
the hinge pins had sheared off. So we went out and looked at my bus and
figured out the pin diameter. I found some scrap 5/16 dia. A2 rod, cut off a
piece about .94 long, chucked it up in my drill press and cut snap ring
grooves at each end with my handy hack saw. He took the part home and couldn't
get it in. Showed back up on my doorstep for a little more help. Turns out
that the bushing in the hinge arm had been totaled and the sheet metal had cut
thru the original pin. Soooo, I went back to the junk box and found some
oilite bushing with a 7/16 OD and 5/16 ID, cut it off to about .35" long,
popped it into the remaining hinge metal. Got a long screw driver to pry down
the hinge and line up the holes. Slipped the new pin into place put on the
snap rings and Woweee, satisfied friend. His hatch now runs up and down smooth
as you please.  His job now is to find an original pin anyone have those?

Cheers!
Chris
