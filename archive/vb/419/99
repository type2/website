I doubt it based on what's viewed in ETKA 7's Mexico Beetle Production
listings for D (1200), H (1500) and AF (1600) engine listings thru end of
production (2004), VW # 040 109 309 1 is utilized, which is the same as the
113 109 309 C mechanical follower, just an updated/superseded number.  But I
could be wrong, ratio-wise - they could be the same or not.  The Waterboxer
engine is essentially the same design, with coolant "jackets", but the
camshafts are different (even though when sitting side-by-side they look the
same).

ACD series engines appear to have the hydraulic lifter, VW # 043 109 309,
but still use the same rocker arm.

Pushrod lengths vary as well -

H, AF (1500/1600) w/mechanical followers use a 043 109 301 A, 282mm in
length (original VW # was 311 109 301 A, which is the number that's still
normally sold under by many vendors).

ACD (1600) w/hydraulic followers use a 043 109 301, 273mm in length.
