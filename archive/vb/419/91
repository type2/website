Subject: Re: [VB] door hardware

I happen to have a couple of loose ones.
They appear to 8mm x 1.25, flat head, phillips.
Buy new ones. My spares are a little long in the tooth.

On to my question-the front doors can come apart into a top section and a
bottom section. The top section has a bar across it that is held to the top
section with 4 flat head screws and nuts. Mine were pretty rusted out, and
snapped during removal. I have 2 of them left. I would like to replace all 4
with the same style as the original. The head of these screws seems a little
oversized, and I think that is important for sitting correctly. I've been to
a few local hardware stores without any luck matching this screw-or even
getting close.

Does anyone know what this screw type is, ie thread and pitch?

Thanks,

-Kevin
