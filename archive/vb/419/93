Regular lifters.

You do need to adjust the valves.

The funny thing is the adjuster screws are fatter than what I am used to.

Also, the nuts are 15mm.

I have heard good things about the new Mexi-motors.?? My Dad put one in his 63 SC in April 2008, replacing a worn out big bore 40hp.?

These are some questions I'd love to hear the answers to!
