Subject: Re: [VB] Backfire Problem

One thing I didn't mention, but now I think it's important is that the bus
only time this backfires is when I'm slowing down.  For example I'm in the
city and rarely get out of third gear.  So when the RPM's decrease as I come
to a stop, I will get a pop.  I'm not using the transmission to slow the
bus.

I did notice a slight decrease in RPM when I sprayed the carb cleaner at the
base of the carb, so a new gasket may be in order.
