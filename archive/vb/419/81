Subject: Re: [T2] New Hubcap?

Just my 2 cents here talkin. I started up this new hubcap broohaha, (haa haa 
haa, a little Firesign humor). I would like to see something moving around. 
Whether its a hubcap or other item, it should be common to both splits and 
bays. The original hubcap would be nice, but let's not obsess too much on 
that. I think the whole point is to keep the community alive, talking and 
excited about something. This is a hobby/lifestyle.

Let's contact Hot VW's and see if they can put something in the Mag to help 
us locate the missing cap. Unfortunately they seem to have a long lead on 
magazine articles. It may take 2-3 months for publishing. Fasterlaster's web 
find might be helpful in writing an article what with the photos and all.

If there is some consensus, I will contact Hot VW's and see what their 
thoughts and schedule might be and report back to the lists.

BUS Content. I need to have the driver side rear corner repaired on my bus. 
Any suggestions for a good shop in the Los Angeles South Bay area?

What is the valve configuration on the VW Mexico engines? Hydraulic or 
standard lifters?
