Subject: Fantastic weather forecast for BNNTA!

Hi everyone,

Just checked with www.weather.com for the latest forecast for the Labor Day
weekend for the BNNTA Camping weekend.  Earlier this week the long range
forecast initially called for 30% chance of occassional showers most of the
weekend.  Not a real problem, as we VW campers are a resilient bunch, and a
little rain wouldn't melt our VWs or us.

Well things have DEFINITELY changed for the better!  Weather.com is now
predicting:

Friday        mostly sunny, high 81, low at night 58!!!
Saturday    sunny, high 80, low 59!
Sunday      partly cloudy, high 79, low 60!
Monday      30 % chance of showers, high 79, low 60!

Wooooo Hoooo!  Should be a GREAT weekend weather-wise now, low temps and
humidity!!!  Bring a sweat shirt for the evenings, great outdoor sleeping
weather.  Keep the umbrella in the VW though, because if you bring it, we
won't need it!

So if you weren't already doing so, pack up your VW with camping supplies
tonight and get on the road to Mark Twain Lake to join all of us.  There are
already 6 or 7 Buses camped there right now with many more to come in
tommorrow and Saturday.  I leased the whole campground for the long holiday
weekend, and there will be plenty of room for everyone who wants to join us.
No reservations are needed or taken in advance for this Volkswagen camping
event, we'll register you upon arrival in the "group campground" in the Indian
Creek Recreational Area right on 22 mile long Mark Twain Lake in Northeast
Missouri.

Take a backroads route and enjoy some Americana while you're on your way!  We
hope to see you soon!  Drive safely!
