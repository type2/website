Subject: Re: [VB] re:rear hatch hinge repair & creaks

Kevin,
Look carefully at the multi-link hinge mechanism. Oil each of the pivot 
points. Also the torsion bars run thru some plates just above the hinges. 
Oil those points also. Haven't looked at my torsion bars in some time as 
they are covered up, but they could possibly be rubbing against one another.
A spray can of oil is a little messy, but makes for an easy job. For jobs 
like this I have an ancient spray can of motorcycle chain oil with moly 
sulfide.

Kevin asked:

I had a quick question about the rear hatch-mine creaks every time I open
it. I can't quite figure out where the squeak is coming from, or what is
causing it.

Is there anyway to eliminate the squeak? Or is that just part of the
mechanism?

I'm thinking it has something to do with the way it works, and maybe I need
to put oil somewhere, and that the squeaking is probably indicating a
wearing away of metal-that may eventually wear away.
