If no one else steps up, shall we appoint Troy to be our front man?
Let's keep Vintagebus in the loop too.

Chris



I'd be willing to give him a call if someone else isn't already  
planning to. Not sure if we could go to pick it up though.  Is there  
anyone in the area here on the list?

Peace, Troy
