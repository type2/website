IIRC, it made it to Buses by the Bridge or Jerome and we were hopeful  
that it was going to make all the way to the left coast. Then some  
FOOL gave it to a driver headed east.  Kinda lost interest at that  
point. After ten years kicking around the southeast US of A it was  
headed for (I don't know...) Alabama or some such.

Never heard of it after that.  Probably got left in some bus that went  
to the boneyard.
