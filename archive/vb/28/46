Subject: Friday musings, Buses & Harleys

Ahhh, Friday!
Let me start by saying that I am not now, nor have I ever been a motorcycle rider. Down the street from me there are a couple of guys who are Harley Davidson bikers. Nice enough guys, but those bikes used to just kill me.  They go rumbling by all night making ALL THAT NOISE! I have never understood the appeal of the Harley. Then last night a buddy came over to the house to show me his "new" Harley soft tail. It was loud, way too expensive, and he says that you really have to baby them and give them a lot of maitenance attention. So I asked him why not spend HALF the money, get a honda or kawasaki bike in better shape that requires less maintenance and runs quieter.  To which he promptly responded: "Well, why don't you get a Ford Aerostar or Plymouth Voyager Mini-van that runs quieter, is more reliable, and requires less maintenance than all those VW buses?!?!"   Ahhhhhhh, NOW I GET THE HARLEY APPEAL!!!  It's about style, it's about truth, it's about hitting the open road and b!
eing different!  If I ever decide to buy a motorcycle, I think I'm gonna get a Harley!
