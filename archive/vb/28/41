As long as we're recycling old jokes:

We hear that there was a terrible tragedy recently in Afghanistan.  It
seems that a group of eight al Qaeda terrorists on a weekend pass to
Kabul were traversing a high mountain pass in an old splitty Neunsitzer
when the steering gave out on a hairpin curve.  The bus swerved over the
side and plunged down a 2000-ft canyon and all were killed.

The tragedy was that there was an empty seat...
