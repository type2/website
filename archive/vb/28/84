Subject: front torsion bars from VW?

Hello Everyone,

Awhile ago there was a thread about the part#s for the front torsion 
springs.  It was concluded that the same part was used from 1955 up to 1970 
(211 411 033), and I think I recall someone mentioning that they were still 
available from VW.  I called my local dealership, and read them the part 
number, and they couldn't find anything on them.  Does anyone have 
experience getting the springs new from VW, and if so, what part number did 
you give to the guy behind the counter so that he could find it on the 
computer?  Do they have to type it in with the spaces in there (211 411 033 
vs 211411033)?  Is there some kind of prefix/voodoo/secret code?  Or are 
they really just NLA (sigh)?

TIA,

Mike A.
