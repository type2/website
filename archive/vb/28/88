 where do you live?  I have an extra stepped crank FW 6V small clutch, you 
could have free, but are you going to be at the Puyallup show on Oct 14th

 Thanks to many of you here on the list, I have learned that the 40 HP engine 
i picked up to replace the destroyed 1500 engine in the '64, cannot use the 
same flywheel from the 1500.  I guess I should have done my research BEFORE I
