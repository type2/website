There are two interesting articles linked from CNN.com's main page today....

The one that really raised my eyebrows indicates that the Taliban may
(perhaps) be starting to lose its control over Afghanistan, due to
members'/supporters' fear of US attack, with the possibility of the country
descending into anarchy.

The second explains rather concisely why so many in that region hate us in
the first place.
