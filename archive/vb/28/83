 When i let out my clutch and the bus begins to move
 forward i get a loud and solid clunk from the rear. I
 also experience  my shifter moving as i let off the
 gas. Here is a list of what i have done so far:
 All new mounts (bell housing and nose cone)
 Checked bolts at redux box to spring plate
 new shift coupler
 new clutch(heavy duty)
 new pressure plate (200mm)
 Checked all lug nuts
 checked the rear axle nuts
 I am going to yank it out tonight to replace the Gland
 nut and polish up the shaft.
 Short of buying a new tranny, are there any other
 ideas?
 Thanks,
 Sean

Double check your spring plate to RGBox bolts.  (I know you already did, but 
do it again)

Check your front mount.  You say it is new- check it anyway.  One way is you 
open the engine compartment and grab the top of the fan shroud and pull 
back..   The engine should not move.  

The shifter jumping makes it sound like a bad front mount.  New ones can go 
bad.

I had a big clunk from the rear in the 59 SC I had- i also pulled a big piece 
of metal out of the tranny oil when I first changed it- looked like fulcrum 
plate so I figgured it was thrashed fulcrum plates.  Would thunk unless I was 
real easy giving it gas and real easy when I let up on the gas.   If I jacked 
up one real wheel and left it in gear (e brake off) i could spin the wheel 
soomewhat and hear it thunk in the center section.  This does not make the 
shifter jump though.   I meant to fix it, but then sold the truck, told the 
next owner about it.  Kinda regret selling Truck.

ps, what size motor do you have?  if you have a fat motor it can break front 
tranny mounts.
