Subject: Break in oil, cool weather considerations?

Need to break in a 1600 SP in the next three weeks. Currently sitting
happily in my storage garage, getting turned my hand once a week, with some
oil in cyls.
What oil should I use to break in, assuming it will be like 40F outside,
maybe high 30s (if I am unlucky). After the break in, what weight would be
good for road break in, then storage for winter in the garage? Not proabable
to do more than 150 miles before storage.

TIA,
AL
