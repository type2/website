F 0 590 078 is a 1300 engine originally from a '66 Beetle.  Probably
produced between December 1965 and July 1966.  The leading "O"
may indicate that the crankshaft bearings are at least the first 
oversize - VW said to mark engines with an "O below the engine
number" when oversize bearings are installed, and it may have gotten
marked at the front of the engine number.  If that leading "O" is
really two little arrows, then that's an "exchange" mark.
