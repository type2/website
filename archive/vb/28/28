You might look into the converted motors that SoCal Imports is selling.

I am going to convert Frodo my 65 Westy to 12 volt when I build my new
motor this winter. Instead of trying to do the drop down resistor for
the wiper motor I would like to use a 12 wiper system. Could somebody
give me an idea on what parts I need to do this. My current system is
bone stock.
