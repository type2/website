Subject: FW: [VB] Friday musings, Buses & Harleys




But my 40 year old singlecab still runs more reliably and cheaper than the average Harley,probably will cost less to restore too.

A drinking establishment I frequent is populated by bikers and they make fun of "the Harley riders" that pull up to the cruise area in their stiff shiney leathers,go to the coffee shop to get their double frapamocanutbag latte and dial up their broker on the cell while sitting with the trophy wife on the sidewalk patio.

You can kind of relate some of the people that ride Harleys for the image it projects to the KEWL VW kids that prime and lower their VW the minute it first hits the shop.Might be a good idea to have a jetting clinic for them too as most that thunder by my place seem to run rich enough that I could pipe their exhaust into my intake and run off their unburned fuel.

Don't get me wrong,a well tuned Harley of vintage is a cool thing but for know I would rather be WFO and use the Grim Reaper as my braking marker.

Ahhh, Friday!
Let me start by saying that I am not now, nor have I ever been a motorcycle rider. Down the street from me there are a couple of guys who are Harley Davidson bikers. Nice enough guys, but those bikes used to just kill me.  They go rumbling by all night making ALL THAT NOISE! I have never understood the appeal of the Harley. Then last night a buddy came over to the house to show me his "new" Harley soft tail. It was loud, way too expensive, and he says that you really have to baby them and give them a lot of maitenance attention. So I asked him why not spend HALF the money, get a honda or kawasaki bike in better shape that requires less maintenance and runs quieter.  To which he promptly responded: "Well, why don't you get a Ford Aerostar or Plymouth Voyager Mini-van that runs quieter, is more reliable, and requires less maintenance than all those VW buses?!?!"   Ahhhhhhh, NOW I GET THE HARLEY APPEAL!!!  It's about style, it's about truth, it's about hitting the open road and!
 b!
eing different!  If I ever decide to buy a motorcycle, I think I'm gonna get a Harley!
