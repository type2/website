Hi Terry,
Two ways to go.
1. 1965 one year only 12 volt wiper motor (211 955 113 C which was a rare 
M-code/accessory part to begin with.

2.  Find a electric motor shop that will do small motor rewinding.  Find out 
how much for doing one, fifty, or even a hundred.  If the cost drops 
signifigantly have everyone who has a 1965 bus send you the needed wiper 
motor core and $!
