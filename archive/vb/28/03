Hey there Volks,

Just wanted to introduce myself. I've been lurking on the web
reflector for awhile doing "research", and for the past few months
I've been lurking in digest mode.

I've been a member of the type2 list since 1998. My current bus is a
79 westy. Yes, I drive a "fat chick" bus. I had a 78 westy before
that. I'm 35 yrs old, single, and employed as a computer programmer.
I've always been interested in getting a split window bus, but
because of my living situation (condo assoc. is a real pain about
"extra" vehicles), I haven't been able to follow thru w/ my plans of
buying a splitty project.

I just bought a house (closed on it yesterday). It has a 2 car
garage, and a private 1/2 acre lot. Read private as: I can stick a
few projects in the back w/o the neighbors complaining. With
somewhere to store a project, and a garage to work in, I'll finally
be able to "go vintage". I'll also be able to get some things done on
the 79 that I didn't want to tackle in the condo parking lot.

I'll be looking for a single cab, kombi, or standard project from the
New England area. I have entertained the idea of shipping a bus (or a
"fly in drive out" deal) from a rust free area, but I think I'm gonna
see what I can turn up locally first. Hmmm.... There is that 67 SC
for sale up in NH on thesamba.com, but rust in the treasure chest
kinda scares me.

Thanks for the daily dose of vintagebus Q and A that has helped me
learn alot about vintage buses w/o actually ever owning one.

Later...
