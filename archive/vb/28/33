Hi AJ,
OK!  Sounds like you have bug/KG tires and rims, which would need 165SR15 
radials.  If so go ahead and use the old bias ply tires if you are only 
trailering this bus!  Not tow dolly, not tow hitch!  We know of a low mileage 
OG late 50s panel that was recently flipped at least three times due to use 
of a tow dolly after the new owner was told to only use a trailer.  ;-(    If 
the bias tires are really bad, once the bus is on the trailer deflate the 
tires to prevent them from loosing air or perhaps blowing out even on the 
trailer and loosening the tie down chains.  Reinflate when you get to where 
you need to and roll it off the trailer.
   If you do not think they will work for even getting the bus onto and off 
the trailer find a local friendly VW fanatic and see if they have a set of 
bus or bug/KG wheels to loan you.  Some volks will loan you the wheels off 
thier VWs!  Eric&Barb
