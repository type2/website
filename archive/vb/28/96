 Just because people love America and want to defend
it doesn't make them racist, right-winged,
parinoid, klan-loving, Lynard-Skynard-listing, pro
wrestling-watching, rebel flag-waving, Rush Limbaugh
bumper-sticker-owning, wheel-well-cutting,
side-scoop-sportin', gun-rack in every car drivin',
closet-bay-window-lusting, chrome/mirrored sunglasses-
wearin', John Wayne movie-watchin',
orginal-paint-sandin', bored-out-of-their-mind LOSERS.


 You who are prolly a dirty feet having, no deodorant
wearing, hairy armpitted having girlfriend, tree
hugging, recyle bins on your roofrack having, dogs
living in your bus, allergic to soap, dont know what
water is for except for your bong smoking hippie ass. 
 
 I have a confederate flag on my wallet, love John
Wayne, drive OG paint turkis kombi, with wheel wells,
no gun rack, listen to Rush sometimes, and not
ashamed. Go back to the rainbow family fest.
