 jesus. why are people so stupid? >>

why should we "ASSume" he's been removed when he's been making posts like 
that for the past 2 weeks or so and nothing's been done about it?

And what' s with you and you total inability to function in society where 
everyone of your posts like this seems to relate to how everyone else is "so 
stupid" and has "no bloody common sense"

oh, and before the shit hits the fan, you get to call us all stupid and tell 
us we have no common sense and then close the thread and threaten to remove 
anyone from the list if they respond......very nice....very.  You wont get 
very far by calling evenyone stupid...not very far at all
