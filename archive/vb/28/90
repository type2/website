Subject: Re: [T2] Friday musings, Buses & Harleys

Ok. Since it's Friday and all.

I useta own a Hardley Ableson.  A '68 Sportster.  Spent all winter beefing
up the engine and it was running real good.  Until I got lost in a real bad
neighborhood in DC about 3am and it decided to puke the engine innards.
Lesson #1 in heavy modifications - not worth it in the real world.  Lesson
#2 is don't go into such places unarmed.

FFWD to many years later, tired of riding fast plastic but still riding
20k/year.  Traded a carb rebuild on a 1942 Packard for a frame and 3 milk
crates in the corner of the guys garage.  Assembled a 1964 BMR R69S from
those parts.  Rode it a year, was "given the opportunity" to have to
disassemble it because of an accident.   Sold my GSXR1100 and bought a 76
BMW and have ridden those 2 same bikes for the last 13 years.  The 76 has
over 250k miles, and I still haven't had to open the engine up.

Screw the Hardley image thing, if you want a bike that resembles your
beloved bus look hard at an older BMW.  You won't be sorry.
