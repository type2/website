Subject: Re: [VB] gearbox choice

Hello

It's 5 am over here so my "brain" is sleeping :-)

I'm considering to change my rear & front axle on my 64 splitbus out with 6=
9 baywindow axles. But i'm confused regarding the gearbox on the 69 (Baywin=
dow).
Should I used the baywindow gearbox with my 1900 engine or should I buy a b=
ug 67 (1500) gearbox ?

I would like to get a continuing speed at approx 75-80 miles (120-128 kmph)=
 ? And what would it be if I also would like to could pull caravan ?

The .82 fourth gear=20
will be the faster of the two.   Eric&Barb
