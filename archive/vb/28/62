Subject: list usefulness vs. garbage

Citrus PunchDear list,
I am signing off the list for a while until things either get back to the
normal bus info./banter or someone decides that a vintage bus list is no
longer useful and we should instead have a list for ranting about killing
people....in which case I will sign off permanently. Thanks for all the
great tips and stories over the last couple of years. See you all at some VW
event!
