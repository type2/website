Well since it is Friday :)

Les is right on the money...  I am not aware of the article he is referring
to specifically, but on CBS's 60 Minutes or 48 Hours this week they showed
the last interview with Osama Bin Laden.  Of course an analyst familiar with
the middle east culture translated the conversation and the translator said
that Bin Laden basically thinks we, Americans, are shniz and does not see a
difference between targeting military, civilian, women, or children.  Why,
because Bin Laden sees us, Americans, as all economic fighters working
against his people.  I thought that perspective was very interesting, since
we pay taxes to support the military and government  Bin Laden claims we are
all fighters for the US.  

YOU are a target!  YOU are marked for death by Bin Laden!

Now what are WE going to do about it..?  I think this posses such a threat
to the American lifestyle (read freedom) that we must defeat Bin Laden and
the Taliban and eliminate it for good.  If innocent civilians get killed in
the process over there then that is what has to happen, that is war folks.
Bin Laden has been placing military targets next to schools and hospitals,
if he wants to play that way so be it.

Like the old saying goes "kill or be killed".
