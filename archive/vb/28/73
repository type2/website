Subject: RE: [VB] New listee announcement!

My 14 year old daughter (ok, 12 when it happened) helped me pull the engine
from the double cab when I first got it and started the restoration... Now,
she's eyeing my old 66 bug for her high school car but she fully understands
that she needs to be fully involved in getting it back on the road in order
for her to drive it.  My six year old boy just learned how to measure screw
pitch on bolts the other night...

Get your kids involved today!!!
