Subject:  question on deluxe rear seat/luggage bar

Greetings All,

It's seat reupholstery time for my 23 window
resto and I have a question.

I have a 'normal' rear seat to which I want to attach
the aluminium luggage bar.  Do seats that originally
came with the bar have some extra metal brackets
or tabs on the frame that the bar attaches too?
(I suspect they do but maybe not?)

If so,  would anyone have a pic of a deluxe
rear seat frame showing the extra brackets/tabs whatever?
(I've checked all tyhe galleries and couldn't see one...)

Thanks

RobK
