Subject: On a lighter note

   Yesterday I had a nice visit from a couple from VERMONT, driving there
split bus cross country eventually ending up in the Nor Cal, Sacto/Lake
Tahoe area. It's nice to see people using there buses and not being afraid
of driving them cross country with all there possessions in it. There trip
has been very uneventful except for an overheating problem once they reached
this area (Havasu Hell, still over 100 degree's daily), They came in asking
for a fuel pump and after a little discussion, I figured out they had
overheated on the hills, explains loss of power. Retarded there timing a
little then discovered that the dizzy shaft was about waiting to come apart
and that the advance was totally out of wack and erratic. The owner had a
used dizzy which he installed in front of my shop, I went out and did the
time by ear thing I do (told him to bury his timing light or let the pit
bull with them use it as a toy) and off they went, no more overheating and
pinging. I printed out the AIRS list for them (so and nor cal) so if they
had another problem they have a list of people to call. So if you see a
Blue? and white with the biggest cut wheel wells I have ever seen honk or
wave, they are traveling route 99 north.
