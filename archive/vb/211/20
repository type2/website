Subject: re:"Slightly Custom"...

I laughed at that line as well. Anytime you do something that can't be
unbolted and changed back to stock it is no longer "slightly custom". I
so however love that bus. If I could in anyway scrounge that type of
cash I would go for it. The thing looks amazing. I would guess it would
drive great but that would have to be seen first. I even thought about
selling my Thing and Double Cab to get it but they are way to useful to
live without. I would also be using it for sailing and mt. biking and I
can't really picture loading muddy bikes in the back of that. Very cool
ride in my opinion but I would change that slightly custom line.
