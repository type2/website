Thanks for the quick reply guys.  Yes I did wash the parts so that's no
help and indeed this is the original motor out of a 60K (gulp) T3 that
literally a little old lady had owned.  It sat for 20 years and I'm sure
I'm the first person to ever yank the motor.  I'm just replacing seals
and cleaning it up and running it. 

In one of my books it says that typically a replacement PP will have a
white paint mark on one edge and to install that mark 180 degrees from
the factory balancing drilling holes on the flywheel.

Thanks for the input I appreciate it! 

Steve
