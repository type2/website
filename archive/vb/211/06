Lots of differences between years. Just by looking at those 6 pics you can narrow it down to a couple of
years. Pic 4 and 6 definitely makes it a 68.

Look at the wheels:  wide 5 were 68-70 [small 5 started in 71]
Look at the side markers: round were 68-69 [rectangular started in 70]
Look at the tail lights: small oval were 68-71 [long rectangular started in 72]
Look at the bumpers: round were 68-72  [rectangular started in 73]
Look at the front turn signals: 68-72 were just above the bumper [73 up were above the headlights]
Pic 4 shows the pushbutton door handle: same as 64-67  [lever action started in 69]
Pic 5 shows the gauges: 68-73? have silver centers [74? up are all black]
( I cannot see the upper brake reservoir, but that is another tell-tale item. 68 is kidny shaped and has a
metal tube down to the lower reservoir. 69-70 was round with a plastic tube)
Pic 6 shows the wiper arms: 68-only are like 67 and back, they clamp on to a shaft. [69 and up use a splined
shaft with a nut on the end]
Look at the front turn signals: 68-72 were just above the bumper [73 up were above the headlights]
What you don't see is the key blank code: L code is 68-70, same as 67. R code started in 71.

There are other differences, these are just the ones I noticed from the pics.
