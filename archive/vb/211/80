This bus proves the theory of non locality.  Some guy at my work (NBC)
out here on the West coast painted his 13 window deluxe the exact same
color!  I almost had a heart attack when he drove it in sans windows
with that clown green below the belt line.  A week before it was a
beautiful sea blue/blue white...I'm sure he thinks its an improvement. 
Just my opinion, but yuck!
