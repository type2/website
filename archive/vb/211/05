Subject: RE: [VB] upper  engine bolt.  aaargh (fwd)

People have wondered what to do about the upperleft engine fasterner.

Two easy ways,both require the threaded insert be installed on the engine.

1:Use a longer mounting bolt and drill a hole in a spare 17mm headed nut.Install this nut on the longer bolt and install.When getting close to snug make sure the nut is oriented correctly in the notches n the trans case,finish tightening.If you want put a washer between the nut and bolt so the next time you R&R the engine the socket will not orient on the nut when the nut and bolt line up during R&R.

To R&R this bolt I use a long extension and universal joint.

2:Use a socket head cap bolt(allen head).The round head will not interfear with the notches in the trans case.For these I use a ball end 1/2 drive hex wrench.
