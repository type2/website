I just never thought it was that big of a problem.
you need to be a bit of a contortionist and may be sore after but
crawl under and push bolt through.
back in engine compartment
reach around and over and get the nut started. You can do it as long as
the bolt and nut are clean and easy. you can hold the bolt from slipping
back with a flat screwdriver. I just do it by hand and if it slips I reach
under and push it back in.
clamp a vise grip or stick a box wrench on the
nut. back under get a socket and right extension and you can tighten it.
You may want to ware glasses or goggles as the tranny will be invariably
dropping greasy dirt rign in your eyes.

If youre luck enough to have the captive nut on the engine you can delete
half of the steps.
