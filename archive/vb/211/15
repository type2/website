  It is not a European model, they did not have wind vent windows that
opened. Also the 68 Euro have a steel dash with just top padding. I have a
68 Euro pop top camper (original GD on tour bus) won a trophy at BBB VII

Well its a 68. odd combination of mix and match interior.
Looks like a european/canadian small poptop on there which could possibly
be a graft. looks to have westy type wood kick panels but an assortment of
passenger interior panels and seats.
Did you get a bad deal?
well the parts I see arent in too bad shape visually....
If its not rotten in the places you cant see and if most of the parts are
there to reassemble it then maybe its not such a bad deal.
