Subject: Re: [VB] upper  engine bolt.  aaargh (fwd)

 file washers specially to fit, so then the washers take up the wierd space 
and the bolt fits on normally.  then you can use a socket on the bolt.  I 
have something like this in my 65

My old 59w/split case tranny was easy to pull the engine out of/install.   
none of this silly doghouse stuff.  used bolts with hexes  for both upper 
bolts.   Get bolt through, go to other side, start nut.  put vise grip on 
nut.  go under bus and tighten bolt with cight combo of extension.  for by 
the starter it took a long of extension.

 On my '59, the transmission is notched for the bolt head so it doesn't
 spin when you nut it from the engine side.  I put in a new 1776 that I
 built (with doghouse and threaded case for that bolt), and couldn't
 figure out why I was having such trouble putting the bolt in from the
 tranny side once I got it into the threads.  Obviously, it slipped into
 the notched arena.  I was able to get it fairly tight, though I feared
 breaking off the head... Now, fastforward to my recent pulling of the
 engine....  I couldn't get anything onto the bolt.  I was about two tries
 away from trying to cut the thing off when the wrench finally grabbed the
 ear of the bolt head and started a 20 minute journey to get it out.  It
 wasn't until I actually had it spinning that I realized what the whole
 problem was. 
 
 Any thoughts beyond filing the bolt head area of the tranny down?  I
 don't see a problem, but am open to other suggestions.
