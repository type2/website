Subject: Need splitty seats and live near KY??

I know of a barn crammed full of split window seats in kentucky, it's just a
shame to see them go to waste, there is also bay window seats in there. I only
seen around 10% of the seats in there because they were so crammed packed. He
sold me a middle seat for my 67 bus for 150 dollars! Well if your interested
email me and i'll give you the details.
