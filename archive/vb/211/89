Subject: EveryBus 2003 T-Shirts Here!!!

Hi Everybody! I'm sure you all have your calendars marked for the     
rapidly approaching EveryBus festival. (www.everybus.com)             
Those of you who have attended in the past know that the t-shirts have
sold out within a couple hours. Don't be denied your shirt this year- 
pre-order now, and save the hassle of worrying about it once you get  
there.                                                                
This year's design, hand-selected by Chris himself, was done by Greg  
Potts, and can be viewed at this link:

The font will be slightly different, but other than that, the design  
will be pretty much as it appears. I'll post the final artwork on my  
site once I get it, but wanted to go ahead and start taking orders    
now, as there isn't much time with this year's EveryBus being a couple
weeks earlier than in the past. I am placing the final order in 2     
weeks, so I need your order in my hand before then.                   
Ordering information is on the t-shirt page of

If you have any questions, please e-mail me.                          
thanks!
