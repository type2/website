Subject: Re: [VB] Pressure Plate balance

Look closely at the dirt around the edges of the pressure plate and 
flywheel for any clues to the original position. If you cleaned the 
parts and washed away all the clues, then just put the pressure plate 
back on and forget it. Unless that's some amazingly low mileage engine 
you have, the pressure plate has probably already been replaced at least 
once before. And you're right about replacement PPs, you just bolt them 
on and hope for the best. This is why I don't think you should include 
the PP in the balancing of an engine. If the engine is not balanced 
independent of the PP, then you're screwed if you ever have to replace it.
