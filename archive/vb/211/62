All,

Ok I may have exaggerated a tad...may not like a sieve, but compared to the Castrol it was quite a bit, mostly from the main seal.  I have run HD30Wt Castrol with no probs.

Maybe some oil guru can enlighten us on the possibilites of seal shrinkage/deterioration with synth. vs. dino oil?

For now....I'll just keep on running the piss out of it. 

Beto
