Subject: One VWOA Elephant Ear Mirror Arm Needed....

Anybody have a spare arm in their spare parts pile they would like to part with!! Maybe we could work out a trade...

Looking to complete this project for the old '67 Westy before spring and we get back on the road.....

Thanks in advance for any help you can provide!
