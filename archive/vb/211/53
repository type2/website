Subject: [VB] Re: Castrol and BP

At the moment Mobil1 15-50, but no real advantage except emptying my wallet. 
  Next up is the HD30 Wal-Mart el cheapo brand to try it out.  If that is 
junk back to HD30 Pennzoil or Castrol.  No bat guano in my oil for additives 
either ;)

In my next motor (the T5 oxy-boxer) I will try out the diesel blends.  
Rotella from Shell 15-40 and/or the Mobil synthetic diesel blend which brand 
is escaping me at the moment...

As for tires.  The Kumho KH11s 205/65/R15 seem to be doing well on the 15x7 
Phones.

Beer.  That Michelob Ultra is pretty nice.  (since Miller is now owned by a 
South African company I have slowed my Miller Lite consumption drastically, 
which has helped out Johnny Walker and Anhieser-Busch a lot)

Ahhh that was fun,
Adrian Pillow

Disclaimer: I run Castrol GTX straight 30 weight in my Bus, along with
a semi-sekrit additive blend (cockatoo poop, among other things).  And
like the High Performance chapter in later editions of the Idiot manual
says, "Asking people what kind of oil they use is like asking what beer
they drink."

If anyone has anything to add, please speak up quick.  The "what tires
should I use" thread is scheduled next.  :)
