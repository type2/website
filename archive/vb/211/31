Subject: Re: [VB] "Slightly Custom"

While it's pushing it a tad, I still think this bus "looks" mildly 
custom. The roof is what pushes it for me. But the overall feel of 
the bus is mild custom in my opinion. Obviously people will disagree 
and I don't want to argue about it, but just wanted to chime in.

I think this is a fine looking bus and would easily be worth the 
money for someone looking for something like that. I do agree that 
making a custom bus for profit is harder to sell than a stock one. 
And many times don't fetch the same price. But I don't think this one 
is too far off for what it is. It's a nice bus. With very fine 
workmanship.

My opinion for the record.
