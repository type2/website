This isn't a phenom that's limited to VW's - you see the same thing
in the Kustom Rod scene, RiceBoyz, etc.  It's worse in the VW scene
because VW people (at least on this side of the pacific) are notoriously
cheap.

So, when you decide you have to have the bitchen slammed ride, with
(insert customization here), and (insert customization here), just
realize that potential buyers may not have the same tastes.  The closer
you remain to stock, the larger your potential buyer pool. have to have the 
bitchen (insert customization here) ride, with (insert customization here), 
and (insert customization here), just realize that potential buyers may not

potential buyer pool.  

FWIW, various things I've done to my buses can be considered custom
(walk-thru double cab, solid rear hatch, installing a sunroof in my '56) but 
they were stock in appearance.  Well, except for the bright yellow paint.

Yes, it's "your" bus, do what you want; just don't be surprised when 
people laugh and point when you put it on the auction block.
