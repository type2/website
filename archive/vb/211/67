Subject: Re: [VB] For the record: "new" king pin tolerance makes it

I sure would like to see where that specification is
printed. PLEASE show me in a factory book! I know that
is VALVE clearance. I would highly DOUBT that is any
kind of specified kingpin clearance other than a
smooth, nonbinding, no play fit in the bushing. If
they had that much clearance from NEW (rebuilt), what
would be the point? There would already be way too
much freplay. Any time I have looked for a spec on
this, it says something like "ream the bushings until
kingpin can be turned by hand (in the bushing) without
ANY obvious play being detected." That sure isn't
.006"/.15mm! Any time I have rebuilt them, I ream the
bushings until I can insert the kingpin in the bushing
SMOOTHLY, and NO PLAY. I cut the bushings .02mm at a
time until I can feel that the next cut will allow the
bushing to slide in, then I cut by .01mm. I have NEVER
seen the spec that says that .15mm/.006" gap. Again,
that would be WAY too much and would need to be
REPLACED if it were that much. Yes, it is dificult to
squeeze grease in when they are that new, but the
grease fills a slot in the bushing, and I would
presume it works its way up/down when turning. I
grease my front end ALOT, especially after a rebuild.
I have taken apart WAY too many spindles that were
WASTED due to no grease, especially the top bushing.
