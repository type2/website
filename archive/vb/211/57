Subject: Re: [VB] "Slightly Custom"

A local guy turned a 23 window into a double door panel with skylights but
no sunroof. as I understand it, not much was wrong with the 23 but it was
missing the corner glass and sunroof and he thought those parts where
unobtainable. cut the wheel wells and bolted up some baja spoke wheels, no
engine lid and a baja style stinger. He gave it a blue camo paint job too.
It read Air Cooled Unlimited on the side as he was a acvw mechanic with his
own shop.
