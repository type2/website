Subject: [VB] '67 brake fluid Reservoir ?

Hi I'm going to up grade the '63  Bus to a '67 brake master cylinder when
people are converting early buses over are you using the '67 reservoir or
something else ?  PS When I converted my '61 Beetle over I used the '67
Beetle reservoir( 1 year only,dual but old shape) is it the same with buses
?            Lloyd in Eureka,Calif
