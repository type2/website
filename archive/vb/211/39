Subject: Re: [VB] "Slightly Custom"

Whatever one may think of customized buses, it does look like a very
nicely done piece of work.

But the part I can't believe is putting over 2500 hours of labor into a
project, then "selling it so I can complete other projects".  What, 2500
hours of effort didn't make it personally valuable enough to keep?  This
was just a passing fancy until some bigger challenge came along?  Those
"other projects" must really be dillys!!
