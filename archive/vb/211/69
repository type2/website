Really, your cheapest and fastest tents are the ones on the market for plain
camping.  I just picked up a new tent (to replace another camping tent that
we wore out from use) from the camping store, 10 x 9 with a quick to set up
aluminum frame, heavy duty for $80.

I've got a couple of the drive away tents that are canvas and I hate setting
them up, they're heavy, time consuming and after 30 years, need some
repairs.

Unless you are going for that "vintage original" look, a new tent is
cheaper, faster and easier to use and not in need of repair.

My new tent will be the shower tent with my WONDERFUL Zodi hot water heater
and this year a large plastic box for the shower stall with a drain hose on
the bottom.  The tent, Zodi, wooden slat shower base and bucket for water
will all fit in the plastic shower box.

At one camping/show last summer, at least 30 people enjoyed the old shower
tent, but I didn't have the shower stall, just put the tent on a slope, but
the bottom of the tent really got wet, so this year's shower should be much
nicer.

Being a single dad with a 5 year old daughter, I like being able to have our
own shower, so I don't have to take her in the men's showers.  Not to
mention, the tent gives us more dry storage space.
