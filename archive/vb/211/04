You tell with the same method you use on splitties.  VW made subtle
changes from year to year to make those in the know look smart.

In this case, the front doors open with pushbuttons, so it's a '68.

Other changes that are tell-tales are the side markers or reflectors, the
wheels, the position of the front turn signals, the style of rear turn
signals, location of fuel filler, shape of air inlets, length of mirror,
etc.
