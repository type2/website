That bus is fairly priced when compared to some of the vehicles I have seen offered.Some of the Kustom hacks offered for big dough take a lot of time and resources to complete not just back to stock but to 
(re)finish the original mods.

Three or four owners ago that was an unfinished project just sitting.Jon bought it put a lot of quality work into it and the recognition and business it brings is likely worth the effort.It only takes one car to make you a star or a leper in the high end car market.Sometimes it only takes one car to do both,just ask Daryl(sp?) Adams in Ohio about this.He was the darling of the Concour and it all collapsed when it was exposed that the provenance of the vehicle was false.The owner of the vehicle made up a lot of the story behind that particular vehicle and it cost Adams and his employees their livelyhood.

This isn't a phenom that's limited to VW's - you see the same thing
in the Kustom Rod scene, RiceBoyz, etc.  It's worse in the VW scene
because VW people (at least on this side of the pacific) are notoriously
cheap.
