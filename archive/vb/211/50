Disclaimer: I run Castrol GTX straight 30 weight in my Bus, along with
a semi-sekrit additive blend (cockatoo poop, among other things). And
like the High Performance chapter in later editions of the Idiot manual
says, "Asking people what kind of oil they use is like asking what beer
they drink."

I prefer Guiness myself, but my Bus always has Kendal!

Light travels faster than sound. 
This is why some people appear bright until you hear them 
speak.
