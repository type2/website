Subject: Pressure Plate balance

I'm re-installing an original pressure plate and clutch disc out of a
'66 motor.  I remembered to mark the flywheel to crank orientation, but
stupidly forgot to mark the pressure plate to flywheel position.  

Since this is a factory original PP might there be a clue (read mark) to
how they (the factory) orientated the PP to the FW??  Have I made a
fatal mistake?  It must not be that big of a deal since when installing
a new PP there would be no balance mark....or would there?  

How should I go about re-installing the PP to the FW with regards to
keeping it close to balanced?
