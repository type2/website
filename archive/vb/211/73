Subject: look what I found

Was traveling on business in west texas. Followed up on an old lead 
and found this:
http://www.type2guy.com/temp/61dd/

bulkhead and wheel wells are hacked. But this thing is DRY!! No rust 
man. Solid as a rock. I'm doing my best to work a deal for it. The 
guy knows it's cool. I found a couple other DD panels a while back, 
but they will take a lot of work to get on the road. This one could 
be on the road REAL quick. And since I'm a much better welder now, 
fixing that sheetmetal would be a no big deal. The nose is great. 
Rockers are solid. Really great bus. Hope I can find a way to get it!
