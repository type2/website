Subject: RE: [VB] Opinions needed on tire choice!

Back in the eighties I got a pair of wheel adapters and used them for awhile.
Then in the mid nineties I discovered that nearly all of the tire shops didn't
have the adapter for the wide five. I decided that if I balanced my adapter on
the bubble then I could throw it in the treasure chest with some short bolts
and nuts to use on the shops balancer. Works great.

That's what I figure. He can't balance them though - doesn't have the
thingee to do it. Nor does he have the on-the-car balancer either.


How stable are they at highway speed in wet weather?  This is critical for
me.

Thanks!
