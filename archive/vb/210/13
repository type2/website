yes there is a left and a right.   Hold up to your bus to tell which it is.  
Great score!!!!

I got a pair of NOS seals for my safaris not long after I got the bus with 
safaris.   they fit great.  I recommend thouroughly glycerining them before 
use, to keep them supple. For teh first while they only oozed a drip in 
really heavy rains.     Even after 5 years, my seals are not too bad, except 
I do pull teh drivers side safaris for winter driving.    then you might park 
with the latches undone to ease squash against the seals.
