Don,
Are we talking about the bolt or the threaded insert in the case?

If it's the bolt, you should be able to get it in there....I've done it a few 
times. It's tight...be should be doable.

If we're talking about the insert....and you work alone..best to wait until 
you drop that motor again.  Putting that insert in is a bitch esp. if it's a 
doghouse shroud.  I know a few guys that say it can be done, but I've never 
been successful.
