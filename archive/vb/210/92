Earlier.  '71s had disk brakes and rectangular reflectors in the front
doors and rectangular marker lights in the rear quarter panels.  this bus
has round reflectors on both ends and pushbutton front doors.  It's a 68.

Despite the poor regard that bay window buses have on the VB list, this
looks like a nice bus.  Body looks rather straight.  It'll make a nice
driver, and if it's complete $500 is a great deal.  Subscribe to the Bay
list and be happy!  Stick around here, though, as your engine has more
in common with the splitty crowd.
