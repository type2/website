Subject: Re: sunroofs and leakage

I had a '64 Deluxe in Seattle for 4 years,
never leaked. It can be done, but it may not
be easy. Mine just worked, never had to mess with it.

Jeff - busless but wishing he still had that '64

im wanting to put in a canvas slide back sunroof 
in my 58' bus, but im worried about it leaking.
does anyone have a problem with there roof leaking 
with a slide sunroof?? my bus is my daily driver and
its going to leak after I install safaris, but I don't 
want any more than that!
