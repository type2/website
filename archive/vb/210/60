Subject: How much pressure to grease king pin zerks?

Hi,

It is super-easy to grease the link pin zerks. But I cannot get enough 
pressure on the gun to grease the king pin zerks. And I bet I'm putting 
a fair amount of pressure in there (and I have a large sized grease 
gun.)

I'm guessing that's because the seals are doing their job, and there is 
no way for the grease to escape. But I wanted to make sure this was the 
case. Maybe I should pull out the zerks and see if I can get grease 
through them? They are new, but you never know I guess.

Long story...

I got my re-sealed spindles back and began to put them on today. Bus 
Boys sent a note back saying that they had assembled one of the 
spindles dry. (Or at least I think that's what the note said. But they 
could have meant that they assemble them dry, which wouldn't make much 
sense.)

If you remember, I sent the spindles back due to king pin bush seal 
cracking and one of the spindles was very difficult to move. If the 
spindle was assembled dry, that might explain why the passenger side 
was so hard to move. (I guess I'll find out when I start working on 
that side.)

BTW,  I ordered link pin dust seals from Wolfgang International. Their 
ship time is awesome. However, their link pin dust seals are horrible - 
they are too thin, and cupped in the shape of a "u". They fit so poorly 
that they would not provide any kind of seal at all. I hope this is not 
indicative of the parts we have available now. I went ahead and used 
the cracked seals I had (the new ones from Bus Boys that had cracked). 
I'll probably replace them later this year.

By this time, I have assembled each side three times. Each time I get a 
little bit better. Nothing like practice.

Conrad
