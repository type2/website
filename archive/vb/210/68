Subject: June VW Shows

Hi,

Our local club is trying to nail down a date for our show that will minimize
conflict with other shows.  If anyone knows of anything (anywhere in the USA)
scheduled in June, and you could drop me a quick note with the date &
location, I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks,
Matt Montgomery
