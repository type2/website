Subject: drag link replacement

Well, last week I replaced the link pin and bushing. It went pretty 
smoothly. I was able to use the rental reamer and in about a half of a 
day, it is back together again and well greased.

Now, I'm trying to replace the drag link. I took the nuts off both ends. 
I found that both cotter pins were missing. The nuts were still tight 
and came off without any trouble. Then came the lost battle. A friend 
lent me his pickle fork and sledge hammer to use to drive the tie rod 
ends out. After hard hammering for about a half hour, I felt like I 
needed to ask the gurus for a consultation. If hammering is what needs 
to happen, then hammering will happen again. Does it need to be heated? 
I read a few days ago that some other parts may need to be disassembled 
 to get the drag link out. Is this the case? Advice needed to find the 
way through this challenge. Thanks in advance for guidance.

Dave
