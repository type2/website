Here are some hopefully helpful tips that I have used.  Since the clutch
cable arm is in the way, you must get behind it, but the area is tight for
a big combo wrench turn.

Easy and cheap method; Take a 15 mm or 17 mm combo wrench (whichever yours
uses as a top bolt) and using a cut-off wheel, cut it in half.  Use the
newly made stubby boxed end wrench to tighten the bolt.

More expensive method; go to Sears and buy the (15 mm, 17 mm) ratcheting
wrenchs and use them.

Best,
