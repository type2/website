Subject: RE: [VB] Auto-craft ratio rockers

There are too many assumptions here. Are you using a ratio rocker set for a
factory cam or a high lift cam ? Is this a "bolt on" set or do you require
something else. I'm assuming that the engine is a stock 1600DP with a CB
performance or someone else's Dual 34 kit. Need more info to answer, but in
all reality, I'd split the case and do the geometry on the new lifters before
deciding to use them with what you got. I've seen problems with bolt on 1.25:1
ratios on a standard cam.

Subject: [VB] Auto-craft ratio rockers


Hello all

Well, I am about to pull the engine and while it is out, I was thinking of
what I might do to take advantage of the situation.  I received a pair of
auto-craft ratio rockers, with push rods, from the fellow I bought the bus
from.  The engine is a 1600DP with dual solex pict 34 carbs, about 4500 miles
on the engine.

My questions are:

#1- should I change over to the autocraft rockers, or leave it alone.  What
advantages/disadvantages will I see???

#2 Do I need to do anything special to put the rockers on, or can I just pull
the old ones, swap the push rods and install the autocraft, and reset the
valves.

Thanks again for all the advice, it is much appreciated.
