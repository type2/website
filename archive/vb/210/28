Hi Matt,
Generators do not need the idiot light to work, but from what we have heard
alternators do need them!

>>Take the other two ends of the battery cables off their connections and
shine them up. <<

The OG cables had the clamps cast onto the cable.  If we use replacement
cable clamps we buy brass ones and solder them to the cables for a couple of
less connections to cause voltage drop!  Before doing any cleaning especially
before wire brushing put the cable clamps and ends of the cables on a tin can
filled 2/3s full of water with two tablespoons of baking soda stirred in.
The baking soda will nuetralize the sulfuric acid and then when cleaning the
clamps you will be exposed to it alot less and not flick acid in your eyes!
Plus with the acid nuetralized on the clamps the corrosion will be slowed way
down from forming again.  We remove/inspect/clean connections on our
batteries each spring and fall to prevent low voltage and dead battery
problems.
