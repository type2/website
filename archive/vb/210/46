Subject: 12V Clocks?

Anyone here repair the 12V VDO Clocks, or know someone who does?  I picked one
up in a package deal yesterday and it doesn't work.  I've taken it apart and
applied power, and grounded it.  When the points touch it works for half a
second, at least the gears turn, but nothing after that.  A friend suggested
gutting it and putting a quartz movement in it.  I really would have it
working original, even if nothing else on the Bus is original. I may do the 6V
one like that, it's pretty rough.
