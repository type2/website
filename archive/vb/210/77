Subject: Can you tell from the pics?

Hey there.

Im trying to identify this bus.  I just bought it, more or less sight
unseen.  All i have are these pics.

From the best I can tell, it's a '67 (the yard boss thinks).  I think
its a westy from pic 2 and pic 3.  you can see the short pop up
housing and the roof rack.  he also thinks it runs, but he does have
all of the 5 lug wheels and the engine appears to be complete.

i paid $500.  did i get robbed?

Dave.
