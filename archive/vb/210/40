Hi Jason,
We do not know of the manufacture of that rack, but it was sold through all 
VOA dealers starting about 1968 and later.  It came with a shiney metalic 
blue with silver lettering sticker on the front center railing.
Not near as strong as the German made ones sold though VW worldwide in the 
1950-60s.
