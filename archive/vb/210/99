Subject: Re: [VB] June VW Shows

Check out this page of VW show information for the East Coast: 
http://www.gti16v.org/shoinfo.htm#shoindex.  The shows in Mohnton, PA on
June 8 and Litchfield CT on June 15 are both excellent and very well
attended.

The webpage also has links to other pages of VW show information.
