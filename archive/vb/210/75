Subject: re:upper engine bolt

great to see you are almost there...both top bolts are a royal pita...my
engine has an insert on the driver side top. there have been a lot of
suggestions to me on ways to modify this to make it easier...if you check
the archives you might find them.

i actually take a steel hook(the type used to hang a paint bucket off a
ladder)hook it on the clutch arm, and pull towards the front...this usually
give me enough room to get the bolt in. granted my arms feel bent out of
shape thinking about the odd position this puts you body in, but it is
doable...
