I play it safe, and leave a bouncy 1/2 inch of loose play at the pedal -
no more broken cables, they fall apart from age now. My last one went 12
years. The 1/2 inch that I leave seems to be just the taking up of cable
slack, then the rear spring really kicks in another inch down, then the
TO/clutch kicks in a short distance further. Leaves me tons of pedal room
for the clutch.

The first half-inch is spring-driven though, so it isn't loose-loose. It's
just light and easily finger-pushable.
