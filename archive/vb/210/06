That day will probably come but I'm not sure how close it is.
Consider that VW was probably the last automaker to convert to
12 V, by 1968.  It's now 35 years later and we can still get
the bulbs.  The last time I looked, I couldn't get the sealed
beams at Wal-Mart, but I could still buy the 1154 6 V tail-light
bulbs!  Wagner had the 6006 in their 1994 catalog, and GE has
it in their online catalog today.

One thing you could try is to write to your favorite bulb vendor
(GE, Wagner, and Philips are probably the big names in automotive
bulbs) and ask them what the outlook is for 6 V bulbs.  They may
not be as forthcoming with an answer for this "consumer" product,
but in the electronics industry, it is very common for companies
to announce that "we are going to quit making part no. 1234 in
2 years, so figure out how many you need to support what you've
got in the field now and buy them now."

As a data point, Wagner rates their 6006 sealed-beam at 75 hours
on the high beam and 150 hours on the low beam.  GE rates theirs
at 300 hours high and 500 hours low.  At an average speed of 30
mph, that's between 4500 and 1500 miles of driving with the low
beams on.  Your mileage may vary.
