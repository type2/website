Subject: RE: [VB] roof rack question

I just pick one up just like that off eb(-at-)y for 71.00!!! i wasnt the high
bidder  but i contacted the seller a few day after the end and he said the
high bidder didnt want to pay the high $ shipping cost . so i told him i
would come pick it up as he was only 1 1/2 hrs from me. this is the 2nd time
I have done this the first was with my 65 bus for 160.00 same kinda thing
the high bidder didnt come through so I got the bus after contacting the
seller. so now I finally have a roof rack it needs a little help 2 of the
legs are loose from the frame and will need to be rewelded and a new paint
job, but its rust free. good luck Jason it took me about a yr 1/2 to find
one that I could afford. now if I can just find that side step for 15 bucks
Ill be set:)
later
Ian in norfolk
74 hardtop camper
72 bus
65 standard
6?FG buggy
