Subject: Re: [VB] Can you tell from the pics?

A couple of thoughts, from the pics, the body does not look bad.

#1 It seems resonably straight, with no obvious major rust. From what we can
see, the interior does not have alot of water staining or damage, so that is
another small clue as far as potential rust damage goes.   The one thing
that will stop most buses, or really any clasic car, from being worth
anything is major rust.  Engines are easy to find, or fix, and it is a
bolt-up operation that most anyone can do,or learn. Repairing rusty body
work has a long learning curve. It is more of an art to do it right. And
paying someone to do it will cost a fortune. Always look for a good, sound
body and undercarriage.

#2  As someone else mentioned, this list is for the older, 1967 and earlier
buses. If that is what you want, you have come to the right place.  If you
want a later bus, there is a list for them, but I can not tell you where it
is.  In either case, next time before buying something sight unseen, get on
the appropriate list and ask for help.  For example, I am in California, and
saw a listing for an old Jaguar in Rhode Island.  I asked my Jaguar list
members if anyone was close to the car, and would they mind going to check
it out for me.  I had a couple of volunteers, and afterwards I was able to
purchase the car, really understanding what I was buying.  The internet, and
the discussion groups, are a wonderful resource. You don't need to do this
alone.

Good luck
