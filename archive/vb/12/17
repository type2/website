Hey All,
    First off, to all you lifeless wonders acussing me of ruining vintage
busses,take a hike.I didn't paint them this way,Discover card did.I will
most likely return them to there original Vw. colors.(If I can afford it).As
far as J. G. once owning one,I was told that by the priest who sold them to
me and who am I to not believe a man of the cloth.I thought is was untrue,
and hence my question to the list.
    To all others with the helpful comments,a sincere THANK YOU.Especially
to Dan K. for giving me the lowdown on the 66 deluxe !!
    I am bringing these two buses home tonight and I wonder how my neighbors
will fell about them parked outside of my suburban house !? I will probably
be burned in effigy.

                             woody

ps. To the people who pmailed me discouraging remarks and don't even know
me,in my life I have brought back many a splittie from the crusher and help
put them back on the road !!! Get a F' in clue.
