http://www.outwater.com  click on the "Furniture 
Components" the moldings will be under "Extrusions".
  They carry all kinds of neat stuff, their site is 
worth exploring. Also check out the "Architectural 
Products" if you want to give your Westy interior a 
Greek or Roman theme.

Does anyone know where one can purchase the plastic "T"

edge of the plywood cabinets in a Westy?  I am also in 
need of the trim that
trims out the edge of the cabinets where they meet the

like a "bulb" type weather stripping).
