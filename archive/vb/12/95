Subject: Re: [VB] Emblem Clips?

On the subject......... I went to ACE Hardware the other day to pick-up some
bolts and nuts for my 65 and discovered that they stock clips that almost
exactly resemble the original clips I took off my Bus. You'd have to bring
your emblem with though since they have like four different sizes of these.
Cheap, $0.39 each.
