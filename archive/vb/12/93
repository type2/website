Ellis,

This is one of the funniest things I've seen on this list in a long
time.  While they aren't all bus realted, I've enjoyed them alot.  I'm
not competing, just sitting back enjoying, looking forward to
Familienfest tomorrow.  See you all there.

Good idea, Made me laugh.
Single Wheel dot Com Rules.
I love single wheel trailers.

Take care,
Aaron
