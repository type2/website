Subject: repro pop-outs help...

I have a set of repro pop-out frames I got from BFY(I think) and they
don't seem to fit all that well. I got the glass and rubber into them
without too much trouble, but they don't seem to fit the bus well. They
are too close to the edge where the latch is and too far from the edge
where the hinge is. When I install the latch and close it, it pulls the
window in so tight it pulls the rubber out of the channel on the window
from scraping the door edge. When I got the DC it had no pop-outs
installed so I don't have old ones to reference. Anyone have any
experience with these repro frames? Any tips on installing them? I am
hoping that Im just doing something wrong, but it seems pretty self
explanatory to install these into the bus so I'm starting to thing I
have junk-ola frames. Any help is appreciated!!!
TJ
