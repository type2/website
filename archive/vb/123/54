I can't get it to run steadily, at all, much less
idle.

tried to rebuild the old 34 PICT, that didn't seem to
work, and the throttle pump was screwed up.  Bought a
new one (Mexican 34PICT) and the thing came the
closest to firing up.

When I was putting it all together, I used Muir's
methods to tell if it was TDC, so I think that's OK,
I'm pretty much over that route now.

I've tried screwing with the idle mix screw, which
seemed to help a little, and a little less with the
idle speed screw.  The problem is, if it won't run or
idle, I can't adjust it until it starts to die, as it
dies on its own!  Is there some magical position in
which these are fairly universal?  Bentley's says to
turn the idle mix all the way in, then 2.5-3 full
turns out.  Is there a formula like this for the idle
speed?

Right.  In my case (pun intended) the case and dist.
are listed as having the same timing - 5 ATDC.

thanks
