Subject: Bug-O-Rama and a Puck........

Bug-O-Rama was good for selling, but as far as anything really
worthwhile parts wise to buy there wasn't much. There were a couple good
deals on Buses, and there was a Euro '55 Bug (basket case) that was down
to $2000 towards the end of the day Sunday, as well as quite a few
single wheel and camping trailers for sell.

My big purchase was a '68 Puck. I'm going to use it behind my DD EZ. We
towed a '64 Nimrod tent trailer out with us, so I didn't get to bring it
home, but I'm going back tomorrow to pick it up. It's a little rough
around the edges, and needs a new po top tent, but overall is in great
shape. It even has the side tent with it! My question to the many other
Puck owners on the list is where can I find a replacement pop top tent?

As far as a trip report, the trip was pretty uneventful. The new motor
(1641cc dual Dellorto 40's) in the DD cruised nice, and pulled the
trailer with no problem. We had a caravan of 9 Buses and the only
casualty was an *almost* lost Single wheel trailer, and a clutch disc
that started slipping about 45 minutes away from home, probably caused
by the full load in the Bus, and the 900 mile an hour head winds as we
were leaving Sacramento on 80.

I talked with a few listees, and was quite a few more..............
