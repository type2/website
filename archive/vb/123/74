Subject: Re: [VB] Any tricks to get off a stuck front wheel bearing?

Inner bearing (the bigger one) or outer bearing?  If it's the inner
bearing, this is a good job for a Dremel.  I had that problem with a 74
Beetle recently--bearing assy. had disintegrated leaving the inner
bearing race cemented to the spindle.  I pulled out the Dremel (I made
sure to ask the kids to get me one last Xmas) and grinding stone bit. 
Carefully ground down a spot on the inner bearing race until I had a
safe place to whack it sideways with a cold chisel until it cracked open
and popped off.
