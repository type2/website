Check out www.movecars.com, the Internet directory of auto shippers. 
Some of them will do online quotes.  If you want real security (and
higher prices to go with it), you could opt for covered shipping.  If
you go uncovered, be prepared to spend a lot of time degreasing the
diesel soot from your paint job when the bus arrives.

Based on personal experience, my guess would be around $700-$800 for
uncovered shipping.
