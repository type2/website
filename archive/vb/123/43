ya, and while you have the rear wheels off the ground, or even have the 
wheels off, try he rear drums for wiggle.   they should not wiggle or thunk- 
if you do you should look at new reduction bearings.  think there should only 
be a hair of wiggle- a thunk thunk is bad.  But keeping enough clean oil in 
there makes them last a long time.

 you do this to heat up the gear oil and make it drain quicker -
 it's pretty thick.  Jack up the back end of the Bus, take the rear
 wheels off, and put it on jack stands - try to have it at norma....snip >>
