Hi everyone,

A little over seven months ago, a good friend and local St. Louis area VW=
 enthusiast died at a young age.  Obviously the family and all of his VW =
friends were stunned and are still grieving.  We'll miss our buddy Kurt a=
t all our meetings, campouts and shows.  He was a lot of fun to be around=
, would help anyone out, loved VW's and he'll be missed for a long, long =
time to come.

His brother is now ready to sell off some of Kurt's VW collection and ask=
ed some of us to help by looking at the vehicles and composing and ad and=
 passing it around.  The family hopes that Kurt's cars will find good hom=
es in the hands of other VW enthusiasts.  I'm sure that Kurt would like t=
hat too.  I helped recently by traveling to the place where the following=
 four VW's were being stored.  During our brief visit, these are the best=
 descriptions we could come up with.  All vehicles have clear Missouri ti=
tles.  For more details, please contact Paul Smith by phone at (636) 225-=
4361.  These VW's will probably be sold below their value, some well belo=
w their value, but you'll need to discuss those matters with Paul, not me=
!  If you're looking around for a new VW project, one of these might just=
 fit the bill at an affordable price...

1956 "Cal-looker" Sunroof Beetle.  Built about 12-15 years ago, metalflak=
e candy-apple red paint, mileage unknown but fairly low.  It is also stor=
ed and covered in the semi-trailer.  I couldn't get to it to check it out=
, but the following review is from another friend who knows the car.  Bri=
an says: "Very nice, somewhat quirky (with electrical system).  It has a =
1904cc stroker motor, with 90.5mm pistons.  Dual Webers (2 bbls).  The tr=
ans is a stock '67 4 speed, I think.  Brakes are stock drums, but may be =
off of a later swingaxle car as well.  The sunroof was professionally add=
ed to this Oval window, and I believe it was the medium length from a '57=
, an excellent fit.  The car has an adjustable front beam, custom interio=
r, a stereo system (but is probably pretty outdated by now).  Scat style =
shifter, chrome wheels, etc.  12v alternator, too, I think.  S&S Headers,=
 doghouse oil cooler, probably more, but I cannot remember.  I have drive=
n the car, and it ran and drove fine...and was really fast!!!  It is not =
a stock car, and probably never will be.  It may not even be on a '56 pan=
, but an early sixties unit."  Thanks Brian!  This car and the Bus will s=
oon be removed from the semi-trailer, so we'll know more details then.  L=
ocated near St. Louis, Missouri.  =20


Could someone possibly "forward" this post over to the Vanagon e-mail Lis=
t, or perhaps guide me to their address so I could pass this on for the S=
mith family?  Thanks!
