Any of you SoCal, Hollywood insider type bus folks have the scoop as to =
if the "Mystery Machine" in the new Scooby Doo movie is a VW or not?  =
You can only see a partial shot of the cargo door in the commercial.  =
Looks like it might be.  I'll have to take my boys to go see iteither =
way but if there is a VW in it at least I would have something to look =
forward too.
