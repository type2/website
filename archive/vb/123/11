I went to start my baby (59 panel) and as I pushed the clutch pedal down, it 
went to the bottom and stopped.  So hop out and pull the pedal back up, it 
stays, so I push it down again and it sticks at the floor.  So what happened? 
 I don't beleive its a clutch cable, cause I remember that when  they go you 
can move the pedal up and down freely, no resistance.  I have to pull the 
motor to replace the clutch and pressure plate so I was prepared , so its now 
a matter of it having been driven to the shop versus now being towed  in 
Germany its a big ouch..  So everyone let me know what I'll need from start 
to finish to politically correct refresh my clutch set up from front to the 
back of the bus, ie clutch cable, pressure plate, etc...Thanks for the help 
in advance..
