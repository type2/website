Subject: How to test engine??

Allright Y'all, I have a 1600 DP engine I want to test. I also have a 66 Kombi with starter present but all other electrical is really screwy (or screwed up, I don't know yet.) Anyway, I put the engine in the 66 to test it but can't seem to figure out how I can start it up. There is no key, no ignition switch, and the wiring up front in the cab is a spagetti twisted mess. The engine has an alternator conversion with built in regulator. Is there a way I can wire the battery directly to the starter or alternator just to get the engine started to see if it runs?



Peace, John Baker
