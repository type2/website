Subject: retractable seatbelt installation webpage

Well, I wrote up a little spiel abouth the Vanagon retractable seatbelts I
installed in the 70 this week...
http://www.ckoon.org/vw/beltpic/seatbelts.html

The instructions should apply to any Baywindow, and to MOST Splitties, with
some tweaking. Especially in busses currently with NO belts :)

Any comments, suggestions or improvements, holler.
