Subject: Oil Control Piston Removal? - was: new engine blows two oil coole

>I'll bet you have to struggle to pull the piston. <

Is there a tool or good trick to getting stuck oil control pistons out? 

I have a case sitting in my basement shop that is pretty good except for the
oil piston not wanting to come out.  This case had been sitting a long time
and had some water in the bottom so it is probably corroded in there pretty
good.  

Normally a wand magnet is all that I need to take them out.   


Thanks,
