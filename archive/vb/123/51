Hi All-

Went out and had a look. By bowden tube I assume evreyone is referring to
the rubber tube that is attached to the end of the metal clutch line?

Aside from the fact that there is very little  space in which to get at this
tube (tranny and all in the way)- how should I remove this? From the back
(where the wing nut is) or at the other end? I don't want to make the
problem any wosre so ask questions before I do anything :)

Thanks again

M.
