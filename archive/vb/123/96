You're gonna have to get in there above the starter. There is a bolt that
goes through the starter and serves as an engine bolt too. Best way is to
have someone hold the bolt from the starter side and tighten the nut from
inside the engine bay behind the fanshroud. One thing that makes the job
easier is to weld a small bolt or something to the head of the starter/
engine bolt. This will keep the bolt from spinning while you install the nut
(it's hard enough to get your hand in there let alone a wrench!).
