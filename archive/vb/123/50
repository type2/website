Hi All-

I am *trying* to replace the cluctch cable on my 65 bus unfrotunately am =
using Brazillian clutch cable (hoping the cherman VW fairies will =
forgive this error in judgement)

To the point- how do I get htis blasted thing through the tube. I am =
inserting the cable from front of bus towards the back. It is 90% in the =
tube but in feels like it is hitting something at the end. I assume this =
has to do with the fact that the cable has to travel 30% upwards for the =
final foot or so. I have put in tonnes of grease and even resorted to =
squirting WD40 from the back forward. No dice :P

So I am hoping someone out there has some great suggestion that will =
stop the cable from bunching up or hitting whatever it is.

THanks!

Michael
