I replaced a broken crossover shaft today (Thanks Viking Import!) and
have a few comments, questions.

 

1.	How in the (-at-)#$(-at-)#^$* do I get the new clutch spring back on?? Is
there a best way? 
2.	What are the little rubber pieces in the crossover shaft rebuild
kit? Are they important?
3.	What size dowel do I need to buy to make a pressure plate
alignment tool?  (I took the pressure plate off to check for damage.
Oops)

 

 

Thanks from Charlotte,
