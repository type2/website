OK, It's almost in. When I pulled it, my last mechanic only put in 3 of
the 4 bolts. He left out the one above the clutch. Now I have the motor
back in place, the two lower studs with nuts on them. How do you get to
the bolt above the starter? All I feel from the top is a hole, and can't
get to above the starter from down below. 

 

Thanks 

Raymond in Charlotte
