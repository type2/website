I think it is a Dodge or Ford.  I saw one of them (most likely a promo car)
at a interiror shop getting some work done. The paint was done up with the
"mystery machine" on the side.  I assume they'll drive to the premier in it
or something like that.

Any of you SoCal, Hollywood insider type bus folks have the scoop as to if
the "Mystery Machine" in the new Scooby Doo movie is a VW or not?  You can
only see a partial shot of the cargo door in the commercial.  Looks like it
might be.  I'll have to take my boys to go see iteither way but if there is
a VW in it at least I would have something to look forward too.
