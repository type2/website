Hello, folks.  Your receiving this for one of two
reasons:  either (1) you are on Frank's group
mailing and I'd like you to consider joining us
on the list for the Ohio Valley Tribe of the Full
Moon Bus Club or (2) you are subscribed to Ohio
Valley Tribe and I'd like you to read Frank's
announcement regarding the gathering Columbus
that Admiral Frank is planning.  

Either way, I hope to see you in August!
