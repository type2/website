  To me it looks more like an early vanagon. I did see
one episode where they had to have the rear end
repaired. They showed the engine in the back but it
had 2 doors that opened out on the back instead of a
hatch. I assumed that they were attempting to mimic a
VW but, I could be wrong. I am quite often. I like to
think of it as a VW. I gives me an excuse to watch the
cartoon. :0)
