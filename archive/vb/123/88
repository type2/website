Possible, but the thickness of the material comes into question.  The
steel is a good (not great) conductor, but the plate is quite thin.  The
alloy case is a better conductor, but thicker.  the sump is also finned,
so I would expect it to be at a lower temperature than the sump plate,
since it can get rid of heat faster.

All in all, the metal of the case should be at pretty much the same
temperature as the oil inside.  It might be a couple of degrees cooler on
the exterior surface, but it should follow the oil temperature pretty
closely, as the oil supplies heat in endless quantities.

I don't think that the material of the sump plate is the cause of the
differing temps.  I think that the oil between the solid bottom of the oil
screen and the sump plate remains relatively stagnent and therefore
supplies some insulation between the fast-moving hot oil at the pickup
tube and the plate

My preliminary work seems to indicate that the dipstick is at one of the
hotter regions of the sump.
