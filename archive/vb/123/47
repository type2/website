Subject: new truck!

well, I went and did it....

bought this really cr%ppy 63 SC, last registered 1990. unfortunately the 
wheel wells aren't cut, so I can't put the fat tires on it.  Cause I couldn't 
cut them myslef.  it does have  rust. in strange places.    When I took the 
engine off the front seat and put it in the bed I knocked a hole in the 
truck.   2/3 seat is broken where it fits the holder on the left side.  
Drivers door handle mechanisms is messed up on the inside- where the handle 
slides on.  was real hard to push into The shed as the DPO must have left the 
parking I have a real nice 67 drivers door to trade (or other stuff).  Title 
went through, so that's okay.  They had to do a microfische search as it had 
dropped out of the computer!   It's crusty green, but pretty straight.  Even 
the gates are straight!   (except the tailgate, which came off a yellow 
truck.)  And has a front emblem, three engine/treasure chest door holder 
uppers,  and 4 (four) bumpers (three in the bed, plus an extra bowed side 
gate with all three hinges broken off)  Think I'll paint it dark purple with 
black rims and make it a beater hauler.  nice interior roof panels.  I'm 
pretty happy with Ugly Truck.   FOr some strange reason it has one late style 
front axle nut cover cap with the easy off lip, and one early style one with 
no lip.  36mm Rear nuts both sides, but dunno whats underneath.  wonder if 
its the 63 little big nut gearing.    Okay, take pity on me, I certainly 
don't deserve congratulations for this. 

now to decide, shall it be 6V or 12V?

what size motor?

what size brakes and RGearing?

might go with the 6V 40hp 1.39 deal.  ya.  28pict solex. gimme 30mpg. throw a 
15gallon tank in it and fill up once every 450 miles.
