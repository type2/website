Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch pedal, what happened?

first I would feel back by the clutch cable wingnut and make sur ethe cable 
hasn't snapped, but I would also suspect that your pivot joint is crusty.   
Sounds like the bus doesnot get driven much, and is resentful of that.   
Solution- take it apart and regrease it.   the pivot that swings under the 
clutch pedal, that is.  And drive the bus more.   Grease is good, your bus 
loves grease.

 I went to start my baby (59 panel) and as I pushed the clutch pedal down, it 
 went to the bottom and stopped.  So hop out and pull the pedal back up, it 
 stays, so I push it down again and it sticks at the floor.  So what 
happened? 
  I don't beleive its a clutch cable, cause I remember that when  they go you 
 can move the pedal up and down freely, no resistance.  I have to pull the 
 motor to replace the clutch and pressure plate so I was prepared , so its 
now 
 a matter of it having been driven to the shop versus now being towed  in 
 Germany its a big ouch..  So everyone let me know what I'll need from start 
 to finish to politically correct refresh my clutch set up from front to the 
 back of the bus, ie clutch cable, pressure plate, etc...Thanks for the help 
 in advance..
