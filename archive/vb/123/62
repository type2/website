Subject: wrong crank pulley/timing???

Howdy, 

thanks to everyone who has tried to help.  Still no
favorable outcome.  Could the wrong points have
anything to do here?  I just went back through my
receipts and noticed that the points I have were for
my old dist., and the dist. I'm using now has
different ones (Bosch # 02 054 old dist., 02 074 new
dist.).  This probably can't help the situation any...
