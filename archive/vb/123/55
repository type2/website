Subject: NW Vintage Meet July 20th

Vintage Meet this year is Saturday July 20th at the Shoreline Community 
College (same place as last year).  It's exit 175 off I-5, then there'll be 
signs to the site.  A bug will be raffled off.   The Burger Meet is at the 
University Burgermaster the evening before  (19th) for chit chat, food, and 
gawking at all the cool VWs.  Sunday there's some sort of shindig at Bowwow.  
  SIR will probably be the Sunday as well - for those who like drag racing 
bugs and a big swap area.  

For more info:

So mark it on your calender and head to Seattle in July!
