Subject: Any tricks to get off a stuck front wheel bearing?

1964 old style (two nuts) front wheel bearing is really attached to the
spindle.
I have banged, heated, squirted and pried.
So now I have a f***'d bearing stuck in the drum and it won't come off the
spindle.
Anyone have a solution to the problem, the other side came apart like
supposed to, so much for the 1 hour job regreasing the front bearings.

ps. I have finally made it to my first 100 miles in a split bus
