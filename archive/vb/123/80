Subject: RE: [VB] Clutch pedal, what happened?

Check your return spring. I got a brandy new trans (well, rebuilt) they
recased it, and they left the old clutch throwout stuff. The spring died
(right away) , and pedal acted the same. Use your hand, if the pedal
goes down pretty easy, feeling normal, but stays down, I bet this is the
trouble. Might as well change cable, grease it real well, grease all the
pivot points, and change spring. Hopefully just grease and new cable
works, or the motors coming out to redo the clutch throwout shaft
spring, bushings..
