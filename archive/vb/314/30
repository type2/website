Subject: It's alive! And rear wheel seals are leaking...

First of all, I ran my new motor for the first time tonight!  It's the first time my bus has run in over a year and a half.  What a good feeling that was!  It started right up, I idled through the 20 minute break in.  Tomorrow I will double check valves and timing and run some more.
 
The bad news is that I finished my RGB assembly last weekend.  When I filled them up, oil started leaking through the overflow hole on the bottom as well as around the axle stubs.  Both sides are acting the same, so I must have missed something.  They are new seal kits, what did I do wrong? 
 
I'm trying to get this resolved by the weekend so I can reassemble the brakes and start moving.
 
Thanks in advance,
Matt
