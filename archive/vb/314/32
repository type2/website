I'd be checking the throw out bearing. Sounds wrong to me. Had all sorts
of clutch problems when working with dune buggies and sand rails. Seems
like they throw in almost any kind of combination and expect it to work!

Hi  I've having problems with a Kennedy 1700 lb pressure plate,
engaging/disingaging the clutch in the '63 Bus.

only thing different is the clutch arm on the trans is the later off set
type.I'm still using the pressure plate with the ring, early throwout
bearing... It feels like the arm movement is not enough.
