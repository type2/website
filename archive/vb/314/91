Subject: Turn indicator

I recently installed a wireworks harness in my bus, everything works fine 
but the indicator light for the turn signal stays on, dim at all times.  
Gets brighter when I use the signals, but wont go off and stays on when the 
igniton is off.  I have a two prong flasher relay.  Doesent matter what side 
the indicator light wire is attached to.

Could it be a.  the flasher relay is bad or wrong
or b. the turnsignal switch is bad?  Or possibly c. somthing I haven't 
thought of?
