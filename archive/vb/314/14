AL,

I'd only use the first circuit - you don't want the pooped battery being
connected to the starting battery as soon as the ign switch is trying to
start the car (what the second circuit is doing). I'd connect some series
diodes with the relay coil in the first circuit, to raise the relay's
operating threshold to at least 12 volts, so that it isn't connected to
the starter battery until the genny/alt is producing at least 12 volts,
meaning the engine is definitely running, not just turning fast during
start.
