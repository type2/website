Subject: cases and head for sale

Hello all. I cleaned out my garage the other day and found some old cases I have had for a while. I have one set of 1584cc(1600cc) cases(from71-74) and two sets of 1192cc(1200cc)  cases(from60-65). All three sets are in good condition. I also have a single 1300cc/1600cc head that is new. I need to sell these items as my wife had a baby last week and we need more room to store more stuff so I have to get rid of the stuff I am storing............I know, I know, it sounds contradicting but shes the boss, I just say OK :>)........but anyways if your interested e-mail me and I'll give you my number and we can talk. Thanks for reading this and have a great day.
