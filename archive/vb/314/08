Subject: [VB] passenger side door will not stay locked

hiya -

    I am trying to get my passenger side door to _stay_ locked.  I am pretty sure that the locke mechanism works because I can lock the door when the door is open.  But as soon as close the door I have great trouble getting it to stay locked.  Using the inside door handle will not lock it either.  It will stay locked for a few minutes then one can push the button ( oh yeah... this is 64' with the bush button style door handles ).
    My neighborhood is not particluarly safe for unlocked vehicles. 

thanks
r.
