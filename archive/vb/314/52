Grey,

I've used POR15 over existing well-bonded paint, for extra protection,
with excellent results. You just want to be sure that the paint you're
covering is adhering well, as that is your total adhesion. The POR will
provide the non-porous hard coating. I prefer POR bonding directly to the
metal, as they suggest, but there come these times when you need to be
creative...
