Subject: Re: [VB] passenger side door will not stay locked

Never had this happen.   What I'd do is remove the outside handle and spray 
copious liquid wrench or similar lube in the mecanism and see if that helps.  
Unfortunately to get the outer handle off you have to remove the door panel, or 
actually just enough clips (or screws) at that end of the panel to get to the 
allen head screws.  

with the handle off you can see the lever that you push up/down to 
lock/unlock the door.   If it is falling down like London Bridge, maybe something is 
funky in the mechanism. (I never had this particulur problem so I dunno)

You could even remove the mechanism and clean it in solvent,  see how the 
parts move (it's kinda neato) then grease it liberally.   Or if you see that is 
it funky, find another one.

When the door is closed (claw thing straight up/down) and you press the lever 
that the handle presses, the claw should snap out with a confident "Click!".  
  It shouldn't kinda sorta slowly creep out.  Neither should it refuse to 
leave its hiding place.

hiya -

    I am trying to get my passenger side door to _stay_ locked.  I am pretty 
sure that the locke mechanism works because I can lock the door when the door 
is open.  But as soon as close the door I have great trouble getting it to 
stay locked.  Using the inside door handle will not lock it either.  It will stay 
locked for a few minutes then one can push the button ( oh yeah... this is 
64' with the bush button style door handles ).
    My neighborhood is not particluarly safe for unlocked vehicles. 

thanks
