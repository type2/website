Subject: Re: [VB] Rubberized Coatings - an Interior Rust Preventative?

This is the beauty of the Urethane Bed liner for interior panel use.
It doesn't stink like an asphalt road on the inside of any f my Vans or
Bus.
It won't, shrink, run ,crack, peel, is impervious to any solvents once
it dry--    ( 20 minutes ) and sheds water and condensation like a duck.

I decided to forget about the caveman process years ago--

OH--One more thing---

The bed liner is also a bullet proof undercoating--

Pressure wash the bottom side of the vehicle--let it dry---and spray on
the bedliner--

Let's see---the stuff has been on the bottom on my 85 GL for at least 5
years--my 74 Westy for 3 and still looks good--no shrinking--or rock
chips.

Great stuff---

Forget the roofing tar---Old time stop gap measure's--
Get into the new millennium--:>)
