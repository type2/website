Subject: Re: [VB] Rubberized Coatings - an Interior Rust Preventative?

It's a much better idea to stick the sound barrier in---then apply the
rubberized undercoating if this is what you want to use.

If you applied the undercoating first--you better make sure that the
surface you putting it on is sanded well so that the stuff will stick
well--

Let me suggest even a better product for interior panel corrosion
protection.

Urethane Bed liner.

Unlike the rubberized tar that you mentioned that you want to use--this
stuff is tuff--
Isn't effected by heat--or moisture--and will never come off.

Morton offer's an excellent spray on bed liner--and it's inexpensive.


Take Care,
