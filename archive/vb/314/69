Subject: Re: [VB] z bed questions

Greasy Volks,

All this talk about z beds . . . The guy camped next to me at Havasu in
January had a z bed for saile, $75.  Need to be re-upholseterd.  I
passed on it.  Was this a good deal?  Can you use them in a regular bus
with no shelving like in a Westy?

Curt
