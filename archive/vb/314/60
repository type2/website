Subject: Re: [VB] air cleaner bracket....once agin

well, they are hard to find.   

I think there's a picture of one on my 61 deluxe in the vintagebus.com gallery.

You could make one out of a chunk of metal, cut & drilled to shape.  Use good eye and ear protection when using a grinder!!!

 Note how I put a small adaptor on mine, as I am using a 1600 manifold, which moves the carb left of where it'd be in a 40hp, as I have a large gen and so have to do it that way (or space the carb up a bunch) .   Anyway, the lower holes go under the coil bracket, then measure for the upper hole to fit your air cleaner tube.

If you paint it black, they won't notice it's not stock. :)
