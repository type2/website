If you haven't heard it yet, Bring Your Own Bus 2004 is GO for Saturday 
April 17th at the Red Barn north of Salinas, CA.  There is still Friday 
night camping at the Barn.  Gates will close at 11pm with no exceptions 
whatsoever...we don't care if you're John Kerry coming to party 
down...you're not getting in after 11pm!  ;)

The flyer is available at

Prices really haven't changed from last year, but if you're planning on 
parking in the parking lot on Saturday, the folks at the Red Barn are going 
to charge you $2.  Otherwise it's still $10 to come inside the gates in 
your bus.  Show entry is free and encouraged!
