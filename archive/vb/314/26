Subject: VW Bus Bike Jersey on Clearance at REI

For anyone interested, I found the VW Bus Suntoi Bike Jerseys (both long and short sleeve) on clearance at REI this week.  I got them both for about 40% of retail.
 
I believe the actual pattern is called "Windows". The best bet is to go to www.rei.com and call the branch in Seattle or Redmond.  As of yesterday they had the largest selection remaining.
 
There was a Medium short sleeve here in Tualatin yesterday I can pick it up for someone if they want.  Postage runs about $6.  Of course, you could just call them and have it sent from there as well.


Enjoy your day!
