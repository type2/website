Hi,

www.everybus.com

EB04 is less than a month away! For those of you attending please 
visit the web site and check out the update to directions. The new 
I-85 realignment has opened and is a bit confusing. Also the carabus 
list has had quite a few additions!

Can someone please forward this to the new FMBC list.

Thanks and hope to see you soon!
