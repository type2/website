Subject: Paint colour "Wehrmacht matt sand"?

Hi volks,
I've been trying to find a particular colour number I
saw on a 1939 KdF-Steyr featured as a reader's car in
issue No.1 of the UK mag "Ultra VW".
The owner said he'd painted it "Wehrmacht Matt Sand",
an appropriate colour since it's car from the
beginning of WW2.
I was wondering, though, if anyone knows what number
that colour is?
All I've been able to come across are model paints or
specs on painting methods on military vehicles in
general, mainly tanks.
Any clues or websites that have colour samples?
It's one of the many possible colours I considering
for my bus.
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
