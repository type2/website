Subject: Steering box trouble

Hello all,
Was wondering if anybody knows where I can get a replacement steering box. 
The one on my 66sc has quite a bit of play while driving. I attempted to adjust 
the worm gear thing on the box but it has no effect. either too loose or too 
tight causing binding. Anyway on further inspection I found that the output 
shaft that comes from the box has play. What I am trying to say is that if you 
turn the steering wheel the output shaft moves to one side flexing then the 
wheels. make sense? Can I rebuild this thing? Thanks  Bob
