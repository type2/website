Subject: Someone needed a peice of a bus fuel tank?

Hey all,

	I thought that someone on here mentioned that they needed the outlet
section of a bus gas tank.   If that is you, p-mail me.  I found  that the
gas tank I have has holes that make it unusable, but the threase nipple area
seems to be okay.
