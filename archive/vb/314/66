works just fine... and i even went nuts and had like 1/4" thick in 
some places to kill noise. does stink for maybe one hot summer, then 
is done outgassing. stink was not that bad, either; no eye-watering 
or anything. just a tar smell.
smelled much better than houston!

does get a little softer in the heat, and i did have some problem 
with the rubber mat sticking to it on the rear deck and cargo floor, 
but nothing horrible.
