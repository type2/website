I found that my rack was brazed, not welded.  I had a couple of cracks in
the support legs and repaired them by splitting some electrical conduit,
forming it to the outside as doublers, and brazing it into place.  Only
bad thing about conduit is that it is galvinized, so beware of the fumes
while brazing!
