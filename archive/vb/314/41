Subject: [VB] z bed questions

Hi list -

	I have a z bed in my 64 bus that is from 70' or so bus.  I am going to buy a camper kit from a 67' walk through and am wondering if the z-bed from th 67' is the same dimensions.  The 67 is a westy walk-thorugh ( but that doesn't matter right?)  I just don't want two z bed if I don't need them

	thanks
