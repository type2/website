Subject: need 15 inch bus wheel

I had a flat yesterday driving the 63 singlecab, I ran over a razor knife 
blade and when I stopped there was a strong hissing sound. Tyre goo did not fix 
it and I am driving on my spare.
The spare is a bug wheel and I really would like a spare that is capable of 
taking a 205x15 tyre.
Anyone have one around, or will they be bring one to the Bakersfield Bash, 
Bring your own bus, or Kelley Park.
