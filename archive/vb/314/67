now, IIRC, eric was based in TX at some point, so you KNOW that ain't true!
one summer in austin it was over 100 deg for over a MONTH, at 80% humidity.

seems like winter now, what with the 120 day and 101 night here  in 
phoenix last year ... and it is already 94! (so jim ellis sez - i am 
in minnesota right now).

even then the tar didn't really stink. it DID get soft enough for me 
to scrape away some excess here and there.
