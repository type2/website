Subject: Re: [VB] It's alive! And rear wheel seals are leaking...

it was a 46mm/ late RGB, right.... yup something must have been assembled 
wrong.   Also there is the possibility of rust where something meets something... 
hm where the seal goes, I have seen rust there.    Can't remember offhand 
which was these things go... but the kits are universal... I mean the same kit 
does early or late RGBs, though they use different pieces, so something gets 
leftover each wway, but different things.   I *think* you use the big rubber ring 
for late, but not the little shim.    It's been a while.  

when you have these off, light as well make sure the shoe star keepers are 
good  .  teh spring tabs that keep them from self unadjusting.    if you are 
taking the seals off, you could replace the backing plates, or attach a keeper 
spring tab..

Matt,

Did you get all the correct spacers and the round seal in place? Check
your Bentley manual. What year is it? Clara? where are you - can you help?
My memory of this assembly is bad, and my Bentley's 1500 miles east!

as around the axle stubs.  Both sides are acting the same, so I must have 
missed something.  They are new seal kits, what did I do wrong?
