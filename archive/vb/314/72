--Curt, 

Maybe good deal for a real splitbus seat, but I hooked up an overhead compartment, side closet, z-bed and jumpseat from a 68-72 baywindow for $30.

Guy had it on ebay for $100, but he lived in my town and I told him I'd pick it up that day for way less. 

He just wanted garage space for the 914.
