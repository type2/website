one summer in austin it was over 100 deg for over a MONTH, at 80% humidity.
Hi Craig,
We were more talking daytime high temp not weekly/monthly duration and 
definitely not humidity which has no affect on tar.  ;-)  
  Our project March 1952 sunroof bug from Sweden was barn stored in 1964 
after an accident badly dented the passenger side behind the door.  The insides of 
the fenders and underside of the pan were tarred apperently when new.  The 
tar on some of the fenders was put on too thick and now is cracking off 50 years 
later reveling factory paint that looks like it was put on last week (drool). 
 While the Bahama Brown (Hersey Chocolate bar brown) paint on the top of the 
bug is badly oxidized.
  When Eric took jewlery class back in high school they would etch designs in 
metal.  The material used to protect the metal areas to be left shiney from 
the sulfuric acid (AKA battery acid) used?  Roofing tar!
