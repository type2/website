Subject: Q about safari window size

Hi,

I bought a pair of "vintage" repro safari windows. I have no idea who 
made them. Whoever it was did a decent job on them, with hex fasteners. 
My question is about the size though.

There is about 1/2" gap all the way around. The hinge on the top takes 
up most of the gap, so that the bottom is only 1/16" On either side, 
though, if I move the window to one side, I can poke my finger past the 
window frame and lip.

Is this about right? I want to know if these are crap before I spend 
money on new glass, seals, etc.

Thanks,
Conrad
