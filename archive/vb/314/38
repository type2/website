Subject: 12volts on a 6volt motor

I got a call from an old friend yesterday asking for some advice.  I didn't 
have the answer right away so I thought I'd present what I had to the list and 
ask for input.
He knew I had run 6 volt accessories on a 12 volt beetle by installing two 
6volt batteries in series and running the 12 volt from the second battery and 
the 6 volt stuff from the first battery.
My friend's problem is reversed, he wants to run newer 12volt stuff on a 6 volt 
rig.
What we were contemplating is two six volt batteries, again in series, but what 
we haven't mapped out is the process of putting a 12volt generator on the 
motor, and at what point would you wire the original 6 volt equipment?
Could you run the coil/ignition/starter etc wired from the 1st battery?
Are there any big pitfalls I'm ignoring?

Thanks volks,
