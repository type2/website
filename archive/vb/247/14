Could be.  There's eight ways it can go on, but only one of them is
right.

If I'm reading the '67 parts manual at the doc project correctly:
It looks like as soon as the removable generator pedestal started
(at 3 400 000 with the bastard engine), the 1200 had a paper gasket,
113 101 219.  The early 1500 also had the paper gasket, but at
0 573 913 (late May '64) they went to just the metal baffle.  Check
it out at http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5867part.html , pages
27 (picture) and 37 (list).

The engine in my Bus, a 1500 from a '68 Bug, had just the metal baffle
in it.  I was convinced it was leaking oil around the generator pedestal/
crankcase joint - not a gusher, but a mist.  I found out you can get the
pedestal off by pulling the battery negative cable, taking off the air
cleaner, removing the fan belt, taking off the generator strap, taking
out the screws on either side of the fan shroud, taking off the pedestal
nuts, and lifting the generator and shroud enough to slide the pedestal
out the back.  The new baffle does have a crush ridge around the edge -
I put it in along with a paper gasket.  I'm not sure how much it helped
the oil problem; I now think some of it is coming from around the
crankshaft.  But anyway, you can probably get the pedestal out with
the engine in the Bus, if you want to check the baffle.

I wonder if you have the modification described on page M-12 2 of the
early Bentley or M-14 8 of the later Bentley.  Oil going in the filler
has to get through an 8 mm wide slot before it can go into the crankcase.
If you do have this modification, you'll probably have to take the
generator off to get enough room to lift the pedestal off the baffle
and tube assembly.
