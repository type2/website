Can anyone confirm a rumor that I heard that the OBR's
were sent bulk rate last time? I am wondering because
I placed a change of address with the club, and I
don't think it registered with them because I never
received my last newsletter. And I don't think the PO
will fwd bulk rate mail. I tried looking at there
website but there really isn't any contact info for
help with the change of address issue.
 Mike
