 I took the speedo out today and played with it, and it seems 98%
 of the time, I get this.  Sometimes it works normally.  The switch
 sometimes seems very stiff, too.  
 
 Could be that the switch just gave up the ghost, and I have to accept
 the fact, buy a new one and move on?  >>

yes, get a new switch.   when they spit smoke it's over for them.  I guess 
you could remove it, take the electricals out and examine them though, if you 
really want to.

dunno what it'd have to do with the speedo through
