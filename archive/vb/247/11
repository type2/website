Subject: coloured dash light bulbs

I bought a red sharpie and colored the dash light bulbs for the guages in my 
red bus (61)    It works and looks cool.   We'll see how long it lasts.  Stays 
light so late these days I haven't used my headlights in a while. (light at 
4.30 am, not dark till past 9 pm)  Ya, I'm early to bed, early to rise these 
days.
