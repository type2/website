Hi Mike,
Unless there is some wires seriously burnt we would suggest doing #5.  You 
can use 3Ms Safest Stripper to remove the paint from the wires.  A Euro harness 
is a nice thing to have, the taillights are much safer than the N. American 
all red type.  Soldering and heat shrink are a must for top notch long lasting 
repairs.
