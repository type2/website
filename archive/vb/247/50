Subject: 58 to 61 Lens

    Just recieved some shippments from Europe (not BBT) and in it was some
tail light lens for 58 to 61 buses, ORANGE with all the Hella markings.
These are made from plastic and are beautiful. These were originally used on
buses from OZ and Italian emergancy vehicles (I was informed). Very limited
quanity (I had these made) for one of my projects and don't need the extras.
These are not the raised lip style like were on some OZ buses but flat .
