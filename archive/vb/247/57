I (sglw(-at-)aol.com  63 singlecab) & Clara claralw(-at-)aol.com (too many splitties to 
name) will be flying into Brussels on June 18th at 3:35 PM

We leave our independent ways (Clara for London & Sam for San Francisco) on 
the 24th of June at around noon.
We have not rented a car yet & hope to ride with people from BBT to Bad 
Camberg.
Let us all keep in touch, does anyone have plans for renting a cellphone that 
works in Europe?
