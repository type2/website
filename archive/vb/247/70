 Went to HD today and picked up 100 paving stones to make a small driveway.
 I pulled up to the loading area, gave the guy my receipt and told him what
 I needed:
 HD kid: OK, where's your truck?
 Me: It's right here.
 HD kid: "No, I mean where is *your* truck, so we can put these in it."  
 Me It's right here!
 HD kid: You're going to need a truck to carry these home.  Did you bring one?
 Me: *Yes*!  I'm putting them in my bus.
 HD kid: You can't do that. >>

Pretty funny!!!

I've heard the same thing a few times too.   

When I was a kid my Mom was a potter, worked out of the house.  My folks 
would go get a ton(more?) of clay in the 62 VW bus and haul it home every so 
often.  It was a big pile of rectangular blocks of clay in plastic bags in the 
middle of the bus.  

Working buses are cool.
