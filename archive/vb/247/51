Subject: Cargo Door Latch Mechanism

Has anyone ever dismantled a cargo door latch mechanism?  Mine is broken in
the fact that it does not hold the outer handle in the horizontal postion
anymore, now it sits at 45 degrees.
At 2 swapmeets that I have been to people wanted the equivalent of 45$ for one
of these, which I am not paying!  I am gonna keep my eye out for one at other
swaps, but am considering drilling out the rivets to see if I can fix it.
Worried though as if I dismantle it and can't get it back together I will have
to buy one at 45$... Hmmm decisions!!!
