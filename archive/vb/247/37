Bob,

I'm game.  I am planning on doing the VTO fri. campout in Yucaipa, then 
heading to the OCTO show. I wasnt super thrilled with the Irvine Lake campout so I 
may skip out on that and maybe head to the beach to camp with my girls.

I usually skip out on the Classic, but may do it this year to see an old 
friend from SLC if he comes down.
