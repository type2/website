You say "this year" like it's the first time it's ever 
happened..................
As long as there has been an OCTO meet, there has been an emergancy 
equipment display. Same ole stuff evey year. It was cool *maybe* the 
first 2 times, but now it's just annoying. Hopefully there will be more 
people bring their equipment so there is something new to look at.
