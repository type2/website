Hi all,

With the greatest VW show on this planet about to happen in less than a month,
I'm curious about who on this list will be flying over for all the Vintage VW
festivities in Der Fatherland?  I know for sure that fellow Listee David
"felt-man" Mayes and I will be there driving Vintage VW's for Bob of B.B.T.
fame ( http://www.BBT4VW.com ) in their huge organized Vintage Caravan from
Belgium to the Bad Camberg event and back.  I'm driving a '49 Standard Beetle
and I believe Dave will be in a old Bus from Bob's huge collection.  Anyway,
who else from the VB List will be there?  We probably need to organize a
"re-hydration" event and VW List group photo at sometime during the weekend.
Any thoughts?
