Subject: tight shoes

Finally started on the 57's brakes today. outter bearing seal,  hard lines,
soft lines, and wheel cylinders in the rear. I put the brakes(Enduro srb
166) back on as they came off but the drum didn't want to go back on. I
pulled the drum off and re-oriented the shoes, adjusters backed off as far
as they'll go, tabs seem firmly seated in the wheel cylinder and adjusters
but still the drum is super tight against the shoes. I used more force than
I would have liked and got it on but it's so tight the bus is hard to push
in and out of the garage(no room to work inside). What am I'm missing?

ronnie(no, not that one)
