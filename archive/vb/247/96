Subject: strange ignition switch problem

From the conditions you mentioned, I would recommend the replacement of the 
lock/switch.  The electrical portion is not really meant to be disassembled 
(neither is the lock part, for that matter).  For the time speant to work on 
it and the relative low cost of a replacement, I wouldn't even consider 
anything but replacement.
