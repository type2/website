Most auto parts stores sell screw on oil fill spouts. They are about 3" long and have a on-off valve. You can
adjust the rate of flow. It extends past the vent drain hose. Usually under a buck everywhere. When Kmart had
their closing-the-store-by-me-sale, I got a half dozen of them for a quarter each.
