.............. Now to get a new switch.  Someone mentioned taking the switch 
 apart....  I dont see any screws, guess I could pry it apart.  Now I gotta 
 order a new ignition switch.  Can any locksmith rey-key it?  I don't want my 
 ignition being different than my doors.  In the mean time I guess I will rig 
 up a 3 stage switch or maybe a switch and a button.  Till the new one comes.
 
 Thanks,

just get a new switch. the old ones electricals are trashed.  or you can 
carefully undo (pry off) the tiny snap ring at the point in the middle, and the 
cylinder should be able to be pulled out (insert key, pull w/ key)

to examine the electrics of the dead swicth, see on the sides around the 
circle where the crimps are.  un do the crimps.  pull it apart.   i wonder what it 
looks like in there.  pics?

Be careful of that big red hot wire flopping around.   it is hot.  cover it 
with electrical tape when it's not in use.

about matching keys, you don't say what year bus you have.

67 had L series keys.  you can find new L series locks and get it rekeyed

64-66 had T series keys.   54- 63 had the whatever series they call that

to rekey the ig to the doors, the ig switch must take the same profile 
(shape) key as the doors.
