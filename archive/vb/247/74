Subject: Re: [VB] how popular are crew cabs?

Could depend on where you are located.  Here on the rusty mid-Atlantic 
East Coast they are few and far between.  We just had a big regional VW 
show in northern VA and I was surprised to see two or three very nice 
splitty doublecabs (and one singlecab) in the judging this time.  (As 
long as you don't object to diamondplate bed/gate lining.)  Plus a 
couple of the swappers usually carry their stuff in DCs.

Whenever I bring my DC to a show I invariably hear a few comments of 
"this is great, I used to have one of these and I loved it" from a few 
of the old-timers. (Well, somewhat older than me, anyway.)  I bought a 
heavy rubber pickup truck mat that I trimmed down to size for the bed, 
whenever I need to haul landscaping bricks or bags of manure or 
whatever.  I just pull it up whenever I want to show off.
