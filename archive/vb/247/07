I think you're working on the wrong end of the problem.  You should
try to figure out how to not kick up the dust in the first place.
A Bus is 175 cm wide and your driveway is 241400 cm long.  If you
wanted to cover it with water to a depth of 0.1 cm, you'd need
4225000 cm^3 of water, which is 4225 L.  Conveniently, this is also
about 4225 kg.  Assuming you've got one-ton panel vans, you'll
need 5 Buses to haul this much water.  If you can come up with 4
more Buses, family members to drive them, water tanks, plumbing,
and nozzles on the front bumpers, your problems are over!  :)
