Subject: Strange Ignirion Switch Problem

So I went to start up the bus last night, and I got a good puff
of smoke out of the ignition switch.  From then on, when I turn
the key on (first position) the starter kicks in and the bus
wants to run.   

I took the speedo out today and played with it, and it seems 98%
of the time, I get this.  Sometimes it works normally.  The switch
sometimes seems very stiff, too.  

Could be that the switch just gave up the ghost, and I have to accept
the fact, buy a new one and move on? 

Is this something that could have been caused by malice?  The bus
has been parked on the street - could someone have been mucking 
with it and caused this (ever the suspicious one, I)

Anyone have Gabriel's # handy?

I took the double cab to the h/w store this afternoon, and there's a girl
working there with a super beetle.  She went ape over the truck, and then
"I'm having this idle problem with my bug..."
