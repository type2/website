Hmm.  If your double-cab was originally US-spec, it should have had a
nine prong box.  If this is the case, then someone has replaced the
nine prong box with a two-prong flasher and a jumper wire.  If there
were a few disconnected wires hanging out near the flasher, that's
probably what has happened.

The flasher on a Euro-spec '67 would have had three terminals, but one
of them is ground and could have been done through the case or mounting
stud.

The two wires you have are probably the feed from the fuse box and the
wire to the turn signal switch.  The new box may need an additional
ground wire to work.  Is there anything marked on the new box, like
a schematic, or numbers/letters by the terminals?  It can probably
be made to work with the right connections.

Otherwise, go to the FLAPS and buy a generic two-prong flasher, like
a #552.  Use a test light to figure out which wire is the feed and
plug that wire onto the X terminal of the flasher.  Plug the other
wire onto the L terminal of the flasher.
