I don't know how popular they are, but if you have ever owned one you
will never be without one. I had my 60 Double Cab for 9 yrs. and it is
the most useful vehicle I have ever owned. They are the best. You can
haul a good size load and still comfortably carry 5 people. The heat
works better because it is such a small area to keep warm. The way the
gates all drop down they are really easy to load and super easy to clean
the bed out. My wife used mine for hauling horse poop (for fertilizer)
all the time and you can simply drop the gates and hose it out. At the
dump you can show the fee collectors how small the bed is, but with
strategic use of plywood you can get a huuuuge load in there and usually
only get charged the minimum fee. Check out thesamba.com or
vintagebus.com or dropgates.com to find what is available out there.
They are spendy compared to a regular 15 window but cheap compared to a
23 window (and way more useable).

Good Luck,
