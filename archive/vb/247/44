Subject: RE: [VB] Re-sleeving early brake cylinders

There are several places that do this type of work... its not really
cheap.  I looked into it when I needed to fix the speed control MC on
the v80.  I think the quote I got for a resleaved single port MC was
about $150.  Luckily, I was able to salvage what I had by careful
cleaning and a little bit of honing.  I'd say the $75 per is not out of
place if they are the ATE brand.  Buy new now and save your old ones
until the day when they really get expensive!!!

If you still want to have your old ones rebuilt, look in Hemmings or
search on Google.

Anybody had any luck restoring pre 63 front brake cylinders ?
The cost of these cylinders NOS is now pretty high - $75 each!
