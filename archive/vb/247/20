Hi Roger,
We use Castrol 10-30 Wt during the winter, and 30 Wt during the warmer 
seasons when temps are going to be well above 40F.  20-50 Wt acted more like 40 Wt 
and resulted in too high of start up oil pressure during the winter.  We just 
do not trust mulity wieghts not to break down in a 210F+ hot engine.
