Subject: Generator max output 55V?!?!?! More weirdness...

Alright,
So my wife has fried a couple of voltage regulators in her 70 Westy (1600 with generator).  I did some research and found a tech article on-line about how to test MAXIMUM generator output by disconnecting the regulator, grounding the DF post, hooking up the voltmeter to the D+ post, etc.  The article said I should get a maximum of about 35 Volts on the voltmeter but I am getting higher than 55 Volts output!! I used the same voltmeter on my other bus and got correct readings, so the Voltmeter is good and reading funky... So WTF?!?!? How or Why can this happen??

PEACE!
