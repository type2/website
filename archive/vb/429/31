Subject: Re: [T2] Collector Car Insurance on Westy (for real use.)

We Use Good Sam's Camper insurance., was National General which has 
moved to be High Point in NJ.  All you need is one camper, others are 
covered also. In 26 years of our 2 vans (one used by daughter) we have 
had only liability and comprehensive- and make sure you are not at fault 
in an accident and we are covered if we hit a deer or a tree falls on 
it.  Oh yes- don't hit a tree avoiding the deer, as that is not covered!
Lots of deer here, have had 2 accidents with them, but not with the 
vans- I think they can heare them coming for half a mile.  No accidents 
in 30 years otherwise. Due to the restrictions I have not used collector 
insurance or NJ collector plates, which means no inspection but check of 
milage used.
