Subject: spare parts/travel list?

Hey guys,

 

I am fully confused with the new website archive search. The fact that the
subject of the posts does not show up, almost makes the search useless.

 

I have tried the old one, but can't find some stuff I know we talked about
in the past.I've finally got my '65 going again, mostly done with the work
on it-but the finishing touches can wait- I want to go camping. I remember a
few times there being some chatter about 'what to bring' when traveling in
your bus, from spare parts to tools.

 

My bus had accumulated a lot of stuff in it over the years, in the interest
of starting fresh, I thought I would review the list that was developed over
several postings, but now I can't find it online or in our archives.

 

Anyone know what I'm talking about, or where I could find this info? Tips on
searching the archives?
