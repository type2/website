What kind of regulator are you using john? Get one of the new solid state Bosch units and you should be good to go.might have to order it as your flaps probably won't have it....they run

Alright, So took the battery to my FLAPS and they tested it, and yes, BAD CELL.  OK, new battery.  Flaps also had a new Voltage regulator, so I got it too.  $107 bucks and 30 minutes later I am back in the garage, install new battery and voltage reg and fire it up with voltmeter on battery. Woohoo, everything seems good. 12.9 volts at idle goes up to 14.5 at high rpms, then drops back down to 12.9 as rpms drop.  Take it for a drive and park again and nowthe new volt reg is SMOKING!!  It's very hot!!  Then with the key "OFF" the red gen dash light starts glowing, which of course means fried regulator, right?!?  So I put the voltmeter on the D+ post of the generator instaed of the battery and it is pumping out over 16 volts...

Soooooo, it is possible that I have a bad generator that is overcharging to an extent that it keeps frying voltage regulators??

PEACE!
