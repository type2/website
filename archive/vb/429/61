Subject: Re: [VB] gasket seal?

I've had problems with the quality of carb kits and exhaust parts.  
Sealers probably won't help much, especially with leaky exhaust  
gaskets. I've recently had leaky accelerator pump diaphram issues.  
They spray gas from the sides of the cover. The new diaphrams are  
made of too thin material....
