Hi All,

I recently, a few hundred miles ago, installed an SVDA dizzy. (Got a great 
price on it too BTW) So over the great VW weekend here in So. Cal. last 
month, I noticed that power had dropped off dramatically on the freeway. Had 
trouble getting it up to 65. Had to nurse it slowly. Once I got there and 
backed off a little on the accellerator pedal, speed would move on up to 70 
with little difficulty. Wierd, why would there be more power as the pedal 
goes up?

Figured it out last night. Timing was at zero degrees. Seems that the 
combination of the mechanical advance and the vacuum advance would kick in 
when I lifted my foot up on the pedal creating more vacuum thereby advancing 
the dizzy.

The cause for the timing change, the rub block on the points was wearing 
down. Not enough lube on the dizzy cam. So I lubed the dizzy, reset the 
point gap back to spec, reset the timing to about 8-9 degrees and now all is 
well. Full advance mechanical and vacuum together is running in the 40 
degree range.

Anyone else have this happen?
