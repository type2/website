What Jim Said....
For a stock rig with the factory (lack) of horsepower, most any Name  
brand
75/90 oil will work. I prefer the synthetics for the additive package  
and
overheating resistance. The oils have changed so much in the last 10+  
yrs
that the old GL4/GL5 argument is not an issue as none of the name brands
will eat your synchro's these days.
Redline changed their additives and I don't have any concrete experience
with Royal Burple. We higher powered heavy as hell Syncro's use Swepco  
210
these days..
Just change it every 2 yrs or so and remember when doing so...
Remove the fill plug first..Why ?? If it gets stuck you won't be able to
refill it and end up with an empty tranny till you can finagle it outta
there.
Any questions..just holler..(I'm used to it, been married my whole  
life...)
