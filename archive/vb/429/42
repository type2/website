Well, that is a bit of a crapshoot and could be very unrealistic. Of course
for liability, there is no way to "bank the money." You have to have it, or be
a louse or risk total loss of your life/home/existence in the case of an
accident. Now if I could find a company in AK to insure the bus at value for
more than liability, but instead I banked the difference, sure I could bank
probably $600 a year. With essentially no interest in bank accounts, and a
tumultuous economy for other investments, I'd basically presume 2-3% at best,
and that is 25 years. Long time to chance it.
 
For me the bulk of the restrictions by the collector companies are fine, I am
garaging the vehicles, have several daily drivers (always got to have a loaner
car for guests in AK in addition to wife and my drivers) etc, etc.  Mileage
unlikely to be an issue, it is only the "you can't camp in it" bit that is the
major rub.
 

As another flip having just had over $200k in medical bills, I am certainly
glad I wasn't trying to self insure myself against a rather unexpected,
and uncommon for my age cancer.
