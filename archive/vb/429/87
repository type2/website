Chris, I've had some shitty quality rubbing blocks of non Bosch origin, and
the same effect on stockers, but presumably with a new dizzy, one would have
expected some sort of marginal Bosch south america quality...  Presuming it
was a real SVDA, there are Asian copies are there not?  I don't really know,
I've never seen one, though I do need one for the SC, where was the great deal
from?

The cause for the timing change, the rub block on the points was wearing
down. Not enough lube on the dizzy cam. So I lubed the dizzy, reset the
point gap back to spec, reset the timing to about 8-9 degrees and now all is
well. Full advance mechanical and vacuum together is running in the 40
degree range.

Anyone else have this happen?
