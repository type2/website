Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Collector Car Insurance on Westy (for real

All dthe vehicles that I have are insured by Liberty Mutual.  That is currenly
3.  I have my house insurance and two other cars insured with Nationwide.  I
think of the situation as something that indulges me since if someone wanted
me to insure a 60 year old toaster that they said was worh 25k and they only
used it once in a while I would be leary.
At least some companies will insure them and it is an actuarial table that
gives them the odds of the losses over many years.  And they are
accommodating.  Move the insurance from one to another when you want to drive
them.  I have regular insurance since if I have an accident and it is a total
loss, I have it covered.  I got tired of show me a picture and show me the
garage and what is the value deals.  figure it out by dollars per hour of use.
Use your own judgement after that.  Jim Morris in Charleston.

Eh.  I went through all of that with the collector car insurance companies
a few years ago, just before the '66 got wrecked.

End result was that, for me, none of them would cover a camper or a truck
('66 so-44, and '60 1 ton international pickup).    Grundy got the
closest, and I filled out the paperwork, sent pictures and check, and got
my official rejection letter at that point - I'd have to go dig it up.


With all of that said, I personally know a guy on thesamba who totalled
his (split) westy and got full payout from either Grundy or Hagerty (I
forget, even though it was only a few weeks ago at CTS that I talked to
him...).  All of his buses had been covered for years and years on his
dads policy, and he finally started his own with his latest single cab
purchase.

He definitely camps in his buses, though he was on his way to BulliBrigade
when his wreck happened, so "on my way to a show" wasn't arguable..


To quote an email from Hagerty, (mind you they soon started running TV ads
with a VW camper in them after they told me this...):

"Secondly, we do not consider vehicles that are designed for camping
purposes or vehicles that are used for any kind of hauling, towing,
off-roading or for running errands in general.  "


Ah - I found my rejection from Grundy, asking for $20k coverage on my '66
SO-44 in 2005:

"
1.  Vehicle is not restored.

2.  Value is unrealistic.

3.  All trucks/vans must be restored and maintained for shows.
"

Mind you, that's pure horseshit.   So you can't have an original vehicle,
only restored, and they will out of hand reject a number without
justification even though they clearly state that -you- define the value
with the amount you choose to pay.


So all it all it seems like a crapshoot.   Maybe you'll get insured, but
who knows if they'll decide to reject your claim when it comes in.
