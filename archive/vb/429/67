Subject: re:camping using the bus vs working on the bus...

Time.yeah I need more of that too. 

 

I have been able to take my '65 for a  couple mini-trips so far this summer.
I've been dying to get some pics online to show you guys how far your help
has gotten me. I also need to do more work on it too-a lot of finishing
touches, but for now I'd rather just camp in it. I am a little wary of using
it, and never doing the finishing touches, but I figure using it is what it
is for, and it gives me some opportunity to learn some small adjustments I
can make while doing the finishing touches..

 

As for sleeping in it, my wife thought the cushions were too firm, so we got
one of those egg crate things to put on top of them. She likes this a lot
more. I'm thinking of actually putting the egg crate thing under the
upholstery, so the seats are 'permanently' a bit softer on top. But I'll
need time to do that.anyone ever try that?

 

Then my '69 needs the rear wheels looked at-brake work done, possibly rear
wheel bearings, do the CV joints at the same time.wish I had time to take it
all apart. It is getting to the point of paying someone to do it, or just do
it myself.not sure which route to go.

 

Then again. I just want to drive the thing.

Was writ:

"bus besides getting only 11mpg bus behaved like a champ up and back...only
200miles each way.  slept like a baby, must be something about communing
with my bus...  still have the exhaust leak to take care of but have parts
just need time...."
