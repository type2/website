Owner's Manuals on thesamba.com show 8 & 15 Amp fuses used in the 1958 manual,
but does not show placement, and 8 Amp only in the 1960-64 replacement manual.
     Either way you need to find and fix a short in your right tail light or
license plate light.  Is your left taillight working?  It should be, even with
that fuse blown.
