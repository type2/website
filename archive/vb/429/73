Subject: sound proofing test

Well, Chris asked about sound readings in my bus.

I drove it to Cape Cod this past week, and did a little testing with the
radio shack meter. Looks like I get somewhere between 95 and 97 decibels
while driving at ~55 mph

 

Still too loud. But I think it is much better than it ever was. 

 

I didn't think of it until I got home, but I should have taken a reading
while coasting at 55-then I could see what is sound from road, what is sound
from engine. 

 

I think a lot of sound comes to the front thru the heater tube. I still have
the original pipe and pipe insulation on the main section of pipe. I am a
little concerned about taking this off-afraid of what I might find, and
maybe unable to put it back. But if I could, I would replace this pipe with
some sort of long muffler. I think that would kill a good bit of noise.

 

What sort of readings did you get chris? Or anyone else try DB readings?
