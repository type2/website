Subject: RE: [VB] bearings?

Hey Gary,

I thought they would be different, but just thought I would check. It looks
like one set of the bearings I have (SKF 211 501 283) is supposed to be the
rear wheel outer roller bearing (-at-) stub axle for a '64-'70 bus. This is
according to one of the VW online vendors. So this looks interchangeable. 

These other bearings could even have been from when I had my '71 squareback,
but I don't remember ever getting bearings for my squareback, so probably
not.

Hi Kevin,
	I can't help with the cross reference but replacing the bearing on a

'69 will be much easier than on the '65 from where your parts stash  
comes from. They are mostly different. Gary
