Hi Kevin,
	It makes good sense to do everything to the axles, bearings and  
brakes on the rear of your '69. I'd do it myself. The quality of the  
wheel bearings is a grab bag, but new may well be a whole lot better  
than what you've got. I buy bearings in town from a shop that mostly  
sells bearings to local mines. I did all of this on my '74 Super 5-6  
years ago and it feels great driving it knowing that all is good, at  
least back there.  Gary
