Subject: Re: [T2] Generator stumping issue - Complete message

ok.... after re reading..

you stated HIGH RPMS....   that test proves that your generator is working ,
and has good residual magnetizm in the field iron.
the test you were doing is only meant to be done at idle, and about
1200rpm... no higher is neccessary to prove it working

and,, you have  a DELCO sealed regulator,, which I know nothing about,, but
I suspect it doesn't have a current limiting relay in it..
if there is no current sense ,, current limit relay,, the generator will put
out a lot of current, and cook the regulator pretty quick, and the battery
after a few hours , when it boils dry.

I can only find the E694 delco regulator,, and I don't think it is a sealed
unit..

I would recommend you get another replacement regulator that you can
determine has a current limiting relay in it..
like , from Altrom, 0 190 350 063  replaced by 0 190 350 068
it is avail thru Napa.. CiP

> Allright, I have been told that it is not possible for the generator on
the wife's 70 westy to put out enough voltage to fry regulators...HOWEVER, I
am telling you all that I have run the following test for maximum output
multiple times with the same results (I even tested another bus to make sure
I was doing the test right, and those reults were fine).... AFter working
perfectly in the bus for 2 years, this generator is generating up to 60
VOLTS AT IDLE AND 100 VOLTS AT HIGH RPMS!!  Has anyone EVER heard of this
issue happening before and why???
