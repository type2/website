Hi John,
We went with State Farm liability Insurance, and double up the medical
coverage just in case you hit a school bus full of kids.  Add Comprehensive
for acts of god and theft can be added for like $8.00 per year.
    Then ask how much full coverage would be, and figure out the difference
between the two.  Open a bank account and put in that difference every six
months and do not touch it except for repairs/accidents to your VW.
  That way you handle most of the $$$ and do not have to pay a company to do
it all for you.
E&B
