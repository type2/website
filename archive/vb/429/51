Really....
 
Anybody on here just come into a reasonably priced house worth of value
selling their '63.  Deluxe 23 window, apparently went $198k before commission
on Barrett Jackson yesterday, same bidder bought a hemi Challenger R/T
immediately previously for a mere $195k.  Must be nice all round.
