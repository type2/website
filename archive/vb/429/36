Subject: Re: Insurance

Some decades ago I found a number of companies advertising in 
Hemmings who would insure cars for their actual replacement value, 
which can be realistically quite HIGH, but you had to store them 
indoors in a climate controlled environment and could drive them ONLY 
for maintenance and to exhibitions. I believe the home company was in 
PA and I am in CA, but I also believe they have local spot checkers 
who show up to see if your car is really stored in a climate 
controlled environment.  Like the old Briggs-Cunningham Museum used 
to be. I have friends who thought of driving their cars into the 
living room, but the zoning laws of California do not LIKE this, the 
having of a petroleum engine in a living space.

I think the idea of banking the cost of insurance is much better than 
paying an insurance company, I have always thought of insurance as a 
kind of crap table, and the house always wins.

If people including me, had the self control to bank the money they 
regularly fork over to insurance companies, the PEOPLE would be in 
much better condition to take care of stuff and things as they happen.

I am not fond of insurance companies.
