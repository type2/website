What condition are the pipes on your heater boxes?
If they are pitted, of course there will be exhaust leaks where the muffler
goes on the heater boxes.
I would either find nice og heater boxes, or weld up and grind down the pipes.
The donuts should be a snug fit.

You can also use the copper high temp sealing goo to fill in the gaps, but
that won't work if you have big gaps.
 If bad pipes are the problem, make your pipes good.
evidently the new heater boxes are not as good quality as the old german
ones.
