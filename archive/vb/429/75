Subject: re:Soundproofing test

Hi Chris,

 

Yes I did the test on the "C" scale like you asked. I don't think the sound
got louder if I went faster, than again my bus doesn't go much faster. 

 

I do not have a walk-thru.

 

I have replaced the original vinyl upholstery with a fabric upholstery-as
per listee's suggestions. I had the bus filled with some stuff for a weekend
trip, and actually had the bed out-and covered with a packing blanket and a
85 lb dog. The only vinyl seat covering is the front seats. 

 

I really like the fabric I picked for the bus rear seats, but I don't know
how much the fabric helps with sound, compared to the ease of cleaning with
vinyl-this kind of makes me keep  packing blanket in the bus at all times
for my dog, who has a tendency to roll in things that don't smell so good.

 

I understand the roof is all a hard surface, and all my panels are a hard
wood. This causes the sounds to bounce around longer, but the bus also has
lots of soft surfaces, I have not finished putting the carpet on the floor
in the back yet.

 

At this point I think the noise issues are coming from the engine, and I've
got to get some sound insulation into the engine compartment itself, and
also a long muffler-type pipe as I think sound resonates right up the heater
pipe.

 

I should take the sound meter into my '02 Saab, to compare. Have you done
any comparison to a modern vehicle? What sound level do you think the target
should be?

 

According to OSHA, we should not be exposed to noise this loud for more than
2 hours.

"Hey Kevin,

 

If you were making your measurements on the 'C' weighted scale, you have
about the same as I do except that I see that sound level doing 65-70mph. At

55 its much quieter, but still loud.  If you use the other scale (A? B?) you
should see around 84db.

 

I can't remember. Do you have a walk thru?

Mine is non-walk thru. I believe that part of the problem is that the cab
about the right size to resonate. Adding 1/2" of rebond visco-elastic carpet
padding and a nice upholstery fabric on the front door panels helped my bus
a lot. If I can figure a nice way to do it, I'll also do the kick panels and
the cab side of the partition. Too many hard surfaces to bounce the sound
around. Can't do much for all the wood camper paneling in the back. I plan
to someday replace all the vinyl seat coverings with cloth. That should also
help some.
