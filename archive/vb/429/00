Well, I tried to reply from my phone and got busted by the list
server. Besides being impossibly hard to type, the response window
didn't give me any option to quote or not, so I see it quoted anyway.
But here's what I was trying to say:

Since I don't usually have spare parts, I start at the other end. How clean
are the connections at the starter? What happens if you apply 12v
directly to the solenoid from the battery?
