If you search for the term your looking for, the results displayed will =
be only for that. The means you kind of don't even need to the subject =
line. There are notes on how to use the search engine. Should the =
subject line be there? Absolutely. The finished product will also =
contain an excerpt of each message below it, as a preview. I've been =
working on this in my "spare" time. Once I get some conflicting perl =
modules taken care of, we should be good to go.

For now, here is the details on looking at archived email.

1. Use the archive browser. This has all messages listed in real time, =
but is not searchable. Forget about the vanagon link, it's hosed.

2. Use the search engine. If you were looking for this thread =
specifically, you would wrap your query in quotes and it would look =
something like this "spare parts/travel list"  Only emails that have the =
exact string will come back. Now, if you try that today, you won't get =
this exact thread because I've not updated the archives recently (I =
should though.) I've focused more on getting the subject line thing =
taken care of that putting a script together to automagically update the =
search index.

So, there's your options for now. If everything goes to my exact plans, =
world domination should be acquired in about a week. I'll let you know =
otherwise :)

Peace,
Your friendly type2.com admin
