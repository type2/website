Congratulations to Adam and Richard for a great article getting published.

I went on that trip in 2004 and 2006. I didn't finish in 2004 because
the bus was rushed together to make the trip, and when the snow
started to fall, I had no wipers.

I have only one photo from 2004. In the first photo, my bus is second
from the rear, a white 62 double door walk-thru. In 2006 I am in a
White and Red 58 standard more suited for this type of trip.
