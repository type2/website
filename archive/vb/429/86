Subject: Re: [VB] OK here is a post.

Yeah, I'm running an old Delta MK10B capacitive discharge system, however I 
still rely on the mechanical points. I suppose that an electronic 
replacement would also work and save me the points hassle. However in the 
past, I could run 8-10k miles in between resetting the timing and the points 
would last almost forever.

stuck an electronic ignition inside first chance I had when I picked up my 
61SC,
