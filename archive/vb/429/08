Howdy Campers!

Who will be headed over to the OCTO show next Saturday?
I'll be there with my 64DD Kamper.
Show flier at:  http://www.octo.org/files/index.php?id=15

I'll also be at The Classic at the Verizon Amphitheater on Sunday June 12.

Chime in, let's see how many listees are going to the shows.
