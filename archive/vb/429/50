Hi Harry,
Would check that the wires to the taillight running lights are not wired by
DPO on same fuse.
   If wired properly, the left should work unless electricity is not getting
to it, or there is a connection problem in the taillight for that filament, or
the filament is just burnt out.
   As for the right side you just have to find the short.
Plus add ground wires to the taillights that go to where the battery ground
cable bolts to the body is a must for any VW bus to work at all well.
E&B
