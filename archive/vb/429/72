Subject: Soundproofing

Was asked - How did all the sound proofing turn out? Did you ever manage to
get some noise level readings?

 

No readings yet, but it is getting quieter. I realized I had a lot of noise
coming up through the heater duct- I had taken out one of the heat duct
mufflers, so it was just open, and acting like a sound tube from the engine
right to the dash. Putting that in made a big difference. I still need to
re-install a couple door seals. The cargo door middle seal-when I put the
replacement in, I can't shut the doors, without it -the doors shut ok. I
also have not put in one of the doors seals on each front door. 

 

I think I have eliminated a lot of road noise, and the insulation seems to
have helped keep the bus cooler when in direct sunlight. I think the bus is
actually not leaking at any windows. 

 

It seems like the main noise is a low level drone.probably just from the
engine. 

 

I'm driving to the cape this weekend, I'll be with my wife, so I'll see if I
can get her to use the decibel meter to take some readings while I'm
driving.
