I've never been in an accident that was my fault. Maybe I'm gambling, but 
I'm counting on continuing that trend. I was with Integon General for 30 
years. Never made a claim, but the rates continued to rise. I paid $1330/yr 
for a Toyota and two busses. The busses do not carry collision. So I 
switched to Erie, same coverage. That move cut my premiums to $681/yr.  If 
the busses are totaled, so be it.
