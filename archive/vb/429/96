Subject: RE: Mail archive access

Looks to be working now.

 

I'm not sure if you want immediate feedback.or if I should play with it for
a while.but I'll give the immediate feedback anyway.

 

I try: Front End Replacement

 

Looks like it works.  Yet if I pick option 3, the text does not wrap(makes
for very difficult read), if I pick option 5, text does wrap. Is this an
easy fix?

 

I like the preview-that is great, what I was looking for before!

I also like to see the  whole 'subject' line, that helps eliminate things
clearly not related, it also  helps me to build a better search query.

 

I miss the ability to read an entire thread, either all at once, or one post
at a time. Is that there, and I am just missing it? Ie after running a
query, then finding a post that looks related, I just see the one post, but
not the responses.        

 

I like that you added "Browse mail archives" either that is new, or I missed
it before. But that is something I was looking for.

 

Thanks for the improvements.they make the site much more useful.

Apache was doing what I configured it to do instead of what I told it to do.
Go figure.

 

It should be better now?
