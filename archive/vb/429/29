Wow,

Must have been 300 or more splits at the OCTO show today at Anaheim Stadium.
Great show, great raffle prizes, Great People too. The guy next to me was in 
a 66 double door camper that he drove out from Pennsylvania! Nice having 2 
double door campers parked adjacent to one another.

On to the Classic at Verizon Amphitheater in the morning.
All for now.
