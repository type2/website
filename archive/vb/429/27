I've had no charging issues with my 12 volt VWs once I changed the  
generators out for alternators with built in voltage regulators. I  
know that this is not going to fix your generator/voltage regulator  
problems. My first guess is that the dead battery damaged the  
generator? Bad/weak batteries should be replaced pronto.
