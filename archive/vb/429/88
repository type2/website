A friend asked me to install a SVDA dizzy on his bug and it was not a  
stock VW ignition part. It's origin and manufacturer was unclear. I  
understand that there are new latin american VW distributors out  
there but this was not one. The directions said to time it to 40*  
btdc at full advance. This gave it an idle advance of around 15*  
btdc.  My friend likes the way it runs. It seems all wrong to me.

I have seem the rubbing blocks break on non Bosch points! Also, I  
have an old Bosch SVDA distributor on the '74 Super and it works  
great  Gary Gibson
