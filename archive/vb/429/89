Well, Chris, you asked, I'll tell my story.

I've been driving around the country more or less for two years, living in 
my bus. Toward the end of June I was up in Northern New Mexico in the 
Taos/Santa Fe area and I noticed the bus didn't seem to have the old spirit. 
BTW, 1970 Westy, dual port engine.

On a hot day, July 1, 95 degrees, I drove the 300 miles from north of Taos 
to Lake Caballo, south of Truth or Consequences.  The last 50 miles or so I 
was really struggling up grades. Finally she overheated and wouldn't run. I 
let her cool down for an hour and then limped the last 50 miles on two 
cylinders to my camp site, sure that I had cooked the engine in the heat.

The heads are more than 10 years old with more than 60,000 miles on them, so 
I decided it was time for a top end rebuild.  I ordered new heads, pistons 
and jugs, gaskets -- all the stuff I thought I needed to do the job.

But while I waited for the parts to arrive I got thinking.  And the more I 
thought about it the more I thought it sounded like a timing issue.  So, a 
few days ago I, opened the distributer, checked the points (in there for 3 
years) and, just as you found, the rubber had worn down. I put in new 
points, gapped them, fiddled with the timing. Presto! The bus runs fine. 
Plenty of power. All 4 cylinders.

I was too embarrassed before to admit jumping to such expensive conclusions. 
But I figure, ah, well. Might as well share.  Now I've got $800 worth of 
parts arriving next week. Gonna have to figure out what to do with them, but 
the good news I don't have to pull the engine.

Cheers,

John Rogers

Hi All,

I recently, a few hundred miles ago, installed an SVDA dizzy. (Got a great
price on it too BTW) So over the great VW weekend here in So. Cal. last
month, I noticed that power had dropped off dramatically on the freeway. Had
trouble getting it up to 65. Had to nurse it slowly. Once I got there and
backed off a little on the accellerator pedal, speed would move on up to 70
with little difficulty. Wierd, why would there be more power as the pedal
goes up?

Figured it out last night. Timing was at zero degrees. Seems that the
combination of the mechanical advance and the vacuum advance would kick in
when I lifted my foot up on the pedal creating more vacuum thereby advancing
the dizzy.

The cause for the timing change, the rub block on the points was wearing
down. Not enough lube on the dizzy cam. So I lubed the dizzy, reset the
point gap back to spec, reset the timing to about 8-9 degrees and now all is
well. Full advance mechanical and vacuum together is running in the 40
degree range.

Anyone else have this happen?
