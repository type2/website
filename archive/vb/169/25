Hi Linda&Bob,
Congrats on your first trip!
If the red light was dim and only shows when you have headlights on you need 
to clean and solder connections in your wiring system and fuse box.  Check 
type2 library on how to rebuild your headlight switch, this will not only get 
rid of the red light , but most likely make your headlights much brighter.
  If the red light was real bright.  Check you wiring for bad or shorting 
connections and especially the generator brushes for wear.
