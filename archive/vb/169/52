Subject: RE: [VB] Crying kids and road trips- what music calms them

We had a modified version of that on our last trip to Vernal Utah. We did
our research and found enough children songs to cover the alphabet. We would
start up the session as soon as the first "are we there yet" began by saying
"what song begins with the letter "A"? Of course they may or may not have
one but we were prepared. Play the game often enough and it starts sticking
in their little heads. The littlest one couldn't play but was fascinated by
the sometimes excited competiveness around him by the other two. And they're
right. Kids can sing the same thing over and over again and never get bored.
It might drive the driver mad, but the kids are occupied.

Oooooh, finally a question I can answer authoritatively.

1. YOU sing. You can sing the same thing over and over if you don't know 
many songs, because they like repetition anyway. This works 100% of the 
time.

2. If for some reason you can't sing, it don't hurt 'em to cry. But it's 
better to sing.

3. Top Recorded Music for Kids that Adults Can Still Stand:

	Momma Come Quick (Bonnie Raitt)

	The Man in the Moon is Smiling (Harry Connick, Jr.)

	The Recipe for Love (Harry Connick, Jr.)

	I'm an Old Cowhand (Harry Connick, Jr.)

	Would You Rather Be a Mule (Dave Van Ronk)

We've had good luck with Spin Doctors, Blues Traveller, Susan Tedeschi, 
Doctor John and Bonnie Raitt the Goddess of the Universe. Children's 
music that (surprisingly) does not trigger a gag reflex in adults 
includes soundtracks from Disney's "Lion King" and "Beauty and the 
Beast". You can skip over the Elton John parts if you want and they 
don't really mind.
