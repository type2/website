No, I was just working in the cab.  As you now know, pushing the shifter
into the socket tends to move the shift rod and bracket under the Bus
away from the floor so it's hard to put the bolts in... Having another 
person to hold the rod/bracket up while you push the shifter down and
bolt it down, like you did, would be a lot easier...

Open a new bottle of oil and pour it into the filter until the filter
is full, then quick screw it on the engine before the oil goes all over.
Look at the oil bottle - now you know about how much more than your
normal fill to add.  Another way is to estimate the volume of the
filter can (hint - 1 cubic centimeter is 1 milliliter), assume maybe 
a third to a half of it is taken up by filter, and put that much extra
oil in.  Use the dipstick as your final judge - let the oil drain back
for several minutes before checking.
