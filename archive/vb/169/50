I ordered my Safari Windows from Dave Palmer's right before Xmas.  I phoned
them on a Monday morning early, because of the time difference.  I spoke
with Mandy who was very knowledgeable and helpful.  I received the Safari's
at my doorstep, (Pasadena, Cal) on the following Saturday morning.  I had a
couple of questions during the installation process, phoned Mandy in the UK,
and she was very helpful.

This was 10-11 months ago, but most people cannot believe it when I tell
them how fast the turnaround was on my Safari's.

I'll be interested to see if anyone else answers this post with a different
experience.
