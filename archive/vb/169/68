Subject: Re: [VB] Crying kids and road trips- what music calms them

well here are some artists we listen to with my kids ( 2 and 6 year old)

Start with Tom Petty wild flowers , move into some Zeppelin, then go to
Black Sabbaths Greatest hits, next comes Metallica Master of puppets, after
that roll gently into some CCR, then to Neil young Harvest, and finish it
off with Bob Dylan's Blood on the Tracks.  you could also throw in some
Holst, sevendust,megadeth, rage against the machine, Violent Femmes ,
beasties, Byrds and L7

Later- Bryan

75 Campmobile
