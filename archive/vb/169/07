Insulation/quieting material is a matter of personal taste.  It sure
does make the door sound more solid when you close it, though.  Make
sure the drain holes in the bottom of the doors are clear.  Also, get
some thin plastic sheeting, glue it to the inside door frame, and trim
so that it is hidden right underneath the door panel.  This will cut
down on water warpage of your door panels.  For glue, simple rubber
cement works fine if the metal is clean.
