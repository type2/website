Subject: RE: [VB] Panel in Kombi clothing?

Funny you should ask.  I have a friend with a 66 Sundial Camper, documented
and everything.  It has the camper windows cut through the sides, as Sundial
tended to do, with no window behind the cargo doors.  Thing is, it DOES NOT
have louvres in the rear and up top, as I thought all panels did.

What a mystery! !
