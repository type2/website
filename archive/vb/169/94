Subject: '66 Sunroof Bows - Question

Hi all,

I am in the process of rebuilding the sunroof on my 66 Samba, and I have a 
question about the size of the bows in the sunroof.  This sunroof was held 
together by duct tape and a prayer, and the duct tape was primarly used to 
hold extra lengths of metal to the ends of three of the four sunroof bows.  
Once I got the tape off and held the bows up against one another, I 
discovered that each was a different length.  The longest of them (which 
appears to be the correct length, to me, anyway) had two screw holes on 
either side of the bow.  The shorter ones had two screw holes on one side 
and one screw hole on the other.

My question is: What have I got here?  Were the bows actually meant to be 
different lengths, or should they all be the same length -- and if so, what 
is that length?

Any help (and perhaps diagrams) would be greatly appreciated!
