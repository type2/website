Subject: Buckin' Bus!

Hey All,

Every since the generator pulled out of my shroud I've been having bucking 
behavior.  Bus only is cool on the highway.  Now that is even getting bad.  
My idiot light r still acting up.  I'm still holding charge though.  I 
definitely have some kind of electrical gremlin and a spark or fuel issue.  
Replaced point, fuel filter, set timing to no avail.  Going to replace my 
condesor (009) Sat.  Coil is about a 1.5 yrs old (cheasy chrome job).  I'm 
thinking my carb is gummed up.  Going to slap on my dinky 30pic1.

Any advice on my gummy 34pict3?  I was told the screw on the side below the 
choke cover can be blowed out w/ compressed air.  This carb has never liked 
to idle!  If that screw hole is clogged will that make the bus jump?  I 
don't want to rebuild the carb as of yet.  Can I soak it w/o damaging the 
seals?  I'm tried carb cleaner in a can, no fix!  Any carb ideas are grately 
appreciated, as is any other spark/fuel trouble shoots.  I know if the gen 
ground on the shroud comes off it runs similar.  Could I have a grounded out 
wire causing all this?  Voltage regulator?  Been driving like this for 500 
miles w/ lights sometimes and the battery is golden!

Excuse the Rambling!

TIA and enjoy the wkend!
