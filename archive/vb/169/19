Well Yes, and no.  I have a lot of experience wrestling with the 009 and
34pict3 scenario, as this is the setup that was in my 71 when I got it and I
dinked with it for about 9 months before going back to a stock dual vac dizzy.
 When I got it, the bus ran great, but it idled VERY fast.  Turns out it idled
so fast because it was timed at about 7-10 BTDC, which is where the 009 should
be timed, but not the best scnario for the 34pict3.  Because when I adjusted
the carb to lower the idle, it created other problems, I could set the carb so
it would idle fine when engine was cold but then as soon as the engine warmed
up the idle stumbles or I could set the idle at warm engine temps but then it
wouldn't idle when cold.
Then I did Boston Bobs Procedure where I plugged the hole in the throttle
plate. After doing this, I could advance the timing up to 7-10 BTDC and I
could adjust the 34pict3 as normal.
  When my carb crapped out on me, I went ahead and and found a stock vac dizzy
from a swap meet and went that direction.  
FWIW.
