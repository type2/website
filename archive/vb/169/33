Subject: Sending unit

I am trying to repair the broken fuel gauge on my son's 66 bus. How does one
access the sending unit. I looked at one at a local body shop. There was a
hole in the back deck and the top of the unit was clearly visible. There is
no such hole in ours!? Was this an owners solution to reaching a difficult
place? I was going to try grounding the sending unit, but now do not know
how to get to it. Am I fixing(South Georgian) to cut me a hole?  Is there a
better way to access it, if it need replacing?
Thanks Ya'll
Tom
