The hole is a short cut BUT the other way is remove the motor and then 
remove the gas tank, Be very careful about cutting near the tank because 
of gas fumes. And seal the hole up good after (fumes). You did say 
broken fuel gauge but you think it is the sender.  You can do a visual 
inspection of the thin wires on each side of the sender, we did a bench 
test with an ohm meter and or the gauge. Just add power.
P & C

 I am trying to repair the broken fuel gauge on my son's 66 bus. How does one
access the sending unit.
