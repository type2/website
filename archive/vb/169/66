Well, my personal children never cried, or at least I have removed those
incidents from my memory.

Best thing we ever did was to buy each daughter a cassette player and
headphones of their own.  They have a box of tapes, and since each has a
player there's no argument about what is to be played.  Daddy is usually
up front listening to that horrible-sounding ham radio anyway.

Good music for children:
"Harmony Ranch" by Riders in the Sky
Disney movie soundtracks
"Peter and the Wolf" by Weird Al Yankovic and Wendy Carlos
Raffi (but not for grownups, after 20 minutes you'll need a diaper change)
Wee Sing (ditto)
Yellow Submarine by the Beatles
Marilyn Manson (just kidding)

George
