Subject: Still getting clutch noise mystery

I'm about to take my engine out for the third time in
a row.
First time, I pulled engine and tranny, had redux
boxes resealed and had the main flywheel seal
replaced. That's it.
I put everything back in and started getting a
whirring noise when I pressed the clutch in, in
neutral or any gear. No noise when the clutch pedal is
up.

The noise increases the further I push the pedal down.

I took the engine out, saw no signs of bent throwout
arm, nor any wear/rubbing on any housing or flywheel,
the pressure plate and disc are 3000 miles old and
still look fine. I replaced the throwout bearing. 

I put the engine back in and get the same noise.

What now?

Gotta remove engine again, but what should I look for?
The noise is like a rattling or light scraping, maybe
even with a tick which increases in tempo ewhen I rev
the engine with the clutch pedal down.

Help. I'm trying to avoid buying a whole clutch setup
and placing it in there then still getting the noise.
That would really suck.

Someone suggested the pilot bearing? How can I check
that? or a bent clutch disc?
