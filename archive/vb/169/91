Hi Chris,
Try softer shocks and differant tires, but leave the suspension alone since 
these two changes can be removed easily!  To soften the suspension will 
result in leaning way over to the point of flipping the bus in the corners 
especially on steep downhills, and sidewinds or semi trucks passing you will 
automaticly make you change lanes at highway speeds.  BTDT and were so much 
happier when we went to stiffer tires & shocks!  If you want waterbed like 
suspension get a 1950-70s Cadilac.
