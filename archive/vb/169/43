Hi Tom,
Best to remove the engine to get to it.  Cutting holes near the gas tank is 
dangerous and if there is ever an engine fire and the hole is not properly 
closed/sealed the fire gets into the interior all too faaast!  As an added 
bonus you two can install a 1968-71 bus gas tank for a fifteen instead of the 
early only ten gallon capacity tank.  Plus you two can replace flex fuel 
lines and secure the metal ones to prevent the dreaded fuel fire system for 
another two to three years, and check the tranny, clutch, and rear suspension 
out for maintaince.
