Hi George,
Duh!!  We should have remembered that the bushing sticks out into the 
bellhousing!  Additionally the machining of the length of that bushing and 
placement of the set bolt hole in it will affect the TO arm placement!  We 
have given up out of fustration on the new fangled metal and plastic bushings 
and only use the old fashioned solid bronze ones.
