Hi Jason,
There should be some side to side wiggle of the TO bearing to allow self 
centering, but we have found several arms with both aftermarket and NOS ones 
to have the arms way to far to the left or at least the inside bellhousing 
mounting C-clip to far to the right or perhaps worn too much where the C-clip 
seats against the left side of the bellhousing!  This required us to aquire a 
stock of thin washers to shim the TO fork to the right.  Some bending of the 
arms can be done to do the same, but at some point you end up raising the TO 
bearing out of center verticly.  So if it is more than .040" or 1mm out of 
center we shim it.

We use a 6" machinist ruler.  Though a short cut off section of a one foot 
ruler will work if it has at least 1/32" or 1mm markings on it.
  We have had some new TO bearings just make a slight whirring sound no 
matter what when the pedal is pressed, but it should not be LOUD.
  One last thing make sure that you have the clutch cable adjusted not too 
tightly or too loose.  Too tight and the bearing is constantly rotated by the 
clutch pressure plate, also if the TO retaining clips are loose the bearing 
will tilt to touch the clutch pressure plate!  This can also be caused by 
volks whom use the clutch pedal as a foot rest when driving.
