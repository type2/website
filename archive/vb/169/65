Subject: re:door resto

not sure if i missed what you are making your door panels out of? or are you
buying the repros?

just to let you know-i made mine out of some masonite type material, that
was coated on one side with some white enamel type stuff-i think it is
basically a cheap shower liner. so it is pretty water resistant. anyway i
put the white side towards teh inside of the door, then spray painted the
side you see with some textured grey enamel-i think it is supposed to look
like cast metal. anyway it adds texture to the paint, so the panel doesn't
look so flat.

i also taped some heavy duty plastic liner to the panel. this works ok-but
every now and then water gets onto the floor. i would suggest following the
others advice, and attaching the plastic to the door, and tuck the bottom
into the door-but not too much plastic or you might end up trapping water in
the door.

keep your drain holes clear.
