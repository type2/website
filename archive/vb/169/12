Subject: 1964 white over green microbus trying to post to list

Hello,
I think I have finally figured out how to post to this list...???

Linda & Bob
1964 white over green microbus in Auburn,WA
P.S. Just got back from maiden voyage down the Oregon coast to Jedediah
Smith State Park in California...saw the redwoods and buzzed back up the
coast then over to I5...not a single hint of a problem...except for the red
light coming on a couple of times while driving at night.
