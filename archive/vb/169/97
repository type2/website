VWonderful--

In my splittie with a 1776, 009, and a 34 pict 3 carb, and electronic
ignition, I run a 130 main jet, never a stall-- --Everything works just
great--TWWM, uj

Hey all.  My starter just burnt out.  It was a 6 volt starter and I recently
went to 12 volt w/ alternator.  I am going to put a 12 volt  in for a
replacement, but I am worried about the other 6 volt items that may go,
wiper motor for one.  Did my 12 volt system fry my 6 volt starter?  It made
a really bad noise and I could smell it burning.

I have also been having a problem w/ my 34 pict 3 carb and my 009.  I
frequently stall at idle.  Will putting a pop rivet in the butterfly cure
that?

Maybe my frequent stalling and starting killed my starter?
