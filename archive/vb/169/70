Hi Jason,
Sounds brillant to us!  ;-)  Just remember if things are incorrect in there 
it will not take many shifts to show any wear.

Good, but if you have any doubt you can with the engine out measure the FW 
pressure plate to engine flange that the tranny bellhousing seats against 
distance and then measure the TO bearing surface the pressure plate touches 
(near to one of the pivot points not top or bottom where it will scew the 
measurement with TO bearing tilt.) to bellhousing flange where the engine 
case seats against.  The TO bearing to tranny bellhousing measurement should 
be about 1/8" more.  This means the TO bearing is not touching the FW presure 
plate and wearing out and not too far away causing the clutch not to 
dissengage fully damaging the syncros and tranny gears over time.  This 
measurement is a good way to set the clutch cable with the engine out after 
replacing clutch components.  Saves alot of time under the bus getting dirty 
and tired arm!

We have a friend who is slightly taller than Eric, but when sitting it turns 
out he is even a bit taller!  We cut out one full turn of each seat spring so 
he could sit lower in his 1965 bus with the seperate driver seat.  It has 
helped him and it looks like we could have removed another turn of each 
spring for him.
