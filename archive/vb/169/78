Subject: Front Suspension softening.

Hi,

I have been wanting a softer ride in my bus and thought that removing one of
the leaves from either the upper or lower torsion bar might assist in this
endeaver. Additoinally I would want to add one of those screw type gadgets
for lowering/raising the front end to allow me to reset the height back to
normal. Anyone have thoughts on this or tried something like it?

Dave W. I read your post.
