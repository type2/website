Subject: 6volt Starter Life Span and Carb Problem

Hey all.  My starter just burnt out.  It was a 6 volt starter and I recently 
went to 12 volt w/ alternator.  I am going to put a 12 volt  in for a 
replacement, but I am worried about the other 6 volt items that may go, 
wiper motor for one.  Did my 12 volt system fry my 6 volt starter?  It made 
a really bad noise and I could smell it burning.

I have also been having a problem w/ my 34 pict 3 carb and my 009.  I 
frequently stall at idle.  Will putting a pop rivet in the butterfly cure 
that?

Maybe my frequent stalling and starting killed my starter?
