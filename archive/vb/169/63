Also, you can have the left hand snap ring come out of its groove,
allowing the shaft to move to the left.  It only takes a few mm to make a
heck of a noise. The return spring will keep the shaft from moving too
far, which hides the problem to external inspection.

I safety-wire this snap ring to make sure that it stays tightly in the
groove.
