I ordered a set of jailbars for the back rear seat three weeks ago 
and haven't heard a peep. I've emailed them twice, once last week and 
the week before asking if they got my order and my credit card 
payment, but I get nothing - silence.

Anyone know if they are out of business or is this SOP for them?
TIA,
