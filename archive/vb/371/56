Engine specs:
1776cc
counterbalanced crank
8:1 CR
009 dizzy
Extractor exhaust with quiet pack muffler.
rebuilt trans with 3.875 R&P, new trans mounts. Standard big nut RGB's.

I had originally assumed that the noise was the exhaust note, but I tried 
another muffler and then I got one from a Saturn. I figured that GM had 
spent a good bit of time perfecting that one for a 4 cylinder engine. No 
dice. The drone persisted.

There was a lot of other higher frequency stuff other than the basic 120hz 
vibration. I need to add a low pass filter. When I get my LabView equipment 
I will be able to do a pretty fancy set up with software filters, FFT etc.

As I said in an earlier post, previous 1600 cc with stock cranks gave 
similar results. I am now thinking that the trans mounts etc. are 
contributing.

Maybe if I add rear engine mounts as is on a Bay I can stiffen up the 
assembly so that it won't resonate.

Anyone have a spare rear engine mount?
I am in the Los Angeles area.

Hey Chris,

Nice work!  Just out of curiosity, do you see 'peaklets' due to the
ignition and exhaust impulses?   I'll bet you a donut that what you
are hearing is due to resonance in the stock muffler.
