And  stiffer is what I need to get rid of the vibration at freeway speed.  
Anyway, I don't think I will go that route. I am more interested in trying  a 
rear engine mount as in a bay. <<



Hi Chris,
Actually no.  If that was so you could just build all steel  mounts.  The 
stiffer the more noise gets to the body  and interior.  Would suggest dropping 
cruising RPM to  3,000.  If then quite keep that as a cruising RPM.  If you want 
to go  faster get a Freeway Flier tranny to help keep RPMs down, but allow 
more  MPH.
  Beware, sound insulating pads can hold moisture and promote  rust.
