Subject: Re: [VB] Front Seat adjustment...

I just bought a 65 and am finding that I'm a bit tall for the OEM split bench
(I'm 6'2" with a long back) so I find myself slouching to see the traffic
lights etc.  I hope that I can mitigate this, perhaps with a modified, lower
profile seat bottom with a product such as "temperfoam" as the seat padding in
place of the springs to retain a stock look.

Another annoyance (for me as a new splittie-owner) is the windshield
wipers...they do not wipe through my line of sight.  The arms look quire
stubby and maybe they have been replaced with a substitute in the past, and
the upper quarter of the windscreen isn't getting swept, which is a good
couple of inches below my line of sight :(  The blades can't be any longer
with the current geometry...is this normal?

Regards,

Drew
