Back in  the 50's when those huge metal visors were stylish, they made a 
plastic gizmo  that sat on the dashboard. It had slots in it to reflect the

light.



Hi Jeff,
We have been looking for one of those or the proper name to be able to find  
someplace that sells them.  Had not thought before of using a convex  mirror 
on the dash......
