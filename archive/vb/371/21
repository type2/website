Subject: wiper arm recall

After reading the post on the wiper arm recall I'm
looking to replace the wiper arms on my 67 Westy.  I
would like to put the style arms on that clamp on to
the shaft with a bolt instead of the set screw style. 
Does any one know where to get this style wiper arm? 
I've seen a reference to Jeep but nothing specific. 
I'm not concerned with stock original stuff.  This is
my only vehicle, a daily driver.  Thanks for the help.
