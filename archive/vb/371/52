Howdy all you science and physics guys.

Here is some hard data on the droaning moaning noise.
A sensor sync's my scope the the engine rotation at roughly TDC.
An accelerometer is mounted to the driver side of the fan shroud about 2" 
above the shroud mounting screw. The axis of the accelerometer is horizontal 
across the engine. It is mounted fairly hard with a sheet metal screw.

At about about 3600 rpm as shown on my scope, my accelerometer shows a 
vibration of about 180hz. That is about 3 times the engine rotation speed of 
60 rps. The vibration only grows above about 3000 rpm.   The vibration is 
synchronized with the engine rotation. The frequency goes up as the engine 
speed goes up. Nothing much showing from the fan itself. I did remove the 
fan belt for a short run. It must be well balanced.

The noise above 3000 rpm would be consistent with what I am hearing. At 
55-60 the noise is not bad, above 60 it starts to grow

If it was an engine out of balance, I would expect see the vibration 
synch'ed to the rotational speed. However the vibration is at around 3x the 
rotation speed.

Any ideas as to identifying the culprit?

Maybe I need to trade rides on the freeway with someone else just to get a 
comparison of the sounds and noise levels.
