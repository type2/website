Subject: Re: [VB] Towing a bus

I have used my bus tow bar at least 20 times on maybe 15 different buses.  It 
does great. Not sure on state laws. I know in VA it's legal. I have 2  lights 
that I run on the back of the tow bus hooked to my plug with "IN TOW" on  the 
back glass. I use a 91 ECO Jetta diesel to tow with and the buses tow behind  
it very good. Got the tow bar from Jeremy Hoggard in Glen Allen VA. Need his  
info email me.
