That's weird.  In South Carolina that means the bus is sold, period.

I can tell you exactly what the buyer in SC thinks of that.  That is putting 
people through a lot of unnecessary horseshit (i.e., putting in for leave, 
borrowing a trailer, aranging lodgings with relatives in Pennsylvania, 
ect.)for reasons I cannot fathom.  In other words, there is no buyer in SC 
anymore.
If in your planned travels you happen to find yourself down my way, feel 
free to drop by, I'd love to have a little chat.
