Subject: new battery cable

Well I'm planning on some quality time with my bus next week...

I have been thinking of replacing the cable from the starter to the battery.
I'm going to pick up some welding cable-sounds like pretty nice stuff(very
flexible, conducts well). There is a welding supply place near here that
says they sell it by the foot. As per Matt's recommendations I was going to
get the 2/0 gauge. Welding cable should be a lot more flexible than the
battery cable. I imagine 5' of the stuff should be plenty.

I'm also going to see if they sell the battery clamps, I'll try to get the
kind that you solder on. If they don't carry them-who does? Would my FLAPS,
like aut*z*ne carry something like this, and if they do what's the quality
like? I know I could find it on the net, but I prefer shopping locally
first.

Thanks...
