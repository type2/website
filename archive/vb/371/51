Subject: re:new battery cable

I went with this option, but why they nyloc nut and washer, instead of the
wing nut it comes with? Is this to prevent it from wiggling loose?

Also why did your email show up as coming from me on the vintagebus digest?

Was writ by matt:

You have a couple of options besides online ordering if the above doesn't
pan out.  You can put a lug on _both_ ends of the battery cable.  Your FLAPS
will sell a battery terminal clamp that has a stud and wing nut on it.  Put
your lug over the stud and replace the wing nut with a nyloc nut and a
washer and it's a reasonable battery terminal.  Note that some of these have
a small raised area of lead around the stud - see how much contact you're
actually getting between the lead and the lug.  If it's not much, you might
sand or file down the lead to provide a wide, flat surface for the lug to
sit on.
