Subject: Wiper Stuff

I converted Rosie's wiper arms to use the Bug (hook) style blades which are:

1.)much cheaper
2.)more readily available
3.)more effective

than original bus blades.

No, it's not stock, but if you are more concerned about having functioning
wipers than keeping that stock look, it's the way to go.

I cut the ends off some bug arms and heli-arc welded them onto the bus arms,
after measuring and determining the right length to get to the top of the
windshield.

They work really well and I can buy blades almost anywhere. Now I have to
decide how to get rid of the funky voltage reducer and get a real 12 volt
wiper system.

I have a '67 wiper motor assy, not wild about beating up the defroster vent
to make it fit, but I like the two speed option. Can also buy a 12 volt
armature for the existing motor from someone in Germany or the '67-'68 bug
motor thing previously mentioned.

What to do, what to do?
