I replaced the driver's side of my '63 DC's 1/3, 2/3 with a seat from a 
914. Stiff fiberglass with a minimum of padding. Used some of that 
no-slip stuff to keep if from sliding around and a seat belt to keep me 
and the seat on the bus. The Westfailure has the same setup with some 
kind of hinge setup. Low seat and high back worked for me for a several 
years of daily driving in town. Kind of uncomfortable for long range 
driving or rough roads. I'm 6'2" and could almost see the horizon from 
the lower seat. Never installed the sun visors!
