Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Front Seat adjustment...

If the seat has been reupolstered it can make a huge difference for a tall 
person, seems like many upolstery shops tend to over stuff the seats. I'm 
over 6 feet(and none too skinny on top of it) and I drive a 57 bus daily 
with no issues. The first time I sat in a fixed bench bus I just plain 
didn't fit, but later when i found my first 57 with og upolstery front seat, 
i realized it was because the seat was so puffy in the first bus. I'm closer 
to the wheel than in a later bus, but i haven't had any issues and my 
commute to work is a bit over 30 miles one way.
    I've also seen a drivers seat that was modified a bit by a taller owner, 
it was a 66 or 67 and they had removed the stock seat back and attached a 
piece of foam coverd with vinyl directly to the bulkhead to gain a little 
more space.
