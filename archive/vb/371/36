Subject: Re: [VB] new battery cable

Kevin,
   I suggest recyling a German battery cable from a mid-80's BMW. Some models had the battery in the trunk with an 11 foot postive battery cable that has a half inch diameter of stranded copper. I've got about a dozen of 'em for EV and other projects. I could ship you one for the price of a good six pack of beer. 
   If you find one in a salvage yard locally make sure the battery end is clean and uncorroded. Unbolt the front end from the firewall and push the big oval rubber grommet into the fenderwell with a BFscrewdriver. Remove the glove box and kick panel, pull the door seal to peel back the carpeting. If you don't need 11', cut it near the glove box and pull it out of the trunk. Otherwise you have to unsnake the front end that looks like a battery post through the body. It's a pretty nice part, not as flexible as welding cable, but the same amount of copper and you won't have to stake it down as much.
