Subject: Re: [VB] wiper arm recall

Hi John -
 As I previously noted to the list, VW has discontinued providing this style
of wiper arm, in fact several years ago. I have some inquiries into Europe
for any old stocks laying around, but have turned up zilch so far. I will
keep looking.
 There was a Brazilian variety available up until last year, but that was
discontinued as well.
 VW PN is 221 955 407 A Note - the original style arm as well as the
"recall" arm has the same part number - VW never superseded it, which is the
exception, rather than the rule.
