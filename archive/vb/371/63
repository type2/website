Subject: Re: [VB] Urethane tranee mounts

Thanks Jim,

Noise is what I am trying to eliminate. If you see my earlier posts 
regarding Science. I have an engine that vibrates at about 3600 rpm. I would 
like to see if I can move that up to around 4000+ rpm. For that I need 
stiffer mounts. Anyone out there added a rear engine mount onto a split as 
is on a bay?
