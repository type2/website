Subject: Panel or not, that is the question?

I just got a 63 panel or so I think it is. The bus has cut outs along the sides where it looks like there used to be windows. Did the VW factory weld up and then put body filler over where there were cut outs for windows. The left side of the bus has cargo doors and the cut outs are filled and so is the cut out just to the rear of the cargo doors. On the right side the cargo doors, yes it has cargo doors on both sides, both have had the window cut outs filled but on the right there was no cut out for a window behind the cargo doors. This bus does have the divider with the window behind the cab. On the M plate just below the gas tank the VIN# 1071349. Any clues as to the real identity of this bus.
