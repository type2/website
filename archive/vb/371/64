Oh, I can answer that one. I share a shop courtesy of Camelot Plastics
here in Red Bluff. He is a urethane manufacturer and a VW club member.
He repops antique car motor mounts on a one-off basis for customers.
Urethane is very hard and gives a stiff feel, almost like direct metal
to metal. But it is also more durable than rubber.
