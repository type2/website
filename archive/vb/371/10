Thanks for the wiper tips everyone.  I'll look for 67 bus or 68 Gia wiper
arms.

Regards,
Drew

Victoria, B.C.
'77 Hi-Top bay-window (for sale)
'66 Bowers Fly Baby 1a
'65 Standard (new owner!!!)

PS: If there is anyone in south-western BC who has a roof-rack and ladder for
sale I'm currently looking, looks not and issue as my bus isn't a show
vehicle.
