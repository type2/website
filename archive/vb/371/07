I have a  '67 wiper motor assy, not wild about beating up the defroster vent
to make  it fit, but I like the two speed option.


Hi Craig,

We tried the 6 volt wiper motor on 12 volt system and it is nice to have  the 
extra speed on occasion, but they burnt out too soon.  If one lived and  only 
traveled in the desert....
  Been thinking of installing a two way rocker switch mounted and  hidden 
just forward and up by the wiper switch in front of the dash.  This  rocker 
switch could be wired through the normal voltage drop we now use to  keep voltage 
down to about 7 volts, or a second voltage drop that would  keep voltage to the 
wiper motor to about 9 volts.  That would give us two  speed wiper motor and 
not burn it out.  VW generator, starter and other  motors are max rated for 
50% more voltage.
