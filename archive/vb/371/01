JD,

I know what you mean.  I am 6' 2" and drove a 1960 DC
for about 3 years.  My knees were against the dash but
what i found the most uncomfortable was if i sat up my
line of sight was above the top of the windows.  I
ended up hunching over while driving which
interestingly enough gave me more knee room.

I bought a 61 DC which has the 3 position adjustable
hump back front bench seat and it seams to have a
little more room yet still has that early bus look. 
My 65 Samba has way more knee room and i sit a little
lower but my line of sight is still above the glass if
i sit up.  The price i pay...

Matthew
