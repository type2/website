 In regards to the arm length, he mail have been refering to to Base size.
 The "recall" arms had a larger base which was taller, but the arm was the
 same length. As to windering how many VOA has left in stock, the answer is 
a
 big fat none. VOA discontinued the p/n several years ago. There was a black
 Brazilian variety available (not bad construction either) until recently
 when it was obsoleted too.
