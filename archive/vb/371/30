Subject: Moaning noise.

Hi,

What is the droaning moaning noise heard when driving at 65-70 (3500-4000+ 
rpm)? Is there a resonance in the engine? I have had this noise on 3 engines 
so far. The current one has a counterbalanced crank.
Anyone know?
I know that Bernie Bergman sells a steel pulley and claims it damps out 
something.

Thanks,
Chris
