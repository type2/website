Subject: Re: [VB] Moaning noise.

Same bus, 64 DD, 2 tranees. The noise is present when reving the engine in 
the driveway too.

One possibility is that the belly pan (not present in non DD's) is 
resonating. Rapping the pan produces a noise somewhat reminiscent of I am 
hearing. I am planning to add some Q-pads this weekend.
