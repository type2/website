On the note regarding angle, when I was first getting one working, a few 
summers ago (you know, get it working before the cold hits!), it didn't seem 
to matter what angle I held the heater at, it all seemed to work like 
normal. No changes in performance at all. At that time I also started 
playing with the ignition vs. fuel system to see what worst case scenario's 
I could get regarding saftey. I tried running it without one part of the 
system then introducing it back in to see what would happen. The most I 
could get was a big sooty "poooof!" out the tailpipe if I removed spark for 
a while and then introduced it again. Occasionally I could get a "pop" sound 
(like a small backfire sound) out of it while cycling it.

Put fresh fuel lines on them, and they are actually a very safe form of heat 
IMHO as long as the stainless steel burner chamber isn't damaged.
