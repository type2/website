Karl -
 In regards to the arm length, he mail have been refering to to Base size.
The "recall" arms had a larger base which was taller, but the arm was the
same length. As to windering how many VOA has left in stock, the answer is a
big fat none. VOA discontinued the p/n several years ago. There was a black
Brazilian variety available (not bad construction either) until recently
when it was obsoleted too.
 The 68 Ghia arms dogsbody is refering to are actually "hook" type arms that
fit 67-69 K Ghias. In might be further mentioned that if this option is
followed, use only the Left Ghia Wiper Arm as this is "straight". The Right
Ghia Wiper Arm is bent about 8 to 10 degrees at the end so that the wiper
blade would be horizontal when parked on a Ghia windshield. Excellent repros
of the arms (left) are available, but at a rather pricey $31.50 each.
