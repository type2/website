Subject: Re: [VB] Stewart Warner gas heater

The bug heater sat on the fire wall in the bug which was at an angle. 
If you fabbed up some sort of a box or bracket to mount inside the 
bus, maybe behind the driver, be sure to make the bracket at the same 
angle so the combustion chamber on the heater will sit level.

I know some of you will say "I would never put a gas heater inside 
the passenger compartment" but I would offer up this:  I have been 
around gas heaters since the 70's and have never seen one which 
caught on fire by itself.  I have on the other hand seen many VW's 
which spontaneously combusted.

Stewart Warner has built hundreds of thousands of gas heaters and has 
put them in everything from tanks to aircraft.  If you every get to 
look inside a WWII B17 bomber, you will see 2 South Wind heaters, one 
for the pilots and front gunner and one for the rear gunners which 
are almost identical to the ones put in VW's.

And yes, I do have new and used parts for all models of the VW South 
Wind heaters.
