Subject: Re: [VB] Urethane tranee mounts

  I personally would never use urethane mounts on a bus. The ones that seem to be available are OK but after time 
they compress and the bolts get loose. If you have a vibration there is something else wrong. 
   The biggest cause of vibration I have seen in VW engines as of late is the Brazilian pressure plate. These DO NOT 
alaign properly due to the way they are manufactured and cause a vibration  throwing the flywheel clutch assemble 
out of balance.
   I distroyed a perfectley good 1776 in one of my buses in 3000 miles. Totally wiped out the thrust bearing, oblonging 
the case.
