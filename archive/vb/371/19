Subject: Towing a bus

Hi all,
   
  I'm thinking of purchasing a 1966 bus.  Due to insurance reasons (need an appraisal in Ontario for insurance, so bus must be in Ontario first) I have to tow a perfectly good bus.  A dolly is out of the question due to hitch requirements.  All mechanical on bus is in excellent shape.  Any one have any experiences with using a tow bar to tow a bus?  Good, bad experiences?  Legal requirments in the states (specifically east coast)?  Any help would be appreciated before I set off on a road trip.
  
Thanks,
   
  Jim.
