Thanks George, I know that it may only just lower the resonant frequency(at 
least it will in theory).



 It _might_ damp out torsional vibrations in the crank.  OTOH,
 it might actually increase it, depending upon the crank, flywheel, and
pulley combination.  I wouldn't go there unless you have the capability of
 doing torsional testing on the whole assembly.
