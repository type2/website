Tom-
It came to my attention that you are a novice
and it often happens that advice is sought to
resolve a problem which can be resolved by
basic maintenance. However, once the problem
is resolved, the maintenance schedule is often ignored.

Brakes are not trivial. Yours are unknown. I haven't
looked at them, and you need to. Putting off an
important safety issue for any reason ( *lack of time )
is not a good idea. Perhaps you should consider
not driving the bus until the maintenance is done.
Advertising that you have defective brakes on the
internet would be very damaging in a civil lawsuit
should an accident occur for which you are liable.
