Subject: RE: [VB] Dual vs single vacuum advance

You got that right John. The vac parts for the 205 series distributors are
getting real pricey. That's why most of us scour the used parts to find as
many as we can. A very good replacement is the Bosche SVDA :
Bosch SVDA (SDDA) Distributor, with vacuum advance
Part #: IGD0001   Price: $ 119.95
This is recommended unit for Dual Port engines when using a 34 PICT
carburetor or the Weber progressive. It gives you advance curves that go
from mild 205's to above .050 and is a fairly bulletproof distributor. Works
with the .050 dual point plate and Pertronix Igniters.

I've been told the dual vacuum holds it back at idle, in effect giving
more advance off the line.  Then again some folks say just plug the retard
side or disconnect it.  I've used them and they worked fine.  The drawback
is that if you need to replace the vacuum can it costs about twice as much
as the single one as I recall.
