you know a regular type I doghouse cooler?   The cooler has a base that 
attaches to the engine case, then the cooler itself attaches to the bases (so 
you need 4 seals).  If you take a cooler from a type IV engine, it bolts to 
the base exactly the same, and the cooler is a bit thicker.  more cooling 
fins.  you modify the doghouse fanshroud so it fits the bigger dog, and I 
think also one of the vent tins and the 'hoover bit'.

I found that this brought down oil temps 5 to 10 * C
.
Re 25/36 hp pulleys- the 25hp is differnt than a 36hp pulley.  It is bigger 
and flimsier and you dont want to use it as it is too easy to warp.   Leave 
it for the 25hp engines & vintage nerds.


Any one ever compare the type III cooler to the type I doghouse?  I'd heard 
the more fins thing for a while, but anyone ever swap between with guages and 
see actually temps?  Ronnie?
