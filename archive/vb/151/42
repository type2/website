Subject: Marvel mystery oil- motors that sat years- white smoking exhaust


I just fired up a motor that sat 12 years last night, after fuddling
with the fuel injection (D jetronic). When I pulled plugs, I pumped in
cyls with a spare gear oil pump, a ton of Marvel oil (trying to be nice
to rings). Then I turned by hand a couple trillion times.
Then with starter. Then plugs. Then I finally got fuel injectors that
work, old ones stuck shut.
Engine smokes white, pur white, real badly. Shut her down after 3-5
minutes.
My question is the smoke form the huge amount of marvel in those cyls?
About how long should I expect this to burn off in? The smoke is not in
any way blue or black, looks like a watercooled burning up antifreeze
almost, but less dense white.
TIA,
AL
