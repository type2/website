Subject: Front Beam Identification

Just picked up a '60 Single Cab.  My first Splitty!  I'm trying to =
figure this thing out.  It's a bit of a hodge podge of different years.  =
I was told the front beam was from a '67?  From checking various parts =
vendors lists I can see there is a difference in beams from '64 and up?  =
I need to order a few things and wanted to verify that I have a '67 =
beam.  Here's a pic from the torsion arm/drum area (you may have to =
cut&paste)...

What changed in '64 and is there anything I can look for to identify it? =
 Front backing plates/spindles/drums different?  Any info at all would =
be a great help!
