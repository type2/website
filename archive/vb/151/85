Subject: Hupp gas heaters

I cannot remember if I asked this before and I don't see anything in the
archives so...

Does anyone have any information - repair books, brochures, parts, etc.
on Hupp gas heaters?  I have a Hupp Perfection that I need to work on. 
I think it works except for the fuel pump.

Thanks,
Everett Barnes
