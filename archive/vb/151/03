I've been told the dual vacuum holds it back at idle, in effect giving
more advance off the line.  Then again some folks say just plug the retard
side or disconnect it.  I've used them and they worked fine.  The drawback
is that if you need to replace the vacuum can it costs about twice as much
as the single one as I recall.
