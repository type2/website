Subject: New Center pin

I'm attempting to replace the center pin on my 60 double cab and I'm
stumped.  There is that wavey washer that goes under the cap with the rubber
seals and then the L arm goes on but I can't figure out how to compress the
whole thing to get the bolt that holds the L arm on lined up with the notch
on the center pin?  I've tried prying it down with no success.  Is there a
special tool out there?  Should I get a large C clamp?  I hope I'm making
sense to those that have done this before.

Help me Obi One.
