I've been having great success with cleaning both mating surfaces
immaculately, then applying a thin coat of Permatex Ultra-Grey Hi-Temp
Silicone to each surface and mating. Setting time, about 20 minutes - try
and get them together within five minutes, 15 minutes max. Be sure to
apply it around all bolts and bolt holes. I've also used it for years to
seal everywhere in the engine, except the mating of the block, where I
use Permatex 3-H Aviation sealer.
