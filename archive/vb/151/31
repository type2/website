Location: My oil cooler, which, believe it or not, I bought back in the
70's from RVEECO in Berkeley, when they were still around, has been
hanging horizontally under the engine, held there by long hose clamps
around the front halves of the heater boxes, for over 28 years. It's
mounted so that the rear fins are just forward (F is F) of the oil drain
plug.. Of course, I have to loosen and remove the clamps and cooler when
getting ready to r and r the engine, but the 25 to 30 degree reduction in
oil temp makes it worth it.

Ten years ago, I replaced the problematic neoprene lines with stainless
steel webbed teflon oil lines with AN-8  fittings, during the 1991 engine
overhaul. At that time, the new block was equipped with the Gene Berg
modified oil pump and gallery blocker thingee in the case, which is the
same way that RVEECO had done it several engine cases ago.

Also in that rebuild, I added the O-Berg full-flow oil
filter with cleanable/replaceable element, and the teflon/SS oil lines,
after the cooler.

Been using this arrangement for about ten years, wouldn't be without it.
