This is very effective, I have done the same for miscellaneous gaskets over
the years.

What do you all use for "impregnated" gasket material?  I think you can go
to the auto store and get paper that is treated with wax or plastic
something so gaskets will not leak.   A great example would be for the oil
screen gaskets which suck in pure paper form.

As for some items, and I think the RGBs as well, a good coating of Permatex
Aviation gasket sealer may do the trick w/o a paper gasket (the stock gasket
is thin to begin with).

As a side note I have been playing with Gas-a-cinch (sp) stuff and I am not
impressed.  The applicator ball is too big and messy and the sealant is too
thin when it applies to stay still (read: runs).  It may be good for some
stuff, but I will not be buying another can (granted the 8 ounces I have now
will probably last years anyway).  I will stick with the Permatex Aviation
gasket sealer since I know it works like a champ.  Also the Copper Coat
stuff is very good and I have been using it a little more lately in high
temp spots, good stuff. 

Enough ramble from me :)
