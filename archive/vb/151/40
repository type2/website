Hi Paul,
I have the same problem on my 67 Sundial, and I got all of my rubber from
Wolfsburg West here in California.

Don't know about a solution, but it's really a double-edged sword, since my
windows seal so well, at least they don't leak.  I'd be interested in a
solution to finding the balance here as well.
