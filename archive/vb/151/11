3DPete-
A call from the mechanic with confusing information requires
a visit on your part to examine the damage.
.
Perhaps your # 1 bearing is not " welded to the case ".
As you know you have never run the engine without oil, then
it's reasonable to request another damage diagnosis with
other possible causes. Not so much as to place, or mitigate
liability on either part, but to get to the root cause in order to
not repeat it.
It would be good to know if the case was line-bored
( all the bearings are stamped for oversize on the back ).
The # 1 bearing might also be specially made to repair thrust surface.
The case can be measured to determine if the line-bore was accurate.
" 5000 miles since a rebuild"- is not enough time for mains to go bad
without a good reason. It would be good to know if # 1 main spun
in the case, and what happened to the dowel pin. If this happened,
i would suspect trouble with the endplay measurement or line-bore.
( measurement of all case mains, even for standard bearings , is important ).
The mains must be firmly clamped to support the crank and deliver oil.

Ba sure to mention what oil you are using.
As for the balanced engine vibration, remember you are using dual 34's
and it is very easy for carbs to cause that condition.
Determine what parts of value are left to consider a rebuild.
Examine the balance work on the crank, rods, and p/c , if any.
Have the crank checked by a machinist for potential use.
List help is available if you can get a better description of the problem.
