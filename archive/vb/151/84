Hi Duff,
No problem, we will just send this to the list!

Sounds like a badly machined center pin!  Take out the warpy washer and see 
how far off the bolt notch is off.  Measure just the thickness of the warpy 
washer not its warp.  Add this washer thickness to the first measurement.  If 
this equals out then flatten the washer some, if still too short you need a 
new center pin.

Even NOS can be bad!
