Hi Ray,
Sounds good!  We have used tempered pieces of safety glass like wing windows 
or popouts for this same sanding proceedure.  Making sure to rotate the 
plate/object often to help prevent sanding one side more than the other.   
First though we use a ball peen hammer and some type object used as an anvil 
to take out the worse of the hills in the metal caused by overtorquing and 
save alot of sanding time.
