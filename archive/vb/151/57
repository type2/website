I believe that 67s have rear seat belt anchors installed from the factory.  
Find the big plastic phillips screw looking things  back there by the engine 
hump, unscrew them and attach yr seat belts.

um, but if yours was made from a panel, no stock seat belt points in the back.

when I put belts in the front of my 61 I drilled holes, and as a 
reinforcement under I used old tosion bars, which are strong and supple, and 
a real PITA to drill holes through.    The idea is to spread the load in case 
of accident, look under the front of you bus and see how the seat belt 
anchors are reinforced.
