hm, interesting- I haven't noticed any flattening.  Did you use a longish 2x4 
to spread the weight?   

there was some reason I found the rear tosion bar awkward, dont remember 
right now.   

Definately not a good idea to jack the rear of the bus up using the motor, as 
you say the engine is conected to the tranny, so the bus is hanging ff those 
tranny mounts.

 Hi Clara,
 We used to use that area.  Then we noticed we were flatting it out which 
 would weaken it.  Before that we even used the sump plate of the engine to 
do 
 the same and finally tore up the rear tranny rubber mounts.  Since then we 
 use only the torsion bar tubes for jacking our VWs with no problems.
