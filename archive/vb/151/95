Subject: 25 versus 36 Pulley

Clara writ:
>Re 25/36 hp pulleys- the 25hp is different than a 36hp pulley.  It is
bigger 
and flimsier and you don't want to use it as it is too easy to warp.   Leave

it for the 25hp engines & vintage nerds.<

I am fairly certain this is a 36 HP crank pulley.  From what I can tell the
25 HP had a riveted outer ring and some other oddities to it..?

This pulley I have is larger than the regular pulley but of the same general
construction.  Granted the 36HP pulley seems roughly 1/4"+ in diameter
bigger.

PS:  Someone please feel free to make an offer on this engine.  It turns
freely, with dizzy, fuel pump, flywheel, rods, cam, crank, crank pulley, and
all that stuff.  Not a doorstop by any means.  The generator stand is
unmolested.  I have a 6v generator to go with it, but is probably toast.  I
can provide vin numbers and such.  I would keep it, but I am out of storage
space and I cannot see myself ever running a 36HP engine.  No reasonable
offer refused, but you have to prove that you will use it (read: no
resellers or gar-bay freaks).

  
Thanks,
