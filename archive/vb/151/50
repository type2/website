This would seem logical.  The oil carries the frictional heat which would
go up with RPM.  the CHT reflects the combustion heat which would go up
with the amount of mixture burned.

This is why I'm leery of relying on additional oil cooling to lower
overall engine temperatures.

Porsche went to water-cooled heads once the cooling problems got out of
hand.  If they could have accomplished the same thing with the oil I bet
that they would have gone that way.
