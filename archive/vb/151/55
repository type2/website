Subject: Re: [VB] Hard to open pop outs

Do you have new outer scrapers?  The ones over here also stick the window 
closed.  I hear that in about a year they become easier to open.  If it isn't 
the seals, you can try adjusting the pop out latch, where it attaches to the 
pop out frame.

 solution to fix it.  Suggested have been window rubber lubricant (which I
 think contains silicone) or petroleum jelly, however other people have said
 not to use these as they damage paintwork.  Has anyone got any good ideas on
 how to make it easier.  It could just be the rubbers that are in normal
 supply over here just aren't very good and in the US you don't have the
 problem, if so I will have to try and get some!
