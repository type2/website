I wonder how much the CHT is affected by oil cooling?  The heads are
mostly air-cooled, obviously, and I wonder if lowering the oil temperature
by 20 degrees or so would affect the heads by more than a few degrees.

It seems to me that most damaging overheating is at the heads, as this is
what causes pulled studs.  Oil temp is an indirect indicator of what is
really happening at the heads, so I think that CHT is what should be
measured to get a real handle on the problem.

Also, I think that calibrations tend to vary quite a bit depending upon
the instrument you use and the exact location of the sender.  I think that
there would be a considerable difference in a CHT sender under the plug (a
very poor location, IMO, as it will be disturbed often) as opposed to a
sender at another head location.  The same applies to oil temp senders.
Some quick check showed that the sump temperatures on my bus varied by 40F
from the left front side of the sump to the right rear.

The problem with the variation in calibrations is that you cannot compare
readings from one engine to another.  Most folks instrument their engines
while installing some sort of cooling mod, so there is no previous data
with which to compare.  If you decide to go with the cooler, please record
some good data (constant set speed, level road, ambient temperature)
before making the mod so that you can get a good comparison.
