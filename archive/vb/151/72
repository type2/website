When my Dad and I fired up the engine in his Bug, we used some Marvel
in the cylinders and hand cranking first.  This was around 7 years ago,
but if I remember right, we did get some white smoke from the Marvel
burning off that took several minutes to dissipate.  That engine (a
1600 DP, carb) had sat for two or three years.

I'd say to make sure the crankcase is full of regular engine oil,
hook up a test light to the oil pressure switch (if the engine isn't
installed in a car), and run it some more.  If the light comes on,
shut it down, but otherwise it should be OK.  If you put really a
lot of Marvel in it, you may have pumped some into the exhaust, and
that will take a little longer to burn off. 

Good luck!
