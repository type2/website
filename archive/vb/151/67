Subject: re:hard to open pop-outs

Not sure if every latch is like this, as i only have one pop out window on
my bus...but you can adjust the location of the connection the bus-this is
probably to adjust the sealing properties. I try to tweak mine to get a
better seal, as mine leaks in rain storms...I have replaced all the seals to
no avail.
