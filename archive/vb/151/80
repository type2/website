Subject: RE: [VB] Big nut RGB bearings and gaskets

Eric & Barb & all,
I've found that an old chuck of thick glass, (about an inch), or any
surfaced stone that thick or thicker with a piece of wet/dry sand paper
works good to resurface something. I use a piece of quartz glass and 420
grit wet paper for sanding down my carburetor shells flat. I have used
similar methods for larger pieces. If a person could come up with a broken
chunk of pool table slate, that works good also. Goes hand in hand with
lapping in valves or cylinders.

Hi Adrian,
Hmm, those we have made in a pinch out of cereral box cardboard with no 
leaks.  Never needed special impregnated gasket material for oil areas, only

for fuel and exhaust areas.  The main thing about the sump plate is it has
to 
be flat especially around the stud holes where are often warped due to 
overtorquring.  Then when installed, torqued on not too much or too little.
