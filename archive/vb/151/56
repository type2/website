Good question. Who knows what alternator will work in a 1963 Porsche 356
S engine? Any suggestions on models that I could start researching to
see if they'd fit?

My understanding was that the small diameter (as opposed to the larger
diameter?) 912 generator was the only reasonable choice to go when
converting a 356 to 12V.

Well, if you're driving about with all systems ablaze you will overwhelm
a 30A generator

Supposedly, no. You will run your battery down.  However, if there is a
weak component in the generator or regulator you can overstress it to
failure.

I'm leery of "upgrades" of this type.  What happens a few years down the
road when your generator needs service and the company that modified it
is long gone?

Yes, they work together.

An alternator produces alternating current and uses diodes (one way
electrical valves) to convert the AC to DC to charge your battery.  A
generator uses a heavy-duty commutator to switch the current.
Alternators are lighter and, since the current comes from the outside
coils, there is no need to pass large currents through the commutator.

Question:  Why not use a late model VW alternator?  They're readily
available, very reliable, and will produce enough amperage to meet your
needs.  It may not be completely "stock appearing", but if you aren't
going to Pebble Beach the result might be just what you are looking for.
