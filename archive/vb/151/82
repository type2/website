Subject: RE: [VB] New Center pin

Thanks for the reply.  I'm not sure if I should include the whole list on
this or not.  Anyway... people may want to know.

>>both of the bushings pressed in far enough<<

I have made sure that both bushings are to the specification of the Bentley
manual.  I have also been told that I can hammer the wavey washer so it's
not so wavey.  That may help but I'm not sure if that's a good idea or not?
I've got about an 1/8th of an inch before the bolt will line up with the
notch.  Too much?

>>mismachined center pin<<

The center pin is brand new.

Thanks again!
Duff
