I measured this last using the infrared themp gauge and stopping after
hils and fairly open throttle highway driving on flats. 60 mph.
Oil temp increased to near 200 with rpms at 60+, and climping hills in 3
rd at 35 mph raised cyl head temps, without much affecting oil at
180-185.

I agree with your statements...

Has anyone seen better head tmeps with vac advance? I believe the curves
would allow for better advance, cooler heads, and better hill climbing
(I am hoping).
