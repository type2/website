Hi - I sent this to the Porsche 356, but I thought I'd try you guys too
since it's all the same...

Hoping someone might be able to provide some insight to an electrical
problem I've created for myself. Here's the background:

I just had my engine rebuilt by Jack Staggs (it's great!) and converted
the entire car to 12V at the same time. I used the small diameter 912
12V generator, new Optima battery, etc... pretty standard stuff... It
ran great and the battery charged fine for about 1000 miles, and then I
started messing with things. 

I added a stereo amplifier and upgraded my headlights to 55W/100W and
driving lights to 80W. I assumed that this would be too much for the
generator (which I believe is rated at 30 amps), but I thought I'd see
just how bad it is, and then upgrade once I had everything working.

Well, after about 50 miles of use, it seems I "overstressed" the
electrical system and something broke. The generator light is on and the
battery no longer charges. The belt/etc is still fine. So, my questions:

1. Can I (did I) damage components by trying to pull too many amps? I.e.
Can one "burn out" the generator by asking too much of it? I just
thought my headlights would be dim...

2. I found a company (Ace Alternator; http://www.acealternator.com/home)
that claims to be able to upgrade this generator to about 80 amps. Does
anyone have any experience with this?

3. If I upgrade the generator to higher output, do other components need
to be upgraded as well? Voltage regulator? Anything else?

4. (bonus question) I'm just curious, what's the difference between an
alternator and generator? What do I have? Everything 914 is
"alternator", everything 356 seems to be "generator".

Thanks for any tips!
