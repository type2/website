Hi Kevin,
Those are almost the same parts.  The only differances being the bus ones 
having the drain holes drilled in the chrome rings that make them left and 
right side parts.  Plus the inner ring for bug holds the lock ring and head 
light bulb 90 degrees turned differant from the bus horizontal.
