Subject: Seeking Brick bus photo

Recently I saw a photo of a misc. bay window bus on a for sale site that had a
brick and mortar paint job. Can anyone direct me to that location. For the fun
of it I'd like to have a copy.

A Landcruiser email list [yahoogroups.com/tlca.org] is currently discussing
"urban" camo paint schemas. This right up that (ahem) alley... ;-)
TIA,
- Ellis
