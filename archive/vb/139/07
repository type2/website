Subject:  Barn Door Questions


Greetings All,

I've got a few barndoor questions...

Will a later front end (55 - 62) bolt into a barn?
I guess the barn's heater pipe support panel gets in the way
as the barn beam's pivot is offset and not centered like the later beam?

Could you just bolt up the later 55-62 spindles onto the
barn beam (link pins are same size?)?  Any related problems with
mounting shock absorbers (obviously shocks are shorter
on the barney)?

Thanks

RobK
