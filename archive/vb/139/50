The switch definitely has two detents, then, right?  You can feel
it click into the first and second positions.

The two main possibilities are PO wiring creativity and a faulty
headlight switch.

>I feel like I've verified all of the wires to the correct point.

If you've checked the connections at the headlight switch, fuse
panel, and at the headlights and verified the wiring against the
wiring diagram for your year ( http://www.vintagebus.com/wiring ),
then it's probably in the headlight switch.  If you've isolated
it to the headlight switch, and you're resigned to replacing it
anyway, you _may_ be able to rebuild your switch, or at least
see what was wrong with it:

One interesting possibility is that someone had the switch apart
before and didn't get it back together correctly.  Do your dash
lights and tail lights come on in both switch positions?  Can
you dim the dash lights?  If any of these functions are not
working right, and the switch shows evidence previous repair
attempts, this could be the case.
