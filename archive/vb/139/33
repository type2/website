Subject: 2 1600s part deux

well, most listees (well, two) (which, actually is all, not most) voted for
rod knock on the GOOD 1600 (kinda what i thought :P), so i am taking it to
a friend's shop tomorrow to dismantle it.

the beater 1600 is in the van, and by god its running!  actually, it idles
smoother than the other motor  :)

it has MOST of a muffler, valve stems of various heights,  j-tubes, a 36hp
air cleaner, and the jets on the carb went up to 122.5/135z/60g before it
would stop backfiring at idle (and it still likes to backfire on
accelleration).  oil pressure is 60 psi at around 2500, and 15 or so at
idle. tin foil on the fan spouts. T3 tin and a few bits of bent T1 metal
attached to the case.
 now, if it backfires hard enough, it stops, so i'm under no illusions it
won't explode at any minute, but it was pretty fun to see how decrepit a
motor you can make run. this has been in the shed for 3 years.
it really just needs to make it to the shop and back tomorrow; otherwise, i
have to start up the 52-year-old-ch*vy pickup - which isn't a problem - and
put the good motor in its bed. which IS, as the 8-months pregnant wife has
been using that as a convenient excuse as why she can no longer help me
move things like, say, front beams around the yard.

as for synchronicity: a new berg price list showed up in the mail today.
hmmmmmm.... baby stuff, or a CW stroker crank and 88s?
