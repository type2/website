Hi Tom,
First check your guage and sender by dropping the sender still hooked up to 
the gauge into boiling water and try checking your RPM (-at-) 55MPH in fourth.
    Most likely you are well beyond the 3,000 RPM or a little less where the 
engine seems to cool most effiecently.  We can drive 59MPH (-at-) 3,000 RPM in 90F 
outside temp and keep the oil temp for most of the time well below 210F.  Due 
to using a freeway flier 3.875 R&P tranny with .82 fourth gear, 1964-67 
suspension and RGBs, type 4 cooler in doghouse shoud, with Porsche 2.75:1 
ratio upper pulley in a 1641cc SP CW cranked engine, all pushing a 1960 panel 
camper conversion, with camping gear, interior, three adults, and core engine 
parts that wieghed at least 20 Lbs..
