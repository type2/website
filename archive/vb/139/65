Yes this is true. Instead stuff gets stashed under the rear seat back to the gas tank divider wall.

I use a Westy rack or an early 1/2

Stock, same thing on the Single Cabs

> 4. Are safari windows any better than they were 10 yrs ago? When the repros came out, everyone complained about them cracking if you drive with them even slightly open.  Are there any good ones available today? When closed, is leaking a problem in the rain?

Yes, yes, and yes.

Doubtful
