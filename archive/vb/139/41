Here's something that i've done to help the cooling in my 64 bus =
(1600dp)
http://www.geocities.com/eaallred2/doghousemod.html

I welded two 1 7/8" tubes to the back of the doghouse tin, and blocked =
off
the bottom exit.  I also welded a tab on the inside to hold it in place =
on
the backside of the shroud.

I then run two hoses off the new doghouse fittings (same size as the =
hoses
that come off the doghouse for the heater), and exit the hot air down
underneat the engine.  I then remove the front piece of tin (front is =
front)
to allow more air into engine bay.  I run the stock tin that goes =
between
the case and heater boxes, to keep hot air from entering the new =
opening.

this mod gave me an extra 15 degrees of cooling on the freeway.
BUT, this mod isn't for you if you dont want to drill a couple holes in =
your
rear apron for the hoses to go through.  I figured, the apron would be
pretty easy to fix since it unbolts, and is a flat surface, if I found =
this
not to work.

works great for me.  :-)
