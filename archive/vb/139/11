well, my first rebuild is hitting the 5K mark, and i am beginning to wonder
if a newbie mistake somewhere isn't catching up with me...
1584 sp, all stock. ran great on our honeymoon trip (2k), but lately
started to make a 'clack'ing sound from the #4 cylinder/dizzy area; thought
it was a loose valve, but they hadn't budged since the last setting
(intakes: .004; exhausts: .006).
engine was also vibrating  a good deal, and pulling plug wires didn't seem
to make a difference; an examination of the plugs showed all were firing,
so it wasn't a dead cylinder.

Dunno, sounds like the classic rod bearing to me.
