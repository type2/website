Here's something that i've done to help the cooling in my 64 bus (1600dp)
http://www.geocities.com/eaallred2/doghousemod.html

I welded two 1 7/8" tubes to the back of the doghouse tin, and blocked off
the bottom exit.  I also welded a tab on the inside to hold it in place on
the backside of the shroud.

I then run two hoses off the new doghouse fittings (same size as the hoses
that come off the doghouse for the heater), and exit the hot air down
underneat the engine.  I then remove the front piece of tin (front is front)
to allow more air into engine bay.

Eric,
do you ever get exhaust into your cooling air/passenger compartment heat
while you are stopped? I wonder if exhaust can circulate underneath the
engine and then back into the engine compartment through the gap left by the
missing front tin?
