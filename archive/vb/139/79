Greetings All,

Would it be possible to charge a 6V battery
using a 12V charger on 'trickle' (1 amp) by using
a suitable resistor to drop the voltage in the
charge line (using something similar to the resistor used to
drop 12v for 6v wipers?)

Matt Roberts?

thanks

Rob, if you are planning on six volt trickle anyway, why don't you get a 6V
wall wart and a couple of clips? probably have one powering your speakers on
your computer. Or take the one off your kids Nintendo and send them outside
to play, heh heh.
