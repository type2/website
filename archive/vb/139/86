Subject: Re: [VB] '59 Single cab...bed is blasted!!!!

Ya, I banged out the dents in my '65 DC bed with a ball peen hammer. Works
great. A dent puller takes too long and only pulls in one area. Once you get
the dents to level within a 16th of an inch or so, you can use fiberglass
filler to smooth it flat. I put the filler over bare metal and then prime
and top coat.

The filler won't chip off unless you damage the paint film first.  Besides,
you don't want to abuse the bed that bad anyway. Thats how it got in that
condition.

: Yeh, mines not wavy thankfully. But those dents in the ridges. What
: did you do about those? I don't want to use filler 'cause I'm gonna
: actually use the truck. If I use filler it'll end up just chipping
: off. As it is now I was gonna give banging 'em out my best shot...but
: won't expect much. And then just leave the bed "rough". Other than
: welding in new metal...which I won't do....I can't figure anything
: else out.
