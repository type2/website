My wife is looking for a car to replace her trusty Beetle (which will go
into genteel retirement) and we're of a similar mind.  We looked at the PT
Cruiser, but the one we test-drove had two obvious defects (alternator
bearing squealing and a funny clunk and drop in the front end when going
around corners.  That and the slimiest "they all make that noise" salesman
soured us to the deal.

Seems that most folks who used to buy
VWs are now buying Hondas.  We looked at the CRV, but the new Element
coming out in November seems to have a lot of bus philosophy and utility
built into it.
