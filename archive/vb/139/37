BABY STUFF!!!! GET USED TO IT TOO!!!!

No really, I didn't know you were having a kid Craig. Congrats man! I 
guess she finally wore you down...or you made some kind of deal with

You'll enjoy it more than you know. You'll be a cool Dad too. One 
more free thinking youth in the world! They're gaining in numbers.....
