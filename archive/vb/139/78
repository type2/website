Subject:  charging 6v battery with 12v charger?


Greetings All,

Would it be possible to charge a 6V battery
using a 12V charger on 'trickle' (1 amp) by using
a suitable resistor to drop the voltage in the
charge line (using something similar to the resistor used to
drop 12v for 6v wipers?)

Matt Roberts?

thanks
