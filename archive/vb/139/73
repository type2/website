Looking for info here.  
1.Is it true that a double cab truck has no 'treasure chest' under the bed?
It appears the rear bench would be in the way, but did any years have a
small place to stash stuff?

**********************************************************
I can answer one question for the 65DC. Mine was nothing fancy and I
"assume" factory. Under the rear seat the compartment went all the way back
to the gas tank panel. How you can possibly retrieve anything from back
there if it slid all the way back is anyone's guess, but the tent fit in
there, then the poles. then my bag of stakes and small gas cook stove, in
that order. The kids thought it was a cool place to play till one of them
snagged themselves on a rusty chunk of metal. That was the end of that.
Anyway, I sold that truck 15 years ago and haven't been inside another DC
since to compare.
