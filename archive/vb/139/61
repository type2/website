Hi Russ,
The only thing you can do is to make sure both the front and rear shift 
linkage couplers are bolted tight and safety wired to make sure the bolts are 
kept tight (Yes, one can safety wire them in such a way as to loosen them!).  
Beyond that you can use a bungee to hold it in place, but the shifter parts 
inside the tranny will wear out faster due to this pressure on them, so best 
to have saved yesterday for a new tranny tomorrow!
