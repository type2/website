            I myself have a stud gun for those nasty little ridges.  There is 
another option, if you can dig up the tools.  Mac sells a neat little loop 
that replaces the normal thumb screw.  This little loop is for holding doors 
and trunks open when you work on them.  But the loop can also be used as a 
place to hook up a slide hammer.  Weld a tab of scrape metal to your dent.  
Clamp on with the vise grips and get physical with the slide hammer, being 
sure to stress relive the outside of the dent as it comes up.
              A few words about the slide hammer.  I bought mine from a local 
auto body supply place.  It's about 15 pounds and is made under the name of 
Morgan Nokker (SP).  It came with several different ends and cost about $110. 
 I've used it for not only dent pulling, pulling fenders into shape, and all 
the other usual body stuff, but have found it handy for dealing with stuck 
brake drums, dizzies, and crank and gen pulleys.  It's a great tool for any 
shop.
                                                                Peace,
                                                                      Frank
