Subject: radio speaker?

Hi All-

I need a radio speaker that fits in the metal bracket that resides under the
bus on my 65' westy.

As there is only room for one speaker up there I am looking for a mono
speaker. I should add that I am running this off a restored Blaupunkt radio
which has very good sound quality- unfortunately the current speaker doesn't
do this nice radio justice.

I prefer sound quality over 100 point restoration- so am not averse to non
OEM speaker as long as it will fit into the original metal bracket without
drilling, sawzalling etc.

Thanks for any suggestions
