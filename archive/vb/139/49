It means that it is different from a distributor with the same numbers
and different last letter.  :)  Seriously - it could mean that the
condenser is a quarter turn further around on the outside, or it could
mean that the advance curve is totally different.  As far as I know
there's not a rule that says A is one thing and B is another, etc.

Check the details page (i.e., click on the "Bus 1971" link).  The
205C is listed for manual Beetles 71-73 and manual 74 Beetles for
California.  The 205D is listed for your Bus, plus autostick Beetles
71-73 and autostick 74 Beetles for California.  You have to check
all the listings until you find one where the part number you're
after is listed to the left of any ">" (supercession mark) in the
"Distributor:" line.  Don't look at the "Can Use:" line for this.
In this case, the 205C is listed under the manual '74 Beetle for
California, and the 205D is listed under the autostick '74 Beetle
for California.

Then, go down the list and see what's different.  The 205C/D use
the same points, condensor, rotor, and cap.  The timing settings
for the original application are the same.  They use different
vacuum cans.  Related to that, the advance/retard curves are a
little different:

205C: Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 5-8deg Adv, 11-13deg Ret; 
                       Centrifugal: 6-12deg (-at-) 1500rpm, 22-25deg (-at-) 3800rpm

205D: Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 2-5deg Adv, 11-13deg Ret; 
                       Centrifugal: 12-16deg (-at-) 2200rpm, 22-25deg (-at-) 3800rpm

The 205C has more vacuum advance.  They have the same centrifugal
advance at full throttle, but the 205D has more advance at part
throttle.  The maximum potential advance is 33 degrees for the
205C and 30 degrees for the 205D.

Compare this to the original part for your Bus, which would have
been 211-905-205Q / 0231 167 055 or 211-905-205S / 0231 180 001.
The 205Q/205S uses the same points and cap and maybe the same
rotor - the 205S had the speed limiting rotor.  The condenser
is different.  They use a different vacuum can than the 205C/205D.
Looking at the advance curve:

205Q: Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 2-5deg Adv, 11-13deg Ret; 
                       Centrifugal: 12-16deg (-at-) 2200rpm, 22-25deg (-at-) 3800rpm

This matches the 205D exactly.

From all the numbers, my guess is that if you put a 205C in your Bus,
it would run OK at idle and at close to full throttle.  At full throttle
and low load, the total timing might be advanced a little too far.  At
part load, the 205C doesn't appear to advance as soon as the 205D, so
you might notice somewhat of a performance drop.
