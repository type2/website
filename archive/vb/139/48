Mine does about the same thing...maybe around 200 at those temps on the
fwy.  I think it is normal.  Lets face it you're pushing a brick through
the air with that little thing and the RPMs are constant.  The motor
does not get to cool down like it does when you're bopping around town
stopping every 4-5 minutes at the next light.

I realize that my guage may not be calibrated correctly, but my bus is obviously running cooler in stop/go traffic than on the freeway.
