Subject: URGENT: NW Vintage Show dirrections

I kinda decided at the last moment to go over to the Vintage Meet friday
afternoon.  If someone could be so kind as to give me some good
dirrectiions to Shoreline Comm. College coming from Pullman (or Vantage)
that would be very, very helpful.  Thanks in advance and I hope to see
some of you over there.  I'll be the one riding around on the '66
Coppertone Schwinn stik-shift Fastback.
