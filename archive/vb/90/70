When I had my '57 standard I drove it everyday.  In the one summer I owned
it it made two round trips from Coeur d'Alene to Boise (almost 800 miles
each round trip), and a round trip from Coeur d'Alene to Seattle.  And
this was all before it was lowered.  That's right, small nut redux tranny
and single port 1600cc (fun!).  And the last trip I took in it before it's
untimely end of life, was a round trip from Coeur d'Alene to Las Vegas!  I
sure do miss that bus, so much so that I'm thinking about trading my
restored oval for another ribbed-bumper bus.
