Subject: radar truck & ladder truck pictures

I visited Wades updated pages and was mightily impressed by the special 
trucks, especially the plumbers truck.
I was inspired to put up some of my pictures from the last two trips to 
Germany.
Specifically the Radar van from Bad Camberg 1999
and the 63 firetruck from the Wolfsburg museum.
There are some hearse & juice truck pictures as well.
