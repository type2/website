Hi Thomas,
Do you mean you have the AUG63 thru OCT64 trailing arms with each arm having 
the bushing on the inner side and needle bearing on the outer side of each of 
the arms?  Or that you have the 1955-AUG63 front beam with the 20mm diameter 
link pins instead of the later 64-67 22mm link pins?   Eric&Barb
