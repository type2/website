Ditto this. I used to attend a trade school auto body repair program. When I
would bring my T3, or crewcab or bug into class to do some work on it, all
the "20 ish" school kids there would flock around my cars ohhing and ahhing
about how cool it was. Invariably, I would here the comment: "I'm going to
get one of those someday" or "do you know anybody that has one of those for
sale?"

I guess Ferdinand had it all going on there.
