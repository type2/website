 Chris,
I am 5' 12" and I have the same problem with my 66 and 67. Both are
non-walkthru's. I had a 67 walkthru that I did not have this problem
with.....I should have kept that one.
I drive my 77 Westy almost everyday.

PS....I have that hinge pin if you still need it. JP was correct, type3's use
the same pins.
