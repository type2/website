EVERY DAY, rain, shine, cold or hot.
Right now the DC is my daily driver and Only driver, 5 miles or 50 miles.
No problems in LA traffic, I keep right up with the best of them, drawing the line
at 80mph.
Gas mileage is great and I love watching the Mercedes SUV owners making their SUV
work overtime to get around me, pass and try and overtake.  "Damn, Martha, you
better take this thing to the dealer, I just barely got by that old VW"

Now what I've done to make the DC, LA traffic worthy is another story altogether.
