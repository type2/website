Subject: RE: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

ooh ooh, I want some of this.
I have a '66 westy that I drive everyday, cold or hot, rainy or sunny and
sometimes snowing.
It doesn't matter what the weather is like or where I'm heading, anytime I
drive, I'm looking through 
two windshields and lovin' every minute of it.
Hopefully I'll be drivein' my DC soon, but until then, it's all about the
westy.
