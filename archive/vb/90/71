Aw, heck, I drive my stock '71 bus in the SoCal environment all the time.
Stay in the right lane, speed around 58-62 and never have a problem.

Lots of vehicles do the same thing, including most of the trucks.
Remember that the truck speed limit in California is 55 still, so most of
them run 60-62 if they want to avoid conversations with John Law, so buses
fit right in.

I suppose I could feel peer pressure to go faster, but I enjoy my bus too
much to shorten the trip!  Just because someone else is driving 90 is no
reason that I have to as well.
