Subject: Re: [VB] Infrared Powder Coating?

Actually, no.  I was able to tour the Purolator plant in SLC while I still
lived up there, and believe it or not, they powdercoat oil filters, BUT,
after the powder is sprayed on, it goes through a very short tunnel  with
special lights.  No heat, just light made it cure.  He let us put our hand
in it, and there was no heat (I think the lights were flourecent)  They
almost looked like black lights.  They were dry to the touch when they came
out the tunnel too.  It was very neat.
