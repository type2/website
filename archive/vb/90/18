For the permanent record, I drive a '63 DC every day to 
work that I'm not riding the bike (too many days) and 
park in front of the City Hall Annex on one of the 
busiest streets in town. 
There's all kinds of people on this list, even people 
who don't live exactly like you. Don't be disappointed 
in the results.
