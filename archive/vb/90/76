InfraRed is an industry standard method of heating the powder coat.

I'm in the process of developing two process controllers for two different
companies.  One that I'm currently finishing the development of a controller for
a line of portable infrared paint curing devices that will do quite well to cure
powder coat.
The company that is building the product has a HUGE powercoat line of their own
where the product runs along on a conveyor and passes through a set of ovens and
infrared emitters.

The other controller I'm designing, uses Eric's paint curing method of
ultraviolet.  That is a completely different method altogether.  Different
paints, etc.  I'm actually surprised that they allowed people to look at the
bulbs/oven without the use of safety glasses to shield the eyes from the UV
exposure.  Nasty stuff.
