all this "bus sighting"  "stuff" (to put it 
politely) leads me to ask the following question/take the following 
poll:

 

how many of you actually DRIVE your bus 
DAILY?!?!?!? (i will also accept any air-cooled vw in place of "bus"). NOT a

honda, ford, chevy, whatever, but a BUS (or air cooled vw)? 

 

no lame "boo-hoo, i have to drive on the freeway" 
excuse. i do too--every day. i go 60-65 and people pass me.

no "boo-hoo, it's too cold" wuss-out. i drove my 
busses every day in cold pennsylvania winters for years--it's called making
the 
heat work well and learning to drive with gloves and a hat. i also learned
to go 
to the car wash somewhat regularly to wash the salt off, and my busses
didn't 
rust out.

no "boo-hoo, but i have to drive "X" amount of 
miles every day" whining. i drive my bus about 50 miles a day.

 

i don't even own any other kind of car, so what 
else WOULD i drive?!

 

i'm just curious.
