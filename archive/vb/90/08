Hi John,
Best to find a 200mm 6 volt FW or there are FW shops that can remove the 12 
volt gear teeth and install a 6 volt ring gear.  The more common 180mm 6 volt 
FW does not to have enough friction area, tending to slip when used with a 
1500 and bigger engine.  Even with the 200mm FW we have had to use a 200mm 
nine spring pressure plate to prevent slipping and they last a lot longer 
then diaphram or sisx spring clutches!
