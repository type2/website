Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

Well, hate to spoil the "I'm so great cuz I'm a he-man and drive my split
everywhere I go" talk, but I've got a few tech questions.  Its still
Tuesday...right??

Reading Dan's page (nice info on the tranny and thing shroud BTW) at
http://www.thatvwguy.com I realized that the PO of my truck must of swaped
the front end at the same time (he must have spoken with E&B) he swaped the
67 tranny in to it (the DC is a 62).  My front end has a sway bar.  When
did these start??  Is that the only way besides the bigger front brakes
that you can spot the difference? 

I also noticed he's using the Berg linkage for the dual Kadrons.  I
recently picked up a set of them with SP manifolds.  The linkage looks very
weak.  Is the Berg the best?  Is there a hex bar set up?
