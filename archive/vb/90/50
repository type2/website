I pretty much drive my 60 Double Cab every day. It saved our butts
building our house. Hauled tons of stuff on it and in it. The only time
I choose the vanagon or the audi is If I need to make a long trip with
the girls. The double cab isn't very safe for the kids. The smallest is
still in a car seat so it isn't so bad but the bigger one is our of car
seats and we have not found a booster that works very well with just a
lap belt. I hope to get shoulder harnesses in this spring. I do as much
or more driving in the Double cab and Thing as I do in our two water
cooled cars.
