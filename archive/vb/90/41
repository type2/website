Subject: Re: Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

well... by this time of year i am sooooo excited to get the bus out of the 
garage, and in the past was my daily from April 1st to November 1st. but we 
moved last winter and i have to take a different route to work with a bit of 
heavy highway merging traffic when i get close to the city. its just too 
hard trying to pay attention to all the OTHER a-holes on the road that wait 
until the last minute to make their moves, to make it enjoyable for me. the 
times i have driven it, im usually so stressed out by the time i get to work 
and its only 7:30, that i tell myself never again. time to get a job in the 
Burbs :)
