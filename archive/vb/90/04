I finally got some time to get out to the DC tonight and finish repairing the
damage from the theft attempt last week.  I had one more switch to install when
a Sheriff drove by.  Next thing I knew he was flipping a U-turn and parked right
in front of the truck.  Surprised me when I found out that he used to be a DC
owner until it was stolen (back in '96).  I thought I had pissed off one of my
neighbors for some unknown reason (whew!)  He told me that he works the night
shift and drives by my house on a regular basis keeping an eye on the truck for
me :-))  I'm going to have to take some extraordinary measures, there were two
DC's in the city that he kept an eye on and the other one is now gone having
been stolen while in a neighboring city.

He's in the market for a DC or a walk-through 23 window.
