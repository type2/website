I'm shorter at 5' 10" or so and often wonder the same thing. If I sit 
up straight my sight gets blocked. But most of the time I'm in the 
non-ergonomic position of leaning over the steering wheel with my 
hands on the top of it. Seems to be the "cool" bus position. Only 
change is when the wind is really bad. Then it's one gripped on the 
top and the other upside down and gripped to the bottom. That's how 
you "break" that bus in windy weather!
