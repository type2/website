Those were the reproduction ones out of Brazil, when I had a few hundred of
them I was selling them for 5 bucks a piece. I loved watching people pay 25
dollars for them on  you know. I am currently out of them but my supplier
said they are getting more soon, as soon as I get them back I will again
offer them for 5 bucks a piece.

Just wondering if anyone had seen a VW gas cap that
has the emblem and also says KOMBI on it? My bus has
one and i was just curious how common it was?
