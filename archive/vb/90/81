Subject: Finally got my bus!  Now comes the questions...

I've been lurking on this list for the last few
months, ever since I got the itch for a split window. 
Well, today I brought my first one home, a 63' westy. 
It's rough, but not too far gone and pretty darn good
for this area ( Western NY state).  Anyway, here are
some of the first questions I've come up with...

What are the correct wheels for this vehicle, 14" or
15"?  The seller has offered me either size...( It
currently has 15" beetle wheels)

It has a 1600 dp with a 2 barrel carb.  The manifold
had PIS cast on it.  How can I identify this to order
a rebuild kit?

The above carb has very little clearance for an air
cleaner...there fore the previous owner ran it without
one.  It has two studs for mounting one.  The engine
runs fairly well, but I'm sure it will need a rebuild
shortly.  Any ideas what type of cleaner I need for
this setup?  

I would like to rebuild the wheel cylinders vs
replacing them.  Is a rebuild kit available for these?

Thanks in advance
