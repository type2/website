Hi gang,
I want to install an original Vacuum Advance dizzy in the stock 1600 sp =
engine that's in my 67 Sundial.

I dug an old vacuum dizzy out of my garage, (probably out of my 66 bug) =
to check out the serial number, etc on it.  The only number I could find =
was stamped into the side.  The number reads ZV/JU4R3.  The dizzy says =
Bosch on the underside, and I know it's an original vw dizzy.  Most of =
the serial numbers I've seen for replacement/original dizzys are =
something like 905 205P, etc, but I can find no number that looks like =
that on this dizzy.  Am I looking in the wrong place, or is this not the =
type dizzy I should be looking for, etc?

TIA
Ed
