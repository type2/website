Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

Well,

My '62 EZ is road ready, I drive it around my neighborhood all of the time, 
but I have not received the registration and plates yet. That is not a Boo 
Hoo. It would be a true Boo Hoo if I got pulled over and got my baby 
impounded! If I had the plates this new 1600SP would have miles on it, even 
though I only work 5 miles from my home!

Daily Driver in Waiting,
Joshua
