Though this seems Friday-ish (and I wish it was Friday already), I'll throw in:

I do.  My '65 camper does a 45 minute commute each way that has 
city/highway/bumper-to-bumper.  A country road would be lovely...  VERY few 
splits here in Tampa that I see out and about.  Though just this morning a 
single cab passed me on the Interstate with a big Brotherhood of Electricians 
sticker on the back.  Big waves and smiles!  I wanna get mine on the road!
