Subject: Re: [VB] can't figure out red light glow

It might just be because of voltage drop in the wiring.  If it goes away
wnen you turn the headlights off, don't worry about it.  My generator
light glowed dimly at night with the lights on.  After replacing the
generator with an alternator (for another reason), it still glows.
