Subject:  Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

At 66 years of age--I no longer have to drive to work.--But I do have my
rounds to make at the Post Office--UPS, which is ome 38 miles round trip, &
telling lies at the various VW Shops,along the way in Phoenix, as well as
daily shopping for food, etc.----The 3 early VWs are kept in the garage,--
1960DC,"Rudy"--1962 "Herbey"--1967 Hippy Bus "Bessie"
Must say one of these is driven everyday--Tonight the 1960DC goes to a VW
Club meeting--Herbey the day before made a run up to Cave Creek for
lunch--It is really cool getting all the waves and hellos driving the early
VWs--As an Old Biker---{1958 Original Sportster}, I enjoy diving and being
seen--Most week-ends there is a Street Rod cruise and/or gathering and one
of the VWs will be there. Lady magoo can hardly wait for the 115+ degree
heat and cruise in one of the VWs--"Keep on Truckin"
