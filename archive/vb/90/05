Subject: couple finds today

   Today I got a phone call from a customer who proceeded to tell me about
some stuff he had come across. He had heard of a 71 Bay DC for sale with
60,000 or so original miles that used to be a dealer truck. He chased it
down and it turns out that the guy who had the truck for sale, dad used to
own a VW dealership that had long ago closed or sold and wanted to liquidate
all of what his dad had left. I don't know if there were any parts or not,
but he did mention his dad's office was full of lit and dealer manuals. My
friend followed through on the stash and if all goes right I will end up
with a ZVW rooftop tent and the ladder that goes to it and an engine dyno
(water something or other) for a very fair price. There was also a 71
Beetle, low mileage and who knows what else. Looks like I'm going to make a
roadtrip this weekend (now that I don't have to worry about missing CdT).
I'm excited to see what there is and it should be fun digging through boxes
of stuff. I will post on Monday what and if anything good comes out of this.

ronnie   follow every lead

ps. The list from the Canadian stash is on it's way to me now. 36 years of
old stock put aside.
