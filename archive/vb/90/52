Subject: RE: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

Boo-hoo......., I am just lame.  I insured my 60 doublecab last spring so I 
could drive it.  I drove it to the Sac show on memorial weekend and thats it 
for the last year.  I parked it in my driveway all summer (3 mo.) without 
moving it an inch.  Stupid, sat in the sun and caused my wood for my 
canvasless tilt to get bleached and same with the wood on my original westy 
rack.  Its in the garage now for the winter as I hate rust.  Still keep it 
insured as I am afraid I will catch the garage on fire as I shoot sparks 
from grinding and welding the vert.  I will paint it again this summer.  I 
think I like working on them more than anything else..........  seriously. 
By the time one is done, one of the other three will need redone.  Never 
ending story and I am happy.
