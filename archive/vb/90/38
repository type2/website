Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

FYI: I don't count driving a bug the same as driving a bus. The bugs 
I've driven run circles around my old bus. You can at least co-exist 
with traffic in a bug. A bus is in a world all it's own. The only 
people even close to me are the extreme senior citizens who will not 
drive over 45mph no matter what! Sometimes I get behind them so 
people will think it's the old guys fault for me going so slow!
