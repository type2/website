Subject: Re: [VB] BUMPERS FOR MY 56

again you are correct. i guess i am still in the "user" train of thought,
and not in the "show car" train of thought. 
i can just see rachel putting the fiberglas bumpers on her truck and
destroying them within months, due to dump runs, small driveways, cement
barriers in parking lots, other cars in parking lots not knowing how to
drive, etc... if these factors were not part of daily use reality, then all
bumpers would be perfect to begin with.
the repro fiberglas ones are fine, and look very nice, but i just don't
think they are the ultimate solution to the daily grind. i'm sure they'd be
fine for vehicles that get driven onto trailers, or only a few miles to a
local show. 
i have really straight bumpers on my shiny bus ('61 westy) and when i
bought the bus they were all painted and nice. after only a year of daily
driving, they already have scratches and dings, and i know i've been bumped
more than once and have whacked them with a toolbox and other parts. i
think if they were fiberglas, i'd have nice piles of costly trash on my
hands.
i guess it all boils down to your particular application and needs. i agree
that ronnie's are a good option, no doubt. some people might not want to go
that way, simply because their busses get driven, and driven hard.
