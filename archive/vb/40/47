Hi James,
From about halfway through the 64 model production of buses JAN64 the 1500cc 
engine was standard for the N. American market while most of Europe ran the 
new 1300.

<<My engine codeis "0 619 293" >>

That should be a late JUNE64 manufacture, which is a very late 64 model.

clearances. >>

Since you have a 1500 this is not a problem.  Only the early (1961-63ish) 
40HP engines had the long studs.  So you have short studs.
