Subject: Westy rear seat

Hey guys, this is my first posting in about a year, on and off working on my 
bus. I have a standard '58, and i bought a rear seat from a '68 westy 
walkthrough. Trouble is  I have no idea how to put it in my bus. The bolts on 
bottom line up, but i can't figure out which way the hinges are supposed to 
face, or if it will even fit at all. Can anyone tell me that it is no use 
trying, or send me some pics of an installed seat that can help me?!     
                                                                   Thanks for 
any help!!!
