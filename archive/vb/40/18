You can run it *if* you use a voltage drop. The sender will work without =
any help, as the y are designed to work on anything from 6-18 volts. Your=
 buddy can use your old one if he runs a voltage drop too.

I just put an NOS 6v gas gauge on ebay.....

Ok, one question will fix two problems.

I just bought an NOS 6v gas gauge, will it work if I convert my bus to 12=
v??
I've seen two different sources that said you can run the 6v one on 12v w=
ith
NO modification.

Also, my bud has a 67 and his fuel gauge is not working, I was wondering =
if
I can replace it with my old 6v one and run it on 12v.

See one question, two problems

Thanks
