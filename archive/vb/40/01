Subject: Re: [VB] transaxle replacement

Guys - Hello

My plan was to just replace the center section with the 64-67 center section
and keep my current reduction gear boxes as the brakes are good etc..
etc.. - but you told me that was a bad idea - so I've been getting my head
around the idea of replacing the whole deal i.e. center section and
reduction gear boxes.

So what kinds speed difference are we talking about i.e. with a 64-67 center
section and 60 reduction gear boxes vs. 64 to 67 reduction gear boxes. So I
gather that by going with 64 to 67 reduction gear boxes I'll have to change
my drums etc...  I'm really at a loss as to what I should do.  I want to
stay stock but I want my bus has practical as possible.  I don't mind
traveling slow ... but I don't want to be a hazard on the road either.
Frankly - today, now, I'm not concerned about a different front  suspension
or better braking.  I may consider a different front suspension in the
future but my brakes really seem to work well.  I've got new brake shoes and
they are adjusted regularly and just work well.  My concern is the howl from
my transmission and the popping out of 4th.  BTW when I'm driving in 4th and
howling really bad if I take my foot off of the gas the howling stops.  I
sort of like the idea of my 60 reduction gear boxes as I now have a spare
set and I have this tool (VW???) that is a vw 36 mm wrench - I was told that
it is for the nuts on the front wheels for keeping the inner one in place
while tightening the outer one.  I don't know if that nut is 36 mm but I do
know that my rear nut is so .... I like the idea of having a vw tool that I
can use (silly you say - I agree).

Anyway, advice is appreciated
