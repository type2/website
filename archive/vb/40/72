Subject: Clearing out some VW Literature

Okay all,

	I am currently clearing out some my VW literature stuff.  **All are photocopies**

	I have the following available on a first come first served basis and the price includes shipping (almost all are over 200 pages)

- 1956 Transporter Parts manual   $40
- 1968-1972 Type 2 Parts Manual   $40

- 1953/1954 Transporter Workshop manual   $40
- 1955 Transporter Workshop manual  $40

- 1955 Special Service Tools manual  $35
- Local Manufacture or Workshop Equipment (updated to Dec 1954)  $40

- VW Key Service <unbound> $40 

- Progressive Refinements (book 1 1940s - Dec 1961)  $25
- Progressive Refinements (book 2 Jan 1962 - 1968)  $25

- VW Transporter Wiring Diagrams 1953-1967 IN COLOR!  $25

	I will have more VW literature and parts up for sale later, but I need to organize it, take pix, etc.  I'll post here to the list before I decide to put it up for Ebay....

	Contact me via P-Mail.  If you have any questions about the stuff, let me know.  I'll cut a discount (for shipping) to those that want multiple items.

THANKS!

PS. Yes, I know that some of this stuff is up for free, on the web, but mine are from a different source and are bound.
