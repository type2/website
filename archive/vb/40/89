Subject: nightmare steering problem

i was in downtown chicago trying to sqeeze into a parking spot when it began 
to happen-my steering wheel seemed to get really loose-like steering a 
boat-then there were creaks and snaps-sharp popping noises when i turned to 
the right and left. any suggestions? i made it home-very carefully-it was 
not a smart idea to drive it, but didn't want to have it towed-so i can 
steer it but the response time is bad-loose-i have to turn the wheel at 
least all the way around to turn it at all. is it the steering box-it seems 
like i can hear a cable down by my feet?
has anyone delt with this before? it is a '67 deluxe.
