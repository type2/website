Hey Michael,

Yep, Lego made some really cool VWs back in the day. There are a host of
buses, bugs, Ghias (the boring Type 1 kind) and even a Notch I believe. The
buses are extra cool, of course, because they came in barndoor versions
originally. The older ones are a little bit larger than the later ones.
They all had plastic bodies and metal wheels.

At Legoland (in Carlsbad) they have a little museum of Lego toys. There's a
display that features a lot of that style of car and includes one of the
"barndoor" buses. It's labled as 1956, so that's around when that style was
being made.

Hope that all helps!

Scott
