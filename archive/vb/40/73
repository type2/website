Hey all,

Well, it was a great day with the start of fall weather on its way into 
Northern California when Strictly Vintage 2s rolled up to Volks Authority 
in San Jose followed by a huge amount of local bus fans and their 
rides!!  Everyone enjoyed a laid back day of socializing, checking out some 
wonderful buses, chowing down on some BBQ, and enjoying the store 
discounts!  Stockton Ave quickly packed up as people from as far away as 
Monterey (although, judging by the license plates, there was someone from 
New Mexico and one from Hawaii!) came out for the activities!  And by far, 
the big event of the day was the successful 1958 Firebus demo!  After 
filling a dumpster with water for about a half hour, we wheeled it out to 
the firebus, cleared the street, spent some time priming and starting the 
water pump (VW powered, naturally), and then simply let fly!!  And also 
thanks to the folks at Volks Authority (www.volksauthority.com) we were 
able to get some MPG footage of the Firebus in action!  I have three little 
videos, but have only the first one up at the Silicon Valley Chapter's site.
