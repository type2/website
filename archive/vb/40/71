Subject: Torque question

Another Wilson book inspired question here (is there a better one I'm
not following?):

The book states T1-3 engines  from73 on with 8 mm studs should only be
torqued to 18 lbs (as opposed to the previously mention in the book
23lbs).  Is this just for the earlier cases WITH OUT case savers?

The engine I'm building has a new case with case saver'd 8 mm studs.  Do
I go with the 18, 23, or 28lbs?  All are mentioned (the 28lb mark is for
10 mm with case savers), but no mention of a case with case savers and
the 8 mm studs.

Thanks!

Steve
