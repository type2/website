The brand new engines from Mexico and Brazil the heads are torgued to 16 lbs
(according to my wrench). If you have OG studs (8mm) torque them to 18 lbs,
if you have aftermarket studs, throw them in the trash and find OG ones, the
aftermarket ones seem to stretch and/or break at 18 ft lbs.

Another Wilson book inspired question here (is there a better one I'm
not following?):

The book states T1-3 engines  from73 on with 8 mm studs should only be
torqued to 18 lbs (as opposed to the previously mention in the book
23lbs).  Is this just for the earlier cases WITH OUT case savers?

The engine I'm building has a new case with case saver'd 8 mm studs.  Do
I go with the 18, 23, or 28lbs?  All are mentioned (the 28lb mark is for
10 mm with case savers), but no mention of a case with case savers and
the 8 mm studs.

Thanks!

Steve
