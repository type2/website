Subject: 6v Gas gauge on 12v?

Ok, one question will fix two problems.

I just bought an NOS 6v gas gauge, will it work if I convert my bus to 12v??
I've seen two different sources that said you can run the 6v one on 12v with
NO modification.

Also, my bud has a 67 and his fuel gauge is not working, I was wondering if
I can replace it with my old 6v one and run it on 12v.

See one question, two problems

Thanks
