Well, with a split or early bay I would figure it involves the lack of
sleeping area for the passengers...Sure, my bus sleeps two, even three if
they're close, across the full width bed...but it comfortably rides three
to four in the back, 2 or three up front.  A split without the so44 kit
has a narrower bed...two is more reasonable.  An early bad adds just a
single uncomfortable (i've slept in it for a week, i know!) cot up top..

There is always the across-the-front-seat option, but....

soo, if you've got kids (or just friends along for the ride..) where do
you put them?  Tent?  Annoying, perhaps wet and cold as well.

(not to mention you can stow more gear for the additional people with the
trailer..and with a self contained trailer, it doubles, perhaps, your
kitchen space!)
