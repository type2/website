Subject: Headlight switch repair article now available!

All,

A new article has been added to the Library on type2.com describing
how you can repair your headlight switch for cooler operation and
brighter lights.  Eric&Barb and I worked on the article together.
It is linked from the Library indexes, and is available directly at

http://www.type2.com/library/electris/vw-hauptlicht-schalter.html
 
Please let Eric&Barb or me know if you have any questions or spot
any errors in the article.  Thanks!

Matt Roberds
