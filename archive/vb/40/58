Subject: Hate to throw it all away...

Not really tossing and trashing anything but junk. Was actually thinking about
the saying about "...is another man/woman's treasure" as I was tossing the
stuff.

One question that I have is this:
I have a splittie bus steering wheel that is majorly messed up. Hub, one spoke
and 3/4 of the wheel are OK. The rest is missing as in gonzos. At what point do
the regular professional and quasi-professional wheel restorers call the cores
too far gone?

Any Phx locals starting with reps of AZ Buzz Club are welcome to a rough wheel
core and a rat's nest butt load of OG VW wiring. First come/first serve at my
door starting at 6PM Az time today. Will take first email or phone call to the
home number followed by knocking on my door. If you know me well enough to know
the numbers and address then come ahead.
The stuff is literally in the garbage.
