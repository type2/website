Gas gauges work on the resistance in a line and not the voltage. So you do
not need to put a voltage drop in to use it, but you do need to change the
bulb to a 12V. I will admit then when I have had both 6v and 12v gauges open
on the bench at the same time the helix coil on a 12 volt is a heaver gauge.
I have seen 6v fuel gauges work in a 12v systems for years and years with
out any problems.  Key note: make sure your wiring is correct, if you
accidentally  get a grounding loop in your electrical system, the 6 volt
will probably die fairly quickly. Grounding loops can be spotted with your
gas gauge by turning an accessory on or stepping on the breaks. The needle
will all of a sudden jump up to a full tank. If this happens stop and FIX
IT.
Good luck
Shawn

Through the years i have mixed gas gauges of 6 Volt and 12 Volt in my
buses--of 6 volt and 12 volt--To date there has never been a
problem--sometimes the reading is a little different--but none of the gauges
have failed--hope this helps--TWWM, uj
