Subject: RE: [VB] Re: I got a hump!

as far as i've seen, there are 3 different seat styles between 3/55 and 63
when they went to the split type front.
style 1: 3/55-58: thin, low padding seat. thin and not much spring height.
looks almost rectangular from the sides.
style 2: 59-60: thicker springs, taller. also a more rounded upper part
when looking at the side.
style 3: 61-62: "the hump" style. the bottom is shorter than the 2 previous
styles. also has hooks on the seat frame itself to support the top piece
rather than the sheetmetal brackets on the body. is shorter to make up for
the 3 way bracket adjuster fore/aft. the top also has the 3 way bracket
adjuster. also the tabs on both the top and bottom cushion are smaller to
fit in the adjuster holes in the 3 way adjuster bracket. upper part has a
hump, formed by the springs internally. don't know why.
