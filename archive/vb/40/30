Subject: Funky Engine/Chassis Codes..HELP!

Fellow Type 2 Owners...
I recently aquired a 1964 VW bus from the original
owners. It has been sitting for 13 years, and I just
got it running. Unfortunatly, I'm a bit stumped about
a couple things here. First, I can't decipher my
engine code, or match it up with the chassis code.
It's a standard kombi with either a 1200 or a 1500
engine..this is where the problem lies. My engine code
is "0 619 293", Which, as far as I can tell doesn't
match up with any engine ever put in the transporter
line, (or any vw type, for that matter?). My chassis
number is "1 326 170". Both of these are the original
numbers, which I verified by looking at the original
service booklet and warranty information supplied from
the dealer in Boston, Mass. in 1964 (9-4-64). I don't
understand, because it would seem that to be a 1500
engine, it needs a letter code, and to be a 1200 it
needs a totally different number. Can anyone tell me
what's up? Or, at least, is there any way to tell
externally what type of engine is in my car. Gah!
Also, what is the difference between the long studs
and short studs in the valve area..I've heard there is
a difference when adjusting valve clearances. I'm at
the end of my rope, having scoured Chilton's manual,
The idiots guide, and internet sources. 
Thanks in advance for the help.
