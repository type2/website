Just short the wire to the steering column and see if the horn honks with
everything hooked up. If so, the problem is the horn button. This is getting
more common as these precious darlings age. The original wire had a fairly
long sleeve on it with protruded up to hit the brass dome inside the button
part. Over the years they get bent, broken, cut off, replaced. Short term
you can strip a little extra wire and make sure it sticks well up past the
setscrew. Won't last long though. Best to get a sleeve crimped on there and
make sure it sticks up so the button hits it before it bottoms out in the
horn ring. If your sleeve is still there, slide it farther into the hole
before tightening the screw.
