Hey Kyle, that sounds like the advice you gave me on how to remove my
e-brake pivot pin a while ago...

>>The procedure goes something like this. Sink a two and a half inch
diameter

up.
>>Arrange the bus over the bar and weld the e-brake pin to the bar. Call a
>>heavy duty wrecker in and strap around the bus at both ends and winch the
>>bus off of the pin. Dispose of the bus. Carefully remove the pin from the
>>steel bar. Place it into a bus that is missing the e-brake pivot pin.
