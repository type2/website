westfalia believes that a trailer and a camper are needed in certain cases.  quoting from a 1961 westfalia owner's manual:  "For VW Camper users who wish to travel with large families or more than two adults we recommend the Westfalia Caravan 'Landstreicher 295-4.'  It is very light and easy to tow and accommodates four adults.  The caravan can also be fitted with a side tent."  of course this has nothing to do with pucks....
