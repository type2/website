Subject: Re: [VB] Help with steering wheel

Easiest way is to pop off the horn button and the nut holding on the wheel,
then squirt a little of you favorite WD40'ish lubricant down the key, then
heat up the pot metal hub of the wheel with a propane or MAPP gas torch.
Heat it up for about 30 seconds then bang on the bottom of the wheel with
both hands, one on either side.  After a few good whacks it should come off.
If not heat it up again and repeat.  This is the only way I have found to
get a wheel of without damaging it.  Obviously you have to be a little
carefull with the torch.
