Subject: I got a hump!

Hi Volks,
I have been lurking a lot lately, enjoying the wealth of info this list 
brings. In August, I obtained a '60 DD Panel.  Over the past two months, I 
have been tinkering, admiring, and dreaming ;0) I noticed for the fist time 
tonight the odd front bench.  It has a hump in the back rest.  I don't 
think this is the correct seat because the base is not as wide as  I think 
it should be.  Any ideas as to what it came out of?  Thanks

Joy thru Air,
