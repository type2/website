Subject: Almost free '67 project...continued

Well, we're happy, and Joel's happy.  Joel Bidinger, that is.  He came up
today with a large dually p/up and trailer (borrowed) and took Mathilde
away.  We had to do a bit of work to make the bus roll-worthy, and some
grunting heaving the trailer around by hand (small driveway), but we managed
easily enough, and the winch pulled the bus onto the trailer no problemo!

Really good to meet yet another great personality associated with VW's and
the List....I am confident that that particular '67 will relatively soonly
be seeing the taillights of passing SUV's in a Zen way, and I hope to see
you, Joel, at BBB 2002!

Here's two pics:
