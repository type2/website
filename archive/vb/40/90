It SOUNDS like when my lower torsion tube rusted away at one end...

But i dunno.  put your head under there.  I suspect whatever it is will be
VERY obvious. If not, it will be when you borrow a nut..er..hand..and put
it behind the wheel while you watch.

Could be anything though.  box may have unbolted? something related to the
swing lever may have gone...who knows.

look and tell us. :)
