Yes...62 is one year only for the walk-thru's!!!!
I believe the later passenger seat may indeed fit, but the back will be too
high. The driver's side has a different mounting bracket on the right side.
I do have a set here that I don't need. They will need to be recovered.. I'm
not sure how to ship these from Canada to Texas though!!!!
