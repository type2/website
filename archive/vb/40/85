You could always make your own... Which would probably be cheaper.

hey everyone- ive bee4n working on my 58 dd panel and i would really
like to have one of those rear doors (the one above the engine
conpartment) that has NO window. i dont mean i want one with no glass, i
want one that is jsut a solid piece of metal. i think these are UBER
sexy. i would be willing to trade one with a window (w/glass) pluss cash
or othere parts. if you have seen one around, or know someone who has
one, please tell me. i dont car if it has a few dents as long as the
metal isnt torn and there is no cancer. paint doesnt matter. thanks,
meredith 65 w/t camper 62 standard 58 dd panel
