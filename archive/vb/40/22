kyle, your thoughts and humor are very much
appreciated.  on a serious note, one of the big
reasons i don't like driving my single cab as my
commuter car is that it's been butt slammed already
under previous ownership.  i used to have a u-shaped
middle brake light deck lid and my truck has some
thick filler to show for that little encounter.

when i drive my single cab in stop and go traffic i
feel as if i look through the rear view more than the
split screen.  i know that i also try to send
telepathic messages to all the drivers behind
me... "watch the middle light, don't look at the
lights at the sides, the middle light, watch the
middle light."

while my 67 beetle is being repaired, i'll drive my
<gasp> 1956 beetle unless the smell of this afternoon's spilled sweet banana peppers drives
me out... then i'll turn to my truck.  yeah, i know, i can hear you know... if i'd taken my truck to the
store instead of the beetle i could just hose it out
and call it good.  oi!  ;-)
