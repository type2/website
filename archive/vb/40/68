Sergio,

I have heavy duty puller I built just for removing steering wheels. I
am in Torrance and if your bus will drive over here, I can remove it
for you. Let me know. I will Pmail my address to you and we can
arrange a time.

By the way, I have some very nice looking steering wheels if you would
like to buy one.

Chris,
The Steering Man
