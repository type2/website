That's painful to even hear of...
I think I need an Alka Seltzer.

Isn't that practice punishable by jail time in the lower 48 states?

We East Coasters will GLADLY accept a LOT (not all) of what the Westerners consider to be ****. 
Gladly!  We're over here restoring rust-piles that a 300lber, such as myself, could crawl in one
side of and then limbo out the other.   ...and I've got the empty bottles of Red Stripe to prove
it.  :)ha!

Over here, we consider the bus that has the largest hole in the floor to be "best."  We even hear
tell of a feller down in South Caroliny that reported a 20% decrease in overall stopping distance
since the "installed" rust-holes.  He does wear a size 14 boot, though.
