Subject: BUMPERS FOR MY 56

Does anyone out there know where I can find a front ribbed bumper(or a set)
for my new project, a 56 combi,in decent shape at a reasonable price.I'm
also going to need both front doglegs.
  Thanks for all the response on the early panel van. I'm still looking for
the right one though.Thom and everyone at vintagebus are the best.

]            Thanks again,
Derek Scott
