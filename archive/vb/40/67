DOH! too late! City of Phoenix hauled it away to the dump this AM. Dang. Just
when someone told me that as long as the metal frame was good then it could be
reused. I will have to flog myself as an act of contrition. <like that would be
a change...> ;-)
Dang! Wire is still available.
Question is why would I recycle a rats nest of OG wire but toss a steering whl
core?
Answer: Ellis is in a scorched Earth clean-up mode.
