From the little bit of research I have done regarding Cali plates I have found a few tidbits of info.

The last total re-issue of plates was in 1963, with the black plates with yellow numbers/letters.  So technically these plates are still correct for your 57. So basically, the og owner probably had the yellow plates with black writing when it was new.  Then in 63 went to renew his registration and was given the new black plates and those have been on the car since.
