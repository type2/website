Subject: RE: [VB] '54 single cab 4 sale

Hi All,  Read this ad, it claims that it has the original wood slats in
it...

If anyone is willing to buy this truck, I'd be willing to give you a brand
new box of 100 stainless steel screws that match the original slat screws
this truck has in it plus $100!
