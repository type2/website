Well, I've made headway on the frankenmotor. Been told that to use a type 3
motor in a bus all thats needed is a dipstick adaptor and to tap for an oil
sensor. Thats almost right, also need to replace the oilcooler stud with a
bigger stud and drill out the two case holes for bigger bolts, also need to
replace the fuelpump mounting studs with longer ones, at least for a case
that came with FI. Nice thing about the case is it came with the moustache
bar holes.

Only thing I've found wrong with the engine so far, is the dist gear was
chewed up and this was causing the engine to lock up 3/4 thru a revolution.
Made quick work of that-stole the gear off the crank that came with the
engine in the bus-pressed it on easy as butter.

Only reason for going thru all this was the engine that came out of the 68
was from a 74 bug with a spun rod. Geez talk about damned po's this was an
auto case and carb, bug dist, rod spun so bad it was welded to the crank. No
way to keep cost down when right off the bat crank and case both have to be
turned.

Found a complete type 3 motor for $140 cdn, guy bought it for his type 411
and wondered why it didnt fit. Wouldnt turn a complete revolution but even
while I played with it it loosened up. Pulled valves and none are burnt or
stretched. Sometimes you win!
