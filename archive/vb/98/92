All,

I've been meaning to do this for a while and I finally got a round
tuit.  I have made a chart showing the engine and suspension options
for '63-'65 Buses and the resulting reduction gear box nut sizes and
gear ratios.  It covers stock Buses and Buses with options M 92,
M 215, and M 216.  It's based on the '67 parts manual in the doc
project, the '63-'67 Bentley manual, the Doliwa book, and email
exchanges with listees including Eric&Barb and Clara W.

The chart is below.  Note that the gear ratios given are only for
the reduction boxes; Buses with M 92 also had a different final
drive gear which is not shown in this chart.

Any comments, suggestions, additions, corrections, and deletions
are welcome.  Or if this is already explained better somewhere
else, let me know that too.

Thanks!

Matt Roberds

From August 1962:  (beginning of '63 models)
  Standard           1200  15"  3/4 ton  36 mm  1.39:1  1.69:1

From August 1963:  (beginning of '64 models)
  Standard           1200  15"  3/4 ton  46 mm  1.39:1  1.69:1
  M216               1500  15"  3/4 ton  46 mm  1.26:1  1.39:1
  M215               1500  14"* 1 ton    46 mm  1.26:1  1.39:1

From December 1963: (halfway through '64 models)

  Standard           1500  14"  1 ton    46 mm  1.26:1  1.39:1

* The info I have says '64 Buses with M 215 got 14" wheels at
  chassis 1 145 427 on 5 Aug 1963, about 1100 Buses later than
  the start of '64 production on 5 Aug 1963 at 1 144 282.  So
  there could have theoretically been some '64 Buses with M 215
  and 15" wheels.
