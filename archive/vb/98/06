Pete,
also make sure all of the adjuster tabs on the backing plates (hope that des=
cription works) are intact  From experience I have seen the adjusters back o=
ff from the tabs being too far bent up or broken off.

I just recently had to fab some for my 63, from some banding strap.  Check t=
he archives and you should find some info to help.
