Subject: Re: [VB] 5 spoke rims won't fit????

Yes, they will fit on the rears with the correct adapter studs: 14mm on one 
end into the drum and 1/2 x 20 SAE thread on the other end with the correct 
1/2 x 20 chrome lug nuts.  The only problem is that there will not be any 
room for the center cap to fit on as the axle nut will stick out too far.  I 
solved that one by turning some aluminum spacers on a lathe at work.  They 
space the center caps out about an inch or so.  I do not know how they will 
work on the rear of the later (big nut) RGB.  Perhaps someone else knows off 
hand.  I have a drum-to-drum transaxle from a '65 that I want to use for the 
added braking.

As for the fronts, I am planning to rebuild a later ('65) front beam, 
drum-to-drum for my '61 DC and this will not only allow the wheels to fit, 
but also give me a little better stopping power with the wider brakes.

You should be able to go to any reputable wheele/tire supplier and get the 
metric x SAE studs and the lug nuts.
