Consider yourself fortunate that the broken studs removed easily.
As long as you have hand drill access to the repair and are
accurate with it, there is every possibility of a successful repair.
Do not over-drill. Once the hole is made, immediately remove the drill.
My personal preference is to stop the tap short of the necessary full thread,
and let the  insert cut/swedge the final thread for a tight clamp.
If you are using a taper tap, the final thread is there, just not cut full depth.
i also use threadlocker liquids. Others may not, i don't care.
In future repairs, you might consider using heat to remove any exhaust nut
which you aren't personally acquainted with. Never had a stud break with heat.
