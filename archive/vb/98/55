I purchased a set of the 5 spoke polished wheels made by American Eagle for 
my 59 bus and thought it would be a matter of unwrap and bolt...NOT.  the 
first thing that doesnt work is the hardware kit as it is all 14mm and I 
didn't even think about that originally.  Next is that the wheels will work 
on the back with some special lug bolts (where can I get them) and the fronts 
won't fit at all.  (are people using spacers??)  I think I may have to change 
the brake drum, but then I imagine there will be a lot more to change to.  
The rear drum looks like a spiral and the front is a well to big to clear the 
center of the wheel that in turn would allow it to sit flush.  I need some 
help again guys and gals, cause these wheels were a little investment so I 
have to keep going.
