I wonder what they use to glue the ends together.  If it's something
that mortals can obtain, maybe it would help to separate it at the
joint and install it on the glass to see if the ends overlap.  If
they do, cut maybe half the overlap off of one end and glue it back
together, making the seal smaller.  Just thinking out loud.
