check to make sure you have the proper amount of 
pushrod freeplay between it and the end of the master cylinder. adjust by 
tapping on the pedal stop (under the bus) where the pedal/pushrod stops on. i 
guess you could also adjust the pushrod itself. if there is pressure on the 
master cylinder, as in no freeplay (1mm from end of pushrod to inside the cup of 
the mastercylinder) it won't release pressure on the system.

are your brake lights on all the time? this is a 
good indication that the master cylinder is not releasing pressure 
properly.

Hi List,

My 63 crew cab is having some breaking problems. It

keeps "gaining" pedal. I've replaced the master

cylinder, brake hoses, and wheel cylinders on one

wheel that was obviously leaking. The other wheel

cylinders seem fine. Has anyone had this problem and

if so, can anyone tell me what the heck else I can

look for?

 

Thanks,

 

3DPete

63 crew cab - Buck
