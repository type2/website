Subject: 15" wheels to narrow for todays tires?

Ok, from all of the stuff you guys have posted and all the information I
have gleaned the 205/75/15 is supposed to be the tire. Here is the catch
22. Everyone makes such a big deal about the load range being right in
order to be safe right? Are all of you just ignoring the minimum rim
width for these tires? There is not a tire that I can find that has any
kind of multiple ply rating and will go on a rim narrower than 5".
Talking to the Tire Rack and Les Schwab, who you would think would be
wanting to sell me a set of tires, both feel this is a big deal. They
both said they would not do this. I found a really cool Continental
LS23D which is for the Eurovan, it is a touch smaller with a diameter of
25.7 inches in the 195/70/15 size but has a load rating of 1985lbs. But
again the narrowest rim they recommend is 5". I guess my question is are
you all ignoring this and running them anyway? Has there been any
problems? I hate to go to a 14" wheel but that would get me my minimum
5" width.
thanks in advance for any input,
