I know, I've looked around and in some places (like SoCal) you can buy new
cheaper than used. I was used to paying like 50$ bucks for a dolly but last
time in Cali they nailed me for 350$ for a one way, seems everyone is
leaving SoCal so they raise the rate. In this case the guy just wants to get
rid of it so its cheaper to buy it than a trailer. This way I can haul one
or more.
