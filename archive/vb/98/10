Subject: seat covers and pads

OK, so I have the new seat covers and horsehair pads
to redo the front 1/3-2/3 seat of my bus. Cool! So what
next? No instructions...hmmm...   Me not being an 
upholsterist, upholsterer or what ever, I haven't the
foggist how to proceed. I checked the archives but found
no articles on how to properly recover VW seats. I 
figure that I could just slap the pads on and yank the
covers over, but I'm sure there's something more to it.
HELP! (again...)
Many thanks in advance!
