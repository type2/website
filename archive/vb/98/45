 I had this same problem in my 63 DC.  WW showed a little gas pedal
spring/clip like element in their online catalogue, so I ordered 1, but I
couldn't figure out where to install it!!  Finally after the gas pedal broke
off the floor mount, I retrieved an entire pedal assembly of a donor bus,
and lo and behold, There was the spring still in place between the bottom
back of the pedal and the spot welded hinge plate on the bus floor.  It was
rusted, and snapped in half in my hand, but at least I knew where it went,
and installed the new WW clip.  My gas pedal now springs back and salutes
like its on Viagra!!  You learn somethin' every day!
