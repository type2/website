Sure thing!

I will give an update when I bolt it on to report on fit and ease of
install.


Have a happy Easter and a Good Friday ;)

Adrian,
Let us know how easily it bolts up.  Fit is the main reason I am currently
on 
the verge of scooping up one of Ron's German stocker kits.  I'll wait to
hear

BTW, BD's support people are working on an f'ed security patch from MS that
is 
causing the site's difficulties...
