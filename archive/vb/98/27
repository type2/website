Subject: Re: [VB] Rev Limiting Rotors

When I sold my 71 westy it needed a rev limiter for test drives, a guy and 
his girlfriend came to drive the bus that had a fresh 1600 in it, I saved my 
1776 out of it for my 63, he said he had a bus before and driving a stick was 
no problem so he gets in starts it up and down to the floor the gas pedal 
went 6500 rpm on the VDO tach and up on the clutch, I asked him if he was 
sure his other bus wasn't an automatic. His girlfriend who has never driven a 
bus before did a much better job than him. Well, they bought the bus and were 
planing to go to California to live in it for a while I wonder how far they 
made it. Doug Lewis
