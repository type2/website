Subject: selling my ford conv for a good cause! Duh!

Hello list,

Harry made me realize something I forgot to mention about selling my ford 
convertable.  I am useing the money from it, and a Rabbit I have for sale to 
fund my "Save the Double Cab Fund".  Yes, I have found a very nice db very 
close to me, but unfortunatlly for me, the guy knows his VWs and also wants 
a Harley.......  So I am selling my conv.  I am not attched to it or 
anything, I actually bought it when I was younger to fix up and sell to a 
friend, but I got caught up with our farm, VWs, and college, (and besides, 
I'm a Chevy person myself).  So now that you all know what I am pineing for, 
you can send all donations to:

338 Hamilton Hall
Residence Area
University Park Pa

lol,
I dont have the conv on ebay yet, but will prolly next week.  I will keep 
the list posted on my progress.  I want to just use it as a daily driver for 
now and focus on some other things, but eventually will restore and paint it 
identically to my 67 beetle.

thanks!
Matt

Matt,
  Glad to help. You should have told the list that you're
going to use the Ford money to buy/restore a vintage bus!

  No immediate relatives around PA. I was born in Ohio
where you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a bunch
of German farmers named Houck.
