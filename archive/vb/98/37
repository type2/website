Subject: Throttle cable question

  My 63' bus has a 16DP with a 34 pict 3.  Right now,
the only return spring for the thottle is the one on
the carb. It isn't strong enough to fully return the
pedal.  Should there be an additional return spring
somewhere?  The original cable was pretty rough, so I
already replaced it (fully greased ) but it made
little difference.

Thanks in Advance
Matt
