Subject: Barn Door For Sale

All this talk about how much money barn doors are being sold for has persuaded me to sell mine. I figure I should be able to get about $10K Grand for it in this market. Here's the description: Original White paint, All original, excellent for daily use as is or a great restoration candidate. Includes all hardware and accessories. The hinges are a bit rusty, but you can get new ones at the hardware store.  However, I need a weeks notice before selling it so I can replace it with a different one, I must replace it immediately so my livestock can't get out of the barn. Will also trade for an early Porsche 356.   What?!?!?!?!
