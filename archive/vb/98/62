Mmmm.  Now, I'm no expert on 15" bus wheels, but i'd swear they were
at least 5" wide...at least the ones I've seen.  Are you sure you dont
have bug 15" wheels?

Anyone want to back me up on the correct width of the 15" bus wheel?  I'll
look in the Bentley when I get home...

(yes. a 4 or 4.5" wheel IS to narrow for a 195 width tire. a 5" is JUST
big enough to fit in a 195 without problems.)
