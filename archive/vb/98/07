I think it's possible.  I have an early '64 (built November '63) and
it has 15" wheels and big nuts.  The date codes on the wheels match
the Bus.  I don't know if the trans/RGBs are original but they appear
to be.

>wheels right?

1500s were an option through the beginning of the '65 model year
(1 October 1964); after that the 1500 was standard.  The 1500 option
seems to have started with the 1963 model year.  One-ton models went
to 14" wheels in August 1963; regular models went to 14" wheels in
December 1963.  It looks like big nuts came about in August 1963.

So it looks like you could have ordered a 1500 on a Bus with 15" rims
for the 1963 model year.  For '64, if you ordered a 1500 with a one-ton
rating, you got 14" wheels all year; if you ordered a 1500 with a normal
rating early in the year you got 15" wheels - later you got 14".

My Bus has a 1500 from a '68 Beetle in it right now; I'm not sure
what it would have had originally.

Fastest production split, maybe.  Even though the bays were heavier,
the fuel-injected Type 4 engines could crank out a lot of power.

Wow!  Think of all the money you'll save on buying manuals and reference
books!
