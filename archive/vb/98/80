That's exactly why I just put up the cash for a trailer. I got a NEW 
16 ft. double axle trailer with ramps for around $850.00. Funny thing 
is used ones don't sell for much cheaper than that around here. Made 
sense for me and much safer. I've gotten way more than my money back 
on it. I use it all the time for stuff other than hauling VW's. I 
help friends retrieve VW's as well. Even towed my brothers '55 Ch*vy 
2-door home on it. Money well spent.
