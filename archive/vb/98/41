I guess I should clarify that... I'd give you the new box of ss screws and
$100 for the complete set of original bed slat screws...

I originally wrote and pressed the send key too fast... >>>
Hi All,  Read this ad, it claims that it has the original wood slats in
it...

If anyone is willing to buy this truck, I'd be willing to give you a brand
new box of 100 stainless steel screws that match the original slat screws
this truck has in it plus $100!
