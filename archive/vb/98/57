Subject: RE: [VB] 5 spoke rims won't fit????

Those 5 spokes won't fit on early drums(when I say early, we are talking pre
~62) The center of the drums, where the drum is bolted to the axel, is too
wide to fit the center of the rim.  I recently saw a set of 5 spoke that
were "machined" to accept the wider hub.

It's an ugly option.  Your other 'ugly option' would be to switch the brakes
to later 60's brakes.  Of course you would have to change spindles, and
backing plates.

It's a bad scene indeed...

I purchased a set of the 5 spoke polished wheels made by American Eagle for
my 59 bus and thought it would be a matter of unwrap and bolt...NOT.  the
first thing that doesnt work is the hardware kit as it is all 14mm and I
didn't even think about that originally.  Next is that the wheels will work
on the back with some special lug bolts (where can I get them) and the
fronts
won't fit at all.  (are people using spacers??)  I think I may have to
change
the brake drum, but then I imagine there will be a lot more to change to.
The rear drum looks like a spiral and the front is a well to big to clear
the
center of the wheel that in turn would allow it to sit flush.  I need some
help again guys and gals, cause these wheels were a little investment so I
have to keep going.
