Subject: sears/penske air fuel ratio meter 

Hi group  have a question to ask all,does anyone in any of our vintage bus  
group own a sear/penske air-fuel meter model # 244.21012 . bought one in yard 
sale but no instructions, would anyone have one and if so would they scan 
instruction and e-mail them to me i've been trying to adjust carb and fuel 
injection on v-dubs with it but have a hard time figuring it out .   thanks
