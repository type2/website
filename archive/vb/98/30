Lou, we will be back to the bus this weekend and can get some of the dia.
but your numbers sound "close to ours"
As Philip remembers. We have the type 4 cooler with stock big nut trans
205r15 tyres. It does take some heat soak time maybe 30 min. of hard (60
mph) running on the hot days then the temp would be 225 and wanting to go
up but we slow down to 3000 rpm about 50 mph, this can control the temp
but if a hill or faster speed then up the temp. goes.
Thanks for looking yours data up
P & C
can not wait for the big red barn :)
