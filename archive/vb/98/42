 the only return spring for the thottle is the one on

 somewhere?  The original cable was pretty rough, so I
 already replaced it (fully greased ) but it made
 little difference.

The one spring should be fine- unless you have a extra heavy pedal- like if 
you have that bare foot thing on it.   I do, so I use a spring between the 
upper & lower carb halves, and also between fan housing and carb- the old 
school one on the accelerator cable.  But maybe your spring is just wimpy and 
you need a stronger one.  It should spring back real snappy.

Did you grease up the linkage by the pedal?
