Subject: Re: [VB]   High roog owner alert

Just saw an example of the need for that yesterday, on a fellow listee's
VERY nicely done '59 23 Window with Safari Windows that he's converted to
RHD & DD, it was the first time that it's been in heavy rain since he
completed the full restoration, and while every other seal was holding up
well, the WCM Safari seals were letting lots of water in, in the bottom
corners, so he's having to put towels etc on the dash to soak it up a bit,
to prevent his electrics being drenched, not good!.

Doesn't WW sell foam core door rubber by the foot anyways?

WCM should spend more time getting the stuff they already sell, a little
more accurate.
