 Hey Philip, sorry I don't have the motor back together yet but
I measured the two pulleys and the Porsche is 3-3/4" dia. and 
I'm using a "D" bottom pulley which is 7".  I realize this won't
tell the ratio but it does note the differences in top pulleys, stock
1600(?) being 4-1/4".  Bergmann recommends the Porsche pulley
especially when using a type 4 cooler, I also think it's a great 
idea when running a "freeway flyer" tranny because it will bring 
the fan speed, re: 'air flow through the cooler' back to where it
should be given the motor is turning over slower do to the tranny
gear ratio. 
 I had this on my 1904cc motor last summer and it the oil temp.
never reached 220 deg. even doing 70 mph up the hill from Havasu
to I-40, air temp. was 98 deg.
 I pulled the motor because of a "bad" balancing job done locally.
I will do a 'ratio' measurement ASAP when the motor is back together.
  These are things that worked for me!
     Lou & Liz in Havasu
