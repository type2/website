The SyFy cable station had a marathon day of the 80's TV show, The Greatest American Hero over the Independence Day holiday. Being the nut I am, I watched them all!

One episode stands out however, it was titled, Love Venusion Style.

Not only did it have a Splitty, it was used throughout the show.

It appeared painted like a hot dog bun, with dogs sticking out fore and aft. The bad guys were using the vendor as a lookout. Parking must have been a challenge.

The good guys later jumped in it as an escape vehicle.

The aliens commandeered it remotely and as it was heading into the desert it was "clocked" by the CHP going 113 mph!

Lots of shots through the cracked front windshield and interior shots looking forward, along with exterior views.

I saved this episode on the DVR.

Jeff - alas busless
