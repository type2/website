Subject: RE: [VB] pics of my '65 & sound stuff

I have not driven it yet, unfortunately. It is in my driveway, and I try to
spend a little time each night cutting and adding more sound proofing stuff.
I'm still on the damplifier stuff. I notice the body sounds way more solid
wherever I have put it. I am putting time in almost every night.but it is a
little bit at a time.as I have been working late, and aside from being tired
and bugs, there are also lighting issues.

 

I'm thinking of how to apply the luxury liner pro. This needs to be spray
mounted to install, and I imagine it makes a big mess of the interior,
unless you mask judiciously.

 

I thought I had the cab roof direction vane all set, but noticed something
happened to it, and the handle won't turn. It looks like a washer broke, or
is not in the right place.I've got to figure that out.

 

I'll post more pics as I continue.

So, are you driving it yet?

 

I bought 100sq ft of Fatmat sound deadening, which looks a lot like the
stuff you used in your EZ camper.

 

This is for my 66 kombi, which is a rattley empty tin box.   I have
installed about half the sound deadening, and not noticed a huge difference
when driving.     It is more that well yes, it might be a bit quieter,
maybe.   See what I mean?    

When I knock on the bus, it does sound more of a thud that a ting ting ting,
though.  

 

 

Oh well, when I get an interior in it I am sure it will be quieter. 

 Finally got the cab roof directional vane seals ordered, can install the
cab roof panels when those are in.
