Hi Kevin,
Here  are our reasons:

1.  Different metals expand at different rates.  Aluminum swells up
faster bigger than steel or cast iron.  So if too cold the aluminum
pistons do not fit in the cylinders big enough to avoid wobbling around
and wearing/ruining over time if the P&Cs are too cold.  Formula Vee
racers used to hone out bigger the stock cylinders to avoid having the
pistons seizing in the cylinders due to the really high temps and RPMs
those engines were run.  They  were not worried about longevity due to
rebuilding several times over a racing season.  Not the years and tens
of thousands of miles most drivers of VWs are shooting for between
rebuilds.

2. Piston ring will not seal properly if the pistons are not fitting
properly in the cylinders.

3.  If piston rings are not sealing a lot more raw fuel gets to the oil
past the rings.

4.  Water and oil accumulate in the oil reducing lubrication, AND
TURNING OIL ACIDIC.

5.  Plus at lower temps the oil itself does not lubricate properly and
get into all the tighter places in the engine as well as it should.

Still if he engine is getting and staying above 160F after a few
minutes of driving all of the above seems to be not a problem.  Would
think that if a problem VW could easily made the thermostat for the
flaps to open at a higher temp..........
