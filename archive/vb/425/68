Yep, even my 63 DC has it, & I have all redone upholstery w/ foam  
pads, no horsehair(have not done that again)
& once a week when I get in it to run the engine for awhile, I notice  
that smell.  I too, love it.
My 65 westy w/ new horsehair pads also has the smell.

YMMV,

Mr. BZ-the smell boss, the smell!
