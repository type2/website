Subject: oil temp rehash, valve check, Summer Jam

Hi,

Crawled under my bus last night to do a valve check. Nice clean heads. No
changes to the valve settings. No brown coating at 12,000 miles. I guess that
means I have a cool running heads. The oil however is quite dark. Maybe time
to change.

And yes, I did the valves the mind numbing, dumb head, one ata time rotate the
engine in reverse method. Been doin it that way for 38 years, can't stop now.

For those in the L.A. area, I'm planning to go to the Summer Jam in San Pedro
this Saturday. See the listing on The Samba.
