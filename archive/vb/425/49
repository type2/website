Ah, that makes sense...
 I always though that if the heads were not stained dark that was a sign of a
well kept motor.
Thanks for articulating why that would be.

Like seasoning cooking oil onto cast iron cookware, you can and will
cook the oil onto the heads in a brown layer. If your heads stay nice
and shiny aluminum color you are keeping the oil temp lower than the
thermal break down temp point of oil.
