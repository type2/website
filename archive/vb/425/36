Subject: New Muir "Idiot Guide" BUS T-Shirt

Thought this might interest the list ...  Through an arrangement with the
estate of Peter Aschwanden, the illustrator of John Muir's "How To Keep Your
Volkswagen Alive," we now have a tee shirt featuring a rare Bus print that
never made it into the U.S. edition of the book. This shirt with the front
Bus graphic is only available at the Depot. Sizes S to XXL.
