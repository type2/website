Subject: Seattle area list members

Thought I'd forward the following invite from the WetWesties list, in case
any Seattle area listees who don't also subscribe to WetWesties would like
to join us Saturday night...

To recap, at the end of May my wife and I made arrangements with a list
member to trade some parts for the use of her Vanagon on a trip down the
coastline from Seattle to San Fransisco. Shortly thereafter I posted here
asking for "must-see" suggestions for our trip, and literally got dozens of
emails. Linda and I found them incredibly useful, and put many of them on
our itinerary.

Fast forward to last weekend ... Just days before we were to fly out (with
nonrefundable airline tickets), we learned that the Westy would not be
ready. Before settling for (gasp!) a boring rental car and some hotel rooms,
I decided to post here once again, asking if anyone else was interested in
trading the use of their Westy for a parts credit. I figured it was a long
shot, but what the heck. Once again, the response was amazing!  A dozen list
members from Sacramento to Canada replied, offering everything from their
campers to a guest room on the way if we ended up using a rental car. Within
days - and not a moment too soon!  we were able to work something out with
another list member, and are back on track.

I never cease to be amazed at the overwhelming kindness of the Bus/Vanagon
community. It's what has always made running the Depot so rewarding.  Had it
not been for all of your advice, and the last minute offers as well, our
upcoming vacation would have been much less exciting.  I'd like to thank all
of you for your kindness, and hopefully even have the chance to thank some
of you "in person" when we reach Seattle. We'll be in downtown Seattle
Saturday night, as we pick up the Westy there Sunday morning. After emailing
a couple of list members, we have settled on the 5 Point Cafi -
www.the5pointcafe.com . If anyone is in the area and would like to join us
for a drink or two, let's say around 7:30 pm?

Again, for those who can't join us, thanks for all your suggestions and
advice for our trip!
