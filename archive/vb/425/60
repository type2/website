Bob -

Both relays are located on a plastic plug-in plate which is part of the Fuse
Box Assembly.  In fact, the Fuse Box/Relay Plate assembly for the 73-later
Stupid Beetle is the same as 75-79 Buses.  The Headlight Relay is a silver
cube with 5 terminals (111 941 583 or 411 941 583 B or C).  The flasher
relay for BOTH the turn signals and hazard lights is a black cube with 3
terminals (111 953 227 A or D, now sold as 191 953 227 A or B).

BTW, there is no such thing as a "relay switch".  It's either one or the
other ;)  Yes, technically it does switch circuits, but calling it a relay
switch confuses most auto electricians.
