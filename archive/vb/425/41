Subject: Re: [T2] Quiet down your bus

One more item on my quiet quest.
I upholstered the front door panels with 1/2" thick rebond memory foam 
carpet padding and a nice grey automotive upholstery fabric. As it is a 
delivery bus, I used one size larger SS pan head screws to mount the panels. 
Looks nice.
I'll put some photos onto my PhotoBucket account when I get a chance. Will 
post the link.

Since I have a kamper, I am guessing that a lot of the noise is due to the 
wood paneling picking up the vibrations and amplifying them. I may go back 
at some point and put Damplifier on the inner sides of panels. A soft 
surface tends to absorb noise, a hard surface reflects.

Chris,

Did you use it in a bus?

If so, what did you cover/coat?

Cheers,
   Tom
