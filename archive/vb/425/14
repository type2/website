Hi,
Will send pics or post them.

My unit is from Kamper Kits in Cupertino, CA. (no longer in business as far as
I know)
The nice feature of this renditions is the slightly narrower closet on the
passenger side. This allows for sliding in a 4x8 sheet of material. Did this
many times over the years when it was my daily driver. Alas, I notice you have
a 61 which has the small rear hatch. No problem, you can adapt.

The layout was pretty standard similar to sundials, rivieras, Westphalias and
others. Fridge/ice box next to the passenger side door behind the non-walkthru
bulkhead. beside that was a rear facing seat with storage underneath that held
a 10 gallon water tank. Fold down front facing seat. Closet on passenger side.
Jelousie windows in all doors and one behind the driver side doors, 5 total.

BTW I'm missing the fridge and adjacent storage seat.
