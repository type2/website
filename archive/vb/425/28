Subject: re:Kamper Kit (tent)

Hey Chris,

 

Nice side tent. I think I have the same one. Mine has never been used. The
PO gave it to me, and said he couldn't figure out how to set it up, and it
had been in storage since '65.

 

At one point I think I figured it out, but realized I was missing some
poles, and planned on having the fabricated for me, or using electrical
conduit.

 

One thing -  I could not figure out how to hook it up, and keep the roof
rack on. It looks like you were able to do both. I remember with mine that
the posts somehow were interfered with by my roof rack. As I preferred
having the roof rack, I never pursued setting this up. But I may try this
year to figure it out, as I'm not sure if I'm putting the roof rack back on.
So do you have more pics of this set up?

 

Thanks.

 

Another note for John.I am not working on a double door, but have done a lot
of work on my ez-camper. If you go to the vintagebus website by Thom, and
look into the tech info site, you can see some drawings I made a few years
ago of how to put the different parts together.

 

As I'm putting my bus back together again, and want to rebuild some more
panels this time, I'll try to do more drawings of more parts ad I go.

The side tent is slightly larger than the one that was with my bus, however
the exact same canvas.
