Hi Clara,

Can you explain what you mean by:

 "Another thing to think about is you want it not too hot and not too cold.
But
juuuusst right. I ran one of those smaller generator pulleys once, and the
engine was too
cold.  I went back to a stock generator pulley.
 The oil temps barely got to 170F after an hour on the freeway.  and dropped
down from there when I went to the surface streets.  it was April."

I understand that if the engine is too hot-the oil may not lubricate
properly, could smoke, could cause metal to distort, and really shorten a
drive. But how could it be a problem if the temp is too cold? Are you saying
170 after an hour on the freeway is too cold (ie that was with the smaller
generator pulleys)? What is the range the oil should be out of before I
should be concerned?
