Hi Kevin,
Oil pressure is definitely #1.  If you are running to hot of temp the
oil pressure will also go down.

Oil temp, and head temp would be next.

Voltage so you can tell if you are having electrical trouble before it
leaves you stranded.  Have had loose connections cause voltage loss,
and a regulator go bad causing voltage sudddenly up over 16 volts!

In our buses have been installing a three gauge holder where the dash
ash tray was, so no need for drilling holes.  Plus passenger can help
by keeping eye on these gauges for any bad changes.

Under the dash package tray just to right of speedo, have air fuel, and
head temp gauges.
