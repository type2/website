Thanks Gary for reminding me about the bushing. I have a 6V starter in my 
bus with a custom brass bushing. Guess I need another bushing unless I can 
swap in my 6V starter too. Anyone know?

What about the installation? Does the 71 have a removeable skirt like my 
split so the engine goes straight in? Or do I have to lift the bus and slide 
the motor under and then up? Or not lift the bus and install the fan housing 
after the motor is underneath (not easy I presume).

Thanks,
Chris
