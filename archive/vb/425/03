So, are you driving it yet?

I bought 100sq ft of Fatmat sound deadening, which looks a lot like the stuff
you used in your EZ camper.

This is for my 66 kombi, which is a rattley empty tin box.   I have installed
about half the sound deadening, and not noticed a huge difference when
driving.     It is more that well yes, it might be a bit quieter, maybe.   See
what I mean?
When I knock on the bus, it does sound more of a thud that a ting ting ting,
though.


Oh well, when I get an interior in it I am sure it will be quieter.
 Finally got the cab roof directional vane seals ordered, can install the cab
roof panels when those are in.
