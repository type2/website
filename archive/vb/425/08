with hackage (depending on what kit and what cabinets you're using), it'll 
work.

Jeff Power in the Daytona Beach FL area is building a custom SO-22/23/33 
(early mosaic) style interior as well - I've seen them and they're NICE.

Some pictures here:

And you can contact him through thesamba.  Feel free to tell him I sent 
you. :)

Last time I saw a price it was pretty damn reasonable considering a) what 
early buses cost these days, and b) how much work it takes to make -any- 
camper interior for a bus work if it wasn't stock. :)
