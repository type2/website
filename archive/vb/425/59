You do not want your engine too hot, or too cold.  I think Eric& Barb
articulated well reasons to not have it run cold.
For example, How much is the oil going to lubricate at 80 F?   Not a whole
lot.  Not like it should, not like it will at 180F


The funny thing is people talk about too hot more than too cold.  But you
gotta think about both, as both extremes will damge the motor, which is why
you want it to get up to temp as soon as possible.
Install all the tins and seals and thermostat set up.
 The people who designed the motor meant them to be there, and they thought
about temperature and such things.
