Subject: SO-23 tent poles

Hi everyone,
 
I have been lucky and aquired what i believe to be a SO23 tent with
awning/privy, the kind that attaches to the bumpers of the bus(camper). Anyway
I have a 67 westy and would LOVE to use this but its missing the poles. I have
a lead and think they are being repopped by BBT and am looking in to
purchasing a set. I thought I would ask here first if anyone has a set to sell
or knows of any other sources for the poles. I am very stoked about the canvas
and cannot wait to use it. Any info would help!!!
 
TIA,
 
Ken
