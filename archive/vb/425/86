2. No, pre-1968 starter bushing has larger OD.

4.  Yes, if you take a 1968-70 bus only front tin and cut off the bus=20
only adapter pieces on it and weld it to your front DH tin.

5.  No.  Pre-1971 clutch pressure plate used matching later TO
bearing=20
and arm.  Use earlier PP with later bearing and TO arm and bad things=20
happen.....
