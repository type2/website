Subject: 71 bus, Huntington Bch, CA

Hi,

Just took a look at a 71 bus for sale. the only real rust is at the base of
the windshield. Several holes. Owner is in need of moving the vehicle. Price
is right. He is installing an engine. New brakes and master cylinder. Most of
the parts are there including the back seat. Middle seat is missing. Minor
sheet metal damage around left tail light. I would say a great deal at the
asking price if you are willing to put in a little work.
