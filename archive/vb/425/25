Sad story on the  missing components.
Around 1979 the ice box was rather rotted out. The water tank had rusted 
thru. The linoleum was worn out. Soooo, off I went one day and ripped out 
the seat and the ice box cabinets and put in carpet on the floor and padding 
with carpet on the non walk thru bulkhead. The tent sat in my Dad's garage 
for years and one day he asked if I wanted it to which I said dump it. There 
you go. As Homer says, "DOH".

64 DD Kamper, What's left.
Anyone have a spare seat and ice box cabinet with a side tent?

 I've had the bus since 1972 when the original owner, my Dad, gave me the
 bus. So I know the history of this one. Went kamping in it when I was a 
kid.

Oh! So what happened to the missing components?
