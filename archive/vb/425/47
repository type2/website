Hi Volks,
Personally we like to keep oil temp below 220 F.  Got to remember that
the oil going to the rockers inside the valve covers on the heads is
going to get much hotter than the oil collected at the sump.
Like seasoning cooking oil onto cast iron cookware, you can and will
cook the oil onto the heads in a brown layer.  If your heads stay nice
and shiny aluminum color you are keeping the oil temp lower than the
thermal break down temp point of oil.

too hot anyway.

Right. Thermal breakdown is about 265 to 280 (ask me how I know! :-)
