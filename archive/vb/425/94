Subject: Rear Drivers Side (left) Wheel locked up.

I was driving my 61 RHD DD Panel down a typical city road. I noticed my
brakes we failing....then out of the blue..
my left rear drivers Side flys off.  No one was hurt.

What could it be?
*Brakes locked up
*Wheel bearing
*RGB failed?

If it was the RGB how do you fix something like that?
