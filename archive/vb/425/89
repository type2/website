Subject: braking issues.

had a massive break failure recently.  Looks like I will be able to get the
parts, though.

Q:  I never use the emergency  brakes on my bus (59 single cab).  the damaged
brake side e-cable was broken.  Could I "get by" with just the opposite side
e-brake only or is this, as I might suspect, a bad idea?
