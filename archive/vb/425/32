Subject: gauges

Hi All,

 

I have been thinking about adding some temperature gauges to my '69, and
maybe in the future to my '65. I currently only have a tach in the '69.
Based on what I have read on the list, a Cylinder Head Temperature Gauge is
better to have than an oil temp gauge. I have seen some online that appear
to get installed under/with the #3 sparkplug

some that look like they actually go into the engine block -

It sounds like the one that attaches to the spark plug is much easier to
install, is there a down side to using this type? 

 

I see there are volt and amp gauges, why would you want one of these? 

 

I guess a more basic question-after looking at stuff available online - I
would think the following would help monitor engine health the best: oil
temp, oil pressure, cylinder head temp, but this seems like overkill, do
these basically overlap in their information, and what range should I be
looking at for the gauges?

 

Also where and how do you guys mount your gauges?  The PO just drilled a
hole in the dash for the tach, my dash is pretty beat up, but I'd rather not
drill another hole in it.

 

Thanks for any tips.
