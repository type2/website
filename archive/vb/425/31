Hey Ken

No the splash pan doesn't get it the way.   I am saying you NEED the splash
pan. gotta have it
Otherwise the weight of the poles/canvas tilts the bumepr end down.   I saw a
pic of that, and it looked kinda silly.
Just in case your bumper was incomplete, might want to sort it out.

FWIW Greg installed tent mounts last week on my 66 kombi:

If you install the roof mounts slightly too close together it is fine, but if
they are too far apart it will be a problem to install the pole that fits
along the side of the bus there.

I have drilled a few rear bumpers to make it possible to hang a tent.   :)

Clara, no mounts on roof or bumper. cip1 is out of stock but some rep thru bbt
set me up w/cb performance? anyway they didnt want to sell only the poles and
hardware but the rep talked them into it so for 279+shipping i should be
hooked up. i understand i will need to make the privy poles. i will review the
forum discussion on the rear bumper splash pan issue later when i have more
time but just to recap are you saying the splashpan gets in the way of the
mounting pole???

Yes, the poles have been re-popped by I think it was BBT.  The repro poles can
be used with a original awning.  I don't believe they include the spears for
the privey section of the tent.
Does your 67 have the mounts on the roof and front bumper?
The green/white 65 westy I have did have the roof & bumper mounts for the
striped tent, but it seems only the German delivered SO-42s did.
 Most SO-42s came with the big top tent that attaches to the rain gutter.

You do really want to have a splash pan in the rear bumper on the passenger
side before setting up he side tent.

Hi everyone,

 have been lucky and aquired what i believe to be a SO23 tent with
wning/privy, the kind that attaches to the bumpers of the bus(camper). Anyway
 have a 67 westy and would LOVE to use this but its missing the poles. I have
 lead and think they are being repopped by BBT and am looking in to
urchasing a set. I thought I would ask here first if anyone has a set to sell
r knows of any other sources for the poles. I am very stoked about the canvas
nd cannot wait to use it. Any info would help!!!

IA,
