The '71 has a removable panel, the last year for it.  Darn it.

What about the installation? Does the 71 have a removeable skirt like my 
split so the engine goes straight in? Or do I have to lift the bus and slide

the motor under and then up? Or not lift the bus and install the fan housing

after the motor is underneath (not easy I presume).

Thanks,
Chris
