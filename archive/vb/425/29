Thanks Kevin,

On my bus there were 2 brackets screwed onto the roof onto which the tent
frame hooked. There was also a support pole at each end that had a short small
rod (1/4" dia) that engaged a hole in the front and rear bumpers. In the
linked photo, you can see the diagonal support engaging the front bumper. Oh
yeah, the tent framing was built from EMT. Some pieces welded and others
hooked together with fittings you can get at the Depot.

  The side tent is slightly larger than the one that was with my bus, however
the exact same canvas.
