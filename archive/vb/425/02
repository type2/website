Subject: Schaub Lorenz Kofferradio

Hello, John!

After reading your message, I went to my wardrobe , took out my old
Telefunken " Kofferradio", waltzed over to my Kombi, connected its battery
and inserted the radio into its cradle mounted under the cubbyhole...

...and it came to life pronto!

yes, these types of radios were all the rage in the 60's and early 70's and
mine was brand new on occasion for the trip from CH to Turkey and
Afghanistan....

...and it still plays here in South Africa!

Schaub Lorenzes were made in Rastatt, southern Germany, Grundigs were made
in Fuerth, Telefunkens somewhere in the german midlands and Loewes ( Opta)
were made in or near Bremen, originally in ( west ) Berlin. Blaupunkts came
from Hildesheim.

Fond greetings from a winterly cold Johannesburg!
