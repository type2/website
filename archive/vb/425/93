On a 59 if you have only one brake cable the e-brake does not work.

 Nil.
Zilch.
Nada

This is the case through VIN 501 xxx when the changed the hand brake lever
further forward.

What, you never park on a slope?   I parked on a slope today in my splitty
when I took the cat to the vet for her shots.   I pulled the e-brake when I
parked.   You should have the option, instead of driving around looking for a
flat parking spot with a complaining animal in the bus with you.

Maybe you carry a brick with for a e-brake?

Just buy a second e-brake cable, and install it already.
