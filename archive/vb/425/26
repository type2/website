Well, the thing about it was that in 1979 the camper was only 15 years
old. When a vehicle is at that stage, we don't look at them as
collectible, but rather as old. So we are more prone to toss things
that are worn out or seem not to be useful.

 Around 1979 the ice box was rather rotted out. The water tank had rusted
 thru. The linoleum was worn out. Soooo, off I went one day and ripped out
 the seat and the ice box cabinets and put in carpet on the floor and padding
 with carpet on the non walk thru bulkhead. The tent sat in my Dad's garage
 for years and one day he asked if I wanted it to which I said dump it. There
 you go. As Homer says, "DOH".
