Subject: Tour de France bus sighting - stage 9

Major bus sighting in stage 9 of the tour. If you don't have access on 
TV you can see it at versus.com. Go to 22.7 miles from the end of stage 
9 and as you enjoy watching Andy Schleck give Alberto Contador hell, 
you'll see behind them parked along the side of the road a Red/White 
Sub-Hatch Westy, a Westy with the small pop-up top (don't know which 
model), a Highroof with the sales counter side with the side open, and a 
Dove Blue Crewcab with the canvas on back lifted up to provide shade for 
the lucky owner to sit under as the bikes went by. These were some nice 
looking buses out for a day at the race.
