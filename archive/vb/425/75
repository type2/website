Subject: VW bus brake disaster.

From: "Hauck, William (DLI)" <William.Hauck(-at-)state.mn.us>

I have a 59 single cab that suffered major brake disaster the other night.

Long story short: Complete loss of all brake components on driver's side
rear.  Question:  Are big nut backing plates the same as small nut backing
plates??  Anyone have a small nut backing plate and reduction box half
(somewhat damaged also)?
