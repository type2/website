Subject: re:gauges

Well, I think I have come up with a plan based on your feedback, and = some
web reading.

Gauges are good, learn how to read them, pay attention to them=85
Recommendations of gauges in order of importance, seems to be:
1. Oil Pressure
2. Oil Temp
3. Cylinder Head Temp

I already have a tach now (by PO) and I found a an oil temp gauge I = bought
a long time ago-for another vehicle, but never installed. So I picked up =
an oil pressure gauge. I also found a 3 gauge trim panel, that should fit
nicely between the radio and ashtray. So hopefully I'll have a 3 gauge =
panel installed, and will be able to monitor the health of my engine better.
= If it works out well, I think I'll try to do something similar for my '65.

Thanks, and I'll let you know how the install goes
