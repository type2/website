Hi MJ,
Did the lug bolts fall out, shear off, or the holes in the rim torn
out??

If they fell out, that might have been your only problem.

If one or both of the latter two you could have seized brake, RGB
bearings/gears blown to pieces, or even your transaxle went.

As for the brakes going that could either just be a coincidence that
they happened just before the wheel flew off, or the brakes in the drum
were failing and locked up.

As of right now you have three possible problems.

Would start with removal of the brake drum and see if anything is amiss
in there.
E&B
