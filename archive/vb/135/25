Subject: Tight valves after our trip


Hope everyone enjoyed a happy and safe 4th! We took the Greyhounds
camping over the weekend. 3 hour drive to wilderness, just great.
Splitty took it all wonderfully, even the 23miles on dirt roads...man,
gotta clean the engine compartment now! The stupid blue wires pulled off
the dizzy for coil, casuing a bad miss, but found that fast. Staying put
now...Gotta find OE wires...
Well, trip home was slightly different. I found my valves tight when I
pulled close to home, at idle, and confirmed the next morning.
3 exhaust, perfect, 3 intake perfect 4 exhaust perfect (.006 that is) 4
intake tight, at like .002-003, all of pass side head, interference
tight! Re lashed, drove like 15 miles, and pass side head sounds noisy
again.....

Motor now has 1500 miles on her, just changed oil, will be re-lashing
tonight on stone cold motor, same as yesterday.


What should I look for , in the case this is a result of another
problem? Or might two adjustments be the ticket>? Im conserned about
this, and motor 1 year anniversary (and complete lack of help from the
builder, with which I am disapointed with to begin with) will occur on
August 16th, so I want to isolate any problems ASAP.
