Subject: Wiring an ammeter guage

Does anyone have some insight into wiring this guage.  I'm having a hell of
a time  with it.  I tried running a 10 guage wire brom the B+ terminal on
the alternator to the B+ terminal on the guage and then running the wire
back from the L+ terminal on the guage to the positive post on the battery.
Doesn't seem to work.  Any insight would be appreciated.  Thanks.
