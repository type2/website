does anyone know if it is safe to run an external oil cooler with a =
stock oil pump that is properly blocked off?  i have a high volume pump, =
but with the pump cover on i cant get a pulley to clear it.  i have =
tried a stock, empi, and scat pulley and none of them will clear the =
nuts that hold the full flow cover on.  i cant put my studs in any =
further, so i wanna try it with a stock pump.  i have been told it can =
be done safely, but would like other opinions as well.  thanks!
