From that description, I would agree.  If you can feel this connection
getting hot -- it gets a little warm anyway from the filament but if
it's really hot where the wire goes into the copper connector -- then
that's another clue.

Very likely.

What you might do is pull the wires out of the connectors you have,
buy some push-on sockets, and crimp or solder them directly on to the
wires.  You won't have the little plastic piece to hold all 3 connectors
together, so you'll have to pay attention when you change a burned-out
headlight in the future.  Do note that the headlight lugs are wider
than the standard 0.25" push-on connector - you can get wider push-ons
but you might have to look around a bit for them.

You can still get a ready-made headlamp connector with wires, like the
one in the Bentley, and splice the connector wires to the Bus wires.
Putting the separate push-ons on the Bus wires may help avoid a little
extra voltage drop, but if the current connector is making poor contact,
anything might be an improvement.

My '64 (built November 1963) is like this too.  On page E-4 1 of the
Bentley, it mentions that Buses with 1500 engines had the separately
mounted regulator, and implies this was happening at least as early
as 5 May 1964.  Doliwa says the 200 W generator with separate regulator
started on 7 January 1963 and doesn't make any 1200/1500 distinctions.
