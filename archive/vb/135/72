Subject: 67 bug to bus tranny swap

hi all,
> In searching for a '67 swing axle tranny core, a local merchant claimed that I
could use the swing axle from a bug
> (he has a rebuilt ready to roll!) if i switched the nosecones and swapped the
shift rod with the hockey stick bus
> type.  Does anyone know if this is possible?  Has anyone done it with
success/problems?  The gear ratios look good,
> and the physical sizes match.  I'm also a bit perplexed about the 4 reverse
gears issue, as I am totally unfamiliar
> with bugs...clarification here would be appreciated as I would hate to make
that mistake!!
> By the way, my reduction boxes are removed, and axles are in good shape; just
need to swap out the centers.
> thanks in advance, and happy driving.
