Is faster always better?  I don't think so. What about over speeding the
generator bearings and fan?  Do you now need to weld up and balance the fan?

As Ronnie mentioned clearance is a problem and don't forget that you
will need more power from your motor to push the bigger pulley. Not much
I'm sure, but my 1600 only has about 60 to start with...I need it all.
Remember going up a hill on your "ten" speed trying to push the big
front crank??  Takes more ommph.
