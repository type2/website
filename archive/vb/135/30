Subject: Westfalia hitch For Sale, make offer or trade.

I have an original Split Screen Westfalia tow hitch on
its way from overseas.  I am not sure of the mfg date
but do know that it is a post Barn Door unit.  I do
not have pictures right now as it is still overseas. 
I will have it in hand next month.  Anyone interested?
 Make me an offer.  I will also consiter trades.  I
will post in on the VW planet the end of the week.

It is complete minus the electrical parts and the
bolts to mount to the underside of the bumper.  It is
used, not NOS.

Thanks
Matthew
