Subject: Re: [VB] oil pump question

I had the same problem with mine when I installed an
external oil filter. I took my degree pulley to a
local machine shop and had the back side of the pulley
machined down as thin as they could get it. Put it
back on and it cleared the engine tin after that. Hope
that helps.
