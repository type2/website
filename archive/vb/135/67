Subject: Safari wiper shaft's

Anyone have a set of pre 65 safari wiper shafts they
want to trade?  I have a set of NOS 65-67 SWF shafts
that i would like to trade or sell to get a pair of
early shafts.

Let me know if anyone is interested.  I value the SWF
ones about the same as a good pair of early ones.

Thanks
Matthew
