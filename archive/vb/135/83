hey all,

I want to beef up the brake system on my 65 crew . I exploded a front wheel
cylinder last week . And they where also fairly new parts too.
my brakes have always been kinda cheesy and I want to update it to disc 
brakes and also a dual system master cylinder.

has any one done this and have any suggestions.  I want strong brakes 
I also wonder if changing  the front beam could improve the handling ?
any one sell cost effective aftermarket kits ?  who is the best ? 

any suggestions would be helpful
Thanks John
