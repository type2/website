<< does anyone know if it is safe to run an external oil cooler with a stock 
oil pump that is properly blocked off?  i have a high volume pump, but with 
the pump cover on i cant get a pulley to clear it.  i have tried a stock, 
empi, and scat pulley and none of them will clear the nuts that hold the full 
flow cover on.  i cant put my studs in any further, so i wanna try it with a 
stock pump.  i have been told it can be done safely, but would like other 
opinions as well.  thanks!

Is it the nuts that are pushing the tin out from the case which then hits the 
pulley?   Or is it the studs sticking through the nuts?   You can grind off 
the end of the studs and that'll clearance it enough.  BTDT. I think you only 
need to grind down two of the studs. 
better to have a heavier oil pump if you are going to run a cooler and/or 
filter.
