Two flasher relays?  Originally your Bus would have had just a 9-prong
box.  It may have been replaced by the "two relays on a board" thing
that some vendors sell as a replacement.

The switches on the master cylinder are working, then.

I would generally agree with that.  The brake light power has to go
through the turn signal switch to get to the rear, so the problem
probably lies in the turn signal switch, or possibly in the flasher
relay.

You might want to look at the wiring diagram for your Bus at
http://www.vintagebus.com/wiring/bus-66-usa.jpg while trying to
figure this out.

First, find the black/purple stripe wire at the turn signal switch.
There will probably be two; you want the one that is _not_ plugged
into a black/white stripe wire.  Hook up your test light between
that wire and ground, and step on the brakes.  If the test light
comes on, you know the brake light signal is making it to the turn
signal switch - if it doesn't, then you've got a broken wire between
the flasher and the turn signal switch.

Next, unplug both black/purple stripe wires and the black/yellow
stripe wire at the turn signal switch and temporarily connect them
all together - use a clothespin or a pair of pliers to hold all the
terminal ends together, something like that.  Step on the brakes
and see if the brake lights come on.  If they do, the wiring from
the turn signal switch to the back is OK, but if not, that wiring
is incorrect in some way.

If everything checks out OK, probably the next step is to compare
the turn signal switch wiring to the wiring diagram and see if
it matches.  Trace out the wires that come from the turn signal
switch and make sure they go to the places the wiring diagram
say they should go.

If that all seems OK, it may be in the wiring to the flasher relay.
Again, originally you would have had a 9-prong box, but it may have
been replaced.  

Did the brake lights and turn signals work before you replaced the
harness?  If they did, then probably something just got hooked back
up wrong when it went back together.

That sounds like a short to ground - the flasher is switching on and
off very quickly making the noise you hear.  Again, incorrect wiring
at the flasher relay or at the turn signal switch is the likely
culprit.  If you get the brake lights working, this problem may solve
itself.
