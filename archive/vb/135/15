Good for you george =)
Glad to hear you straitened things out.
Question:
Where did you get the stud installer/socket 
that mated to the torque wrench?
I mean to add a 8 mm and 10 mm stud installer 
to my tool collection.
I've never seen them at Sears...
Do I have to flag down a Snap-On truck?
Aloha
