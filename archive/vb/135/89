Subject: wheel bolt torque note

Hi,

Sorry for re-hashing this thread but I thought it was interesting...

I was going through some old parts and saw this note printed on a bright 
yellow sticker on the inside of a Type III glove compartment door:

"When you change a wheel make sure that the bolts are really tight. The 
torque should be 110 ft. lbs. Have it checked with a torque wrench at a 
service station."
