Hi Russ,
Only if you cut off the nose and foraward floor of the bus.  We did this on a 
wasted 1960 to remove the rear shift linkage in one piece with the forward 
coupler rusted into it for our 1960 walk thru camper converted panel.  It 
only took three hours to heat and twist the forward coupler from the rear 
shift linkage!  Hopefully you can save you forward shift linkage!
