Subject:  Web site for trade!! for a BUS!!

Received this E-Mail from a friend of mine--Vantastic Bus person--Is there
any help out there??

Here is the contact  Robert at  topdawg(-at-)topdawg.net


jerry hi, I am going to put up my web site vwclubs.us or vwclubs.com for
sale or trade for a half way descent type II that runs and drives.
I will trade one for that and both for a nice one if you could let your vw
list of people know I really miss driving a single cab or hell any bus.
thanks Robert
