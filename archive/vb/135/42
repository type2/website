Subject: Check Generator Output

Hello all

My red light has come on.  How or where can I check the generator output(
with a volt meter) to see if the problem is the Generator or Regulator.
This is on a 67, 12v system.  I have checked both books that I own, and I
found nothing.  (I have John Muirs 2001 edition and another)

Thanks

Bob
