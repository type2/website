Subject: Re: [VB] RE:Lights on the fritz

I take it the lights at the back of the bus dont respond.  It sounded like 
the brake switch worked, as it made a light go on when you try at the switch. 
  So work backward.  open the engine lid and see if there is electricity at 
the wires to the taillights   SOmetimes a bulb has a bad connection or a bad 
ground.

Still no light?  use a wiring diagram to follow to the source - the front end 
of those wires is near the fuse box.  Something is misconnected or funky,. so 
just use a wiring diagram and patiently follow the path from taillights to 
where it is hot.  Is your wiring diagram the same as the VW one?   is the new 
wiring harness properly colour coded?

FWIW I have found turn sigs (66-67) switch that use various coloured wires.  
SOme use purple, some don't. 

With 66/67 wiring but I think the brake lights are routed through the black 
box
