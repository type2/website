Good for you Conrad!   I wish more people still kept this philosophy when
trading bus parts.  Some of the used parts I see floating around FS are
crazy ridiculous prices!  These higher used parts prices will only lead to
the destruction of more busses because people cannot afford to keep them on
the road.

I do not mind paying a premium at a used parts business (they need to eat
and stay in business with a profit), but individual sellers sometimes fall
into the "greedy rat bastard" category.  Example:  Old man decides he cannot
turn wrenches anymore, sells stuff to kid for $5, kid goes on e-bay and
sells for $500 = rat bastard.  (Porsche parts are looking like a good deal
compared to some of the JUNK being sold for VWs)
