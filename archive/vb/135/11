Subject: hesitation/stalling at full throttle

Wondering if anyone has any clues about this:
009 distributor (i know, i know) 30-pict carb, 1600 sp motor
If I step on the gas hard, like try to go from idle to full throttle, the
motor stumbles, hesitates, sometimes even stalls.  If I push the gas slowly
and smoothly, it's fine.  Changing the fuel mixture has no effect.  Neither
does adjusting the timing.  This is a huge PITA driving in traffic.

I think you're all going to say to get rid of the 009, but what is causing
this?  It never used to have this problem.

TIA,
Diana
