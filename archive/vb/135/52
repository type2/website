Subject: FS: one slightly used sunroof bow

Hi,

I tried to sell a front bug vent window on eBay. Didn't sell. But I did 
get a nice email from a gentleman down the road, and since I had to go 
to Dallas anyways, he invited me to stop by on the way up.

Turns out, the vent window wasn't worth anything - but he was willing to 
trade me some 'useless' parts. One of them, he said, was used to 
reinforce the front bumper on the 64 Bug he had bought.

Hmmm... Looks an awful like a bus sunroof bow. He said I could have it, 
what the heck. Also tossed in a slightly used front spare tire holder. 
That was the best part of my day!

Now, unlike my friends in Oregon who like to sell parts at NYC prices, 
this header bow needs to find a good home for a cheap price - if you 
need it, email me. Point me to your project picture in the 
VintageBus.com gallery.

If you are collecting parts to trade for gold and other commodities, 
forget it. And yes, I've already gotten the lecture on the subject...so 
don't bother.

Thanks,
Conrad
