Removed as in currently out of the bus, or removed as in "the bus has a
straight-axle kit installed and doesnt need redux boxes anymore?"

IF your bus still uses redux boxes, you cant use the bug transaxle unless
you (or the guy who wants to sell it to you..) flips the ring gear inside
the transmission.  If you use a bug transmission and redux boxes you'll be
able to cruise nicely at 60mph in reverse, once you've shifted through to
R4... :)

IF you have a straight axle kit, then most likely you can use a bug
transaxle. Most of those conversions use bug centers. (and you wont have
to flip anything...)
