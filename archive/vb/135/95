Subject: RE: Trade web-site for a VW Bus--Contd.--

hahaha that's funny if only knew that as long as he or she does not put the
vw trade mark and if he or she would read the disclaimer at the bottom of
the page Volkswagen of America can't do a thing about the sites I was sent
the famous e-mail from their hot shot lawyer and I responded in a nice way
to take a flying leap and bring it on . I explained to her that it has
nothing to do exactly with the "Volkswagen make" but the community of people
that love those types of cars and if anything we are their biggest
advertiser for them it was some new lawyer with Volkswagen of America trying
to make a name for herself ... tell him thank you for the advise but I have
been there done that already and I'm still here tell him to go to
http://www.netsol.com do a who is lookup o the site vwclubs.com and see how
long I have had it.... thanks jerry....Robert

Jerry, please, with all respect, this guy is a sitting duck with domain
names like that because of VWOA. Nobody would trade two dead flies for
them...
