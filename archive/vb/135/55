Hello there.  First time on this list... hoping to get some hints and =
support.

Background:
We (my father-in-law and I) own, and are attempting to restore, a 1967 =
'Splittie' VW Bus.  Piece by piece we are getting the old girl back to =
as original as possible.

My particular interest of the day is to bring back to life a radio that =
was in the Bus when we saved it from certain doom (rusting away in a car =
lot).  What I am working with is a Blauplunkt AM radio with the =
following markings:
A sticker that has...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Wolfsburg III    Blauplunkt
7 638 061        WERKE GMBH
                      C 3962679
                      Made in Germany =20
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ =20
And pressed into the metal chassis...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(VW) 111.035.101 B
BLAUPLUNKT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased an antenna from Wolfsburg West =
(http://www.wolfsburgwest.com/cgi-bin/wwshowpn.cgi?PN=3DZVW6) that I =
matched from the partial one I removed from the BUS.  The antenna cable =
fits perfectly into the back of the radio.

What I am looking for in particular is the wiring harness that plugs =
into the back of the radio for power and speakers.  The rear of the =
radio has a round connector and room for 6 wires + one that looks like a =
ground wire that would contact the outer part of the connector.

Can someone help me?  If further clarification is required, I have =
pictures of just about every angle as well as the internals of the =
radio.

Please help and thanks for your time,
Greg
