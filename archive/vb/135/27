Subject: RE: [VB] center pin shift rod hell

wow, that shift rod coupler is always in the lime light.  You can tell if
your bus uses the short front shift rod (early) if the shifter is close
(2inches or so) from the front seat pedestal.  The later ones have the
shifter about 6 inches from the front seat pedestal.  If you mangled yours,
make sure you save the pieces.  Repop couplers can be found at any of the
major places (WW, wolfgang, bfy, etc) but the rods are more difficult so
you're best bet might be to go to a machine shop and have them repaired.


Good luck

was writ:
This weekend I worked on getting my front beam out to
replace the center pin/swing lever bushings.
Everything was going smoothly until it came time to
take out the front shift rod. Snapped the screw heads
off the coupler in about 2 seconds each. Drilled them
out, but still no dice. Pulled out the angle grinder
and ground away half of the coupler, still no dice.
won't even be twisted. So now i guess I'm down to
cutting it. I'm sure I've mangled the Front shift rod,
and I'm worried about the rear one... My question: Is
it possible to pull the rear shift rod out the front,
therby avoiding pulling the engine and tranny? Boy, I
sure hope so.
Also, I know there were some changes to the front
shift rod, but will any year rear shift rod do the
trick? My bus is a later '60. Thanks, y'all.
