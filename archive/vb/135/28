Subject: Gas heater rebuilder Wanted

A friend of mine is looking for someone to rebuild his
Gas heater.  I do not know too many details but what i
do know is it is an original Espacher (SP?) heater out
of an all original 58 Westfalia camper.  He uses his
camper extensively and needs heat for an upcoming trip
back east.  (Paul Goodrich from Hawaii, he was at Red
Barn & KP with his camper)  He is looking for someone
to rebuild it in the next month.  The heater last ran
about a year ago but no longer wants to fire up.  

anyone know someone who knows how to work on these? 
Someone who has done one before?

Thanks
Matthew
