In order to reduce glare in this way, the eyebrows would have to be long
enough to come between the entire headlight and the oncoming traffic!
Figure on about 3-6 feet long!  The 2-inch long eyebrows commonly used
only cut glare for aircraft flying low overhead.

If your european-spec H4 headlights are properly aimed, they will have far
less glare than US-spec sealed beams, since the lens and reflector of the
H4 lights are better made than those of sealed-beam lights.  No need for
add-ons like eyebrows.
