HI!
i am now ready to begin work on my 58, first off i need a new complete 
engine. i would prefer something a more powerfull than stock, but whatever 
comes my way at teh right time (and at the right price) is what ill get. id 
definatly prefer a complete engine, but if it is missing some perifrials (ie 
carb, coil, alternator, etc) thats ok too. 
thanks!
