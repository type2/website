Subject: re: [VW] emblem~ the REAL history behind it.

Who invented the emblem?

I made a few educated guesses privately to Doug so as
to not steal anyone's fun.

Publically, I'd guess that it was someone's wife or
three legged dog who claimed the ability to draw. As a
long time freelance commecial artist <1980-1995> I
constantly was reminded that my efforts to design the
nicest, finest product possible was a moot effort.
Many  times it boiled down to a tasteless commitee of
morons, accountants and engineers; someone's
wife/girlfriend in a hormonal mood; or someone related
to the purse strings who had a three legged-dog who
claimed the ability to draw.
Me thinks that at sometime somewhere there was a
series of wonderfully designed and executed proposal
options to the logo that we all now know and love. I
can see a cigar chomping type A personality getting
frustrated in a meeting and standing up at the head of
the table and exploding in anger saying "If we can't
make up our minds then why don't we just stack a
stupid V on top of a W put a freaking circle around it
and call it lunch! Let's go grab a beer! I make a
motion to adjorn!!! All in favor gets the first round
on me. Do I have a second?"
Next thing we know, we had our beloved logo, a
decision had been made and all had beir for lunch!
