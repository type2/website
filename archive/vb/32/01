Hi Ric,
If you like you engine to rock like a demented cemet mixer when just idling 
then do not balance the rods, pistons to within a gnats arse.  Plus do not 
make sure the CR is low enough (7.1:1 or lower seems to work for us.) to 
prevent detonation and is equal volume as possible.  We once had an engine 
that we had to retorque all the engine tin screws every 500 miles or loose 
them due to these very reasons!  Eric&Barb
