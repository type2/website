Subject: Any interest in Peka or Westy Tow hitch??

I have an oppertunity to aquire a westfalia and Peka
tow hitch.  Both are for pre 67 bus's.  Anyone have an
idea of the fair market price for these right now? 
What are people asking for them and what are they
actually selling for?

I am thinking of getting both of them and selling one
off.  Anyone have any input on price or interest in
either.

Thanks
Matthew
