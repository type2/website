Just a few words about seat belts and safety...

We have three vehicles:
1. Ford F150- 3 point harness + airbag (in the wheel)
2. Toyota Landcruiser- 3 point harness + airbag
(behind the whl)
3. '67 Westy- whimpy prehistoric singular lapbelt with
no sign of crush zone in front of the airbag (behind
the whl) Stock steel dash to bounce head off of.
Probably communicating like Stephen William Hawking
without a brain following a minor head-on.

Daughter was born and I immediately flipped into a
protective Dad mode wishing for a full frame, real
seat belts and more comfort. Did not want my baby or
her mother rolling around the arse end of the bus like
Lady Diana Spencer of Wales, Dodi Al-Fayed or
separately like Madonna in a whacky BMW commercial.
Buses? Yeah, I love em. Do I trust them with my safety
or that of my family? Hell no. I just risk it on a
regular basis. Less so now that I'm responsible for
more than myself. It finally dawned on me that life is
not about me. I'll reevaluate in about 25 years.
Seat belts? Please wear 'em and live another day to
disagree with my emails! I prefer a live debate to a
dead issue...
