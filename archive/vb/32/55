It is in fact Reimspeiss, and he did get a 100 mark
bonus for it.  Hope you had fun.:)

Regarding who designed the VW emblem:
I still think that it was a committee thing and stand
by my story. History will never know if Reimspeiss had
a wife who had a three-legged dog. Perhaps he had a
caucasian teenaged son with attempted dread locked
hair and unlaundered Tshirts. The sons' dog was
probably named something nonclever like dee-oh-gee.
The kid probably traveled around Europe dodging Nazis
and following a "polka band with a new edge"* in a
gypsywagon. History is funny that way. It tends to
leave out the details of the REAL story. ;-)
