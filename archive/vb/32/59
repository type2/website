Subject: 8mm head studs and woodruff key questions

In the continuing saga of my attempt at the worlds longest most
protracted stock 1600 rebuild, I have a few questions and a request.

I'm using OG 8 mm head studs for this motor as I was informed that the
new 8 mm ones have a tendency to stretch.  I traded my local shop my old
10 mm ones (that they wanted for their HP motors) for the good 8 mm
studs. I'm using a new case, and I'd of had to have gone to the expense
of having the machine shop drill and tap and insert for 10 mm to have
used them so I opted not to.

In checking them out, one is slightly tweaked and the shop has no more
(nor anyone else).  Does anyone have a good 8 mm (long one) stud I could
buy?  I also wondered if anyone has the correct length of the short
studs (8 mm)?  All the longs ones I got were the same.  The short ones
were varied slightly (by 4-6mm).  Not much difference, but should they
all be the same length?  I'm guessing as long as you can get full thread
on the nut, they will be fine.

The other question is about the woodruff keys on the crank.  One large
and one small.  Can these be re-used?

Again, anyone have a good straight long 8 mm stud laying around I can
have(buy)??

Thanks.

Steve
