Someone probably put the gear on backwards?  I don't know if that is even
possible.  The gear on the crank has a bevel to fit against the crank.  I
had one that the guy ground down the end of the gear to fit.
Seat belts.  Why does it always seem like the fella driving while
intoxicated whether wearing seat belts or not is never injured in an
accident?  When my dad was racing sportscars in the 50's the cars did not
have roll bars or seat belts.  I was a European thing.  Race drivers in
Europe believed that it was safer to get clear of the car than to be in it
during the accident.  Of course they wore metal helmets covered with
leather and T-shirts too.
