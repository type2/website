Use your vintage VW bus as a daily driver in places where road salt
is used and in five to seven years you'll have a nice parts bus with
enough rot on it that many states won't allow you to register it.
And I speak from experience.  The 71 bus I have now spent most of its
life in New Mexico.  Once they start spreading the salt, it goes into
the garage and doesn't come out until they sweep the stuff up.  It's
sad but I want to keep this bus alive for another five years.
