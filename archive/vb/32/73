Thanks Scott,
I couldn't agree more and I hope I didn't seem to flippant with my "illusion"
remark. In 1970 I pulled my '68 bug out in front of a truck that was doing
40MPH. It tore the entire front end (including axle) off and I did about 6
donuts. When I came to a stop my feet were sticking out into nothing but air
and both shoes were gone. Way back then I had a seatbelt on - it saved my life.
Regarding my bus I can bolt the rear seat ones behind but I was referring to
the middle seat where the seat itself is non stable (removeable). That's the
one where I'll probably use the u-bolt idea.

Thanks,

60's Guy
