 of control on a windy road. His buddy walked away...he had his seatbelt on.
 My friend was a great guy, but he always gave me excuses. I'll miss him on
 his birthday this month, he would have been 38. He was a stubborn guy and
 it cost him his life. >>


A second thought, one of our friends is in a wheelchair , WHY well the 
shoulder belt part was not comfortable, so he had it under his armpit , well 
some idiot tryed to pass 10 cars on a curve , all they saw was a headon or  
the dirt, they hit the dirt , rolled 8-10 times......
driver walked away , Rob is in the wheelchair forever
this was in a modern rent-a-car on the way to Bonneville, 
I drive slower now and always have the 3 point belt on properly
