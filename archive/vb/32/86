heya eveyone...

I have been getting lonely here in chico for some VW people to keep me 
company...the nearest monthly meeting club is in redding or sacremento, about 
an hour and a half away (in my bus, haha). SO..i have taken it upon myself to 
get some people together to form a monthly meeting club. i know there are VW 
people in the area who would like to form a group...nothing special (yet) but 
i thought this would be a good place to start the word of a monthly meeting 
vw meet/cruise. i dont know yet what time of the month each meeting will be, 
but probobly alwayls on the same weekend, to keep it regular ( ie every first 
saturday, every secont tuesday, etc)
if people in the sacremento valley, chico, redbluff, oroville, paradise area 
(or wherever) would be interested, please give me a holler! you can email me 
through the mailing list, or email me directly.
