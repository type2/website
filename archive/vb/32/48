Hello Everyone,

I'm new to the list and have been reading only for the first week. I've
gotten some great info but also a little too much non bus stuff. Now I
have a few questions. I have a '66 21 W Deluxe that needs middle and
rear  seat seatbelts. How can I attach them to the seats without
drilling through the floor? I only want the illusion of safety. Also, I
have no outside mirrors. What is a good way to get the hinge pin out of
the door hinges and put the window post in without to  much damage to a
nice paint job. Thanks in advance.
