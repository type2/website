I am not saying this is a good or bad product...  But "made in China" does
not get my $ vote.  Remember they are still a communist country.  Or have we
all forgotten about Tienamin Square and the recent plane events.  Also I
have not seen China helping NATO in this time of need, maybe they are on the
other side?

I think it is worth a few more bucks to get a "made in the USA" label on my
products...  Or at least not in China!  And sometimes you, as a buyer, have
no option but to get "made in China" which is sad.
