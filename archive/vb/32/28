Thanks for all the replies once again.

I had the flywheel resurfaced today and sent it, the pressure plate, the
pistons and the pulley to visit the crankshaft and rods at the machine shop.
They will balance the whole assembly for 75 smackers, and from the replies I
received, that sounds like money well spent.

Mad Uncle Dave is bringing up a Plexiglas piece in the morning to cc the
thing when I get that far. Since I work all the time, this will push back my
finish dates a couple of weeks, but better to it right the first time!

Thanks guys, I am learning a lot.

BTW, our bus is in VW trends this month (Nov 2001). Page 39 the white one
with our dog in the background!
