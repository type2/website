Hey you two - break it up...

Anyway, I'm pretty sure your headlight adjustment is
slightly off.  I've been running H-4s on both my 73
Beetle and 66 Crewcab for years.  Neither blind people
nor do I have problems with the law.  If the brows are
serving a purpose, your headlights are shining too far
upwards.  BTW, in addition to the H-4s being brighter
anyway, I run 80/110 bulbs in mine.  They are actually
VERY effective at letting other people know they have
their highbeams on when approaching me.  Normally, I
don't need my highbeams on at all, basically because I
have more powerful lights on normally, and they are
adjusted perfectly.  Even got the signoff from the
local DMV, and they didn't even mention that I was
running higher wattage bulbs.
