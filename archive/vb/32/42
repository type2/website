I do not have the name in front of me for the correct spelling But the VW
Emblem was designed by a member of Porsche staff in the late 30's
"Reimprese"? I know the spelling is wrong--But I DO know he is the designer
for the VW Logo-- Also early on Porsche set a world record for altitude in a
hot air balloon--also land & speed and distance records in Electric
cars--with an electric motor in each wheel--And he was voted the Best
Automotive Engineer of this past century--Right her in America - Las Vegas!!
