Hi Steve,
Then if the dimples are not very deep you should be able to knock them back 
out.  If they do not pound out then cut and weld in replacement pieces in 
just those areas.  We pounded out about a dozen small dents in our 63 SC with 
great success.  We still need to learn how to shrink metal sometime to do 
deeper more stretched areas.
