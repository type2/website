The question regarding the "need" for seatbelts is a good one. The reason is
psychological. My wife and kid are so used to buckling up (a good thing) that
they won't even ride in the bus without belts (which has its advantages).
Before I put the belts in the front I felt strangely vulnerable and ill at
ease also even though in a front end collision with no airbags I realize the
belts will just make it a bit easier to locate my corpse. I just want to
extend the same courtesy to my passengers.
