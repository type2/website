Hey kosmic karma guy,
 I do have them, go park your bus in front of a wall
and fix them lights. Don't make excuses. Eyebrows are
not for H-4's, VW's didnt come with H-4's. And dont
tell me they are to keep the rain off the headlights
either. If you run them, I have no problem with that,
just dont make stuff up.
 Mike
