Subject: Body work

Decided to do what little body work needs to be done on my '67 Camper
myself.  Being an original California car, there is no rustwork/welding
that needs to be done.

My concerns are mainly in both rear corners, which already had body
filler applied from the previous owner, (I'm the second owner of this
camper).  I've sanded and re-filled both corners about 360 times each.
With the curves in the metal, I seem to just keep sanding off all of the
filler that I apply.  The other area I'm having problems with is above
the rear wheel well lip, just below the air vents.  I fill and then sand
this area until it is smooth, but when I run a straight-edge over this
area, it is constantly bowed in, indicating again, that I am sanding off
too much filler.  I expect a certain amount of re-doing what I've done,
and I don't expect to become an expert body repair person in just a few
weekends, but does anyone have any tips for doing this work?  I've
decided not to fill in the sides of my bus and block sand them with the
14 inch sanding blocks to get that super-smooth, mirror like flatness to
the sides.  This bus will be my daily driver, and my sides are already
pretty straight.  I want to be able to park it without worrying about
it.  Any help or tips would be appreciated.

Thank you,
