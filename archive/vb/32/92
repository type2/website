Subject: Re: [VB] Questions from a Groovy Dude-belts


In front I use a 4 point harness made by Tiger which I bought at Latest
Rage.  It is excellent and I strongly encourage this style of belts use over
a hacked in 3 point.  My concern is that the 3 point top hold will just be
drilled in and not reinforced like it should be.  With the 4 point I am
almost guaranteed not to eat windshield.  

The passenger side is a lapbelt, which I am not overjoyed about.  I would
like to put a 4 point in but will not work well with the 1/3 2/3 seats.
Usually no one rides up front anyway, so not a big deal.  

We use lapbelts in the rear.  Holds the baby seat and mom just fine when we
a cruising to campouts.

I like the feeling of safety with the belts.... But almost think I am a dead
duck anyway I cut it in a bus during a head on collision...  Comes as part
of the entry fee.
