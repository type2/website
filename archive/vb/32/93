Hi John,
If you're going to spend the money, get your frames from Oldvolks.com.
These frames are made by Creative Engineering in England, and are
absolutely the best available.  I heard that you can take half of an
original Pop-Out frame and it will fit right together with another half
from Oldvolks.  They may cost a little more, but they are worth it.
