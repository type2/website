Subject: heater boxes

Ok the franken motor is just about done and of course I dont have the right
heater boxes for a 68-71 bay, just bug ones.  The control lever on the type
3 ones look the same, has anyone ever used one on a bay or failing that,
converted bug heater boxes to early bay ones? Anybody in BC got a pair they
need to get rid of?
thanks all
