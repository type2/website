hey all. i have a very nice pair of fresh air heater boxes to get rid of. 
they would fit busses with the small diameter heater inlet into the body, like 
62 up to 64? of course you'd have to have a 40 hp with fresh air heating.

i can deliver to albuquerque, maple grove show in PA june 9, or to 
litchfield. 

p-mail me before tomorrow night if interested (may 31), because i leave 
saturday morning.
