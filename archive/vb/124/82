Subject: RE VW tons

I don't know how much truth there is in it, but my 63 double cab is rated as
a 1 ton. The reason being there was a tariff on 1/2 ton pickups being
imported from Germany, supposedly because there was a German tariff on
chickens being exported to Germany.
The fellow I bought the 'cab from ( a German guy ) said it was called the
'chicken war'
Any body know if this is fact or fiction?
