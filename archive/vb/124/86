Hi Kevin,
Either you need to adjust your clutch cable and/or refill your tranny and/or 
your syncros in the tranny are damaged or getting damaged or are worn out 
already.  If refilling, adjusting or driving more carefully to make sure the 
RPMs of the engine and tranny are closer together and/or double clutching to 
make it so.  You might just need to begin to save up $$$$ for a tranny 
rebuild soon.....
