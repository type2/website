Yes, RMMW has filed for chap 11 reorganization.  As far as VWofA, all I can say for sure is...my stepson worked there for a while.  He received a letter from the Colorado Attny General (as did many/all of the employees) requesting if he had any information involving copyright infringement. I believe another contributing factor is the Teller County/Woodland Park business and property tax setup.


>>I heard last week that RMMW has filed for bankruptcy.  Source cited was an article in one of the USA VW magazines.<<
