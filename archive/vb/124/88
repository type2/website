Hi Raymond,
We find it best to install everything and then use a screwdriver to twist/pry 
the spring over the clutch cable arm.

 Is there a best way? 2. What are the little rubber pieces in the crossover 
shaft

They in our opion are garbage, but in the kit you have they go around the 
clutch TO arm and inside the thin potmetal tube into the TO arm bore of the 
tranny.  Best ot use a solid bronze bushing kit instead!

3. What size dowel do I need to buy to make a pressure platealignment tool?

We just align the splined hole of the clutch disc by eye with the holes in 
the pressure plater and the FW gland bolt.  Then tighten the pressure plate 
bolts enough to hold the disc in place.
Make sure to use a TO arm that has a welded bead at the rear base of the 
arms.  Make sure to have the TO arms equal spacing to the tranny input shaft 
or shim it centered!  Make sure the eye of the clutch cable arm that the rear 
of this cable goes through had the rear end of the boden tube aim directly 
through it or you need to install a differant clutch cable arm!  Failure to 
follow this last paragraph can easily result in constant repairs/replacements 
of these components!
