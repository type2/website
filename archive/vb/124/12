Subject: front seal


Well after a year of body work on my bus I decided to bolt the motor back in 
and get it running to prevent getting a ton of grease or anything on it 
after paint.The motor went right in and had it all hooked up and started 
within an hour,after about two minutes it stated puking oil from between the 
engine and tranny.I would like to think it is just the front seal but it was 
just replaced when I took the motor apart and put new gaskets on it last 
fall.Are they known to dry out ,or shrink?
Frustrated in Alaska....
Carl
