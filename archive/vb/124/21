Yes.

The rumor is that they are going to focus either on Internet Sales, or
Mail Order Catalogs, but not both.  The expanded too fast and got
caught when the resesion hit.  I've heard that they were going to try
to stay in business but I suspect that they may have folded their tent.

>B.   If so, does anyone know if VWoA had a hand in this development?

Yes. No. Maybe. Kinda Sorta. Not really. Could be. Who knows.

I don't think that VWOA had a direct hand in what happened to RMMW, but
they did kick'em when they were down.  Along with the down turn in the
economy came VWOA's Leagle Beagles nailing folks for copyright and
trademark infringment.  RMMW was left, I'm sure, with a large inventory
of unsalable products that they couldn't get their money back on.
Anyone who has ever run a small business can tell you, loose enough
inventory and no insurance to cover the loss, you go down for the count
real quick.  Did VWOA cause the downfall of RMMW?  Probably not.  But
they didn't help either.

Please check the facts yourself as best you can.  Most of what I know is
conjecture and is not to be trusted as gospel.  Just the way I see it.

All I ask is that you clue me in on the truth before you shoot me for
what I said.
