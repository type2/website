Subject: My nuts are too big...

Contrary to your initial thoughts, this is 100% bus content.
 
I lowered the front of my bus a while ago and finally bought a set of
Bus Boys "boomerangs" for the rear this month. The PO installed an IRS
suspension in the back with the wide five bolt pattern on it. I _think_
the drums are from a Type 3, but can't be certain. Anybody?
 
My main question: The axle nuts are significantly larger than my 36mm
socket and I wondered if anyone knew what size they might be? According
to Muir, there are 3 sizes available, but I don't know which this is. My
micrometer doesn't get that big. :-(
 
Any help is appreciated. As are sarcastic comebacks...
 
Thanks,
