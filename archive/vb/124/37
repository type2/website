oil from between the engine and tranny.I would like to think it is just
the front seal but it was just replaced when I took the motor apart and
put new gaskets on it last  fall.Are they known to dry out ,or shrink?

I suppose they could "dry out."  I take it you didn't remove the
clutch/flywheel, just bolted the whole engine back to the transmission. 
If the engine sat since last fall, there could have been rust developing
on the flywheel at the point it hits the seal.  Perhaps the rust wearing
off screwed the seal.

I had a similar problem when I put in a new Brazilian case with a rubber
cam plug instead of the old metal "bottle top" cam plug.  All the
symptoms were like a bad seal.  I pulled the clutch and flywheel only to
have the rubber plug fall on the ground.  Cleaned everything and tapped
the plug back in with some (horrors!) RTV silicone on it, then let it
cure before trying the engine.  So far, so good.

Sure it's oil?  Pushing the engine back in crooked can screw the
transmission seal.  BTDT.
