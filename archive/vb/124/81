Hi Bill,
First the position of the distributor drive is not a problem as long as it=20
allows the distributor to align up as to allow proper timing!  Next remove=20
and clean your tranny grounding strap.  Followed by buying a voltage/ohm=20
meter from your local hardware store for about $15-20.00.  Make sure to buy=20
one that shows well the 0-15 range and we prefer the non-digital LCD type, i=
n=20
other words the ones with the old fashion needle to watch swing back a forth=
.=20
 Then check your voltage at the battery directly and check for voltage drop=20
at each and every connection going from the battery to the starter to the=20
fuse box to the headlight switch to the ignition switch and back the the=20
starter solinoid.  Clean all connections and add a dab of vasalene, or=20
dielectric grease to help prevent future corrosion.  Any componants that do=20
not clean up either need to be replaced or repaired by soldering internal=20
compontents together!
