those of you who have traveled with a tilt before.  Does it make a lot =
of difference in power and/or mileage with the tilt on?  Seems like the =
12" or so it stands above the cab would catch a lot of wind.  Trying to =
decide if I'm going to drive with the canvas on or not on my trip to =
OCTO/Classic from FL.  Any other considerations?

-Dan
