Subject: Thumper for sale (sniff)

All,
I begged and pleaded to get another truck as soon as one came available.
Well I got my wish. Unfortunately, my lifestyle cannot afford this luxury
right now with so many family situations
going on around me. I even had to turn down a rebuild job on an engine for a
friend because I
simply do not have the time to put another engine together.

This truck, like so many others, still needs work to be done. I wish MetWiz
was my best friend!
I have many new parts and a long list of work that has already been
completed on this daily
driver. PICs are available for the asking and I can take more of any part of
the truck in question.

I'll be honest with you, I paid good money for this truck and I put a lot of
work and a new engine
in it to satisfy my needs as a dependable daily driver. I'm asking $4000 for
it and everything that
goes with it, and not a dime less. If that seems like too much, I'll keep it
and work things out
another way. Thanks
