Subject: re:insulating the DC

I looked at the heater jacket photo of inside your door-is is waterproof?
water teavels through your door every time it rains....

I put some of the high density viscoelastic sound dampener from mcmaster
carr on the inside of my front doors-did not seem to make the bus any
quieter inside, but the doors sound nice and solid when i shut them now.

Mcmaster carr has a pretty nice description on their webiste of the
different wasy of controlling sound. unfortunately I am experiencing
problems with their site right now so i cant point you too the exact
page-but try mcmaster.com, and search for sound proofing or somethign like
that.
