I have a few of the above mentioned ones at a special listmember price of
$69, but they only cover '69-79, so of course they're of no use to splitty
owners.   According to the sales manager at Bentley, there are no plans to
put out an earlier one at this time.  FWIW, the CD is actually scans of old
microfiches (scratches and all), not data from the Ekta discs. They are
essentially modified .pdf files and are searchable but slow.
