Subject: Re: [VB] Engine install question...

Another trick that I do is chew some gum when I start the install. By 
the time I get to the starter bolt, I stick the gum on the head and 
it keeps it from moving while I get the nut on from in the engine 
compartment. One time the only gum I had was some kind of kids 
apsiren gum. Yuck!!!! The things we do for our VW's.
