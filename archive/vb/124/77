A little (very little) more info on the Mac issue, as I queried Bentley on
it but didn't get very far:
While the first Bentley CD's used plain-vanilla pdf's (and therefore were
cross-platform), the new ones use their Windows-only eBahn reader instead of
Acrobat.  While I have been told by the sales manager at Bentley that the
files are still pdf files, none of the files on the new CD's actually have
.pdf extensions anymore.  So the question is, are the files merely pdf files
with renamed extensions?  If so, then they may work on Mac via Acrobat, even
if Bentley doesn't support it, since Mac's don't care about Windows
extensions anyway.  Or, are the files themselves modified in some way other
than just an extension change (to prevent their use on anything but theBahn
reader)?  I don't know the answer to this, and Bentley won't tell me.  All
they'll say is "sorry, we don't support Mac anymore."
