Subject: shifting clunk

I noticed(and I am not sure when this began) when driving for a while, on
the highway mostly, if I  slow down to a stop or basically a stop-when I go
to get back in gear there is a kind of clunk of the engine engaging-no
grinding noises or anything. I cant figure out what it is. I believe I am
shifting in the exact same way as when the engine is cooler.

Any ideas?
