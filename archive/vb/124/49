Just finished making travel arrangements for my son to join me after the =
Classic.  He will be flying in Sunday evening after the Classic.  We are =
headed toward the Redwood forest then on to Seattle from there.  I'm not =
much of a late night driver and was hoping to find someone who could =
provide a camping spot or knew of a good one an hour or two north of LA. =
 Just me and my son, no pets.  Please relay the message to Ronnie at Old =
Volks Home or see me at OCTO.  Leaving from FL within the hour.

Thanks,
Dan
