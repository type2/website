Subject: wanted: 21-window walk-thru

Hi,

I've been trolling the usual spots for a 21 window walk-thru off & on for a
while now, trying to educate myself - very slowly - and to figure out what
I'm looking for, etc.... I'm finally getting close to being ready to pull
the trigger, but I still haven't found a bus that really fits the bill.
"What's the bill?..." Per the subject line, a 21-window walk-thru. I have
all the usual (utopian) preferences, of course - "no rust," "all original,"
etc., etc.... - but to be more specific:

1. I can't take on any kind of a project; and
2. The bus has to work as a daily driver (no trailer queens, thank you).

As for my budget ... I'm more than willing to pay a fair price for the right
bus. I could spend a little more, or a little less, depending on what the
bus has to offer....

If you have, or know of a bus that's available, and may fit this bill,
please p-mail me.

Thanks a lot,
Matthew
