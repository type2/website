I've always wondered: the people who take these epic road trips -
how do they support themselves while on the road for weeks at a 
time?  I have a decent job (for now!) myself, but I can't imagine
taking 6 weeks off to go fart around the country in a bus without
pay.  

The money for all that gas and oil and food and parts, etc has to 
come from *somewhere*.  Do they just hit a liquor store in each
town they pass thru?  Rich uncle?  Sugar momma?  Parts whoring?
