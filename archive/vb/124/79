Hi Blake,
Where to set your timing depends on the distributor used and size type of 
engine it is used on!  As for your timing marks you need to blueprint them to 
really know what they indicate.  They could be DPO file marks!  At the very 
least use the screwdriver through #1 sparkplug hole to find TDC of that 
piston.  Or do as we do and use an aftermarket degree pulley that has already 
been blueprinted as a measuring tool.

Check your jetting of the carb to what size and type of engine you are using, 
clean your carb and even perhaps it needs to be boiled in water for a few 
hours to remove gasolene varnish clogging the passages inside it.   Also go 
through a tune up again and see if that helps the idle.
