Until small businesses and other individuals can find a way to 
organize and create a "united front" to be pro-active in attacking 
VWoA rather than being small individuals trying to survive maybe 
defending themselves...yes...this is it. VWoA holds the ball and they 
know it. So they really don't care.

For the game to change it'll take a "pool" of businesses to go up 
against them. Unfortunatly most businesses are just trying to survive 
and VWoA knows this. So they sue them over stuff that just might be 
silly sometimes. Then the small business has to make the choice to 
"settle" because it's more cost effective. Even if VWoA doesn't have 
a case, they will be able to tie things up in the legal system 
forever and cause small business to spend tons of money they don't 
have. In the eventual end the small business MIGHT win, but at the 
cost of their business, family, and life. Very unfortunate situation.

This is our antiquated legal system and government at work folks. The 
only chance is to create an organization big and rich enough to at 
least attack (not just defend against) VWoA. And throw lots of bad 
publicity for them as well. Lots of time and money still and I just 
don't see how the good folks selling parts and fixing VW's for us 
would even be interested. Very unfortunate for the hobbiest community 
and the retailers that support it.

of course all my opinion.
