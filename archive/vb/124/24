just stumbling around the internet and came acros this site:

 

http://www.oldiecaravan.de/index.html 

 

there are some pages about Eriba trailers and even some pages with 
directions on how to set up the tent. there are also some pages with some really 
nifty Westfalia trailers. just go to the alphabetical section where the name of 
your trailer is (e for eriba, NOT p for puck) and follow the links. it's pretty 
neat. there are also other european trailers as well.

bus content: just got a 58 Westy from idaho (thanks Lind). anyone have 
any info, literature (scans, xerox ok), extra parts?
