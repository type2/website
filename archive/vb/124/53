Dan,

I've traveled thousands of highway miles w/ a tilt on my DC and haven't
noticed much difference w/ top speed, but definitely a difference w/ cross
winds and big headwinds.  Supposedly top speed is about 5 mph less, but I
haven't noticed a major drop in gas mileage although I'm not to AR about
keeping track of mileage either.

There's nothing funner(well almost nutin) than cruising down the highway w/
your "covered wagon thing" on the back and having people point at
you/wave/high five/ etc. as you go by!!  In any event, those tilts are
made/priced to be used! Use It!!
