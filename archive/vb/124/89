Subject: re:insulating the DC

Good point. Don't use the sound barrier here but "mass load" with
dynamat.

IMHO, McMaster is too high end industrial. Very expensive too. The cheap
roofing KOOLPATCH and ICEGUARD are cheap and work very well. Read the
http://www.bulley-hewlett.com/VWindex/ page to understand Mass loading
and the difference between sound dampening and Sound absorption. 

Anyone want to help me do this peel and stick task?
