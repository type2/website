The 195 tire is not actually taller. It has a /75 in it. So it would be
195/75R14.

 There is a 195R14 made.  I almost bought a pair but decided on the
 185R14 instead.  Apparently there is also a 205R14.

 Crazy metric system.

I believe Steve left out the /75 for brevity. If you go to the Kumho website:
http://www.kumhousa.com/TireSelect/
and put in 195, empty box at bottom, and then 14.    You get NO no-aspect ratio
tires available in either 195 or 205 variety. They do not show a 185R14 either...... 

If you could put in 82 instead of 80 at http://www.miata.net/garage/tirecalc.html
you would get the correct Bentley diameter of 25.8". But because you can only enter 80,
you get 25.7".
