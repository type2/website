Curt,

I just installed a 1776 in my bus with a weber DFAV progressive carb. I
assume that you have about the same. Do you know the jetting you have
installed? Mains and air correction? I was running the carb on a 1600 and it
was always rich. I don't know what the jetting was. My mileage was around 18
in town and about 20 on the highway.

Thanks,
Chris
