Take a look at:
http://www.bridgestonetire.com/tireselector/index_bs.asp?pagesource=searchbyproduct

Seems that the smallest tire is a P205-75R15, Sorry about that if you have
14" rims. Looks like I will need to find something else to use for a spare
as these are too wide for the spare tire well behind my 2/3 front seat.
Anyone want to purchase an unused previously owned tire?
