Subject: rims

Well, I must have really stepped in it by asking whether 15" tires can
fit on 14" rims. Nobody answered and gently showed me the error of my
ways. The answer seems kind of obvious now. So, another question; how
common are 15" rims to buy for a bus? Can they be bought new? Are there
used ones out there? I read where somebody had rims from different years
and that was the best he could do, so maybe not. Additionally, is there
any advantage to one size over the other? I am running 14" tires but
would upgrade to 15's if it seemed appropriate and affordable.

Thanks, Jason
