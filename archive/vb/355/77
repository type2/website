Arnaud,

Dump the 009 first.  *Always* fix all the electrical system up to be top 
notch and exactly to spec before touching carbs.

That includes the correct non-platinum spark plugs as well as
new wires, boots, etc.

You have been warned<grin>.

Trust me on this...don't ask me how I know!

Cheers, dave
