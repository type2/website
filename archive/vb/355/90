I won't repeat what has already been discussed, but will add 1 variable to
discuss my gas mileage in the 63 DC. I have run this w/ both a 1600 DP w/
the dreaded 009, header exhaust, & w/ my present engine: 1776, dual kadrons,
electronic ignition in 009 dizzy, magnaflow exhaust, stock cam, heavier
valve springs.

The variable in both these engines is a stock height tilt & roof rack over
the cab. Get about 16-18 mpg at 60+- mph.  If I drive 45-55 can get as much
as 26 mpg. VW specs say top speed for truck w/ tilt is 5 mph less, which I
haven't really noticed, but wonder how much it affects my gas mileage? I get
about the same mpg w/ both engines.  It appears to me that the biggest mpg
consideration for moi is the drag created by the tilt & roof rack & speed
rather than the engine size, etc.

Tom Buese-it is now cheaper for moi to fly to CA. Shows than drive 1 of my
buses
