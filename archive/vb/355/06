Here's what i'm running, and love them in a 195/75R14 size:

The speedo and odometer stay correct and the spare tire still fits in my
Westy cabinetry like stock. I was still able to get my bus stuck in a sandy
riverbed last summer, so they aren't unstoppable, but very much improved
over the tires that were on it when I bought it. I do a lot of camping in
the summer, so they are an added bonus for when we go off the beaten trail
to find our own secluded camping spot.
