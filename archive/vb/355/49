Subject: I'm back!

Well, it's not like anybody missed me anyways...hehe.

I'm now settled in Colorado-the wife and kids still in CA though, probabaly
til this summer.  It's been a few months and I need my list-fix.

Currently busless-well technically I have DC in TX that I need to pick up, but
it's been several years since I havent had a bus as my daily driver.  So if
anyone knows of a cheap project in western CO, let me know.

Glad to be back and interested in what I missed the past few months.

Later,
Beto
Montrose, CO
/needin' a bus sum kinda bad/
