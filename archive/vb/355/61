Does anyone have a copy of this book they would like to part with?  Perhaps
you have an extra, or are simply looking to recycle the one you already
have????  If so, I'd love to buy it!  (or trade for it)  Seems like these were
all over the place in '02, before I shipped out to Iraq, but I'm unable to
find one in any bookstore since returning.  Please email me off list if you
can help me out.  Thanks!  ~john  ps.  Here's what the book looks like:
