I thought 15" bus rims were wider to, but according to Thom's site, 15" bus
rims were 4.5" w. & 14" rims went to 5" w.????

I have bought decent 15" bus rims for as low as $5-10 each at junk yards,
swaps, but they usually need more hubcap clips.

Clara, what size  rims came on 63 1 tons?

I agree that the 15's look cooler- I know volks that run them on their
64-67's just because they like the way they look.  I hadn't thought about
the gearing difference-how does that work?

I had a good set of 15's w/ decent tires/all the clips on them for sale at
several swaps, & couldn't get $30/each for them-still got them-you can never
have to many wheels-wheels are good!

Tom Buese-the tire/wheel thread is being beat to death on both type 2 sites
& yet I still have questions, learn sumtin new each time.
