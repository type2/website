Subject: Will a z-bed from a '70 camper fit a split?

I have a '65 that I'm restoring, and recently picked up a z-bed for
CHEAP...Anyways, it came out of a '70 Westphalia camper. I'm assuming
I'll have to make slight modifications to get this installed, but does
anyone have details on how to do this, or is there a writeup online
somewhere that I can refer to?

Thanks,Michael (vwdrum)
