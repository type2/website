Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] the hubcap?

i can't remember - was it an april-fool's-type joke that someone 
wiped off all the signatures from the hubcap, or did that really 
happen?

sure would like to see it someday ... if it is still in CO, maybe it 
could go to the 4 corners campout or jerome this year???
