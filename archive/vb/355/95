It is a step in the right direction  Mileage will depend on your Collector
car insurance company. some are much better then others  you will have to
shop around

Exemption for Collectible Vehicles Signed Into Law by Governor


In Arizona, you don't register as a collector vehicle.  With this new law,
you need to have collector car insurance, and whatever the mileage
limitations are with the insurance, are the limitations.  The state is
letting the insurance companies provide the guidelines as to what is a
collector car. The collector insurances we've had (there have been several
over the years) usually allow 1500-2500 miles a year.
The new law isn't perfect, but it's better than what we've had.

So is this one of those very limited use claused laws? You can do this but
the vehicle has to be registered and insured as a collector vehicle limited
to shows and parades and not more than 300 miles a year?

Just curious...
