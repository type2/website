15" wheels came on buses through 63, except 63 1 tons, and in early 64,  
about till the end of the pull handle, but didn't change at quite the same time  
as the door handle.   Sometimes you see 15" bus rims at swaps, they  have the 
larger 'rectangular' slots in them.   bus 15"s are wider than  bug 15"s.   If 
you look carefully at he face, you'll see a VW  stamp somewhere, and a date 
stamp within a circle with I think the month over  the year.  
 When your bus was new all the wheels were taken from the same pile,  so all 
would match down to the date code, and be made not long before the bus...  It 
is unusual to find the original rims on a bus still.   I'd like to  find a set 
of 3/61 dated rims for my 61 (whose birthday was yesterday... Happy  Birthday 
Red Bus!!!!), maybe one day....
 
oh, larger wheels effectively increase the gearing.  And the 15"s look  
cooler.  As the 14"s were used 64-70, there are tons more around, and  15"s end up 
being harder to find, thus cost more.

Well, I  must have really stepped in it by asking whether 15" tires can
fit on 14"  rims. Nobody answered and gently showed me the error of my
ways. The answer  seems kind of obvious now. So, another question; how
common are 15" rims to  buy for a bus? Can they be bought new? Are there
used ones out there? I  read where somebody had rims from different years
and that was the best he  could do, so maybe not. Additionally, is there
any advantage to one size  over the other? I am running 14" tires but
would upgrade to 15's if it  seemed appropriate and affordable.

Thanks,  Jason
