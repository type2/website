All,

A while back I wrote the customer service addresses of several major
tire companies, asking what they would recommend for "modern" replacement
tires for a Bus.  I knew what the list wisdom was and I wanted to compare
it to their responses.  I was also checking to see how well various
companies responded to inquiries.  The results are summarized here:

Let me also throw in a plug for http://www.type2.com/library/tires.htm .
