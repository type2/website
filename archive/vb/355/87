Be careful there about picking a good exhaust if you have single carb.
On my previous bus (1971 stock ) I noticed 2-3 mpg drop (from 23 to
20mpg) as I went from the stock muffler to the "high performance"
Monza exhaust with 4 tail pipes.

Might be that the heat riser tube was not getting warm due to lousy
engineering of the monza exhaust (symmetric heat riser connectors). On
the stock muffler, the right heat riser connects near the exhaust
port, while the left one dives in the muffler, creating a pressure
difference and a hot air flow in the heat riser tube.
