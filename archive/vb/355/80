In Europe we don't use kpl (lilometer per liter, but liter / 100 km).
I do not know about Canada. It feels awkward switching from one unit
to the other but one gets used to it. I know the following

10mpg (H2) : 23.6 l/100
20mpg (bus) : 11.7 l/100
30mpg (golf) : 7.8 l/100
50mpg (kawasaki ninja) : 4.7 l/100
x mpg -> 3.78/(x*1.61) l/100

In the list, there is one vehicle that I do not own, guess which one
it is... I find that people are more concerned about fuel economy in
Europe than in the US, likely because fuel is more expensive there,
maybe it's also a cultural thing.
