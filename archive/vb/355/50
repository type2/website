Subject: Any Louisville listees?

All,

Starting later today (Tuesday, 12 April), I'm traveling
from Tulsa to Louisville, KY (via St. Louis, MO) for work.
for at least a day or two.  (Driving the company F(-at-)rd,
unfortunately.)  I will be busy during the day, but if any
area listees would like to meet up for a beverage or maybe
an engine pull one evening, let me know via email to this
address.  I can check my email on the road.  Thanks!

Matt Roberds
