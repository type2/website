Hey matt & list here is some more info to add to your list of manufacturers
responses...

My email:

"I am looking for a tire for my 1965 VW bus, I have certain specifications
that I would like the tire to meet. It would be nice to be able to search
through your tire selection by specification, ie a load rating between
1500-1700 pounds, 4-ply sidewall, all season, sizes for a 14 inch rim, 185
or 195.

Please let me know if you add this functionality in the future.
