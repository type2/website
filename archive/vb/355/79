Subject: RE: [VB] Most important of all, . . . these days

Howdy Volks,

I'm mostly a lurker and have a 3 ring binder stuffed full of all the great
info I have gotten off of the list.
Here's my MPG story:
'66 Deluxe
1600DP
009 Dist
single 34 pict
Bug pack exhaust
Quiet pack muffler
Stock tranny and RGB's.

19-20MPG all around town...since fixing my odometer, have yet to take the
Bus out on an extended road trip on the open road.
Thanks for this list,
Gary
Round Rock, TX

Okay, let the knu thread begin.  Mileage, in town, on highway, engine
size, stock/mod, setup, whatever you think is pertinent.  Then maybe we
can begin to see a pattern that can potentially be beneficial to the
group as a whole and to the individual pocketbook.
