Hello bussers,

If you like camping in your VW and cruising the open roads through the 
American Southwest, this event will hand you your fix on a silver platter. 

The location is the Monument Valley Utah. Date is the Memorial Day weekend. 
Camping starts as early as Thursday.

Everyone and anyone is invited as long as you show up in some sort of a VW. 

On location there is a scenic route that can take at least half a day to 
cruise through. It'd take a thesaurus to still inadequately describe it. Better to 
just see it in person, through the split screens. For shutterbugs, i'd rate 
it at 3 plus rolls or higher on the location alone. Get your films and camera 
ready.

We already have people committed to go from NV, AZ, UT, CO and NM. Caravaning 
plans will be more solid as it comes near.

It's a non-sponsored event, no prizes to raffle off, just friends driving 
around with big grins. 

If you don't have those dates planned and would like to join us, please feel 
free to respond offlist. Want to see what it's like? I can send you some 
pictures we took from our survey trip there, just 2 weeks ago. Forward this message 
to similar minded places would be great; thanks in advance.

Hope you can join us! 

Ricky
