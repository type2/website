Subject: Re: [VB] Most important of all, . . . these days

In my 60 with the BB 40 hp engine stock tranny and redux boxes I went from 
about 18 mpg (Imp) to 29/30 city 33/34 hwy after reading a post be Eric and 
Barb re: installing a tach.  I never did install the tach but I stopped 
driving fast (fast :) it's all relative) when leaving intersections etc.. I 
just started taking it really easy when leaving intersections mostly. 
Almost doubled by gas mileage!
