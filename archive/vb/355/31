Hi,

I have the Bridgestones on mine right now, P205 75R15. I have in the past
run goodyears and michelins. I think the michelins were better than the
goodyears. The michelins and goodyears both fit into the spare tire well on
the 1/3-2/3 front seat arangement. A problem with the bridgestones as I had
earlier mentioned.

The speedo seems to be quite accurate with the P205's. I have used the mile
markers on Interstate 5  and on 101, numerous times to check the speedo.
Always 60 seconds for 1 mile at 60mph on the dot.

Chris
