Subject: distributor

So ... my 60 std has a 40 hp engine ... 1400 the PO told me (not sure what 
the P's and C's are) any way ...

My current distributor is from a ... not sure ... maybe a 74 automatic 
beetle or something ... vacuum advance etc.. I'm considering picking up a 
spare distributor just to have on hand ... anyone got any suggestions?  Soon 
I hope to begin building a 1641 .. be kinda handy if the same dist. worked 
well on both my current motor and the 1641.

TIA
