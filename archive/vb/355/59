Hmmmmm!  I had always assumed that my  12/19/62 -63 DC was 1 ton, but it had
152 rims on it when I bought it years ago. Is there a 1 ton m-code?  I don9t
remember mine having one, but read that all USA  DC9s were 1 ton?  I also
read that 63 DC9s had a 1 year only hybrid rear small nut/large nut
transaxle-brakes, etc.  Still don9t know what I have? Help?

Tom-it takes a large nut to know one
