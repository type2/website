Subject: Re: [VB] Most important of all, . . . these days

In Canada life is really confusing.  Officially we should be using li/100 
kms.  But most people are much more familiar with gallons - but ... what's a 
gallon.  U.S. Gallons and Canadian (Imperial U.K.) Gallons are different. 
We've always used Imp Gallons traditionally - but now ... swamped with 
American TV ads giving mi/U.S. gallon - who knows - if you hear someone 
saying they are getting X mpg - you have no idea whether they are talking 
about Imp gallons or U.S. gallons.

Imp Gallon = 4.546 Litres
U.S. Gallon  = 3.785 Litres
