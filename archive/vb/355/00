The '73 Without Guesswork at http://failsure.net/oacdp/ shows that the
AE code engines were installed in Buses in 1971 models only, and in Bugs
in at least 1971-1972 models and possibly later.  The list in the Idiot
manual agrees that AE codes were in Buses in 1971 models only, and shows
them as being installed in Bugs from 1971 models through early 1973
models.  Going by the numbers there, your engine was probably originally
produced around May, 1971.  Mostly all this is of historical interest,
because it has probably been rebuilt at least once by now, and may or
may not match its original specs.

You might look at http://www.type2.com/library/reading.htm and buy at
least the '68-'79 Bentley manual.  It's good and will answer many
questions about yoru Bus.

Here's what I would try.  First, take off the fan belt, and try to push
and pull on the crank pulley.  If it clunks, the end play is too much.
Assuming that's OK, take out the spark plugs, squirt some oil into the
plug holes, and try to turn the engine 2 full revolutions by hand.  If
you feel resistance, stop!  Assuming that is OK, you might pop the valve
covers off and make sure the valves open and close at the right times -
even adjust them if you want.  Also pop the distributor cap off and make
sure the rotor turns as you turn the engine.  Make sure the spark plugs
are not too crudded up or broken, and put them back in.  Change the
oil... the old oil might be either thick or watery, but it shouldn't
smell like gas.  Spin the generator pulley a few times by hand to make
sure it doesn't have bunches of play or any odd noises.  Put the fan
belt back on.

You might (carefully) take off the top of the carb - five slotted screws -
and look down in the float bowl.  If it looks clean, good - put the top
back on, maybe using a new gasket from a carb rebuild kit if yours is beat
up.  Chances are better than even there will be a layer of varnish in there
that used to be gasoline.  If so, get a carb rebuild kit and one of those
gallon cans of carb cleaner.  Knock as much of the varnish as you can out
of the float bowl with a screwdriver, then take the carb apart and soak
it in the carb cleaner overnight.  (The side of the bucket says 2 or 3
hours.  That isn't long enough for a truly gunked-up carb.)  Put it all
back together, using the new parts from the kit, and put it back on the
engine.

Charge the battery if needed.  You might check the timing, but chances
are fair that it is close to right.

Put another squirt of oil in the spark plug holes, then put the plugs
back in.  Make sure nothing really valuable is within range of the
tailpipe, as it will probably shoot a little crud.  Disconnect the coil
wire at the center of the distributor cap and ground it to the engine -
not on the carb, fuel pump, or fuel lines, please.  Go up front and crank
the engine until the oil light goes out.  If it doesn't go out, or you
hear untoward noises while cranking, stop and check it out.  If everything
is OK, hook the coil wire up and give it a shot.  If it runs and sounds
good, you probably have an engine!

After you run the engine a little, you might do a compression test to
find out what kind of shape the engine is in.  If it seems reasonably
OK, you can proceed with a full regular tune-up: plugs, points, cap and
rotor, spark plug wires, valve adjustment, etc. etc.  I'm pretty sure
this is a dual-port engine and will have the little rubber boots on
the 3-piece manifold; these will probably need to be replaced.

Getting the engine running is only the first part of the fun.  Before
you drive the Bus, you need to inspect the brakes, suspension, and
steering.  It is probable that all the rubber hoses in the brake system
will need to be replaced.

Once the Bus is moving, Clara W. has this procedure which sounds good
to me: check the oil often and change it when it gets black.  You might
make a few oil changes at only 200 or 300 miles or so each, but it
should help to clean out the engine.

>I have bought a bay 68 truck, it has been sitting at least 15 years.

You will probably get more help on the next mailing list over.  This
one (VintageBus) is for '50-'67 Buses.  The other one (Type2) is for
'68-'83 Buses.  If you're subscribed to VB you can post to T2 and
vice versa.  See http://www.type2.com/type2.html for the Type2 list.

Good luck!
