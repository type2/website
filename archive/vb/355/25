You won't find any tires with 8 _actual_ plies in the sidewall that will
fit a bus!

Remember that the "ply rating" was created to equate old tires with cotton
plies with new tires with modern fibers like nylon, fiberglass, steel,
etc.  Most bus tires have two or three actual plies in their sidewalls
and work just fine.
