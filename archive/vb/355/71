Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] the hubcap?

It was at Havasu/Jerome (I think) a year+ ago and I think the Albuquergue 
Air Alliance had it last if I remember correctly.  And I remember not 
remembering much!  Good things I took Pictures.  Last time I saw it it still 
had all writing all over it still!  And we had started mounting show pins on 
it also
