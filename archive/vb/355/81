My old '59 Kombi used to get 24 MPG.

Rebuilt 1600cc DP.
new 34-PICT carb
Mexican bus exhaust.
vacume advance dizzy
stock late 60's swing bus tranny
Big nut Redux boxes.

My first and only engine rebuild. Ran like a "Singer". Great little engine. 
 From what I hear from current owner, still running great.

I drove the bus easy and never really revved the engine high. Most of the 
time kept it at 3000-3500 RPM's in 4th. Might have been part of the 
equation to good gas mileage.
