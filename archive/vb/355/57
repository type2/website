So along with tires, can I ask what kind of oil to use in my bus?

Anyways.....On the 63EZ and the 60Std. I ran Bridgestone Dueler AT's.  If
you like the off road look/tread they are the ticket.  I ran 205/75/15's on
the 60Std. and 205Front and 215/75/15 Rear on the 63EZ.  Awesome mud and
dirt traction and pretty reasonable.  I think I got the ones for the 63 for
$68/tire from tirerack.com.  For the 60 I got them at Costco for something
like $70/tire and at that time Bridgestone had a special with $80 off when
you bought 4 tires.

I got great mileage, little wear and no noise.  I was so impressed by those
tires I put them on my 4Runner and have been very impressed with their snow
capabilities.  I make 20 mile drive on a snow covered dirt road to work
every day(9200ft.).
