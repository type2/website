Subject: Most important of all, . . . these days

Geasy Volks,

We have recurring threads, tires, rims, dizzys, lights, carbs/jets,
etc.  But here's a thread I've not seen on the list in the three years
I've been on:  mpg, or to our friends across the Atlantic and Pacific
ponds:  kpl.

Of course there are a lot of things that impact this statistic,
includes all of the threads mentioned above.  Engine size, carb set up,
tire size (true readings?) cams, heads, spark/ignition/coil, exhaust, .
. . ad nauseum.

I'd like to see some discussion about this, what with $2.50 a
gallon/$1.20 a litre gas/petrol prices.  It'd be nice to see who gets
the best mileage and what their set/up is as far as engine size,
stock/mods and what they are.

I'll start.  Nothing fancy.  I have an 1835, .044 heads, mild 100
degree cam, a Weber progressive carb and a merged exhaust-- no heater
boxes,  and a phat, flo-thru muffler.  I still tend to overheat!

Anyway, my best mpg was down to Moab a last month, 30 mpg, uphill back
home I got 24.  I think my highway ave. is about 26-27.  Thats what I
get overall on the trip between here and BBB.  Worst was around town
with the progressive tuned rich (since corrected) 18 mpg.  Around town
now I get about 20-21.  All this will change later this month when I put
dual 36 Dells on that Art Thraen (Ace Engineering) up in SLC is
rebuilding for me, hopefully my mpg's will improve and I'll run a tad
bit cooler.  Hope, hope!

Okay, let the knu thread begin.  Mileage, in town, on highway, engine
size, stock/mod, setup, whatever you think is pertinent.  Then maybe we
can begin to see a pattern that can potentially be beneficial to the
group as a whole and to the individual pocketbook.

Lets take it to the Arabs who are holding us hostage, by figuring out
what works best.

PLV,
