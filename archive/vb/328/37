Subject: Re: Clutch Pedal Assembly problem

	Has anyone ever had a problem with their clutch pedal assembly
binding. I have the clutch cable removed and the plate and nut that go on
the right of the assembly removed. I just have the bar under the floor and I
am trying to move it back and forth with little luck. I am trying to pull it
out of the sleeve that it is in on the frame to clean it up. Just a few
weeks ago it was fine and now it doesn't move. Any thoughts???



Thanks in Advance,
Eric
