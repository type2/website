Agreed, I did it throughout the restoration, dozens of times on all types
of surfaces and conditions. You spray your system compatible primer at the
2 or 2 and a half hour point, lightly at first, just a feather coat. You
then build it up to a light coating, not heavy, then let the whole affair
dry. The POR cures solid in four hours. You can then add primer or do your
topcoat.

POR makes a topcoating now for the POR15 which they say will interface
with typical topcoating paints.
