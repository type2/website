Subject: Omaha Volkswagen Club Show'n'Shine

The 14th annual Omaha Volkswagen Club Show'n'Shine is being held on Saturday
June 19th with camping two blocks away on Friday the 18th as well as
Saturday night.  As always the proceeds from our raffle are going to the
Make A Wish foundation and with several excellent items including a 1976
Volkswagen Westfalia this year is sure to raise a lot of money for charity
and send most attendees home with some great acquisitions.  If you would
like
to contribute to our raffle and support our cause, please feel free to bring
items the day of the show or send them directly to me.  For directions or
more information please visit www.omahavwclub.com or contact myself at
