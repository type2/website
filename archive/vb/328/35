just checked.  it says a "full minute".

it also says that:
 a) a broken ring will make the same sound, except constantly 
	(which sounds like it could be your problem?)

 b) that loose heads will make a louder pounding sound (although this 
        hasn't been the case in my experience)

(sorry to regurgitate Muir, but it seemed like it might have some use)

good call.  before you pull the heads though, you might try torquing them 
to spec to see if any are completely loose.  "Why not?"

perhaps. but if everything else is w/i spec (bearings, endplay, heads, 
compression) then you don't necessarily need to waste a good case.

FWIW, I bought a new Magnesium case a couple of months ago for $300 here:
