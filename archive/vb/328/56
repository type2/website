Subject: '65 Bug in Distress

Hello All,

Please forgive the lack of bus content...

There is a young man by the name of Gravy who I met recently, with a
beautiful Sea-Blue '65 Beetle.  I gave him my number and instructions to
call for assistance if needed.

Well, he called.  I'm too far from where he is to help him personally, so I
put out this message in hope that someone can help him.

Details:

He's in Visalia, at an aquaintance's place...the number where at least a
message can be left for him is:  (619) 339-2502  (Ted's place).  Ask for or
leave a message for Gravy.  Ted, et al, are just helping as they can.

Symptoms:  Valve train problems, clattering noise, engine overheated, oil
light came on.  He let it cool, tried ajusting valves, found #3 to be all
the way out, clattering noise persists at 2000+ rpm.     I recommended
further diagnosis before driving it further, but he's already driven 30 or
so miles in this condition.  He intends to replace a rocker assembly nut and
drive the bug to a nearby (2 miles) VW shop or store.

He may have a 1300.

He does not have much money, so this is a Karma deal!

Thanks!
