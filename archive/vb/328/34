Subject: Friday: Any Seattle listees want to get together?

All,

After I catch up on two weeks worth of list mail, I am going to a
training class in Seattle next week.  I will be there Monday night
(late), Tuesday and Wednesday nights.  If any area listees would
like to get together for a beer, a soda, or an engine pull, contact
me offlist at mattroberds(-at-)cox.net .  Thanks!

Matt Roberds
