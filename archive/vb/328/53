Subject: Re: Rust Converter's Results and Finding's.

I'm not looking to debate this but I have had great results from the POR
products. Terry on the deep places and pits use the 2 part epoxy filler
sand it smooth, saves leading,  then POR over it, after that use the
primer that they also sell, guess what no sanding, topcoat with paint of
your choice. And by the way I feel that not everyone who uses this is
back yard bam baming,  I think was the term.  I'm done with this now.
