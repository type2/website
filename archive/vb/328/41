Eric,

When was the last time you had it apart to clean and grease it all up? If
it's been a long long time, then it could bind up over a short period if
things are really bad in there. They probably are at this point.

Carefully beat the shaft out of the sleeve, using the nut on the end of
the shaft to protect the threads, etc. Use penetrating oil if necessary to
loosen things up prior to removal. When you get the pedal shaft out, take
a metal brush to the shaft, and also spray a bunch of penetrating oil into
the sleeve to help loosen rust and dirt, and get a metal brush filled with
penetrating oil into the shaft to clean it out. Dried grease, water, rust,
get them all out. Same with the shaft - get it clean and dry.

I grease all the parts well with a good quality wheel bearing grease, and
then reassemble it. If you wanted to be a real champ, you'd drill a
tapered hole to match a grease nipple, and fit one to the assembly. I
can't recall if I use grease or anti-sieze lube in there, prolly grease -
it has a higher load rating.
