Sounds like the classic lower end gon Kapoot to me. Once the block heats
up and the cracks start opening up, the bearings bind or spin, or a
lifter starts seizing.

Tear it down and hope the block is salvagable.

When the engine is cold, it starts quickly and idles fine. It sounds
great, no tapping sounds, no other unusual stuff. As it begins to warm
up, a 'tapping' sound begins, primarily from the left side of the
engine. Once the engine is hot, the tapping sound is quite loud over the
regular sound of the engine. That is my problem.
