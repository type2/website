Yup, several times!

Nope, they're perfectly stable, on time, in time, and in spec!

No, endplay is .004", right dead center spec, hasn't changed in years.

I've had that side open and disassembled the rocker arm assy twice now,
looking for the usual broken or missing parts.

I've used a large screwdriver to stethoscope the engine, and everything
sounds fine, both sides, using it. I touch it to the case just to the left
and right of the oil pump, and on the upper side, left and right of
center, and also the exhaust pipe headers. The sounds sound regular and
normal, though I have no real prior experience at that type of listening.
There are no tapping sounds using that method.
