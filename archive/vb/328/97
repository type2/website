Subject: couple of important (well, to me) questions

hey fellow listees,
 
 
    im now at the satage of putting my engine back together now, and i have a problem.... the firewall tin, how does it go in??? i know it screws on to the other tin, but which way? can someone shoot me a photo of it in place for me?
 
 
  second question,  i just got through doing some wireing in the engine bay, and need to know which wires hook up to the ignition coil thingie. i tried using the vintage bus wireing diagrams, but it only helped so much. i guess the question im asking is, where does the thin black wire that gives power to the turn signals and stuff hook up to? thanks in advance,
josh
