Josh,
If you look at your front tin you will notice that there are two flap
like pieces on both ends with screw holes in them. These have to point
back towards the motor. Up towards the cener of the half moon cutout
that fits around the bell housing there are two angle tabs which clip
over the bell housing and face the tranny.

As far as the wiring goes you need to stretch the harness across the
engine towards the coil and pick off the wires from there. My 67 SC has
back up lights so I have a black wire with a inline fuse connector. That
plugs into #15 or + on the coil. The other black wire is coil positive
which also plugs into the same point, #15 or +. I've had several pre 70
transporters and have had a couple of colors of wire for the oil
pressure sensor, blue or green. You can tell by the length. The carb
idle cut off solenoid also plugs into the coil #15 or +. The other two
wires left over are to the generator. The larger to B+ on the generator
and the smaller to the "F". You may also have a third wire which is
brown. That one will go to the ground screw on the generator just
forward of the generator strap, FIF.

hey fellow listees,


    im now at the satage of putting my engine back together now, and i
have a problem.... the firewall tin, how does it go in??? i know it
screws on to the other tin, but which way? can someone shoot me a photo
of it in place for me?


  second question,  i just got through doing some wireing in the engine
bay, and need to know which wires hook up to the ignition coil thingie.
i tried using the vintage bus wireing diagrams, but it only helped so
much. i guess the question im asking is, where does the thin black wire
that gives power to the turn signals and stuff hook up to? thanks in
advance, josh
