ya... I saw him looking around for a 9mm splash pan bolt.  turns out my westy 
has one 8mm and one 9mm... the 9mm is correct for an earlier bus. 

 oh the shame!!!!!!!!!!  he took pictures too.  
 the offer to trade for an 8mm headed bolt is still open.

I had a good time on Saturday going to my first Woodburn show near
Portland.  Although I thought it was going to be rained out, the weather
broke and was nice from 9 to 1pm when my son and I had to scoot back to
La Grande.  Good seeing a few of you.
