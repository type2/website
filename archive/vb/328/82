Subject: Broken door lock blues...

Greetings fellow bus pilots,

Recently, I discovered that despite my best efforts, I could not get my
driver's side door to unlock after having locked it. After a fit and some
creative coat-hanger'ing, I was able to gain access to drive again, but I am
forced to leave my window cracked to get back in again. So yesterday I took
apart the handle and figured out how the mechanism works, but I cannot
understand how the lock barrel would be removed for repair/replacement.

Is this possible? Any recommendations for volks who could re-key a new
barrel? Or should I just get a new handle entirely?

Thanks!
