Subject: Sightings in Dilbert animated series.

Seems that one or more of the animators of the Dilbert animated cartoon
series has an appreciation of buses.  Just about every time there is a
traffic scene there are several VW buses to watch.  Both splitties and
bays are represented.

I was just watching an episode featuring Stephen Hawking and there is a
scene where Hawking lauches his wheelchair from one ramp to another.
right next to the takeoff ramp is a splitty bus and when the scene changes
to the landing ramp there is a baywindow right there.  Other details
(vents, taillights, etc. also tend to be correct as well
