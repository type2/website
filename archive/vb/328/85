Subject: Re: [VB] 1967 Front Bearing Nut

did you use the nut from the same side... the right spindle thread is a 
mirror image of the left spindle thread.  so the left nuts don't work on the right 
spindles and vice versa.

I've heard from various sources that the late model hex nut for keeping a 
front bearing in place, should work for my '67.

I tried this over the weekend and found that the nut from my '71 didn't 
want to screw onto my front spindle with only fingers used for the 
tightening.  I don't want to force it and strip my spindle, but I'm in a 
bit of a bind and kinda need something RIGHT NOW.
