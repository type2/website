Various methods that may or may not help remove the blockage:

(1) beating on the blocked area with a 2-3lb hammer to free up the carbon
(2) heating blocked area with a propane torch and repeating (1)

(3) turning manifold upside down and filling heat riser tube with solvent.  
    let it soak for a few hours.  Repeat (1) and (2).

At various times, you should try the clutch cable trick again.  The trick 
with the clutch cable, as i recall, is taping the cable near the end 
(1/2-1" away) and getting that 1/2" to fray out.  work in and out of the 
tube slowly.

it is a laborious process, no matter how you look at it.
