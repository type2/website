Subject: Re: [VB] Broken door lock blues...

after you remove the handle, and drive the pin out with a drift, you can have 
the handle bare of the wiggly things.  there is a small set screw, sometimes 
under a dab of blue paint.  unscrew it.   use the correct size screw driver.  
i have a couple tiny screwdrivers altered to fit various set screws.   
sometimes they are frozen.   the tap and penetrating oil method works... twisting 
just erases the slot in the screw.  depending on whats wrong, you may need a new 
handle.   The driver door handle on my 61 went south... turned out the 
protrusion at the end of the cylinder (that pushes the pin thing sideways to not grab 
the tooth that pushe sthe door mechanism ) was bent...  I couldn't see till I 
remoed the cylinder.  I took a cylinder out of a handle in my stash and 
changed the pins to it from the old one, and reassembled.   use grease when putting 
the set screw in.  I use blue nail polish over the spot to seal it from 
water.  (looks original too... like anyone would see it) 

the handle itself is the same 55-64 1/3, but the base changed in 10/60 when 
the door got the indent around the handle.   if you get the style for the other 
style door, you can put your base on it.

Greetings fellow bus pilots,

Recently, I discovered that despite my best efforts, I could not get my
driver's side door to unlock after having locked it. After a fit and some
creative coat-hanger'ing, I was able to gain access to drive again, but I am
forced to leave my window cracked to get back in again. So yesterday I took
apart the handle and figured out how the mechanism works, but I cannot
understand how the lock barrel would be removed for repair/replacement.

Is this possible? Any recommendations for volks who could re-key a new
barrel? Or should I just get a new handle entirely?

Thanks!
