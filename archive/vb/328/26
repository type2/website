Sean,

I don't charge for helping out either, but an engine pull in my yard with my
tools and my help does at least merit some thanks.  I accept pottery,
flowers, food, homebrew.
It's the appreciation that matters, not the payment.  He approached me with
his non-traditional currencies before we even discussed the problem.

I've already done the extended bus-camper in the yard deal.  It was all
pizza boxes and bong hits in the front yard.

If he leaves the bug with me, he leaves a signed title also!

Billy

    I don't usually charge folks if I can help 'em out but I'd tell "Gravy"
that "bread" is what "blow's my mind" not electric chocolate. LOL!

    As far as what you got yourself into; my guess is at least 6 more
roomates! Good luck.

    Sean
