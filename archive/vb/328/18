Nope! It's definitely engine related. Happens with the fanbelt off too.

Actually, it sounds like a valve train issue, though it could be a rod
knocking. Not sure what else to do at this point, but I've got to do
something and quick. I'm thinking of taking it apart to the block and
checking out the conn rods for play and bearing wear. Piston pins, rings,
etc. That could give me a better idea as to what's wrong. I'm gonna check
the rocker assembly again first though.
