Have you performed the classic "rod test" listed in Muir?

(from memory) Rev engine to 2000 (2500?) rpm and hold for 1.5-2 minutes.

Abruptly let off throttle.  Listen for the distinctive rattlesnake sound 
of a rod that's about to throw.  

I can honestly say that the sound is pretty distinctive.  I performed 
the test in the parking lot of a gas station about 10 miles east of 
Cheyenne, on route to Washington DC.  Needless to say, I was unhappy with 
the results.
