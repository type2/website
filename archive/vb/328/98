Subject: RE: [VB] What to do with old lifters?

I took some concaved lifters and some 8mm head studs that had buggered
up threads and ground the threads down and made a rounded point on both
ends of the stud and then welded them into the lifters making a heavy
duty set of tent stakes I can use on rocky ground.

I know you can make a lamp base with an old camshaft & gear.

So what are old lifters good for?
