Hi Eric,
Whoa!!  If you are in San Diego you are in luck!!!!  Look up Butch at Bear's 
VW Machine in the phone book and you can look up old emails about his work in 
the type2 archives.  Last time we heard the cost for a 1641cc SP DR with CW 
cranked and oversized exhaust valve stems to prevent having the dreaded valve 
come apart is about 1,200.00, and if your engine is original you could have them 
rebuild it for you.  They do great work and we have only had a few minor 
problems with his engines, IE too big of oil pressure relief spring and cleaned 
casting flash out of the heads.
  You should be able to dissassemble your engine to a long block and assemble 
the new one yourself easily with basic tools and a good floor jack, which 
will save you a good chunk of $$$.
  We would get a DH fan shroud and tin for your new engine for better cooling 
and if possible have this shroud modified to run the 40% bigger type 4 cooler.
Please tell butch we said "Hi!".
