  Just to let everyone know that Bosch has discontinued the manufacter
of 009 dizzys. The wholesale prices on these
have risen dramaticaly in the last few weeks as the supply goes away.
   If any of you have even given the thought of buying or needing an 009
in the future BUY ONE NOW.  The best deal
out there (I am sold out) right now is from CIP1, they list them at
44.95 plus a 5% internet discount and if you buy 2
FREE FRIEGHT.
