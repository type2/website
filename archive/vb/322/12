Subject: RE: NEW Side Tent  $199 with Floor - OFFER ENDS SAT.

I just received word that our container of side tents has cleared
customs, and is scheduled for delivery to us on Tuesday.  

Accordingly, the $199-with-accessories list member offer on the tents
will end Saturday evening.

For those of you who have pre-ordered one (or are about to), our plan is
to have them out the door via UPS within a few hours of when they
arrive.
