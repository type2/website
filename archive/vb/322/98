I think that depends on where you're from. My bus is shiny and I take it all over the place which is more than I can say for some of the folks in my area who have shiny and non-shiny buses that never go anywhere.  I will have logged 6 shows by this Sunday since january; a few of them had camping as well. 
The other folks I caravan with have at least 2 more shows under their belts than I do! 
Maybe the camping issue has more to do with the popularity of lowered buses these days!
