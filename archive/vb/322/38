Subject: Re: [VB] New Bus (Impact on bearings)

Ya, as I was commiting my acts of violence, I was considering that

remove or install rear axle nuts...that's what my handy 1" drive breaker bar
and 46mm socket are for.

With this bus, however, having been rusting itself solid for well nigh 20
years, it's either suffer a little and live a little more, or die where you
are....some choice, eh?
