Subject: FMBC campouts in 2004 and shirts available for pre-order

For a calendar listing of all the FMBC and many other clubs campouts check

If you are hosting a bus campout and it is not listed, (or just happen to
know all the details)  you can add it without joining :)  Just click on the
forums link on the left hand side of the calendar, scoll to bottom of page
(last 2 topics)  and select whether it is a Bus only event or non bus event.
Then enter in the info.  Please include date and location :)

Also if anyone would like to pre-order a FMBC Tour shirt for 2004, listing
25+ Bus campouts that we host.  Ordering info and the graphic can be seen at
