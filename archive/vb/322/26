Mission accomplished.  I called 4 stores, went to 2 others(after calling
them and them telling me, 'oh yeah, we got GL4....) and the 3rd time was the
charm. Stopped at O'reilly's on a whim and they had GL4 in little quart
jugs.  Must be VW karma, the guy that helped me drives a '71 Fastback, he
knew exactly what I was looking for.   Also, of all the stores I went into,
the guys at O'reillys were super nice, greeted me when I came in and said
bye when I left, they have a new customer now.  Of course buying the gear
oil and then putting it in is another trick too.  Without a suction pump, I
found this funnel/filler that screws on to the end of the gear oil jug, and
with the heater 'silencer/muffler' removed, plenty of room to turn the
little jug upside down and fill 'er up.  Oh, that 17mm plug was in pretty
good, I ended up welding a nut on a 17mm bolt, loosened it great, then could
put the big 17mm allen head wrench to finish the job.
Thanks to all with suggestions on the GL4.
