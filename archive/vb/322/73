Consider contact Beto Pina in SoCal regarding a 63 EZ camper that he may have
for sale. I used to own it and know it to be one of the straightest, driest
buses that I have ever owned. Beto may be located at: type2guy at verizon dot
net. Insert the usual "at" sign and the period for the dot.
Regards and good luck.
