Now that Sta-Lube has been spotted again, and the goo is plentiful, I would
like to share my discovery of a great little pump...$9.99 at Pep Boys...it
sucks it up, and it blows, manually.  Nice for topping stuff up.  Or, if you
find you have too much, it takes it out.

I have an electric 2-way gear oil pump (12v), but that stays at home.
