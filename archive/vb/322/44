Can anyone help this guy? Good mechanic reccomendation, or perhaps some
reassurance of the simplicity of installation and/or help?

>I came across your site today (AIRS) and was wondering if you can help a
fellow vw driver with his baby parked on the street somewhere with a broken
engine.  Yup - today was the last mile .... believed to be the original engine
1970 type II Transporter.

Anyway,  I'm looking for a replacement and a shop that will do the work for
me.  I'm not a mechanic at all.   I've called a few local shops. Volkers and
BRU both say I'm looking at about 3 Grand for a replacement.  --OUCH !

I called ATK - they will ship me a new engine, for around 1500, now I've got
to figure out how to put it in and return the old one.

Any ideas for a local shop or maybe some club members that can recommend a
shop thats fair and does quality work.   I'm heading out now to grab some rope
and a truck to tow her home.

Thanks -
