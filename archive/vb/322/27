That's exactly why I don't go to our local NAPA. Worst customer service 
ever. I only go there as a last resort. Unfortunately they usually have the 
part I need in stock if others don't. Bad thing is I have to hold their 
hand while they try and find it. Losers.

I usually go to O'Reiley's as well. Not perfect, but who is these days!??!
