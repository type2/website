Subject: Re: [VB] Tranny oil, axle boots

I really like the Febi-Bilstein brand... nice flexible rubber, fits the 64-67 
axle tube properly.     Ovals in Federal Way carries them ( I got a pair from 
Ovals at the Puyallup Spring Meet)

Well,
I need to start seriously thinking of adding/replacing tranny oil in my
truck since it is a daily driver. I also have to replace a couple of
boots in the process. From what I heard, there are two sizes of boots.
Which part number do I need for my 67SC?
