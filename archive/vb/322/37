 I doubt that a bra would take anymore than a few hours to make , if even that. One of Toms tilts on the other hand is a more labor intensive project. 
 I'd ask for a refund as it sounds like a bad transaction. In fairness I've bought a few items from the vendor you elude too and never had a problem.
