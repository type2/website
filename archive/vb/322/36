That sucks to get stuck like that for so long...i had a guy on the samba who
after about 3-4 emails regarding condition of objects, agreed to sell me
some windows, all I was waiting for was a shipping cost, I waited and waited
for a price on shipping. He never sent me his address or cost for
shipping...i'm sure he sold to someone else without telling me.
