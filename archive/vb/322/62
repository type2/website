How big are the pump gears? Your oil pressure numbers seem higher than VW 
specs.

Hi Clara,
We are using a 1968-70 vintage EMPI oil filter/pump modified for the DR 
engine case used (larger inlet oil passage drilled into it), and have used 
the 
present day filter/pumps from Claudes's Buggies.

During the winter months when weather stays below 70F we run 10-30 Wt. 
Castrol 
oil, which gives us 30 idling PSI at 160-180F oil temp, and up to 50 PSI 
after 
the first two minutes of driving in weather above 20+ F.  During summer we 
run 
30 Wt. Castrol and run about 20 PSI while idling in most warm weather, 15 PSI
