Subject: Re: [VB] Long trip report

thanks for the trip report!!!!    seems like there are so few these days... 
are people not road tripping, or just not posting about it?   Maybe the summer 
will change that.  The bus scene seems to be more about restoring cars and 
making them shiny, rather than camping and intrepid explorations.  

  Sounds like your rebuild engine has issues... bummer :(   Is it just the 
lousy rebuilder or the bad roads shaking everything loose?   That driving is 
definately harder on the bus than cruising on tarred roads!! (but more scenic) 
Get a later alloy case with the small studs& factory case savers next time, if 
possible.   the later alloy stands up better.   

Clara
