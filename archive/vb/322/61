Subject: Re: [VB] Steering wheel nut

You can make your own die if you have an extra nut and a good hacksaw or 
dremel tool. Cut into the nut at an angle and spread it with a flat 
screw driver or driver bit as a wedge. Thread on with some oil and turn 
all the way down. Take the wedge out and back it off the threads, the 
sharp edge will cut away the mashed threads.
