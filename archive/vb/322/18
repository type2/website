Subject: Re: [VB] Re: manual choke installl in 60-67 bus?

cut and weld in a tube?   I suppose I could use one of the tubes for the 
accelerator cable through the shroud?  

Was there anything tricky about routing the choke cable?    I guess I could 
compare it to under the 59 westy, but there is a lot of junk (um... valuable VW 
parts) under that bus.  Anything to look out for?

Thanks a bunch!!!

Hi Clara,
We did the same with our 1641 SP CW DR DH engine in our 1960 walk thru panel 
camper conversion (AKA Nermal).  That choke cable price is as good as it gets 
and very good quality compared to the NOS ones.  Make sure to pull the new 
cable out if its sleeve and apply a mixture of grease and graphite to the 
cable 
as you slide it back into the sleeve.  Just like you are also supposed to do 
with reserve switch cable if you are installing one or lubing up an old cable 
like we did with Nermal's OG fuel reserve switch cable which turned it from a 
two handed struggle to a one handed easy pull for Barb!
  The hardest part of the choke conversion for us was cutting and welding in 
a tube through the DH fan shroud.  We found the hard way that there was a 
directional fin inside the fan shroud were the 36HP fan shrouds that had the 
choke 
cable through them. Whoops!  So we had to move the tube in the rear of the 
fan shroud slighty down.
  Somewhere we have an original VW ZVW accessory kit to convert a 1960s 
electric choke carb to manual choke.  Unfortunitly Barb put that kit 
somewhere very 
safe and thusly we can not find it now!
