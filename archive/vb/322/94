I think that we don't want to confuse what the
manufacturer says is "oil usage within specs" and what
"normal" or "reasonable" oil consumption should be. 
The manufacturer is going to  give what would
otherwise be considered abnormally high consumption as
still within specs just so they don't have to replace
engines that are a little bit of oil burners due to
dumb driving or maintenance habits.  By the time an
engine is using a quart per 1000 miles, you should
know something is wrong.  I don't have any manuals
handy, but I think that VW has similar specs for
"normal" oil consumption.
