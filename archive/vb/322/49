What compression ratio are you running on that puppy and (if you run gauges) 
what oil temps/pressures are you seeing?  Where are you measuring that temp?
Hi Tommy,
7.1:1 CR, type 4 cooler in modified DH shroud, full flow filter/pump, Porsche 
generator pulley, with largest stock VW crank pulley we can find for more 
cooling fan RPM, and the widest availible cooling fan at 35mm inside measurement. 
 When we got rid of the stock up pulley we went from a stock belt  905 mm  
35.6 inch and 1.8:1 ratio to:
Fresh Start 13345 10AV0875  875 mm  34.4 in (This gave us 2.4:1 pulley ratio)
Gates       7340            864 mm  34.0 in (This gave us (2.75+:1 pulley 
ratio)

 We keep to no higher than 3,000 RPM for cruising, and only go below this 
when shifting up a gear to prevent lugging the engine at 1,500 RPM or below.  
During the winter months when weather stays below 70F we run 10-30 Wt. Castrol 
oil, which gives us 30 idling PSI at 160-180F oil temp, and up to 50 PSI after 
the first two minutes of driving in weather above 20+ F.  During summer we run 
30 Wt. Castrol and run about 20 PSI while idling in most warm weather, 15 PSI 
when weather is in the upper 80s thru the 90s F.  In the latter extremes we 
can get above 210F and back a little off the RPM/MPH cruising speed to keep it 
below 220F.  Top cruising speed is 58 MPH in fourth, 44 MPH in third, 25 MPH in 
second, and 12 MPH in first with P205/75R15s, with P215/75R15 in the rear 
fourth goes up to 61 MPH, but dioes not change the lower three gears.  Freeway 
flier tranny with 3.875 R&P with .82 fourth and 1964-67 RGBs.  Oil temp measured 
at idiot oil pressure sender and has been checked against a vintage German 
made Stork manufactured mechanical oil dipstick gauge and sender.  Which in turn 
has been checked for accuracy with boiling water (212 F) here near Olympia WA 
a few hundred feet above sea level.  Average highway MPG is well above 23!
