During the winter months when weather stays below 70F we run 10-30 Wt. 
Castrol 
oil, which gives us 30 idling PSI at 160-180F oil temp, and up to 50 PSI 
after 
the first two minutes of driving in weather above 20+ F.  During summer we 
run 
30 Wt. Castrol and run about 20 PSI while idling in most warm weather, 15 PSI
