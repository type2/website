Been there, although it was more forward than back.
When I drove 3 hours north to pic up my '67 Panel I
had to hire a car trailer.
My brother was with me & we hit the golden arches for
an unhealthy breakfast.
I slid into 2 parking spots end to end with a BMW 5
series on the left hand side of the car trailer and a
locally built GM prestige car on the right of my
pickup I was using to tow.
When we went to get out....you guessed it.
The car trailer was wider than my pickup and I created
a 9 inch paint scrape down the GM's rear side trim.
I left my name & number for the owner & she was
overwhelmed by my honesty.
Strangely, I gave her my insurance number but she
never claimed on it.
Maybe fessing up made her decide not to follow it up.
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
