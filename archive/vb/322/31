Subject: Re: [VB] Friday: Weird sighting in new commercial (was old

I have a Directv satellite for my TV and get a CBS
feed from New York City channel 2.  They show a
commercial for the New York Lottery that shows an "old
hippie" type character sitting next to his split
camper.  Hard to tell which camper it is, but it's
interesting.
