I feel your pain!  As a vendor of a similar product(tilt Canopies) I know
the hardest part of the business is getting my product to the customer when
promised. That's the reason that I try not to take any $$$ until the product
is done so that customers won't think I am walking w/ their $$$.

You never know what's gonna affect your ability to deliver-right now I am
competing w/ the US Govmint, who walked into the factory & requisitioned
every canvas tent they had in stock for the armed forces in hmmmmmm- where ?
What does that mean?

I loved the song- hang in there!
