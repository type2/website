Whats Sta Lube??

Something like Red Line product's?

Is the gizmo Cal like a screw in spring loaded pump, that you push down
on to get the oil into the trans ?

If so--I've been using a Mercury Marine lower unit pump that works the
same--
I got it at a ships store to put the gear oil in the outdrive--works
great with any gear oil.
For 5 bucks it's a great tool to have in stock.

Gary,
Sta-Lube brand makes and sells not only GL-4, but also a handy pump
device that fits their GL-4 tranny bottles. I have one I've been using
for over twelve years, plus a spare just in case.
