Hi Clara,
The vintage EMPI filter/pump has gears about 1.280" diameter by 1.260" long.  
The Claude's Buggies filter/pump has gears about 1.280" by 1.023" long.

  As for VW specs for oil pressure all we have been able to find is:
Oil pressure (only for SAE 30 oil) temperature of 70 C (158 F) : at 2,500 RPM

New installation mm (inch)    pressure approx. 3 kg/cm squared (42 psi) 
Wear limit mm (inch)    2 kg/cm squared (28 psi)

So if you are going off the above info.  We are doing 3,000 RPM so that is 
going to add some pressure increase.

  BTW we went through our old accessory literature and found the instructions 
for installing the manual choke in the 1966 VW type 1 & 2 models!  Whoo 
Hoo!!!  Anyone have installation instructions for any VW accessories who want to 
trade info for this or other stuff?!?!?Eric&Barb
