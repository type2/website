yea... I know... but ya gotta think about it for a
minute... first off, the bus needs to be raised a few
inches cause we go campin sumtimes way off the beatin
path, second, Ill have a/c while on the road or
campin, itll have backup electric heat should we run
out of propane, and lastly, when shore power aint
available, itll have its own source of 110v :) yea...
I know flames are inevetable... but like at the last
campout when we took the generator, alot of folks
would walk up and ask if they could "borrow" sum
electric...
