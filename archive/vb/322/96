Subject: WTB: Used Type-1 Engine near SLO, CA

Volks,

Does anyone have a good, used type-1 engine for sale in the San Luis
Obispo, CA area?  It must have the mounting holes for a 68-71 mustache 
bar.

I'm flying out there in a few weeks to help a friend with his '71 and if
we find that the engine is shot, I want to know if there's a spare engine
I can pick up in the area that weekend (as that weekend is all I've got).

Hopefully it won't come to that as it's a fairly fresh rebuild (who knows
from where though), but it's good to know what my options are.

Please forward as appropriate.

Thanks,
        Tom
