Is it cheating to ask a libarian? You know, from the libary.

Bus content: The Fresno area VWFLAPS is having their annual open house/sale today, 4/16. Stop by Sebring West on Blackstone north of McKinley. Free goodies, hot dogs, sodas. They blow out some parts too. I bought a jack point side step for $25 last year. 

Also on the calendar is the Madera Spring Fling, Sunday April 25th. At the Madera Fairgrounds on the grass and under the trees.
