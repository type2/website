Hi Matt,
For wide five rims with 1971-79 discs you have to install adapters.  Check 
Wolfgang Int. for those.  As for the MC you need to install a 1971-79 bus MC 
because the discs require more volumn of brake fluid and MUST install the brake 
pressure regulator to the rear drums.  See Bentley Official Service Manual for 
1968-79 bus, Chapter 8, pages 11-13 for this.  Without the brake pressure 
regulator the rear brakes WILL lock up in panic braking before the front discs and 
the bus WILL tend to try to spin so the front will be reward and the rear 
forward especially in wet or icy weather conditions.  
  BTW 1972-79 discs have improved parts over the first year 1971 discs.
