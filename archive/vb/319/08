Subject: Front Beam / Brake Upgrade

Hi all, 
  I  know this topic has been covered, but I could not find all the details.  I would like to install a '68 front beam in my '63 bus.  I located a '68 beam for $125, seems like a reasonable price.  It is complete minus the brakes, and seems to be in good condition.
 I would like to use this beam, add the adjusters to allow lowering, and upgrade to disk brakes for the wide five pattern.  I assume the rotors are aftermarket, but can the other brake parts( calipers, backing plates, etc) be scavenged from other year and/or models for this conversion?  Also, I assume this would be an ideal time to upgrade the master cylider.  Is the '67 model adequate for the disks?
 
Thanks in advance,
 
Matt Faust
