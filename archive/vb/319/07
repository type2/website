Tom,

A few thoughts.  Do you want it done quickly?  Let him do it.
If you've never done it before, it is a lot of work.  $200
seems like a bargain.  Then again, $200 is a lot of money
just to pull everything out and reinstall.

I know this probably sounds corny, but do you want to
give your son the experience of learning along side his
dad?  My dad and I had NO experience restoring cars
15 years ago, but that's just what we did to our 73 bug.
We learned along the way and I got to spend some really
good times (and frustrating ones) with my dad while we
worked through the problems together.  Owning a VW
is (to me) a family experience.  My older daughter (8 y.o.)
knows what a valve gap is and is able to help me whenever
I work on that car now.  Once I start restoring my crew cab,
she'll be right along side me helping to sandblast, weld, run
new wiring or whatever else.

If you can afford for the bus to be off the road for a while,
you could probably do it, but you'd need probably (this is a
wag) about another $50 in tools (like the wrench and a 46mm
socket) and a lot of hand cleaner and gloves.

The other problem is that once you get the trans out of the bus,
how are you going to get it to your buddy?  If he pulls it, it will
already be there.

Having said all that, I'd let him do the work.  Take the time to
go fishing with your son or take him to a ballgame.

Paul
