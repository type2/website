Subject: EveryBus 2004 - Been there done that!

Well folks last night I went up to the park let myself in and after a few 
minutes I was surrounded by Buses. I got there about 9:30 PM and there was 
already about 50-60 buses. Me in my big work truck, what a drag I couldn't 
drive "el Verde". To all of those ducking out of site from the "Park Ranger" 
in the Red Truck with reflective Yellow Lettering, sorry. Didn't mean to 
kill it for you. At least I didn't use the spot light.  ;) Took that Webber 
off and met John Baker. Great guy brought me a Complete Fuel Injection off a 
78. Perfect, exactly what I was looking for. He seemed right at home with 
the progressive carb. Good luck to you BUSZEN. I can't say I was the first 
one there but, first to leave? Wish I could have stayed but work on Friday 
would not allow it. All this important stuff to do at work. Like check my 
emails for "List Material". LOL. Looks like it is going to be a great event 
with the turn out so far.
