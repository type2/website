Subject: Clutch thump

This is the second clutch that does this, but when I clutch to shift I get a 
thump sound, only when engaging under load.  In other words, shift into 1st, 
no thump.  Clutch to shift into second, thump.  Release clutch, no thump, 
Clutch for third, thump, ect.  9 spring and now diaphram, same thing, only 
thing I haven't changed is the TOB, no noise when clutch is engaged, no 
noise when released when not under load.
