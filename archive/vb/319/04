Subject: body repair made easy

well the content is marginal bus related, but who doesn't carry at
least one roll of duct tape in their bus, plus I will be at Everybus
Friday. Now you don't have to try and find that matching color of tape
to match your paint :)

The latest solution for quick, easy home repairs will go unnoticed,
and that.s the beauty of it. The most recent addition to the Scotch
duct tape family is the development of the first-ever transparent duct
tape.

Like all Scotch duct tapes, the new transparent duct tape is strong
enough to tackle almost any repair project in or around the home,
vehicle, boat or job site. The clear benefit is that this duct tape is
transparent when applied, making repairs less noticeable. Scotch
transparent duct tape also lasts six times longer than other
heavy-duty duct tapes, based on accelerated weathering, providing
peace of mind that the repair will last a long time.
