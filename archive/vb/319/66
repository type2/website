All,

I put in the new seal,  more carefully this time -- I checked the bore
for rough spots and lubed everything before assembly.  Hit the clutch,
pressure plate, and flywheel with generic AutoZone brake cleaner, which
seemed to do the job.  It's all back together and no drips so far...in
a few days I'll know for sure.

Lesson somewhat learned: If it ain't broke, don't fix it...

Thanks for all the responses!
