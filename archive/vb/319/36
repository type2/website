Subject: Nike's MOJO mania tour split window bus will be in Elkhart,

Just thought I would mention that the Nike's MOJO mania tour split
window bus will be at Nick's Golf Center in Elkhart Indiana on Sunday,
April 18th from 2:30 to 5:30 according to the ad in the South Bend
Tribune.  I hope to make it over to see it but am not sure if I'll make
it.  According to the Nike rules of the contest is over and the winner
is to announced any day now.  I wonder if someone in Elkhart won it??
Anyway, just thought I would mention this to anyone close enough and
wanted to see the Bus.



Kevin
