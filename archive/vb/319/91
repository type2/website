 Does it have the split shafts for the pre-1968 knobs or the ones 
shaped 
more like a "D"?  As for what band or bands, you need to look at the 
face where 
the needle is and take note of the radio frequency numbers there and 
either 
list them to us or compare them to other radio faces you do know.   IE 
FM band 
goes from 88 thru 104, in comparison AM goes from 570 thru 1600.  

 
 
it has split shafts with black rubber nobs.   the bands say 5 (with a little 4 next to it) 7 9 11 13 15 16. so i guess its AM? does anyone know how to hook it up in my 67? my dad wont help me, so im relying on y'all as i dont want to screw anything up. thanks again for all y'all's help.
