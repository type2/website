Subject: Re: [VB] new/repro/recast  steering wheels??

Ronnie asked:
 wasn't there somebody on the list a while back making new steering wheels on
 the core of originals?

 also, anybody have any experience with isp west wheels? or any other for that matter?

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, Chris Dreicke [not sure about the spelling], AKA the steering wheel man, was making them.
I bought his last one about a year ago....  I am not sure if he will go back into producing them.

The ISP wheels are from Flat 4.  I was going to buy one before I bought Chris's but I passed on them. They are
very flimsy. Factory wheels and Chris's wheels are firm in your hand when you push on the top or bottom. The
Flat 4's have a lot of give to them. I did not like that at all. It is as though the metal core is half as
thick......
