Subject: RE: [VB] [F] any UK listees want to get me some beer?

Ah, but you see, when you put a bus on a boat, they don't like to see
anything out in the open so it all has to be concealed, or at least that
is what I was told.  Ultimately, I bought my firebus when I did because
I was running out of trappist.  I figured I could get a BUNCH of beer in
it.  And then I was told I couldn't put anything in it.  Bummer.

Now the funny thing is, when I got the tipper, I found 12 or so 14" bus
rims in the back, all just laying there in the bed.  If you look at any
of the old pictures of it at BBTs, you can see the rims.  A year goes by
after I bought it and Bob emails me one day and asks if all those rims
were in the tipper to which I replied 'yes'... "that's where they all
went" he said!  Seems one of his minions didn't take them out before
they shipped it off!  Nowadays, if someone is need of a specific date
code 14" bus rim, they get it for free!  Compliments of me and Bob.

Not the treasure chest, in the bed! I see a case of beer measures about
18"x12"x11" if that helps.
