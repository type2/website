Subject: BYOB show pics

go to vintagebus.com and search for "BYOB 2004" in the gallery.  Sorry, some 
are a bit big, I should have checked before up-loading, but it's too late now. 
  there are nice stand by (or behind) your van pics, and I like the mango 
trio.

Great campout/show.   A splendid time was had by all.
