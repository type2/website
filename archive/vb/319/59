I got a couple of emails from people who couldn't find the coupon code
field.  My bad. We actually call it a REFERRAL CODE on the wbesite, not
a "coupon" code. It's on the first checkout page when you go to check
out your order. (It used to be on the "view cart" page but has now been
moved to the checkout page.)
