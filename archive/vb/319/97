Subject: Re: [VB] oil relief plug removal help

You need the super big fat screwdriver.   I have one that used to have wood 
on each side of the handle and fits the slot properly.   Then I put a pair of 
vice grips on the flats parts of the handle.   Push up and turn.   Not much oil 
falls out.  If the plug is messed up, I am sure many listees have spares.

Hi all - So far I've broken my regular big screwdriver, and my largest 
impact spade bit trying to get this plug loose.  The plug has suffered 
some damage as well.  The thing will not move! (even though it is 
covered in oil :)  It's on a 1500 sp.

Thanks
