i agree with the veewees and the bowden tube... and also the tube 
MOUNT on the side of the tranny; my 70 has a brand new bowden tube, 
but i still have that WHUMP when changing gears where the damn clutch 
just grabs faster than it should. went underneath and i could wiggle 
the tube around quite a bit in that little saddle-on-a-post bracket 
there. like 60 deg or more off center, either side. the bracket 
itself is pretty wallered out (technical term).  i put on 3 of what 
lewis calls 'rabbit brake widgets' which are shaped like little 
tuning forks, and help force the bowden tube closer to the proper 'S' 
curve, but the end still wiggles too much, so i need to buy a new 
bracket.

for several web pages on the subject, here ya go:
