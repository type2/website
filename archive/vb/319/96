If this plug is the same sort of thing that's on a Vanagon engine here's the
"tool" that I made for the job:

Went down to Ace Hardware and got a 3-foot length of 1" wide mild "weldable
steel."  It's a flat bar whose thickness is almost exactly the width of the
slot.
Cut off about a foot of the bar.
Radiused the end of the 1 foot length of bar to fit the slot in the plug.
(The slot is mildly crescent-shaped so a "square" end won't fit properly.)

Using one hand pushing on the square end of the tool and the other hand on a
crescent wrench right up near the radiused end, these things come out
easily.
