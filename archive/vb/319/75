Subject: [VB] Re: gas tank leak

Thanks to Clara & others who responded about my gas tank leak.

I got one of those new brazilliam black tanks which have the 
reinforcements on the filler neck.

Pulled the old tank and saw that it had a 1/2" crack in the bottom near 
the fuel tap.  The tank looked nice a clean otherwise no rust to be seen 
  most likely owing to the fact that the bus spent most of its life in CA.

The new tank fit well, the filler neck was closer to the top of the 
metal bracket near the fuel door as opposed to the old tank which was 
near the bottom.  The only thing I didn't have was a new piece of rubber 
that sits at the bottom.  I fashioned something up in its place.  The 
old one was soaked with gas and fell apart in my hands.

Naturally, PO had removed the screen from the fuel tap and sawed of the 
tube a bit.  A new fuel tap & screen felt good to install..

I believe that I could have saved time & money here by __not__ using the 
non-vented gas cap.  I believe that it caused undo pressure both when 
the tank expanded and by creating a vaccumm inside the tank as fuel was 
consumed.  I am still using the non-vented gas cap but putting it on in 
a manner that will allow breathing.  I plan on drilling a hole or 
something in it for venting.

It took a day for the gas smell to abate from the bus - yuck.  I think I 
am still getting a _tad_ bit of fumes from the fuel sender. Maybe a bit 
of silcone around it may take care of that.

It was nice to have the bus driving this weekend.. If anyone wants a 
free tank that could probably be repaired let me know.

thanks again list..
