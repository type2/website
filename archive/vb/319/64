AFAIK, only Chris Dreike recasts the wheel with entirely new material 
over an original armature, or steel core.  Koch will fill and paint a 
wheel, but is isn't recast from an NOS-made mold like Chris's. Hard to 
get the worn down nubs out to snuff.
The flimsy repop steering wheels turned up just as Chris started 
producing a quality product after a LOT of work on his part to get it 
right. I bought two of his wheels, the one in my '63 DC daily driver is 
doing fine after all kinds of abuse.
I have a core or two to return to him from junkyard finds.. If you have 
any badly damaged splitty steering wheels, save 'em for Chris.
