Subject: RE: [VB] Rear Fender Lines-

Hi Mark,

Those rear 'round' fender cutouts are a very rare M-code option (ok
people, who has that list of special m-codes)....

But really, people cut those fenders out to put big tires on the back of
the poor bus, a thing of the 60's and 70's and hopefully an idea fully
banished now from the human brain.

They should be flat.

David




Mark Koontz ponderd: Sorry for the newbie question-  Why do I see some
buses with round(ed) rear
fender cutouts and others with flats (that partially cover the wheel)?
