Subject: oil relief plug removal help

Hi all - So far I've broken my regular big screwdriver, and my largest 
impact spade bit trying to get this plug loose.  The plug has suffered 
some damage as well.  The thing will not move! (even though it is 
covered in oil :)  It's on a 1500 sp.

Thanks

Don J
