Subject: Perhaps a dumb questuon

My son's 66 bus is popping out of 4th gear. My local VW mech. said to take
it to the gentleman who rebuild it
awhile back.(This is not a warrenty issue) We are friends, but he laughed at
me when I asked him if he would pull the engine and trans and reinstall them
later after the trans is repaired. "It is so simple why don't you and your
son do it?".He even showed me what to do on a dune buggy, we were leaning on
while "discussing" this issue. I have average mech. skills (my son zero)  Is
it really that simple??Do we need to get a book and do it ourselves? I have
a set of tools metric and SAE but nothing fancy. I often see chatter about
some special 17mm wrench, trouble with seals,etc,etc. My buddy finally said
if I insisted he would pull both, store the bus and reinstall both for $200,
since this shop is his livehood, it sounded resonable to me.
Advise more than welcomed
