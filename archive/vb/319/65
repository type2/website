Subject: sapphire radio

hey all,
 
  when i got my 64 camper, it came with an old sapphire VII radio. i dont know if it works or not, as i dont know how it hooks up, but anyways, i was wondering if it is an am or fm radio? it has a 12 volt and 6 volt switch in it. also, how much do you all think it would be worth? thanks in advance.
