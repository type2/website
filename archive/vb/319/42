HI JT,
Sounds like you are not getting the RPMs between the engine and the 
transmission just right.  When this thump occurs does the bus surge in a decellerating 
or accellerating way?  It does take quite some practice to get the correct gas 
pedal action to clutch and/or not shifting quickly that the engine is still 
coming down from the upper RPMs while the higher gear you are shifting into is 
needing a much lower engine RPM.
  The only other thing we can think that would possibly cause this, is not 
having the proper curve in the clutch boden tube.
