It's definetly slim pickins here in Chicago for ACVWs.
 There is a guy near Grace & Pulaski that works on
them.  I met him and he is a nice guy.  There is also
a guy on the 5100 block of Western but I think he is
semi-retired and I have not heard good things.  I
usually work on things myself when possible.

The closest VW parts house is Mid-America in Effingham
and MOFOCO in Milwaukee.  I not like either. 

Chicago is pretty weak in the VW scene, probably due
to the rust factor and not too many have survived the
salt.  I would be happy to meet you over a beer and
talk VWs.
