Subject: If Saturday then contest over...

Promised not to post on Friday but hey...

Folks have been asking me to make sure that I
officially announce when the contest is over.
Pfft! like I'm going to stay awake until it's midnight
in Hawaii? Get real...

Do it this way. If you wake up and it's Saturday,
September 25, 2001 then the contest is over. Otherwise
look at the clock in your timezone. If it's midnight
then go to bed. If on crank then figure out Hawaii's
midnight time and post away. Then call Betty Ford.
