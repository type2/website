BULLCRAP!!!   He needs to read a bay owners manual.
From my 77 type2 owners manual, page 51:

''Tires
Your VW is equipped with tubeless radial tires of either designation:

185 R 14 C 6 PR
or 185 SR 14 Reinforced''

Any time you see a R in the middle of the size, it means Radial. That is the
standard marking system worldwide. [The '6 PR' on the end of the 1st tire listed
means 6 Ply Rating.]

If he starts off with wrong info, I would not put much faith in the rest of
it......
