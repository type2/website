A bit tricky, but it can be done.  You need a stubby regular screwdriver and a large paper clip or bobby pin.  Work on the top one first, as 
it is easiest to see.

Each brush has a copper braid pigtail that is its electrical connection.  This is attached to a cheese-head screw.  You need to remove the 
screw completely.  Make sure that the screwdriver is perfectly engaged with the screw before applying torque, as you don't want to 
damage the screw!  Once the screw is out (don't drop it!) you need to pull the tensioning spring back with a bent wire and then the brush 
simply pulls out of its holder.  Once the brushes are out, get some 200 grit emery cloth and hold it against the commutator while turning 
the pulley (take belt off so things can spin).  If you can clean up the commutator so it is smooth and shiny, great, otherwise you need to 
pull the generator and get a rebuilt.  Install the brushes in the reverse order of removal.

I found that an old Beetle rearview mirror makes seeing the lower brush much easier, but you'll probably need to use several blue words to 
get it out.
