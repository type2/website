Subject: Re: [VB] truck drivers on my road trip :(

As long as you were staying in the right lane no one
has any right to be mad at you.  I have traveled and
European roads are much easier to drive on because
people respect the fact that the left lane is only for
passing.  Only in America will people creep along at
75 mph and force you to pass on their right.  This
problem is especially bad in Wisconsin where people
hauling trailers and boats just LOVE to poke around in
that left passing lane.  One of my best pet peaves and
I have many  :-)  I usually either the fastest or
slowest on the road, depending on which vehicle I
drive and when I drive my bus I keep to the right.
