Subject: Part needed.

I am missing the half-moon piece that goes in the housing of my 67 turn signal
switch. I know 66 and 67 are the same...not sure about 65 and back. I know 68
and up bay will not work, the column is larger in diameter, tried it......
Anyone have one laying around? I don't need the housing or the t.s. switch, just
the silver half-moon.
