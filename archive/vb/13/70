Subject: Re: [VB] 1967 Bus Turn Signal Switch

We did have some problems with left brake light not working on this
trip. Our solution was to spray lots of Radio Shack contact cleaner into
the switch contacts disassembled and protecting the surroundings from
over spray.  Reassemble and all was better again.
