Subject: Vintage nazis ruin Hippy Bus

Man, I'd hate to see this happen, imagine if the J. Jess was not cool and
painted over Bessie!  Problem is there is good and bad hippy stuff out
there, don't ruin the good stuff...shamefull and sad to hear people with
vintage transporters be such fucknozzles.

Best,
