Subject: Re: [VB] My new find

It seems unlikely that Jerry ever owned a bus. It just doesnt fit. (In fact 
some members of the band were into much faster cars if into vehicles at 
all). Photo history does not lead anyone to believe that he personally owned 
a bus. There is some mention of a VW BUS being used by the band as a vehicle 
to get from one show to home, but not that he or anyone in the band owned 
it.

This being late (very late friday, technically Sat but tough, kick me) Ill 
tell a story that relates to that vw bus (sort of).

The Grateful Dead were playing a show (circa late 60's).
During the show someone kept yelling from the crowd to play Saint Steven. 
After hearing this over and over, Jerry finally stepped up to the mike and 
said "Look, we played that last night, and we will probably play it again, 
but not tonight. You can buy it on our album if you want to hear it again".
Someone else took offense to this, thinking Jerry was too hard on this 
person.
SO he waited outside the backstage door to tell him what he thought. He 
rehearsed what he was going to say over and over in his mind.
Jerry appeared at the end of the show on his way to go home.
This guy started to say, "You were hard on that guy in the crowd. Look Man, 
Ive been with the Dead a long time..."

And as Jerry was getting into a VW BUS he interupted the guy and said:
"Yeah? Well Ive been with them longer"!

He got into the BUS and that was that!
