Subject: GL4 was: Parts stores

I remember reading a thread that discussed gear oil for trannys. The tread
said something about GL5 shouldn't be used for VW trans because eats the
brass synchros or something like that.

I talked to Rick Long about this and he said this was not the case. He said
that GL5 was the only oil you could use _if_ your brass parts were moly
coated. However VW brass parts are not moly coated and therefore GL4 or GL5
is fine.

Is he right or wrong?

Those stores seem to be mostly in the western half of the US:

Advance Auto Parts is apparently part of the same company, but I don't
know if they honor Schuck's/Kragen/Checker warranties or vice versa.
They seem to be mostly in the eastern half of the US:

Around here (OK/MO/KS/TX/AR), O'Reilly and AutoZone are fairly popular.
O'Reilly is mostly in the midwest and south central states:

AutoZone has pretty decent nationwide coverage:

oreLocator

NAPA seems to have locations nationwide, but their locator doesn't show
a general map.  Their stuff seems to be a bit spendy, but usually pretty
good.  (They are a good place for GL-4 gear oil.)
