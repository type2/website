Those stores seem to be mostly in the western half of the US:

Advance Auto Parts is apparently part of the same company, but I don't
know if they honor Schuck's/Kragen/Checker warranties or vice versa.
They seem to be mostly in the eastern half of the US:

Around here (OK/MO/KS/TX/AR), O'Reilly and AutoZone are fairly popular.
O'Reilly is mostly in the midwest and south central states:

AutoZone has pretty decent nationwide coverage:

NAPA seems to have locations nationwide, but their locator doesn't show
a general map.  Their stuff seems to be a bit spendy, but usually pretty
good.  (They are a good place for GL-4 gear oil.)

Standard disclaimer: I don't work for any of the above companies.
