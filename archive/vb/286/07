Subject: Any listees in or around Atlanta, GA

Hi volks,
I need a favor.  I need to get a stripped type 1 engine down to Atlanta, GA
to get to Adrian Pillow.  I have a girl I work with that is heading down
there for the race this Wed-Mon. Problem is Adrian is in Va for the next two
weeks.

Anyone down there that could pick up the engine from a campground  near
Atlanta?  The engine has no carb, no fan housing, no generator, no flywheel
and no heater boxes so is relatively small and light.

I'd appreciate it immensely and can compensate you for your time.

Let me know ASAP,
Snoopy vwsnoopy(-at-)knology.net

Thanks in advance...
