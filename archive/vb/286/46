Matt,

Thanks for your suggestions - as usual, they are excellent. I mulled the
same possibilities over in my mind last night, and I've decided to try the
quick-fix, being to replace the starter, as it's quick, but not cheap. If
it doesn't work, I've got a new spare, and next weekend to do all of your
suggestions, and narrow it down. If necessary, I'll run with the manual
clip-on connections til a replacement switch comes in. Ignition switch is
one of the few items I don't carry; strange isn't it? Maybe I'll pick one
up with the starter (be a good idea at this point!).

Thanks again!
