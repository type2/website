Subject: Re: [VB] Solex 34 PICT-3 with 009 distributor

After watching this debate for a number of years also, each distributor/carb
combo has it's pros and cons. I am also thinking that the reason the
34PICT-3 combination and 009 distributor may be given a bad rap is that the
some of parts used may be well worn making the hesitiation and adjustment
issues worse and non-fixable. In my own case, it took a 3rd rebuilt 34
PICT-3 to work in conjunction with the 009 and get all the adjustments right
on the money. My carb is also not set "fat", and the hesitation is not
there.... spark plugs, temp, exhaust color and mileage all proper.

My definition of "fat" is a vintage two barrel Bug Spray on a 1600 cc DP
getting 13 mpg.... wonderful!!
