Subject: Brake & Shift(Minor) issue??

I drove the bus a bit for the second time today.  Our house backs up to school
property and they've wore in a road of sorts to get to the football fields.  I
was able to get it in 3rd and some speed for the first time.  gave me a chance
to see if the tires would rub with the 2 1/2 drop spindles, did OK.

Here's the issue that I'm fairly sure is a brake thing.  I was easy it beside
the house and notice a dragging sound when going forward.  tried it several
times and it done each time in forward.  New brakes, cylinders, wheel bearings
etc...  I can adjust must the brakes most of the way off and 95% of the sound
goes away.  Question is what do I look for when I pull the wheel?  Maybe a
show dragging?  Slipped off of the retainer?  rock in the shoe?

Also the tranny seems to slip into 1st and 2nd better when the engine is
slightly revved above idle.  Clutch need further adjusting?
