Hi Diana,
Yes, you can, but do not let it hang from the flex brake line.  You might 
need to slide a cinder block under the spindle/brake drum assembly.  Loosen the 
lug bolts on that wheel, jack up and install a jack stand then, take off the 
wheel first!  Then proceed getting into there and adjusting the link pin shims.

  I'm also not sure of the torque specs (if there are any) for the bolts 
holding the > king and link pin assembly in place.  Forgive me if I'm getting the

Best you do this yourself!  Plus it really is not that hard to do, but YES 
you really need to the the Bentley reprint of the VW shop manual for 1963-67 
bus.
