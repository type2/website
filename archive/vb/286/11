Subject: Solex 34 PICT-3 with 009 distributor

I am considering using the Solex 34 PICT-3 with a 009
distributor on a 1600 DP in a 67 Westy.  I've read
about problems with hesitation using this combination.
 I checked the archives and learned a bit more.  My
questions are 1)where do I get carburator jets (main
and air) if I go with re-jetting and 2)what
distributor should I use with the 34 PICT-3 if I don't
use the 009? Is there a better carb/dist setup?  I
have a 111 205 905M distributor I can use too.  What's
the latest opinion?  
Thanks
