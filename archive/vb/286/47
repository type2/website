  Any dizzy will work with any carb set-up, period. You can set up an 009 to
work beautiful and get great mpg or a single, duel vaccum pull. I have had
good luck? with all three styles and do not have a preference. I don't mind
a little sacrifice in mpg for performance and the 009 does do that. 
  My wifes car, 65 bug (NEW Mexi 1600 with a mileage maker cam) runs a hell
of a lot better with an 009 then with the SVDA 74 bug dizzy I have in it
now. No temp changes, just slower acceleration and a weaker top end but
still gets 28+ mpg on the highway with EITHER dizzy.
   I have had it to the top of my bald head on all this dizzy crap. 019,
010, 029,050, 009, single pull, duel pull on and on and on. They all work
for different applications and PEOPLE.
   I am getting ready to dyno another 1800 engine with the new duel 34 pict
solexs. I am going to try every damm dizzy I have and I have a lot of them
and see what the true specs are on each and every one of them hp and torque.
   You have to remember that the vacumm signal on a VW engine changes with
timing and cam used, valve size, load etc. 
   Remember the old days when you use to buy the mileage minders with the
green, yellow and red marks? These were just vacumm gauges with the green
being optinum mileage and the red the worse. If you really want to get the
best gas mileage install a vac gauge. You WILL be surprised at what you
see!!!!!!

ronnie   long live the 009

ps. One of my suppliers told me that they might stop making 009's, I doubt
it though being that they are coming back out with NEW 010 along with the
050 that are still available.

You don't want to use that carb with the 009 distributor.  The only bus
('71) that came with the 34 carb used a dual-vacuum distributor
