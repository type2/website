Yes, I went.  There was a really solid '68 Beetle that went for $90.  
It had an engine, totally solid rockers, good floors, all glass, radio, 
etc.  Very complete.  What a deal.  There were about three dozen other 
cars, mostly rusted out crap.  A nice looking late Ghia which had a lot 
of bondo in it, a few split buses w/ lots of rust, including a 23 
window.  That '68 was the nicest cheap car.  I left before the type 3 
ghia was sold.  It wasn't too bad, but had been repainted a gross 
orange.

Parts?  I pretty complete 1600 DP engine, a dozen other engines in 
various states, including several 36 HPs.  A new Danish full length 
rocker assembly w/ heater channel went for $10!  Most of the rest of 
the parts were small cardboard boxes fill of misc crap, like you might 
find in the attic of a VW guy.

I spent only $28, and I'm a nut for buying old crap that I might need 
someday.  That should tell you something.
