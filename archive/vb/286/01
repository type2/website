Check the dwell with a tach/dwell meter.  If that's OK, I'd say to first
change the points+condenser and see if that helps.  If that doesn't help,
change the coil.  I have seen a failing condenser behave like this.
Also, it's part of a healthy tune-up, and is probably cheaper than the
coil anyway...
