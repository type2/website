Subject: Aircon applications for buses

Has anyone tried to use small aircon units like those
used on T(-at-)yota, Hy(-at-)ndai & other compact cars for
aircon on their buses?
I imagine they wouldn't suck too much power on flat
terrain although some sort of extra cooling(external
oil cooler) may be needed.
I'm looking to replace the heater boxes ultimately
with a full climate control system(cooling & heating)
to at least take the edge off summer & provide
immediate heat in winter.
And yes it does get freakin' cold where I live in
Australia.
Even snows some winters.
I believe gas and petrol heaters are persona non grata
here in Australia as well being extremely difficult to
get a hold of & subsequently very expensive.
I suppose I could go nuts with insulation on the heat
exchangers but that doesn't create immediate heat on
those freezing winter mornings and that also isn't
addressing the summer heat.
Any hints?
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
