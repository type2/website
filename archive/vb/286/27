Hi Steve,
Sounds like a good idea!  We have had some wierd fuel problems due to rust.  
Our SO-34 flip seat would not start when we first tried to get it driving out 
of the wrecking yard we found it in, with a known good engine and it turned 
out the metal line under the fuel tank was completely rusted shut.  Also rust 
can dissolve and reform into something like a pearl.  Eric twice had this happen 
with a 1970 autostick bug in the main jet.
