Subject: Propex Heatsource

Just for your info,  I installed a Propex 1600 (BTUs) heater in my last 
bus and the results were great.  This device is seriously warm and quiet 
and the guys at Propex are really helpful.  The 1600 comes with a 
control box with warning lights to tell your that the flame is on and 
the voltage (power) source is adequate.  The heater was quite happy at 
60mph also.

Unfortunately I'm still running 6v in the '57 so I can't install the 
Propex, which I pulled from the last bus before I sold it : )
