I run this same engine/distributor/carb combo in my '67 Westy. The first
step is to plug a solid rivet into the hole in the butterfly to get the idle
circuit to work. Followed the Hot VW's article in the March '93 issue for
the rest of the set-up on this specific combo. Get 25 to 27 mpg (imperial)
and engine temps/idle are perfect as well.
