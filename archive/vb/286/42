I went, bought a few things.  I had met Mark (the
seller) years ago when he was a student at the local
university and he noticed my double cab.
I would say there were 70 vehicles at the sale, mostly
parts cars.  Some went for $15 or so, some for
hundreds. There were a feew drivers, but I think he
kept all his good stuff. Lots and lots of boxes of
parts piled on a couple of farm wagons that were hard
to look at before the sale and impossible once things
started.  

I wasn't impressed with the auctioneer as he was hard
to distinguish in the crowd when he was selling on the
ground and his PA system made it very difficult for
many of us to understand him or even make out a few
words due to echoes and feedback. I thought that I was
high bidder on some things and it turned out that he
hadn't taken my bid--most auctioneers around here have
a couple of spotters (maybe called something else) who
are just there to watch for bidders, but he didn't
have anyone doing this. 

I know that there were things sold that I didn't see
until it was too late, and that is partly my fault for
not getting there even earlier and  looking through
boxes better, but it was arranged so that things were
hard to get at to look, with lots of notes on things
warning you not to move stuff out of boxes, etc.

I left before things were over, so I didn't see all of
the cars sell, but I don't need any more parts
cars/buses anyway.
