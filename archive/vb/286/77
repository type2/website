Subject: Re: [VB] Aircon applications for buses - heaters

Assuming that most people commute from home early in the morning when it's the coldest and need the most heat then, why not pre-heat the bus and give the stock setup a head start?
Find a bathroom type heater, ceramic or whatever, and an extension cord. Plug it in when you wake up and the bus will be ready when you get in to drive. If necessary get a timer rated for the load if it takes longer than your morning coffee time to heat up. The electricity used can't be much more than the gas cost to warm up the entire bus before you start moving. Unplug and go. 
Another idea is to use an electric vest and glove. Run on 12v. Find 'em at motorcycle supply places. Why heat the entire bus when only ]you[ are cold?
