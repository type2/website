Subject: RE: [VB] Solex 34 PICT-3 with 009 distributor

here's what i p-mailed to john. just my own personal
observations and experiences:
yeah, it's pretty common for hesistation with an
009 and dual port. there are some carb modifications
you can do, but it's more of a bandaid than a cure.
the *best* dizzy to get is an 043 905 205. it's
"stock" for a 74 non-california beetle, single vacuum
advance with mechanical advance as well. uses common
tune-up parts, the same ones as an 009. they are
pretty easy to find at swaps, and usually very cheap.
just make sure the mechanical advance is working the
same way youd check any other mechanical advance, and
maybe carry a piece of hose with you to suck the
vacuum unit to make sure it's working (although they
are still available as replacement parts, the are not
cheap).
you get a good mechanical advance curve with a smooth
vacuum as well. i've had one on mine for a long time,
and i would never even consider putting an 009 on.
i'll take a pic of it if you want to see what one
looks like.
