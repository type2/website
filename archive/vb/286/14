Well, I feel into a deal at a local farm where the guy was getting rid of his
sons pile of dub parts. Turns out that two of the 1500 were in the serial
number range of my truck and one of them was rebuildable. I'm using the last
set of 83mm on the shelf and will get this thing together this week, fire it
up on the test stand, and then stick it on the shelf for installing later if I
sell the truck. Surely some NOS freak will insist that it be as correct as
possible! Just one of those lucky parts finds!
