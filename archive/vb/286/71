Subject: 4 wheel disc brakes / master cylinder

So I have just finished the suspension set up for my Highroof, and I 
have a question. I'm running 4 wheels discs, late model Bus up front, 
aftermarket in the rear.

My question is what master cylinder?

My original thought was to go with a '67 dual circuit unit, but then, do 
I need to regulate the front to rear balance??
