In the past Jiffy Lubes have had it in a 55 gallon drum that you can go and
fill your own bucket with but I haven't done this in a couple of years so
try your local quick oil change place just don't let them put it in or do
any work on you air cooled car as they usually have young uns that don't
know what they are doing on these old cars
