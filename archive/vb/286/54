I agree with Scott. I've spent hundreds of hours over the years on carbs and
their idiosyncrasies. A lot of the major problems of the 34 PICT-3 have been
describe successfully in the many how-to's in the archives. Until the last few
years I was unaware of the blocking the butterfly hole trick and have since
incorporated it into all my rebuilds, including the 31 PICT with great
results. Starting out with a good carb and a good distributor is the only way
to get it right.

After watching this debate for a number of years also, each distributor/carb
combo has it's pros and cons. I am also thinking that the reason the
34PICT-3 combination and 009 distributor may be given a bad rap is that the
some of parts used may be well worn making the hesitiation and adjustment
issues worse and non-fixable. In my own case, it took a 3rd rebuilt 34
PICT-3 to work in conjunction with the 009 and get all the adjustments right
on the money. My carb is also not set "fat", and the hesitation is not
there.... spark plugs, temp, exhaust color and mileage all proper.

My definition of "fat" is a vintage two barrel Bug Spray on a 1600 cc DP
getting 13 mpg.... wonderful!!
