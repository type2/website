Is buying stuff from the UK expensive too? I thought you guys were pretty
tight.

Reason I ask was the recent thread that referenced Propex heaters ended-up
being a UK company.

Seems like that would be a lot less expensive than fabricating an entire
"climate control" system. I don't know about you but I can handle a little
heat in summer but can't handle the cold so well.

Dont forget you can buy things from the UK without our dreaded VAT (value 
added tax) which is 17.5%. Here in the UK you can still buy Brazilian bay window 
busses they come with Webasto heaters 
http://www.webasto.com/home/en/homepage.html any body had any experience with them? They come with timers and I was 
told you can fit a gismo so you can start them by your mobile phone! By the way 
with the old propex you could have the blower running in the summer to cool as 
well. Mike
