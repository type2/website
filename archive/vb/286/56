Subject: Gas pedal assy

Does anyone know where I can see a diagram of how the pedal assy goes
together? The PO had some kind of Rube Goldberg arrangement to get the pedal
to work. I bought the correct parts but I don't know how they fit together. I
have the hinge half that welds to the floor, the pedal and the leaf spring
that holds the pedal up. These are the parts I'm trying to install.
