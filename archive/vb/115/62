Hi Sean,
If you mean the pedal is loose on its shaft, then yes they can wear out!  
Part 211 721 153C Bush - Brake pedal lever from Chassis No. 20-117 902.  
Check section 7, illustration 37 in the 1958-67 parts manual on the Obsolete 
Air-Cooled Documentation Project on Vintagebus.com!   Eric&Barb
