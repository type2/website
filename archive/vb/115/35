I have this problem... the culprit seems to be the little curved piece on
the flaps - the bit that the flap rod attaches to.
if it gets bent, and is no longer the proper arc, the thermostat doesn't
adjust properly. i also think that once bent, it has lost some of its
strength, and seems to be near-impossible to -keep- at the proper arc.

also, i have found at least three different flap rod lengths, and at least
two 'geometries,' ie, the little wiggles that get the rod through the
heads. i assume that these are 36, 40, and up, but i have only built 1600s,
so am not sure.

next time the motor is out, i'm replacing the flaps and rod and trying again.
