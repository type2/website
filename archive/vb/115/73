Subject: help! I've been cursed, and I can't get any posts

Last week someone posted about not getting all the posts.
this got me to thinking ,hey it's been a little scarce lately.
and i am now down to 2to 5 posts a day....
I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS!
I've been holding on to AOL5.0 so i would'nt have problems like when 6.0 
first came out.
but i don't know if it's aol screwing around with me or recently did'nt the 
list change servers or something?????

THom if it''s on my end, i got on yahoo mail so that address is   
joejd1313(-at-)yahoo.com

if its on your end my normal address
any help , i would be grateful   A man can't live on 2 posts a day!
thanks joe
