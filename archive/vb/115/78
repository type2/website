Dan,
Another webmaster (who will remain nameless) and I were having an arguement
about how useless the lower tin was. I have never ever ran the lower engine
tin. 120 AZ temps, no overheating. I argued that it  just had to do with
the keeping an accurate temp for the thermostat (which i have never ran
either!=) and a guard for the puhsrod tubes.  I have heard its uses
referred to as a snow guard, a mud guard, a rock guard, channel just  to
transfer the heat to the back, or a place so the rats can nest once the VW
breaks down.
Check out this email i saved from a while back on the type2 list. I fully
agree.

Looking for opinions on the bottom tin...the pieces that attach to the case
and the heater boxes.  The local shop owners believe them to be gravel
guards to protect the push rod tubes from flying rocks.  Others think you
have to run EVERY piece of the tin in order for the complete system to
work.  I'm running the type 3 or "Cool tin" on the bottom of my cylinders.
I wanted the air exiting the bottom of the cylinders to blow across the oil
sump, theoretically cooling it (while stopped) so I made "shorty" bottom
tins.  basically cut them at the first case attachment screw tab.  Figured
that would be good enough to keep the gravel out.  Any other opinions on
this one?

-Dan
