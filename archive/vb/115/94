Subject: Re: [VB] 1/3-2/3 seat question

From what I've seen, the back is upholstered in the
same vinyl as the sides of the seat bottom and seat
back.

There is a piece of thin board under the upholstery on
the back of the seat as well. It's made of something
like plastic or tar board. This prevents narrow
objects from easily poking through the vinyl into the
cavity of the seat back, and (on microbuses - standard
and deluxe)it also serves as a foundation for the
ashtray mount.
