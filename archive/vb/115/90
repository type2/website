Subject: Carborator fresh air tube clip and more stuff

Anyone have an extra fresh air tube clip they are
willing to sell?  This is the clip that mounts the
paper fresh air tube as it goes from the air cleaner
across in front of the main pully thru the engine tin.
 

Anyone have one??

Also looking for:
2 large 65-67 style wiper arms
2 sets of green webbing seat belts
1 set factory bus tools.

Thanks
Matthew
