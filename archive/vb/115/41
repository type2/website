Yes, I believe you are correct.  If you may remember my search for a correct 
seat stand for my '62 I finally found one which dipped in the middle, but 
the upper mounting tabs point inwards on the one I settled for.  It must be 
the '59-'60 seat base that I have, as the DC body mounting areas want the 
tabs to be pointing outwards.

Willing to trade anyone for a '61-'65 base if the need the earlier one.

Alex
