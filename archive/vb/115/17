Subject: vallejo show sunday - anyone??

Anyone going to the Vallejo show this weekend at the Solano Fairgrounds?

I'm actually loading up stuff to swap. Hopefully make a little extra VW money 
before Bug-o-Rama hits later this month.

If anyone makes it, stop by. I'll be in my 15 window selling parts.
