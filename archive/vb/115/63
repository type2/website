Subject: Stove for Westfakia owners and heaer boxes

Hello List,

I know that is post is pushing it quite a bit but I
have the perfect stove unit for you Westfakia owners.
It is a Optimus~Princess unit. This is a "NEW" unit
made back in the late 70's. When I bought it, it still
had the tape on the burners that held them down when
it was in the box. Any way it is item #1826666617. It
is on the auction sight who name is pig latin for
BAY....I should be shot for posting a message like
this....This is the same stove that I listed for sale
on the list a few days ago. 

On to better bus content...
I haven't had the chance to work on the heater boxes
that I was restoring. I will work on them today. I
should have at least one ready to be POR 15'd. The
other one will not need as much welding(I hope). It
turns out that these weren't even made for a bus. I am
starting to like them because they are simple to
restore and if they go to pot, I can always take off
the covers and use them as exhaust manifolds. Any way.
Have a great day!

David Kelly
