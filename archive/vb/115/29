Subject: Re: [VB] Run the thermostat or not?

Decided to go ahead and put the thermostat in.  Figure it will probably help
and can't hurt.  Drilled and tapped the case and got all the parts.
Installed it all tonight.  Never could get the thermostat to where it would
go from flaps completely to completely open.  Adjusted it so the flaps are
partially open cold to wide open hot.  better that what I had before.  Are
there different style brackets and rods for different sized engines?
