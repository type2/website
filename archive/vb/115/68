system to work.  I'm running the type 3 or "Cool tin" on the bottom of my
cylinders.  I wanted the air exiting the bottom of the cylinders to blow
across the oil sump, theoretically cooling it (while stopped) so I made
"shorty" bottom tins.  basically cut them at the first case attachment
screw tab.  Figured that would be good enough to keep the gravel out.
Any other opinions on this one?

Why do you want to blow hot air across the sump?

the goal of the original tin is to get the hot air out of the back of the
bus as quickly as possible.  If you just blow it out the bottom of the
engine, it has more of a chance to recirculate.
