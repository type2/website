Subject: [VB] DC rear seats

Everett,

My 60 DC had a different rear base then the ones found
on the 61-65.  I belive that there are 4.  

1.  Binz
2.  59-60
3.  61-65
4.  66-67

The difference on my DC was the orientation of the two
upper rear mounts.  I do not remember which way they
were, but the were opposite to the 61-65 bases.  I
think mine were mounted so the wing nut was inside the
base while the later ones the wing nut was outside the
base.  I searched for over a year to find the right
one and ended up having to cut off my brackets and
reverse them to mount the seal correctly.

Just my 2 cents

Matthew
