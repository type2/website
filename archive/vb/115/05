The way i do the Por15 is i sand the surface to get most of rust and =
paint
out, then i clean very well with marine clean, two time if possible =
then i
apply por15,  metal ready help but, i used it at first but now i =
dont... if
the area is exposed you have to put a  primer over it because por15 is
sensible to UV

and im real happy with Por15, i wonder why i didnt sed it before!!

 From my experience  I think the marine clean is optional but the metal
ready is not. You also don't have to use the top coat over the por-15 =
but it
will discolor in the sun if you don't.  Just get  all of the paint and =
as
much of the rust off as you can, it can only bond as well as what its =
bonded
too. I didn't do a good job of this in my single cab and patches of the =
por
15 chiped off and rust started again about a year later. I striped the
places I treated on my 15 window down to bare metal before using por-15 =
and
it looked great 2 years later. I did use marine clean where I had used
chemical strippers to remove the paint.

no, the other one
