Looking for opinions on the bottom tin...the pieces that attach to the =
case and the heater boxes.  The local shop owners believe them to be =
gravel guards to protect the push rod tubes from flying rocks.  Others =
think you have to run EVERY piece of the tin in order for the complete =
system to work.  I'm running the type 3 or "Cool tin" on the bottom of =
my cylinders.  I wanted the air exiting the bottom of the cylinders to =
blow across the oil sump, theoretically cooling it (while stopped) so I =
made "shorty" bottom tins.  basically cut them at the first case =
attachment screw tab.  Figured that would be good enough to keep the =
gravel out.  Any other opinions on this one?
