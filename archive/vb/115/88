The amount of pop out windows doesn't make it a
deluxe. There was no way a bus came with 4 pop outs
down one side, the most you could get was 6 total, 3
on one side and 3 on the other. My kombi came with 6
pop outs, a deluxe could get 6 also, and the last
always being a stationary window. The way you tell a
deluxe is that they have windows all the way to the
back of the bus, and 63 and earliers have them in the
corners as well. Also deluxes are the only buses that
came with a chrome emblem and belt line trim. For a
brush up on bus model terminology, pick up any hot
vw's magazine when Dave Heard was writing Transporter
talk.
