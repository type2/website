Subject: RE: [VB] Run the thermostat or not?

I have a bracket with just a regular hole plus a portion at the bottom that
is bent over 90 degrees to aid in holding the bracket vertical.  There is
absolutely no adjustment to the bracket.  I can only adjust by
screwing/unscrewing the thermostat 1/2 turns on the rod.

I have never seen an unslotted bracket, did they make fixed hole brackets
ever? I am looking at 7 of them right now from various years and they all
have slotted block mount holes.
