Subject: Malcolm in the Middle

Just watched tonight's episode of Malcolm in the Middle and I had to rewind
to re-see what I thought I saw. The teacher was driving a Bay window bus
that had a split painted down the middle and a "V" painted down the front.
It also looked like there was some deluxe trim. Very odd...does anyone know
more about this bus?
