Subject: Re: [VB] Run the thermostat or not?

I have had this problem when I put a doghouse shroud on single port heads. I
could not find the right combination of rods to clear the hole/channel in the
head to match the hook/loop on the doghouse flaps. Neither the non-doghouse or
doghouse would work. I gave up and just ran the flaps with the spring attached
holding them open.
