Hi AL,
Yes you can use air pressure to hold the valve in place.  The shop manual 
shows how to do it and the special fixture/tool that does the job.  We would 
also make sure that the #3 piston was at TDC just to make sure the valve has 
no way to dissappear if somthing goes wrong while you are working.  As for 
the valve spring 40 HP and earlier are differant from 1300/1500/1600 valve 
spring.
