Hi Dan,
Likewise we had the same problem and we to finally figured out the curved arm 
on the right flaps had to be rebent back to factory.  Should be about the 
width of a popcicle stick between the curved arm and the flap it is mounted 
to.  The flaps with thermostat as they are in your engine are much better 
than nothing in there!
