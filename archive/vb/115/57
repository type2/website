So I found this October 1958 Science and Mechanics magazine (I assume =
this is the precursor of Popular Mechanics).  They road tested a 23 =
window deluxe - and in that report they mention this camper unit from =
Saxe and Co. (from California).  This is a unit that slide in behind the =
bulkhead and had a stove, fridge, storage etc..  I guess you just buy =
the unit and turn your bus into a camper.  My question is - what would =
that cabinet be made out of?  What thickness of plywood etc.. Anyone =
know of plans for that sort of thing.  This one from the Saxe Co. is =
quite cool.  It slide in on tracks that were, I assume, screwed to the =
floor, and when it was slide out it had really long legs that were =
telescopic. A thing like this would be perfect for someone like me who =
has a z-bed.=20
