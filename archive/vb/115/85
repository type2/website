Hello Everyone

	When I was driving my bus today I took it for an hour drive up
the coast and stopped to get gas half way on my journey. When I got to
my destination I talked to a couple of volks and after about 10 minutes
I hopped back in the bus and the starter would not engage. There wasn't
even a noise like you would have if you turned the key but no starter
motor behind it. It was just dead turn the key and the oil and charging
lights went dim. So I got a push start from a couple of VW volksI was
talking to (Thanks!) and drove it home. I got it home and checked the
connection on the starter and even taping on it lightly nothing (hmmm!).
Tried it again and still nothing.  So I left alone for an hour and I
told myself I was going to tare into it and replace it. 

	I decided to give it one more shot and to my avail it worked
started right up. I drove around a little bit and stopped and started
right up again. I can't figure it out was the driving it an hour cause
the starter to warm up and not turn over again? I am stumped I was
thinking on just taking it out and going to Kragen a local parts store
and swapping it out. 
	
	Any thoughts would be appreciated

Thanks Again
