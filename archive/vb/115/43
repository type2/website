Subject: Broken vlave spring #3 nearly new engine-R and R help

I'm broken down at home. After going through valves before turingin her
to test compression.
I see the front most #3 exhuast I believe has a broken valve spring.
Am I correct in removing the pivot rod assembly, sliding off hat
retainer, and replacing srping, retorqueing and regapping valves, or is
the fix more complex than that? I wonder if I need compressed air like a
chevy to keep valve in place? I can do that with my leak down tester,
just use lower pis so engine doesn't go flying.
Are all stock valve spring similair?
My heads are 311 ---179a .
Bummed,
AL
