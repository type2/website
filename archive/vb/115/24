Hi Coocoo,
First you need to figure out which white!  Up to 1963 deluxe kind of models 
of buses had an ivory colored knobs.  1964-66 had a silver gray color of 
knobs.  1967 had a one year black rubber knobs.  The silver gray and ivory 
are often mistaken as simply white, but when you have them side by side the 
differance is very obvious!
