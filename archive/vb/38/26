Subject: Re: [VB] GL4 oil needed!~ HELP!

Try asking for gear oil instead of transmission oil. I found Sta-Lube
in a separate section of the store shelves with a bunch of other
oddball fluids, not with the GL5 tranny juice and ATF fluid. I think
Harbor Freight may carry it too, I saw some Sta-Lube products in their
Sacramento CA store.
