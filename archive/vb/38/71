Sure.  It just won't be very bright.  If it's one of the general
illumination lamps you might get some light out of it, but I wouldn't
use it for one of the warning lamps as it would be hard to see.

The Wagner lamp catalog I have has a table and a graph showing what
happens to bulbs that are ran over or under their design voltage.
The table only goes to 70% of design voltage, which gets you 28% of
design brightness and 7200% of design life, and 130% of design
voltage, which gets you 250% brightness, 4% life.  (To get 200%
brightness you will get between 7 and 11% life - _Blade Runner_ was
off by a multiple of about 5 to 7).  The graph goes further and implies
that by the time you get to 50% of design voltage, you will have less
than 10% of design brightness.  However, the bulb will last up to 10,000
times its nominal life.  

>It obviously can't work the other way around, but how about this way?

It will work just fine the other way around (6 V bulb in 12 V system),
for sufficiently small values of "work".  I have accidentally put 12 V
tail light bulbs in a 24 V ex-military truck and they did work - they
were really, really, really bright for a little while.  :)
