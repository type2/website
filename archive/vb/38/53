Subject: Bustoberfest and VW pumkins

Don't miss out on one of the last VW campouts for the season here in the
midwest!!  This is a really fun campout with a group of great bus people.

The campout is sponsored by the Buskatiers, an internet based VW group with
members from coast to coast.  The "club" is not an old boys club as I bet
we have more women in our group by percentage than any other VW group!!
And at campouts, there are always a number of kids around too.

If you want to see some really cool pumkin carved busses, go to the campout
website at:

Hope to see some of you there!!!
