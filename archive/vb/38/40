Subject: MISSING Crew Cab. Reward.

Hi,

An ad in our local paper, The Daily Breeze in Torrance, CA., today for
a missing crew cab. A photo shows a very nice looking vehicle
curbside.  Someone spent a pretty penny to have the ad published in
the front section of the paper in a 2" square space.

Text as follows:

REWARD  for information leading to the recovery of theis vintage 1962
volkswagen transporter turquoise & white (white top), crew cab.
license # 6C71192.  Call 310-547-2154 anytime.

Now you know as much as I do.
Chris
