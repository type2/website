Subject: Mystery Dizzy

I took the dizzy to the parts cleaner and uncovered some more text. It
is Bosch Germany, on the underside obscured by grime. On the housing
is stamped 825. On the vacuum advance arm is stamped 579. Still no
help on the dizzy page, the cans all begin with 07. Whatever. I am
going to pretend it is a 74 bug dizzy and time it at 7.5 before, see
what it does. It can't be any more out of place in my bus than the
009.
Thanks for the microfiching, too bad we didn't catch anything.
