Hi John,
We have done both!  A 12 volt bulb in a 6 volt system will work, just dimmer. 
 So not a good idea for nightime driving and definitely not a good idea for 
tailights in any circumstances.  We have installed 12 volt battery in a 
completely six volt VW in a pinch and had no problem running it during the 
day, we just  made sure to start it quickly to prevent the idiot lights from 
burning the speedo idiot light lenses.  The generator light flickered while 
doing this, but did not damage any of the electrical system.   Eric&Barb
