That was a right hand drive barndoor steering box and peddal assembly.
I did sell it......$5 bucks.

Sold a TON of other stuff too!

Had the matching rear end/frame out of it too.....lever shocks still
attaches.
That sold for $40.00.
Also sold a mint singlecab roof for $40.00,
A 36 horse fan shroud for $2, some 36 horse cylinder tin for $6/pair,
2 NOS 1600 german beetle exhausts for $5 each.
2 25 horse crank tins for $5 each,
A 36 horse intake for $5,

Didn't buy anything....wanted a roof rack there but the thing was missing
the wingnuts for the clamps and still has a price tag of $700.00.
Maybe he meant pesos?

Dragged the 54 kombi out there.....HUGE amount of interest.....everyone
wanted it.....noone coughed up the cash.

Robert Davis' 59 westy was AMAZING.....
My favorite bus of the show was Joe Crocketts 64 westy flip hatch.
