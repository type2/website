Yeah, a great show in terms of quality busses. Some
GREAT campers. The Westies (and a sweet dormobile) get
lots of attention. People seem to spend more time with
them, looking at all the neat little stuff.

I've got to agree with Everett about the non-buying. I
think it had something to do with high prices. 800 for
an incomplete sunroof mechanism. $125 for a middle
seat end panel (seemed steep, until the next guy I saw
with one wanted $250. CRAP! I paid less than that for
my SEAT! Upholstered nonetheless)

And does anyone know what was up with that front end
that looked like it was sitting on the bottom of the
ocean for 40 years? The thing looked like it came off
the Titanic. In my opinion, salvagable only as an art
piece (Actually, I did hear someone comment that
Everett would buy it and put it in his front yard)

Some guy had a fake 23 window bus on a trailer he
wanted 4800. It was more of a shell, primered, crust
and Bondo evident everywhere. Then there was a
Barndoor panel parked on the street. What were they
asking, 8000? It looked like it was gone from the
rockers down.

I even got into the action. I was putting a something
in DARTHVW and a guy asked if it was for sale. Joking,
I said, "Sure, ten grand!" He nodded and replied "Not
bad."

I don't want to sound salty, I know that if I ever
wanted to sell my bus I'd want top dollar, who
wouldn't? But it's all relative I guess.

On the flip side, there were some deals, I got a very
straight pair of overriders for my 69 for $10 and a
near perfect splash pan for $10. I even got an OG sump
plate with drain nut for free. The guy said that I
could just have it. I gave him a buck for good karma.

All in all though, I am very thankful I live out here,
close to such a great organization and so many busses.
to get a show like that a couple times a year, Pomona
every other month, the classic, WCM and WW and other
vendors, etc. No complaints. plus, the weather lets me
get away with no sunroof skin :^)
