Subject: 3rd and 4th gear aren't there

I finally got my 65 project out of the driveway, and around the corner to a
large parking lot.  First and second gear have worked well going up and down
the driveway, and 3rd and 4th "felt like they were there",  but when I tried
to get into third, I went back into first. So I tried again going from 2nd
to fourth, but I just went back into second.  I leaned, twisted, coaxed,
etc, but as far as I can tell, I only have 1st and 2nd.  I'm still in the
beginning stages of diagnosing every system, and it's the tranny's turn now.
Any thoughts, or ideas?

Thanks
