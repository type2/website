Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Free Beam Come and get it!

Hello Richard

    I have had three people so far ask for it and I will give it to the
first person that responded to the email if they still want it. If they dont
want it I will email the next person and so on.



Sorry
Just a few days to go and my buses will have a new home.
