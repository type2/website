What are you talking about?  Off a Civic?  Maybe Corolla?

Do you want old school 911 14" polished Fuchs?

As far as I know there is only 15" polished rims in the wide-five flavor.
Like Empi, BRM, Eagle, and so forth.  For these check any VW rag.

You can get chromed steel wheels too that look semi stockish... Not sure if
they are 14" or 15", maybe both.  Then again you could just have your
current steel wheels acid dipped and chromed.

Please be more descriptive in your request so we can better answer your
question.

Also as a general rule, all caps is equivalent to yelling in an e-mail.
