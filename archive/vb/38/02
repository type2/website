Subject: clutch woes

On the way home from work Friday the clutch in the DC 
started acting weird, here are the symtoms:
- engages further up in the travel.
- when the pedal is fully released there is a strong 
vibration in it.
- cannot detect any clutch slip.
- no visible problems; cable is fine as are both its 
connections (to pedal arm and clutch arm), clutch arm 
and clutch arm return spring also look fine.

So here are my questions:
Are these symptoms consistent with the TO bearing? I'm 
thinking one of the retainer clips let go.

Is it safe to drive to my bro's garage so I'm not 
pulling the motor in my apartment parking stall? I think 
no, if it completely whent it could buggar up a lot 
more... :(

TIA
