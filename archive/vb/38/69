Subject: i want a bus :-(

ok here it the deal, i have allways been a VW guy as i figure most of u are 
too and i want to get a VW bus at this point i drive a 1986 scirocco 8v with 
a perfect body and a near perfect engine and a 1993 jeep chereokee country 
edition dark blue exterior and beige interior perfect not a dent on her. i 
figure my best option would be to trade for a bus, trade the scirocco for a 
project that me and my friends will be able to do(i can do interior and 
electrical work, my moms b/f has worked on an aircooled engines for a while 
and has some experience with body work) or trade the jeep for one that is 
ready to be a daily driver or close to it. i don't want a perfectly restored 
vehical or anything close to it, i want a bus that runs well that i can use 
to drive people to ultimate frisbee games with my college team and drive 
home sometimes. i am located currently at my college outside of philly but 
home is point pleasant beach, NJ anyone in those areas willing to work 
something out i would greatly appreciate it. anyother info would also be 
appreciated, like if u feel that i should sell the jeep on my own and then 
go bus shopping. thanks, DJ

i only bought the jeep in augest and spent 4 grand on it then and it has had 
the whole front suspension rebuilt and pretty much every dent has been fixed 
to give u a frame of refrence if u don't know what a jeep cherekee is worth.
