Hi, I went to the OCTO Bus show this weekend, photos on my site:

The show was pretty cool.  I spent $10 on a couple heater boxes for my un=
-Bus.

At least 150 Buses were there.  Seemed to be a decent amount of selling
but maybe not a lot of buying?  A bunch of mid 60s middle seats were ther=
e
but only 1 back seat and a cople front seats.  A lot of front ribbed bump=
ers,
none of which seemed to change hands.

I saw someone driving around in a restored Barndoor(?) Deluxe around 6 am=

near Huntington Beach but they didn't seem to appear at the show, strange=
.
