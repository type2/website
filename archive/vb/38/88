Subject: Re: [VB] Members in Atlanta area coming out west?

Without knowing all the details of your situation, I would like to suggest that he ship it through
Greyhound, or similar.  Greyhound is cheap and has delivered everything that I've sent/received
through them safely.

Why would he accept your purchase if he doesn't plan on shipping it?  Again, I don't know all of
the details, here, but if it was purchased through Ebay or similar there are ways to get your
cooler to you.

best of luck,
T
