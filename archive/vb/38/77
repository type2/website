I think you ought to sell the chjeep for all it's worth, spend half
the proceeds on the most rust-free and complete bus you can find,
spend the other half the money and a lot of your (free!) time bringing
said bus up to sound mechanical shape. Then explain to the frisbee
team that they have to sit on milk crates because you can't afford the
damn middle seat and if you did have the cash you really ought to
spend it on a new steering box instead...
But that's only my opinion,

ok here it the deal, i have allways been a VW guy as i figure most of
u are
too and i want to get a VW bus at this point i drive a 1986 scirocco
8v with
a perfect body and a near perfect engine and a 1993 jeep chereokee
country
edition dark blue exterior and beige interior perfect not a dent on
her. i
figure my best option would be to trade for a bus, trade the scirocco
for a
project that me and my friends will be able to do(i can do interior
and
electrical work, my moms b/f has worked on an aircooled engines for a
while
and has some experience with body work) or trade the jeep for one that
is
ready to be a daily driver or close to it. i don't want a perfectly
restored
vehical or anything close to it, i want a bus that runs well that i
can use
to drive people to ultimate frisbee games with my college team and
drive
home sometimes. i am located currently at my college outside of philly
but
home is point pleasant beach, NJ anyone in those areas willing to work
something out i would greatly appreciate it. anyother info would also
be
appreciated, like if u feel that i should sell the jeep on my own and
then
go bus shopping. thanks, DJ

i only bought the jeep in augest and spent 4 grand on it then and it
has had
the whole front suspension rebuilt and pretty much every dent has been
fixed
to give u a frame of refrence if u don't know what a jeep cherekee is
worth.
