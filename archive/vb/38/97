"Einspritz" is fuel injection and "vergaser" is carburetor, if that
helps any.  As far as the engine codes, Muir has AF, AS, and AJ
from '75 on in Beetles.  Wilson has AJ as a stock engine, AS as a 
service replacement case, and doesn't mention AF at all.

Doliwa has a chart showing Bus engine availablity by year and another
one with engine codes.  Apparently in Europe you could get a 1600 in
a Bus right through to 1980!  The engine code list shows 1600s with
B, AB, AD, AE, AF, AS, and C codes.  The only clues I can gain from
the text are that in '71, AD and AB were carb motors, and in '75,
AS motors had carbs.  This book only covers Buses, though.
