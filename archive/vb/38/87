HI Eren,
Yes that is what the stocker KG used!  Though with the stock type 1 third 
gear and R&P there is a 5 MPH gap from the top of third (-at-)3,000 RPM to the 
bottom of fourth (-at-)1,500 RPM.

<< 2) I want that 0.82 in my bug , I will have a set from local junkyard but 
 how can I determine that it is a 0.82 ? the 0.93 bug 4th I guess has smt. 
 like 52/56 teeth , the 0.89 bug 4th again guess 23/26 teeth , but how about 
 type 2 0.82 gear set .. how many teeth ? >>

Check with your local tranny rebuilder for that specific info.

<<  3) for my sinle-cab , is that 0.77 an expensive item ? where can it be 
found 
 ? , 4.375 with 0.77 will be nice for me , 4.125 with 0.82 will result the 
same highway which will be less expensive but I am not sure IF my single-cab 
can climb with 4.125 loaded ??    >>

Are you sure you want the .77 fourth?  You will definitely need to change the 
lower gears to prevent an even more bigger MPH/RPM gap between third and 
fourth.  We use a 3.875 R&P with .82 fourth in our buses with a stock VW but 
differant from bus third gear to get only a 1 MPH gap between 3,000 RPM (-at-) 44 
MPH in third and 2,000 RPM (-at-) 45 MPH in fourth gear.  Below 2,000 RPM in 
fourth seems to lug the engine. Cruising with same size tires on front and 
rear axles results in 58 MPH (-at-) 3,000 RPM.  In our SC truck we can carry a 
load with a big bore 40HP engine on the freeway.  Gojng N. to S. in our W. 
Washington State area only one looong steeep hill in S. Puyallup and one 
through Tacoma makes us down shift into the top of third.    Eric&Barb
