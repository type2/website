Subject:  RE: [VB] Australian Rear Turn Lense?

They were only on Australian and Italian
buses from 60-62.  I have one set, far from
perfect which I have put in my 59 US samba to meet
local roadworthy requirements (US combined brake/turn
is not legal here - european bus still would have had
semaphores in 59....)

They are very very very hard to find
here and very very very pricey.  I could probably find
a set but you'd freak at what
you'd have to pay (I actually refuse to pay it myself
and will live with what I have...) 

They do fit a standard SBL17 single filament housing.

Does anyone have a set of the amber ?'59ish? round rear turn signal lenses? 
They are the same as the red '59ish tailight lenses, but amber in color. I 
wonder if anyone has reproed them...

I know there is an Australian on the list....if you've got a set, lets 
talk. Anyone else have any input?
