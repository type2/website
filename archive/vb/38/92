Hi Bob,
Sounds like a king or link pin wornout due to not being greased through the 
zerk fittings at least every 3,000 miles or perhaps a link pin needs 
adjusting.

what a wheel bearing sounds like when it goes? what happens when they go? do 
they implode on themselves? >>

Wheel bearing worn out sound like loose marbles.  If they go you could have 
the spindle shear off and watch that assembly roll out in front of you!
