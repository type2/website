Subject: RE: [VB] Unlowering a '61

  My 1960 DD, 3.88 ring pinion, 1.22 3rd (or close), .77 4th gear,large nut
RGB, stock height, stock front brakes with the later larger brakes in the
rear, cruising speed 75 mph, rpm's 3400, 80 mph rpms 3800, have had it to 90
or close, but the speedo needle was on the peg at 0. Don't believe me, ask
anybody who's cruised with me, well only one has kept up with me (really
they backed off) and they were also in a splitty (far from stock). Engine is
a stroker 1800, 74X88 cut ins,6.8 to1 compression, big valve duel port heads
and duel Kadrons. At 75 cruising I get approx. 18 mpg, at 65 mph I get 13
mpg. I use the cheapest gas I can get, use a type 3 tight finned oil cooler
and can generally check the oil after a good cruise without burning my
fingers. I feel all I have done is bring the drive train up to a spec VW
would have done today. One day I'll do the disc brake thing, but haven't had
to time to finish the prototype hub (front) assembly yet, but soon as
necessity calls for more stopping power, even though my brakes have 40,000
miles on them and are still over 50% there.
  Stock trannys are slow (at least OG 1960's), I thought my 60 15 window was
slow with the original 40hp, but came to the conclusion that it's the trans
gearing. I put my back-up 1776 single port in it and didn't really gain any
speed, but accelerated like a bat out of he##, could cruise at 55 mph but I
felt that was the limit of the TRANS, I could squeeze a few more r's out of
the engine easily, but the trans was saying NO PLEASE. So out it comes and
in goes the 3.88/82 4th trans, retaining the small nut rgb's. This should
give me a comfortable 65 mph cruise and the 15 window will always travel in
groups more then likely, pulling it's matching Allstate trailer.

Ronnie, build to cruise,

HUH?

With a stock 1500 and the original transmission in my '66, 60 was easily
possible...65-70 was available if i needed it.  Normal milage was still
higher then normal in my '69 with 1600.

If you actually run the numbers, the gearing of the stock box in the '66
vs the stock box in the '69 are IDENTICAL.

A minor ring and pinion change (to a 4.12) and the gearing is now a tad
higher...I've slid up to 80, and still had throttle.  I dont cruise at
this speed in the '66 (i sure did in the '69 though..:), but it is
certianly available.

No effect on daily driving, and yet will have "less chance" of flipping
over??  I've driven both the '69 and the '66 to the edge of adhesion and
beyond (on /good/ tires (yokohama 370 LTs, as well as BS RD 6whatevers)
and bad ones) and never flipped.  Now, of course, had i hit a hole, or a
curb, or something had obstructed my slide/turn, certianly i probably
would have rolled.  But that would hold just as true for a lowered bus)


I'm still trying to figure out if you are advising for or against the IRS
conversion, lol.

Personally, I'd say do whatever you want.  My advise would be to keep it
stock, and drive it like a bus....if you drive it like a porsche, expect
the handling, acceleration, and braking to be less then adequate, no
matter what you do.

And if you really think that 60-70mph in a stock bus isnt fast enough,
expect to put much more work into the brakes then you ever put into the
suspension or drivetrain.  For all of our sakes.
