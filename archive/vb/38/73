The Bosch number above does appear on 
http://www.type2.com/library/electrip/boignp.htm .  It says it's
for 1200 engines (!) produced in Mexico (?) from January 1978 on (!).
It also lists it for a "1303" which I *think* is a Super Beetle from
8/75 to 12/79.  Given the dates for this second application, it was
probably a 1600; unsure if it was fuel injection or not.
