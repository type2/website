I recently purchased a single NOS one for $100.  I don't think anyone has
repoped the brackets but the pads from my understanding have been made by
several.... something about a difference in the 'P'... who knows.  There is
a guy reproducing the flat bar brackets in Canada I think.

I have a picture of it on the following url:

It is also shown in the 63 empi catalog.
