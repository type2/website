Try http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ovhignbo.htm - it lists an 043 905 205J
for a '75 Beetle Auto-stick, fuel-injection.  The original application
for your distributor is probably closer to that.  Is there a Bosch number
(like 0 231 xxx yyy) on it?

With most parts, as the letters at the end go up, the part gets better.
With a distributor, though, it usually means an advance curve change -
not necessarily "better", just "different".

Good luck!
