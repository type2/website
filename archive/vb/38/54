Subject: Re: [VB] Crowsfoot wheels

i can't help with the two-date stuff (my one crow's foot has a tire on it) other than to suggest that perhaps the wheels were made in two parts and each part was dated.  that's just a guess based on nothing.

i also can't help you much about when crow's foot rims were made but i heard here on this list that they were made for more than two years.  i'd check the one i have but i know that i've not been able to find a date on it in the past.  roger of '67 buses fame has a couple of crow's foot rims and if i remember correctly they do not have tires on them.  convincing him that he did not need 15" rims for '67 buses was met with total resistance so i did not even get to examine them for a date.  (i guess i was lucky to keep my hand!  haha!)

i checked dropgate.com in hopes of finding information there but didn't find anything in the m-code or the year-to-year section.  with just 30 minutes for lunch that was about all i could do plus typing this reply.  gotta go be a librarian again.
