I guess you need to come to some So Cal shows, Pomona or something besides
up North. I usally see 1 or 2 EMPI oil pump/filter???, Empi bug rear seats
and assorted other EMPI goodies, but RARELY the steps! I guess I'll buy all
the EMPI sh#t down here and bring it up north to trade for steps.


ronnie

but then again anything with vintage EMPI and even some of the newer old
crap brings big money out here. Wait till EMPI brings back there Vintage
Packaged and Taiwan repoed parts of original EMPI stuff, pull off the made
in Taiwan sticker and you'll have NOS EMPI parts  <:!)

Hi Ronnie and Jon,
Nope!  Just because we think it is the most commonly found original EMPI
part 
at the swaps does not mean we think it is the most commonly found VW part in

the world.  For one thing with the EMPI logo on it big and bold on it, it is

easy for even the novice VW owner to notice it.  Try finding say one of the 
original EMPI oil filter/pumps with EMPI logo on it (Wish we had a dozen
more 
of those!) or the oil filter with the EMPI sticker on it or the 1964-65ish 
front bus anti-sway bar (We had one NOS unit.) or a type 3 EMPI seat or the 
EMPI bug gauge set.  All of these are much harder to find than the EMPI 
steps.     Eric&Barb
