Subject: Re: Free Beam Come and get it!

    If anyone is interested I have a front disk brake front end. I got it
for some trade work but I am moving and don't want to store it in my new
house. I live on the Central Coast (California) and will be moving this
week. I will be able to retrieve it from the location that I am at for about
two weeks so please let me know. Sorry I wont ship it you pick it up!

PS: Everything is on the beam except the master cylinder. This came with a
23 window that a previous owner was going to install.
