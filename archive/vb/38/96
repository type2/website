Hi Jason,
Take a good look where Germany is on the map!  The weather during the winter 
comes from the artic and/or out of Russia.  The VW bug was built and priced 
as a low priced auto which meant many of them did not get to sit in a nice 
warm garage.  With a hand crank 100% of what would be left of the voltage 
from a battery chilled well below 0 F could spark the plugs well enough to 
get the engine running.

was pissed after a series of failed attempts to crank his engine.)  >>

Yes, and often could have been injured or killed since back then one hand 
adjusted the spark on the steering column and if the spark was not readjusted 
from high RPM to idle the crank handle would often kick back with all the 
force of the piston!
 
<< Also, alternators were first used in 1960.  Why did VW not use them until 
almost 10 years later? >>

Just a guess, but when things first come out on the market they are expensive 
often due to patent/s on the item which means $$ has to be paid to the patent 
holder.  Also VW more often than not would wait before just adding something 
until it had been road proven.  Much like many of the early electronic anti 
lock braking systems had a big problem of locking up the brakes due to 
interferance from strong radio signals.  Oddly from what we hear the early VW 
type 3 FI had many problems including from high powered CB radio 
interferance!  Only when the late 70s bus with type 4 engine a the "new" FI 
system was FI simplified and very reliable.
