Heck, I've even seen 'usable' 7's and 9's for $800!

The #1 thing I caution people about with Fuchs wheels is tomake
sure they're getting *REAL* Fuchs and not cast replicas.  There
are more replicas running around in the VW community than real ones.
If the back have a 'grainy' appearance, they're fake.

The other thing that makes me giggle is when people advertise 15x6
as 'deep dish' wheels.  Until you've seen the 9" and 11" RSR Fuchs,
you haven't seen 'deep'!
