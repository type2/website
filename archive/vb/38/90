Subject: westy curtain questions

Hi,
   I am ready to have some curtains sewn for my '67 but have a few questions 
maybe some of you can help me with.

1) Did '67 westys have 2 curtain rods on each window or a rod on top and a 
spring on the bottom?  I have rods for the top of each window and didn't 
know if I should bother to find more.

2) Where should the top rod be mounted on each window relative to the metal 
frame that surrounds the window from the inside?  I checked out all the 
westy pictures I could find and there seems to be a little bit of variance.

3) What are the dimensions of each curtain half? Some of the ones pictured 
seemed pretty long.

My bus is not exactly what you would call "stock" but I guess I might as 
well get it close whenever possible.

thanks for your help,
Wayne Carlisle
'67 camper
