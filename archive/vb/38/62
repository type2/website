Time for some debate I reckon...List has been kinda dull 8-)

Donald,
       First off, I am gonna assume your bus is lowered the correct way, any 
combo up front as long as it involves dropped spindles, and a kit from 
someone like WolfGang, or Creative Engineering in the rear.....  With that 
said, Unless you plan on putting your bus back to true stock form, ie: king 
and linkpin front end, and correct year gear reduction boxes, I wouldn't 
waste your hard earned money and time with putting a late model front end 
under your bus, or an IRS setup in the rear. If you are concerned about the 
value of your bus, the late model stuff hurts it as much as lowered stuff, to 
a TRUE Vintage person.  They are gonna have to go through just as much work 
to get it back to original.  And with gear reduction boxes, your milage and 
highway cruising speeds really suck unless you spend the REALLY big bucks for 
a true, freeway flyer 4th gear and super expensive custom ring and 
pinion(higher than IRS RandP).  And with the lowered stance, your bus will 
look much better, and have less chance of flipping over in high speed 
turns!!!!  Unless your bus is really slammed, the lowered stance will have no 
effect on daily driving, if you keep on the paved roads.

I would use your hard earned money to fix rust, or paint, or buy other stuff, 
to keep it on the road that much longer!  or maybe some safari's or such... 
Stuff that make the type II experience that much better!!

Good luck
