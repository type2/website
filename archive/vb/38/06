Subject: Australian Rear Turn Lense?

Does anyone have a set of the amber ?'59ish? round rear turn signal lenses? 
They are the same as the red '59ish tailight lenses, but amber in color. I 
wonder if anyone has reproed them...

I know there is an Australian on the list....if you've got a set, lets 
talk. Anyone else have any input?
