Absolutely true. Nicest bus amongst the many nice buses there. I passed on
his offer to race for pink slips, though. I think he was a little giddy from
finally getting it out to a show.....

Good to see all the Cali folks again. It had been a week since Pomona, I was
starting to miss them. Little over 2800 miles on the clock so far for the
month. Another 1000 to go over the next couple of weekends and the
Westfailure gets parked till Buses by the Bridge. Good thing too. Starting
to show the wear. Got rock holes in both headlight lenses (they don't chip
at 85, they penetrate), got bug entrails from three states all over the PLF
bra, the turn signals stopped cancelling a few hundred miles back and the
high beam relay let all the smoke out. Beat one 8-ply steer tire to death
and am working on the other, grenaded 2 rear shocks so far and burnt up an
electric fan. The speedo howls at 90, there is a shimmy at 80 (85 is the
place to be) the tranny is starting to leak, the Ford u-joint is getting
ready to let go again and my ass is permanently shaped like a 914 seat. I've
been picking up more parts than I'm using so far. I've used a little over
200 gallons of fuel, 3 quarts of ATF, 8 bottles of Tequila, and four cases
of SOL. It's running better now than when I started, kinda fix it while you
drive. We'll see how it goes. Freak bus or not, it gets driven.
