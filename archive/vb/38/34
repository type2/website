Subject: 64 Bus for trade

Hey folks,
I am looking to trade a '64 bus with a running 40 HP engine for a bug, bay window bus, ghia or other?? I got this bus as part of a trade for another car, and I already have my '66 so I don't really need another split window.  This bus does have some rust issues, there are holes in the front floor and the passenger rocker (i have the new rocker panel yet to be installed) But all in all it's not too terrible. I would describe this bus as a "project" because it does need some work, but I also want a "project" in trade so it all works out! There are some pix on Everett's site http://www.thesamba.com/vw  along with a more detailed description.  At the site search the classifieds using the text jbakerccymca as a search criteria.



Peace, John Baker
