If you do the 68 rear set up, you need an IRS conversion, which is basically
even more difficult and complicated than the rig you have now. Bus Boys
sells these kits, and are adjustable for ride height from stockish to 4.5
inches drop.
I would go with the redux boxes, which is what I did to go back to stock
form the same rig you have now. Get uncut spring plates, a trans (Ronnie can
hook you up really nicely with a Rancho outright) and bolt her right in.

I've posted a few previous queations regarding this and have appreciated
everyone's help.  Upon the advice of many I have located a '68 front end in
real good shape, everything there except the brakes, so I'm going to go that
route and eliminate the king and link pins.  The rear is complicated and I
have had it checked out at a local reputable shop.  The tranny is a swing
axle Type I, the spring plates have been modified as well.  To get back to
regulation height I have been advised to go back to the reduction gear boxes
and a freeway flyer tranny, to give me some decent speed.

Here's my question:  Since I'm going full 1968 up front, could I install a
regular '68 rear suspension and transmission that would get me back to
normal height and thus avoid the reduction gear boxes?  Would that work on a
1961 panelvan?  Thanks again for all your help.  Don.
