It's funny about the non-buying aspect.

My son and I found a set of 2 tone door panels for his '63 ragtop bug.  The owner was
so busy talking to his friends, that we had to stand there for a few minutes, until one
of his other friends interupted them so we could ask how much he wanted for them.  His
price seemed a little high, so we said we would "Walk around" on it for awhile.  When
we came back to make an offer, the owner was gone, his friend was there, but could not
take anything less than the owner quoted us the first time.  We said we'd be back.
Walked around for another 45 minutes, (lets face it, going back to look at Joseph
Crokett's Westy is a worthwhile walk), went back to see the guy-still not there.
Walked around for another 1/2 hour, went back-guy STILL not there.  I noticed that he
hadn't sold much of anything since we walked by the first time.  So we gave up.  The
ironic thing is-I bet he is a guy that always complains because he can't seem to sell
anything.  I know it's not the mall, or a retail store or anything, but some vendors
just don't get it.  Go figure.
