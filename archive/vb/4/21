Subject: Re: [VB] middle seat question / trade / parts needed to repop

On these middle seat questions

    On the bus I just picked up it is a walk thru and it only has the welded
in plates for a full length seat. It is a 65 21 window with a rubber floor
mat for a 2/3 seat?  I am not sure what to think about this it doesn't look
to me that the floor was replaced and the Mcodes say it is a walk thru so
what gives.  Any suggestions!

I would like to thank everyone that replyed to my steering box questions and
when I got all the crud off the box I found a VW stamp on it with 211 xxx
xxx xxx so it was Vintage. Anyway's thanks for the help.

>A few month back I picked up a full length middle seat for my bus, but
since then have come to learn that a walk through should of had a 3/4 seat,
is this really true? my bus has the extra key ways in the floor for a full
length seat but they are screwed in brackets not welded on ones.

Yes, most walk-thrus had a 2/3 middle seat but you can just check the floor
mounts to see what is proper or check the holes in your original cargo floor
rubber mat, if you still have it.  Real floor mounts are welded-in, as you
indicated.

The 62-63 2/3 middle seat is fairly difficult to find, although you could
always fake it by using a 64-65 seat and switching the grab handles.

I also have a full-length 62-63 seat that I would trade for a short one...

'67 seats have the kicked-out leg near the cargo doors.  '66 had this too?
 I'm not sure on that.
