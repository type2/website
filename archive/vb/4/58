 it does suck.  it is what happens when the bus had safaris.   So I took  two 
pieces of metal, drilled suitable holes, and bolted through the floor holding 
the gas pedal hinge in place.   one piece above the floor, one below.  took 
some manueveriung, as there are some bits under the floor right there.  But  
no big deal to install that.  

ANyway, I did that to the 65 westy a year and a half ago,  and  until about 6 
months ago, it was my daily driver (when I was driving the 61).  SO it seems 
pretty functional.  But as the 61 is full of rust holes and drafty,  I am 
going to go buy tags for the 65 so I can drive it this winter.  Hm I don't 
need a truck,  it would be another VW to do maintenance on.   it would just 
be nice to borrow one now and then.
