Subject: Re: [VB] Need sheet metal for '65

I tried to get some info on lead as a filler at my local welding 
shop. They no longer stock it but said that most people are using a J 
& B Weld type of epoxy to fill in the pits. I am giving it a try as 
well. I would suspect that it will have good long term results as I 
have used it on many other projects. (...)
