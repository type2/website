Subject: RE: [VB] middle seat question / trade / parts needed to repop

I am not sure on the years or if mine came out of a Kombi or a standard, but
mine is the one with the plastic end pieces. I would really like to trade
for a correct middle (2/3) seat. I have cash in addition to the full length
one.

In regards to the second part of my question. Is their anyone out there
wanting to loan me the chrome ends to make a repop set? I know their has to
be a parts dealer that would like to offer these. Heck one could make a grab
handle to adapt to a bay seat.
Shawn

hm- interesting- I thought 62-66 was the same-   now 66 is different one
year
only as well as 67 (67s have the arm rest going the other way on the 2/3
seats than the earlier ones)

how is 62/63 diff from 64/65?
