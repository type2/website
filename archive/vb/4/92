Subject: Middle seat

Hello,
 I'm new here, so please forgive me if my questions
sound a little silly. I have a 1960 Kombi that is
about 60% done, a friend of mine brought me a middle
seat last week that obviously was not for this year
and model, it appears to be a 2/3 seat with the arm
rest(grab handle?) on the passenger side where my
cargo doors are. The brackets on the belly pan don't
even come close to matching up,can anyone tell me what
year and model this might fit. I'd like to sell it,
but I need some info so I don't mislead anyone. Any
and all info would be greatly appreciated.
