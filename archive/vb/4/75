Subject: RE: [VB] Lead Sled

The lead used for cars is different then wheel weight and/or fishing
weights, there are additives in it and it is a lot purer then auto grade
lead. There are a couple coach builders (2 of the best in the world, yes
here in Havasu). They build Cobra bodies and I have seen them build a couple
of 550 Porsche Spyder bodies. I have seen them take old lead and remelt it
and put the additives in it. I have learned a lot from them on leading and
was getting pretty good at it before I quite doing heavy metal resto's. A
while back Matt here in town had a DC they worked on and instead of
replacing the drivers door bottom 6 inchs and the dogleg they FABBED
complete new pieces, tiged them in, metal finished and smoothed with a
little lead absolutely beautiful.


Ronnie   want to relearn a lost art

ps. when they buy lead sticks they are very picky as to who they get it from
as there are differences in qualities.

Hey  while you guys are talking about finding lead and
or JB Weld to fill in the small rust holes.What is the
diff from the lead from old wheel weights down at the
tire store and lead for your bus?
