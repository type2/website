Subject: Re: [VB] front tranny mount

well, i went and checked the mount again and tried pulling back on the
fanhousing like you said, but the engine/tranny didnt tip up at all.  i
tried tightening the bolts for the front mount, but they were already pretty
tight.  it usually only clunks when im shifting into a higher gear, not
really when im down shifting.  if im really cautious when shifting i can
make it so there is no clunk.  is there anything else it could be besides
the mounts?  the shift stick doesnt jump around and im not sure what you
mean by "lurch".  thanks for all the replies ive received so far!
