Ok all,

I'm trying to locate 24 6x15 mm bolts, (Kamax preferred) to bolt the wheel
cylinders to the backing plates of my 356B brakes that are going on the 59
dc... (or if any of you are verse in Porsche,  what *would* be the correct
fastener???).  I have determined that the 6x15 hex bolt with a lock washer
would do perfectly.

So, where on any era/type of VW could I scavenge such a fastener?

Anybody have any they could spare?

TIA


David
