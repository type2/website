I had the floor and pedal on my '72 westy fall off once.  I had to reach
down and grab the pedal with one hand and operate it that way to get me
home.  It put another dimension to shifting.  I puttied in some license
plates and attached a door hinge to the pedal which had no hinge left.  I
drove it for another 4 years that way until I sold it.
