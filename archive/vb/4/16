  You can also pull the input shaft out of an old trans and use it. I hace a
few of those around that I use. It's nice because when I missplace one I
always have a few more lying around or I can always pull one out of a junk
trans.

Next time you go to your local VW shop, look around for his junkpile of the 
alighnment tools. My guy here has 'em all hanging on the wall like a 
collection used beer bottles or something. Just ask 'em if you can have one 
or two of them.

I suggested the local guy here get his shop's name stamped on them and 
start giving them away to his old VW guys. Better than a damn keychain!
