Subject: stripped threads

Greetings knowledgable bus drivers, 
  On the two hinges that hold the engine lid on there are two screws on
each going up into a captive plate in the body of the bus. After having
much trouble removing these and no luck with various screw extractors I
decided to drill a little bigger and use a 6mm tap. This worked well on 3
of them, but one became stripped. ( the tap slides in or out of the hole
)  So, my next step I guess should be tap it out with a bigger tap? ( or
a threaded insert ? )  Looking in the Craftsman catalog they list a 6.3mm
tap, would this be big enough or should I move up to 7.00mm. If I use
6.3mm will I have trouble finding that size screw? TIA for your advice,
Chris
