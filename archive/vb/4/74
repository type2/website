Subject: Re: [VB] Straight Axle Kit Question (Vintage Nazi's need not respond)

Axle tubes are long axle tubes, with short axle end castings
Axles are long axle long spline
Spring plates are Bus cut to accept the Bus end casting (some measuring, not welding is required
here)
Brakes can be just about anything, from stock Bus to disc depending on what type of offset you are
planning on running. Most typical setup is 4 lug Type III or Bug with 4 to 5 adapters used to push
the whell / tire combo away from the spring plate.
