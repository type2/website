Subject: Straight Axle Kit Question (Vintage Nazi's need not respond)

 I am interested in putting a straight axle kit.

 What I need to know is, does anyone really know how to actually MAKE the
 straight axle kit?
 What spring plates are used, what axle tubes are used, and what axle ends
 are used, and how is it all put together in the end? I am just curious,
 because it really looks like a '68 bug rear end, but I figure it couldn't
be
 just that easy.

 Any information would be greatly appreciated.

 Thanks
 Charles
