Subject: MIDDLE SEAT

Hi Dan!
Full width middle seats were factory installed in some walk-throughs in '66
and '67.  I don't know of an "M-Code" for this, but it was done.  I also
don't know if this was ever done on earlier buses...I've never seen one.
And, yes, late '66-'67 full-width AND 2/3 seats were different from earlier
ones.  The full-width seat had the outer (right side) leg canted outward and
the fold down part of the seat back was twisted inward slightly to allow
easier access to the rear seat.  The 2/3 seat had NO outer leg and NO
infamous clip-on "kick panel".  The first legs (from right to left) were
offset several inches inward to the left under the seat...don't know why.
This 2/3 seat is very rarely seen.  And , as already mentioned, at some
point (late '67?) the lower frames on these seats were factory drilled with
holes for the new type hold down clamps that supposedly kept the seats from
slipping in a crash.  Also, NONE of these later seats had chrome ends or
metal grab handles as alluded  to in an earlier post.  They were all
equipped with vinyl grab bars and bio-degradable plastic end caps that I
wish someone would reproduce!!
