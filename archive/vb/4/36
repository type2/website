Subject: [VB] Off to Maryland!

Well, the road trip I've eagerly awaited all summer long has finally arrived,
and tommorrow after work I hit the pavement for Baltimore.  I'm picking up a
friend in Kentucky, and after that it's off the beaten path avoiding the
interstates the entire way.  And I'm taking my '67 Westy.

The bus is as ready as it's going to get.  The air I put in the tires a couple
months ago is all still there.  I adjusted the valves on my lunch break today.
I adjusted the idle after the engine was good and hot from the drive home.  
Filled up the still somewhat leaky tranny.  Loaded up a bunch of spares,
including two SVDA dizzies, two fuel pumps, a carb, generator, voltage regs,
and the like.

As I was cleaning it out, I had another chance (ugh) to peel back the floormat
up front and peer at the nothingness beneath.  It seemed to me that my most 
likey problem would be the floor that the gas pedal is attached to would
fall off.  I'll have to be careful!  Speaking of front floors, what's the word
on the whole floor repro?  I forget who brought that up -- but my bus needs
one in a bad way!  Once I return from the trip, I _must_ rig something
temporary so my gas pedal fear doesn't materialize.  My bus is my sole means
of transportation, so it would suck to have the pedal fall out.

So that's the random word from me.  I have a couple things pending with the doc
project, but I've been so swamped with the semester ending, work, this trip,
and moving that I haven't had much time to address them :-(  

See you all again (hopefully) the 15th!
