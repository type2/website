Subject: Hydraulic tappets?

Hello!

I took the mystery 1776 dp from the '58 and put it in the '66....it sure
seems to make a lot of noise!  Mostly valve train racket.  I replaced all
the valve adjusters because they were all severely worn, and painstakingly
adjusted the valve clearance to .006"  No more no less.  Engine still make a
lot of noise.

It was mentioned to me that it is possible that the PO might have put
hydraulic tappets in this beast.  How do I find out?  Maybe they put a
crazy-lift cam in, and the extra motion is what is making all the noise, but
short of pulling the engine, yanking the heads off, and sticking an eyestalk
into the bores, how can I tell?

BTW....we're heading for Oregon this Friday for a 3-day trip...it'll be hot,
hard, and if this engine blows up I'll be mad.

Thanks!

Gene
