Next time you go to your local VW shop, look around for his junkpile of the 
alighnment tools. My guy here has 'em all hanging on the wall like a 
collection used beer bottles or something. Just ask 'em if you can have one 
or two of them.

I suggested the local guy here get his shop's name stamped on them and 
start giving them away to his old VW guys. Better than a damn keychain!
