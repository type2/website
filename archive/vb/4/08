You also have to make your own box lub; they give  you instructions
on mixing STP with grease.  Luckily I had a good oil can, which I loaded

of the two; the grease for leak-resitance, the STP for flow.  I also
added a couple squirts of 85/140 trans fluid just for good measure.

there.  Replace the bottom seal first, which will also drain out the old
fluid.



I guess my ram purged itself as I was in error.
