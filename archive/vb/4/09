I believe the middle seat is the same for a standard or deluxe.  the 62-67 
seats had chrome ends and rubber covered metal handle on the top of the seat- 
same sort of handle as the dash grab handle, except the ends are chromed not 
plastic.   

  The REAR seat for a deluxe carried the jailbar, the standard rear seat did 
not have that.
