the rear seat would be a regular splitty rear seat (an early bay will work, 
but are a slightly narrower width).

the middle seat would be the metal grab barred one, and as your kombi is a 
55, it would be the 6 legged variety, which was used through mid 56.  

believe you would used black upholstery.
