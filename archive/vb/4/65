Subject: Need sheet metal for '65

I'm finally moving the 21w project along. I thought the clips I had were =
ok, but now need a left rear corner piece from a donor.=20
The English cargo floors seem to be unavailable through the usual =
channels, so if anyone has a set they don't need, let me know.=20

The '66 Riviera is rolling on new front bearings and stopping with new =
brake shoes and cyls. They were competely gunked up with fluid and dust, =
the drums had rust pits because the shoes weren't hitting 'em. Guess =
that's better than grooves. It's a miracle that the nose is unhit, but may =
explain the fallover damage at the roofline and drivers door.  Next step =
is some hole and pit filling in the lower windshield channel. A neighbor =
mentioned lead as a filler. Anybody use this? I was going to use the thick =
POR15 from the tube.=20
