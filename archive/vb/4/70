Harry,

I'm in the process of buying 32lbs of the stuff and 5 lbs of the stuff. (two seperate purchases).  Going rate for lead is about $4/lb before shipping, I'm paying $3/lb, including shipping.   Some online places charge as much as $10/lb by the time you factor in shipping.

I can hook you up with 5lbs to play with if you want (very cheap)

You also have to get the wooden paddle to push the stuff around, the wax/tallow to keep the wood from burning, and the flux to clean the surface.  Those things are reasonably priced and can be found all over the place.

When I stripped the DC down to bare metal, I noticed that VW used lead on a lot of the seams.  I was surprised at the amount of it on the truck.

As far as window channels go, I would first tack weld in something to plug the hole from behind.  Then you could use the lead to smooth out all the rusties.

Can't comment on how easy/hard it would be to fill that area.   I have done windshields (not my DC) with a mig welder, set on low and used it to fill in the gaps.  I then used a flap wheel grinder to grind the welds flush.  By the time I was done, you couldn't tell that there used to be rust in the area.  (the work was done on corners).

Let me know if you're interested in the lead,

Scott
