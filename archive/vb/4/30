Subject: Re: [VB] Paint codes!

The last few cars I've painted I used PPG CLV.  It's 
very forgiving, not horrendously expensive - but not cheap -
and very durable.

A base/clear system gives a wetter look, but painting a bus
is a PITA enough without doing it twice!  You also almost
double your materials cost.
