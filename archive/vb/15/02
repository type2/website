Subject: VanBondo cartoon ?

 Hi Real Bus People   Ok, I will jump in and ask for
all us newbies fresh from the hatchery..Jim..Who is
VanBondo? And are any of those cartoons available for
the world to view? I am sure this is bus related or at
least I hope so.If not I will say....I have been
reading more on Mike West..passed on listee.His posts
are in the archives and if anyone wants to know more
about welding there is a good start...WOW!...
