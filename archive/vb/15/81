...pushing down on me, pressing down on you, no man ask for...

Specs from the '63-'67 Bentley are...

1200    1500    engine
3600    3800    rpm
   2.8     2.8  psi (pressure with closed needle valve)
  31.7    42.3  pints/hr
  18.3    24.4  in^3/min

It also mentions a newer pump (Jan '63 and up) marked "VW 3" and 
rated at 5.25 gal/hour, 400 cc/min, 2.8 psi maximum pressure.

>Any other suggestions?

Have you read http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/solex.html ?

If you still think it's too high, you can get a pressure regulator
to try and cut it down.  With everything right you "shouldn't" need
this but it might be something to try.

>BTW, I noticed some needle valves are stamped 1.5, some 2.5, one I have
>says 2.7; is this some sort of pressure ref?

From http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/solex/Page-07.jpg , "the
size marked indicates the size of the orifice in the needle valve
through which the fuel flows".  Bentley says this is in mm, and
also notes that 1.5 needle valves were used on 28 PICT, 28 PICT-1,
and 30 PICT-1 on 1200 and 1500 through '67.

I hope this helps!
