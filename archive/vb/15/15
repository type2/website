Subject: Re: [VB] VanBondo cartoon?-CLARIFICATION!~

I believe this cartoon went into the NEATO
newsletter...

------------------
To clarify, I crafted a few cartoons which were
published in the NEATO newsletter, Old Bus Review, but
it was the one which my buddies Matt and Katie have in
their possession which sort of ended the run.
Firstly, the premise of the VanBondo character was a
composite embodiment of all persons who muffed up all
of the buses strewn through out the world. Also,
VanBondo was further responsible for gluing shag
carpeting to the interiors, cutting wheel wells,
smashing the front noses into the backs of old Buicks,
creating custom walk throughs out of bench models,
hacking dashboards to fit the Muntz 8-tracks,
altering/updating the tail lights, tossing the
semaphores and substituting 16" barndoor wheels for
the Baja white spoke varieties.
Alas, Rusty's humor was too edgy to be embraced by
such of a family publication as the Old Bus Review. I
full defense of thier position, the strip in question
poked fun at the very individuals who were buying up
everything in sight and stepped on thier toes a little
too hard.
As an occassional cartoonist, I see it as my job to
tell the truth and offend folks- oops, I mean, evoke a
response. All true art does that. At the time in which
I should have fired up the strip, I got busy with
stupid crap like dying parents and pre-dotcom job that
ate up my time. Maybe I should do more. Everyone knows
that VW art is hot right now. It's the new trend after
all. F the buses and go for vehicle related art which
reflects no trademarked corporate logos that can get
your but sued. Vig Worporations who do that can kiss
my butt. I have other plans. ;-)
