Do like I do.  Hook up one or two T 1/3 back up lights to a switch.  I
use my over head light in my DC as I never use it...I just reach up and
turn it on and off.

A quick flash of the lights warns off any and all slow lane flyers! 
Works like a charm....just make sure smokey is not back there.  It is a
ticket if they catch you.  You can always say that your back up switch
must be malfunctioning.  How are they going to tell??
