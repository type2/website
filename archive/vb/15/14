Subject: Excuse me

Just a general orientation, folks. I've been reading this list only a short
while. Is there some bias on the "hippie" thing? I'm serious. I am all for
any and all VW bus owners restoring their buses. But I note this reoccurring
weird atmosphere: there's "stupid hippies" and "professional intelligent
rich arrogant pricks."

Given those extremes, someone would probably call me "a hippie" as if it
were some epithet -- except I'm old enough to actually have lived the
experience beyond the stupid stereotypes of the mass stereotypes or the
sometimes misinformed attitudes of younger generations in the entire
anti-philosophy of "being" a hippie.

(Historical note for those who weren't there: we burried the "hippie," a
mass media moniker, in San Francisco, in 1967. I excuse those who weren't
alive, but at the same time I indict popular culture and the mass media.) It
was great street theater -- another foreign term -- but something that all
should get.)

Thus, I would take offense only at the frame of mind; I'd still drive my
bus, which is what I thought this newsgroup was all about. Don't trash
people you don't even know. Let's just discuss VW's.What's so bad about
that?

Again, I'm just asking generally. No one's going to listen to me, I accept.
I just wanted to post to you all something more germane to the subject  (I
can see it now... the "officious asshole that I am...") that attempts to
remind its users that the subject is merely our mutual fascination with
these great automobiles; our personal or political agendas, ranking, oh, say
so byond secondary I'll have to get my reading glasses.

If I had some.

If this is not my place to say, I apologize.

But I wanted to say it.

Craig.
