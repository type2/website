Subject: Corroseal ?

I was wondering if anyone tried Corroseal on light surface rust as a primer.
Supposedly this stuff is mainly tannnic acid, is more enviro friendly than
other methods, and dries clear on non rusty surfaces. They also claim good
compatibility with top coats. I asked about DP primer, and it was a
confirmed yes. Thinking of this for the inside of my rails and
channels/jackpoints as a preventative measure, and a 'stop gap' on minor
stuff starting before I can blast/remove it for repaint.
