Subject: Re: [VB] Excuse me

right on, you dont see "hippie types" bashing you NRA supporting,
gun-slinging facists here on the list for what you believe in.  i agree,
lets just stick with the bus topic, that way we can all get along and agree
on something, right?  i joined this BUS discussion list to gain knowledge
about my vintage vw, not to be insulted and have some insecure, narrow
minded jerk(s) try and put me and others down.  hopefully this negativity
fades soon so i can enjoy the list.
