  Hey Thor (cool name by the way, I'll have to run that 
one by my wife!)
  You should not have that gas smell! check the filler 
neck and drain tube just inside the filler door for 
cracks/leaks. You should have a vented cap on there tho, 
so leave some room in the tank for the fuel to expand 
without overflowing.
  The only time I smell gas is when I fill up too far on 
a hot day and take a hard right hander.
