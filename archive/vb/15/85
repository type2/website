There's a couple of early Bus parts manuals online at
http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5054part.html  and
http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5867part.html  which may help.
The first one is a '54 edition (covers '50-'54) and the second one
is a '67 edition (covers '58-'67).  It won't give you too much in
the way of "if this frob is 16 mm wide it's for a 40hp and if it's
8mm wide it's for a 36hp" but it does give you the part numbers and
a few measurements.

You might already know this but the Tom Wilson engine rebuilding book
doesn't cover the 36hp at all.

Good luck!
