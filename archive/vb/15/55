Subject: '59 Walk thru for sale

I picked up a '59 walk thru his weekend. Nothing great, just a Kombi. But it was one of those deals
where I had to buy the whole Bus just to get a couple parts I needed. Anyway I'm either going to
sell the whole thing at Bug-O-Rama (or before) for $500, or start cutting it up for sheetmetal. If
anyone is interested in pieces, or the whole thing let me know and I can possibly bring it to Sac
with me. What's there is the body, and glass. No bumpers, taillights, headlights, etc.
