Does anyone know of a good sealer for the inside of my 1967 VW Bus. I want
to protect the inside of my van against rust and water. Also, I am looking
to reduce the noise and gas smell from the engine. I am new to this VW Van
scene but, I am having fun and plan on keeping my bus for a long time. I saw
"Kool Seal" on a web site but, know body in Orange County has it. Thanks,
Thor
