61 deluxes had padded sunvisors- a unique diamond pattern like the middle 
part of the 58- april 61 deluxe door panels.  In 62 padded sunvisors were 
stock on all splittes.    this is anecdoted memory info.

exact date of start?

Feb 20 61 ch 735 060  now: plastic mounting plate for the mirror holder, 
formerly die cast"
meaning ?beginning of 61 style sunvisors? end of hardboard/metal edged 
sunvisors-which had chromed metal for deluxes?

31 jul 61 802 986   sun visor  now: for front seat passenger
( beginning of regular grey or green sunvisors)

are you meaning 1960 buses when you say "1960s era"?   the vast majority of 
60s buses do have padded sunvisors, though they can be swapped around.

I think your 60 would have come with the hardboard kind- what kind of padded 
sunvisor does it have now?  Grey? Green? White?  stamped in diamond pattern? 
or cobbled 'elephant skin'?
