story (I like truckers!!And I only post this type of
email as a warning).. Was on a full moon night tearing
across the vast nothingness to Vegas in my old Jag my
charging system went out and when I got it
fixed...sort of...on the side of the road.I had to
drive with my lights off...crazy I know but heck I was
young.We were doing at least 100mph and I was none to
close to that truck ahead of me.Well I looked out the
window and when I looked back all I saw were brake
lights and a heavy load of pipe coming to get me!! Hit
the brakes and started to slide...No way this car will
stop in time..going sideways now at 90 or so...what to
do..what to do..I know take your foot off the brake
get your steering back and go around him.That saved my
life and then I got to try to sell my car to Robert
Urick(sp)when I spent the week watching them film that
old show "Vegas"nice guy to talk to at the bar until
the fans ran him off...needless to say I cut truckers
all plenty of room nowdays...        I do my best to
stay out of the way of truckers in the old Deluxe.Got
to make sure those running lights are nice and
bright.I like the slow moving sign idea...got to get
one that shows up well at night and hang it on the
back of the bus if on the road.....
