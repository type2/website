Just off the top of my head, I suspect that pressure would go UP with more
shims...at least to an extent.  Less shims would mean that there is less
pump-stroke being used. (in that it wont return as far down)


> So I am thinking that A) ya, too much fuel pressure.

2.5 psi is to much?!!!?  Ok, I MUST look at the bentley for this
reference.

My 68-74 book specs what I thought.  2.5-5.0 psi. (i used to run 5 psi
into a 30pict1 with a faucet style electric pump.)

Not really, see below.

Memory says that this is the travel of the valve pin..but i may be off
here.

This is the valve that SHUTS OFF the fuel pump (effectively) when the bowl
is full of fuel. (of course, this depends on the float height being
correct and the needle valve being shimmed correctly.)

If you have to much fuel pressure THIS VALVE STAYS OPEN. (ie: the fuel
pressure forces it open) This causes the bowl to overflow and fuel goes
EVERYWHERE that it can.


But, my brain is not into the jetting issue tonight, so i'll stay away
from that.
