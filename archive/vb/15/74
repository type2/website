the best thing to keep water out is to replace the window seals.  install new 
seals on to a nice smooth painted surface, using the magic roofing tar to 
keep oozes out

to reduce noise from the motor, make sure you have the baffles aka pods in 
the heating ducts- between the body and the heater boxes.

gas smell- investigate your gas lines- is something leaking?-  your should 
not smell gas, unless you just filled up and parked on a hot day (gas expands)

heard there is good sound proofer stuff you can put over the engine hump.  
Tar paper strips inbetween the ridges over the engine, and a foam pad for the 
Z bed work for me- I have more noise coming through teh front floor holes- 
road noise, and window rattles as the cab door windows need seals, and the 
rear cargo door got bent and squeeks.
