<<Just how close does one have to get to properly be pulled in by the
draft?  And
when drafting, how do you keep an eye out for the CHP?>>

Back in the early "70's (jeeezzzzeee!!), I took a long trip in a 36hp
beetle. Had to draft trucks the whole way. The distance required depends
on wind speed. But here is the technique: stomp the accelerator all the
way to the floor and climb that truckers behind until you feel the car
start to shake. Continue through this turbulance until you feel yourself
being grabbed and then ease back off the accelerator just before
slamming into the back and enjoy the pull. Now as you get to the crest
of that hill, if you can, stomp the accelerator and shift over to the
speed lane. Try like hell to gain some momentum on the way down that
hill because your truckers speed has likely dropped (if he is heavy
laden). Hopefully you can pass him and whip in behind another truck
because if he has to pass you on the right hand side and you have to get
in behind him again, he is gonna be getting mighty weary of this
technique. Basically, this should be used as an emergency kind of thing:
if you dom't have enough power to drive the highway safely, you should
be taking back roads.
