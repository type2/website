In one motion I will *try* to answer the many questions I have stirred up=
.

Yes, it's *just* a Kombi. I like commercial Buses. Nothing wrong with a K=
ombi I guess. Just not my thing. Yes, the walk thru seats are accounted f=
or, but I was planning on trading them to Lenny for some interior work. I=
f I do part this Bus out and someone in Arizona (you know who you are) wa=
nts the walk thru section I will sell them to you though. As it is right =
now it's a shell with running gear (motor, trans, brakes, etc.) in unknow=
n condition. All the glass is there. With a couple pieces cracked. Pass. =
side door window is the no hole thru the glass type with proper slider, e=
tc. while the drivers side has the slider, etc. but the "hole" style glas=
s. There is rust above the cargo doors on the roof, and some in the rocke=
rs as well as the front floors. Walk thru area and rear floor are beautif=
ul. Original color was Dove Blue (my favorite, even on a Kombi) but it is=
 know a non stock white over blue Kombination. No tail lights, no front t=
urn signals, no headlights, no bumpers, no front door handles, no turnsig=
nal switch, no steering wheel, 2 rear popouts, but no latches. 4 15 inch =
Bus wheels with tires, but no caps.

Yes this Bus has the potential to be a driver, I just don't have the time=
 right now. I can get pictures and post them on Everetts site if wanted. =
Bug-O-Rama is this weekend in Sacramento. If the Bus isn't SOLD (cash in =
hand) before then I will have it there.

Hope this helps,
Greg
