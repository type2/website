NO NO NO!!!

It took me 2 days to chip that rust promoting crap out both my front
doors and cargo door and drivers side panel!  The open cell stuff WILL
promote rust.  I was lucky as only a very small amount of surface rust
had started (So. CA truck).  I quickly tar'd the bottom inside of the
doors.  Seems to have kept it at bay.

BTW my '65 & 67 Westys came from the factory with battan type fiberglass
insulation under the paneling.  I guess they were not thinking of
longevety.
