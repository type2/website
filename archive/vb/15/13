I'm reading from one of my text books in college right now and came across 
a good quote from Scott Rice's _From Reading to Revision_.

"There is a pleasure to be found in contemplating anything well made, a 
pleasure in grasping its internal logic and appreciating the role of its 
components, in seeing how one part complements another or how it performs 
two or three functions at once."

Who evah sed we's unedjakated!
