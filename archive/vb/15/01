Most truckers don't like anyone riding their tail. Not
only from a safety standpoint (sure you hit him it's
your fault, but he loses time while the accident
report is filled out), but it adds to their fuel
consumption, or so I've been told. So unless the
trucker gives you permission (which, coming from a
family of truckers, is unlikely), don't be surprised
to see the truck change lanes, slow down, or speed up
to try to shake you.
