Subject: Re: [VB] VanBondo cartoon ?

We are lucky enough to have a signed (yes, autographed by Mr. Ellis himself) 
framed Rusty VanBondo cartoon hanging in our den.  Those of you from AZ will 
probably remember when Bug-O-Rama invited the mini-truckers in order to boost 
attendance...well, VanBondo had a statement to make about that and I believe 
this cartoon went into the NEATO newsletter...
