Hiya Ed, This list is like any other you have your good days and bad ones ,
just hang loose and ride it out ,it will be worth it in the long run. The
list gets side tracked  once in a while , thats why i get mine in digest
form. I can skim ck it if nothing exciting , i hit the delete button. Thom
and the other admin do a great job keeping everyone in line and on subject
matter , but everyone will stray now and again. ,,, Later
