I think they went to the padded visor in 1959 when they changed to the gray
interior. My early 1959 came with a padded visor, but only on the drivers
side.

   Who can tell me what year they ended using the chrome framed cardboard
visors in Deluxe buses. My new 1960 has padded, but all my other 1960's era
buses have cardboard.
