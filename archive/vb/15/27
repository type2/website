Like it or not, The hippie culture is an inter-related culture with the VW bus culture. No one can deny this fact. I would contend that we actually have the hippies to thank for keeping the VW bus culture alive long enough for us younger folks (32 yrs old ,BTW) to enjoy it. If it were'nt for the hippies, the republicans would have crushed all the buses in the 80's. Uh-oh, I went and did it, I flamed the republicans! But seriously, I also do not understand the hippie-bashing. Anyone who has met one of us, uh, er I mean THEM, would know that we, uh, er, I mean THEY are some of the nicest folks you could ever meet. Oh well, I guess we all are guilty of denying our ancestry at one point or another:)
