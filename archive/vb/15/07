Subject: 36hp help

I am wanting to rebuild a 36hp for my 59 singlecab.  I have a basket case =
motor, extra heads, an additional case, two sets of tin, manifolds and the =
typical bolt on stuff.  As I collect parts how is the best way to tell if =
I am getting things that will be compatable and interchangable.  Is there =
a parts checklist kinda thing out there on the web for 36hp motors?
