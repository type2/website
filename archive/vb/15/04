Hey Volks

Our site host let us down, so the ZebraSafari has not been
online. But I've registered my own domain and as of
yesterday we have a website at www.zebrasafari.co.za

The ZebraSafari has been on the road just over a month and
I'm writing this from Windhoek in Namibia. We left
Johannesburg as a party of four on 22 July but now there are
three of us aboard as Gina left us at the end of the South
African leg of the trip. The ZebraBus is holding up well and
has taken us over 5500km so far without incident, although
I've made some minor repairs to the rear hatch and an
exhaust leak. We move on to Botswana and the Okavango Delta
later this week.

Trip reports on the site soon, and a few photographs are up
already.
