Subject: Non Hippy Bus Stickers

Well, it's not an original idea, but I was selling these stickers at the
Ennis, Tx show earlier this spring, and since I saw someone was talking
about a sticker like this one, I'm offering these for sale on my website.
You can pay for these with paypal, and help support my double door panel
restoration!

Here's the site:

Thank you in advance

P.S. If you would like to email me, please respond to charles(-at-)thebugbox.com
, I check it more often than my type2(-at-)thebugbox.com, that way your email
won't get lost in the list postings (I have a whole separate email account
for the Vintage Bus list).
