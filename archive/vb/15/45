Subject: RE: [VB] What Gives?

   With out all the chit chat on non relative issues concerning our buses
the list would be almost dead ( delete all non relative subject matter and
you'd be down to less then 10 messages a day)and could easily go back to
joining forces with the type 2 list where we could all delete numerous
questions concerning bay window buses of which most of us split bus people
could care less about. It is a lot easier to delete subjects we don't really
care about then read through all the bay stuff. 
  The vintagebus list is full of a lot of colorful people with a lot of
different ideas and thoughts which does add color to this list.
  The off subject conversations or the recurring threads on lowering and
hippy bashing at least let's us know the list is still alive. I was a HIPPY
back in the day and am somewhat still one today, even though I do run a
business and have a wife, kids, house, no dogs, a Astro Van people mover and
talk to my neighbors.
  We could always start the tire thread again or maybe someone out there
really knows when they stopped using CHROME FRAMED cardboard visors in
DELUXE BUSES.


ronnie,  used to own a lowered bus, now only lowered due to the weight I
carry

Hi Ed,

There are some really good resources on this list... but there is quite a
bit of static noise.  I hit the delete button a lot!  I've been on the list
for more than a year now and there are definitely some reoccurring themes...
I was waiting for the 'lowered bus' thread to go ballistic as it seems to
come up every month or so.  Occasionally, the original post is different/new
in concept but it always reverts back to hippy bashing for some reason (and
I think there are a number of *hippies* on the list)... go figure.

Anyway, keep a good attitude, hit delete, and try and enjoy!


David
