 I disagree, John.  Until recently I only dissaproved of the hippy bus thing in private untill I was flamed by a couple of the "peace and love" crowd for deciding to remove the hippy graphics from my bus to restore it.  Since then I have been on the anti-hippy crusade with a vengance.  I dont mean to stir up the pot again and I agree that we should probably change the subject, as we can never reach a consensus on the subject and we will only cause hard feelings.  And of course you all read the flames that I published from last weekend. (from an obvious hippy bus fan).  The "Tie Dyed Dead Heads" are not any better than the rest of us.
I have perhaps been a bit too vocal on the subject so I agree to a cease fire and we should all agree to drop the subject.

right on, you dont see "hippie types" bashing you NRA supporting,
gun-slinging facists here on the list for what you believe in. i agree,
lets just stick with the bus topic, that way we can all get along and agree
on something, right? i joined this BUS discussion list to gain knowledge
about my vintage vw, not to be insulted and have some insecure, narrow
minded jerk(s) try and put me and others down. hopefully this negativity
fades soon so i can enjoy the list.
