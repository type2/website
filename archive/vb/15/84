Hi everyone!

       I was looking over a motor I found for my 54 and I noticed the 
distributor is siezed. I tried penetrating oil to no avail. I cant get this 
thing freed up no matter what I do. I did find in a box of wierd distributors 
in the shed, a Bosch VJR 4BR8 or 3, I cant tell as the ID plate has a 
scratch. The distributor that was on the engine is a VJ4 BR3. Are these 
interchangable by any chance? They look almost identical.  I dont have any 
info on these particular motors so any help would be appreciated. It's a 
barndoor motor, the number is 20-0840864, in case that helps. Also what 
number points, cap, rotor and condensor should be used? Sorry for the long 
boring post but in my spare time I'm going to be rebuilding this motor so 
I'll have lots of ridiculous questions as I go. Thanks!
