I have sitting in my pile of things a set of heads that I got from a buddy 
that got out of the VW scene. They are part numbers 113 101 371A (22) and 113 
101 371A (66). I have no plans for these and have had them for several years. 
The valves and sprins are in the heads, but the rockers are not there. If 
these will fit your need, email me to work something out.

Good luck - 

Greg
