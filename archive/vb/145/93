There is a guy Chris in CA who redoes wheels for $285
dollars. (still and old wheel!)Koch is another onenot
cheap either.
I think the ones that ISP sells are from Flat4, $189
is $11.00 cheaper than what I was quoted at my local
parts store. 
The real trick is getting of the old one! I have tried
everything, short of cutting it off!
