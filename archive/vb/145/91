Subject: New Steering wheels

Hello all,

I need to do something about my steering wheel.  I see someone on ebay (
Goes by the name Pimp Pride) selling repros for $189.  Has anybody bought
one of these, if so, how did you like it?  Mine is not so bad that it could
not be repaired, bit that seems to cost more than a new one.  Any
suggestions ?

Thanks!!

Bob
