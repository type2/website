Anybody that uses the phrase "yo bro" in their conversation will be
immediately suspect in my book!  
  


Unfortunately upfront and honest people like yourself are not
necessarily the norm....especially in the bus community.  Caveat emptier!

I also think you area bit of a marked man.  We all know the "players"
and while you may not consider yourself one, you are well known and
people will factor that in to their negotiation and price accordingly. 
You need a front man.  Dude you're a Havasu City celeb  ;-)
