Subject: New Brosol carb, now what?

Well, after a lengthy hybernation, DARTHVW will soon
be getting back on the road (two babies within an 18
month period, yikes!)

One thing I will be doing is replacing the carb.
I have a stock 1500 SP motor, dist, etc, and I want to
use the original oil bath cooler.

My current carb is shot, the last mechanic fixed a
non-idling problem by drilling out the idle jets, said
I'll need a new one (uh...Yeah? I only get about ten
miles to the gallon!). I don't think I'm going back to
that place again.

So I bought a new carb from Wolfsburg West. It's the
BROSOL pict 30-1 or 31-1. 

I checked the archive and found mixed opinions. I'm
taking this to a ACVW shop to be
installed/tuned/jetted. Got any recommends I can pass
on to the mechanic?

I found some old posts about size of jets, but not
sure what the consensus ended up being, and are the
BROSOLS really any different from the original
Solexes?

Any help would be great, thanks
Jason
