Subject: 55 to 59 floor mats

   I just recieved another shippment of 1955 to 1959 floor mats. I got 2
seconds in the batch and will pass on my savings to you. These are minor
cosmedic flaw and no way affect the performance of the floor mat.
  I have 2 only for $75.00 dollars a piece (regular price $125.00). These
are exact copies of the original with the correct waffle pattern etc.
