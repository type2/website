This is the reaction that I got from my friends where I was broken down in
Utah.  An email to the list produced in short order the information I
needed and a nearby source for the part (on a sunday in utah) as well as
offers of direct assistance.

My friends, who assumed that the lists and AIRS was someting like AAA,
asked "How much do you have to pay for that service?" :)

Remember folks, the thing that makes the list so valuable is the listees.
We all get an opportunity to lend a hand now and then, even if it is just
a ride to the parts store, so when that opportunity comes to you jump to
it!
