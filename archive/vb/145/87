  And here I thought nothing could surpass the ugliness 
of VW's new abomination. The new microbus surrenders, 
that thing is craptacular.
  It looks like the set designers of "Forbidden Planet" 
were locked in the "Monster Garage" with a bus, a drum 
of bondo, and a bag of bad peyote.

i just looked at the pictures of their latest project 
and all i have to say is 
that they should have designed the "new microbus" for 
volkswagen.  those 
taillights are sweet and the dash is so space-age 
looking!
