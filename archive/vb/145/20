Me too! I wondered if anyone else had bought from JCW. My channels were good
quality as well as was the other rubber I bought. My pieces had WCM labels
all over them though. I remember pricing the same pieces through WCM and
figured-out I saved over $150.00 buying it though JCW.

OK, so now that I have some back up, I'll come completely out of the closet.
I also bought my engine compartment seal and engine door seal at JCW, and
they seemed good quality and fit.

There! Now I've said it and I feel better. You don't know what it was like
hiding my face from others when they talked about their favorite VW parts
houses. The shame, the anguish, but it's over now. I can raise my head,
except if I buy cheap simulated chrome parts from Taiwan !
