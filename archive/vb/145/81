I hate when they do that. Hopefully it wasn't a nice 45.

I'm running a 110 Engle cam, 1600 SP. Mains are 120. Idle reduced to 55.
This is Brosol 30-1. I'd try a 116 or 117.5 and a 45-50 idle to start on
a nice stock 1500. Try to score larger air corrections if you need them.

I hated my brosol, but only because the stock washer under the carb shut
off waas too thin and it drowned the motor. Using the thicker Solex
30-2,3 speced washer helped a lot.

AL 66 DLX (still screwing around with that 72 fasty...)
