Well, definitely don't do it yourself if you stink. Do you have any paint
left over from the paint job? The toughest part is going to be blending the
paint so it doesn't show.

Also, it looks like it cracked through the primer. That means you have to go
all the way back down to bare metal and fill, re-prime and re-sand. If you
get out for under $200.00, you'll be doing good.
