Subject: RE: [VB] Bus F S/ peoples attitudes 

This is a situation I have with a saveable 70 square down the road. Sat
17 years, yet he wants 1295 (so specific!) for it. But this is the
opposite.... This guy won't shut up. Since he has some buick leadmaster
60 something vert with like 14K og miles (I immediately interupted, one
of the only times I could, and suggest X countrying it), he was a self
proclaimed expert. "the old VWs' are valuable, you know?". I never even
got to tell him I own 3 aircooleds (soon to be four, if I convince
myself to get this sweet 76 fat chick sportsmobile I found.) He just
went on and on, explaining how it needed a fuel pump, and I should be
able to just change the trans fluid and it would be fine...Yeah.... My
72 has like a mile of fuel line alone.
Perhaps I am one of the most jaded buyers, paying over 6 grand on
evil-bay (uneducated, I knew not of the majick of thesamba.com) for in
the end, just turned out to be a decent body and lots of OE parts,
instead of a driveable bus.
No matter how great it seems, I just walk now when they seem shady in
ANY way. Sad to see some just lay in that parking lot for another year
because of it, but oh well.
