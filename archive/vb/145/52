Curt, If you are using a new seal that has the white powder on it, make sure
you wipe it down with rubbing alcohol and then apply a thin coat in the seal
track. While the H2 cement is still moist it acts like a lubricant to help
slide the seal in easier, but doesn't deteriorate the rubber, neoprene or
whatever the seal is made of.

Volks,

Last spring I raised the issue of glue to use on styro insulation that
had been recommended.  I believe it was Ray Heath who recommended H-2
contact cement.

Is this good to use to glue door seals on as well?  If not, what to
use?

Thanks in advance,

Curt
