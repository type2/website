Subject: courteous T-2 drivers

So I was stopped by someone the other day and complimented on my courteous
driving and allowing people to pass, I wasn't, the gas pedal was floored.

A state patrol driver commented on my driving the speed limit and staying to
the right for faster drivers, My gas pedal was floored.

The city police smiled while bicycles passed me, thinking I was being a nice
Joe. I wasn't, the gas pedal was floored.

It's kind of like a light switch, up for off and down for on, relatively
speaking.
