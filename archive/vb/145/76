Doesn't sound like it was a positive experience.  Maybe you should cable a
complaint to the shipping company, and charge them for the damage.  It looks
bad, but just remember it isn't terminal.  Keep us posted!

I had something similar recenly - the battery came loose and smashed up the
taillight
pretty good.

I had a problem in the opposite direction. My battery slid forward and the
positive terminal contacted the air cleaner and arced a hole through it
leaking oil everywhere. Still have to weld up the air cleaner, but put the
battery in a plastic battery box.
