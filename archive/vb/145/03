This is what happens when you deal with the Public--For over 15 years I have
been doing FREE appraisals, and taking phones calls from lawyers and
Insurance Companies --fighting for the owner of a VW to get his fair
share.--But to some, it is never good enough,--I'm am asked to appraise a VW
through pictures and over the phone--I cannot do that--I Must see the car in
person--When I tell them that they get angry!!
As a Board member of NADA there are rules I must follow--But 99.999% are
cool--
So when I do win one, It feels good!! Soemetimes dealing with "The Public"
can be trying. But if you want to help "Keep Trying"-- TWWM, uj
