Subject: [VB] Pics of the truck online


Hey all,
I got pics of my 65 singlecab on the net if anyone wants a look. This is
pretty much how i got it but i did put a pair of NOS mirrors on it that I
had been saving . I plan on putting the chromie wide 5 wheels on it as soon
as I get some new tires.
I also have some front and rear bumpers from a deluxe with trim that are to
go on it.
