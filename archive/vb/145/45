Subject: Re: [VB] Driving from Jackson, Wyoming to Victor, Idaho

the summer after I got my 61 my exbf & I took a road trip out to the Rockies. 
 we went through Idaho to Yellowstone, and up to Jacksone Hole.   We also 
went up the north side of Yellowstone, which is quite steep.  or was that 
Glacier?    real nice pub out there.   I could be mixing up two trips in 
consecutive summers.  anyway, very pretty area, and the bus didn't mind the 
grades. (1600 sp, early 64 gearing) Definately recommend it for a bus camping 
trip.  Why didn't you take the bus?

for steep grades- the pass north of Yosemite over the Sierras gets up to 26%. 
 Don't be in much of a hurry over that one- lots of hairpin turns.

 I just returned from Jackson, Wyoming.  I saw quite a few buses there:  
Splittys, Early Bays, a few late Bays, and Vanagons.  I was wondering what 
it's like to drive the 20 or so miles from Jackson, Wyoming to Victor, Idaho 
in a Bus.  Seems like it might be a bit of a challenge with the 8000 ft 
elevation and the 10 percent grade.
 
 Anybody ever done this drive in a Bus?
