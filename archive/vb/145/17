Subject: RE: [VB] Bus F S/ peoples attitudes 

Hi Sean,
Think I said fairly priced in my post.  I'm not sure why it should be the
sellers responsibility to lower the price so you can tow the car home, or
get it registered, or replace parts that aren't right on the car.  If the
car is fairly priced, all of that should be a wash.  That stuff should be
the buyers responsibility.  If the buyer doesn't think the price is fair, he
should walk-rather than trying to play games with the seller.

What I'm talking about is the buyer who, after the seller has made all of
the deductions that would bring the car down to fair price in the buyers
eyes, (including towing the car home, or registering it, or whatever), he
still passes unless a certain price is met.

Also, seems to me that you should be blaming the guys who pay the high
prices for busses, not the ones selling them.  If you could get 30% more for
whatever bus you're now driving than your asking price, are you saying that
you would turn it down because it was an inflated price?

Don't mean to flame you, and I mean that sincerely, and I hope you won't
consider this a flame.  Guess we just disagree.  I'm not saying that I'm
right and you're wrong.  I think that whatever you're selling, whether its a
split bus, or parts, or your house, or whatever, is worth whatever the
market will bear.

Ed
