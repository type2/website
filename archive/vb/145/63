Subject: [VB] Help With Cylinder Heads


So I pulled my cylinder heads and, unbelievably, one side has long studs and
one side has short studs. Muir talks of this. One side is 113 101 371 A (33)
and the other is 113 101 373 (49).  The side with the long studs is the side
with the bad studs.  I went to the recommended local machine shop and the
guy there said that I could probably just order new/rebuilt cylinder heads
for less than it would cost to get mine rebuilt.  He also said that he
didn't think he could get the kit that was available to convert the long
studs into the short studs. How hard can that be? Anyway,  

With 40 hp cylinder heads with larger P & C's is there any machining to do
on the heads?  That is, if I just get new ones will they have to be altered
to fit my large bore cylinders?

Where can I get 40 hp cylinder heads?  

Does anyone know who can rebuild these around Ont?  

So each side has a different part number (see above) what's the deal on that
- I suppose there are other part numbers that will also work?

TIA

I would try and find 373B heads to rebuild, better rocker arm pedestals and
head thickness. Also, if you are going to stick with the 40hp block and 64
stroke crank/rods, I wouldn't really go above 83mm cylinders. You really
want that engine to last as long as possible. Cutting the block and heads
for 85.5 cylinders weakens the whole thing. You also want to case save the
block for the head studs.
