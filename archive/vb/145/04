Has anyone gotten around to reproducing the slider channel felt for the
solid slider glass with the latch mounted to the metal chanel? I want to put
the right windows back in the 57.

 Ron,
I am not sure who the manufacturer of my channel felt is, but I purchased it
from (here comes the thrown heavy objects) J.C. Whitney. It seems to be
really good quality (what do I know, I'm an engine guy), but comes raw with
instructions on how to cut the lock slots. I paid $17 for two windows worth.
