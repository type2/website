Volks,

I got my most recent issue of Mountain Bike in the mail yesterday.  In
it was an article by Marla Streeb, one of the women on the professional
NORBA race tour.  Her article was about the busses she's had during her
racing career.  Quite an interesting story.  They have been great
vehicles for such a career.

Best,
