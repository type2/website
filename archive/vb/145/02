That $100 could be the tow home, registration fees, a
motor "that doesn't come with it" (even thought it was
expensive than a new Ducati), ect. Or it could go
toward the purchase of the correct parts the buyer
replaced with crap from FLAPS just so he /she could
sell it fast! Everyone, including the seller, is
looking for a deal.

True, unless the seller is selling it OBO. 

Just my opinion, but some buyers are really idiots.

..and some sellers are weasels that are selling cars
at inflated prices.
