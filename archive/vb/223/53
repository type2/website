Hey everyone,
   I decided to try and sell my 57 on E-Bay 
http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=2408535965 
please give it a look, and don't try to restore a early VW in the Chicago 
area..............all the shops I spoke with for the last 2 years say its too 
FOREIGN!, whatever that means. If this don't work out off to California it 
goes. 
                                                                              
                           Steve
