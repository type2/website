If you want to buy new ones, Long Enterprises just quoted me these prices
(each). www.longenterprises.com

Fulcrum plates standard 113 517 191A    15.00
Fulcrum plates oversize 113 517 193     17.50

For comparison purposes, the ones that came out of my '65 have just the
slightest bit of burnishing on one long edge and a couple of scratches.
Not gloating, just relieved.  Sorry to see yours so bad.
