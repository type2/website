Subject: very strange oil leak..

Vehicle: 1959 kombi

Status: currently upside down in my garage on a rotisserie

Problem: oil is leaking out of the steering wheel onto the roof of the bus.

Yes, I know this may sound strange. Can the steering box oil leak out of the box
and down through the column? Are the boxes not a sealed unit?

The oil appears clean and there is about a 1.5 litres already (about half a
gallon) on the roof. This isn't a problem, I was just wondering why?
