personalized plates ARE swappable but you are supposed to go to dmv to do it :-)
my zapper plates have been switched to several buses and my cellair plate has been on 4 cars but
the title matched at the time and i still have my washington personal plates so if i ever make it
back i can put them back on zapper and not have to do it all over again!
