Hi Eric,
Kind of depends!  If it is just bent you or a frame shop should be able to 
use hydraulic jacking to push the frame back to where it should be.  There 
was even an article recently in the Hot VWs rag on straightening the door 
frame of a bug, which would be a simular operation on a bus.  We got a box 
kit of hydraulic jacking tools from Harbor Frieght several years ago.  We 
have not used it on a VW yet, but have used it to slightly lift walls in our 
mobile home when replacing the sagging 1977 particle wood with real plywood 
throughout.  
  If your frame is bent then the doors most likely would be at a tapered fit 
to the door openings.  If this is not the case then there is a good chance 
someone replaced the front nose of your bus (Yes, that kind of body work can 
be hid from most volks!) and did not get the door opening measurement 
correct.  If so the only way to fix it would be to cut and reweld.  Do not 
panic it can be done!
    Of course if the hinges are worn out the doors will sag downward at the 
rear, so carefull measuring of the door openings is a must anywhichway!
