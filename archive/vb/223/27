Subject: Beto Bus in HVW??

IS the 59 Deluxe on page 58 of the May 2003 issue of Hot VW's the owner is
named Beto Pacheco.  Is that the same Beto from this list.  The Beto that I
have met doesn't look anything like the clean shaven fellow that has his
picture in the mag.  Kind of looks like him but without the bandanna or facial
hair.  Is that the same Beto?  Either way congratulations on the sweet bus!
