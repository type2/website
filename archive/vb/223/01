Subject: Re: [VB] Non-walk-thru  boom boom 

I had a speaker box that fit 'perfect' in this location on my 66 Westy a few
years ago. Fit a 12" sub, and the area behind the storage area was enough
room to hide the amplifier. The sound was awsome, and I didn't miss the
storage space much. There's so many other cabinets in there, it's tough to
run out of room. I still have that box somewhere, but now I have a
non-walkthrough, and am faced with the same thing. Where to put the box,
where to put the box.....

I could alway put my spare up on the roof rack. <grin>
