  My 15 window delux has the mosaic bed/seats in it (bought at Pomona for
100 bucko's). When Mr. Tillman has the time he is going to make the other 2
removeable cabinets for me. 
  He does not have any written plans for these just original pieces to copy
from. He would be more then willing to make a mosaic interior for anyone if
the price is right.
  I think the hardest parts to find would be the original style spring
cushions.

i have the original brochure for 'is it a boat' with all the specs for the
vw camping car 33 and
vw camping car mosaic 22.  it doesn't really show a lot of the little
building differences but it
lists the parts for each and shows by diagram  and pitures etc.  i also just
sold a 63 mosaic to
mark lapriore so am familiar with eh parts out of the box so to speak.  the
biggest thing is how
the floor is attached to the bed halves and fit together to completely seal
the campkit from the
bus floor.  i'd be willing to share the infor with whomever can make the
plans.'
