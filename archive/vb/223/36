With fulcrum plates like that, I would be checking the side gears that the
axle and fulcrum plates fit into for hairline cracks if you have not done so
already. I have taken apart two transmissions like this before, where these
gears have been cracked and one of the fulcrum plates was missing about
15-20% of the metal. Gee..... I wondered why that snapping sound was there
when shifting gears....
