Well the axles are out of the transmission in Butch but I seem to have
run into a problem. While I am extremely happy with the condition of
the RGB gears I discovered a problem with the axle shafts. It appears
that the fulcrum plates have become damages at some time in the past.
This also seems to have causes damage to the axle shaft. Look here for
some pictures of the damage:

I suppose it would be good to get opinions on what my options are. I'm
guessing that the axle will have to be replaced for it to be any good,
but I don't have enough experience w/ these to say that for certain.
Thanks for any guidance anyone can offer.
