A 50% "derating" seems like a lot.  This formula would say to use a
35 A fuse for 2 100 W lights.  35 A in a 10 gauge (4 mm^2) wire is
pushing the limits for that size of wire, at least according to
Bosch / DIN VDE 0298 part 4.  According to the National Electrical
Code (for AC wiring, which is admittedly a different beast), 10
gauge wire is limited to 30 A overcurrent protection.
