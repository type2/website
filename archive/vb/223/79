Subject: Re: [VB] restore or not to

I say restore it to original specs;have the lettering done ect. I would only ask that you don't paint it that color on the second photo! Bleckk! 
Think about how cool panels are that are restored with all the lettering and all...
Maybe I'll see it at Red Barn?

To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no choreography, and the dancers hit each other.
