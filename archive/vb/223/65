Subject: [VB] Re: subhatch in a 65?

The owner of this particular yard is the quentiscential whack job flake-oh yard
owner. Several years ago, a friend who lives in Rhode Island planned a trip out
to AZ. The friend made numerous contacts and confirmations with this guy.
Detailed conversations regarding what the friend was looking for and what not
was intended. The friend was looking to buy a complete bus plus massive
quantity of parts if available.
Friend flew out to Phoenix. Friend and I secure mass qty of cash, make one more
call and tell him we were heading out the door and would arrive in X minutes.
We drove all the way down to that location and the SOB would not sell anything
because he was more involved in moving a bunch of Domestic Iron elsewhere on
the lot. He even would only sell entire vehicles, but not on that day. No parts
at all. The yard owner had schmacked himself in the forehead with a big long
jack as used by the 4WD crowd. We showed the guy the rolls of cabbage that we
were willing to spend and he still turned us down! The hatchwesty was, at that
time, missing the flip hatch. The open roof, open/cracked rear hatch and
nonsecured cargo doors allowed the elements living and dead to trash the
interior.
A later trip down there revealed that most of the stuff was gone. I doubt that
it would be worth anyone's time any longer. Besides the owner is still a flake!
