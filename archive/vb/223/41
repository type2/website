You might know this already but you're looking for a 9-digit number, not
a 17-digit vin like 1980-up cars have.  For a '66, the VIN should be of
the form 2x6 nnn nnn.  x will vary depending on the body style and nnn nnn
is the production serial number, which should range from 000 000 to about
177 000 or so.  If the first three digits are 2x5 it's a '65; 2x7 implies
a '67.  (Sometimes people are confused about what year Bus they have).

Besides the passenger side of the air vent like Andrew mentioned, the VIN
may also be stamped in the engine compartment.  Open the engine compartment
and look at the right-hand side.  There will be a diagonal seam at the
front (FRONT) edge of the rear piece of body metal -- the piece that
unbolts so you can remove the engine.  Look right in front (FRONT) of this
seam at the sheet metal that's welded to the body -- the VIN may be
stamped there as well.
