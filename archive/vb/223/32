had the chance to visit the john day fossil area last
week,& noticed the bus steering is getting
sloppy.....twisty two lane roads.


because of a lack of space, it's time to to sell the
oval window. the buyer is in Colorado & is searching
for transportation to get it there. Its located in No
Central Or, about an hour 1/2 east from Portland.
Any recommendations for a hauler from No.Cal, Oregon,
Wa.

thanks.
