Subject: Re: [VB] VIN

> Hi. I am looking to buy a 1966 bus and have a rather simple question...I was trying to find the VIN to be
sure it matched the title, but can't find it.
 there is a number behind the front seat, but its not the VIN. any help would be appreciated.

Your 66 will have the VIN in 3 places:
The complete number will be stamped into the body tin in the engine compartment. Look on the right side, on
the horizontal section, just in front of the apron. The apron has a diagonal cut to it and is held down by a
screw. The number will be stamped in front of the diagonal line. It will have a 6 pointed asterisk at each
end. It should sorta look like this: 2X6123456. The 1st 2 tells you it is a type2 bus. The X will be a number
depending on the model. The 6 is the year. The next six numbers are the sequential serial numbers.
The complete number will also be on the silver plate on the pass side of the air box mounted to the ceiling.
On the right side middle.
The last seven numbers will be on the M code plate that is held on by screws to the wall behind the pass seat.
Bottom row, right side. Using the example above, it would say 6123456.
Both the plates up front are removable. They may or may not be there.
The number stamped into the body in the engine compartment is permanent.
If the sheet metal is cut out in this area..... you have a problem and someone is probably missing a bus.
If this number does not match your title...... then all you bought was a title.
