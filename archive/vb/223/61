A good site that explains VINs in general (not VW specific) is
http://www.nsxprime.com/FAQ/General/vin.htm .  I thought the 9-digit
numbers that started in '65 were just a VW thing, but apparently it
was some kind of US requirement.  One thing this site explains that
I haven't seen elsewhere is how to compute the check digit for '81-up
VINs, so if anyone out there is forging a VIN plate to turn an '81
Vanagon into a '92 Multivan "Red Star" for Ebarf, take special note.
