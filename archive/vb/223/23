Right question, wrong list. Try www.type2.com :)
Yes, Yes, and Yes.
I"ve done it, and seen it done, installed in a late bay bus.
It will be "adequate", as in, it works. Sort of.
It will pass all kinds of emissions, including
everything you put in, as well as assist in creating some 
from the combustion of ingredients that you 
(or some governments ) may not want.
Google "Jack Kevorkian", ( 68 VW Bus )
The intent is about the same.

Lots of buses have carbs, all over the USA.
If your 1700 type IV is garaged in California
( and not intended for use on a highway:)
and not installed, you may still possess it.
Tell them Dave said it was OK !
