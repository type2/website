Subject: Re: subhatch in a 65?

There is a large rear window small sub hatch bus in Sierra Vista Az. It is
completely stripped of interior but very nice body and still has the 4 westy
tent alum things on roof. Last time I talked to the guy (which was 3 years
ago) he wanted $800.00 for it with an Az title. think it was a 65. Was og red
paint. It is on right side of highway as you get to Sierra Vista and he has a
bunch of old American cars also. Was an old junk year in years past. $800.00
don't sound so bad now days. Someone in southern Az go see if it is still
there. Richard K? go for it.
