Hi Jason,
Oh so nasty!!  That is the worst we have seen.  You will have to replace 
those upper axles.  If you just installed new fulcrum plates those axle 
shovel handle areas would just eat them alive.  With normal wear one would 
probably have those areas of the upper axles plated and remachined smooth, 
but we doubt that is an option in your case due to such advance damage.
