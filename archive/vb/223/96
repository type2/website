Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] AridZona VW Show

Jon Stanton, here, pres. of the ABC.  Hey, beggers can't be choosers.  It's 
bad enough that we are asking/begging for raffle prizes, we certainly aren't 
going to tell a potential donor what to donate.  We have as a grand prize a 
turn-key rebuilt 1600 engine.  For a second prize we have a 'new-in-the-box' 
DVD player.  ANYTHING anyone is willing to donate to the cause is greatly 
appreciated!!

As a note, the club generally doesn't make any money at this event.  Usually 
100% of whatever is made is donated to the charity, and sometimes we don't 
make much so the club kicks in on top of all the regular expenses.  Hey, it's 
a good excuse to camp, and relax with our buses before it gets too hot in 
'Aridzona', as Uncle Jerry calls it.

Thank you to anyone who can help out, even if it is just coming and buying 
some raffle tickets!!!

Jon Stanton, Pres.
Arizona Bus Club
