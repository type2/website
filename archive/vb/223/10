Touche!

We're getting the bus ready to drive down to Phoenix for the show in April,
and I can already see that the cooler and jank will end up on the rack.

Being that my boy is only 9 months old, we haven't really had a chance to
take the bus out for extended trips yet.   But you're right, I can see that
i'm going to end up using all the room in this thing.  Already been drawing
up plans to convert my (aftermarket) woodslat rack to either a 3/4, or a
full length rack. Unless I can buy extra parts for the rack seperatley,
it'll have to max to a 3/4 rack.
