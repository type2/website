Great pictures, especially http://fasterlaster.com/bus/tranny/parts.shtml

You should find replacement FPs.  Luckily they are the same as in swing axle 
bugs

The spade ends are well worn.    I really would find some better ones. Some 
people might turn the sides around , but that axle shaft is very worn.

<< Well the axles are out of the transmission in Butch but I seem to have
 run into a problem. While I am extremely happy with the condition of
 the RGB gears I discovered a problem with the axle shafts. It appears
 that the fulcrum plates have become damages at some time in the past.
 This also seems to have causes damage to the axle shaft. Look here for
 some pictures of the damage:
