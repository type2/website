<<Hi. I am looking to buy a 1966 bus and have a rather simple question...I

I think it was an insurance company i was talking to, when I told them the 
VIN for my 61, they said that's not the VIN,  it should be longer.   well, 
actually in 1961 yes it was a six digit number,  as through 64  models the 
VIN was a serial number.   VW went to the nine digit system in 65, which has 
been explained by others posts.  For 1970 models they went to a ten digit 
system.

It is always a good idea to check the VIN when looking at a VW to buy.   Just 
in case.  Remember that in some states they used to register cars to the 
engine number.   This would not be stamped anywhere on the body, only on the 
original engine, which may, or may not, be in the bus.  they did this in 
Oregon in the sixties, and I have seen a number of sixties buses titled to 
the engine number.  You can look up a rough estimate of the engine number in 
the Idiot Book, or other sources.  You can get the birth certificate and take 
that to your DMV and get the title changed to the VIN from the engine number 
(inspection probably required).  At least this is possible in WA state.

I know someone who had a very cool personalised liscence plate on her bug.  
The bug got trashed, and she bought another and swapped plates to keep the 
cool plate.  i don't know if she still has it and if not if she swapped the 
correct plate back on the car when she sold it.
