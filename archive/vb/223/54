Subject: Type lV motor problem

I have a 77 Type II with a 2.L Fuel-injected motor that I recently rebuilt.
After installing the motor, it idles fine, but when pushing on the
accelerator, the motor slowly dies.  I'm fairly confident that I put
everything back correctly, however, there is that "one thing" that I might not
have paid attention to.  Has anyone else had this problem in the past?
(Please tell me I'm not alone!)  I have faithfully read through my Bentley,
Chilton, Haynes, and "Idiot Guide" for advice and information.  I'm sure the
solution is going to be "simple" (as in "right before my eyes") but go ahead
and make me feel stupid anyway, as long as you provide the answer for me.
Thanks guys (and gals). Steve
