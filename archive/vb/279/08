Sheesh, where do you come from? Lighten up. This isn't
the R&R Forums.
In a way, you are jumping on a non-thinking bandwagon
that accepts anything as a resto. Yeah, "Resto-Cutsom"
would be a better term for all this, rather than
straight out "restoration", since (again) even Ronnie
isn't even calling it a restoration. IF (and that's a
big "if") Ronnie was to enter it in a show, in a
"Restored" class and won, imagine how upset the people
who actually had a restored bus would be. Wouldn't
you? I hear it all the time, peole bickering about how
custom stuff gets thrown in restored classes and they
win because people think that a pretty motor and fancy
interior work is original. 
My dictionary (Webster's Unabridged 1989 edition,
definiton #3) states: "restoration": a return of
something to a former, original, normal, or unimpaired
condition.
Maybe, in general, it would be a good idea to look at
the way other groups of automotive enthusiasts applies
the term "restoration", and get away from the "Hot
VW's" definition of things. 
Eric, I'm not flaming you and I really don't care what
you think or how you feel about it. 
*I'm just glad that Ronnie is getting a DC like he
wants it.* 
baaa baaa baaaa :)
