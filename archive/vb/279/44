  You can get a 6 volt case trans from Rancho if you request. They also
sometimes have 6 volt cases machined for 12 volt flywheels (which I prefer.
This way you can change out the bushing for whichever flywheel you have. You
will need to use your nosecone as Rancho does not furnish bus nose cones. 
  Also, make sure your supplier tells Rancho it is for a BUS. They have
started to beef up the bus trannys do to a few problems they were having
with people running largewr then stock engines (at extra cost, of course)

of course all the above is based on a split window bus

Hi people,

I'm buying a rebuilt trans from Rancho today via one of my local suppliers.

My question:

Will it fit right? My old one is the original 6volt, "professionally"
clearanced for 12volt.

Since all they sell are rebuilt 12volts, I assume the trans I'm getting will
be from a 67-71 bus.

Are they all the same? Will the linkages to my gearshift lever all jive?

Reassure me,

Billy
