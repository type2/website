Even though that's not a bad idea and it should definitely be done, it 
doesn't mean you won't get sued and lose the case. It happens all the time. 
Lawyers are very good at getting around matter of fact contracts that 
appear black and white.

In these litigious times there is basically no fail safe way to protect 
yourself from getting sued and losing a case regardless of right or wrong, 
guilty or innocent. And if you do win, in the end the lawyers still make 
out like bandits...which is the point anyway.

People settle these days as a compromise. Basically pay the lawyers off so 
they'll go away.
