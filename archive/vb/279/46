Subject: cyclone filter or not?

i have a few questions about cyclone filters ... specifically, what 
IS a cyclone filter for a bus?
there are a few  beetle/356  variations i've seen (often just a 
t-shaped tube), and the thing single or dual can version, but i have 
been having a hard time getting a definitive id on the bus models.

i recently acquired  what was sold to me as a cyclone filter, and 
while i don't doubt the seller's honesty, i'm wondering if the part 
is misidentified.
stamped part # is 211-129-611B. according to the 58 - 67 vw parts 
manual, this is actually 'larger oil capacity air filter M156' for 
1.5l motors (later the part # for this m code changes to 211-129-612).

there is a photo of a westy on thesamba that shows this filter, and 
that photo was described to me as a 'cyclone' filter. however, the 
picture does NOT match the one in the bentley... this 611B filter is 
vaguely egg-shaped in profile and has a small tapering snout which 
goes between the fan housing and the gas tank, and a normal (1 7/8"?) 
outlet going to the carb.
the bentley illustration (for 1200cc motors)  shows a more drum-like 
shape, and clearly shows a large, complex-looking hose leading BELOW 
the apron tin.
also, the parts book lists the SP (retrofit) cyclone kit as 
consisting of a 211-129-611 oil bath and a 111-129-605B as the ACTUAL 
cyclone unit.

anyone have more info or more pictures? did vw call the 611B filter a 
cyclone, or is this another case of 'ragtop?'
the singlecab originally came with a cyclone (M155) and i'd like to 
get it replaced, and i need to know if my search is over.

in fact, now that i live in phoenix, i'm considering putting a 
cyclone in the 70! :P
