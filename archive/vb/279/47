i have a few questions about cyclone filters ... specifically, what 
IS a cyclone filter for a bus?
it's a heavy duty oil bath air filter.   the air  * actually cyclones*  
through it.

   I think I have some pics of Roger Nang's cyclone filter, and of one in a 
nice Riviera.   very similar to the Thing filters, and I am not sur eteh 
difference, but evidently there is one.   Looks like a sort of eggish cylinder 
strapped to the right of the engine compartment.

pmail me if you want the pics I have
