Subject: Hiway speed again

I keep getting hit up by my nieghbors on how fast my truck will go on the
hiway. Speed is really a relative thing. Just this morning on the way to Totem
Lake Washington from Kent I blew by a sports car that had 6 times my
horsepower and cost 8 times as much and left him standing still. I just happen
to be in the 15 mph lane and he was in the 5 mph lane. Like I said, speed is
relative.
