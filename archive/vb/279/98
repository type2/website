Subject: Re: [VB] New welder for body work

JOHN! PUT DOWN THE GUN AND STEP AWAY FROM THE WELDER!
Flux core welding for body work is nothing short of a mess and not a new
type of welder/welding. Like the saying goes "You get what you pay for".
Flux core wire leaves just that "flux" in and on the welds. Just more work
to make sure it is cleaned out after welding. For a beginner and for body
work a gas mig is the way to go. I have a Lincoln 170 mig and love it. If
you are in the market for a mig unit buy a name brand (i.e. Miller, Lincoln,
etc.). As for cost you pay more but get a far superior machine than some
cheapo brand X machine. Also if you are going to buy a mig I always
reccomend buying one that is bigger than what you need. Due to the fact they
have more finer adjustments and once you learn how to weld with it , you
will find more and more projects to weld and wish you had went for the
bigger machine. Also go with a 220 volt unit and a good 220 supply (I put in
a new 6ga. supply line to my garage just for my welders). The 110 volt units
are ok with a good power source but most 110 feeds are too small of wire to
supply a mig welder with the power (line voltage fluxuations) it needs to
produce a nice weld. My Lincoln 170 is good up to about 1/4"+ depending and
anything over that I have a Lincoln 250 ac/dc arc welder. The 250 is a
pretty old one but they are very hard to kill. I also have a Lincoln 225 ac
arc welder but since it is ac only it is up for sale (I got it in a package
tool deal).
