See, there yah go - cheap HF crap!  I bought mine thru McMaster Carr
Co, and they are real nitrile gloves - strong and useable. Mine last
nearly forever. When I cut them on sharp metal, I put on a spare pair, and
repair the cut ones with Permatex UltraGrey hi-temp silicone, and put them
back into use. Turn'em inside out, smear some silicone on the cut, turn
them back out, do the same on the outside, let'em dry overnight - ready
for use.

I don't recommend HF for anything - to me, they seem to be a chinese
import company masquerading as a hardware store chain.
