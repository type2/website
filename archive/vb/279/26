Subject: 30/31 idle jets

At idle, my stock 1600 sp with stock air cleaner and brazilian 30/31
(almost new) runs REALLY rich.  I'd classify it as a "gross polluter"
here in the land of wacky elections.

I've dropped the main down to a 112 and it runs great and even idles
great once warmed up.  I think that the two idle jets are too big.  They
are 55/65 but I'm not sure.

Can I get smaller idle jets?  If so where?

Thanks.

Steve
