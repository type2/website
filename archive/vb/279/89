My turn! Your points should be set at .016 not .006. To adjust your carb you turn in the adjustment screw untill the car almost dies and then you back it out 1 to 1 1/2 turns. I have a stock dizzy for a 66-67 bug that i'll sell to you cheap if you want it. It sounds like a timing issue to me as well with a possible bad carb adjustment. I usually get about 20-23MPG in my bus, as a camper will get poorer milage than a passenger bus. I can take a look at it if you want, but I don't deliver!
