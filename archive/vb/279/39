At least "truck" has some bearing, seeing as they are 3/4 or 1 ton 
vehicles.
Here in Southern South America (VERY different from the popular 
conception that Americans hold of South America, which seems to be a 
curious amalgam of Mexico, Colombia and Central America) people call 
them "hares"
As in big long-legged speedy rabbit...
Why?
In the early to mid 50's public transport consisted either of electric 
streetcars, Ford or GM truck chassis with custom locally built bodies, 
or small Mercedes buslets which looked rather like bulbous 23 window 
deluxes. These Mercedes busses were much faster and handled better than 
most anything else around, so they became the preferred choice if you 
were in a hurry to get somewhere.
The first Type II's to get here were Sambas, so the name was 
transferred in the popular imagination to these (also german, also 
nifty) busses.
It helped that many Type II's were later pressed into service as school 
busses (picking kids up at their doorstep) and moms preferred these to 
American Bluebirds and the like since these had a tendency to flip when 
driven hard. Don't ask why school bus drivers thought they were Fangio 
or Caracciola at the Nurburgring, but some of my earlier school 
memories are of a busload of cheering kids egging the driver on as he 
passed another school bus on the outside of a blind curve, in the wrong 
lane.
Wait, maybe Americans don't have such a misconception of South America 
after all...
