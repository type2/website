When I bought mine from Ronnie he asked about gearing as well as the
6v/12v issue. Mine went in my 66 w/ no problems.

it shouldn't be from a post 67 bus. the tranny changed from the splits
to the bays. the RGB went away. Make sure you are getting a swing
axle tranny.

my rebuild did not have the nose cone with it (but ronnie already told
me that) so I pulled it off the old one and put it on the new one. if
it is the correct tranny it should work just fine.
