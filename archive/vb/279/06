Wow, guess what? I still call it a restoration, do you know why? Because
where I come from, there's different kinds of restorations. That's just how
it is up here. It's called "not being a sheep". Think for yourself. Just
because a group or a majority throws thier voice out there, doesn't mean i'm
going to jump on the bandwagon just to fit in or be accepted (the biggest
problem with the VW community). I've pissed of enough people doing that, and
i'm sure i'll piss off a bunch more.

So to me, yep, I sure do consider it a restoration. Technically correct, no,
but tough $hit if you don't like it. I do call things custom or vintage
resto's, and you don't. Sorry you don't like it. Oh wait, no i'm not......
