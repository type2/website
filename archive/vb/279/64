Subject: My old bus

The two gals who bought my old '76 a week ago have been having near daily reasons to stop by and have me check things.

Other night, they top off the gas tank to the rafters so it's leaking out the fill cap and the breather lines from the tank (it's an FI thing).

Last night, came by at dinner time cuz the brakes feel "funny".

I just replaced the master cylinder and redid the rears completely and new pads in the front. 

It's not getting any better than that.
