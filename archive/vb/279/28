I often hear people clarifying whether or not Mexico is in north 
america.  (VW connection - Puebla :-)

"Bring 'em on."  Depending on the audience, I call them "old VWs" or 
"vintage VWs".  What we do with them -- you mean the legal stuff, 
right?  I say "tinker" a lot.  "Fix up".  Mess with.  Play with.  I can 
see the argument for limiting "restoration" to original-stock efforts, 
but OTOH anyone who revives a decrepit old VW and makes it look half 
decent deserves some props.  And it drives me nuts (deservedly so) when 
someone sees me in my not-terrible-looking bus and says, "So, you 
planning to restore that?"  Grrr.  It *is* restored compared to how it 
looked before, dude. :-)

Repeating from p-mail, I think if you check online car-fancier 
glossaries and such you'll find that only in the VW community does 
"ragtop" not mean a convertible or drop-head coupe.  And I think it's 
at least partly due to the illiterati at the magazines.

You can have even more fun arguing whether VW ragtops (real ragtops) 
are cabriolets or convertibles.

How many people out there find that people refer to your bus (not a SC 
or DC or even panel) as a "truck"?  Whazzup with that?
