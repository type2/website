Greasy Volks,

The controversy over restoration and it's meaning reminds me of an
article I read about DNA, written by a Zoology Prof. here on my campus,
Duane Jeffery.

He says that humans have between 98.4 and 98.8 percent the identical
DNA as chimps.  Then he explains how not all DNA is coded, that is, has
a specific function.  Using only "coded," or known function DNA, the
identical DNA between humans and chimps rises to 99.4%. 

One disclaimer, while human DNA has been completely coded, chimp DNA is
only currently 70% coded, so the figure could go up or down in the next
couple of years that it will take to finish coding chimp DNA.

So, what this means is that I am probably closer to being a chimp than
My Sweet Bus is to being a restoration!
