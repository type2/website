Subject: buying trans today

Hi people,

I'm buying a rebuilt trans from Rancho today via one of my local suppliers.

My question:

Will it fit right? My old one is the original 6volt, "professionally" clearanced for 12volt.

Since all they sell are rebuilt 12volts, I assume the trans I'm getting will be from a 67-71 bus.

Are they all the same? Will the linkages to my gearshift lever all jive?

Reassure me,

Billy
