See http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/052898.html .

>anyway, does anyone have a wiring diagram?

http://www.type2.com/library/electrip/batis.htm is a simple one.
If your relay is marked 30 85 86 87, the 10 gauge wires mentioned
in that article go to 30 and 87, either one to either terminal.
85 is ground and 86 goes to the coil.

http://www.type2.com/library/electrip/axwir.htm is a little more
complex circuit.
