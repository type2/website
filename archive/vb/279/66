Subject: Re: [VB] Driving my Double Cab

I get that all the time. My standard answer is, "They didn't have Fords or 
Chevys in Germany, they had to make their own trucks. The U.S. manufacturers 
caught onto the VW "minivan" but haven't copied the 3 tailgate idea... yet."




After driving my bright orangish-yellow DC daily for 5 years, I've decided to 
reduce my projects, clear out the driveway and concentrate on my '65 21 window. 
The '71 bug is gone, the '74 Thing will get a new engine and be sold off 
locally, '79 Westy will go to a deserving brewer soon and the DC will be put up 
on the block. I need to fix a few electrical gremlins and do something about the 
paint, so look for it at the October OCTO or Pomona a week later. '63 with a 
1970 T1 rear end welded in, 1835cc with baby Dells. Cut and turned ball joint 
front end with disc brakes and polished cookie cutters. 2" lower than stock, 
chrome window frames front and back with chromed German safari's. Interior is 
sound abated and recent tasteful upholstery. Uncut dash, oil pressure & temp 
guages, good stereo.
