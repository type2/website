Hee hee.  Aren't terminology arguments fun?  Some huff, "You're a bonehead if you don't use my -- excuse me, I mean *accepted* --  terminology", 
while others adopt Humpty Dumpty's line from Lewis Carroll: "When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean - neither more nor less."  Both 
fly in the face of pragmatism.  Word meanings reside in the receiver, not the sender.  

Besides, until everyone straightens out and calls ragtops by their right names, I'm going to refer to them as I see fit: saucepans.
