Subject: clutch adjustment

Help, anybody?

A friend and I just installed a new engine in his '63 Single Cab.
After a day or two of driving, all of a sudden, the clutch wouldn't
dis-engage.
A couple of turns  of the adjusting nut seemed to give the recommended pedal
freeplay and restore clean shifting. The strange thing is that a couple MORE
turns and again, the clutch won't dis-engage.

Anybody make sense out of that?

Comments/suggestions, please?
