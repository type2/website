Thanks for offering them to us Ronnie!

   Thanks to all that purchased these cases, after all said and done I still
have 2 left at the $250.00 dollar price. When these 2 are gone that's it. My
importer has informed me that there has been a major price increase from
Brazil on all VW parts, so when these are gone they are gone.
