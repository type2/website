Subject: RE: [VB] Driving my Double Cab

It just proves that one needs at least 5 or 6 busses; minimum.  I'm
still thinking I need a high roof, ladder, and wide bed, and the wife
keeps bugging me for that 23 window deluxe.


David
...11 and counting... well, ok, only 4 aircooled busses.



Thom and Rex both can't decide...


> from rex: The other thing I notice...I'm not really a big Double Cab
guy. It's cool 

> from Thom: Sometimes I feel the same way.  It's really a compromise
between the
kombi and the single.  I wish I had the longer bed, but it's nice
having the extra room inside.  If I had to choose between the panel
and the DC, I dunno which way I'd go...
