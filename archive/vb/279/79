Tom,

Be sure to check the ID of your bus frame holes to double check my memory.
When I wrote my heat-improvement article, I specified the duct hose from
McMasterCarr having an OD of 2.65", and ID of 2.5". I believe that I went
out and measured a spare piece of the silicone hose in order to be
accurate, but there is a slight chance that I put that dimension in from
memory and looking at the MC catalog. So, do the measurement. The hose is
not cheap, and you don't want the wrong size. The hose fits nicely into
the frame holes, not loose, not tight.

The heating I get is very good and that silicone fiberglas hose is never
going to leak. The insulating sleeving is holding up like new, 9 years
later (recall that it is POR15 coated).
