I've always wondered about that one.  They both have
rags on top, so which is a real ragtop?

And, as Rachel knows, I prefer "busses", but in the
literature for our upcoming "Busses and Balloons",
it's spelled both ways.

And don't forget Busses and Balloons - October 3, 4,
and 5 - Albuquerque - music, free lunch, raffles,
trophies, lots of fun.  And special for this year
only, it's Ronnie's 50th birthday party!
