Subject: Re: [VB] cell phones cross country

 I just got back from a trip from NV to TN and back. We went down I40 to TN
 and came back down I80. We got one of those Trac phones from Wal-Mart, and
 only used it when we needed to. We were in the middle of some important
 things that just happened during our vacation. We used it quite a bit, and
 did not have any problems during the whole trip.
 I wanted to get a CB to help spot Smokies, but did not time to get it and
 set it up.
 Bottom Line:
 Cell phone worked fine, at least along I 40 & I 80.
 Good luck, be safe and have fun!!!
