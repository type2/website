Subject: door panel & speaker install

I just wanted to say thanks for the suggestions on my door panel and speaker
installation. I finally posted some pics on the samba.

They are in the '68-'79 truck section, although I think it applies to all
buses.

If you have trouble finding them, let me know. Search for pics by
kguarnotta.
