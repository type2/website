Subject: Weepy transmission seam

Long time lurker, occasional poster.  Looking for opinions on a nuisance 
which appears to have no easy solution.

My 67 Doublecab is not a daily driver, just a weekend errand runner.  
Occasionally I may take it a couple of hours drive away from home, like 
to a VW show.  It has about 110K miles on it and is in excellent 
original condition for being 40 years old.  I've been it's guardian (I 
hesitate to say owner) for almost 9 years.

This summer I took out the 1500 engine for a leisurely rebuild.  I'm 
also taking the opportunity to service the tranny since it's easier to 
reach.  New axle boots, input shaft seal, check the throwout bearing, 
and so on.  I topped off the GL4 (quart low!), came back the next day, 
and found some serious weeping (and a little dripping) from the seam 
between the tranny case and the gear carrier (so THAT'S why it was a 
quart low!).  After I read Section H-6 of the Bentley manual, there does 
not appear to be an easy way to loosen the pieces, spread open the seam, 
and re-seal it with the tranny in place.  Or is there?

With the engine already out this is the best time to attempt some 
corrective measure, but I'm not keen on removing and disassembling the 
tranny just to fix a slow leak.  Do I have any options that are more 
practical?  Do I just live with it and top off the GL4 more often, bite 
the bullet and take out the tranny and get it fixed for good, or is 
there a home remedy for sealing seams from the outside that will do for now?
