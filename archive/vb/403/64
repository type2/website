Subject: Re: [VB] upgrade rear window?

They worked fine when new....but it is 30-40 years later now.

In the late eighties I?had a '73 bus that the rear window defroster worked on... but then some bars stopped working...
basically, they will work if the defroster bars in that piece of glass are in good shape.
You might want to test it and find out, before installing the wiring and modifying/replacing the rear hatch.
I don't know if new defroster windows are available new.

The defroster bars in the rear window of my '69 beetle no longer function, they never have?since?I bought it in '91.???I would like to buy a new one with good defroster action, but couldn't find one.? And that rear window was used on many many cars (65-79 I think, which could?mean millions of beetles).?? Not being a broke student anymore, I'd be?happy paying a reasonable amount for?a nice new one.???I did get a new windsheild for it, only $30 or so, very cheap I thought.

I think the rear window defroster was standard equipment for N Am spec VWs as of '68, but that it was an option elsewhere.

Clara,

So why would it not work? Was that feature one that did not work so well on
the bays?
