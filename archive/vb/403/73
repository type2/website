hey guys  I went to the boat store and got a couple of bouy mates, I  also 
bought extra clips so that I could transfer the holders over to my canoe.  These 
work real well as they swivel and the cup or can wont spill no matter the  
angle(not counting upside down which has happened in the canoe but not the bus  
:) )   later  mark dearing
