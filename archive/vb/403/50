Subject: Re: [VB] Outer popout seal replacement

You have toremove the pop out window, but you don't have to take the frame 
apart.

?Those little screws can be a bear... 
Make sure you have the right size screwdriver.
Get some penetrating oil, such as pb blaster. WD40 is not penetrating oil.
Put the screwdriver in the slot and tap the end with a hammer... do all the 
screws.
Repeat daily for a week.
After a week, try to unscrew the screws.?? The lower ones tend to be more stuck 
than the upper ones.
Those little slots are easy to get funky.
?If you completely mess up the screw, you can drill it out, but be really 
careful, you don't want to mess up the threads in the frame.

?It's better to be patient about removing the screws. Then again, I'm used to the damp PNw 
climate, your bus may be dry and the screws not as rusted as I expect.

Okay, you have the frame out. (Whew!)
Remove the old scraper seal.? Use a razor knife.
Clean the slot in the frame where the new seal goes. There with be dirt and?old bits of seal in there. get all that stuff out. use an old toothbrush if? you need to.
I use WD-40 or glycerin or pb-blaster as a lube to get the new rubber in place.
Clean and wax the window ledge before installing the frame w/ new seal.

If the screws got messed up, you can buy new ones from WW. Use grease or?antiseize on the threads when installing them. 
It's kind of a pain to get the frame in with a new seal, you have to push to get?it lined up. get one, then you can pivot the frame. Once they are all in,? install the pop out latch. The latch has some adjustment when you attach it, don't tighten it all the way until you are sure it is in?the right place.

Oh ya, use baby powder on the seal where it goes to the body.
I installed a new scraper seal on my red bus ~4 years ago, and it is still hard to 
open.

Hi All,

How do you replace the flat "sweep" seal that goes around the
perimeter of popout windows?

Do the frames have to come apart?

Thanks,
Tristan
