Subject: Another old bus back in Missouri!

Hi all,

At 1:07 pm this afternoon we rolled a sharp-looking primered 1959 Double Cab
off a trailer and into my driveway for the next chapter in its long and
eventful life.   This old bus was sent by me down to a buddy in Texas for body
work with the understanding that he could take his time, and  in return I
would receive the benefit of a super cheap labor rate.  Well, lot of stuff has
happened, all water under the bridge, and now ten years later the bus is back
at home for the final stages of its restoration.  Needless to say, I'm
thrilled and in love with another bus again.

My eternal thanks go out to a great friend and fellow bus lover, Roy Jonas,
for constantly urgeing me to get off my ass, get the bus back up here and get
this bus project rolling again.  He unselfishly volunteered his time, his tow
vehicle and a nice trailer for the 3 day roundtrip to go collect, load up and
bring the D.C. back.  My thanks also go out to Dennis Wilson for all of the
awesome work he did to bring her appearance back to beautiful and for taking
good care of the old girl.  We still have a few more things to do before
she'll be ready for paint, but it's so nice to have her back in town again!

Gotta go... I'm gonna sit in the garage all evening and stare at her and make
long lists of all that I have to do now.

Bill Bowman
