Subject: quietcar paint?

Has anyone used this stuff? Quietcar.net

I was going to try it on my single-cab. I was going to put it in the doors,
I read on the site it recommends putting it on the wheel wells.

Would you put this on the inside or outside? Any suggestions on
locations/application methods appreciated.

Thanks,

-Kevin
