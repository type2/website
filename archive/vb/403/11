Great link on shift backing plate but you guys never miss on 
information, what happened?
Any way the locking door part can be changed with later one to lock on 
the inside as this was good for our 59 DD as a camper.
Now you can drill a small hole and insert a pin too stop the latch from 
working from the outside this was a camper mod of early commercial bus 
doors.
