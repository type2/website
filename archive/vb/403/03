 I did. I have the original owners manual for my bus, it makes no
mention of what that other switch is/does. All the pictures show only
one switch to the right of the steering wheel. I always thought a PO
got creative and added it, but after seeing several other '63 buses on
thesamba's gallery I think it is factory.

The wiper switch to the left of the steering wheel, and there are two
similar switches to the right. One is the headlight switch... the
other is a  2 connector (I think) switch that isn't connected to
anything. The whole harness has been hacked so the connectors were
yanked off at some point.

On my 66 and 67, that switch is the hazard switch.  That is why it is 2
terminals.
