Subject: 2008 VW Calendar Photos

 Hi all

last year I asked for help to choose some photos for a VW calendar I was
working on, I had a great response and lots of positive feedback, Thanks for
that.

Circumstances prevented me from finishing the calendar in 06.

But I have finished it now for 2008.

 If any one would be interested in seeing the results I have all the photos
on my website www.surfingart.com.au and I have a special webpage for VW
clubs & groups vwclub.surfingart.com.au that you are all welcome to.

All photos are from  Australia so the RHD may look a little unusual to some :)

cheers & happy 2008

Peter
