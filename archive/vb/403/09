I have a 64 delivery DD. The original lock mechanisms can only be locked via 
the exterior door handles. There are some newer mechanisms, presumeable from 
deluxe models that have a little toggle on the inside. I managed to get one 
to fit my doors. Look at swaps and you should find some.

    I'm thinking this will end up being a dumb question, but is there anyway
 to lock the side doors from inside? Last weekend my son and I took our 
sundial
 over to Port Angeles and when time came to say good night I couldn't find
 anyway to lock the side door.
    tell me it doesn't take crawling over the front seats 8 )
