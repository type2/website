Subject: Re: [VB] door foam

They used a square of foam maybe 3"x3" around the door mechanism post between the door and the door panels.

They did not stuff foam insulation (or any insulation)?in the door.?? 
The door is designed so rainwater drips through it and out the drain holes on the bottom of the door.??
 If there is anything in there like foam or the fibregalss insulation that will hold water, it will help rust the doors out quicker.

Pulled off the door panels on the 66 today and found what appeared to be
factory foam in the door. Did the factory ever put foam in the doors or was it
left open for water to drain?
thx
