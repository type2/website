Subject: Re: [VB] quietcar paint?

Kevin,

Have a look at these guys.

http://www.secondskinaudio.com/

Especially the Damplifier and the Spectrum products. Have not yet tried 
them. They will be my next effort at quieting down my bus. I bought a quart 
of the Spectrum just to see what it is. Looks promising. There is some very 
good info in the forum. One guy did measurments in his Vet. Dropped the 
noise inside from some 90dbA down to 70 some dbA. Very impressive.

Cheers!
Chris

I was going to try it on my single-cab. I was going to put it in the doors,
I read on the site it recommends putting it on the wheel wells.

Would you put this on the inside or outside? Any suggestions on
locations/application methods appreciated.

Thanks,

-Kevin
