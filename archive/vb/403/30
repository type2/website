and re-seal it with  the tranny in place.  Or is there?



Hi Chris,
The only possibility is you just try and retorque (to the proper  amount) all 
the nuts on that seam and see if it seals back up.   Otherwise you will have 
to just pull the tranny, and have a tranny shop fix it  for you.
  How is the shifter feeling??  It might be a nice addition to  fix up and of 
course you have to remove the tranny to do it up right.
