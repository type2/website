Chuck,
Eric&Barb found the link to a pic

Drill a hole through the bolt(latch) For a small pin.
This keeps the blot from moving back and opening the door.
The chain just retains the small pin as not to lose it.

Hi P&C
we'll have to let them slide on this one ; )
how is that lock modified? I searched for it on samba but all I found where
people having trouble opening their doors.
As mine works perfect I think I'll keep it and modify it instead.
thx
Chuck

Great link on shift backing plate but you guys never miss on
information, what happened?
Any way the locking door part can be changed with later one to lock on
the inside as this was good for our 59 DD as a camper.
Now you can drill a small hole and insert a pin too stop the latch from
working from the outside this was a camper mod of early commercial bus
doors.
