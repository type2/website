Subject: side door lock

    I'm thinking this will end up being a dumb question, but is there anyway
to lock the side doors from inside? Last weekend my son and I took our sundial
over to Port Angeles and when time came to say good night I couldn't find
anyway to lock the side door.
    tell me it doesn't take crawling over the front seats 8 )
