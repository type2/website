Subject: ADMIN: Archives are updated

All,

The archives for the Type2 and VintageBus lists have been updated.  They
now contain all the list mail through October 2007.  The archives are
available at http://www.type2.com/archive/ .

Also, Type2 has reached a small milestone.  On 8 September 2007, the
Type2 list had its 100,000th message since we moved to our current
server in July 2001.

Thanks!
