Subject: Re: Fw: [VB] light switch?

My bus is a '63 model, built 10/10/1962. My owners manual is dated
October '62, presumably for the '63 model year.

The picture isn't of my bus, but one I found on the samba's gallery.
It has the same switch configuration. There are no red lights near the
switches, the only red light I know of is the generator light on/in
the speedometer.

I'm sure the switches are factory, the holes that they are installed
in still have the original dove blue paint on the edges, a hole cut
later would not have the paint.
