Searching the archives, I found one of my old posts in response to this same
question back in august 2003:


"I have one that was made by a list member, if I remember correctly it was
Richard davis who fabricated these. I think it was a one run thing...it is a
fairly simple device the screws to the under side of the dash(I actually
used a pre-existing hole, so there is no need to drill).

I don't know if he still makes them...if there were enough demand he might?"

I don't have mine with me, it is back in Boston, in my ez-camper. Sorry I
can't send any pics. You might find some pics on thesamba.It has worked fine
for years, There were a couple modifications I have thought about making,
but never got around to. He did a nice job on them.
