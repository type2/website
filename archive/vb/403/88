Subject: Bus Depot Clearance Sale - Up to 90% OFF!

For those of you who missed our on-site Garage Sale in October (during Buses
By The Depot), I've put it online.

Most items are 50% to 90% off.  These include customer returns,
one-of-a-kinds, discontinued items, scratch-and-dent, overstocks, and so on.
You can find them at the following link:

http://busdepot.com/garagesale.jsp

Inventory will change throughout the month, as I am still adding items.
(Also, any items that don't sell may be reduced in price.)  I expect the
best deals to get snapped up pretty quickly as they go online, so check
early and often.  All sales are final.

The Garage Sale items themselves do not qualify for your list member
discount.  But they do count toward the $50 minimum purchase required to
kick-start the list discount. So, for example, if you bought $30 worth of
Garage Sale items and $20 worth of non-sale items, the non-sale items would
still qualify for the discount since the total order was $50.
