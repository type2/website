Part of the reason I am always cold is I have no ass. but the heat 
coming out of a primitive VW, which is the only kind I want, is 
minimal, and I think, HOW DID GERMANS SURVIVE IN THEIR WINTERS? did 
they bundle up or what? To me, the high coolness factor of an older 
VW is a high charge, which makes up for lack of comforts. also a loud 
radio helps. I do not COVET the ownership of a modern warm cuddly 
car. I rent them when I need to get someplace, and also in LA i would 
live in terror of people doing SOMETHING to my precious car. Because 
they would.

lately car design, contemporary car design, seems at an all time 
bottom low disgusting I HATE THEM ALL state of being. and I wonder 
how this happened. I frown thoughtfully about this.
