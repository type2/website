Subject: Re: [VB] light switch?

 Hello Eddie,
 Attached is a photo of my '63 15 window, production date 31/01/63
 For more detail I think this photo can be opened to full screen.
 As stated the 3 switchs shown match up to the owners manual location wise.
 The 4-way flasher switch is left of the instrument pod. You can see the
 blinker light just above the switch. On the right side of the pod the
 1st switch controls headlights and instrument lights and
 the 2nd (out from the pod) on the right, controls the wipers. Since this 
was
 a local bus all its life and I have most of the history and documentation
 I'm inclined to think this is factory. I think your is also with the
 exception of the absense of the flasher light. I can copy those pages out 
of my owners
 manual and forward those to you if you like.
