Subject: checking altenator

I haven't had any luck searching the archives.  This
is for us who have the 12 volt altenator conversion. 
How do you check to see if your altenator is working
or if your battery is shot?  I woke up to a dead
battery, put it on the charger for a couple hours and
drove to work.  When I went out to start her up the
battery was dead again.
