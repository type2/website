Subject: RE: interested in info on used to be panel

Isaac,

Sorry Isaac, but it came with the windows already installed. However, I
have copied the rest of the board and I bet you'll get excellent
information.

Good luck,

Jason

Hey sorry this has nothing to do with your bumper, but
you said you have a used to be panal van, did you put
windows on it? cause i am looking at getting a kombi
because i really want windows but can get a killer
deal on a panel. so i guess i am asking if you put
windows on your panel van, and if so was it really
hard?
sincerely,
isaac
