Subject: Re: [VB] RustBuster Spray Welders

a few years ago i had a neat gun that sprayed metal onto any surface 
you needed filled... had an oxyacetylene torch, and  a spool of wire 
of whatever metal you needed that ran through the flame; this 
vaporised the metal, and compressed air shot it onto the surface of 
the work. i used it to build up worn machine parts (you then 
polished/ground the part back down to spec). sold it to a guy who 
used it to spray his aluminum sailboat and smooth out dents.
they are on ebay for a couple hunnert....   if i could remember the 
name of the damn thing!
