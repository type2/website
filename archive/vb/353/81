Subject: Complete OG  paint 63-15 window found in a Pick & Pull

Was taking a power nap on Sat. when former listee Mike Anderson knocked on
my door.  He had been in a Pick & Pull looking for minivan door gaskets for
his SO-34 resto.  Said there was a complete, original paint 15 window
hardtop deluxe walkthru among the minivans! Everything there including
complete engine that turned, all 5 wheels, interior, except for the
proverbial middle seat & floor mat.  What to do, what to do?  Mike had
helped himself to 1 curved glass window, all the jail bars, rear bumper,
some door pulls, the radio & speaker bracket, etc. but everything else was
still there.  I went w/ a buddy to look at it, & we decided it definitley
needed to be saved.  The bus is very straight, w/ major rocker, 1 dog leg,
rear wheel well rust issues, & entire roof w/ surface rust.  We offered to
buy the whole thing from the place, but they didn't want to sell whole as
there is no title.  We said "no Problem" to title issue & hope to still save
it. Stay tuned.

Tom Buese-thank god my buddy has room for more projects in his driveway-I
don't
