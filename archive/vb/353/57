Subject: VW Bus ZipZap body

Here's the first pics of a ZipZap body I' working on.  Made it from 2 Japanese
mini RC bodies.  Needs some more work yet, but if it works out I'm going to
mold it and make some different ones.  Posted to Bay list also cause I'm
working on a Baywindow version also, not very far along with that one yet.
