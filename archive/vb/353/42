Subject: Shift plate question

Hey all,
I picked up a Bentley '63-67' big blue Type 2 manual at a local used bookstore for $50 the other day and as I was leafing through it I noticed in the shift adjustment section that the shifter bolts directly to the floor. On my '65 there is a spacer of sorts between the plate and the floor. It is the shape of the plate, is about 3/4" or so high, is made of aluminum and has a two cross members. I have come across one of these before, in fact I have one in my spare parts box, but what is it? Is it necessary? Or is it some aftermarket device?
Thanks,
--Dan E
