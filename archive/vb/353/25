Well I have to admit that all I did was look at it and did not use one but I 
did use a Harbor Freights powder coating gun with Eastwood powdercoat and I 
was really impressed!  Did my 5 rims in a gray (Not sure if I like it so I 
might blast the fronts and go with the off white/lighter gray. Could I mix 
the 2 polymer colors to make a light gray? I will see what they look like 
with the tires) and I did the air intake in HARBOR black.  It was a really 
rusty air intake and even had to weld up some holes in the bowl but it came 
out pretty nice.  Here is a pic of the rims!
