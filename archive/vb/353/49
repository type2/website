I agree w/ David, even tho it will probably cost you more.  I went thru this
in my 63 DC. Blew up 1600 engine & installed another w/ a newly "pro"
rebuilt longblock w/ my own rebuilt kadrons-ran like crap w/ left carb
flooding crankcase, changed oil, fixed carb, ran good, & threw a rod w/ 700
miles on engine.  Damn! Long block rebuilder says my fault for carbs, not
his.  Now got 2 complete motors w/ rods thru top of case! What to do, what
to do?  Went to a very reliable hi performance local engine
rebuilder-started w/ new case, pistons, cylinders, german heads, oil pump,
reground crank, rods, cam, etc. He rebuilt the carbs, new generator, 009,
fan, rewelded tin, & reused the rest of my good old stuff for a new turnkey
1776 motor.

"Runs like a sewing machine" but probably $800-1000 more than an all new off
the shelf motor from some guy in the back room of GEX, or Bergmann, etc. Any
issues, I have full local service, who knows exactly what's in the motor &
how it was done, cost-priceless!

Tom Buese-motors, you can't drive w/o 'em.
