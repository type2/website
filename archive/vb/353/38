Hi John,
First check your battery cables on BOTH ends to make sure you have clean,  
tight connections, and use a multimeter and check for any voltage drop.   Then 
try starting the engine and see with the multimeter if your voltage  goes up 
when you rev the engine.  No rise in voltage especially if lights  are turned on 
means most likely the gen/alt or the regulator has  gone bad.
