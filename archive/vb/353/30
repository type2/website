Just had a couple of colors made up at Paint Mart. I think it's the
types of paints that are EPA regulated. Got acrylic enamals for one
vanagon and one bay.

 I don't think this is the case anymore. I did it years ago, but about
 a year ago I tried to do the same thing at my local paint shop, said
 they couldn't due to EPA restrictions anymore. :(
