Subject: Complete OG  paint 63-15 window found in a Pick & Pull

.....  We offered to buy the whole thing from the place, but they didn't
want to sell whole as there is no title.  We said "no Problem" to title
issue & hope to still save it. Stay tuned.
.........

Update: The Pick & Pull will not sell this bus whole. Has anyone else dealt
w/ this issue.  It is to nice to strip & crush or cut up.

Tom Buese-15 window waiting to be saved
