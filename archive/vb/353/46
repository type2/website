Subject: New VW longblock vs build up from scratch

Hi All - Just wanted to get list opinions on this.  I am budgeting for  
a new motor for my 60 dc and I have a local reputable builder who will 
work with me on this.   I will be having him basically build me a 
turn-key, using all the extras from my donor motor.  I have zero time 
right now, having just bought an old farmhouse, and I need this truck 
working now.  I can order a new vw longblock and have it shipped to 
him, or he can build me a new longblock using all new parts from the 
case on up.  I'm interested in hearing list wisdom on the 
advantages/disadvantages of either scenario.

Any opinions welcomed

TIA

Don J
60 DC
