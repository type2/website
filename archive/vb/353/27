Subject: RustBuster Spray Welders

I went to the World of Wheels show here in Omaha last weekend and there was 
a booth from http://www.carsrusautobody.com/ a auto body shop here in town 
and they had a new spray welder http://www.rustbustersllc.com/ so I went a 
visited them today on my day off!  They charge $100 a hour but it really 
seems like a good product!  He showed me where they had filled some 2 and 3 
inch holes with the welder but it is only for commercial use as it needs a 
special booth and respirator as it is spraying Zinc into the air!
Really looked like a cool set up and the way that I should get the roof 
fixed on the 23 window. In this pic you can see the holes I need filled on 
the right side of the roof http://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/190257.jpg
