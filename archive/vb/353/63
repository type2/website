Subject: Cibie H4 headlight conversion

anyone have a set they are willing to part with or know where i can get 
them. i only found one place, online, that ive never heard of.

i will be driving my bus much more this spring/summer/fall as a work vehicle 
and we all know our headlights stink. i can go with Bosch, but i like the 
Cibie's better.

thanks,
