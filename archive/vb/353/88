Both Karl and I have finagled a bus off a salvage yard. They weren't quite out on the lot but they had CA salvage titles. It helps to scout staging areas or know a manager. I have seen vintage BMW's disappear off lots too. Must be some kind of green exchange. 

If you have a vintage bus book, take it out to the manager and show him there's a need to save a bus. Use a Jackson as a bookmark.
