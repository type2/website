Hey John,

Another possibility is the fuel tank isn't venting properly.  When
that happens, tank pressure can force gas through the fuel pump and
the needle valve in the carb.  You might want to make sure the gas cap
is vented if this is an early bus, or that the evaporative emissions
stuff is working if it has a charcoal canister.
