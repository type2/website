April 16, 2005 - Bring Your Own Bus '05
Aromas, California
Richard Stewart and Strictly Vintage 2s brings you the 5th Annual Bring 
Your Own Bus event celebrating the box of choice at the Big Red Barn off 
Highway 101 in Aromas, CA (about 40 miles south of San Jose and 15 miles 
north of Salinas). The swap meet is huge and the show is open to 
everyone! Camping is available at the Barn Friday night for $10. Swap 
spots are also $10. No cost to enter the show, just register for it. All 
entry fees are charged by the management of the Red Barn! Gates open by 
8am Saturday, two raffles at 10am and 12pm, we wrap it up so you can go 
get ready for Kelley Park by 1pm. For more information, contact Taylor
