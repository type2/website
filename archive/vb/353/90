Subject: Bus meet???

Hi bus lover!,
I plan with 3 other vw friends to fly to San Josi CA for the Kelley spring
meet on April 17Th. If I remember last year there was a bus show the day
before in the San Josi-San Francisco area. Is there a similar meet this year
in the same area the day before.
Any VWs stuff or place to see in that area?
Thanks for input.
Regards
Claude Lapierre
