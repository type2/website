Subject: Re: [VB] Shift plate question

Hi Dan E,
It is part of a short throw shifting kit.  If your shift linkages are  tight 
and shifter bushings are not worn the shifter should be plenty  tight.  The 
shifting in our 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion, was a  difference of 
night and day when we replaced all the worn parts!
