> Hi all, I have a 66 sc and it is my daily driver. On the way to work this
morning I was running about 65mph on the freeway and started to hear a whine
coming from the right rear. So I got off the freeway, reduced my speed and
the noise went away. I checked the r/h RGB and the oil was low. (sorry so
long) While I was there I noticed my r/h axle tube has a leak where it
attaches to the transaxle. My question is this (finally) Does the transaxle
share oil with the RGB'S? The reason I ask is because I checked the l/h RGB
and it was low also.Thanks for the help, Bob
