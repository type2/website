Hi John,
If the throttle shaft is not worn out, most likely the carb is still in  good 
shape.
1.  You need to check your fuel pump push rod to make sure it is not  
reaching too high and thusly over pressurizing the fuel pump.  Are you  using the 
proper fuel pump with the proper fuel pump push rod?  The  alternator style of 
short fuel pump requires a shorter push rod.
2.  Next did you replace the fuel shut off valve in the carb?  It  could be 
too worn or stuck.  Also did you install the gasket to seal the  shut off valve 
to the carb top?
3.  Could also be you have too heavy of shut off float or it is  
cracked/leaking fuel into it.  
4.  What size jetting are you using?  You need a set  of jetting gauges to 
make sure of size!!!  By now the jets could be  worn bigger or DPO drilled them 
out, and we have often found new jets to be  often stamped the wrong size!
 
  Frost on the intake manifold just below the carb is normal  in the right 
temp and humidity conditions.  Yes, the 30 PICT-1 carb will  work just fine if 
it is jetted correctly.
