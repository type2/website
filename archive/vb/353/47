Subject: Re: [VB] New VW longblock vs build up from scratch

I'd spend your monies with whom ever will give you good service.  Some
would rather build it themselves so they know what is in it instead of
chancing it to someone remote.  I bought a recondition trans once and then
took it down to have some beefier side plates and a super diff in it and
was told I would have done much better to have had the person doing the
local work just do the entire job.
