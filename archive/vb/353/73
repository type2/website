Subject: RE: Re: Cibie H4 headlight conversion

hey matt,
thanks for the informative post. my plans are to upgrade to H4's and then 
install a set of xenons. they draw 20 less watts and produce over 3 times 
the light. i just want a good set of lights that wont throw that light all 
over the road and into oncoming traffic. the Cibie's with their ecode beams 
seem to be concentrated just right. i got a recommendation for the Hella 
H4's but they dont have the ecode cutoffs that i like. and im also 'voltage 
meter challenged'.

thanks,
Bob in Cleveland
