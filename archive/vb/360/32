Not to "Berg-bash" by any means, but Berg also promoted his "semi-hemi" cut
that eliminated literally ALL the squish area of the combustion chamber so
it was obvious he did not understand what benefit squish had with regard to
combusion. With a semi-hemi, you have to advance the timing a large amount
which indicates a very inefficient chamber design. (Flame suit on).  ;-)

What a tight deck height does is this:  When the piston comes up to the
clylinder head, it squishes the air out from between the piston top and the
flat surface area of the cylinder head. When setup properly, it will force
this air/fuel mixture out at super-sonic speeds forcing the mixture to mix
much more efficiently. After .060", this force is reduced, and by .100", the
benefits of the squish is all but lost. Forcing it to mix with a tight
deck-height creates a much more efficient combustion chamber, reducing any
lean spots in the combustion chamber. More energy goes toward making power,
than making heat.

I personally would rather modify the combustion chamber a bit on each
cylinder than run excessive deck height. It's a lot more work than just
putting shims on the barrels, but the engine is a much better "product"
afterward.
