 he suggested sandblasting.

I know there are a lot of different types of media to
use when doing 
this. I
think I remember "black beauty" or something like that
being 
recommended-and
there was a source for it relatively cheap around
Boston.

lots of choices for blasting media, this one comes to
mind, although i haven't tried it is walnut shells,
would be less abasive than sand?
