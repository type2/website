Looking over the '64 wiring diagram, there are only about 90 push-ons in
the electrical system.  This means that there are only about 1.49 * 10^138
(that's
149,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
)
ways to connect them all.  There are a few things in the electrical
system that take two wires and it doesn't matter which way you connect
them (like the brake light switch), so there is more than one right
way... by my count there are about 24,576 right ways.  In other words,
if you hook wires up at random, there is about a 1 in 6.04 * 10^133
chance that everything will work.

In reality, the chances are a lot better than this, because the wire
lengths are different and most people can get the right bundle of cables
routed to the right component.  If you only consider the wires that end
up at the turn signal switch and the fuse box, there are only about
941,500 trillion ways to hook them up, and about 6 ways that will work,
giving you a 1 in 156,900 trillion chance that any random connection
will work.

In so many words... Check all the connections against the print.  :)

This is one of the reasons why the auto industry went to connectors with
multiple circuits in one housing.  The harnesses can be built and tested
ahead of time on a test fixture, and then the assembly-line worker only
has to do one motion to connect 30 or 40 circuits.
