Hi Everett,
Many things like, full flow filtering of the oil, running straight weight  
oil in warm weather, keeping to lower engine temps, etc., are longevity  issues. 
 E.G. if you followed 100 guys who started to smoke  at fifteen years old, 
two packs of cigarettes a day.  With  another set of 100 guys who did not smoke. 
 After 40 years, odds  are you are going to have a lot more sick, or dead in 
the smokers  group!
  A VW repair shop we trusted many years ago noticed that before the  55 
national speed limit, the type 4 engined buses went  easily 200,000 between engine 
rebuilds if properly maintained  and often could get up to 300,000 miles.  
But when the speed limit  went above 55 MPH, these engines required rebuilds 
more in the 100,000  miles range .  Higher RPMs and engine temps seemed to be the 
 culprit!
