Check the wiring of the turn signal switch and the grounds at the tail
lights first, then go through all the other connections starting at the
fuse box.  When you're playing with the wires, have the battery negative
strap disconnected - hook it back up to test.  This is because many of
the hot wires in a Bus are UNFUSED and you can cause tens or hundreds of
wire-melting, fire-starting amps to flow with a short circuit.

If you can find a visible part number on the new harness, you might
consult the harness vendor to ensure that the correct harness for your
Bus was installed.  You might figure it out on your own if you discover
lots of extra wires, wrong-color wires, or wires that are too short or
too long when you check it against the wiring diagram.

As Clara mentioned, color wiring diagrams are available at
http://www.vintagebus.com/wiring .  Print it out on a color inkjet
printer, go to someplace like Kinko's and download and print it on a
color laser printer (should be less than $5 for the computer rental and
printing), or download it to a floppy, CompactFlash card, or USB drive
and experiment with one of those "print your own digital camera pictures"
kiosks at the general store.  If you're really into it, make a copy for
the shop and a copy for the Bus, and think about having it laminated
(especially if printed on an inkjet).
