Kevin,
Try to find a seatbelt buzzer or other noise maker in a salvage yard. Maybe Karl could tell you where they're mounted in Mercedes Benz'.  If you're 6v, you might have to find one at Radio Shaft. FLAPS may have a backup light alarm that can easily be wired and would be loud enough to be heard over a screaming engine. 

BTW, Karl and I put the engine in my '79 Westy using the sagging tranny method last weekend. 15mm rear tranny hanger bolts have been mastered! Need to replace fuel lines, install engine seal, hook up electrics and start 'er up after 3 1/2 years. Note to self... trickle-charge batteries, change oil filter and fill with oil.
