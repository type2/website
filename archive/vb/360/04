The problem, as you mentioned, is that the info is from 1992.  As you 
mentioned, oil additives improved dramatically after that date.

From personal experience in multiple Volkswagens, I have had higher oil 
pressures at idle with Castrol 20W/50 than Castrol 30W.  This is with an oil 
temperature above 212F.  After 1992. I do not have experience with other 
brands.  I use either 30 or 40 wt now because someone else convinced me that 
having 50 wt oil in your engine, unless it is really worn, is a bad idea.
