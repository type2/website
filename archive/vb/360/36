Subject: Stock muffler on a 1776?

Got my header from Ronnie, don't know what it is, but it works great. Key is
in insulating your bus. Just finished insulating the panel and took it on a
drive around town. Worst part was I couldn't hear the engine at all. Had to
look at idiot lights at stops to see if engine had quit or not. Really weird
not hearing engine. I installed 200 sq. ft. of BQuite ( used to call it Brown
Bread) rubber/alum sound dampener and 2 complete layers of the
alum/plastic/alum bubble insulation. Covered roof, sides, floors, doors,front
nose, rear hatch. No paneling installed for now, will do that after VTO
weekend campout. BQuite is costly, but well worth it I think, goes on real
easy also.
