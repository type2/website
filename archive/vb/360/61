Subject: the dead horse to be beaten ( High oil temps on highway)

Yes more overheating - sorry to have to beat this one.
I never had a oil temp measuring device in any VW I have owned (gasp)...so
I recently installed a gene berg dipstick on my new (to me) 56' bus. I 
was suprised at the results; the bus overheats after driving about 45 
minutes on the highway. This is at ambient temps of 60F and at sea 
level.  This made me wonder if I was punishing my last bus...

Here are the tech. details:

SVDA dizzy (dual advance unit) timed at about 7.5 btdc about 28 at full 
advance

34 Pict

valves ok

fan belt tight

no debris in fan shroud

doghouse oil cooler w/ tin in place

front engine tin in place

1600 dual port AE case (supposedly balanced) with 8k on it.

running straight 30w

56 bus with tunnel tranny (unknown gearing) HUGE tires 235/75R15 (yes 
they rub)

I just recently swapped out the dizzy: it used to have an 009.  It 
overheated a bit more with the 009 and  I did not like the 009 w/ 34pic 
combo anyway.

Also the crank pully has only some hand etched marks for engine timing - 
should I be wary?

Basically the oil light starts to flicker and then goes from flickering 
to solid .  It seems that my oil temps hover around 240 or so.  
Interestingly, if the light starts to flicker and I pull off on the next 
off ramp, it goes solid as I decelerate and put in the clutch.

Do I need to check my oil pressure relief valves (dual relief case)? or 
what?
Suggestions appreciated.  I have read the previous thread on this 
subject and am aware that engine timing and engine bay vacuumm could 
cause this.  I have tried to retart the timing to 0deg TDC but I don't 
like the hesitation.

Thanks
