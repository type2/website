Volk-a-maniacs,

Well, I found another reason to love my SO.  She went shopping and happened
upon a new comforter at Meier & Frank.  She brought it home, made the bed with
it and I didn't see it until crawling into bed later than night.  Very cool.
It has a print that includes VW busses (with an appropriately smudged emblem),
bugs, and a beach scene.

To see it, go here: http://www.deanmillerprints.com/dm351.htm
"DM351 - Baja Road Trip" is the print.

It looks like one, if one desired, could order the material for other
projects.  Curtains maybe?  That is, if one didn't mind all the bugs.

Happy bussing.
Greg

P.S.  We are packing up and taking those 4 busses from the gully, home this
weekend.  Then we can really see what parts are still parts.
