So would you recommend an S&S muffler?
The one I have on the bus right now is a screamer. I have 2 layers of JCW
heat shield all over the interior as well as 1 layer on the floor covered
with 1/8" of rubber for a sound barrier. The paneling has not yet been
installed and the noise in the cab is huge on the freeway. No way to hear
the radio, and I have turned it up. Its almost all engine exhaust noise.

Thanks,
Chris
