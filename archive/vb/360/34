Subject: need help with bus year

Hey folks,

I have a 15 window possible project and I have no idea what year it is.

The louvers into the engine compartment go inward.
No back up lights.
Large round flat front turn signals
The tail lights are the late oval like the early bays
The rear hatch has a small window in it. I mean it looks odd (all the others 
that I have seen are proportional (it also has a crescent imprint where a 
handle would go and a possible round badge just above it.
I am not sure if someone was getting crafty with the welder but it looks to 
have a giant mud flap hanging from the front clip. (aerodynamics?)
This thing is worked and I'm not sure it is worth my time.

Any suggestions would be great.

-Joe
