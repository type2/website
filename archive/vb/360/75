Subject: the once and future dowel

steel and aluminum are one - no way that dowell was coming out. it 
was made of some extra sh*tty brazil or chinese steel... soft, yet 
brittle. vice grips, nail cutters, punches - none could get a firm 
grip, all served merely to mash the top into a pulpy, jagged dome. 
applying heat made no difference, as the case just soaked it all up. 
tried to use the 'chisel a notch and spin' method; that merely peeled 
off chunks. oddly, it was too hard a metal to allow my starret hand 
taps to get a bite.  all i ended up doing was making a pointy nub 
instead of a smooth one, and marking up the bearing saddle.

screw it.

seated the crank again, buttoned up the case. crank spins nicely 
after assembly, so at least the bearing seems seated. if it spins, it 
spins.

i ended up using 3H and some unwaxed dental floss, a la some users in 
the archives. i worried it might interfere with bearing crush, 
but...... again, screw it.   if i can get 5K more outta this motor in 
the next year, i'm happy. after that, we move to manhattan for a 
year, and the van gets parked in  a barn somewhere anyways.

after stephanie finishes her NYU fellowship, the theory is that we 
can then afford to fix all the remaining or newly-created glitches 
properly. actually, the theory is that i will then buy a new AS41 
case and start over :P
