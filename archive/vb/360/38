Subject: Re: [VB] Stock muffler on a 1776?

I have a similar amount of Dynamat Extreme inside the bus on the floor,
walls, doors and roof. I also have 2 layers of the JC Whitney Heat shield
batting on the walls and roof. The floor has 1 layer and a layer of 1/10"
thick dead rubber. I also lined the roof of the engine compartment with the
JCW Heat shield stuff.  Wish I could say that I can't hear the engine. it is
still quite loud.

Given the subject line of your post, do you have a stock VW muffler on your
engine? or is it a header and quiet pack muffler?
