Subject: oil cooler efficiency

anyone out there have a vw service bulletin, tech sheet, college 
physics project or other on how efficient the vw oil coolers are 
supposed to be? either percentage or actual degree drop, or whatever 
they would use to measure such a thing. i vaguely recall seeing a 
post or webpage from someone who measured oil temp going IN and oil 
temp going OUT, but can't recall who or where. clara? veewees?
