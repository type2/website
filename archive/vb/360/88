Subject: Re: [T2] deck height

There is SO much more to a combution chambers resistance to detonate than
compression ratio. I can run my 12.2:1 race motor on 91 pump gas without
detonating (It just runs really hot!) with the help of the tight deck height
(.043"), having smoothed all the edges in the chamber to avoid hot spots,
and having a cam with enough overlap to allow it.

My boss has a street motor running 13.5:1 on pump gas and it runs cool as a
cucumber. He is running a custom piston design with a combustion chamber
design to work with it that really makes an efficient burn. More energy
toward power than heat than with a normal flat-top piston design.

It is never as simple as "more compression makes you run hotter". Too low of
compression will make you run hotter in a lot of cases too. Match the
compression to the rest of the motor combo.
