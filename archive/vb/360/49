Subject: Re: [VB] spring plate bolts

Yup, what Bob said, 
 
 don't tighten them before all are in.   Usually the bottom  rear is the 
easiest, sometimes I use a jack to help position the box, but the  box definitely 
needs positioning to line up the bolts.   I try to do  the forward one second, 
definitely not last.   then to do the top rear  bolt I have to snug the 
others a bit (not torque yet!!!)   
 
It also helps to use tap and die on the bolts and bolt holes... so you can  
screw them in by hand... and use grease or antiseize on the threads.  be  nice 
and careful not to bugger up the threads by cross threading the  bolts.  start 
them by hand.

this is  challenging, take your time. we just did a tranny swap this spring. 
all  the bolts will need to be loose when trying to get them all started. you 
 
just have to wiggle and fight with the axle while starting the last one or  
two. be careful not to strip them. they also should be tightened in a  
certain order per the Bently.
