Subject: deck height

ok, eric a. had mentioned what a nono it was to go too much over 
.065" in deck height, but i couldn't remember why some people said 
it. in fact, i reread my berg manual, and he says 'who cares.' or 
words to that effect :)  he saw no problems in deck heights heading 
for the hills, and was more concerned with CR.

so.  who out there has some more tech info to digest while i have the 
aluminum bastard apart? i currently have .070 spacers under the 
cylinders, giving me a CR of 7:1, but a deck of .13" or thereabouts. 
i do have some .040 spacers (which reduce deck but bring CR to 
7.3:1).  i'm curious to see which number i should worry about!

the folllowing books were consulted while building the motor:

souping the vw - clymer
making the vw go - elfrink
the sports car engine - campbell
scientific design of intake and exhaust systems - smith
design and tuning of competition engines - smith
without guesswork
berg tech articles
berg instructions
vw performance tuning - clymer
how to rebuild vw - wilson
how to hotrod vw engines - fisher
various chilton, clymer, bentley, scientific publications, elfrink, 
vw  and other shop manuals
back issues of DB&HVW and VWT from the late 60s/early 70s that 
actually knew what they were talking about :)  david mayes now has 
these; hope they helped on that okrasa.
the net
and several listees.

very few made any mention about deck beyond having TOO LITTLE. 
looking for more, and for you folks to chime in.
