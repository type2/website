Ronnie told me he uses stock muffler on 1800 with no problem. I bought
a $20 glass pack at Kragen to install on the header for my type 4.

 Any thoughts from anyone else on using a stock muffler on a 1776 engine?
 Sounds like it may be a bit too small. I tend to run a little fast on the
 highways. Don't want too much back pressure. The point of all this is that I
 want something a good deal quieter and keep the header look.  What about a
 toyota or or other muffler from about a 1800 to 2000cc engine? I already
 went to a muffler shop and they said they could not fit any of their
 mufflers onto the headers. Something about the mufflers being too wide and
 too tall. Length did not seem to be so much an issue.  Maybe I just need to
 try another shop??
