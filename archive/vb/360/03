From Kevin Guarnotta:

 I've seen the site that shows the break down point of the oils, but is there
one that indicates the breakdown point of the polymers? Or is this
top-secret stuff?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yeah.... in my 1st post to this thread I said there is a site called Lubrication Notes from Redline that used
to be up and free but you now need a subscription and password from the Triumph Registry to get to it.
http://www.vtr.org/maintain/lubricants-redline.html

In it, the oil expert states that the plastic polymers breakdown at 212 degrees F [or 100C].

According to other websites, as of around 2002, better [read more expensive] polymers are out there that will
stay together at higher temps. But you don't know which brands are using them. The price you pay for name
brands does not indicate if they are using them. Some of the highest priced oil still use the cheapest
polymers.

If you do a search on 'multi grade oils', you will see that all of them do the viscosity tests on the top end
of temps at 99 or 100 degrees C.  That is a reason for this.......

Websites come and go like rain.....  the good ones seem to disappear fast. Everytime a FART comes up, the
previous links in the old discussion are dead. Here is one that I finally tracked down again after 3 sites
carrying disappeared: http://www.micapeak.com/info/oiled.html
Too bad he does not mention the temp at which polymers breakdown. But he does mention 100C.

Oil is like a slot machine in Vegas. You put your money in and hope you have a winner.
Everybody has their own opinion on which oil is the best, gathered from their fathers, advertising BS, shade
tree mechanics, etc. Best thing you and everyone else out there can do is read and do research. Me? I use
Valvoline 30W in the winter and Valvoline 40W in the summer here in Fresno, Calif.  A lot of people swear by
Castrol. I swear at Castrol! They are liars.....
The info is out there.
