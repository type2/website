yup. s'poseta have more torque, let a little bit more air in for the 
slightly-larger-than-stock cyls.
don't think yer full of it - i just want to hear what you do to get 
those numbers and figures. i like knowing the reasons why, that's all.

if i had the $$$, i might consider enlarging the chambers - but i 
don't, so i am looking for the best compromise. i'm also willing to 
experiment; i know i had adequate performance at 6.9:1 and no 
overheating till the outside temp went above 100 (ok, so that's 4 
months here in phx), but i MIGHT try the 7.3:1 just for kicks.
