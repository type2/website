Subject: AAA in NC/SC was New Double Cab/Tow Truck Horror Story 

From: "B R M" <jezzina(-at-)ctc.net>

Over here (Carolinas) AAA wants you to sign a waiver that says they are not
responsible for and damage that might happen. They act like you absolutely
must sign it to get towed.
________________________
That must be a NC thing because I live in SC and I have been towed many
times over the last few years all by AAA with my AAA+ membership.  I have
never signed anything until the tow was over.  And that was just so the tow
truck driver could get paid. No waiver of responsibility ever as I would not
sign it.  IF the tow truck driver agrees to tow your bus they are
responsible.  If they are not responsible for it, my bus is not going on
their truck.

Peace,
