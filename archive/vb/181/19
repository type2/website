Subject: Re: [VB] Shipping a double cab tilt

I shipped one to Santa Barbara one time via FedEx.  I ZipTied them together,
and wrapped cardboard around them.   They got a little tweaked at the end, ie
bent together, but not too bad.  As a matter of fact, I was just playing with
them a few minutes ago on my new double cab.
