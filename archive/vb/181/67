I don't like the drain plug senders, both from an accuracy and hassle
standpoint.

You could put a sensor in the oil gallery behind
the pressure switch.  This requires a sender that extends almost to the
bottom of the tapped hole as well as a Tee to hook up the switch.  This
would give you the temperature of the oil that is actually going to the
bearings.

Second choice is a dipstick sender.  This would put the sender in nearly
the hottest oil.  Unfortunately, this makes checking the oil a pain.

If you have a "universal" case with they Type 3 oil fill opening, you can
put the sensor in the blockoff plate.  This is also in the "hot corner" of
the sump.  If you lack the blockoff, you might be able to drill and tap
the case for the sensor, but I have no idea of how thick the case material
is at that location.  I'd want to practice on a junk case first!  Keep the
sensor as low in the sump as possible, as you want to measure the
temperature of the oil, not the gases within the case.

The third choice would be the "cleanest" installation, but also the most
difficult if you don't have a universal case.
