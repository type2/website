Subject: Re: [VB] New Double Cab/Tow Truck Horror Story

Within the past week, I have been towed twice by AAA(don't ask), and the
only waiver I've had to sign was saying that they wouldn't take any
responsibility if the car was damaged while it was sitting at my friend's
shop(they say it's in a bad neighborhood).  Nothing mentioned about the tow.
Maybe I'm just lucky and they forgot about it or something like that.
