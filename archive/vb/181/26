Subject: Rear Engine Door Seal Question

Just bought a rear engine dooe lid seal for my 60 Kombi.  I got it from 
Wolfsburg West.  The one that came off my van was tow piece.  One piece went 
along the top and down the tow vertical sides, and the bottom piece.  The new 
ones if 4 pieces and doesn't seem as wide as the originals.  The old one fit 
tight in the channel, the new one seems real loose and doesn't engage the 
lip.  Has any one installed one of these new seals?  Do you need adhesive to 
attach it?  The old one did not.

Thanks
