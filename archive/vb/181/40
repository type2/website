Subject: wiper motor re-grease

was writ:
"If your wipers don't move relatively quickly, it might be a good time
to pull the wiper motor, clean the old grease out of the gearbox and
repack, and check the brushes and commutator.  The spec for your
wiper motor is 44 strokes a minute (one stroke is the wiper blade
moving across the window and back).  I worked over my wiper motor
a couple of months ago and sped it up considerably - the grease was
old and hard, and the oil was separating from the grease and running
down the shaft to foul the commutator."

where did you get the spec for the motor? does this apply to all split
windows? mine is a '65, still 6volt.

how involved/difficult is it to clean/regrease the wipre motor? any special
tools needed? or just screwdrivers/wrenches...the reason i ask is mine did
not want to move at all last night-it was groaing away...i think it was
either due to the fact that i had not used them in a while(over a month) but
more likely the cold weather-it was as if the grease for the gears had
gotten too thick...
