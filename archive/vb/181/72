Good point.  The pressure would rise until the relief valve opened in the
case.  The passages could take that pressure, but a thin oil filter can
may well distort.  If the oil filter gasket is 2-1/2 inches in diameter
and the pressure is 70PSI, the force on the face of the filter would be
350 pounds which could distort the sealing surface and dislodge the
gasket.
