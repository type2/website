Karl,

Just in case you ever wondered why library science is a masters degree...
Searching is *not* easy! He does not have a site, he has an ad at
thesamba.com. To save you the half hour I spend searching, the direct URL
for his ad is:

http://www.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/index.mv?photo+200206071833207977

I went to "classifieds" then to "search", then specified "rack" in Find
Text and "Type 2/Bus - 1968-up - Parts - For Sale" in Sections and his ad
for "vw BUS rOoF-RaCk,New!" popped right up!  After only 20 minutes of
searching different options!  With his talent for use of the shift key, I
wonder if he does WaReZ as well?

The rack does look nice.  I'd want one if (a) I ever got another passenger
bus or (b) I did not already own one :-)

I would love to conduct my standard "strength test" on his racks, tho...
When I got mine, I did not have (and still don't have) a bus to put under
it (for some reason, I keep getting these Westies with the poptop), so I
leaned it against the fence with the legs sticking out and stacked ~500
lbs. of lumber, distributed, on the three sets of legs.  The VW rack held
it just fine.  Wonder how the repop would do? :-)
