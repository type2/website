In the later editions of Idiot manual, there is another chapter in the
back, "Hi-Performance Modifications" by Colin Messer.  His first words
of wisdom on the subject of Oil are, "Asking people what kind of oil
they use is like asking what beer they drink."  I personally think that
statement explains a lot.
