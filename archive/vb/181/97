Subject: Distirbutor issues...  Vroooomm!!!

Hello fellow Volk-a-maniacs,

After two Fridays of fiddling and taking your advice, over and over again, I
am happy to say, the old girl on the road again!  Thank you all for your hints
and assistance.

However, after finding the 'sweet' spot, swapping out the condenser, rotor,
cap and points (just to make sure were starting with new parts) we got the
engine to fire on Friday afternoon.  Yippy!  Vroom, sputter, choke... dead.
Every time we got it to fire up, it would rev high, sputter and die.  Awe
crap... new problem.  We then fiddled with it in every capacity that we could
think of.  We finally called up a helpful soul at a local VW yard (with handy
store front part distribution center).  He indicated a few tricks that we
tried, but to no avail.  He offered his traveling services and mid-Sunday
afternoon, we took him up on it.  He drove out and sat for about 5 minutes.
Pointing out a few things that could be better (damned franken-engine PO
builder).

To the root of the issue:  It all boiled down to a lost part.  It appears that
our franken-engine has a tube coming out the side bottom of where the
carburetor attaches (forgot the name...).  Our 'helper' indicated that this is
not how things should be  Apparently, when the first big KAAABLEEEWYYY
backfire happened, it blew off the little stopper that was on this tube and
the carb wasn't able to suck the gas the way it should.  A piece of spare
rubber tube and a bolt to stop up the other end and VROOOMMM!!!!  Around the
block we drove and it sounded as good as ever, but ever more sweet after all
this effort.

Long story short:  Get to know someone that can look at an engine for 5
minutes and be able to debug the 'obvious' stuff.

Thanks again for all you help.  See you in traffic.
Greg & Dan
