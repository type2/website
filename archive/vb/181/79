The spec is in the Bentley.  They used the same motor from about 1958
to about 1964.  On that style, the motor is a squarish thing sitting
right in back of the gearbox.  On the later style, the motor is round
and it sits off to the right of the gearbox.

Just screwdrivers and wrenches.  Be careful of the small parts.  One
of the gear shafts has a plastic bearing at one end that's part of the
sheet metal cover and stays with the cover.  The other end has a tiny
thrust washer (maybe 2mm diameter) that's easy to miss.  One of the
gears in mine was fiber.  Don't dunk a fiber gear in a carb bucket
overnight, but a spritz of cleaner is OK.  I used high-temperature
wheel bearing grease in mine.

If yours is like my '64, the motor side has a metal cover with a wire
bail holding it on, like a valve cover.  Pop that cover off and eyeball
the workings of the motor - make sure there isn't oil or grease all over
the brushes.
