Subject: 42 yrs w/o back-up lights and 4-way flashers, and not even a

Split Nosers,

  Finally got the time get the Side-Loader a little more Street Legal.  It
is a strange feeling not having another car to drive, especially with
the short cold autumn days already here in NJ.
 
  It is just a miracle that this SC has not got its' butt kicked by not
having back-up lights or flashers for the past 42 yrs.  I really have a
hard time backing up at night with the tilt on, the see-through plastic
just acts like a one way mirror and I'm on the reflective side.  Getting
out and looking is just not something your going to do by yourself (but I
have asked my passenger to give me voice signals!), especially in
neighborhoods like Trenton, Camden or Newark.  I'd rather drive my VW's in
the insane circle at the Arc de Triumph then on the Belt Parkway in
Brooklyn.  It is nice driving down the Deleware River on either side
though, especially with the leaves turning now.

  For the back-up lights, Ronnie sent me some beetle chrome ones that I
put under the rails on the back bumper and I used a 67 back dome light
swith to turn them on.  Works great!  What a difference in stress level.

  For the 4-way flashers I used the 9 pin dammit box and spliced the front
turn signal to VL and VR.  For the switch, I used a wiper switch.  Again,
it probably was a good thing for safety.

  Soon, I'll be at NJDMV and shedding the historic plates.  I sure wish I
had a good looking girl to hold my hand while I await the results - I get
apprehensive when I let DMV workers get in my VW's, and put it on the
Parsons Tech treadmill, and slap the big red rejected sticker on the
windscreen.  I'll just got to deal with it alone.

Best,
joe
