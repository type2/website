Like hell!  The DC, which was being pulled backwards and on dollies,
'rear-ended' the tow truck, smashing the rear corners in badly, and even
tweaking the bed downwards slightly.  It even bent the seam forward of
the rear vents.

 Any ideas how I should proceed with the tow stuck company?  AAA?

Background: Have a ghia that had been in an accident. Fender was crushed in
but bumper was untouched because it was lowered so it didnt get hit. Months
later It had an engine fire on the freeway due to a POS chrome clear fuel
filter. I called AAA and this is what happened.

I had the ghia towed by AAA and it fell off the tow truck dolly when he took
off at a left green turn arrow. It rolled across the intersection and
slammed into a high curb on the other side trashing the perfect front
bumper. The guy was apoligizing and made a bunch of calls, then asked if i
had been planning to re-chrome the bumper. I said yes and then he said ok
well ill give you half the price of the chroming which is $250 "since you
were gonna do it anyway". I said bullshit and got mad and then he started
saying how he was gonna tell his boss that it was already bent when he
picked up (refering to the crushed fender)...realizing I was loosing ground
quick I said ok and let him go right there. The money he gave me ended up
paying to replace all the burnt plastic parts in the engine compartment.
Didn't the driver offer to pay you? What did you say to him? I guess if you
let him go, next step is to file a claim with AAA. Id get some previous pics
from the PO if possible.
