Subject: Re: [VB] high pressure/Oil filter/cold issues

I forget the brand, not Mann though.  hear those are great filters.  But hey 
Ronnie, when was the last time you started your bus at under 20*F?  I think 
Havasu is about the warmest place in the country.  

know how high oil pressure is too high?   The other thing is the bus had 
started making this 'woo woo woo' noise since I got back from California in 
September .  I thought it was the tranny, and was cussing cause it was a Todd 
Hill rebuild with 25K on it and I was thinking tranny bearings gone bad.  But 
last night went out (after switching to thinner oil) and the woo woo woo 
noise was gone.  Coincidence? I'm now thinking it might have been an internal 
engine noise from insufficient lubing from too thick/high pressure oil.  I 
don't drive that far each day, so I don't have that many miles on it since 
the noise started, but eek.

This summer I stayed with 30wt.  Usually I switch to thicker oil in summer.  
Guess with this high power pump I just have to run thinner oil all around.

<< What brand filter and number are you using. I use a MANN W 719/5 and have
 never blown a filter or had one leak. Excellent internal by pass. This is
 the same filter used on hydraulic engines (over 90 lbs pressure with 30
 weight in warm weather). I have comparred to the WIX premium and NAPA gold
 and they don't even compare internally and the Mahle I have seen are made in
 Brazil and seem a little cheesy.
