To date, I have never found anything that replaces smooth surfaces and a
fresh gasket. Working in the aircraft industry for 27 years, putting some
sort of "goo" in place of a tight fit and the proper gasket is just not
done. I found that some sort of repair can be made on a temporary bases and
would probably be OK for a car where you can conk out along side of the
road, but when I put a carb on a hovercraft it's kind of difficult to have
AAA come out and tow you home. Do it right the first time and forget about
it.

Is there any kind of goo that can be put on the gasket or used in place
of the gasket to fix this?  Or is it too difficult to get a layer of
goo that will seal without also being too thick?  Also, the sealant
would mean that you would probably trash the gasket if you took it
apart, which might cause problems for roadside fixing.  I'm pretty sure
that the stock Solex air horn gaskets go on dry.

On my Solex/Bocar 30 PICT 1, there was some stuff sticking up but it
was all removable - accelerator pump discharge tube, a little brass
jet with a check ball under it, etc.
