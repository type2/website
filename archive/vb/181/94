Looking at it again, the chart you're looking at may be newer info.
Note the change bar on the left side dated 8/66.  The chart on S-2 9
has no date, which to me implies that it's earlier.

Both charts give Workshop Bulletin numbers up to S-5 for engine oil
specifications.  However, only S-6 through S-11 (gear oil and greases)
are reproduced in the '63-'67 Bentley.

In the '50-'62 Bentley, S-1 through S-5 are also reproduced.  The notes
on S-1 and S-2 say to use 10 W in the engine from October to March and
20 W 20 in the engine from April to September.

The '50-'62 Bentley also has recommended oil charts on S-2 9 and S-2 13.
These charts should only deal with 36 and 40 hp engines, and both charts
list 10 W, 20 W 20, 30, and 5 W oil for the same temperature ranges.  In
addition, the chart on S-2 9 has 10 W 30 for "All the year round".

A quick cruise through the '69 Without Guesswork doesn't seem to show
any oil viscosity recommendations, just refill capacities.

The chart in http://www.atis.net/oil_faq.html only lists multi-viscosity
oils.  Comparing Workshop Bulletin S-4 (10 W 30) with the Oil FAQ chart
is somewhat interesting.  Chevron Supreme, Exxon Superflo Hi-Perf, Exxon
Superflo Supreme, Kendall GT-1, Pennzoil PLZ Turbo, Quaker State, Shell
Fire and Ice, Shell Super 2000, Shell Truck Guard, Spectro Golden M.G.,
Valvoline All Climate, Valvoline Turbo, and Valvoline Race all fail the
"flash point > 210 C" requirement.  Havoline Formula 3, Kendall GT-1,
Pennzoil PLZ Turbo, Shell Super 2000, Shell Truck Guard, Valvoline All
Climate, Valvoline Race, and Valvoline Synthetic all fail the "ash < 1.0%"
requirement.

S-4 specifies viscosity in Engler degrees.  There are conversion charts
in the Bosch handbook for Engler degrees to mm**2/sec, and a chart
listing the mm**2/sec values for various SAE grades.  VW specifies
viscosity > 1.80 E at 100 C, which corresponds to about 9.5 mm**2/sec.
The SAE viscosity chart (SAE J300, March 1993) gives limits for 30 weight
oil at 100 C from 9.3-12.5 mm**2/sec.  This implies that most 30 weight
oils (or multi-viscosity oils with a 30 weight rating) should meet the
VW specification.  This can't directly be compared to the Oil FAQ chart,
as it lists viscosity index VI, which is a measure of the rate of change
of viscosity and not absolute viscosity.

The oils which seem to meet the VW specification for 10 W 30 for flash
point and ash are Amsoil, Castrol GTX, and Unocal Super.  Mobil 1 and
Red Line both meet the flash point requirement but do not give numbers
for ash.  Keep in mind that the specifications in the Oil FAQ are not
newer than about 1995, while the VW specification is from October 1961.
Some of the oils in the Oil FAQ may have been reformulated; some may
now meet the VW specification better and others may not now meet it.
