That's why it's important to make sure your engine is not running hot.
Believe it or not, the new modern fancy pants cars that are coming out now,
run higher oil temps than we do!  Unless we are running too hot, we do not
need to worry about the oil breaking down like that.

What oil temps are you hitting in the summer time?  A thinner oil will
actually lower your oil temps by putting more oil through the oil cooler
before it hits the bearings.

I haven't seen 5w oil anywhere, and am sure it has not been avaliable for a
long, long time.  5w and 5w30 are not the same.  5w oil is what VW is
talking about with that TSB.

I know a lot of bus folk don't run the Berg dipstick because it comes on all
the time, and has been called a 'worry light'.  I think these people are
looking at it the wrong way.  When I first put my engine in my bus, my light
came on after 7-10 miles on the freeway (summer time).  Instead of pulling
the dipstick out, and being done with it, I worked on the engine and it's
cooling system until I could drive on the freeway as long as I wanted,
without tripping the light on.  If your engine does run hot enough to trip
the berg stick on, then you probably don't want to run a multi-grade oil.
But that doesn't fix the problem, ya know.
