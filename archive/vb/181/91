Maybe it has something to do with him not working for an oil company, like
the guy at the link you gave does.  :)

Hackett's "Oil FAQ" has an email address at the University of Nevada.
Even if that is no good, you might be able to write the University, get
a current address, and ask him directly.  On the other hand, maybe he
got too many flames about his FAQ, sold his computer, and started living
in a cave near the Grand Canyon.  In that case, I know we have listees
in Arizona and Nevada - maybe one of them could find him and ask him.  :)
