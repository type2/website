Serious question - when you have a bolt or screw chromed, do they just
do the head or do they try to do the whole thing?  How about nuts?  Does
the chrome plating on the threads change the diameter enough to make them
difficult to install, or is there enough tolerance that the chrome doesn't
bother it?  Just curious about this.
