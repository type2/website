118 rusty little fasteners from an old VW, he shook his head and gave me my

bills if I ever started to bug my friends for these parts again<

Actually I had heard at one time, that you could insure your package for a
million dollars, but you still have to prove that your items are worth that
much if they are lost and technically over stating the value on the tag is
an offense. I had to send someone cash one time (guy overseas selling piles
of NOS barndoor taillights, insisted on cash), i tried to insure the package
for the price of the money when i sent it....Knowing that the PO wont insure
cash, i told them it was some "valuable   documents"...the lady asked what
kind of documents and i told her I couldnt talk about it (didnt have a lie
made up that far), she just looked at me and said "well we dont insure paper
of any kind" heh. Anyway i noticed on the samba "my dad's better then your
dad" rant forums, that they are relaying stories back and forth about trying
to get UPS and the postoffice to pay for stuff that gets broken or lost if
your interested...doesnt sound too promising.
