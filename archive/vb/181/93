so called AAA. This thing was LOW. The muffler was under the bumper and I
could hardly fit my hand between the muffler and the ground. Guy shows up in
a flat bed as requested, looks at the bus and starts looking around the drag
strip grounds for scrap wood, rocks etc to get the thing on the truck.
Didn't scrape once, and he never bitched! I couldn't believe it.
When I mentioned how much I appreciated it  he replied that a big hispanic
guy taught him to do that when he jerked his low rider up on the truck and
damaged his ground effects.
