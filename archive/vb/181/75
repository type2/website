Subject: VW TOOLS   

    I have just spent the better part of a day sorting through parts and
other stuff. 1 of the reasons was I wanted to find some of my old dealer
accessory and tool manuals/books. 
   Well I did find 1 box of books and found some of the manuals and the main
one I was looing for is the ZELANDA tools for Volkswagen book.
   This must have been the tool book issued to the dealers as there are
letters added into it from VWoA telling the dealers that they HAVE to
purchase these tools and the minimum requirement of what they have to get.
It also has service bullintens on how to modify tools for use on newer VW's.
It covers all type 1,2 3 and 4's
  VW tools numbers from VW102 to VW804 and all supplements also US tool
numbers1002 to over 8000 but with a lot of numbers missing in the middle
(must be the none VW tools deleted)
   There are also pictures of all tools listed.

I knew I had this book somewhere and just think I tried to sell it on e-bay
and a few swaps a few years back and couldn't get 25 dollars for it (not for
sale now)
