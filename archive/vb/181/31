Subject: Re: [VB] Transmission Gearing

I have a 1600 DP in my 67 Westy. 205/70 14 tires Stock gears with reduction 
boxes. I have an extractor exhaust with factory heater boxes, and electronic 
ignition.
I can see 80 mph indicated to keep up with San Diego Freeway traffic at 
4,300-4,500 on my tach. This is at 1/2 throttle cruise. It will rev higher 
but over 4,700 scares me for engine life. I use Redline 20/50 oil at 3k 
changes.
I do have disc brakes on the front.
I would like to do an IRS conversion with some gearing changes to reduce 80 
mph  from 4,300 to about 3,800
