Using an IR thermometer, I find that the hottest place in the sump is the
right rear corner.  ----------- Correct, its oil that has bypassed the
cooler and oil filter because it is surplus volume or returned because it
is at high pressure Too much for the cooler, so when your engine is ice
cold a lot of oil bypasses.
-----------------------------
This seems logical, since any oil that comes out of the pressure control
valve (the front one) would dump cooled oil to the sump in the front left
corner which would be cooler than oil that has gone
through the working parts of the engine. ----------- The pressure relief
valve sends oil to the cooler and filter then after that trip it goes to
the bearings. The oil temp in the pan is or should be hotter than what is
goung to your bearings.
See the map in Tom Wilsons Book.
