If you switch to a 3.88 r&p staying with bus 1st through 4th you get 3,000rpm 
at 60mph, and 2mph for every 100rpm in 4th (.82 / bus 4th), so 70 would be 
3500, and 80 at 4K.   This is fairly straightforward in terms of 
installation, as the tranny goes in exactly the way it does now- 
You may want to switch to 205/75/14 tires, as they are taller than the 
205/70/14s, so that is an easy way to bring rpms down as you increase road 
speed, but it won't affect the speedo.  I mean what you do at speedo reading 
70 would be faster than it is now at speedo reading 70.

Wondering why you choose 4700 rpms as your feeling good cut off engine rpm?

 I can see 80 mph indicated to keep up with San Diego Freeway traffic at 
 4,300-4,500 on my tach. This is at 1/2 throttle cruise. It will rev higher 
 but over 4,700 scares me for engine life. I use Redline 20/50 oil at 3k 
 changes.
 I do have disc brakes on the front.
 I would like to do an IRS conversion with some gearing changes to reduce 80 
 mph  from 4,300 to about 3,800
