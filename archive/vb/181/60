Hi Kevin,
Agreed!!!  Eric took a look at one of those new at a local shop and it was so 
slopply make we would not use it for anything more than an ash tray, and 
since we do not smoke it is worse than useless!  We have checked out and 
installed the CB oil filter/pump and is has been excellant, except for the 
fact one has to modify it or the stock muffler so the filter does not fit in 
the same space as the left side heat riser tube coming out of the front of 
the muffler.
