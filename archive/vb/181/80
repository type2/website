Keep the faith!  Get a hand crank, crank start apron and pulley nut.

12 V is a slippery slope.  At first you do it because you want your engine
to turn over better.  Then, you notice you can install a big sound system.
Oops - stereo might get stolen - better add a car alarm.  Of course with
12 V you can plug your cell phone and laptop into the Bus so you can work
wherever you go.  Near the end, you start installing neon tubes and LED
tailpipe tips.  Finally, your alternator blows up and you decide to take
the final step and trade off the Bus for a D-dg- C-r-v-n.  So stay with
6 V.  :)
