Thanks George.

So do you have a recommendation of the best location for the oil temp
sensor?  I believe that's where we started with this.  I'm about to use
the drain plug sensor.

Hmmm, would a relief valve sender actually put the temperature sensor in
the flow of oil?  I'm a little fuzzy on the construction of the relief
valve, but doesn't the oil enter and exit on the opposite side of the
plunger from the screw-in plug?  Unless the sensor extends though the
plunger, it won't see much fresh oil, particularly when the oil is hot
and the relief valve plunger is closed.

The reasion I ask this is that the drain plug is one of the colder
places
I've found on my engine.  My theory is that there is a stagnent area
directly above the drain plug which insulates heat flow.  the oil in the
passages should be hotter than the oil just above the drain plug, since
this oil is the oil in rapid circulation that has just returned from the
hot places in the engine.

Using an IR thermometer, I find that the hottest place in the sump is
the
right rear corner.  This seems logical, since any oil that comes out of
the pressure control valve (the front one) would dump cooled oil to the
sump in the front left corner which would be cooler than oil that has
gone
through the working parts of the engine.
