A friend has sent cash on a few occasions and has had it go missing both
times.  People are looking for cash in the mail.  Don't send cash unless
there is no other way...then disguise it, roll it up in a tube, fold it
up in a square and wrap it in brown paper.  Don't just throw it in an envelope!

Common sense, but then again....
