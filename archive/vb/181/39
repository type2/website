Subject: re:cold issues

just a short note on cold weather running with straight 30. I used castrol
straight 30 in my engine-until it gets chilly, i think if you check either
the bottle or their website it says to only use the straight 30 wt oil down
to 40 degrees fahrenheit.

i just changed my oil over to 10W-30 for the winter, but i may even go
thinner-as it didn't want to turn over too easily for me yesterday in the
cold....after all my struggles with the 6v system, i am starting to bend a
little in the direction of 12V.
