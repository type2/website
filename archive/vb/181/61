So are your 82.3 flat or domed? I got the 82 domed Mahle in the stash of
EMPI stuff a couple months back.

The *ticket* in the mid 60's for the 40hp were an 82mm piston... I have a
set of NOS empi/Mahle pistons (82.3) and a used set of 82s as well.  I'd
have to open up the boxes to see how tall they were.  I also have a set of
92mm pistons with 40hp pins... these were deano/npr units.  In the catalogs,
all the 82mm pistons are shown with flat tops.  Also, they offered an
82.25mm oversized piston for rebuilds as well.

Ronnie asked:
  I am getting parts together to start to build a 40 HP big bore for my 15
window and have a question on P/L. I have 2 different sets of 82.5 mm p/l. 1
set is Mahle and have domed topped pistons and the other set are CIMA with
flat top. Were are Mahle domed or are these something different. The MAHLE
are also 1.3 mm taller  then the CIMA when measured from the wrist pins. The
base are the same measurement. So question number 2 is was there a high
compression set made?
