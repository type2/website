Subject: RE: [VB] Re: Baby Dellorto Carb's

I had a pair on a 1776 with the conical dunce cap cloth filters. They worked
great after I got them balanced, for about a year. As with most of the
single choke Dells and Solex carbs I've had, they suffer from the same
thing, vacuum leak at the float bowl. This occurs after a year or more when
the float bowl gasket starts drying out and becoming hard. While yet soft,
the gasket fills the imperfections. The Solex carbs are not to bad to
rework, there isn't anything sticking up around the mating surfaces. The
Dells I had had a little brass air tube going from the bowl portion to the
cap. Makes it hard to wet sand the surfaces for a close fit. Don't even ask
me to do a Weber. There are crazy masochists out there already that will do
them!

	I have a question about 34 baby Dellorto carbs. Is anyone on the
list running them? And how are they adjusted? I have an idle set screw
and looks to be fuel mixture screw on the right side low on the carb but
that's it.



Thanks for Any Info,
