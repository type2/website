Subject: RE: [VB] New Double Cab/Tow Truck Horror Story

I worked for many years dispatching tow trucks for AAA.  We NEVER told
anyone to sign a waiver.  AAA only contracts through licensed and bonded
companies.  During the years of my employment with AAA I cannot recall
any problems like the ones mentioned in this thread.  We did have many
problems with the locksmith service.  The locksmiths will on occasion
require a waiver since there is sometimes a very good chance that damage
will occur in getting a vehicle open.  We had a lot of people insist on
getting flatbeds.  For classic cars we usual accommodated the request.
Some people, specially punk kids with low riders, think they "have to
have a flatbed".  Truth be know, a flatbed is not the best thing for a
low rider since the angle of the bed is too great.  Sure you can pile
wood to lessen the angle, but most tow truck flatbeds don't carry that
kind of stuff around.  We had several books for each auto manufacture
that described the best ways to tow their vehicles.  Very few list a
flatbed as the only way they can be towed.  The few times recently that
I have had my DC towed I have requested a flatbed (USAA not AAA).  I
guess I'm no different than those punk a$$ kids :-)

 When ever I get a bus towed I insist on a flatbed only! I have and will
never alow a bus to be towed by a hook or wheel lift. You do have the
option and need to insist on it. Even in our middle of nowhere city,
most tow companies have at least 1 flatbed.
