Most likely.  Stock, the high/low beam switching was done by pulling
the turn signal lever towards you.  There is a contact in the turn
signal switch that activates a relay under the dash to switch from
low to high and back.  If you look at
http://www.vintagebus.com/wiring/bus-66-usa.jpg , the two brown wires
connected to 31 and S on the turn signal switch go to the contact and
J7 is the relay.

Also, per that diagram, your Bus would have originally been equipped
with the "9-prong box" for the turn signal flasher and hazard function.
This box may or may not still be in the Bus.  For lots of information
on this setup, see http://www.type2.com/library/electris/vw-9prong.html .

It depends.  How many switches are there on the left side of your
speedometer housing?  Stock, there is one small tumbler switch there
that is supposed to turn on the rear dome light.  If you only have one
switch, the PO probably just unhooked the dome light and connected the
dimmer relay wire to that switch.  If there are two switches, then one
has been added on.
