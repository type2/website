Subject: 40 hp big bore ?

  I am getting parts together to start to build a 40 HP big bore for my 15
window and have a question on P/L. I have 2 different sets of 82.5 mm p/l. 1
set is Mahle and have domed topped pistons and the other set are CIMA with
flat top. Were are Mahle domed or are these something different. The MAHLE
are also 1.3 mm taller  then the CIMA when measured from the wrist pins. The
base are the same measurement. So question number 2 is was there a high
compression set made? 
  All you vintage performance guys I hope will have the answer. David?
