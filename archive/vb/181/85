Subject: Turn signal switch for my 67

I am in need of an original turn signal switch for my 1967 deluxe.  The
PO really messed up the wiring all over but especially in regards to the
turn signal switch and circuit.  For now there is a generic turn signal
switch that does not work and has this annoying bright red light on it.
I looked at the busdepot and rocky mountain motorworks with no luck, and
posted a parts needed ad on thesamba, but I also thought I would ask on
here as well.  I appreciate any assistance that could be forthcoming
either information or an offer to sell me one.
