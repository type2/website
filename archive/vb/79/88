Subject: they're back Westy Racks

   After a few month hiatus the REPO Westy racks are back. These are great
copies for the budget minded person who wants a Westy rack. From 10 feet you
can't tell the difference. 
   They are in the port and should be delivered by the end of next week.
   25 dollar discount on all orders I recieve in the next week.
   There were 140 imported, last time there were 40 and sold out in a week,
these should last a little longer.
