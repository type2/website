Subject: Re: [VB] HELP!!!!!! VW person needs help...

Meredith,

Times like this it's great to be able to fall back on the VW community for 
help.  I know a few people over there and im sure a few list members may be 
able to help.  I will get you in contact with a few.  If you need anything 
else feel free to let me know.

As is the same for all other list members that travel through the Phoenix 
area, my home and messy garage is always open.

The 57 15 window is soon to stand upon its own 4 legs.  There are a few small 
parts needed here and there but they can wait.  I need to DRIVE A VW!!!!  Its 
killing me driving around in a "domestic" car.  Last items i need are a rear 
bumper, rear long interior panel in caramel and bearings for the front drums. 
 If anyone has some interior parts, let me know!!  I'll post a few pictures 
tomorrow.
