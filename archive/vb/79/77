Subject: Good place to order parts.

  Recently I ordered some parts from busdepot.com. It was terrible. They 
sent the wrong stuff(actually screwed up the order so bad it was pathetic) 
and weren't the most coperative with me trying to straighten out the order 
and get what I needed. I need a place that will take care of me and send the 
correct parts out quickly. Don't mind paying the price it takes.
Thanks
John
