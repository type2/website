have to jump in here - tho i have bought from bus depot (and been happy),
wolfsberg west (ditto), aircooled.net (same), wcm (eh), wolfgang (good),
jim thompson back in the day and others, i gotta give props to a guy i HAVE
NOT bought from    :)

poor ronnie  oldvolks has had to deal with me several times on email and
phone where either a) i end up not getting the part i was contemplating -
usually due to funds that evaporate between yesterday and today :P -   or
b) he doesn't have it, and recommends another dealer who DOES.

he still responds quickly to queries, even tho i have to be labelled
'tire-kicker supreme' in his file!

and THAT, folks, is truly the mark of a good businessman. he'd LOVE to take
your money, but he honestly wants to see your bus on the road, however it
gets there......





now don't go making his bizness so 'successful' that his service drops to
pot and we start seeing ronnie-bashing   ;)
