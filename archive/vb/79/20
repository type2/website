The "classic" way to clean out a rusty fuel tank is to throw a couple
of handfuls of clean gravel or some nuts+bolts in it and shake the
tank around to break up the rust and junk.  Make sure you get all the
rocks/hardware out before putting the tank back in service.  You can
also have it boiled out at a radiator shop, but plan on re-painting
the outside of the tank after this.  The paint may still be on the
outside but it will be sticky and goopy.

Either way, drain the old gas into a gas jug and take out the filter
screen on the outlet pipe first.  You might be able to use the old gas
in the lawnmower but it probably won't work.  _Don't_ try to burn it in
a car.  I tried to use up some old gas I drained out of my Dad's Bug in
my fuel injected Ch*vy by cutting it 10 to 1 with fresh gas, but the old
gas made the Ch*vy run funky until it was all gone.  If you don't know
what else to do with the old gas, call your local recycling agency 
(if you have one) or fire department (non-emergency!) for guidance.

Good luck!
