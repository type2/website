Subject: RE: [VB] Electric fuel pump

Why do I want an electric pump?  Well about 5 years ago I took the leftover
engine that I rebuilt for my old squareback and converted it to upright to
go into my Thing.  I got all the fuel pump parts from Gene Berg Ent.  The
first day I drove the Thing out on a treffen around Palo Alto the tip of the
pump rod either wore away or snapped off.  The pump rod was junk, I had it
tested and the rod was dead soft.  At that time I had had it with poor
quality parts and decided to go with an electric pump.  I purchased two and
added one to my Thing, using rubber mounts.  Five years later I have had no
problems and the Thing always passes smog with flying colors.  I am now
swapping the engine from the Thing into the bus and since the engine is set
up to use the electric pump I would just a soon use the extra pump I have.
I also picked up a small shut off valve from the hardware store.  I'm not
sure if it will like the gas but I will keep very close tabs on that.  Also
I would rather not mount the pump in the engine compartment but couldn't
find a suitable location.  If anyone has a better solution for mounting the
electric pump or a fuel cut off valve that I could place in the engine
compartment I would appreciate the feedback.
