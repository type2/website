Subject: I had to take the engine out (Neophyte update)

First, Thanks to all who helped.

Yes the shift coupler was good and still wired into place.
All four bolts were in holding the engine in place and the tranny mounts
were all good and tight except for one broken bolt.

I removed the engine and found that two out of 3 of the springs had come off
of their clips. Looked at the surface of the throw-out bearing and looks
shiny and not scarred as well as the face that the previously mention
bearing mates with on the pressure plate(?). Also found a broken bolt on the
right rear tranny mount.

so the new question is would that broken bolt be the root of the problem.
would that have created enough movement to cause this to happen.

Am going to put together tommorrow after check tranny level(when I can see
better)
and replacing broken bolt.

Gary
