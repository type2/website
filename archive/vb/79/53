before you put the engine back in,have someone help
you check the tranny. by turning the input shaft by
hand(you can use the clutch disk as added leverage)
check to see that the wheel turns in all gears(you
will need to have someone hold one wheel stationary or
nothing will happen since it is an "open differential"
this should help determine  if it is a clutch problem
or in the transaxle itself..
