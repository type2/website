Subject: EveryBus 2002 - East Coast VW bus event

EveryBus 2002 is just a little more than two months away. If you 
leave on the east side of the continental divide than you may want to 
seriously consider attending. Last years event brought over 120 VW 
Transporters to one location for a weekend of fun. This year is 
shaping up to be bigger and better.. Already folks from New England. 
Minnesota, Canada, Florida and all points between are gearing up for 
EB02.


ALL VW Transporters are welcome! Please visit the web site at
