Subject: EZ Camper

The EZ Camper (Kombi based) I found last Friday finally made it home
today. After a good power wash it's not that bad looking. The rear
corners are rough as is the drivers dogleg. Interior is complete, blah,
blah, blah.

At any rate I got the couple parts I needed from it so now I'm going to
either part it out, or what I'd like to do is sell it whole to someone
(cheap).

If anyone's interested drop me an email. I'll get pictures of it
tomorrow.

Greg
