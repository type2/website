Subject: Running cool, too cool?

Checked the archives, and most need the opposite. My 1600 SP seems to
run just a tad too cool. No guages, I am all stock. Heat sux.

No preheat to OE aircleaner, yet.
Heater boxes, Dansk HD. Stock heat system intact. Drools out lukewarm at
defrosters. Oil dipstick could be held without problems after any run.
Feels about 120?-125?
Stock exhaust.
Stock fuel system.
Doghouse, well sealed at all tin connections.
Hoover bit intact.
New everything.

Besides being too RICH, anything else to check out to slightly increase
oil temps/heat output?

Dwell at 50.
Timing with 009 done dynamically to 28 at 2500+ rpm. Static turns out
around 9.
