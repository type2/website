Subject: Seattle Area Painting for VW

This is my first posting to this list and I have seen a ton of great info 
being passed along about vintage VW's. So, I know that this is the place to 
get answers.

I have been thinking of getting my '62 EZ Camper painted and I am not sure 
where to start. Living in the Seattle area, a good paint job is vital to the 
life of any vintage VW. I think that you can literally watch these things 
melt if they are not taken care of.

I would like to find a shop in this area that specializes in Vintage VW's. 
First, for their expertice and to give them my business. If I was to wait 
untill Summer I may just buy a gun and a compressor and do it myself, but 
that may be more work than I am able to tackle. Does any one know of a good 
resto shop or auto paint shop in the Pacific NorthWest that does great VW 
work? I would even drive to Northern Oregon for a good shop. I am really 
looking for stock paint colors and good work. Any leads would be helpful!

Thanks in advance,
Joshua 'Ukedude'
