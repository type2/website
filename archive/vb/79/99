Subject: Does your bus have these? anyone??

When i was pulling off the overhead vent access plate recently, I noticed I
had these screws

(screws are full size in pic)

Normally I woulda thought, no biggie, PO installed junk. Then i noticed
that the heads are *identical* to the unique truck bed slat screws shown
here which are the same but slightly bigger

So i asked a few people and most laughed and said "wtf are those??" Most
people had phillips dome head on theirs. I did find one guy who has a 57
and a 61 with the same exact screws on his and says his plates/screws have
never been removed - so there has to be something to this. (he also has a
two 66's and a 67 that have phillips dome heads)

I Looked in the parts manual and didnt see any callouts for screws used. I
looked in a 55 workshop manual and saw a *drawing* showing phillips screws
with a phillips screw driver putting them in, and another drawing showing
slotted heads over in the 'headliner' section. One strange thing is that,
that screw is the *only* screw that I found in the manual which they
refered to as a "Fillister" screw. The rest of the screws are simply
reffered to as "screws". I first thought this might be a year to year thing
but now I am unsure.
so far I have found:
19 buses thru all the years and 3 of them had these screws.

VW used slotted screws on all the early door panels, truck headliner trim,
and other misc parts. yet phillips on the rest of the parts. Why.

Has anyone else owned or seen a bus with those screws? please let me know
via list or p-mail
Thanks
