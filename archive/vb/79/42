I'm assuming that this mild bang and assorted clunking noises
stopped your forward progress? Also assuming that you meant that
the wheels wouldn't move at all in any gear while up on the
stands? IF that was what you meant, then perhaps your pinion gear
broke off or tranny input shaft broke? Hard to say with your
description. Either way would require engine removal along with
several other quite large bits of the car like the transaxle.
Doesn't matter how long you've been driving splits, because this
doesn't sound good for anyone if I've interpreted your message
correctly. Post some more info and maybe we can help more...
