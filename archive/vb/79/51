Ouch.
Shift coupler is all good right? You are actually engaging gears with
your shifter, not just flopping about loosely?
Don't the drive wheels usually turn slowly (when off the ground) even
if the trans is in neutral (engine running)? Does yours do that much?

If I describe the problem well, and ask for help nicely....

shifting was getting a little stiff from 2>3 & 3>4, starting heading
home
shift from 2>3 after stop sign and a mild bang followed by some
whirring and
a bit of clunking in the back end.

Clutch pedal has feel.
engine will run and sounds normal.
Can move shifter into all positions(that are supposed to do something)
Put up on jackstands and started it, put into gear and nothing no
wheels
movement in any gear.

This may be old hat for some but I'm still trying to get to my first
hundred
miles in a split.

Gary
