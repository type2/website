Subject: RE: [VB] Heater cable

Thank you, my cable length at both ends were offset before and I ran a 2"
extension on one cable end for one heater box. Another short question, is
there any greasing requirements for this cable or should it be inserted dry
?

Hi Ray,
About a fifteen or thirty minute job depending on your skill.  The hardest 
part is getting the cable ends set for equal length.  Eric&Barb
