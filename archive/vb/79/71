Hi Ttackman,
Absolutely!  We saw/heard one break loose at a VW drag race on the starting 
line.  Suddenly sounded like Hell's bells (Not to melodious!) ringing away 
and could be heard across the entire event grounds.  They actually removed 
the axle tube and broken axle, installed a good used one and had it back on 
the track running in about an hour.
