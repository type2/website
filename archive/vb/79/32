Subject: Progressive carb

Fellow Oldies:

My son and I (mostly him!) are finishing off my new Bergmann 1835cc long =
block.  When we went to put the manifold and carb on, we found that the =
progressive carb choke tends to hit the fan shroud, and that the fuel pump =
is in the way.  We are using one of those Brosol fuel pumps that has the 4 =
screws on top and I guess can be rebuilt.

Anyone know which fuel pump will allow a progressive to sit on top with =
adequate clearance?  I assume it will be one of those Brazilian/Mexican =
cheapies, but which one? My local FLAPS (???, what is that)  Parts-For-Impo=
rts/Foreign Aid, has at least a couple different models/brands.

Thanks in advance.

Curt
