Subject: Oil Gauge hook up

I just received the oil temp gauge and sender from busdepot (Thanks Ron & Staff).  I have a question for those of you who use these or have installed these.  Where do you normally hook up the hot wire from the gauge?  I hate just splicing into a wire I pull out from behind the dash, is there a tab on the fuse box where this can be connected so that it only gets power when the ignition switch is on.  The last time I hooked one of these up on my old 66, the bus had this generic after market ignition switch with an "accessory" contact point hookup, so it was easy on this one.  But we are all stock on the new 71, so WHAT WOULD YOU DO??
