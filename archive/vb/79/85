I almost think it is easier to just buy an electric pump, but my son says no, because you have to route a pressure relief line back
to the tank.  Is this right?  I had one on my '73 Bug but it broke and my mechanic at the time just replaced it with a mechanical
one.

A fuel pressure return line is not needed for electric carb fuel pump
but is necessary for a fuel infection fuel pump. An in-line fuel
pressure regulator for electric carb fuel pump is only necessary to
control slightly excessive pressure, it will not reduce pressure from
a fuel injection fuel pump to work for the lower pressure of a carburetor.
If the electric carb fuel pump produces proper fuel pressure, a regulator
is not necessary. Your mechanic was a mechanical genius.
