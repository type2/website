Subject: Re: [VB] Good place to order parts.

As you've already heard...Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie!

I can't say enough about this guy..and will recommend him to anyone I can.

Just an example.....2 days ago...late afternoon on top of that, I ask my wife
to call Ronnie and order me some brake hoses( i was getting ready for work). 
FF to this morning..knock-knock---UPS with brake hoses.  I have never had to
wait more than a few days for my stuff to get here from Ronnie.
Quick service, good prices, and excellent technical advice.  Hell,  for the
advice alone, I would pay a little more.

Anyways...give him a call-you won't be sorry.
