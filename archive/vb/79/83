Hi Ray,
You are welcome.  The trick is to install the heater cable and only screw 
back in place the heater knob a turn or two.  Then slide under and measure 
the cable ends lengths to how they do or do not reach the cage like devices 
the cable clamps are held to the heater boxes.   If you just screw in the 
heater knob completely the cable halfs twist up, making any adjustment to 
balance the ends a untwisting pain.

 Another short question, is there any greasing requirements for this cable or 
should 
> it be inserted dry?

All cables must be greased.  Only the speedo cable can be installed without 
greasing, but is it a wise move to work some light oil into it.  Even when 
installing a new reserve switch cable and it's sheath.  You must remove the 
cable out of it's sheath and grease it before reinserting into the sheath.  
Without greasing you soon enjoy a hard two handed pull needed for reserve.  A 
great additive to lubricants for low RPM and/or low stress areas is graphite 
and last far longer than grease or oil it is mixed with.  You can sift 
graphite out of pencil shavings from your pencil sharpener in a pinch!
