Subject: Do I need to take the engine out? (neophyte Q)


If I describe the problem well, and ask for help nicely....

shifting was getting a little stiff from 2>3 & 3>4, starting heading home
shift from 2>3 after stop sign and a mild bang followed by some whirring and
a bit of clunking in the back end.

Clutch pedal has feel.
engine will run and sounds normal.
Can move shifter into all positions(that are supposed to do something)
Put up on jackstands and started it, put into gear and nothing no wheels
movement in any gear.

This may be old hat for some but I'm still trying to get to my first hundred
miles in a split.

Gary
