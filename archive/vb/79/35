I tried this method before and it just made things worse for me, as instead
of big chunks of crud I started to get really fine rust powder in the gas,
which was clogging filters at an alarming rate.  After several months and
about 50 fuel filters, I finally pulled it out again and sealed it with a
can of fiberglass resin from Kanadian Tire.  So far, so good.
