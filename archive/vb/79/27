Yet another "classic" way to clean a rusty tank is to
thread a piece of chain down through the neck, wiring
or otherwise securing one end outside the tank. 
Rattle it around until the tank is clean, and then you
can withdraw the chain without having to fish out the
last piece of gravel or nut and bolt.
