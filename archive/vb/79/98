My Bus (13 November 1963) was probably on a boat headed for 
San Fransisco then.  

From http://www.westegg.com/inflation/ , from 1963 to 2001, rounded:

>1958 Volkswagen, black, sun roof, radio, asking  $695.   call RE-36544

$3900

>1962 Karmann Ghia coupe, ebony black, white walls, white top, radio, 
>   like new, asking  $1795.

$10,100
     
>1963 Volkswagen sedan, executive car, low miles,  $1545.

$8,700

>1961 Micro Station wagon, great in every respect,  $1395.

$7,900

>1958 Volkswagen Micro Station Wagon, completely reconditioned,  $895   
>    Call RE-91126

$5,000

So, have you called anybody to see if they still have the car?  There
is a listing for at least one of those numbers...

For more recent VW ads, I saw an ad during the Olympics on NBC earlier
this week.  Briefly, it showed line drawings of people standing around
a Beetle, then a splittie, then a late-model Jetta, then a New Beetle.
The last scene shows people standing looking down a road, presumably
at the next vehicle from VW.

I don't remember if the Bus was a Deluxe or what, but I do remember
that it had the later turn signals.  I think the Beetle had a big
rear window, too.  For some reason, the logo on the front of the Bus
wasn't fuzzed out.
