Subject: California to EveryBus 2002

I have just received notice that at least one bus from the Stockton 
California area is planning to attend EveryBus 2002, This is indeed 
an honor. Britt will be linking up with a larger caravan coming from 
the central plains states. If any more of you west coast or central 
US folk want to hook up with the caravan they would be glad to have 
you. Hint, hint, Nikki.

Check out the North American caravan list that is growing on the 
EveryBus web site.
