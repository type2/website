Vee Dub Knuts,

Ray Heath responded to my question yesterday about mounting space problems =
with a Weber progressive.  He said that a '74-79 fuel pump would do the =
job.  Wouldn't you have to change in inner plunger?  Aren't they different?=
  I believe they are longer in the newer pumps, right?=20

I almost think it is easier to just buy an electric pump, but my son says =
no, because you have to route a pressure relief line back to the tank.  Is =
this right?  I had one on my '73 Bug but it broke and my mechanic at the =
time just replaced it with a mechanical one.

Best,

Curt
