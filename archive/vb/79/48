Subject: Slave Cylinders


We have a very large handful of OLD slave cylinders from an old panel my son 
is reworking... big nut.  Now, he replaced the old cylinders already but... 
in the before time you could rebuild these things couldn't you?  I have had 
old Saabs (ever see a 2-stroke, 3-cylinder Saab 93 with suicide doors?) and 
Fiats that you could get kits to redo these things...  I don't suppose you 
still can for our beasts can you?  We were debating tossing them in next 
weeks trash.  Thoughts?

If you have any thoughts on this plz post before 11 tomorrow.  I will be off 
list for a long weekend into Oregon to say goodbye to my good friend and 
Brother-in-law who will probably not see Easter if the doctors are right and 
the big C takes him.
