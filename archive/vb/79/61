Subject: FW: [VB] (Friday) Don't forget... Was Header woes

Back when I was new to VW's and did not have much mechanical smarts, I
tightened my flywheel on to what felt tight to me.
I used a 1/2 drive ratchet that was about 12" long.  Needless to say the bus
made it about 4-5 blocks before the flywheel spun off and ruined my crank
and alot of other stuff...oh yeah, it was an engine i just bought and had
less than 10 miles on it.  After having it rebuilt again, everything works
fine and I don't work on my engine too much anymore.
