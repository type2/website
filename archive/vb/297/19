The how-to section in Thoms website tells you all about the bay tank.

  Ok so that was strike 1 at  fixing my running out of gas problem. I knew
id have to change filters pretty often and since i dont drive it all that
often I figured i could deal with it. Filter 1 got 48 miles before i couldnt
even keep it running. I put on filter 2 and made it home. Ive got about 46
miles left on this one (and i have 6 spares). What bay tank do I need? Ive
heard conflicting advice but
1972 keeps coming up.  Earlier comes up as not fitting as well as later. I
cant imagine finding a good tank in a bus so bad it ends up parted out or
junked. Dont make me find a beer barrel. ;)
I know i need to cut the neck off mine (and the rest of the tank will meet a
REAL untimely demise, most likely getting run over by my tahoe), and I need
a rubber hose and hose clamps to join the outlet of the tank to the neck i
cut off. Where do i get this hose? Will it work of the original bay setup if
i happen to get it with the tank? Im going to look into restoring mine but
this isnt too likely as bad as mine apparently is. It looks great on the
outside, the inside is apparently not as nice.
