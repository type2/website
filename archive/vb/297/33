Subject: Re: [VB] Any Johnny Lightning toy candidates out there?

    They did use my bus picture that we sent them but they reversed it and
cut out the back ground so it is a pretty generic '66 VW SC picture but you
can see some of the interior stickers in the photo so I say look at the
stickers in the bus and the ones in the picture.  See it is my bus.  Since
they used my bus to make the molds for the original toy they sent me 2 cases
of the toys (96) but I think that they only offer a box of 12 now!   Right
now it has a deer dent in it that will be fixed by Pete Lucas in Lincoln.
Nice to have him here in the Midwest as I know of no one else around to even
want to look at the job!  Here is a pic of the dent.
http://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/index.mv?photo+120521.jpg I hit the deer
doing less than 10 mph and didn't even knock him down.  It was weird as he
looked at me as I hit him in the butt as he ran from the right to left after
avoiding him the first time when he ran left to right.  If I had safaris I
could of goosed the deer!  I like that.....Goosing the dear!!
