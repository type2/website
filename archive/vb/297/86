Subject: Insulation?

I want to insulate behind the cab door panels in my '63 panel. I have used many different types of insulation over the years (fiberglass, ceramic wool, sheet styrofoam) all with varying levels of success. I have recently read about something that I thought I might give a try:  fill the interior cavity of the door frame with styrofoam beads that are retained by the use of a loosely fitted interior 'bag' that is carefully installed so as to fill the nooks and crannies in the door cavity. To finish off I will still use the 3 mil plastic sheathing that is glued at the top and tucked in at the bottom door cavity to direct water out the bottom door drain holes, and coating the backsice of the WW door panels with POR-15, and punching out (not drilling) the door panels for the screw holes so that the panel can move around a little bit and it fits better.

Has anyone else used this loose styrofoam beads in a bag method? Think it is a good idea?

My next idea is a little more time consuming but I know will probably provide the best insulation in terms of both heat retention and sound deadening - apply a 3M Spray-On Urethane Foam directly to the interior metal suraface of the door metal that is directly exposed to the exterior, after all urethane foam about 5/8 inch thick is what covers most aircraft cabins (and the liquid hydrogen fuel tanks on the space shuttle). I will allow the foam to harden after spraying then trim to allow internal mechanisms to operate without interference and for interior door panels to fit than TaDa- modern insulation in a 'ol Bus!
