I recv'd a cool diagram showing all the parts but the print is too fine for 
me to read. BTW I did order a new oil cooler as a result of advice I got from 
this list instead of trying to clean my old one.
Hi Jim,
First go to Vintagebus.com then left click on the "Parts Manuals" on the left 
side screen.  This will take you to the 
"Obsolete Air-Cooled Documentation Project" !
  Scroll down to the "Type II VW Parts Reference (1958-1967)" and look 
through the #1 Main Group, which is the engine section.  Look for the Cooling Air 
Control parts in the 151-623 Part Designations.  There is a great amount of 
exploded drawings of these parts and info.
  Best for your engine to get a full Doghouse shroud and cooler for your 
engine and full flow filter.  Especially for a bus!!!  We prefer the oil 
filter/pump for our engines, but there are some of these we would only use as ash trays 
(Bugpack is one of these) and since we do not smoke they are thusly worse 
than useless.
  The thermostatic flaps used on the doghouse are the same except for the 113 
119 289 connecting rod was replaced with 113 119 289 B.
