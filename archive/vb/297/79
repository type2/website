 This 1967 SC was owned for over 20+ years by Randy Ingersoll a VW and
Porsche guy for many years, of Palm Desert , California who did a LOT of the
work-- The wheel base is 4 feet shorter-than a Bug/Bus

Sporting Posche Alloys-and a 1951 Barndoor dash,  and a Single 48IDA, which
living in Emissions Phoenix,  I will have to get it off of the "Silver
Bullet",-- Bummer.  This shortening job was done many years ago by a VW
Dealership in California, Plunkett Motor Company. If you have Colin
Burnham's Air Cooled Volkswagens , go to page 86--The truck shows up in
various books in Blue--I have yet to detail the SC, and it really fits in
with my old fashioned ways -- lowered, shortened and flames.
I'm sure there will be complaints--I'm pretty used to it by now--But I
bought it this way, and will enjoy every minute of it--It does have a great
history--uj, TWWM
