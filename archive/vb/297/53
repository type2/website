Subject: Need thermostat paraphenalia

I've never had a thermostat on my engine and I need all the stuff for my new
1776 longblock project. I can find the thermostat accordion thing but where
could I get all the mounting brackets, flaps and the like for my '65 bus. I
recv'd a cool diagram showing all the parts but the print is too fine for me
to read. BTW I did order a new oil cooler as a result of advice I got from
this list instead of trying to clean my old one. I spent hard earned bread
on this longblock so I want to do it right and get good advice along the
way. Thanks in advance, Jim
