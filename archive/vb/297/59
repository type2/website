Subject: Re: [VB] Need thermostat paraphenalia

> I've never had a thermostat on my engine and I need all the stuff for my new
 1776 longblock project. I can find the thermostat accordion thing but where
 could I get all the mounting brackets, flaps and the like for my '65 bus. I
 recv'd a cool diagram showing all the parts but the print is too fine for me
 to read. BTW I did order a new oil cooler as a result of advice I got from
 this list instead of trying to clean my old one. I spent hard earned bread
 on this longblock so I want to do it right and get good advice along the
 way. Thanks in advance, Jim

Are you building the engine using a doghouse fan shroud or the original non-doghouse?
It makes a big difference on the flap crossbar and how it connects to the flaps.
Two different bars....
