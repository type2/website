Hi again Jim,
Forgot to mention along with the differant newer Connecting Rod that the 
doghouse had two mini control rods called Regulating Rods part # 113 119 411 A on 
each flap set (oficaily called Cooling Air Regulator, left & right).  To help 
push the newer Control Rod farther forward to clear the cooler housing that 
was pushed forward by the designers.  
  We have found only one and one only Connecting Rod which was designed to 
work without these Regulating Rods.
