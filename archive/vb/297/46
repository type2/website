good point,
   well, they didn't fall out it seemed to require some force using the tool that bus-boys rented me (pretty cool tool even has a groove so that when you install bushings top one will protrude the required amount, thinj $20 or so to rent.
   I'm going out on a limb here and suggesting that the old bushings were worn in an "out of round" manner which in turn caused uneven wear on the bushing hole, if this was the case, the old bushings would still be uneasy to remove?
i hope these thoughts you Matt -
