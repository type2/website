> But there really is a horrible bias againt women w/ cars. Nothing personal you guys, but society just tells people these things (tells men and women), and I can see it ... thoughts twirling as it filters through the brain that I know what I'm saying and I'm not a guy and them trying to reconcile these two things they don't have experience as fitting together.

yeah, i've experienced men treating me like a woman and/or trying to rip me off when it had to do with my vw. it's been kind of fun because i feel like i can put them in their place... but i know that after a while it would wear thin.*

the other end of it is talking about automotive issues with guys that have no experience. one guy i know is a rocket scientist (like sam) and very smart but has nothing to offer in the way of automotive conversation, he gets visibly uncomfortable when i start talking about charging systems, fuel delivery, etc.

i also get some static at home. i dunno why exactly except maybe that the way i learned was from a mechanic trying to keep his customer's old beat cars on the road at reasonable costs. i didn't necessarily learn to fix it the factory way or the correct way or even the bentley way - i just learned to fix it. i have a suspicion that there is a certain level of testosterone involved as well though.

so what i try to do is buy my parts from shops that don't give me attitude and when i'm with the rocket scientist, we don't talk about automotive stuff. i'm also trying to learn to fix things the bentley way. i still brag a bit about my installations that involve bailing wire and plumbers tape though... just for fun and to those that i think can laugh about it.

overall i find that men treating me like an incompetent when it comes to my vw is about as irritating as people that automatically think i'm a vegetarian. the nice thing about our group is that it's extremely rare for a fellow vw person to treat me like a incompetent. i find i can't even use the dumb chick thing to try to get better prices on swap stuff.

*dude tried to sell me four tires instead of the two i wanted, said that all the tires needed to have the same tread to wear properly. i told him that i thought it only mattered axel to axel. he shut up and i went elsewhere.

another time i took my beetle, vent frame and glass to an auto glass place to put together figuring they had the materials. dudes used black silicone and wedged the glass so deep in the frame that there was a significant gap between the rubber seal and glass edge. when i asked the supervisor about the job, he told me that he was doing me a favor and it was the best they'd do. i ended up redoing the job myself and now there's no gap.
