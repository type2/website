i think the number must be wrong. the second group of
numbers, "323" would indicate a transmission part, but
i don't think they don't go that high. my guess is
that it would be "823", which would make a little more
sense if  it's a rubber seal of some kind. the number
given is not in any of my parts manuals.
 
but i could just be completely insane.

and just because it has a "113" does not it is bug
specific. there are plenty of parts on busses that
start with "113"


a pic would definitely help. 

this sounds like a question for '67 Transporters with
his multitude of parts manuals!
