If the opening in the beam was worn, the old bushings would have been loose
and would not have required much force to remove them. Was that indeed the
case?

The kit I bought from Ronnie was german and had I (think the name Menze?) it
was in a bue box ( ithink ).  Anyway, I found the OD of the bushings too
small as well.  I didn't have a micrometer so I don't know what the OD size
vs. bema hole size was.  My bushings were just loose enough to stay in plac
but could be moved with slightest easy.
Hmm I think - how the hell can I ream bushings if they turn while I try to
ream em?  I assumed that my beam "hole" was worn.
