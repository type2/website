Hiya Jim
FWIW, I'd advise going out and buying a new oil cooler. 

They can be cleaned, but after all this effort why risk 
killing a fresh engine with a chunk of dookie loosened up 
from an attempt at cleaning the oil cooler?  Said dookie 
could travel anywhere in the oil system and block some 
spot like a main or rod bearing inlet.  In the oil system 
there should be no such thing as frugality, since that's 
what keeps your engine running lubed and cool

You've gone and spent good $$ on stuff that'll make the 
outside look nifty but all the gee-wizzz looker stuff 
won't get you there and back again..

My longblock from Quality German Auto arrived and I'm 
  ready to put the stuff
  from my kaput motor on it but I have some questions. Is 
  there a way for me to clean my oil cooler (dog house 
generic type)because I want to do this right the first 
time.  I've purchased new engine hardware nuts and stuff 
and some engine tin.
