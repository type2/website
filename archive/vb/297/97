I personally hope they do change the exterior design (along with the new
chassis), the current concept vehicle looks horrible (IMHO).

If they put a smooth front end (no creased seam between the hood and the
windshield), round headlights and massaged in some of the good ol'
"cleavage" like a split, I think it would be alot more sucessful than what
it will be if they keep the current design.

But, either way, since VWoA is selling it, I wouldn't buy one anyway.
