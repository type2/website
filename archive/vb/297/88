A good time to get under the bus and learn a bit more.  Block
> it up nicely and start crawling  :-)

A whole different world appears. Getting under the bus, laying on large
cardboard in gravel, sloping driveway. It may not be the nice clean concrete
floor to glide on with a creeper with good lights and shop heater that would
be most preferred.

I hooked up the heater cables, heater tubes and adjusted the clutch. It only
took ten minutes or so.
