Subject: Re: [VB] Oil leak at Oil Pump cover

Ya, I never had a oil leak at the oil pump before.  I think this was caused by the high pressure from the dumb heavy duty relief springs. anyone want them?  NOT for use in temperate climates.  

  The pump and pump cover and case were practically new... no signs of wear on the cover!!!!!  checked, and it was level and flat.  this was an engine w/ 10 K miles on it (on new case, crank, cam, heads, oil pump, etc) that I tore down, cleaned out, and reassembled as there were crusties inside after it was in a fire, everything standard standard very nice.   full flowed w/ filter.  

I guess I'll have to pull the pump / cover and reseal it... in the meantime there is a small ooze/drip.
