Same thing here. I resurface the pump cover, and use a very thin smear of
Curil T (no gasket), and my pump covers don't leak. I think the biggest
trick is to not get any sealant in the groove around the perimeter of the
pump gears. Any oil that goes out past the gears gets sucked back to the
inlet side of the pump. If some sealant is in this groove, the oil won't get
sucked back into the pump, and will be forced out between the pump and the
cover.
