Craig hit the nail on the head.  I think it IS a hood seal for a bug.  

It has two molded corners with 3 "barbs" directly opposite of the corner
(outside of the curve if you will). The two ends are straight 90 degree cuts.

Its been about 10 years since my bug resto, but the more I look at it I
realize that it is exactly what Craig said...a bug hood seal. I knew I'd
seen it before, but I'd only ever used crappie repops and had never seen
real "molded" corners on that seal before! 

It is NOS because it has that gummy rubber preservative still on it and
like all factory rubber for windows and door seals it has the 5 or 6
very fine parallel lines running the length of it.  Not sure what they
do, but you see it on all factory rubber....oh and those PERFECT window
seals Ronnie had made up last year :-)

Thanks for all the input and sorry it wasn't bus related!

BTW what are the Havasu dates?
