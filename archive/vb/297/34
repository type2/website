Alot of you either know my daughter or have heard of her,Kelly I Aka Punk,
She just turned 20 this month, she can weld some, change her own oil, do
tune ups, fabricate parts, cut away rusted sheetmetal, pound dents, she can
spot crappy workmanship almost as good as i can, She's not great by no means
but for her age she's damn good, She is not intimdated by parts counter
people or by service managers or mechanics. Currently she is  attending
college for commercial graphics and computer graphics. With college and a
full time job at a local grocery store she don't get in much shop time, But
that hasn't detered her love of cars as she hits local street rod meets as
often as she can. In a pinch for help my wife has even lended a hand lifting
something or pushing one in and out of the shop and even has had her turn
operating the wheel end of a rotary former. Don't count the ladies out guys,
ya might meet one sometime that knows as much or  more than you do. My .02
