Subject: Quilted Window Insulation for Winter Camping - Now $99

I have just 6 sets of quilted window covers left, and have reduced them
to $99 for quick sale just in time for the cold weather. This is below
original wholesale. No more coming when they're gone. These are a "must"
for cool weather camping (and a great Xmas gift :-).
