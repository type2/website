 Buten kit    pin and bushings only
bushing OD    29.3 mm
bushing ID    24.1
pin diameter  23.8

  FEBI/Bilstein kit complete with pin, bushings, bolts, seals etc.
bushing OD   29.3
bushing IN   24.00
pin diameter 23.8

Both kits have bronze bushings, grooved for grease
The Buten kit the bushing fits over the pin without reaming whereas the
FEBI/Bilstein kit requiries reeming. I have not installed the Buten bushings
so I cannot verify the need for reeming or not

note that the bay window kits have a steel looking bushing that is split

List,

Thanks to all for your input.

I installed a swing lever kit a few years ago on
another bus with no trouble.  It came with the
original style, solid brass bushings but i do not
remember who the mfg was.  I guess that is what i am
hoping to locate to fix my DC.
