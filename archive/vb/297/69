Subject: Re: [VB] Need thermostat paraphenalia

65 bus thermostat set up's the same as a bug, luckily, so you can get them 
off junkyard bugs.   If you know someone with a pile of fan shrouds, looks at 
them for the flaps, etc.   Local VW shops?  At one point I found some mail order 
place selling the vertical rod, which is most often missing, and needs to go 
through the cylinders/head in just the right place.  The bracket is bolted to 
the side of the case.

Are you going doghouse or no dog?

 If a junkyard only has later beetles, I can still find useful dash light 
bulbs, and thermostat/doghouse stuff.

IN the OACDP picture, put yr mouse on the picture, and a square with arrows 
at the corners will appear, click on it and the picture gets big and you can 
read all the details.

1776 longblock project. I can find the thermostat accordion thing but where
could I get all the mounting brackets, flaps and the like for my '65 bus. I
recv'd a cool diagram showing all the parts but the print is too fine for me
to read. BTW I did order a new oil cooler as a result of advice I got from
this list instead of trying to clean my old one. I spent hard earned bread
on this longblock so I want to do it right and get good advice along the
way. Thanks in advance, Jim
