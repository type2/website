Props for what years?

   Coming soon (prototype approved, sitting in front of me) reproduction
deck lid props. Tired of paying big money for broken used ones, tired of
your decklid hitting you in the head?  Your troubles will soon be over,
reasonably priced deck lid props, as good as original. I am going to paint
an NOS one and a repo and have a "who can tell me which is real contest"
