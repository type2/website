  I didn't take any offense. I just want to make sure that IF there is a
problem in a part I sell I am aware of it before someone else has the same
problems. That is one reason why I have QUIT selling SACHs Brazil pressure
plates, they do not center properly and can cause vibration and premature
wear to the thrust bearing and/or transmission input shaft.

OG (NOS) bushings I can measure against to see of their is a manufacturers
problem

ronnie -

I'm not accusing you of having wrong bushing parts!! Only put that info for
matt in case he wanted to find out if has used the bushing kit you sell.  

Believe me my bus has been through a hard life, I am very sure I have worn
beam opening!!

I love oldvolks.com !!
