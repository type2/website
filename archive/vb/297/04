Subject: RE: [VB] women & mechanics

I read posts from Clara and Rachel and think good thoughts.  I'm glad to
see the diversity and have no problem with women mechanics.  Heck, as a
prerequisite, I'm insisting that my daughter is capable of the bare
essentials; fan belt, oil, tire, lube... before I hand her over the.
(she just turned 16 and is pushing me to get one of my bugs running for
her...)

But the real reason for the post is from the reading of Rachel which
brought to mind a joke that a good friend of mine sent me... she's a
lawyer and gender studies professor at our local university...  it read:


"On a recent flight, a plane passes through a severe storm. The
turbulence is awful, and things go from bad to worse when one wing is
struck by lightning.

One woman in particular loses it. Screaming, she stands up in the front
of the plane. "I'm too young to die," she wails. Then she yells, "Well,
if I'm going to die, I want my last minutes on earth to be memorable! Is
there ANYONE on this plane who can make me feel like a WOMAN?"

For a moment, there is silence. Everyone has forgotten their own peril.
They all stared, riveted, at the desperate woman in the front of the
plane.

Then a man stands up in the rear of the plane. He is gorgeous: tall,
well built, with dark brown hair and hazel eyes. He starts to walk
slowly up the aisle, unbuttoning his shirt...one button at a time.
...No one moves.
...He removes his shirt.
...Muscles ripple across his chest.
...She gasps...
...He whispers:

"Iron this, and get me something to eat....""



Ok, it's not Friday.  And please don't ever think I'd condone this
behavior :-)
