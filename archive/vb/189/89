Subject: RE: [VB] Welding trouble

Two items I broke a $100 bill on was a touch point spot welder and a low
voltage stitch welder handle. Both of these attach to my "hot" side of my
100 amp arc welder. The spot welder handle is a trigger type with built in
ground ring points at the nose. You press it up flat against the metal to be
spot welded and then slowly pull the trigger lowering the spot weld anode
against the metal. The current flow is to an isolated section minimizing any
warpage from heat. The stitch welder handle is a diode isolated DC
converting tip that lowers the voltage and allows welding sheet metal as
thin as that on an appliance. I have welded the feet back on washers and
dryers where the metal bent an tore with no problem.

Joel, something else to keep in mind when welding the
thinner metals is to use the 75/25 Argon/CO2 mix. 
Some distributors will sell you CO2, and while CO2
works better on the thicker metals (frame) it burns
too hot for thinner metals and it causes more spatter
and smoke.  The Argon/CO2 mix has less spatter (cleans
up better) and provides less penetration into the
metal you are working on than CO2.  So, CO2=good
penetration for thicker metals and Argon/CO2=cleaner
welds & less penetration.  Also ESAB sells a .023
ER70S-6 solid wire that is perfect for sheet metal. 
Always buy in the 10-12# rolls also because you pay
about half of the price per pound of wire.  Use Heat
Fence around your welds also to reduce the area
affected by the heat, you can usually find this at
your local welding shop (Airgas).
