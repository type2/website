Subject: Re: [VB] seat discolor

I've used Simple Green to clean seats.   (and door panels and floor mats and 
vinyl headliners etc)

Found that glycerin really helps reastore the suppleness of the real vinyl 
leatherette  material that VW used for seats.   Its cheap, and use it 
liberally, wait overnight for it to soak in, and use it again.  The mesh 
platinum and mesh grey material is the worst for ripping, so good luck.

 sorta yellow.  There is one part on the back that never seen daylight or

 that isn't discolored.
 What kind of chemicals do you guys use to get it looking good again?
