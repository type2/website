cooling system, shroud and all!  Not the same situation as a bus.

The key word here is "completely".  They don't have a body to redirect the
hot air back into the engine bay.

recirculate into the engine bay.

Just make sure that all the seals are in place in the engine bay and that
all the proper tin is present.  Then your bus will cool fine.
Save that extra lid, someone will need it.
