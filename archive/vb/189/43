classic vintagebus ellis.

i do see my doublecab as a turtle in time. we know how far turtles go back,
and we have seen some in light of their possible extinction. turtles in
trouble, right here right now. when i see the slow resto turtle with a
split on top i say that's close. save a turtle family.

now on the other hand, i have a 1by1 sticker on my car that says god give
me the strength to sell my car. is any of that do-able?  - steve
