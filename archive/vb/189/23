Subject: what happens without the engine lid?

     I remember as a kid (I'm 24) a custom single cab
driving around Napa.  It had the engine lid removed,
and the license plate hanging from the bottom of the
gates.  Also it seems most drag bugs have the lids
removed.  Plus all the sandrails and buggies have
completely exposed engines.
     If I remove the engine lid will it help the
engine run cooler?  If it is beteer to leave it on,
how would louvers, a whole bunch, or small amout
change the airflow?  I have an extra lid, so I can
leave one nice.  Who knows about the aerodynamics of
the engine bay?
