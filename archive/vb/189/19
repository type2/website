Subject: times they are changeing

I hope there will be more of the young generation into busses.  I have seen
a few of them at vw shows, restoring some old bus out of a salvage yard back
to factory.  I'm one of these, and at 21 I plan on owning my bus for the
rest of my life. Call me yuppie,  redneck, or computer geek, I love my bus.
it will be a part of me for a long time.
