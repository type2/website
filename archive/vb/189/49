Subject: Welding trouble

Good day bus drivers,
I have this '67 Flintstones bus (no engine, no floor) and I am trying to put it
back together. I've started with the eventually unseen bits of minor framing
under the cargo floor, as I need the welding practice before moving on to the
bits that will be seen. Mostly it is going well, I can do the fake spotwelds all
day, overlapping metal welds are getting better inch by inch. But I am burning a
lot of metal and generally making a mess of butt welds on that skinny
sheetmetal. I've gotten slightly better with practice, but I still think I must
be missing some technique or trick. I had really hoped to butt weld the new
floor sections to the old, so I either need to figure this out or accept
overlapping the pieces, which to me looks like a built-in rust pocket.
I hope there is a trick I am missing someone will tell me about. The welder is a
new Lincoln 110V wirefeed with gas, and seems to be working properly. I turn it
all the way down to make the butt welds, and the faster I move the better I do,
but I'm still burning too much metal to try this with the floor.
Thanks, Joel
'64 Sundial (doing great)
'67 Kombi (in trouble deep)
