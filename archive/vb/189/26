Subject: re:removing the engine lid

not an air-flow specialist, but i do recall it being mentioned more than
once-leave the engine lid closed, and well sealed.

i think the engine compartment/engine area is designed to create a vacuum,
so that it draws air into it, and cools itself off...if you open the lid,
you screw with the air flow around the engine....and it doesn't cool
properly that way..
