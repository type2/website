They may take a little time to seat in, but I don't think you should
still have a red light fresh out of the box.  In the Bentley, VW does
mention that the load tests cannot be done on a freshly overhauled
generator because the brushes take some time to bed in.  Do the brushes
seem to move freely in their holders?  Are the springs that push on
them fairly strong?

When I worked over my wiper motor, I didn't change the brushes but I
did polish the commutator.  When I fired it up (no load) it ran, but
would run faster if I pushed the brushes towards the commutator.  After
about 5 minutes or so of running, it had sped up a little and no longer
ran faster if I pushed in on the brushes, so I considered them seated
in and went ahead and installed the motor.

You might verify that the numbers stamped on the generator match what
you expect; most later Bosch generators have the voltage stamped on
them and this should match the voltage of your Bus.  If your regulator
mounts to the right side of the engine compartment, make sure there's a
bit of bare sheet metal under where the legs screw down as that is how
it grounds.  If all is well, give it 5 to 10 minutes of running and if
the light isn't out by then, go talk to whoever sold it to you.

Good luck!
