Subject: Red Light!!

Hi all,

Just bought a rebuilt generator and regulator.  Installed
everything, polarized it, started the bus and red light.

I had my 5 year old sit in the cab whil I fiddled with the brushes.

The lights seems to go on and off when I push the brushes around.

Is this normal for a rebuilt generator????  Do the brushes need
to seat themselves for a while?

Thanks
