Subject: clutch assembly

sorry for all the quick posts....

I finally got the clutch pedal lever out-it was bone dry in there...the
shaft had some surface rust on it. I sanded it down lightly with some 320
wet/dry sandpaper. cleaned out the tube area(where the bushings are located)
coated everything with some bearing grease-synthetic, put it back in,and it
slid right in, and spun freely. before it took considerable effort from my
arms to get the thing to spin. the hard part removing it, was my inability
to find a surface that i could hit well with a hammer.

for anyone that may need to do this in the future this is what i did:
sprayed penetrating lubricant on either end, wiggled lever back and forth
numerous time, while also trying to pull out. made tiny progress. then i
tried a pry bar, a couple times, got some more movement, then i hammered it
back in(this way you move the shaft in and out of the tube) kept at it for
about 20-30 minutes, eventually it came out, very begrudingly.

after clean up and relube-it popped right in no problem, no need to hammer.

I reconnected the clutch wing nut end, just to get it started, then got the
front clip on, then adjusted the clutch.

now i am going to take it for a spin,

thanks for your help, and thanks for the archives...
