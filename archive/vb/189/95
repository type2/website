ah yes, your bus likes grease  :)

It's nice to hear that people are hauling things with their buses.   Your 65 
was originally a one ton, still is if you have the big nut tranny and the 
easy pry off front axle nut covers.  So no problem hauling the concrete.

 what a difference. There is no struggle with my foot in pushing the pedal, i
 never knew it could be this good.
 
 one quick question:what is the payload of a '65 kombi. I took about 800 lb's
 of concrete the other day, bus handled well, lowered the center of gravity,
 felt like I was driving a BMW.
