Subject: Some engine questions

Hi all you list guru's :)
I need a new engine for my 57 kombi, I have a standard size single
relife case, stock standard crank (non CW) some single port heads that
have been massaged a little (single HD springs, and GB adjusters,
solid shafts) some slightly used 90.5 pistons, a used 110 cam with the
matching lifters, and a 31pict carb.

Now, my question, for a low CR (7.0), low HP, and low rpm (4500-4800
max) engine, will this combo work? Will it live? I have a non dog
house cooling system in good shape now, but I could upgrade if I had
to. There may be a set of Kadrons in the future also.

Thanks,

Matt Souza
