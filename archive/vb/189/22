The '67 parts book online lists the following:

Part           Chassis                    Mcode  Dates
211 953 521     20-117 902 -     614 455         Mar 1955 to May 1960
211 953 513 E      614 456 -     802 985         Jun 1960 to Jul 1961
211 953 513 E      802 986 - 215 190 000  M 24   Aug 1961 to Jul 1965
211 953 513 C      802 986 - 215 190 000         Aug 1961 to Jul 1965
211 953 513 D  216 000 001 - up                  Aug 1965
211 953 513 E  216 000 001 - up           M 24   Aug 1965

M 24 is USA electrics: all-red tail lights and sealed beams up front.

It seems a little odd to have the same switch used for Euro buses in '61
and US buses in '62-'65, but a US switch will electrically replace a Euro
one - you just use the flasher input and the two front turn signal outputs
and ignore the wires for the rear lamps.  I don't know if it will
mechanically replace it, but VW seemed to think so.

For the current discussion, it seems that the Euro and US versions of
the '66-up switches do have different part numbers - 211 953 513 D
for Euro and 211 953 513 E for US.

VW may have superceded the Euro switch to the US switch in a later parts
lists, because the US switch can electrically substitute for the Euro
switch as above.  Since Ken says the harness is longer on the US switches,
this would also point to the US switch being able to replace the Euro
switch.
