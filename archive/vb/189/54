I agree.  While I've not been welding for anywhere close to 30 years, I
think I know the technique you should use.

The final test is to weld two aluminum beer cans together at the bottoms.
90% of welding is fitting , the other 10% is technique.
Go for it, Practice, Practice, Practice.
I'd like to help more but I damn near went blind welding all those years.
