Subject: gauge holder

I read E&B's post about removing ashtray for gauge space, and thought I'd
mention a gauge holder that worked for me. VDO makes a rubber two-gauge
underdash mount with the two mounting holes almost identically spaced as the
headlight and hazard light switches on my early '64. I removed the screws
holding the switches in, replaced them with longer screws threaded through the
gauge mount. Two gauges, no drilling. Wiring space is a little tight but no
worse than the speedo.
