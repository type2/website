I am with Stan... The next group is attorneys :(

Just this weekend our basement renter friend brought over a date and he went 
ga-ga over the '67 I am restoring that was sitting in the driveway...??  
Confused me to pieces as I do not see that as a lawyer mobile.

Oh well.  When the "new" Microbus comes out the prices for our old ones will 
really sky rocket :(  Beetle prices never have really come down after the 
"new" Beetle came out either.

Take Care,
Adrian
