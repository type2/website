Dave, 40 hp rocker shafts and all other T-1/T-3 shafts are the same
diameter. The difference is in the angle of attack of the rocker arm. The 40
hp angle sets the geometry for 1:1 ratio and the 1300-1600 rockers are 1.1:1
ratio. I don't have my dimensions with me now but it is an angle change of a
few degrees.

Does anyone know how to i.d. a 40H rocker assembly?
I have a pile of assembled shafts and can't find them.
