Subject: Re: [VB] Front window rebuilding

The first thing you want to do is get all the rust out.   You can use a wire 
wheel on a drill, or a grinder, but get it all out, or it'll creep back.   If 
there are holes you can stick something through, you should get a patch piece 
and weld it in.   You'll find the metal is pretty thin around the rust hole.  
I think repro pieces are made, but I have no experience with them.   If it is 
the flat area, you can use a middle bar off a dead bus for patch pieces, but 
usually any bus with good window ledges is restorable, so it's hard to find 
that corner curve as a patch piece from german metal.   I've used spot filler 
to fill in rust dimples to get a smooth sealing surface before painting.  
Hope this helps.

 going to be using a metal filler, similar to 3M panel bonding adhesive.
 Does anyone have any tips on this?  I hope I'm making sense.
