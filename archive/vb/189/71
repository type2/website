So I guess you're talking a 1776cc? I have heard good
things about that size and a bus. If it's all apart
though, I would get a CW crank and doghouse set up. I
would prefer a new dual relief case to be
honest,especially if you are going to have to get it
bored for the bigger P & C's,  but if it's in good
shape and not too pounded use it. You could allways
put in an Okrasa engine too!
