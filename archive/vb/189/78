Subject: seat discolor

  I took my seat cover off today, and I found a pretty decent orginal mesh
platinum underneath. Only thing is, the mesh part is very discolored. Looks
sorta yellow.  There is one part on the back that never seen daylight or butts
that isn't discolored.
What kind of chemicals do you guys use to get it looking good again?
