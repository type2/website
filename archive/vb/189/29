hm, THink you should be able to start the engine and run it even if the 
voltage regulator isn't hooked up, so perhaps it is something else.   Do 
double check all your wires.  Does the engine turn over but not catch?  W/ a 
bad regulator teh engine should run but the gen light come on, I think 
brighter when you rev the engine
