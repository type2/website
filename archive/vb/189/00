YES, these are almost certainly euro versions. Both the US version and the 
Euro have the same part # from VW as best as I can tell, and I have a 
dealership parts book. I bought two of these for my 67 and am now stuck. The 
euro version wire bundle is too short for one thing also the euro versions 
don't have the left and right REAR turn siggy output which the US does. You 
will need euro version tail light assemblies and add some extra wiring to the 
extra bulb you will need to get them to work or so I have been told. I know 
of one guy who has bought a half dozen of these over the years for his fleet 
of 67s thinking they were US, after all the part # was correct, and only one 
turned out to be US. 

I wrote the seller and asked that he put in his ad what he really has but 
don't expect much more input. Buyer beware on this one. You have been warned. 
I know because I have been there and am sitting on 2 of them myself.
