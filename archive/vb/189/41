Hi David,
Is the bore of the MC rusty?  If so check out "Hemmings Motor News" for brake 
cylinder rebuilders.  They can overbore the cylinder and line it with brass 
or stainless which will last just about forever.  
  If the bore is straight and rust free you should be able to find brake 
specialists in your area or at least in your state for seals.
