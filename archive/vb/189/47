Subject: clutch cable broken?

I went to take my bus out today...over to my friends, and I needed the bus
as I was carrying a pumpkin pie, and some whipped cream. off to watch the
patriots game.

Well I pushed the clutch pedal down-and it stayed down....I thought maybe it
was the cold weather(or maybe  i hoped it was just the cold weather) anyway
i pulled the pedal up slowly & engaged 1st gear, drove to the end of the
block, push pedal in again-again it stayed on the floor.

I put the bus in neutral, and moved the pedal back and forth a few
times...did not seem to free the pedal up at all.

So I gently get it in reverse, and reverse back to my house, get my bicycle,
and leave the whip cream at home, but carry the pie over to my friends.
watch the game, thinking in the back of my mind what this probably means....

I am thinking that the clutch cable has frayed/broken inside the tube
running from the front to the back of the bus, and is therefore catching
inside the tube.

so simple solution-take the old cable out, and replace with a new cable. i
think that will be a monday morning event, although it will be tricky
getting it in the driveway, as it is quite a tight turn from my parking
spot.

does this sound correct?

thanks for any suggestions on diagnosis.

by the way the patriots won, and the pie was pumpkin(trial run for a pie I
am making for the family holiday dinner)
