Hi Cris,
First never use screw extractors on screws/bolts remains that broke off due 
to being stuck/corroded in place.  Screw extractors are much, much more 
harder than drill bits and thusly break off easily and can not be drilled 
out!  
  You should always drill the broken off fasteners with a starter drill bit 
much smaller than the diameter of the screw, and then work up in sizes of the 
drill bits.  Till you completely drill out the fastener leaving only it's 
outer threads in the threaded hole to be carefully tapped out.  If you end 
off center you stop way before the tap size for that hole when you hit 
threads on one side and punch the cresent shaped remains of the fastener 
inwards on it's self so you can turn or just pull out the remains.  
  It sounds like you went off center on that one you can now slip the tap 
through.  Since the threads are are in a thin plate inside the body you can 
not use a solid insert or heli-coil.  You probably will have to slit open the 
body, remove the inner plate and either weld up and redrill/tap the hole or 
replace it with one from a donor bus.   Eric&Barb
