Subject: Stretchy belt...?

To clarify, I'm not talking about the kind that goes around my waist, but 
the one in the back of my trusty bus. :) This question is pretty 
straight-forward, compared to my powdercoating one.

I am stretching alternator belts and I can't nail down the reason. Are they 
getting too hot? Is the adjustment incorrect? I'm not driving that fast for 
my 1776cc (60-65) and the RPM's aren't too bad (Type 1 trans w/3.88R&P), but 
they continue to elongate and cause me problems charging and whining 
problems. I've gone through two in 1200 miles and it's getting frustrating! 
I have the late-style pulley on it and have been fussing over the shims to 
get it 'just right' on a number of occassions, only to have to go back and 
do it again a few days later.
