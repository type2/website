Subject: Re: [VB] First time non-greeting from ACVW

Interesting that you bring this up for I have had the same thing happen to
me
lately. Seems when I am driving the split I only get about 50% of the bay
window crowd to wave and 90% of the split crowd. But when I drive the Bay I
get
probably 90% of the whole bus crowd to wave. I am not sure why this is for
they
both suck air. My only thought (sad as it is), is that sense my daily driver
split (63 23 window) is in fairly nice condition and some of the bays I pass
are classic working busses (like my other daily driver, 68 DC). They may
think
I am trying to say hey "look what I have compared to you." Personally I
think
this is pretty bogus for there is nothing further from my mind.

I use to have an old BMW that when I first got it as a project. No other
Beam
head would even dare raise a hand to wave, but as soon as I painted it, the
crowd began to wave. It kinda seemed that the crowd would rate the drivers
buy
the condition of their car, not that we were all enthusiasts loving our
vehicles. I hated this stuckupness. I was quite ready to sell the car once I
saw this.

I sure hope something like this attitude is not migrating to the Vedub
crowd.
Just a happy busser Shawn
