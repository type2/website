Subject: RE: [VB] 60 Era Panel RHD

Gang,

Once more with better grammar:

I saw a 60s Era Panel RHD in town today, how rare is this type of bus?  It
needs a nose and rear wheel well metal, paint, seats, body work...  I left a
note for the owner, however I am wondering if this is something special or
very ordinary.  Does anyone on the list have a Panel for sale that is in
better
shape.

-Wayne
