Subject: leaky tranny

Well, yesterday I finally got down to business with the old transmission
leak.  It seemed to be leaking from under the right side axle flange.  So I
took it apart, cleaned it up, sealed gasket to metal with red silicone
stuff, put it back together.  Filled with oil.  Yay.

Or not.  The leak seems just as bad as before, if not worse.  (&(*^%^!!  So.
I'm thinking either the leak is coming more from the general front
(nosecone?) of the transmission than from the side, or I didn't tighten the
bolts enough. (although I think I got them as tight as I could without
stripping them)  I need to drive my van to Nevada (from Vancouver, BC) in 2
weeks.  Cash available to deal with this: zero.

Options:
1.  Ignore it.  Fill as necessary.  It's worked for the last 30 000 miles,
why not now?
2.  Perform same fix on other side, on the off chance it might do something.
Waste the last three jugs of GL-4 tranny oil in town.  I'm serious, I had to
go to 4 different auto supply places (all the ones I know) to get it.
3.  ????  Suggestions?  Advice?  Is there anywhere else the leak could be
coming from that I could fix?  Boots are perfect.  I replaced the one on the
side I fixed even though it looks fine - saving it as a spare.  The right
side had way more crud on it so that is what led me to it.  Now the leak
seems to be coming from the centre.  Although it's dripping off the frame
rail so it's hard to tell.

TIA,
Diana
