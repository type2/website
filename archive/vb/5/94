Subject: NOS side locker panel lock mechanism on ebay

Hi folks,

After completing my single cab I'm left with a NOS side locker panel
lock mechanism.  The lock is NOS with two keys.  I've put it up on ebay
for your convienience and if you're interested:

or simply search by item number:  594112636 on www.ebay.com

It'd be nice to go to a worthy home...
