Subject: Re: [VB] First time non-greeting from ACVW

Your not A fReAk I honk or wave at all Bus Drivers and have even pulled over 
a splittie driver.  On a drive to Seqoiya this summer in the Sundial I was 
passed by one of those new fangled westfalias.  The driver was honking and 
the passengers were waving and hanging out the window taking pictures of 
me....  So there are more of us..... I hope..
