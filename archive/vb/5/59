Subject: Re: [VB] First time non-greeting from ACVW

Here in Southern California, if we waved at every bus we would have 
arm cramps. I typically reserve my waving for splitties because they 
are not as common (and I drive one). But if another bus driver waves, 
I always return the favor no matter what they are driving. My son and 
I love VW buses and we are always "checkout" splitties AND bays. (...)
