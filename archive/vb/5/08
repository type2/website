hey, ive seen some people on here talking about doing the type 4 conversion
to their split.  i just dug out two type 4 cases and wondered if anyone was
in need of them on here.  ive also got an align bore tool for a type 1 or
type 4 engine if anyone is interested in it.  i have no need for this stuff
and would like to pass it on to someone on the list before it goes to ebay.
thanks!
josh
