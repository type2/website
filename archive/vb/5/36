Subject: AIRS response needed on 512 just East of Tacoma Washington!!!

Hi Volks,
After being on the AIRS list for well over a year we suddenly have gotten two 
calls in two days.  One yesterday from a David who has a 77 and has yet to 
return our return call, and one today from a Greg who is stuck out on highway 
512 right now after just turning off Eastbound from I-5 Freeway!  Greg has a 
72 bus that just got a new (Rebuilt?) engine installed.  It just suddenly 
died like the ignition was switched off.  Could be a coil, condensor, 
ignition switch, wiring to any of these or some other electrical malfunction. 
 Sounds like he does not have any tools with him.  Greg called us via a 
Washington State Patrol radio/phone connection, so there is no way for us to 
call him back.  
  Can anyone out there give Greg some help?  If so please drop us a note if 
you are going to and another on how it went afterward.   Thanks, Eric&Barb
