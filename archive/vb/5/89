Subject: Re: [VB] First time non-greeting from ACVW

why dont you guys give this a rest.  i mean, hey i used to drive a baywindow
and  now i have my 65 on the road and drive that, but wave to everyone i see
driving a split, bay, vanagon, old beetle, ghia, 914, type 4, type 3,
harley, some ratty old pickup, whatever, who cares.  if they dont wave back
to you just dont wave to them again.  or you could follow them around, flag
them down, and give them your story about how "rude" they were not waving to
you and make sure they understand for the next time that its the hip thing
to do when you pass another bus.  does anyone here think that when a ford
escort driver doesnt wave to another ford escort driver,  he goes home all
sad and types that kind of crap into a computer and says to his buddies
"dude, i waved to this dude in an early model escort today, and guess what?
he didnt even wave back!"  now his buddies are all standing around with
their jaws on the floor and in disbelief.  i really dont think anyone in
this world is too good for the other.  some are friendly, some arent.
lastly kris, what does anyone have to be snooty about no matter what vehicle
they drive.
