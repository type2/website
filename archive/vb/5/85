I say pack it full, but nothing in the cap. I've done it that way for
years with good results. That's the idiot book technique - and I'm an
idiot. 8^)

Next time I do mine I'm using synthetic grease. I'm changing *all*
lubricants to synthetic.

You all might remember that I asked about tranny noise with synthetic
gear oil a few weeks ago. The update is: I put Redline MT-90 synthetic
gear oil in my tranny and then drove it on a 1600 mile round trip. The
MT-90 didn't have any effect on the slight gear noise at 50 mph, but it
did help with the shifting. I used to have a slight rake into second
when the tranny was warm. That's gone now.

Royal purple 20W-50 oil in the engine too. Seemed to keep temps about 10
degrees lower.
