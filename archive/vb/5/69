Subject: Starbucks please....I'll wait.

Hey John   Your not alone!!! I feel the 
same way.Most all the people I see in all the buses in
and around town wave back.There are a few salty types
that dont but I know who they are so I dont bother
with them anymore.Like you say they were in a bay
window...they most likely did not see you because they
were on their cell phone calling starbucks for a
double expresso latte jumbo whatever the heck it is
they call it.....Later and right back at ya pal!!!
(not counting your friend and you of course on that
phone joke)
