If I recall your first post, you're using a 009? From my experience with these
dizzies you only get around 17 degrees advance. With timing set (-at-)7.5 BTDC, your
total advance is only 24.5 degrees, a little retarded for best operation.

Set your timing at max. advance to 30 degrees BTDC and let idle fall where may.
When the 009 was developed, timing varied from 7.5 to 10 degrees BTDC.
