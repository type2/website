Subject: Buses On The River!  August 17-19

HOWDY!

Just a reminder - Buses On The River is NEXT WEEKEND! August 17-19!

We have received GREAT verbal reponse from a LOT of campers, thus far.  It looks like the turnout
is going to be even better than expected.

If you can plan on attending, and are interested in a group planned food menu, then SIGN UP for
the BREAKFAST BURRITOs (Sat. morn.) and the SUBMARINE SANDWICH and SALAD dinner (Sat. eve.). 
Check out the website, look for updates, and then email me, Travis. GoodOleVolk(-at-)yahoo.com   Just a
couple of people have signed up for food, and I have NOT made a page update becuse virtually ALL
food items are still left open.  If you have signed up - don't fret!  I've got your information
written down!

Check the website for updates, as they occur.  http://www.geocities.com/goodolevolk/busriver.html
The food page will be brought up to date as soon as I get some more postings.

Thanks to all,
Travis Adams

Hello ALL!

Upon the realization that there were no Full Moon Bus Club campouts during the month of August, in
the North Carolina and TN regions, your friendly, local TN members have been planning away! We've
spent many hours from many days finding a spot that we feel would be a suitable camping location
for this August and, hopefully, many Augusts to come. 

We feel that we have finally found just such a spot, and want to invite ANY and ALL to join us for
BUSES ON THE RIVER! 

We would like to invite ALL of our Full Moon buddies, our other club members (the Good Ole Volks),
as well as ANY other VW enthusiast to this event. 

We will be camping alongside the Nolichucky River, at the Nolichucky Gorge Campground in Erwin,
TN. This campground was built by many rafters, kayakers, and hikers hours of fruitful volunteer
efforts. It is positioned within one of the deepest gorges in the entire Southeast, and has great
water accessibility, not to mention literally bordering the National Forest and the Appalachian
Trail. All beverages and all dogs are WELCOME within the campground, so it will be perfect for us!
At only an hour's drive from Asheville and just 2 hours from Knoxville, it makes for the PERFECT
TENNESSEE camping experience! 

If you're into mountain biking, watersports, hiking, eating, fishing, or just plain doing nothing,
then this is the campout for you. The middle of August will be hot, but the water will be cool and
the pines that we will be camping under should provide with ample shade.  Experience August as it
ought to be experienced... with your VW friends, at the Buses On The River campout! 

Here's the website link... CHECK IT OUT!!  http://www.geocities.com/goodolevolk/busriver.html  The
Food list page is going to be updated repeatedly, as everyone confirms their spots.  We will be
doing a Breakfast Burrito meal for Saturday morning, and will be planning a Saturday evening meal,
as well.  Keep checking back to the page for updates!

For any questions, updates, or to sign up for the food list, and so on... don't be afraid to email
me, Travis Adams: GoodOleVolk(-at-)yahoo.com   or call (423) 230-0986 , or Richard Austin:
vwcoolbus(-at-)yahoo.com and (423) 245-1723.

We all look forward to seeing you,
