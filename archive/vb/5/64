Subject: Re: [VB] Timing and overheating question...

These temps sounds good, considering that it is freaking summer.  

It was hot here in W WA yesterday, and this is one of the coolest places in 
the country.  Your bus is not overheating at 200F   I like to keep my oil 
temp 210F or below- happy to be cruising the freeway on a hot day with 200 to 
210 oil temps.    Evidently 235 or 225 is the degrade temp for oil, 
particularly if you use multi weight, so you do not want it above 220.   I 
would make sure you engine compartment is sealed ie good engine to body seal, 
good engine lid seal, all the tin present and installed, including the 
underneath plates and the little  deflector plates to the rear of the 
cylinder. 

the oil light flickering at hot idles is not the best, but does happen.  
shouldn't with a new rebuild  What weight oil are you using- you may want to 
switch to a thicker oil.
