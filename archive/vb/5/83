Subject: Powdercoating colors?

I didn't see a conclusing come of Clara's adventure with powdercoating, so I 
wanted to put the question out on the table directly. Please flame away if 
this is obvious in the archives, but I checked and found little relavent 
content.

My question relates to the factory colors of the wheels and of the roof 
racks. From my research, I am only able to garner that the color most often 
used for roof racks is "Mercedes Silver" from DuPont. Whether that is 
correct has yet to be validated. The specific wheel color still eludes me.

I am able to draw from the palettes of DuPont, Tiger, Morton and Cardinal 
paints. My local shop has done quite a bit of work with the first two, but I 
wanted to know if any of you have tried colors from any of these companies 
and found them to be close enough to stock that a difference cannot be 
easily seen. I have been invited to come down and "pick one out", but I fear 
that my eye is not close enough for restoration work. I'm not trying to be a 
N*zi here, but don't want them to be so far off that it's obviously wrong...

Any input is greatly appreciated,
