Subject: [Q] Towing

  Bus pilots, please enlighten me with your wisdom...
Our last family camp out was at Rich Yost's for OCTO, 
our air matress blew out. We had to sleep in the cab, 
Lisa was 6 months pregnant at that time and although she 
didn't complain once, it is time to find a travel 
trailer. 
  We have have found one that weighs 1480# Do you think 
this is light enough? It is a pop up so wind drag is not 
as much an issue, I also have good brakes that could be 
supplemented by electric. Also as a comparison, does 
anyone know what a Puck weighs and how it pulls(I know 
several list members have experience with them)?
  The double cab has a 1776 w/ dual carbs and a 4.125 
R&P.

Thanks!
