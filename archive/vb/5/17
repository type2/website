How many you want, any paticular serial number. I have at least 20 in my
junk pile out back and another dozen or so in the shop and/or warehouse!

after tearing apart the 40hp from my panel today, i found the case to be
destroyed internally. anyone have a good/useable one they'd like to get rid
of? my only request is that it is good/useable, preferably at standard but
needing line bore ok, not warped. i do not need head studs or any other
case-associated parts. i'd also really like the numbers to be in the
5970000-6400000 range, but i won't complain if it's not. help me get my bus
back on the road (it's only been about 30 years).
