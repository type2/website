My wife, Liz, isn't as hearty as us bus drivers, so we're driving the '99 =
Ho*da with the AC to the coast Friday. It'll be 104 here today.=20

Speaking of the DC, I drove it a few miles the body guy's shop yesterday =
to check on the 21w progress, then stopped in for a pint or two at the =
local. On the way home from there it died! Had to push it a long block to =
the driveway. It's burning ignition fuses for some reason. I replaced the =
pertronic dizzy module this morning, no-go. Will replace the pertronix =
coil tonight. Had to pedal my ass to work, 3 miles.=20

I'll look at the seat back from my '65 deluxe that's in the rafters =
tonight. I think they are plastic half-spheres with a chrome/silver =
finish. Maybe the list knows if they're repro'd. Somebody with a lathe =
could turn 'em easily from billit. My father-in-law has a huge industrial =
one that must have a 10' yawn to work on ag pumps.=20

Hi   I was just looking at some pictures on the Type 2
site.You say you are driving a Honda? where is the DC?
Hey do you know if there are any aluminum "caps" or
whatever that go on the ends of the backseat aluminum
rail in my 67 deluxe?  Later...
