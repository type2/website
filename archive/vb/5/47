Subject: Re: Leaky tranny

  Hi Diana,
 I had a similar problem, I think we all did!  Mine was on a rebuilt =
tranny that leaked, when I took
the flanged cover off I used brake cleaner on just the one side, =
flange-to-gasket.  The=20
gasket was held fast to the tranny.  I used the red silly AND waited =
24hrs for it to dry.
The next day when I refilled it, it did leak :-(  I took it apart again =
and found the
gasket had stuck to the flange and came off of the tranny!  I repeated =
the procedure,
gasket-to-tranny this time and again waited 24hrs, PERFECT!  No leak! =20
Make sure you clean it perfectly and you must wait 'til the silicone =
dries.
 Hope that helped,
