Subject: Safari/Popout assembly trick


Here's a trick I figured out for assembling safaris or popouts. I used 5/8" aluminum channel, 
which I bought (-at-) the hardware store, along with 2 woodworking clamps, which I already had. 
The channel distributes the force along the entire lenght of the frame, making it easier 
to pull together. The cost of the aluminum was ~$4.00
