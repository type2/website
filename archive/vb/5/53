Subject: repop pieces for a middle seat.

I figured I would separate this into its own message. I am looking for
someone that has a early to mid 60's middle seat with a chrome ended grab
handle. I would like to borrow /rent / buy one end chrome piece and the
middle piece. I want to reproduce these items for myself and a few others. I
can make molds of your pieces without damaging them and return them to you
within a few days. who ever loans me the pieces will get first dibs on
getting / repping them for resale.

In regard to the question about the end caps on the chrome rear seat bar, my
deluxe (63) had plastic end caps.
