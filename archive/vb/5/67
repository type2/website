ya- I got calls from both the people you did Eric.   The folks from Canada by 
the side of the road did not seem interested in much self diagnosis, asked 
for a shop- I told them Oval's was in the area.  

  David from Lousiana is in Oly with his 77which had got hot between Portland 
and Oly and is making a strange noise  whistle/chip which may by a loose head 
(1/2 side) or an exhaust whistle- one of the studs holding the manifold on 
under the head stripped out.
