Hi all,

I hope we see a lot of listees at FamilienFest 7. Remember, this=
 
annual show is put on by Strictly Vintage 2s, so we're VERY bus 
friendly! This is one of the few shows that's on grass and under=
 
trees, so it's actually a pleasant day!

Bring the kids because we have a whole area for them to play in.=
 We 
even supply the supervision, so you can troll the swap meet 
guilt-free!

More details are here:

1

See you there!

Scott
