Subject: Oregon Scouting!

Greetings, List!

I am now printing the Northern CA and Oregon AIRS lists, and wondering
whether to put that 34 PICT back on or wait until tomorrow to get one of
those adapters so I can put a 30/31 PICT on that dp 1776, and whether I
should replace the dual-vacuum dizzy with a 009 or a straight vacuum advance
dizzy....(I've got a 30/31 and 009 on my doublecab dp 1600, and I love it!)

We're heading up to Oregon (Eugene vicinity) on Friday, putz around on
Saturday, and back home Sunday.  Our mission is to see whether we want to
move up there, and we're gonna be looking at things (properties) between
Blue River, Noti, Cheshire, etc.

One of our requisites is that there's plenty of space/shelter for geriatric
Volkswagens!

So!  If anyone sees a '66 green and white hardtop Westy with maroon paisley
curtains putting around, give us a honk or wave!

And if you want to see how much I trust this engine that I put in last
weekend, look at this:  www.sonic.net/~mizamook/Gauges.htm
I've got one of those external oil coolers with fan (switch to left of
speedo pod), and a System 1 filter.  I've never seen such clean oil in a VW!
That, coupled with a doghouse cooler (no Hoover bit yet...I finally
understand it, so soon, I will get or fab one!), I should be unable to
overheat this engine!

I didn't cut holes to do that, by the way!

Later!

Gene
