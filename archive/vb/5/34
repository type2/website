Hi all we did the 125 mi one way trip to check out the 59 dc just
because we are in washington for a while, sorry we did not take any pics
and the dc was beyond our work efforts and time but better start as some
we have seen.  we did get the phone number 360-249-4289 and address,
2810 Simpson Ave, Hoquiam, hope this helps anyone out there.
