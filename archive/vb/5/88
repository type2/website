A bug fourth with a 3.88 will be more or less indistinguishable from a bus
fourth with the stock R/P on a small nut tranny. If you really have a bug
tranny, you are more than likely over-revving at 60 to 65. On my old 63, I
put a bug center section in because it was close to hand during a time of
need, and my highway speed dropped about 6 at the same rpm's to 55 max.
Fourth gear only, it didn't affect the other gears much. If you like 5000
rpm's as a max, disregard this message.
