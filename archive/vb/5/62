not if you want to be able to shift in/out of all gears

however I found the other day a system where a bug nosecone/hockey stick was 
installed in a splitty.  It involved a homemade adaptor plate, and modifying 
the rear shift rod.   The adaptor plate et al has to be done precisly, or the 
thing wont work right
