Garrett,
  200 deg. F. is not too hot, get worried above 230. The oil needs to get
above 212 just to drive out the water vapor. It does sound like your timing
is a little advanced, 28-30 deg. max advance seems to be the accepted
figure. Reset your idle timing to 7.5 deg. BTDC, you'll end up just about
perfect.
