Subject: 1776 update

Greetings Honorable Bus List Members:

I have a 1776 update. Well, we won the war (little joke). I now have over
3,000 miles on my new Ronnie OldVolks installed 1776 with gearing upgrade in
my 1967 21 DLX. Took the bus over to Ronnie for an inspection to make sure
all is going well. No tight valves, no pushrod tube bluing and running like
a champ! The big deal is that I too live in the desert, 100+ temps, and
drive a long 17 mile grade from Palm Springs to Yucca Valley via hwy 62.
Folks, this situation is no easy "pass" for the 1776. Add three kids and a
wife to the load, and you can see why I'm stoked.

Being relatively new to the VW experience, I also had the opportunity at
Ronnie's shop to ask a lot of questions regarding maintenance and procedures
on the upkeep of my bus. Ronnie was very helpful as I taped his experience
and know how. Thanks Ronnie.

The bus is ready for my trip to Black Rock Desert, NV, later this month. I
will give a report to the list on my bus adventures. Ronnie is putting
together a "Road Kit" for my bus for any problems that may arise. Friends,
life is good!!

Cordially,

Hart Ponder
