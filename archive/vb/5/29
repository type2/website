Subject: Re:[VB] [Q] Towing >Puck Stats<

Puck vitals as of 1968-71~ish models are:
Weight: 660 lbs. <dry unloaded>
Tongue wt: 73lbs.

Note: later larger models exist. '68-'71 is an
estimation based on limited exposure to total history
of Hymer/Eriba products. Puck is only one model.

Impressions/experiences:
<A.>
As towed with our '67 Westfalia, 1776, dual Delortto
40's, with full-flowed oiling system including 60-pass
Mesa brand oil cooler with manually operated electic
fan. General towing environment = SW USA.
* Overall favorable experiences, a little light in the
suspension via lever shocks and occassionally scarey
going over bridges/bumps.
* Mostly transparent at highway speed. =) !
* Actually sometimes seems to "smooth out" the ride.
* Some evidence of some minor strain on bus brakes.
Best to ensure top condition of bus brake sys prior to
towing.
* Place more weight/equipment in bus rather than in
trailer.

<B.> As towed by Ford Explorer
Inlaws about scared the s out of us by hauling buns
and making non-ginger lane changes.
<C.> As towed by Ford F150
No problems. Actually seems more aerodynamically happy
due to wider towing vehicle.

Recommendation:
Yes, pursue trailers. Can be fun. Can be a PITA.
Calculate numbers of persons, amt. of equipment, type
of terrain to be traveled <hills?> <highwinds?>
<rain/snow etc.> <extreme heat?>
Be careful not to over tax the cooling system and
brakes. Consider rooftop tents

Alternatives:
Rear hatch extension type tents...
