Subject: Yukky idle/34PICT/050 dizzy

Help!

I was unsuccessful in the change from the 34PICT to the 30/31 due to lack of
jets and adapter, and the single diaphragm dizzy I had wouldn't retard
enough (vacuum can hit my pressure sender), the 009 looked backwards, so
here I am still using this dual diaphragm 050 thing.

Questions:  What should I set my timing to with stock crank and cam?

How do I make this loping/rough/unsteady/oscillating idle go away?  I read
all I could on setting up the 34, but it doesn't seem to be helping.

Thanks!

Gene
