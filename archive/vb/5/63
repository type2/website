actually there is a certain torque they should be tightened to.  Too tight is 
bad- as the plate there can flex if you do that.

I would soak the area with simple green, wait an hour or so, then take the 
bus to the car wash.  Idea being that you will be able to see where the leak 
is coming from.

how much does it leak?   I once had a bus with a tranny I kept topping up, 
but the tranny ended up dying.

if it is dripping from the nose cone to tranny case seam, or the nose cone, 
the trtanny would have to be pulled to fix it- and reseal the mating area/ 
replace the front nose cone seal as it needs.   Since that is so much work to 
get to that leak, I would definately weigh how much it leaks versus a good 
time to do it, but with a trip coming up good idea to sortit out
