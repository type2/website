I think I would be more concerned with building an intake/exhaust snorkel first! There's a book alled something like "Baja's and Buggies" it's an older book that has a bunch of tips in it. From what I remember silicon is the king! You put it over all of your connections. They used to make waterproof caps too, I bet someone still does....    Sean65 Westfalia
