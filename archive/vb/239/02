I need help with my memory! When I restored my '67 I used Wolfsburg West, 
Mill Auto Supply, and someone else for body replacement metal. I can't 
remember the other supplier, but that's where I thing I got replacement 
windshield frame pieces. I have some extra corner pieces left over but I 
think I'm going to need an entire frame.

Thanks
Jerry
