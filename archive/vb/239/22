To fix this, pull out the brass tube, clean the fitting and the hole
very well with carb cleaner and make sure that they are dry.  With a flat
file, roll the brass tube (just the part that goes inside the pump or
carb)against a flat surface to put some knurl in the tube.  Mix up some
fuel-proof epoxy (JB-Weld) and apply a small amount to the knurled area of
the tube.  Tap the tube back into place and allow a full day for curing
before putting it back into service.

Some folks like to safety wire the hose clamp to the carb or fuel pump to
be sure!
