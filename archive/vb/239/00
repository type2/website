Subject: Re: Shortening torsion bars

Hello Everyone

 

            Has anyone had the experience in shortening torsion bars for
a narrowed bus beam?  What I am wondering is if it would be safe to cut
them with a miter saw with a metal blade or something of that type or
take it to someone with a hydraulic metal cutter.

 

 

Any thoughts,

Eric Lykens
