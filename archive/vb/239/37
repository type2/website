Subject: Re: [VB] How do you convert a 65' from 6volt to 12 volt ?

One thing I've found on the Bus's that I've converted to 12 volts, is the 6V
signal relays work fine. Don't blink fast, and don't blink slow. Done this
with a 64 and a 66 bus, and have seen no long term issues.

Lot easier than trying to find a 67 only signal box.  :-)
