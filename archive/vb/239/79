Ya, ya, whatever your math says.   feel free to visit we'll go for a drive.  
It even has a tach these days.   It really shocked Eric of VeeWee111 when he 
convinced me to temp'ly hook up his tach (some years ago), as he was sure I 
was overrevving it, as I said 58 was that bus' sweet spot.  well 58 was 3K by 
his tach

oh, and it has a .82 4th gear, not a .89 4th.

 Assuming a stock .89 4th, that would actually put you at 48mph at 3000rpm,
 56mph at 3500, and 64mph at 4000rpm.
 
 Even with a .82 4th you would still be at 52mph at 3000rpm, 60.5mph at 3500,
 and 69mph at 4000rpm.
