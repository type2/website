 It needs to remain stock height, and I'd prefer to keep the crash box in
 there.  Would one want to change the tranny gear ratios or is it
 possible to change the gear ratio in the redux boxes?   Hmmmm, could you
 some how flip the gear ratios in the "redux" boxes so you get a
 "multiplication" box?

the crash box tranny had no synchros at all, and was used in a bus through 
early 53

the partly synchronised split case tranny was used through mid may 59.  You 
dont get synchros for 1st or reverse, so come to a full and complete stop 
before shifting into those gears (lest you want grinding)

I think it is geared to go about 50 at 3500 rpms (if you tach it and let us 
know really what it is that'd be great!!!!   this is with the original rgears.

to gear it higher you can swap on later Rgear boxes- the 64-67 big nuts or 
the 63 1 ton 36mm nut versions   unless you use the smaller 63 & back brake 
shoes (or swap to later front brakes) you get wierd front to back braking 
ratios.  you can use the 55-63 drums with the 1 ton 63 1.26 RGears, with a 
fat washer under the axle nut.  (BTDT)

You can just swap over the boxes and tubes w/o changing the axle shafts, but 
i'd remove them and inspect teh spades and fulcrum plates.  This can be done 
w/tranny in bus, if bus is blocked safely and on sturdy stands.

the split case r&p is slightly higher than a 4.38 but I dont remmeber the 
numbers offhand.  should be in the online parst list

with the early 64 gearing in my 61 (4.38 r&p, big nut 1.26 boxes and 15" rims 
205 75 15 tires) I get 3K in 4th at 58 mph, and 3500rpms gives 68mph.  It has 
plenty oomph to pull hills and get to speed with a 1600.  

I don't think there are alternate r/ps for a split case, I don't believe the 
later ones fit.
