 Probably not a really late '63.  I had one from July and I think the VIN was 
1139075.  I'll guess that maybe his number is April or May?

well, seeing as the model year changed at VIN 1 144 303, on Aug 5 1963
 I'd say anything buildt within 2 or 3 months before that is a late 63.   
A sept 63 buildt bus would be a 64 model

I have a note of a 25th May buildt bus VIN 1 117 418.   I'd guess his bus was 
buildt late May 63.

So, what's the birthday?  it's the top line of the m code tag behind the seat.

day .. month    (year isn't listed on top line)  is it 

29 05  ?
