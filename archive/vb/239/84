Subject: Re: [VB] why i drive 'em (friday-shortish)

oh ya, i forgot one, my eighth vw is a 65 standard. i paid $400 for it, i 
had to remove lots of 3/4 " plywood, a gm four cylander water cooled 
engine, a radiator, 2 fans, lots of crappy cheap carpet, a couple buick 
seats and a whole bunch of expandofoam. what i have left is a pretty solid 
driver potential that is awaiting surgery. a new engine, some new divider 
walls (walk-through), a new rear cargo section...a few seats and we're 
back on the road! i can't wait! it's going to replace my 66 beetle as my 
daily driver, soon i hope...
