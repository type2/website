Hi Hapybus,
Behind the front passenger seat should be a Mcode plate, left front of engine 
compartment should be an ID and data plate.  These two plates an be unscrewed 
and replaced so checking the chassi number of these two plates with the 
stamped into the body ID # between the right side of the engine and the 
battery pan is a MUST!
