Nice looking bus! Looking at the pic of the engine I can make a few suggestions.  First, I would give it a good steam clean. It makes it a much better experience to work on and if you do have any leaks thay will be easy to spot. Secondly, I would put on an air cleaner. A stock one would be best because it also has the preheater tube and will plug the hole in your tin. It also has aplace to attach a hose from it to the oil filler stand so that you don't get oil blown all over the place. Have you experienced problems with it icing up? That along with making sure your heat risers are clean can make a big difference in how your bus runs. I would also relocate the fuel filter. If for any reason anything bad happens you are going to get gas on your coil. Not a good time.
