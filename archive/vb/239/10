  $12k for the "New Bus"?? Yeah right! We just turned in our New Beetle and 
were looking to get a Eurovan, but they're $27,000 for the plain vanilla GL, a 
lot more if you want the Winnebago camping package. Even a used 2001 goes for 
$19,000 if you can find one. With the kitsch of the New Bus I bet it stickers 
for $30,000+, then add the outragious mark-up the dealers are going to tack 
on.   Did you see my post that mentioned VW's new SUV topping out at around $60 
grand? They are definitely moving up-market and don't want the vintage bus 
crowd dragging down their marketing efforts with the hippie image a vintage bus 
stubbornly conveys.  
  I said bye-bye to VW and although I knew it wouldn't do any good, I let them 
know their policies towards vintage enthusiasts drove me to find another 
marque. My other car is now a 2002 Dodge Grand Caravan. Newer, lower mileage,  
several grand cheaper than the closest (older) Eurovan...and I no longer write 
checks to a company that seems set on destroying my hobby.

It is going to be really cool when the prices on Splitties gets up to
$12,000.00 and VW starts making new Splitties again in that $12K market
price.
