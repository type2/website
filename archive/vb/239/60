Subject: RE: [VB] How do you convert a 65' from 6volt to 12 volt ?

Another vote for Clara's approach.  Two of my three buses are 6V and
everything works fine.  They even start at -20F as long as the battery
is up to snuff.  My only compaint has been the windshield wiper speed.
An application of RainX takes care of that problem.

is there something wrong with the 6V?  I've had 6V work fine.   dont fix it
if it ain't broke.
