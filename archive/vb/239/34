Subject: Re: [VB] How do you convert a 65' from 6volt to 12 volt ?

No kit,
there are lists in the archives about how to change all the pieces.

is there something wrong with the 6V?  I've had 6V work fine.   dont fix it 
if it ain't broke.

Any all VW with grounding issues could use a bit of cleaning at the battery 
terminals, grounds.  12V or 6V

Can I have all your good 6V stuff if you swap over?
