6V will power regular stuff that is designed to run on 6V (tricky that)

you can get power inverters to convert 6V to 12V for modern radios and such

of course you need a 6V battery to run your 6V car.  Like you need a 12V 
battery to run your 12V car.  Like in a 12V car you need light bulbs designed 
for 12V.  for a 6V car you need ones that say 6V.   They sell 6V bulbs at 
your local Schucks/Kragens/Checkers.

It was great when I got my 59 truck I stripped ALL the 12V stuff out of it 
and traded it, got all the 6V stuff including 40hp motor from a 62? bug that 
was being converted to 12V/1600.   So I converted the truck back to 6V.  I'm 
doing that again with my 'new' beater 63 truck.   Besides, I have loads of 6V 
dash light bulbs, and no spare 12V ones, and the dash light bulbs are not 
sold anywhere locally.

Anyone know of a source for coloured dash light bulbs?   I have a yen for red 
ones for the guages in my 61, to match the dash.  Do you think it'll work if 
I paint the bulbs?
