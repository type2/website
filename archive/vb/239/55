Subject: I'm Back...  (Dan Howard)

Sorry for wasting the bandwidth but I must say that I am back.  Anyone that
wishes to contact me can do so at this email addy.  But, I am back in the VW's
now after a stint in the music biz.  I help run a record label called Shitty Ass
Records and it's going well.

I hope to be up and running by next month with a bus again.

I've missed you all and haven't been on the list in probably 2 years or so.  :(

Hello, Matt and Katie, Thom, Clara and crew, Ronnie, John, MetWiz, Everett, John
H., etc...
