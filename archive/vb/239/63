POR Sticks best to roughed up metal, lightly rusted metal, or preferably,
to bared metal that has been properly treated with the blue phosphating
solution sold by POR or a good body shop supply house. The solution is
kept on the bared metal for a half hour then rinsed with water til clean.
Then air dried, and then POR'd.
