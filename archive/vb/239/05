trivia of the day:   double ended screwdrivers were put in VW tools kits  for 
buses as of VIN 1 080 215 on 7th mar 63.   Before that they got two 
screwdrivers. 

 does your bus have a period correct tool kit? ha ha what is one anyway?  I 
like those double ended VW screwdrivers, they are the best for pop out screws.

I've been more interested in original VW tools , finding them useful.  The I 
like th spark plug/ gen nut/oil plug wrench.  I recently found a different 
version of the sprak plug wrench, longer with a smaller turn bar.   seems 
useful, I'll try it at my next tune up.
