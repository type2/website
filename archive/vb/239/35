Subject: 'go fast' crash box

Hi All,

 

What's the best way to go faster than 60 mph in a pre may 19, 1959 bus?
It needs to remain stock height, and I'd prefer to keep the crash box in
there.  Would one want to change the tranny gear ratios or is it
possible to change the gear ratio in the redux boxes?   Hmmmm, could you
some how flip the gear ratios in the "redux" boxes so you get a
"multiplication" box?

 

Reasoning:  The firebus has the og transaxle and a 1500 motor. since
this is a vehicle intended for driving purposes and it doesn't have the
og motor, I plan to keep the motor that is there now or possibly do
something a bit more fun for the propulsion system. problem is now, it's
whining pretty good at 60 mph with lots of power to spare.  "Gotta get
to the fire FAST" :-)

 

Thoughts?

 

 

David
