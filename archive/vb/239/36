The new Honda-thingies are starting to pop up in the parking lot
here (-at-) work; they seem to be popular with the younger crowd, who
also tend to not have scads of extra cash laying around.

I think VW was a day late and several thousand dollars over on this one.

They were first to market (duh!) with the New Beetle, but the
retro concept was still fresh back then, and we were in boom times.
I know a couple who paid $31k (I even got to see the original window
sticker!) for a New Beetle, just so they could be the first on the 
block with one.

Now the retro thing is getting old, now that every other car maker
seems to be in the game.  You even have one car maker doing a retro
of another marque's model (BMW Mini)
