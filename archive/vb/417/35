Hi Kevin,
	I would have thought that L87 would be easy to match or at least get  
close to?  I have a '66 westy that is mostly og L87 and it is a great  
color.  Where it has faded it has become lighter and whiter.  Some of  
the more expensive waxes seem to bring the color back.  L87 is not a  
yellowy creme but more of a greyish creme.  Gary Gibson
