  pass along some really sad news:  Uncle Jerry passed away around 2:30 
this afternoon (Sunday).  Most of you know he has been pretty close to it 
for some time now.  Melissa, his Magoo, is in a bit of a state of shock at 
the moment,  and I'm sure could really use the VW community's support and 
prayers.  Thee really isn't a whole lot else I can say right now other 
than life goes on and we really need to live it the best we can.  I'm sure 
more info will be coming in the next few days, but that's all I got for 
now.

We are saddened by UJ's passing.  UJ was an asset to the VW community that 
cannot be replaced..  He will be fondly remembered by all who knew him.

Our thought go out to Melissa as well.  She was UJ's strong foundation 
through many trials.
