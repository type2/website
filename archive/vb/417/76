Subject: Re: [VB] big hole in tin - newer air cleaner on an older bus?

Yes, the 2" hole is for the air cleaner pre-heat on a 68 -71 bus or a 68 & later beetle.
here's a 68 bus:

No, you do NOT want to use that air cleaner on your splitty.? 

Split buses (and 67 and earlier beetles) used a 38 mm hole for the 1" pre-heat tube.

pre-heat takes warm air and feeds it into the carb.?? This works against carb? icing.? carb icing happens when the fuel is vaporised in the carb, which drops the temp and then water condenses on the carb and intake.?? It makes the engien runs funky and often stall at lights.??This is an issue below? about 60F, though I've seen icing happen with temps in the mid 60s.?? When the temps are generally above 70F, the pre-heat counterweight flap should be propped open, as it does make the engine run warmer, which you don't want when it's 85F out.?? I call that summer position.?? 
Here in WA WA pre heat is important about 9-10 months of the year.

The tin between crank and pulley changed as well at 68.?With mismatched tin it doesn't fit right, or has gaps.

Here is a set of tin for a 1500 '63 truck with?doghouse?oil cooler?:

here's where the 1" pre-heat pipe connects at the lower end:
