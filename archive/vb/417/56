Subject: wiring issues ...

So ... on my 60 .. the driver side brake light doesn't work ... if I turn my
headlights on .. then the tail lights work .. if I signal both signal lights
work .. I was wondering ... couldn't I just run a wire from the passenger
side brake light to the driver's side brake light ... or would that work?


TIA
