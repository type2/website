Subject: bad paint...

Well the bus was painted last week...unknown to me. I thought my guy was
still trying to find someone to paint it, and if he painted it-I was going
to pick up the paint.

He had some time so he picked up the paint, and painted it.

The color is way off! And the paint job pretty much sucks. He realizes this,
and we are trying to figure out what to do. He is a decent guy, and it is
hard to get too pissed off at him, but I'm pretty pissed.

He says he is going to contact his supplier to find out why the paint color
was not right. Then I am going to find someone else to paint it. Any
suggestions to make sure they mix it correctly? I have heard about paint
colors not being correct, but I thought if you had the right code - L87,
pearl white, it should be mixed correctly. Is there more mixing info that I
need?

I am meeting with him tonight to try to figure out how to resolve this.
