On further inspection, it appears that the stub axle is bent at an downward 
angle.  This caused the inside of the drum to rub against the backing plate, 
bending it, and eventually causing enough friction that it caused the
drum to shear (???).  

Odd.  I'm kind of at a loss.  I suspect the stub axle bearings are toast?

Hmm...
