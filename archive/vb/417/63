Subject: Re: [VB] rubber thing ...

??????????????
I got a delivery, but no rubber thing. Does it fit into the concave bit of 
the sheet metal at the floor?

jdd Said,
Anyone know a source for that rubber thing that goes below the spare tire
hump above the cargo floor .. on tghe cargo side of the bulkhead ... just
above the floor .. sort of a concave thing .. the width of the bus and maybe
9" tall .. I'm sure everyone knows the thing I'm referring too ...
