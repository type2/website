Subject: steering column

Yep, digin' a hole isn't my first choice. I removed mine once by jacking up
the front, installing blocks under the wheels, putting the jack on a block
and then jacking the bus higher still and so on until I could get the column
out. Maybe the hole idea isn't so bad in retrospect. All the jacking and
blocking took me quite a while. Maybe a combination of the two??

Once again, Cheers,
Chris
