Subject: Lowered Front Ends

I have a chance to update my front end on my 61 crew cab.  I would like to
hear from people with air bags and/or narrowed beams, mostly in regards to
ride and handling quality.

I have used the Albatross adjusters in the past and I'm fine with that ride
quality and adjustability.  If there happens to be something better, I'll
have a look at it.

How's the ride/handling with air bags?

How's the ride/handling with a narrowed beam?

How's the ride/handling with both?

The PO decided to notch the frame to install a stock ball joint beam.  To
make matters worse, they welded it in!  I just found a frame section to
repair it, but I still want it lowered!  And preferably adjustable.

Thanks,


Rennie
