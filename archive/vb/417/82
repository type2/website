Subject: Re: [VB] big hole in tin - newer air cleaner on an older bus?

For some reason question marks are added some where in the email world
I didn't put them in, so yes this is a statement , not a question.?? :)
please ignore them.? I don't know where they came from or why they showed up.

No, you do not want to use a bay air cleaner in your splitty.?
a 40hp or 1500 bus air cleaner is fine on a 1600.?

The tin with the 2" hole is later?.

Many people do not understand pre-heat.?

Yes, the old rubber seal gets old and can be missing.
that was not the gap between the tin that I was talking about.?
? The one I was talking about is causing by mismatched tin.

Regards, Clara

Is this a question or a comment?  I agree that I'd prefer to not use a later 
air cleaner, but since the bus has replacement motor I think I should fit an 
appropriate air cleaner.  If I track down an engine that would have been in a 
bus produced Sept 1962 I'll think about replacing the replacement ;)

tube.

My Dad who's housing the bus at the moment measured the pre-heat tube hole in 
the engine tin at 2", so it seems like it has a newer tin that doesn't accept 
the 1" style pre-heat tube.

icing.?

Great description, but I have a hard time understanding if you are making 
statements or asking questions.  It seems like statements.

> The tin between crank and pulley changed as well at 68.?With mismatched tin it 

doesn't fit right, or has gaps.

Yeah the engine tin is missing the seal that goes around it and I'm wondering 
if the original seal fell out due a possibly larger gap.  I'll try a normal 
seal and if that doesn't work then I'll improvise one that will.

All the best,
Elliott
