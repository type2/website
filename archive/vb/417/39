Subject: pearl white, blizzard white, polar white...& color sanding

Well I was at my body shop place today.

He had some chips from his paint supplier for me to compare to the paint on
the bus. For reference sake-my bus had a L87 Pearl Weiss sticker on it.

I took some pics of the chips next to my bus, showing the original paint and
the paint he applied. I understand why a few of you have said that Pearl
White is a cold color-it is in the paint chip, but not on my bus. His paint
color does not really match Pearl White, but the Pearl White Paint chip does
not really match the original paint either. It looks like Blizzard White
actually matches the closest to the original paint. 

In my mind Polar White matches the best - ie if someone just showed me paint
chips, I would pick Polar White as the color of my bus. I think I like this
one the best too.

I have posted some pics on the samba, please check them out, and let me know
what you think. Look for photos from kguarnotta.

As my body guy is in agreement that the color is not right, it will be
painted again. I just need to pick the color. 

PS - Could someone direct me to info on color sanding? I can't find it in
the library.

Thanks,

-Kevin
