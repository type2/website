Kevin, 
Whats wrong with the paint specifically? What brand paint? What kind ( acryllic etc ) Did they match with color code or what? For the PPG paints you have to tell them not just the factor code but the PPG code ( look it up on thesamba.com under technical ). Dupont can cross match from the PPG code. 
You can most likely scuff it and repaint. 

This happens alot more than you think, I have heard about people redoing things for improperly matched paint, etc. 

On my bus, I painted the doors first ( they were taken off ). This allowed me to check things out. I used Dupont for the pearly white top, slightly more yellowish than I imagined but it looks good, I repainted a few areas inside and it matched the original paint well
