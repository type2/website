Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Uncle Jerry

This is truly gonna be a year to remember. So far I've lost a good  
friend to cancer and now Jerry.

If Melissa is still reading this, please know that the prayers of  
myself and my boy Jake will be with you. Just know that God is good  
and that Jerry is in a land where the temperature is always nice,  
there is no rust, the scenery and adventures are endless and the only  
reason you need to pull over is to share a story with a fellow  
traveler exploring Heaven's splendor.

Take care and if you need anything please let me know.
