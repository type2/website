Subject: newer air cleaner on an older bus?

Hello,

I've got a 63 panel with a replaced engine and I wrote the list a few weeks 
ago about identifying the engine.  The bus runs, but it's missing it's air 
cleaner, so I haven't really been running it until I find a replacement, so I'm 
writing here to get some advice.

Firstly I'm interested in an oil bath cleaner rather than an air filter, but if 
someone can make a good case for the air filter I might go that direction as it 
seems like I can actually buy new air filter setups as opposed to the lack of 
reproduction air cleaners.

Does the air cleaner actually attach to the roof of the engine compartment?  
I've seen pictures of air cleaners with a bracket attached to it:

In the roof of my engine compartment I only see a bar that runs the entire 
width above the carb.  Would the air cleaner attach there?

The engine is newer (both in age and in style), so it would require a later 
model air cleaner (I'm guessing a 68-70) model.  Would it be a problem hanging 
a newer air cleaner in my older bus?  A newer one will hang on the right side 
of the engine compartment, while mine originally hung to the left.  Would it 
be possible to mix and match a left hanging duct with a newer air cleaner to 
hang it on the left side?

Any other advice about the subject is welcome.

Cheers,
Elliott
