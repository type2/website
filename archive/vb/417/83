Subject: Re: [VB] newer air cleaner on an older bus? - mounting air

I put a 40hp air cleaner on the engine in my 61 bus.
The air cleaner is newer than the bus, but older than the 1600 engine.
It works great. I put about 50k on it.
I am using an aircleaner from a fresh air 40hp bus, with the pre-heat flap and pipe, and the breather hose spout on the side.

There is a triangular bracket under the coil that the air cleaner arm bolts to
There is an arm that goes to the front of the shroud for extra bracing, but that is harder to find and you can run without it.

Since the 1600 is a little wider than the 40hp the bracket was made for,?the upper bolt hole?in the triangle and the bolt hole in the air cleaner arm don't?quite line up. ?I had to?use a little?adaptor piece to fit it together on a 1600.?

Just one observation. The original post issue about the air cleaner
being mounted to the body was never addressed.

The engine needs to be free to vibrate and twist, so nothing that is
hard-attached to the engine can be secured to the body.

 the newer engine was going to need a new air cleaner.
