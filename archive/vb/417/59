John -

Nope,  That's because the Turn and Stop Lights are controlled at the Turn
Signal Switch to operate correctly when the switch is at rest or operating.
Even though the Left Turn Signal is working and the Stop Light is not,
sounds like the contacts are dirty or possible coming loose not allowing the
Stoplight circuit to complete with the switch off or in the Right Turn
Signal position.

Does the Left Stoplight work when the Right Turn Signal is on?  If yes, the
contact in the switch is moving around.  If not, then the contact is
probably broken off and/or coming apart.

This becomes a common problem for aging and similarly designed Bus Turn
Signal Switches up through 1971.  A very similar switch is used on 56-59
Beetles, the Bus one just has a different lever and housing.
