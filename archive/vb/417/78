The bay aircleaner is HUGE, and really won't fit well in your engine 
compartment.  In addition, it "sits" on a welded on platform in the engine 
bay...

There's no reason to use the later aircleaner, it doesn't flow any more 
air than the early one.   Unless you're using a >1800cc engine, in which 
case you're not using a stock carb, so the discussion is pointless. ;)

Use your stock aircleaner because it actually fits the engine bay.   Or 
not, it's your bus.  That's a recommendation, not a question or statement. 
:)   If you don't have one, locate one and use it.   Locate the rear (RIR) 
tin and pulley tin that's appropriate as well.

The original seal probably dried up and fell apart during someones engine 
r&r and was never replaced.   they don't "fall out" since they are T 
shaped, with the top of the T slid into a slot around the engine bay...
