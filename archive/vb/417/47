Subject: shop-line vs DCC paints

I think I see what may be part of the problem. I noticed his paint can says
Shop-line on it, instead of DCC Concept paint. I think he got the wrong type
of paint. I will speak with the store he got the paint from Thursday, or
call PPG.

I think the Shop-line is the cheap stuff, and I told him specifically I
wanted to use DCC Concept.
