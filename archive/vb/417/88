Great trip report.?? Sorry it ended in a tow.

I've heard things about the new brazialian drums that make me think they are not of the greatest quality.
I've heard of them spinning, where the splines on the inside go.?? That sounds like what happened to you.
It probably had been starting to happen for a while, and the noise you had been hearing was the drum getting sloppy on the splines of the stub axle.
Since Greg picked up calipers for measuring the insides of drums, it seems that good og 64-67 drums within spec are not all that easy to find.

If the splines on the stub axle are good, just get a replacement drum
I think lowered buses tend to have more issues with spinning drums.?? Pretty rare for a RGB bus with German drums.?
