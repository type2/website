Subject: jack placement

Howdy,
I was at the Litchfield Bug Fest this past weekend in Connecticut
& picked up a jack for my 1963 California Camper.
I've had the bus since 1978 & it has never had a jack.
it has a bench seat.
My question is, where is it stored?
is it supposed to go with the spare tire, behind the seat, somehow?
There is nothing to secure it back there.
a pic would be great.
thanks,
 Bill G
