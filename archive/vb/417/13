Thanks for all your responses, I will take a closer look at mine, and how it
interacts with my gear shift lever.

I examined the hand brake on my 15 window '63 walk-thru bus.
Also looked at the gear shift lever. First the gear shift lever in nuetral 
has a small amount of play or slop if you will. It can be one or two degrees
off from vertical left or right with the bus parked. Depending on what
position you left it in when you last shut your bus down.

The hand brake in my bus sits perhaps one or two degree's from vertical
leaning to the right. With the lock button depressed and moving the handle
foreward and aft, it tracks straight, maintaining the same angle from
vertical, a constant one or two degree's to the right.

I agree with Clara. I believe the small tilt of the hand brake lever is a 
design function to
allow some clearance around the gear shift lever.
