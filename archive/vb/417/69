Subject: Re: [VB] newer air cleaner on an older bus?

Thanks for all the great responses.  I will start shopping for a later model 
air cleaner on the samba.

I do have one more question.  My Dad pointed out an ~2" opening on the engine 
tin between where the fresh air tubes funnel air into the heater boxes.  He 
was thinking that this was connected with the air cleaner, but isn't sure.  
Maybe this is a better question for a different mailing list, but does anyone 
know what this opening is for or if it's for a later model air cleaner?

All the best,
Elliott
