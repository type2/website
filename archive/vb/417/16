Subject: Identifying my engine.

Hi,

I bought a '63 panel bus and the original owner's Grandson mentioned that the 
bus' engine had been replaced when it was upgraded from 6V to 12V about 10 
years ago.

My dad and I have looked all over the engine for a code, but can't seem to 
locate one.  Online I've seen mention that it should be around where the 
generator attaches to the motor.  I'm guessing that the original was replaced 
with an unmarked OEM motor or we are just really blind.

Are there some other clues that I can look for to help identify what type and 
size of engine it is?

Cheers,
Elliott Johnson
