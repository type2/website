Subject: Re: [VB] steering column

1. dig deep hole in ground. 
2. position bus over said hole.
3. remove steering wheel.
4. unbolt steering column
5. unbolt steering gear box.
6. allow steering column to drop down into hole.
7. move bus away from said hole.
8. remove steering column from said hole.
9. done.

Alternatively, lift the bus high enough to lower the column out the bottom.
Best of luck with your floor replacement.

Cheers.
Chris


William asked:
what is the best way to remove it?? have to replace the entire cab floor
as well as the cargo floor.  Also, will need to "unhook" the heater tube
in the front to get the new floor panel in.
