Dude don't worry, do it right like you said. Paint the inside grey like a kombi would have been. Get the color matched, the finish should be good, but expect some color sanding or buffing, the painter SHOULD advise you properly on this or he will do it his damself. Don't be afraid to take the business elsewhere. This is what gives painters a bad name, they use paint they have around, they get it from a buddy, etc, they suddenly need to pay a bill and want to get paid quickly etc. I had BIG trouble even finding anyone to do it so I did it my damself, makes it harder to complain about the work!
