Someone might have better advice, like getting a proper drum puller
for one, but the last field-expedient method I heard was to remove the
cotter pin from the lock nut, loosen the lock nut a few turns, and
replace the cotter pin to prevent the lock nut from falling off. Then
drive the bus a little bit with the lock nuts loosened as described.
If still stubborn, jump a curb or two. All, of course, after soaking
with penetrating oil for a day or two. Melting paraffin wax into the
threads has also been suggested.

Oh, you are having trouble with the axle nut too. Wolfgang told me
they always come off with the EMPI socket that you hit with a hammer.
Otherwise, one bus I bought came with a custom made tool that was a
socket welded to the end of a very heavy pipe about 6 feet long...

 How about the drums??  Am I expecting a difficult time getting them
 off?? I don't have an oxy/acc torch to help me.
