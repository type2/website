Subject: RE: [VB] wiring issues ...

I actually knew you couldn't just run a wire from one brake light to the
other .. but .. I played around a bit today with the thing and I appear to
have found the problem .. like everyone suggested .. it was in the turn
signal thing .. one of the wires (black and yellow) was soldered to another
wire .. funny thing is .. it worked fine like that for at least the past
year .. anyway .. I live in the country and didn't have a soldering iron ..
sooooooo .. I borrowed one from a neighbour who does stained glass work ..
didn't work all that well but I do have it together .. I think I'll have to
get a proper soldering gun for wire and touch it up again .. 

Thanks to all who responded ..
