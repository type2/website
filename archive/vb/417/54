Subject: painting updates...

Well I spoke with PPG today. They said their DCC concept would be
compatible, no problem, just need to wait at least 16 hours before
re-coating.

I went to another body shop to discuss some options. He said I could bring
my bus in there, he would help guide me in the sanding work-he does not want
to do this. Then he would spray it, and sand/polish afterwards. He said dust
is understandable, there is always going to be dust(as most of you on the
list also said), but there shouldn't be tons of it. 

His price range sounds ok. I have heard from others who have used him, and
said his work is amazingly good.

He insists on using 2-stage paint, as he says if I ever get a scratch or
ding with it, he can blend a repair job in. If I use single stage he would
need to paint the whole panel, and then if there is any difference in paint
color between the existing and the new-it will be apparent.  He couldn't get
started, or allow me into his shop until the 2nd week in August. So I've got
some time to think about it. I'm just not sure how long I can leave it at
the current place, I'll discuss that with them next week.

Just an update.
