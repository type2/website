Volks,

I was able to get a wheel on the bus and get it into the garage and up
on bus stands last night.  Despite my initial observations (made in a
hurry while the bus was jacked up on an uneven surface and with night
falling) it looks like the stub axle is coming out at a normal angle.

When I spin it there's the normal reduction box noise of all those gears
turning but nothing seemingly out of the ordinary and not too much
axial play (although there is a tiny bit but I think it's the same as 
when I rebuilt them...I'll have to look in bentley to see if there's 
a spec on that).

The gear oil was dirtier than expected (replaced >20,000 miles ago but some
of those were hard miles) and it looks like there were some flakes but no
chunks...

So I find myself thinking it might just have been drum failure which might
have done some residual damage to the reduction box bearings while it was
failing.

I'm going to take a better look at the gear oil that came out of that RGB
and then consider putting it back together with a new drum and seeing how
it does.

Cheers,
   Tom
