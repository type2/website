take up cyberspace, but,

I sold my bus last Nov. and muh Luvly and I are now living Down Under a-la-Rob
King.  I've tried several times to unscubscribe but alas, with no success.
Can someone take me off the list?  I still have my '77 Westy, and son Bryan is
going to do a complete resto on it when he sells his '71 resto'd Westy.


Sorry for the wasted bandwith.  Long live Splitties!  Still many Bay's here
Down Under, but VERY few Splitties.

PLV,

Curt Conklin
My Sweet Bus is gone, sniff, sniff
