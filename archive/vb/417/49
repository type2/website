Subject: RE: [VB] shop-line vs DCC paints

Yes, I am worried about paint quality and compatibility, according to the
PPG site, the shop line appears to be a lesser quality paint, and I want to
go back to the DCC concept paint. I will be calling PPG regarding
compatibility, suggestions. As well as the paint store he got the paint
from.

 

If I need to wait a few weeks before painting, I may have to take the bus
back from him, as I don't know if he will store it that long, or get it
towed somewhere.
