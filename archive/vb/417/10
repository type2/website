Subject: Re: Uncle Jerry

Although I never met him, Uncle Jerry made my days on many an occasion.

 From his Aridzona Bus Sales, to his political anecdotes wrapped in  
bus content...
He was never afraid to express his opinion. He will be missed.

The archives have lost the pre-2001 content, this is one of his older  
posts.

BulliKartei is a VW Bus club located in Germany,and puts out monthly
newsletter and a great color newsletter, BulliExpress, during the year--
If you have been following the destruction going on in Afghanistan, it  
was
noted that the taliban blew up two very large Buddha Statues--they were
built some 17 Centuries ago--

To give you an idea as to the size of these Statues, The BulliExpress
has a photo of the Buddha Statue with a splittie underneath--The  
splittie
bus is 1/2" tall, the Buddha is over 12" tall--

Have a VWonderful and Vantastic Ne\X/ Year
