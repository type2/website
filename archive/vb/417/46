Kevin--

I don't know whether this reply will be useful, but 9 years ago I had an 
auto body supply shop make up a couple quarts of L87 Pearl White so I 
could repaint the bed of my 1967 doublecab.  The shop used DuPont 
Centari single stage acrylic enamel, and the results were a spot-on 
match for the rest of the truck which still had very carefully 
maintained factory original paint.  All I had to give them was the VW 
paint code and the shop did their own mixing calculations.  I still have 
part of one can left as a souvenir, which has the following mixing codes 
on a sticker:

758S Drier -- 24.9
764A Yellow -- 2.4
732A Fer Yellow -- 9.4
705A Black (HS) -- 30.3
700A White -- 429.0

Cost at the time was around $30 per quart.  If you still want real Pearl 
White, and DuPont Centari is still available, you might check it out.
