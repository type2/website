I always wondered what went into that compartment.
i figured it was where you stashed the stash...
the bus is almost finished a major restoration.
should be back on the road in about a month.
I'll bring it to a show, for sure...

Bill,



 On a benchseat bus it goes under the seat.  There is a compartment
there.   If you have never looked there you can sometimes find items
that indicate the history of the bus :-).  Bring your bus to a show in
new england - its good to hear of another bus in Mass.
