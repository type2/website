Make sure the shoes are backed off (by the adjusters) first.   If that's 
done, it's not the shoes they're hanging on. ;)

Usually the drum gets "bound" to the splined shaft.  And there are pullers 
for this job.  OTC and K-D both make one, NAPA sells it.  It works great. 
And it -WILL- pull the drum off and bend the adjusters and various other 
parts if your shoes aren't backed off...ask me how I know.


From NAPA, it's the KD-2251 3 arm puller.

A few options:

OTC # G- 827-B (four arm, use 3 for ours)
OTC # 7394 (3 arm, amazon sells it too)
K-D 2251 (same as the OTC 7393)

Here's a link to someone selling it:
http://www.amazon.com/OTC-7394-Universal-Hub-Puller/dp/B0002SRH60/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=automotive&qid=1198291468&sr=8-3

I found them from $90+shipping online when I hunted a few years ago, and I 
paid $150 for mine from NAPA - you might find a local store with it in 
stock.
