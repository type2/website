Hi Chisam,
Check out the "Classifieds" at?Thesamba.com .? There is one for a 1961 bus that is the one year only due to the slip on connections instead of the earlier screw connections.
? BTW do keep in mind that you should not repost entire old posts or digests.? Better to edit down to a minimum of what you are responding to or just delete and post your response.? This helps to keep the list and the digests down to managable amounts.? Additionally check the title you post to the list.? As you can see we changed it from the digest title you posted.
E&B
