PPG Concept single stage paint can be buffed out perfectly.  Your painter
doesn't know what he's talking about. Go to your PPG paint suppler and get the
fact sheet on the paint it will tell you when to color sand and buff the
paint. As was said the orange peel will buff out no worries IF he but enough
paint on the Bus. The dirt in the paint is another story, sand it down and
repaint.
