I recently spent months off & on trying to get the right rear drum off  
my 65 Deluxe Westy. PB Blaster, gear puller, cussing, etc. to no  
avail.  Finally a buddy brought his big puller like mentioned above &  
it still wouldn't come off, so plumbers torch on the drum, more PB, &  
BF cheater bar on an impact socket on the puller & we heard a loud  
crack & the drum moved a 1/16-1/8"!  Kept doing that until the drum  
came off an 1/8" at a time. Once broken loose & lubricated, drum went  
back on & off easily.  I think the heat/BF drum puller was the trick,  
but heat always seems to work?

VW made a shop drum puller that weighs a ton, works great, but they  
are hard to find-if you find one, get it & call moi!

YMMV,
