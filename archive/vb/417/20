Subject: seam on rear panel

Well my bus is just about ready to paint, we are still
negotiating/determining the painting procedure etc.

I noticed that the seam between the rear corner panel and the next panel
forward-this is the vertical seam on the back left and right corners-this
area seems to have a crack in it. How do you guys deal with this area. Do
you fill it with seam sealer? Just paint over it-and hope the paint covers
the seam?

Suggestions appreciated.
