Subject: hehr windows

After some exhaustive searching for window glass, I have come down to
laminated glass. I know a lot of you recommended tempered, but to get
tempered with UV block was quite expensive.

The laminate should last at least 40 years, as my original side window glass
is laminate. It is in ok condition, there is some de-laminating, but it is
minimal and it is hidden. Not bad for 40-45 years old.

The new glass will block 95% UV rays.

My glass guy has recommended using urethane adhesive instead of butyl. He
says he is not longer allowed to use butyl tape on windshields, and says
that the urethane will absorb the vibrations etc. This will negate the need
for a gasket between the glass and the frame. I like the look of the gasket,
so I may still use it, but I'm not sure if it will fit. He suggests I just
lay a fat bead of urethane on the frame, push the glass in. Let it sit
overnight or 48 hours. Then flip the frame over, and cut the excess urethane
out.

I should be getting the glass in a couple days, and I'll let you know how it
goes.
