I just went through the exact same thing.  Tracked everything down until I 
came to the TS switch.  Power in/power out on everything except the left 
brake light wire.  Sprayed contact cleaner through the switch for a minute 
or two from all angles, tried it again after everything dried and all was 
well, again.
