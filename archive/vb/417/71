Subject: Re: [VB] newer air cleaner on an older bus?

That hole is for the pre-heater hose. Helps the engine warm up on a cold 
day. See the flap on the air cleaner intake? Just below that is a place to 
connect the hose. Below the tin should be a small tube with a bevel cut that 
us used as a scoop to catch warmed up air off the cylinders.

I do have one more question.  My Dad pointed out an ~2" opening on the 
engine
tin between where the fresh air tubes funnel air into the heater boxes.  He
was thinking that this was connected with the air cleaner, but isn't sure.
Maybe this is a better question for a different mailing list, but does 
anyone
know what this opening is for or if it's for a later model air cleaner?

All the best,
Elliott
