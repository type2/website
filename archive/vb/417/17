Subject: Re: [VB] Identifying my engine.

Are there some other clues that I can look for to help identify what type and 
size of engine it is?

Hi Elliott,
Try looking below the pushrod tubes on the side of the engine for the part number of the engine case.
????That will tell you what is was, but only way to tell if it is a 1200 or 2000 cc engine is to take it apart to measure piston/cylinder size and crank throw.
