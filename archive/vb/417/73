Hi Elliott,
You could also use a 1960-63 40 HP air cleaner.? Those bolted to the engine shroud on the left with a triangle bracket.
? Either way, for your rear tin you will need to make an adapter to connect the larger post-1967 preheat to the air cleaner, OR find a later 1500 rear tin that has the smaller preheat hole and fits between the heat risers on the intake manifold.? The 1967 Beetle rear in is easier to find and you just have to block off the right side preheat opening which your bus does not need.
E&B
