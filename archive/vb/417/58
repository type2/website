Subject: Re: [VB] wiring issues ...

if you have the 2 lamp, 2 filament rear lights,, the bright element is the
turn / brake

if you join the left to the right.. then you have both bright filaments on
at the same time.. works great for brake lights.. but the turn signal
function will become hazard lights with both flashing at the same time..

you're better off to test lamp probe the wiring at T2,, beside G2 on this

the bottom 3 terminal should have power when the brake pedal is operated.

if that works. go to the tail lamp holders and clean the ground connections.

also... inspect the filaments in the lamps closely.... sometime a broken
filament can bugger with you..
