Kevin, only my previous one, get a color chit from e bay and have that
computer matched, or conversely if you still have a bit unpainted (inside of
gas tank filler is classic bit on most cars) of originial color, they can
polish it clean then shoot a match off of that.
 
Of course this is all relative, what are you comparing the "match" to. 
Memory, unpainted original bits, photos?  Only a polished unpainted not sun
exposed original bit is really accurate.  Or a chit that has been buried in a
book not exposed to sun (probably still accurate.)  PPG's little computer is
very compact and can shoot a match anywhere, you can bring a part to it, or it
to the part.  Oddly enough near whites can be surprisingly hard to match well,
subtle differences can make a big sway to "white."

He says he is going to contact his supplier to find out why the paint color
was not right. Then I am going to find someone else to paint it. Any
suggestions to make sure they mix it correctly? I have heard about paint
colors not being correct, but I thought if you had the right code - L87,
pearl white, it should be mixed correctly. Is there more mixing info that I
need?
