All of the new [15/1600] replacement cases were not stamped with numbers. 
I've seen both single and dual relief cases this way, and own at least one 
of each.


For the original poster:  engine serial numbers don't really matter 
(unless your trying to build a numbers matching, or at least period, 
restoration).


Pretty much every part, from every year (25hp/36hp/40hp engines are only 
-partially- excluded here) upright engine, from every car, including the 
pancake variation used in type3's can -fit- any other engine or car.  May 
or may not work entirely right, but...  That leaves billions of possible 
combinations of parts, particularly if you include the aftermarket 
parts...

So don't count on year/vin/engine serial to give you tune up or engine 
information.

Basic identifiers, like "single port or dual port" are pretty easy:  Look 
at the intake manifold end castings.   If they connect to the center 
section with a rubber boot, and "widen" into two ports, it's a dual port. 
If it's all 1 piece, end to end, it's a single port engine.

Dual relief vs single relief has to do with the oil pressure relief ports 
at the bottom of the engine.  Early cases had only 1 (and originally these 
would have had non-doghouse oil coolers and 10mm head studs), later cases 
had two (and doghouse oil coolers and 8mm head studs).


Grab John Muir's Idiot guide.  He does a reasonable, if dated, job of 
explaining a lot of these differences if I recall.


For tuneup information:  You set timing based on what distributor you 
have, regardless of the rest of the engine pieces.   There are numbers on 
the distributor can, match those up to this list, maintained by a list 
member:    http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ignition.htm

For carb adjustment, find the numbers on the drivers side.  Like "34pict3" 
or "H30/31" or "30pict1" etc.  Find the tuneup instructions for that carb 
and adjust accordingly.  Note that you won't find a manual entry for the 
H30/31.  It's an aftermarket carb that's basically an improved 34pict3 
designed to work on single port engines (the 34pict3/4/5 are for dual port 
engines).  Treat it like a 34pict3 for adjustment and rebuild purposes.


Points are .016", valves are .006" (.004 to .008 allowed, there's some 
religious debate in this area.)   --- unless you have a 25/36/40hp engine. 
(in which case you'll likely have a serial number and wouldn't have asked 
the original question... ;)
