Jon  Stanton here, from the Arizona Bus Club out of Phoenix.  Just wanted  
to
pass along some really sad news:  Uncle Jerry passed away around  2:30 this
afternoon (Sunday).  Most of you know he has been pretty  close to it for 
some
time now.  Melissa, his Magoo, is in a bit of a  state of shock at the 
moment,
and I'm sure could really use the VW  community's support and prayers.  Thee
really isn't a whole lot else I  can say right now other than life goes on 
and
we really need to live it the  best we can.  I'm sure more info will be 
coming
in the next few days,  but that's all I got for  now.

Jon
