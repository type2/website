Hi Elliot,
	Sure, you can use the later oil bath filter set up.  I run one on my  
'67 with a sp 1600.  It's tied up with some wire on the right side  
and it works fine.  The  big rubber hose is a bit wide for my carb  
but I made that work.  The air filter seems to be intended for the  
right side???
