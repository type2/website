Subject: Uncle Jerry

Jon Stanton here, from the Arizona Bus Club out of Phoenix.  Just wanted to
pass along some really sad news:  Uncle Jerry passed away around 2:30 this
afternoon (Sunday).  Most of you know he has been pretty close to it for some
time now.  Melissa, his Magoo, is in a bit of a state of shock at the moment,
and I'm sure could really use the VW community's support and prayers.  Thee
really isn't a whole lot else I can say right now other than life goes on and
we really need to live it the best we can.  I'm sure more info will be coming
in the next few days, but that's all I got for now.

Jon
