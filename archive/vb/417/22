Greg, please don't reply to digests to send your email to the list. 
Compose a new email to vintagebus(-at-)type2.com instead, it makes replying to 
your messages easier for everyone.

Now on to your question:

I've known Gerson, owner of Klassicfab and creator of the funky green 
panels personally for a few years, having met him at various shows.  A 
number of other notables in the VW bus community will vouch for him too if 
asked. ;)

Honest?  I'm not sure how that applies to metal, but imo, yes.

But what matters is if his metal is any good.  YES.   No replacement 
panels, even NOS factory parts, are -perfect- but his are damn good.  And 
even better, he -cares- about making them right.   If you buy a part and 
have a problem, email or call him.  He'll do his best to get it right. 
(you should hear the stories of the first set of gates he built...:)
