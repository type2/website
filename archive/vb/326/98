Subject: Karl's 66 Deluxe - Ouch! 

See pics at  http://66.34.72.138/gallery/image/2100705.JPG.  Karl 
t-boned a car that cut in front of him. He was tossed out the driver's 
door and woke up 5-10 minutes later with bumps, bruises and a cut ear. 
He's standing, but the bus won't be back on the road. Guess he'll take 
it apart and haul the pieces down to OCTO next week.
