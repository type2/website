Can't argue with Raby's open air Dyno tests. Berg ran simular tests back
in the eighties in real life applications where you have an enclosed
engine in and actual engine compartment sucking engine compartment
pre-heated air. The uprights in Ghia, Beetle and bus all benifitted from
the t-3 tin. Formulae Vee was a great benefactor of that kind of cooling
also. I trust my gages and I've ran both types of tin on those gages and
prefer the t-3 tin above the T-1 deflector plate. I have a more steady
temperature and better air flow and pressure, especially at lower RPM. I
still build engines with the standard T-1 deflector plate and have
several in the garage right now, including the VolksAir, but my work
vehicle and trike get T-3 because I want it running when I need it.

Jake Raby did back to back tests, and found higher head temps when the
Type III tin was used on a T I motor.

It's hard to argue when the same load (dyno) is put on the same motor,
in the same atmosphere conditions, and the only change made was the
addition of those tins.

One test is worth a thousand theories.
Just something to think about.
