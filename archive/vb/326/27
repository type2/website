Hi Volks,
Thanks for the great Pmails wishing Deb well  We're glad that you all enjoyed 
her writing about her bus and how it affected her life.  We will be passing 
on your replies to her in the next couple of days.  As you can tell, she is 
pretty bummed about having to sell such a big part of her life so your well 
wishes and responses will really be appreciated by her.
