I found that the "beetle plastic accordion things" unscrewed, so that I
could cut them in the middle and screw one end back on to the
"accordion".  Shortening them was no problem.

So ... what have people been using to connect the heater things to the
bus
body.  My bus is a 60 so ... I've looked at the but they are too long.
I need ones about 7".  I've been using those
foil things that stretch - they work - but I'd bet that if I could get
the
beetle ones to work they would be quieter and warmer.  Ideas?
