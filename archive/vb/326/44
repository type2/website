Sounds exactly like the classic thrust bearing and shim adjustment
problem. Your crank wasn't set up right with the .004 end play and the
crank was traveling back and forth way too much.

Found a valve on #3 sinking.

Got down to cracking the case and found that the crankshaft had
rubbed away the sides of the walls of the crankshaft journals. This
isn't normal...right? There seems to be quite a bit of case material
rubbed away and the metal is clean and shiny. The crankshaft is
smooth where it's been rubbing.
