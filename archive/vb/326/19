Subject: tool kit

So .... I found an old tool kit in a bus at a wrecker.  It is in a vinyl kinda
wrapper kinda case.  There are a couple of wrench kinda things - parts are
missing for sure - but does anyone know of a pic of a tool kit posted
anywhere?  I think this bus was a ?? I dunno - maybe 65 or so.


TIA
