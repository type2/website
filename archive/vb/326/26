Subject: RE: [VB] 66 door hinge pin

That makes sense... hadn't thought of that, thanks. I was afraid it might come
to heat, though. I don't have a torch or anything.

Thanks everyone, sounds like it's just gonna be hard to do. I was worried that
there was a trick I didn't know about and so possibly messing it up trying to
pound on it.

I almost always use heat and quenching (ala Clara) to
get those things loose, because, if you beat on it too
hard, you can loosen the hinge in the door, which
would be a REAL bummer.
