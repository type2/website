Subject: Dipstick question

I recently noticed that the PO had stuffed string in the cap on the oil
dipstick.  This makes the dipstick ride higher, which may have resulted
in my over-filling the oil by about 1/2 qt.  The 1750 engine has an
external oil cooler, oil filter and additional sump added, with total
oil capacity increased to 5.5 quarts.  Has anyone heard of a reason to
move the dipstick up a little?  Everything else the PO did seems to be
highly professional, so I am wondering whether there was a reason.
 
Thanks in advance
