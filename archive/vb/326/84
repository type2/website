Subject: RE: oil temp.

I wonder whether there is a point where the engine temps increase faster
than the oil temp?  When pushed hard, my engine smells a little hot when
I stop for gas (different than normal), even though the oil temp is
within "normal" ranges.  With an added cooler, perhaps the higher
readings are "inaccurate" (low), in relation to increases in head temp.
At a minimum, it seems like there would be a lag.

I have been driving the 23 around the last couple days with the 1885 in
it. The out side temps are in the 100's and I could not get an oil 
temp above 190. I have the oil sender tapped in where a type 3 oil
filler would be, a 92 pass oil cooler (external) with a fan with a 
thermostat that turns the fan on at 185. It does have a Porsche style
fan shroud and no engine mounted cooler.
