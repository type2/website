Took  my case to my buddy's shop. It's nice having someone willing to 
teach and not laugh at you. Turns out what I was seeing in the case 
was just the way it normally is. My "greeness" with the internals of 
the engine got me there.

He said my case looks good...needs to be cut though. Said it was 
original and hadn't been cut before. Bearings were original VW 
bearings. In general looked good. The thrust will need to be cut. The 
glandnut only had one washer on it and I think that at some time 
someone rebuild the top end or pulled the flywheel for some reason 
and messed up there. The thrust damage was all more recent according 
to my friend.

Anyway, he said to leave the case and he's gonna run it through his 
parts washer. He's got a head core I can use to replace my one that 
is going bad. So he's gonna help me re-do the heads and polish the 
crank and all that.

I'll most likely replace the cam, it's got some pitting on a couple 
of lobes. So will get new german lifters as well.

And I'll also go ahead and get a new set of pistons and cylinders.

Once I get everything cleaned and checked and measured I'll put in an 
order and through bearings and a gasket kit in there as well.

I recently got a used set of dual baby webers and a merged exhaust 
and stinger to go on the engine. It's gonna go in the Rat Rod Double 
Cab so will be just the ticket. Nothing fancy, but solid engine that 
makes a little noise and has a tad bit of pep to it.
