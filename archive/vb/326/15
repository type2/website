Welcome.

Everything is repairable... 'cept old rubber window seals I suppose.
There is a guy in SoCal, 'Gabriel' is his name, that does a lot of lock
work.  He can cut original keys and match everything up.  Search for him
on thesamba or maybe someone else will chime in with his current email.
Or, if you have the original key, You can disassembled, cleaned, and
reassemble wit a little patience.

Hi I am new to the list and new to the bus end of the air cooled vw's.
We have just acquired a 58 panel that is in need of alot of TLC and
parts. it is basically a shell with all the doors and windows but all
the little bits that could be stolen are pretty much gone.
   I have the original ignition switch and the door lock intact. Can the
ignition switch be disassembled and restored?
