Subject: 58 ignition switch

Hi I am new to the list and new to the bus end of the air cooled vw's. We have
just acquired a 58 panel that is in need of alot of TLC and parts. it is
basically a shell with all the doors and windows but all the little bits that
could be stolen are pretty much gone.
I have the original ignition switch and the door lock intact. Can the ignition
switch be disassembled and restored?
   I found the article on the type II site that dealt with the headlight
switch. that was very helpful for that one. I think the only reason that was
still there was it had become dirty enough that the thieves thought it was no
good. After disassembly and a clean up its good as new.
thanks Mark, Dorinda & Wilbur
