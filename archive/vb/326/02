Hello Guys  being in this bus for a long time  I have seen a bunch of these 
babies burn,  Old saying around here  Rust gets them slow, Fire gets them quick 
 :)   The strangest one was a fuel injected bus that threw a rod up thur the 
case and thur the 5th injector cutting the fuel line and cold start injector 
in half,  bus burnt to the ground.   Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem
