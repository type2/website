What is your recommended location?

Thanks

'64 Kombi

We are suspicious of the sump and oil relief valve plug areas 
for temp reading because these are at the lowest points of the engine in
areas 
with little to no direct oil flow.  With the added problems that heat
rises, 
plus all the air flow and any water splashed up by the wheels will cool
the 
underside of the engine case.
