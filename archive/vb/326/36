I thought I had a loose hinge pin/mirror on the drivers side. Turns out
to be a ripped out lower hinge on the door. Now I got to pull off the
door and hinge, beat the ripped metal flat, and see if I can do what the
MetWiz does in my own inferior way!

Thanks for the great advice everyone. I was mostly worried that I was
pushing when I should be turning and thus really bungling it up, plus
needing tips on making the job easier. With your advice, not only do I
know I am on the right track, but have more options on getting it done.

Thanks,
Chris
