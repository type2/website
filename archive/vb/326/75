So ...  what have people been using to connect the heater things to the  bus
body.  My bus is a 60 so ... I've looked at the beetle plastic  accordion
things but they are too long.  I need ones about 7".   I've been using those
foil things that stretch - they work - but I'd bet  that if I could get the
beetle ones to work they would be quieter and  warmer.  Ideas?

The ribs on a beetle accordian thing are spiral so you can unscrew one end  
cut the center section down and screw back together.  Mike
