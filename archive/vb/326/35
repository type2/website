Subject: Ohio BBB04 event wrap up...

Hey Y'all,
Just a little note to wrap up the Fourth Annual VW
Buses, Bands, & Brews event from last weekend.  We
ended up with about 32 buses plus a bug, a jetta, and
a few other misc. bus people in non-buses.  Anyway, it
was a great time for me, and every one I have talked
to seems to agree.  The big hit of the weekend turned
out to be the Homebrew\Microbrew tasting.  Everybody
loved this part of the event, bunch of lushes ;^)
Anyway, campground manager sends his thanks to
everyone for being a great group and says he's dying
to get us back again next year.
So here is a list of people I need to thank, and I
apologize in advance for those I miss.
Big thanks to: Frank Biffath for the chili. Frank, you
did it again! I hope you were able to re-coup some of
your expenses.  Another big thanks to Clark Gordon for
the wonderful music. Very few musicians will drive 200
miles to play a gig for free, but Clark did, thanks
for that!!  Thanks to everyone who brought brews for
the beer\wine tasting, it was soooo Yummmmmy!!  The
"Above and Beyond" Award goes to Mr. Phil Cain for
helping so many people work on their buses, Phil your
mechanical knowledge is both your blessing and your
curse!!  Another big thanks to EVERYONE who attended,
it was a great time!!
Also, I have a few Adult Small tshirts and quite a few
Youth size Tshirts leftover, if you want one, its $12
per shirt.
I promise that I will have pictures posted by the end
of this weekend!! In the meantime, don't forget to
mark your calendars for the Second OVT\FMBC Bus Bash
at the Baker Place on July 10. Here's the link with
that info:
