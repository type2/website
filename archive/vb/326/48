That's a smart fix.  I had the same thing happen in
the parking lot of McDonalds.

original message;

...Turned out that
the cable was fine (I do have a spare), but the lever
that pulls it was
stripped out, (where the cable attaches) and the metal
gave way, so I pulled
the actuating lever out, and reversed it, and that
seemed to work just fine.
