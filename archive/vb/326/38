I'll use a case up to .030 overbore knowing that it will have a short
life span. .020 is the maz for a "dependable" vehicle, and .010 cases
are always good in my book. Now that there are aluminum cases available
out there the issue of overboring is not as serious as it is with the
021 and 041 cases. All things being equal, give me a new case, either
flavor, for a longlasting motor.

What is the story with line boring cases? How many times can
a case be cut before it is scrap?

Why do heavily bored cases not last --
