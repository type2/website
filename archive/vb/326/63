Unfortunately there won't be. Getting into yosemite during the summer is as easy as finding a NOS bus trip MPH speedo! The reservations were made back in Feb and because of the demand there is to camp there we ended up having to doulble up on campsites because we weren't able to get as many sites as we wanted. I am always down for camping so if there is a campout for the list you can count me in.
