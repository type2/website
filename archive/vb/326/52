5 mm worth of play? that's...like um..... bad. That could very easily
be the reason your rear seal is leaking. spacers will not take out
this endplay. if you want it fixed I feel pretty sure you will be
doing an rebuild. I suppose it's possible for the flywheel to be
actually installed incorrectly and not seated on the crank, but in
either case you will be giving that engine a good looking at.

it "could" cause a warped flywheel, be letting the clutch spin a lot
creating extra heat, but if this engine is as far out as it sounds
from the endplay, it might have just been warped to begin with and
never resurfaced.
