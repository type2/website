Jim,
Going on with the temperature pick up point.
Do you have a dual relief case and if so then the point that you have 
the sender is near the rear of the bus on the bottom???
Have you calibrated your sender / gauge with ??? we used boiling water 
corrected for altitude.
What type of cooling do you have doghouse, type 4, external,???
Our temp sender is at the relief to the rear and 225 degrees is good 
because it wants to go higher and we do about 50 mph at about 3200 rpm.
P & C
