Subject: Re: [VB] 66 door hinge pin

tricky tricky tricky.   hammer and punch.  loads of penetrating oil.  
patience.  try again tomorow.  Did it to put a drivers side mirror on my 61.  PITA.   
You can torch and quench it if you don't mind messing up the paint. the pin 
gets rust welded to one part of the hinge

Any advice on how to remove the passenger side hinge pin on a 66? I am trying
to install a mirror but can't get the *$%*&% pin out! Does it not come out
straight? Does it need to be turned somehow? It doesn't have a screw slot, so
I wouldn't think it unscrews... but the bugger just won't come out!
