My friend Joe, currently a ghia operator, had an autostick go up after a mechanic failed to properly clamp an in-the-engine-compartment fuel filter.
he threw flour on it, and it burned until the FD put dry chemical on it.

Joe's dad, a prominent local sales manger of dealership hondas, had the mechanic pay cash for the loss that afternoon.
