I have 4 009's on the shelf ready for rebuild that do the same thing.
Two of them have frozen centrifigul spring assemblies and the other two
have shafts that wobble waiting on bushing sets.

The other problem I have seen is from an engine that was over torqued
while cold. When it comes up to temp the valves won't close all the way
causing miss fires and back fires and limitting the upper rpms.

Problem:
Engine idles perfect, but during acceleration the engine starts to
mis-fire right around 1800rpm and above.

Background of the engine:
1600dp, 009, 34Pict-3, 1000 miles since rebuild, 85-90psi compression in
all four cylinders, stock cam, 040 heads, German stock exhaust, etc...

Thanks,
