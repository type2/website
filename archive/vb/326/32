Subject: RE: [VB] 66 door hinge pin-Thanks!

Thanks for the great advice everyone. I was mostly worried that I was pushing
when I should be turning and thus really bungling it up, plus needing tips on
making the job easier. With your advice, not only do I know I am on the right
track, but have more options on getting it done.

Thanks,
Chris
