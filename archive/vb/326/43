Subject: dual port tear down

tore down a 1600cc dual port engine I had around to see about 
rebuilding for the Rat Double Cab Truck.

Found a valve on #3 sinking.

Got down to cracking the case and found that the crankshaft had 
rubbed away the sides of the walls of the crankshaft journals. This 
isn't normal...right? There seems to be quite a bit of case material 
rubbed away and the metal is clean and shiny. The crankshaft is 
smooth where it's been rubbing.

Was gonna take the case to my buddy tomorrow who's got a little more 
experience. Thought he could give me the lowdown. Wanted to ask the 
list this first though as it's bugging me tonight.
