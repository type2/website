--Ric, 

Eric and Barbs advice was good, I lost shift coupler screws this last week that didn't have the safety wire.  I just went through the whole shifter linkage on my '65 after replacing a transmission.  Engagement of 1/2 was my big problem.

Final answer was loosening the two bolts on the shifter base, pushing the floating lock-out plate underneath it to the passenger side, which favors engagement of 1/2.  Moving it to driver side favors 3/4, forward favors 2/4, rearward favors 1/3.  I used a sheetrock saw to get under there, but anything flexible will work.

Hope this helps, 

Billy
