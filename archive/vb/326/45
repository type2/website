Subject: Trip report: Yosemite, etc.

Just completed a 1,500 mi. trip in my 1964 Kombi from Los Angeles,
riding mostly alone.  The bus engine is 1776 with dual Delorto carbs.
Oil is cooled & filtered.  Stock trans.  Has a wide fold-a-bed (very
comfortable) and a table that I made.  I also made the curtains, which
include a front screen that wraps around (like Westys).
 
Drove up the coast to San Luis Obispo for dinner with my son, in
college.  Camped on the coast.  Then crossed California on Hwy 41 to
Fresno.  After a visit with friends, continued up Hwy 41 to Yosemite.
Bus pulled strong up the grade, in 4th & 3rd.  Camped in Yosemite.
Drove over Tioga Pass, several days after it was opened from the winter.
The bus ran very strong and cool in the high altitude.  Then continued
up hwy 395 to Carson City for a visit with my Sis.  
 
Returned down hwy 395 to Bridgeport, where I stayed several days at a
ranch near Twin Lakes.  Took several side trips on dirt roads, including
one 4-wheel drive road.  It brought back memories of my teenage years,
when we would take busses on all kinds of old mining roads in the area.
The engine compartment sure got dusty.  Returned to LA down 395 to 14.
 
Throughout the trip, I drove mostly 55 - 60 mph.  I watch oil temp, oil
pressure & RPM.  At 60 mph, the engine is working noticeably harder than
55.  The engine (oil) temperature remained fairly constant 180 +/-,
except through the Mojave Desert where it increased to 210.
 
Cheers,
