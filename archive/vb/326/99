yup, me. most days in phoenix, the oil temp OUT of the cooler never 
goes above 150. when i stop after a prolonged run (at a light, say) 
and the fan speed goes down, you can see the oil temps climb rapidly 
to 180.
head temps have mysteriously gone from an average of 350 to near 400, 
and i need to see if it is the gauge or for real.....
