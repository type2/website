Subject: Re: [VB] 66 door hinge pin-Thanks!

those 64-67 doors with the prop do that... I fixed it on my 67 riviera by 
welding it with the door on.   A little grinding, a little primer and paint... 
not show quality but not ugly and the door shuts much better.  :)  

grease that door prop and make sure the rolley things actually roll..

I thought I had a loose hinge pin/mirror on the drivers side. Turns out
to be a ripped out lower hinge on the door. Now I got to pull off the
door and hinge, beat the ripped metal flat, and see if I can do what the
MetWiz does in my own inferior way!
