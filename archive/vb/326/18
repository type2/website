Subject: 66 door hinge pin

Any advice on how to remove the passenger side hinge pin on a 66? I am trying
to install a mirror but can't get the *$%*&% pin out! Does it not come out
straight? Does it need to be turned somehow? It doesn't have a screw slot, so
I wouldn't think it unscrews... but the bugger just won't come out!

Thanks,
Chris
