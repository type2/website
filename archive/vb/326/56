Yup, bought the bus 31 years ago today.

Bus content:

Figured out why it was't idling well - distributor that's been in there
for 12 years has finally just worn out the spacers at the bottom, and
there's so much vertical shaft play that it's skipping. Hoping to
disassemble and replace those missing spacers shortly, but the engine
works fine with the spare unit. Both units are 205T's, the wornout one's
had a breakerless Crane setup for 12 years - no problems before this, and
the other one's got points (yuk!).

Still have some wierd questionable noises on the left side when it warms
up. Prolly still needs internal work. We'll see.
