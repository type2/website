while i enjoyed reading Debs email and i know EXACTLY how she feels, my wife 
and i came to the same conclusion after reading it.... WHY DID SHE SELL IT?!

dont take this the wrong way, i feel for her, but i just dont understand 
that if she loved the bus sooo much (which is OBVIOUS), how is $600 going to 
continue her education and change her life? forgive my doubt, i dont want 
this to come across the wrong way and i wish her the best.
