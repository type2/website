Hi Kurt,
5 millimeters is about .200" and the VW limits for the end play is .003" to 
.008".  No amount of shimming to get even near the proper end play is going to 
work without causing the crank to lock up.  BTDT with only .080" end play.  
Time for a complete engine rebuild and we have our doubts the engine case is 
going to be usable.
