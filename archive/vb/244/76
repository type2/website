Was kinda funny though. A real NO TOLERANCE policy. Maybe it's the
balljoints that make your sphincter clinch up...who knows. I  apologized
for  it publicly on the list and brought my toys back home.

Jeez they were mean to you.
I posted the address for a virus fix and I got banned for life.
That's OK though, I'm already 61 so I'll only be punished for maybe
another 20 years or so.
Can you imagain how hard it must be on an 18 year old kid to be banned
for life, geez that could mean 75 years of pure suffering without the
type2 list.
