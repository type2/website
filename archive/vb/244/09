Subject: Re: [VB] Full-Flow System Oil Pressure

Upon initial start-up/run, my new engine maintained 40psi at a hot idle, with 
a 26mm pump, full flowed with 1/2" rubber lines and a 'releif' cover.  Then 
again, everything is new.  On top of that, I think it has a lot to do with 
how picky (anal) the builder is about such things.  I once again have to give 
credit for this to Jim Burnite for being so picky (anal) even though I rag on 
him about it.  There are a LOT of things that can affect oil pressure, and 
any one of them being neglected or scrimped on could give poor results.
