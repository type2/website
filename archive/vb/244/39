The size of the lines does not determine pressure, but it does
determine the pressure loss in the circuit.  larger is better.

The only reason I say all the stupid things I say is that I've been
scrounging oil coolers from Rx7s, big Mercedes, Saab and everything else
in wrecking yards that have oil coolers.
Seems they all stop at about 1/2" ID, with the exception being the
Porsche with the oil cooler all the way in the front and engine in the
rear, it uses 1" lines and I've heard it runs at over 90 psi routinely.
When you start cutting the lines off, very few have fittings ID of over
3/8" and those having Banjo Bolts normally have two 1/4" holes (converted
to metric).
