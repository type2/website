Subject: Re: [VB] Full-Flow System Oil Pressure

Somebody on this list had a Berg full flow oil pump cover with the 
pressure relief valve built in give him a problem with low oil 
pressure.  It turned out that the relief valve had a bit of something 
stuck in it so that the valve was dumping oil back causing low oil 
pressure.  Does your system have a pressure relief valve?   Gary Gibson
