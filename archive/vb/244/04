Subject: RE: [VB] Happy 44th double cab

As per vintage paint, I originally asked my painter for lacquer but he
quickly told me to go away...  Its just like trying to get OG air in the
tires, sometimes you have to put a limit to things... or like window
rubbers... you can find 'em but don't use 'em cuz they're gonna crack
real soon.

BUT, I was semi tempted to find 4 cans of early 70's oil to use in the
motor after the initial break in period.  I do have a can of Texaco oil
that has a 5-59 date code on it!  I have begun to look for vintage
fuses.  Everett bugged me a while back about having correct Hella and
Osram light bulbs.
And yes, I have used a new, non og, fuel tap wire mesh filter.

Oh, as per flames, Richard Barker emailed me regarding that, which gave
me a good/bad (depending on your disposition) idea... Just you all wait
:-)
