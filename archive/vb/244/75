 It never bothered me that hippies were selling stuff here either, as long as it was VW related and not grilled cheese! 
 Seriously, I think it's good too, and like you said within reason. Because of The List, I know that should I ever find a stash of old bolts or strange strips of felt, who to call/email!.
