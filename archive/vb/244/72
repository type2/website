Right! I WAS subscribed to the T2 list but never read it. I committed the 
carnal sin and posted something on eBay over there right in the middle of a 
big fight about eBay and got chastised & kicked off the list immediately. 
My fault for sure, I should have checked with the rules first or at least 
read the posts every now and then.

Was kinda funny though. A real NO TOLERANCE policy. Maybe it's the 
balljoints that make your sphincter clinch up...who knows. I apologized for 
it publicly on the list and brought my toys back home.

p.s. Some non-list member scored a NEW bay rear brake drum for $11.00.
