Either one of the terminals is for the gauge and the other is ground,
or one of the terminals if for the gauge, the other is for a light, and
it grounds through the body.

Per "Electric Gauges (Temperature, Pressure & Fuel), 0-515-012-123" from
http://www.vdona.com/Tech%20Support/Automotive/Instructionsheets.htm ,
for the senders that replace the original screw-in sender, the terminal
marked "WK" is for the idiot light and the other terminal is for the
gauge.  They don't mention a copper/brass "color code".  These senders
ground through the mounting threads.

According to the "Trouble Shooting Guide, 0-515-012-178" from the same
page, VDO temperature senders read ~700 ohms cold.  You could take an
ohm-meter and measure between the two terminals, and between each terminal
and the metal body of the sensor.  You'll probably get one of two results:

Measurement     Case 1     Case 2
brass - copper  700 ohms  700 ohms
brass - case    open      700 ohms
copper - case   open        0 ohms

In Case 1, it's just a sender, not a sender+switch.  One of the terminals
goes to ground and the other terminal goes to the gauge.  It shouldn't
matter which terminal is which.

In Case 2, it's a sender+switch.  The body is the ground, the copper
terminal is for the warning light, and the brass terminal is for the
gauge.

If you're still not sure, your ohm-meter and a pot of water on the stove
will let you figure out what's going on, without risk of burning out the
sender or the gauge.
