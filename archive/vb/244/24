Subject: RE: [VB] Full-Flow System Oil Pressure

I aim for pressure, of course. As the oil heats the pressure will drop with
the viscosity of the oil. Little pumps need big help.

Bernoulli Interval: Do I really have enough data to draw a valid conclusion ?

You usually have to sand down the body to get the 2 thousands max
clearance with the cover on but
after that they seem to work pretty good for open engine applications
like trikes and dune buggies. I like to take my oil from the oil cooler
holes and route it to the external cooler and the oil filter. The
fittings for most of these adapters are 3/8" and I have never had a
dangerous pressure drop. Plus the oil filter slows the oil down in the
cooler an additional amount of time to extract a little more heat.

Are you shooting for a target pressure, a target temperature or just
hoping for the best?
I ask this because VWs tend to seek higher oil pressure, GM seems to be
the middle of the road and Ford usually runs low pressures.
I can't speak for other cars except Mercedes which runs low pressures as
well (don't know about diesel).
Jags don't count since they loose the rear mains on a regular $5000.00
schedule.
My MGs pumped 60 max and ran for 11 years that I owned it and 9 years
that the new owner/buyer has had it, and that is a 7000 rpm engine if
you're not careful. (1275cc Dual stock Solex).
I don't want to plug my new business but I'd like to have somebody run a
fully enhanced Ceramic engine and monitor the results.
If somebody had the many boxes of new parts I'd be willing to do the
ceramic coatings at a legal theft price if they are knowledgeable about
VWs.
