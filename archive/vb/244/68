Brake systems run very high pressure, but virtually no flow.  Small lines
can have thinner walls for the same pressure.

The only loss will be pressure, if the friction of the fluid passing
through the hose is too great.  The faster the fluid flow (in linear, not
volume, terms) the more the resistance.  Large lines decrease the linear
rate of flow.  That is why Porsche runs _really_ big lines to their
front-mounted oil coolers.
