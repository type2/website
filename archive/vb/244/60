Subject: RE: [VB] NEW Dropped spindles

  I have been trying through my importers to get the link pin disc brake
components for years with no luck, along with the IRS reduction boxes. I
guess I need to make a trip to Brazil.  I do have the Brazilian part numbers
for these and have only had luck getting the link pins (late style) and the
king pins (early style). The Brazilian front spindles use the combonation of
different years

ps. VW de Brazil also made /makes split bus sheet metal, not the normal crap
we regular see but an actual real VW stamping. I was getting this sheet
metal for a while from Europe.  It seems that there is a fair trade thing or
something that VW placed on VW made parts that excludes them from import to
the U S A.
