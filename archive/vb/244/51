Subject: RE: [VB] Shifter rod boot on tranny?

Hi Markus,

Yes, there is a boot that goes where the hockey stick enters the nose
cone... it is different than the one that seals the frame to shift rod
as you already noted.  I got mine from a transaxle builder.  Don't know
if people like WCM or WW sell em tho.


Good luck.


David

Markus pondered:
Is there a boot or something on the tranny shift rod?
