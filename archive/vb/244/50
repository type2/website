Subject: RE: [VB] New Plugs = Backfire???

George, That's what I experienced.
Valve adjustment and changing new plugs to Bosch caused
serious backfire.
At first I suspected ignition timing, checked but there was no problem.
then cleaned carb(34pict3) completely, but no change.

The answer was No.2 plug.
It looked good shape, but electrically bad one.
Never use Bosch BRASIL!
I changed it to NGK B6HS and runs great.
