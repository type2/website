Did all buses come with a middle seat? I am pretty sure panels didn't, but 
what about Kombis?
 
 
 No middle seats in panels for sure, kombis had rear and middle sets that were not as nice as the standard or deluxe models.


Why are so many buses missing them? Where did they all go?
 
 
People took them out to make more room; If you knew where they all were you would be in the middle of negotiations for the purchase of your own state!

What is one really worth?


Subjective. The price range depends on who wants it, how bad and what year it's from. A Barndoor middle seat would fetch more than say a 66 kombi seat.

65 Westfalia (no middle seat needed)
