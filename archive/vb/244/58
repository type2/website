anything I say is on the hundreds of engines I have done. The classroom
is fine for theory, but eventually the mechanics of the situation takes
over.

Empirical data can be useful, but you have to be careful not to allow
it to lead us astray.  I don't doubt your observations, but I do think
that they need to be investigated further before blaming the line size for
low oil pressure.  Considering that the supply of oil to the lines is
constant and the volume of the lines is unchanging, there is nothing to
explain why the pressure at the end should be lower for large lines.  That
is what has my curiosity going.

Your .sig is very applicable to this situation.

Bernoulli spent a lot of time in classrooms talking theory, and his
equation for fluid flow works both in and out of the classroom.
