Subject: Re: [VB] Full-Flow System Oil Pressure

26mm pumps are plenty as long as your engine is not worn out. Low pressure
might be due to the pump cover. If the pump cover is not re-surfaced, then
you will loose oil pressure. Put the pump cover on a belt sander until the
cover is perfectly smooth, and no imperfections on the surface.

I'm running a 26mm pump with a total of about 11 feet of oil line and
maintain great oil pressure, even with 5w30 oil.
