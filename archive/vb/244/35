Subject: Re: [VB] Emergency type 4 help!?

The device that was shorted is VW# 022 906 079  It is about 2 or 3 inches
long
and about an inch square, and has 5 black wires going to it.
The engine does not run. 
The fuel pump stays on with the device unplugged. 
What is up? 
Please help!

You've got two things there.
#1) Resistor Pack, 5 black wires goung to a metal shell conatining
resistors to lower FI voltage to 8 volts.
#2) Double relay, two relays side by side, normally black, one bundle of
white wires on right side This controls the fuel pump after the AFM gives
it up.
I'd open the cover on the AFM and see if the microswitch for the fuel
pump is burnt closed.
It'll be all the way to the right and the only exposed switch.
