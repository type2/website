What is the purpose of small lines in a brake system ???

"What goes in must come out". Einstein ? Dr.Spock ?

Speed vs. flow vs. pressure - Back to Pascal / Bernouli.
Something happens when the hose size changes, but
it does eventually get back to the case oil galley bore.
How fast is sludge ?

Melling pumps are cast-iron. They expand at a different rate.
Do they last longer than an aluminum pump ?
The case has a tolerance for the pump bore size. It is
70.00-70.03mm ( 2.7559-2.7570 ).
So, even a new case can be +/- .0011 loose.
Oil pumps are manufactured to even looser tolerances.
Berg has a solution for that. They machine a groove
for an o-ring on the pump body.
Then there's the question of blueprinting the pump and cover.
If you shave the pump to .002 and then add a paper gasket,
what exactly is the proper clearance ? Why can't this be
provided by the manufacturer ? German pumps did.
