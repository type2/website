Sounds like a floating valve from a rocker not adjusted right or maybe the
valve is sticking.

OK, I've got a stumper...1600 single port, 009 (I know, I know), 30/31
carb. I just adjusted my valves (only about 3 or 4, the rest were
fine), changed my oil, and put in new Bosch w8ac plugs. Engine still
runs fine, but seems like it takes a little longer to warm up, and the
kicker is that it now backfires at idle. Not a whole lot, and not
really loud ones, just little pops, which seem to go away as soon as I
up the RPM's...
Any thoughts? Ideas?
Thanks,
