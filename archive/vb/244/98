Subject: speedo vs. tire size

Hey, came up with a question before I undertook the change of my speedometer.
The good working one I got from Bob Petzel is a '62 vintage and my SC is a 67.
I am running PR195-14 tires and I have no idea what size tires and diameter
the 62's were. Am I going to have a disparity in my speed reading by using a
62 speedo in a 67 ?
