Subject: Emergency type 4 help!?

Please forgive me for the type 4 question..

Please crosspost to the type 4 list if necessary.

A friend is over, and we were poking around his engine ('83 Vanagon) to try to
find out why he was lacking power.

I attached the ground wire (alligator clip) of my digital tach. to a device at
the front right upper firewall.  The clip slipped, and grounded the inside of
the device to its frame, and a spark sparked, and the engine stopped.

A fuse up front was blown, and the fuel pump runs with the key OFF when fuse
was repaced.

The device that was shorted is VW# 022 906 079  It is about 2 or 3 inches long
and about an inch square, and has 5 black wires going to it.

The engine does not run.

The fuel pump stays on with the device unplugged.

What is up?

Please help!

Gene
