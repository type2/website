Subject: RE: [VB] AH Case w/ Dual 34 ICT 009 Timing?

I always ran the timing with my Baby Dells the same as with the center mount
34 PICT-3, 28 degrees (-at-) 2800-3000 rpm. .009's are all in around 2600-2800
depending on the age of your advance spring. Are you running a vacuum balance
tube between the two carbs?

A year ago I built adapters for my T-4 34 PDSIT-3 carbs and mounted them on
ICT manifolds with ICT linkage on my trike, works great. I also run a .009. I
was running a dual point .050 for awhile but there is no #3 retard on the
distributor cam so a switched back to .009.

Just installed a set of 34's out of the box.  What is the recommended
timing?  I'm idling at tdc now.

TIA!
