Also make sure you do not retard the timing too far. I built an engine
once that turned the exhaust pipes bright orange with a total advance of
28 degrees. LOL

Isn't a too lean or too far advance going to show up on the spark plugs?.
I get near white on too lean and a nice coffee with cream color when
everything is tuned in pretty good.
Appears that the plugs would be self destructing at the same time the
exhaust was reaching bright orange /cherry red.
