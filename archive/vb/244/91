The exhaust gets bright orange because combustion is still taking place
during the exhaust stroke. This happens because the timing is too retarded.
To correct this problem, you must advance the timing, to keep the combustion
contained within the combustion stroke. Run too long with the timing too
retarded, and you'll be dropping exhaust seats in no time!
