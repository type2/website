Subject:      CV Repair


I have an '85 Vanagon that needs new CV joints. I was just interested in
seeing how much all of you had paid for your replacement.

The guy quoted 185 for a new joint and labor for 1 (that's making the most
noise)

                            OR

$580 for all 4.

I know for sure that I can't do all 4...I'm a student w/ $5 in checking and
$20 in savings. Is there anything that I can do to make sure the other 3
last just until summer? I should have enough $$$$ for it then.

*Any* help or suggestions are appreciated!

PS...If you give me really good advice I'll tell you how the van was for
living in during the fall semester...I had to..not enought $$ for rent
