Subject: V6 EV / aux. batterys

Just got back from the SF Auto Show - VW had a V6 EV on display, as a
Winnebago camper conversion.  Unless the grill/radiator tip forward (didn't
seem to) changing plugs is gonna be a real b*tch.  The rep said there is
absolutely no possibility that any sort of Syncro/4wd will be available.

(as an aside that's definitely going to get me flamed to well done - I was
wandering around &amp; thru &amp; sitting inside a GMC Astro Van, then back to the
EV, back to the GMC, &amp; you know what - with less wasted space in front of
the driver, more walk-thru room between the seats,a 4.3l V6, AWD, ABS,
cheaper parts available more places, lower initial price, etc etc etc, I
came to the conclusion that it would never replace the Vanagon, but the EV
would come in a poor 2nd {I know, I know - blasphemyblasphemy!!!}.  I have
the 4.3 V6 in an AWD Jimmy, &amp; it's a terrific engine, + we get 17+ around
town, 21+ on the AZ dashes). (commence torching....;&gt;).

The thread that occasionally runs regarding 2nd batteries doesn't apply to
me, but I picked up a brochure from a company called 'Lightning Audio'
(Tempe, AZ, 800/726-8178), &amp; on the back page is listed (quote) &quot;Lightning
Cell Car Audio battery - peak discharge 1,200 amps, cold crank 550 amps,
short circuit 2,600 amps, reserve capacity 25 amps-72 minutes; 9.67x5x6.5&quot;,
43% smaller than Optima, warrant (sic) for deep cycle applications, sealed
design 100% maint. free, mounts in any position yadada yadada etc &quot;.  Sure
seemed like a pretty dinky battery to have all those amps floating around
inside.
