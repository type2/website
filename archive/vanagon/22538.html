So Maher, Steve says:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Do you know how to save a drowning lawyer? - No. - Great!
&gt; &gt;Thom Fitzpatrick
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Well, it's Friday, so...
&gt; 
&gt; Q: What do you call 500 lawyers at the bottom of the sea?
&gt; 
&gt; A: A good start.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Q: An ocean liner sank, and all the people jumped overboard and
&gt; started swimming. Sharks came, and started eating the people, but
&gt; they didn't eat any of the lawyers. Why not?
&gt; 
&gt; A: Professional courtesy.
&gt; 

Why do I think this is going to be a 'bad hair' day for Ric?  ;)
