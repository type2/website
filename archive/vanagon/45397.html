Subject: Vanagon GL Oil pressure problem
Date: Thu, 27 Jun 1996 10:36:02 -0400 (EDT)

 &gt; 
&gt; Just did some hard driving this morning about 100 miles at about
&gt; 70 mph and my oil pressure light came on, sort of fluttering.
&gt; Seems like impending problem. It did go away after I accelerated but on idle
&gt; the light came on  for awhile. Any comments on why this is happening ?
&gt; There are no leaks and the oil level is normal. Engine is still responding
&gt; nrmally. Any response is  anxiously  awaited.
&gt; Maybe I should just sell this damned bus.VW's dont seem to last.
&gt; This 84 Vanagon GL only has 69k miles has been garaged for several years 
&gt; body is in very good condition except bumpers are missing one rear plastic
&gt; corner piece.
&gt; This is a list of the things I have done since I bought the bus new in 1984
&gt;  
&gt; 1) Replaced clutch three times by dealer 25,000k, 32000k, 54000k.
&gt;    Each time the deaker just replaced the parts but never checked why
&gt;    it failed. The last time I did it myself and I believe the problem
&gt;    is corrected. Clutch hydraulics problem and incorrect shift linkage
&gt;    from new, created a nightmare for me. No thanks to VW or their dealers.
&gt;    All they could tell me was I had abuse my clutch.It was their easy way 
&gt;    out.
&gt; 2) Front wheel bearings replaced at about 34000 miles
&gt; 3) CV joints replaced at 53000 miles
&gt; 4) Water pump replaced at about 54000 miles
&gt; 5) Muffler replaced around 47000 miles
&gt; 6) Head leak problem repaired by dealer ( one side ) 34000 miles
&gt;    They still charged me for the work. About $750.00 I think.
&gt; 7) I did both sides myself around 62000 miles
&gt; 8) Push rod tubes replaced at 62000 miles .
&gt; 8) Airconditioner hoses ruptured at around 50000 miles.
&gt; These are just the major problems. I have not even mentioned the minor
&gt; problems which can get pretty long which of course can be considered wear 
&gt; and tear replacements.
&gt; Now I just hope I can clear 100k before the engine has 
&gt; to be rebuilt.
&gt; Any one wants to buy my lemon which is still in quite good condition ?
