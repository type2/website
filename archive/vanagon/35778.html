Hey dude, did you look at your tape of that show?  Pretty fun, esp. old
factory stuff and tape of old Porsche racing (howzabout we go 100mph
in a car with cable brakes?) plus VW ads.  I'd never seen the snowplow
ad, so that was fun.

Did you see the credits to Bob Case and the MVVC?  I wonder what they
did.

Hey, my bus is back!  Did the carb setting per the little rebuild
sheet instructions, and runs great.  Still tries to stall before it's
totally warmed up, I think I need to tighten the choke a bit.

get that squarebk goin'

Mark
