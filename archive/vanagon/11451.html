Subject: weights of engines

Interesting numbers in an editorial reply to a letter in Kit Car magazine, 
March 1995 issue.  Engine weights, less flywheel, clutch, and &quot;options&quot;:
1600cc VW    215
Porsche 914  265
VW Type 4    311
Porsche 911  280
Mazda rotary 260
Ford 5l V8   450

transaxles:
VW Bug        71
Corvair      149
VW Bus        79
Porsche 901   89
ZF Pantera   135
Porsche 915  109

Depending on what &quot;options&quot; means, some of these seem suspicious.  Maybe they
weigh the heater boxes on the Type 4 but not on the 914?  The numbers are
attributed to Kennedy Engineered Products (no relation).  Can anyone confirm
from the Kennedy catalog?  Did I really *lighten* my Vanagon by pulling out
that huge 4 and putting in the feathery little 165hp 6?

B.
