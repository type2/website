&gt;Question is: how high is the westy in total?

Assuming your 84 is the same as the 86, the 86 brochure states:

Wheelbase: 96.9&quot;
Front track: 62.4&quot;
Rear track: 61.8&quot;
Length: 179.9&quot;
Width: 72.6&quot;
Height: 80.9&quot;
Ground clearance: 7.5&quot;
Turning circle: 35.1 Ft curb-to-curb
