Subject: Re: '81 #3 cylinder


&gt;As I reported earlier, pulling off the #3 wire from the distributor makes
&gt;no difference how the engine runs.
&gt;
&gt;I checked the spark, and it is fine, so I suspected the fuel injector or
&gt;wiring.  First, I swapped the wires on #3 and #4, with no change.  Then, I
&gt;swapped the injector on #3 with the one on the #4.  Again no change.
&gt;
&gt;I really don't know what to try now.  Any suggestions will be appreciated
&gt;and tried.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Bill

Just because the spark is fine doesn't neccessarily mean a fuel injection 
problem. A burnt valve (or the dreaded dropped valve seat, a common problem 
on the Type 4 motor) could also cause your problem.  If you have access to 
a compression tester, use it now. If not, try process of elimination.  You 
can definatively test whether the injector is spraying by physically 
disconnecting it from the manifold, and holding a rag around it while 
someone starts the engine. Be ready to yell as soon as it sprays (if it 
sprays).  Either it will spray fuel or it won't.  If it does, then it is 
likely that neither fuel supply nor spark is your problem. This points 
towards an internal engine problem, and, unfortunately, bad news.

Good luck...
