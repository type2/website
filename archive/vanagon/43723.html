Subject: 81 timing marks

I had completed putting the tin back on the motor and was getting ready to
set the valves when I realized that I couldn't find the timing mark on the
fan hub. Am I blind or could this thing have been painted on rather than
stamped in the metal and is now gone? Now what do I do?

I also noticed for the first time in replacing the tin what a sizable hole
the slot for the oil filler tube presents. This of course opens directly
under the fan and feeds hot air right off the muffler. I'm going to tape it
off as I am other holes but wonder if originally there was a rubber grommet,
or the like, sealing or at least reducing this gap?

Thanks,

Weston
