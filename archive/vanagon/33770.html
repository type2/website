Subject: Re: Wavering Wannabus

Harvey's diesel Vgon MUST run every day.  My question is, do you think of
it as a hobby?  The exact same garage tasks that I look forward to doing,
in the 4-5 hours I can set aside per weekend, would be an intolerable
chore if I had to do them, on the car's schedule rather than mine.  I've
had my share of working in a cold garage until 2am to get a car ready
to take me to work at 8am; it almost put me off the car hobby, and 15-
year old VW buses are no way to avoid that kind of thing.

As I think it through, maybe my point is not so much that you should have
a Japanese car for each driver in the family, as that you should have 
more than 1.0 car for each driver in the family if 1.0 car is an oldy.
You need enough fall-back so that the bus' need for repairs from time
to time will be perceived as its endearing vulnerability rather than its
inexcusable inability to stay fixed.
