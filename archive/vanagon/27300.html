Subject: 65 bus still won't start
Date: Mon, 23 Oct 95 14:52:34 PDT

A few days ago I made this post:

&gt;This morning I went to start my bus and it turned over like every
&gt;other morning. But after a few seconds it just died. Tried again to
&gt;start it and everything is churning but it won't start. So, I let it
&gt;sit for 5 minutes(thinking maybe it is flooded) and try to start it
&gt;again. Starts right up but again in a few seconds it dies. Applying
&gt;the accelerator pedal to keep it idling didn't work.
&gt;
&gt;I let it sit again for a few minutes and try once more but get the
&gt;same results.  I was late for work so I didn't get a chance to check
&gt;things out thoroughly.  I'm pretty much a novice mechanic, so any
&gt;ideas on what to check or if someone has had a similar problem,
&gt;your help would be much appreciated.

Your responses had great advice, most of which was to check that the
fuel lines were unclogged and that the fuel pump is pumping fuel.  I 
thoroughly checked all fuel lines(no clogs) and the fuel pump is indeed
pumping fuel.  So, I assume the culprit to be the carburetor. I check all
of its electrical connections and fiddle with the valve on top of the 
carburetor(where the air cleaner connects) then decide to try and see if it
starts. It starts right up!

Two days later it won't start again. Again, I fiddle with the carburetor and
once more made sure the fuel pump is pumping fuel. Still won't start. It does 
have gas, by the way.  So, I take the carburetor off, look at its insides, 
things look OK(nothing loose or free), clean it up then put it back on. 
Nothing.

I just need some confirmation here that all these events tell me I need a
new carburetor.  If not, what have I over looked? 

How much are new, rebuilt, or used carburetors? I have a 1600cc SP engine.

Thanks,
