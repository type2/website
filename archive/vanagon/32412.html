Subject: List Sticker Update

Howdy all.
After snow had everything shut down for the last few days, I finally got back
in touch with the printer to confirm the order. Anyway, here's the latest word:
 Apparently he thought he could use a standard die to cut the oval shaped
stickers. However, that die was only for paper stickers, not for vinyl,
SOOOOOO, there is a different die that must be used, with the addition of an
$84.00 die charge. Basically this means two things:
1. the stickers will now be 5 inches by 3 inches (oval shaped)
2. You *ALL* better buy stickers, as I pretty much have to sell a whole bunch
now to cover the cost.
Anyway, prices will remain the same, since I've already received some orders.
So, get those orders rolling, please!
:)
