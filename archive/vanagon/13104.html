Subject: Accordian Thermostats

Whoops, sorry about the last non-informational post...

Does anyone know of a cure  for these thermostats? Mine was broken when I bought
my '82 Westy. I replaced it and within 6 months I noticed that it was dead 
again. The failure is that the coppper bellows just stretch out permanently (no 
longer thermally activated). I guess its not a big deal in mild climates where I
am, but what do the eskimo-type folks do in Minnesota?

&gt; My '80 Vanagon has about 173K miles.  Original engine went about 155K 
&gt; fairly reliable miles (main problems were oil leaks and a couple of bad
&gt; lifters, and that damn accordian thermostat kept failing)...
