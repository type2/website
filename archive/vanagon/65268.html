From:         Gary A Meek &lt;meek_at_OANET.COM&gt;
Subject:      Yokohama Y370G data

        After being fed up with the prospect of replacing my
Continental T760 tires for the third time due to tire defects,
(the tires were not round; tread would wear more on one
side than 180 degrees away. Those Conties were the worst
tire I have ever had, with the lowest miles before they wore
out.  Are there other Conti tire models for the Vanagon that
are good?) I've returned the tires to Continental for credit.

        I bought the Yokohama Y370 as praised by many
list-members.  I bought the light truck version, which does
NOT have a mileage warranty.  The passenger car version
has a 60K mile warranty.  I was tempted to get the passenger
version (presumeably two fewer plies?) in order to get the
warranty, as I drive like an old grampa, and would not over
stress the tires.  In the end, however, I chose the light truck
version.  It cost CDN$ 107.00 ( US$ 77.00) My only complaint
is that the ride seems a lot harder (with 33 psi) in the 13 miles
I have put on the new tires.  Also, the side wall says that I have
the Y370B.  Do I have an earlier version, and should I go back
and get the suffix &quot;G&quot;  ?? Has anyone sufficient experience
with these tires to say that they got at least 60K miles out of
'em before they turned bald? (The tires, that is!)

Anyway, the data follows:

                                                              need 820 revs
per mile)
