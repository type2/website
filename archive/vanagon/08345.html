Subject: Vanagon Rough Idle

Can anyone tell me why my van idles so rough?  I've had the thing tuned several
times.  Each time it comes back fro the dealer, it seems to idle worse.  The
dealer say it's the way they run. I find that hard to believe. I've adjusted the
throttle valve switch, timing, changed the plugs, O2 sensor, but no change.  The
van idles great when cold, but after warming up it goes back to normal.......
(bad).  Has anyone had a similiar problems with their vanagon?  My 1978 bus
idles much better.
