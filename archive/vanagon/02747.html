&gt; Be sure to have a Coleman lantern.  I know alot of you hate
&gt; them but I just gotta have one.  The debate goes on and on
&gt; as to which is better (propane or gas).  I have a gas one
&gt; because it was given to me. 
&gt;
We bought a Coleman battery-operated lantern that uses a florescent
bulb - it runs off 4 (or is it 6?) D-size batteries and does a decent
job of providing general lighting - not great for reading, but
adequate.  This ran about $25.

We did this to avoid buring fuel in Cassie - I don't want the canvas
poptop to become an unwanted campfire. Same goes if you ever do any
tent camping - you can have this lantern in the tent.

For outside use, we have a smaller Coleman gas lantern - we bought it
for backpacking, but it's great for Cassie since it is smaller and
easier to store - you do have to refuel more often. This ran ~$45.

Good luck.

Steve
