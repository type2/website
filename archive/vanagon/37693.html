Sorry everybody, I guess I am using this Friday non veedub thing to the max.
I also find myself fired up, full of piss and vinegar if you will.
My response to this-
&gt;I'm surprised to read sharp minds on the list implying that there is some
clear boundary between good, ecological things and bad, dirty things.
Inexcusably, we all drive fossil-fueled vehicles made from pit-mined
iron ore.  We've already decided to compromise the environment; now we're
dickering about who gets to choose how.

IS this.. 
&gt;From the second you are born you begin to take from the system, all living
things do, that is not really the point. The point is how much you want to
take from the system. Do you want to drive a car that gets 10 mpg four blocks
to the post office to drop off a letter? When you are done drinking a soda do
you want to throw the can out the window? Do you want to buy a new car every
model year just because your present car isn't the latest and greatest? Do
you need to wipe your butt with paper made from virgin trees versus recycled
so you can have that &quot;angel softness&quot; feeling? We are all carnivores, some of
us are just more glutinous than others.

O.K. All done.....
Have a great weekend everyone
Kevin
