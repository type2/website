Subject: evaluating/storing an engine


I recently bought a 1600 dp engine with about 8,000
miles on it.  (It is a GEX rebuild from about 5 years 
ago--hopefully before their change of ownership and
all the recent complaints).  I was not in pressing
need, it came with a bunch of other parts that I
did need/want and was cheap.

My questions are, can I evaluate this engine in any
way without actually sticking it in my bus?  Checking
the endplay I want to do (as soon as I get one of
those widgets for doing so).  Any other ideas?

My other concern is, what should I do now that
I have this engine sitting in my little shed where
it is likely to stay for months?  There are rags
in the manifold openings.  I have been advised to
remove the rocker arms to prevent some valve springs
from sitting compressed.  It has no oil in it.

Any advice appreciated,

Mark
