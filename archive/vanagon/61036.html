Went to my garage, tested co.  3%  went back to the emissions place, same
lane.  Nobody would drive the car this time!  I drove it into the stall and
only was given a tailpipe test.  I had to rev the engine to about 2500 rpm
to give it enough to sniff.  Passed with flying colors!!  Which leads me to
believe:
1.  the operator is just a moron, as well as the manager
2.  Something criminal is going on where the operator is manipulating the
dyno test to fail people and make some $$$4

will post with my results from the state as soon as I call them on Monday


thanks everyone for your support!!!!!
