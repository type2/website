Subject: van's I've seen

following the thread about the number of VWs in the Seattle area - they're
not just in the university district, there are also many downtown. I think
with the all moisture they must be breeding at this time of year.

Typically in the Pioneer Square area where I work, I see at least 6-7
various VW's a day. Today for example: 2 EVs (one MV, one not), 1 primered
split-window (with the overhanging roof), a late model Westfalia, and a
most unusual white Vanagon: instead of the chrome &quot;Vanagon&quot; logo on the
back, it had chrome letters spelling &quot;VaVaVan&quot; and above this was a
stylized stick figure with a VW logo for a head - looked like a decal - all
in blue.
