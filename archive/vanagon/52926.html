&gt; After dropping the gas tank to have a leak repaired, my faithful companion
&gt; refuses to start. Turning the key brings on the usual lights, but the engine
&gt; won't crank over. The battery is fully charged and I've had the starter
&gt; checked and cleaned all the crud off of the contacts, but still no go. The
&gt; really scary part is that I think the engine is seized up because I can't
&gt; even turn the engine over by hand. How could this happen? The thing ran like
&gt; a champ before having the tank r&amp;r'ed. It did set for a few weeks, but I've
&gt; done that before and had no problem getting her/him to run. 
&gt; 
&gt; I guess the bottom line is: What magic spirit do I use to un-seize the engine?

oh boy!! oh boy...is the clutch pedal seeming to work ok? what about 
neutral...

let me think...flywheel caught up on something? starter spin? does it 
engauge?

engine mount bolts good and tight?

you didnt have the plugs out while it sat, did ya?

hmm...if all that is ok, then i'd say squirt some oil in the plug 
holes...a goodly amount maybe...and CAREFULLY start wiggleing the engien 
backand forth....move at all? if not, there is always the brute force mthod..

tow it, or push it down a goo hill......cluch in, tranny in anywhere 
between 2 and 4...your personal preference...and hope it gets it 
moving...try it w/ ignition OFF, since you just want to free the engien up...

just random thoughts...others can prolly help more.....david
