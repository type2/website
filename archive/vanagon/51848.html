&gt; I have recently had a lot of work done on my 86' including a
&gt; rebuilt engine from AVP, new clutch, and new idle stabilizer.
&gt; Recently i took the van back in because of the following:
&gt; with the ac on, the idle is very high and the idle stabilizer
&gt; stays on.
&gt; This problem is quite mysterious to me, but I think this is
&gt; definitely something that should be covered under my 90 days
&gt; parts and labor warranty.  My mechanic does not seem to agree
&gt; with me.  In any case, if there is something wrong with the ac
&gt; unit, it is soemthing they did reassembling the engine
&gt; as it worked fine before having the rebuilt engine put in.
&gt; My mechanics solution to the problem of the high idle was to
&gt; keep the ac off and re-adjust the idle.  Now the engine stalls
&gt; when cold and the idle searches a little, but is fine and
&gt; smooth when warm.  Is this a sign of a vacuum leak, or can this
&gt; be linked to the idle stab.??  To top it all off, i just
&gt; realized that my back-up lights are not working, and it is not
&gt; the fuse or the lamps.
&gt;         I think that i need to make a list of things that are
&gt; obviously done half-ass and go threaten my mechanic.  The
&gt; problem is that i am not sure that I have the expertise to
&gt; recognize all of these things. If there is anyone in the 100
&gt; mile radius, ie. D.C , Richmond, BLacksburg, Roanoak or
&gt; possibly further that could help me locate and distinguish
&gt; these problems i would greatly appreciate it.  I think that my
&gt; mechanic is trying to take advantage of me b/c I am a 24 year
&gt; old out of state grad student in a predominantly college town.
&gt; Thanks in advance for any help/advice.
