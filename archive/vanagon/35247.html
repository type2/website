Subject: The '65 (actually '64) pick is MINE!!
Date: Tue, 13 Feb 1996 17:45:17 -0800 (PST)

Hi All!

Well, as the subject line says, I plunked down the holding
deposit and will be picking up the '64 beauty this weekend.

This also means &quot;I'M AIR-COOLED AGAIN!!&quot;  Hard to believe
that I've maintained the air-cooled FAQ without having
an air-cooled VW for about 7 years.  PSHAW!!!  :)

Major Kudos to Thom Fitzpatrick and my wife.  To Thom for
locating this find with many pluses.  To my wife for letting
me buy it with mucho mis-giving vibes showing all over her
face.  But I know that it will be a good investment in the
long run, even though I took the money from my stock.  I
think my decision will clearly be the winner.

Honorable mention to Martha, although her choices of phrasing
and general cajoling required a few points to be deducted. ;)

Heart-felt thanks to others of you for understanding words 
about my predicament.

As I said before, I will be picking it up on Saturday and will
be driving it about once a week.  For the present, I'll be 
taking steps to eradicate the rust and prevent further rust
from forming.  I'm hoping that Thom can help in that department.
After that, it will have to wait for it's restoration as I
need to build up the money and time to do the job.  I will
do as much prep work as time will allow.  I have other chores
that will keep me busy for at least a year and I suspect it
will take me longer than that to complete some of them, but
I will get to the pickup eventually.  Hopefully, I will do
a restoration that will be deserving of this pickup. 

Not too much is needed as far as external bits are concerned.  
This presumes that any terrorists in the area don't engage in 
'sticky fingered' activities as the truck must sit outside.  
Unless of course, we win the Lotto. ;)  

The interior is in unusually good condition except that the
upolstery needs replacing and some rust areas on the floor.

(for the vanagon list):
So, without further ado, UNCA JOEL, please change the stats
and add a '64 pick-em-up.
