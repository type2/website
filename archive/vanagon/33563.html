Subject: Re: stretch net for 'falia luggage racks

Speaking of luggage racks ... did VW ever carry an official accessory 
roof rack for the Vanagon era (non-pop-tops).  Not that I need one.  I 
just bought a &quot;Safari Rack&quot; (used once, 10 ft. long, 5&quot; sides, wood 
slats).  Like the kind you see on river rafting company vans.  Looks real 
good on the Vanagon.  Now when I haul sh*t, it won't have to ride inside 
with the carpet and cloth seats. :-)
