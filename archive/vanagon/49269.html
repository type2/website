Subject: '81 Vanagon L being parted out 

I have an '81 Vanagon L for sale in Denver. The motor and trans are 
already
gone,
but everything else is still there. It has no rust, but some slight 
damage
near the left turn signal. I am asking $350, it has a clear CO title. I 
would
also consider parting it out, if I do not sell the Van as a whole. 
Please
E-mail if interested.
Thanks,
Josh
