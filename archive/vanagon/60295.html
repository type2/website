Mark,

&lt;&lt;   The site promised a RV and recreational area soon. So what!,
probably the same tire.  &gt;&gt;

   I doubt that!  The tires on a 37 foot Fleetwood Bounder
are slightly larger than 185x70.  Probably a ply or two more in the
sidewalls as well.  &lt;G D&amp;R&gt;   Seriously, thanks for the research.
