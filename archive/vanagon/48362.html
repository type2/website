Subject: Shakedown cruise

Hi VWers,

I took my 84 VW to Wi for a Vanation and to visit the
relatives.  It was a real shake down cruise.

The temp gauge stopped working, the oil sensor kept
going on, the engine started running funny and the
muffler seem to have developed  a hole up by the
manifold.

I did not bring my manual so I need your help.

To replace the temp gauage, where is it?  Is the guage
the same as the switch on the bototom of the radiator?

The oil sensor was just shorted out, the wire was
hitting the muffler, the insulation melted and so
it shorted out.

The engine power was not consistent, it had lots
of power once in a while and other times it hesistated
a lot when trying to accelerate.  Could it be the ground
wire again?  The engine backfired a couple of times, one time
when I left off the gas.

Thanks for any help,

Jim Ferree
84 Vanagon
