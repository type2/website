Subject: Re: Clutch Pedal &amp; Clutch cylinder rod Q

Well This has got to be one for the record book!


&gt; The clutch pedal has over an inch of free play, &amp; I mean free play. 
&gt; Any advice will be greatly appreciated. 

  I HAVE  ADVICE for all!   Oil Your clutch linkage!

   I have the same problem. Drove from PA to OH, to Erik O's for some
   parts, this clutch linkage was one of them. After removing the
   dash and the entire pedel assembly from the top, (it's the
   only way it will come out), we found it to, to be just as worn out!
   Obviously this is a common problem. My other Vanagon is in good
   shape. As I remember about  4 years ago the pedel was squeeking,
   so I did what anyone who could see the parts would do, oiled it!
   The only problem is that you cann't see what your oiling!
       OIL YOUR CLUTCH LINKAGE!
