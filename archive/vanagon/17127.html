     Hi folks,
     
     Just gotta tell y'all about last weekend...
     
     Saturday:
     
     Arrived at the Wolvey camp site where the splittie owners club were 
     meeting - yawn plenty of flat caps around, then the &quot;boys&quot; arrived 
     around tea time. Rikki in his white/red 61 samba, Richard drivin' 
     Rikkis 67 samba (the purple and white, with banana upholstery), Sparky 
     in his '58 23 window (RHD Swedish import), Vaun in the that lobster 
     and white 21 window, Meryll in his new stock panel van, and Jules in 
     the KK panel van. 
     
     We had a barbecue courtesy of the splittie club and then some nutty 
     guy played an organ and sung sad cockney style (no offence meant) type 
     pub songs. Anyway there was a raffle and I won a bulb kit - you know 
     the little blue ones with a selection of 12v bulbs.
     
     
     Sunday:
     
     *MAJOR* cruze (caravan) down to Stanford hall - an amazing sight, 64 
     splits in a line on the M1 stretching 1.5 miles long!!! We (the samba 
     boys) formed our own little unofficial samba display which looked 
     cool. Great meeting for a family (you didn't have to worry about your 
     bus there) and I really liked the venue. I had spent 100 quid in about 
     5 minutes and this is what I got:
     
     o    2 x genuine Hella red/amber rear lights, almost NOS   - 20
     o    ashtray and holder - zero rust                        - 8
     o    five 1/2 rusty popouts (makes 2 1/2 complete popouts) - 20
     o    set of 40/44 Kadrons, complete                        - 50
     o    washer bottle top                                     - 2
     o    wiper arm                                             - 50p
     
     We stayed at Stanford until the KK boys had shut up shop (5:30pm) then 
     headed off to the Pod. We stopped at a Beefeater and had a feast - 
     some local *twat* let one of Rikkis tires down on his 23 - matchstick 
     in the valve job.
     
     Arrived at the Pod around 9:00pm and set up at the far side of the 
     drag strip then enjoyed the night.
     
     
     Monday:
     
     I put the samba in the show'n'shine along with Merylls panel van - he 
     won :(  nice bus though. Now there was this '57 Oval up for raffle and 
     when they were maneuvering it on the trailer the towing range-rover 
     caught and dented one of my front overiders - I couldn't believe it, 
     it was Ok though because there were about 1000 witnesses! the guy gave 
     me 25 quid plus two tickets to Bug Jam. I played dumb like I didn't 
     know a spanner from a paintbrush - truth is I'll have the dint out and 
     overider painted by tonight, he he - see yer at Bug Jam. Well I didn't 
     win the Oval - I really wanted it and I would have given it to Helen 
     (SO) if I had've won it. Saw the jet and rocket cars for the first 
     time - awesome, oh and we got covered in HO5 (hydrogen peroxide) 
     rocket fuel coz the wind was in the wrong direction. After the raffle 
     was announced I set off home (about 4:00pm)
     
     A good weekend all round, and the gearbox noise didn't rear its head 
     so I guess it was lack of oil.
