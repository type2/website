Subject:      Coleman lantern?



In his suggested list Steve mentions a Coleman lantern, gas or propane. He
says he has gas only because it was given to him. What about the Coleman
electric? An add for it says it can be charged off of 120 or 12volt. It could
be charged while driving and the charge is supposed to last 4 hours using both
light tubes and 7&gt;8 using only one. Are these any good, it seems like a lot
friendlier way to go, eh?
