Subject: Emissions (CO) still out...

Hi All,
To all of you that told me that richening the mixture would bring the CO 
down, I say: booshwa.  Richening (dialing in the mixture screw) just sent 
the CO through the roof.  Leaning it out brought up below 1% (spec 1.5%).

The problem I have now is that I can't get it below 2% at 2400 rpm no 
matter what I do.  Any one have any ideas what could be wrong now?  HC is 
good no matter what the rpms.

Any ideas/help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Jack
