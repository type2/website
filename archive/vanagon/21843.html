Subject: RE: engine swap\oil cooler


---  mail from GDURSTEW_at_oimb.uoregon_dot_edu

&gt; i just read in muir's that he suggests replacing the oil cooler every &gt; time
&gt;you pull the engine - any opinions on that ? that's a spendy part, 144.-

I had also read that recently too, because I have been trying to keep my
new ('70) bus as cool as possible out here in Arizona. It had sat for about
2 years. Can the oil cooler get gummed up and full of crud by sitting?
Can it be flushed out without taking out the engine (although I probably should
remove it to make sure the fan is completely clear also)
