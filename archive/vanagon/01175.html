Subject: Re: O2 and H2O HOT

The O2 sensor seems a might pricey, ie dealer$, Disconnnecting it is the 
right first step, not great for your lungs however. Your water problem is 
due to the idiocy of VW putting the radiator cap at almost the lowest point 
in the circuit. What is happening is that even though the water level is OK 
when you check it parked wih the engine off there is an enormous air bubble 
inside your heater core up front, the high point of the circuit. Once the 
water pump starts spinning, it builds up enough pressure in the circuit to 
compress the air bubble and your coolant level at the pump drops down below 
the pump inlet level. Voila, no real pumping, temperature rockets up, you 
warp your heads and/or cook those big expensive head gaskets. It's all down 
hill after that! You can check for the air bubble by turning on the front 
heat. If the windshield air is warm/hot  no problem, but if it is cool (and 
floor air is hot) your heater core is half full of air and you need to bleed 
the system, see Bentley. Leaking head gaskets can also let air into the 
coolant system, aggravating the problem. Once  the pump starts leaking 
around its shaft the coolant level will drop below the pump inlet etc. etc.. 
This is what got me, and now, one pump, new gaskets on one side, it runs 
again, but the other side is dripping. An air cooled vanagon is tempting 
indeed.    tjs
