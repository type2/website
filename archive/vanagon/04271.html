Subject:       I hate you Meeses to pieces

A day or two back, one of our number was complaining about 
co-habiting his Westy with mice.  I had a mouse experience that may 
shed a light on the probable entry point of the little critters at 
least for Vanagons.  On my monumental trip across the contintent a 
few weeks ago, the last encampment in the woods was in the B.C. 
Cayuse Flats Provincial Park. Anyway I pulled over at a trailhead 
parking area about midnite all the campgrounds were full, and tucked 
myself in.  Woke with a start a couple hours later hearing gnawing 
sounds.  Had visions of porcupines eating brake hoses as recounted by 
someone long ago on this list (I think).  Even got out my flashlight 
and peered under the van; nobody in sight.  Anyway heard the 
crunching a couple more times, but sort of got used to it and went on 
my way in the morning.  When I got to my daughters place in Richmond, 
I had to fuss with the passenger side window mechanism and as I 
working, suddenly I noticed a big-eared field mouse sitting on the 
door jamb next to the seat looking rather disoriented.  I now knew 
who had been doing the munching.  I reached over and flicked him/her 
onto the ground where it scurried away toward the bushes. I went on 
about my repairs and about 10 minutes later, mouse reappeared, 
climbed up the front tire, jumped over to the lip of the front fender 
overhang, and about 2 minutes later re-appeared on the door margin 
from under the front dash area.  This time he was NOT released to 
return again.  I have not gone over that underbody area with a fine-
tooth comb yet, but there must be an entry point there somewhere.

Joel, this list is loaded with callow youths, Korean Conflict ? I can 
remember VE Day and VJ day and trainloads of trucks, Jeeps,  Tanks 
etc. heading to the west coast port for the pacific war.  However 
just to maintain my perspective, my landlady during my sabbatical 
here in Victoria calls me 'young man'.  Her late husband was in the 
air force, Battle of Britain during that one.
