In my '69 walk-thru in Ft. Collins, CO in the mid '80s, we put:

4 tubas
5 people
2 ice chests
3 packing boxes of munchies
5 Colorado-type winter jackets

...and we partied hardy before each and every CSU Rams football game
for two years!

The partying was necessary (as if we needed an excuse), because the
Rams for those two years compiled a record of 2 and 22.  :(

But the marching band was great. Just ask us!
