Subject: Re: ADVICE NEEDED.

&gt;&gt; Thanks Todd-
&gt;&gt; I am currently the owner of a light cream (impossible to match paint) 76' 
&gt;&gt; Mercades Benz 300D.  With 163K on the all original engine which has just 
&gt;&gt; sprung a leak from the front main seal.  Here's the catch- you can't buy one 
&gt;&gt; seal... you have to buy the whole gasket set.  Wanna know how much? $260.  I 
&gt;&gt; know about hard to find parts and so on.  It still has all orig. exhaust on 
&gt;&gt; it which needs to be replaced. Around $550 for parts alone!!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Until about 4 weeks ago the car had no blower motor.  The heat had to be on 
&gt;&gt; par with that of a VW.
&gt;[...] 
&gt;&gt; When I was very young my dad rebuilt VW's all the time.  He had a 64' bug 
&gt;&gt; and a 72' SB.
&gt;&gt; I'm hooked.

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;Ok, so it seems that you at least know what you're getting into!
&gt;(big grin)
&gt;
&gt;So how can we help? Questions on setup?  What to do about the
&gt;engine? Paint tips? Go for it!  By the way, where are you
&gt;located, and do you have an e-mail address?

I guess this one is a campmobile then.  It has a fiberglass roof with a seam 
just behind the cab.

A couple of questions for todd-
you also have a 71 campmobile?-what kinda milage do you get?- on what kinda 
engine?
I am located in Christiansburg, VA.
email at cbridge_at_vt_dot_edu (simple!!)
also- I'm a junior at Virginia Tech- Electrical Engineering.
There are tons of VW's here in the mountains.  Almost none for sale.

About the engine-  It was rebuilt by some garage- after which these 3 girls 
drove around the country for the summer.  They put 60-80k on it when the 
present owner bought it for &quot; a couple grand&quot;.  She doesn't know anything 
mechanical and has had a idiot work on it here in town.  charged her $400 to 
helicoil a spark plug hole and do a valve job on one head!!.
The only thing that I think might be good is the case- but it might be 
trashed.  Anyway I know of a AE block that is mostly there and also siezed 
for 50 buck at a FLAR.

Do you know if all AE blocks have crossmember holes?

Thanks again Todd and all you guys (gender neutral) out there.
