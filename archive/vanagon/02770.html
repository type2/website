Subject: Syncro off road?

I currently a Vanagon wannabe - had a '70 and a '78 camper and miss them 
terribly.  I'm shopping for a late Vanagon, 91 to 89 or so, maybe a 
multivan, and I'm wondering if it's worth looking for a Syncro.  Are they 
any good off road, or is the 4wd just for poor traction conditions on 
pavement?  Are they especially troublesome?  Are parts a problem?
