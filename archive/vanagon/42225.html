Subject: FOR SALE: '90 Weekender (Multivan) Austin, TX

I was considering purchasing this van because my dad wanted my '89 Westy
(full camper).  When I finally told him that I was ready to sell him mine,
he told me that he wasn't interested any more.  So, I'm not going to buy the
'90 Multivan.  The van is in good shape and the owner is asking $12,500.

If you are interested, call Todd Rayborn, (512)451-4863 or go buy 3120
Guadalupe if you happen to be in Austin.
