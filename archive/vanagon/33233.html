Hi all its been four months or thereabouts since I last posted to the
list. The 82 has been in storage for about a month now, but recent
discussions have piqued my interest.  Work plus
raising a one year old has kept me away. It is Friday afternoon, the house
is leaking from the huge amount of snow we have had and I am desperately
avoiding writing that chapter on peacekeeping in Bosnia.

Here goes:

1) in October we suffered a rear tire blowout. Both rears (X's) were
replaced by
ZXZ Michelins which appear to have superior gripping power in the snow
(of which there has been plenty until today when it started raining here).

2) Drove the Vanagon from Ottawa to Toronto in December at - 20 C temps.
The Van has no gas heater installed yet (it will be done in the spring).
Believe me even with the in-line aux fan the Van is just too spacious to heat.
The heat from the vents is hot but the space to fill is too large; tried
the curtain idea with mixed results. A five hour drive with most
extremeties stiff from the cold.

3) Previous to driving to the van to TO - we had immense snow build up on all
roofs (including the vanagon). Efforts to dislodge the snow with a hose by
the fellow who was oil spraying and cleaning it, led to near disaster. The
snow and water froze creating a very top heavy Westfalia. Needless to say
going around corners was tricky. A half day breaking up the ice helped a lot.

4) have been using Castrol Syntec 5W50 even in very cold temps. Synthetic
has been there since 10,000 miles on a GEX rebuild. I am very pleased with the
oil though I make no claims about increased engine or oil life. Cold -25 C
weather starts are much easier and the oil light never goes on. pressure
is good.

5) In the summer, the Westy's roof was patched with gelcoat and then painted
with boat
enamel. The results were good, but immense scrubbing is in order before
painting. I did claim  the 2mpg increase but was joking...what if anything
could result in a huge change? 

6) The Westy's clutch pedal froze a few times in December when it was very
cold here. In essence the seals shrink slightly when frozen, the fluid
leaks out of the clutch and voila no clutch action. Solution? Take a blow
dryer and heat up the clutch pedal assembly and master cylinder; the seals
swell and pressure can be pumped up again to normal levels. Obviously I
will need to replace the seals come spring.

That's about it.

Cheers - DC
