&gt;&gt;David says he cleans the screen and I can't argue with him too much.  OTOH,
&gt;&gt;I don't.

&gt;All I can offer is that sometimes I do find debris in the screen.  Usually
&gt;looks like small pieces of gasket material and other unidentifiable stuff.
&gt;If you found any metal in there, it could serve as an early warning for
&gt;engine trouble whereas most of us don't cut open our oil filters to see
&gt;what they caught...

Heavy stuff will tend to fall straight down and not circulate. I pulled the
pickup tube on a watercooled I'm overhauling last weekend. It has a screen,
and the screen was 3/4 full of chunks of RTV sealant and chips of carbon.
This vehicle has a perfectly good oil filter system but that didn't save
the screen from being nearly clogged.
