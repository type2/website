&gt; I was wondering if anyone has ordered a rebuilt engine from GEX
International
&gt; out of California?  A neighbor of mine put one in his bug and has put
over
&gt; 70,000 miles on it and it runs strong.  I have visited their website and
have
&gt; their catalog and they seem to have a very good set up.  Has anyone
ordered
&gt; one of the engines and if so did you ever have to test out their
garantee.
&gt;  Before I lay down 2 grand I'd like some feedback. 


Don,
Before ordering from GEX I would strongly advise checking the Vanagon list
archives.  There is information on them there that you may want to read. 
If you cannot find it, p-mail me.
