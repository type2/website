Subject: Delightful diesel.  Delicious!

The two diesel T4s on the list are both Irish.  I've the 1.9L 
4-cylinder and my pal, John Galvin, has a 2.4L 5-cylinder.  If 
you want to haf spek wiz heem, he's on galvo_at_iol.ie

E-mail him directly, 'coz he is in digest mode.

Diesels are delightful.

I've not been in the Rockies, but I've tried to go up the 
Rocky-road, a local woodland track.  And both the blue thing 
and I are alive to tell the tale.

&gt;I'm interested in hearing from anyone who owns or has 
&gt;driven one of these.  I'm considering the diesel over 
&gt;the gas version, mainly because of its fuel economy (I 
&gt;realize air isn't available in the diesels).  How 
&gt;reliable is the 2.4 5-cylinder?  (my '92 Turbo Diesel 
&gt;Jetta has been wonderful, but I only have 96k on it).  
&gt;I couldn't care less about HP, as long as I can 
&gt;*eventually* get up to highway speed limit.  Anyone 
&gt;driven one of these through the Rockies?
