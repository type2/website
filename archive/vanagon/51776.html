 Has anyone had any experience in running a rigid clutch disk on a
 Wasserboxer?  I don't care for the spongey feel of the spring disk,
 although it may be easier on the tranny.  Perhaps one out of a Porsche 914
 or something would work?  TIA &gt;&gt;


With the way parts inside these trannys like to break and crack, I would not
even consider it.  The spring center and cushions between the disks do an
awful lot to keep the engine vibrations from transferring to the gears.
