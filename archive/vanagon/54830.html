Subject: Re: Rear Hatch Struts


&gt;I had been looking all over town and throughout the net for a set of rear 
&gt;hatch struts for my 83 Westy (no rear wiper).  I got a tip from a a fellow 
&gt;list member, Scott Maurer, who told me to try Halsey Import Auto Parts
&gt;(800) 792-0081.
&gt;I'm sure glad that I did.  When I called they didn't have any in stock,
&gt;but they now have  (40) pairs. oops! 39 pairs in stock.  I called all over
&gt;town and surfed the net, and found prices ranging from $80/set (Dealer) to 
&gt;$50.00/set.
&gt;
&gt;They are the correct German part and are identical to the existing ones in 
&gt;my Westy. The only difference is that the new ones don't have the VW/Audi 
&gt;Logo on them.  I paid $31.00 for the set.  
&gt;
Are these the OEM manufacturer (Sachs/Boge, but not labeled as such on the 
strut), or the Suspanders brand that has gotten some bad press on the list? 
(Be careful - both are German.)  If they are not Suspanders, that's indeed 
a very good price.
