Subject: Eurovan SYNCRO!!!

While driving a rented Suzuki on Phuket Island, Thailand,  I was passed by a
Eurovan which I later caught up with.  I noticed the tires were larger than
normal and it set diferently than other Eurovans...  It was a while before I
saw the &quot;Syncro&quot; emblem on the rear.  This was right hand drive etc. 

I lost him in traffic, so there was no chance to see if the emblem was a joke
or for real...

Has anyone heard of a Syncro Eurovan,  or have I been in Thailand too long???
