The armrest/door pull will unscrew, as will the window crank.  Carefully pry
back the black plastic cover that makes your metal window crank look pretty,
look underneath, and you'll find the screw.  After that, get a long, thin
screwdriver under one corner of the door panel and gently pry up.  The little
door-tab thingees that attach this panel should release fairly easy.  And now
you have access to the door guts.....and your parking sticker.....  :-)
