Subject: 	Re: Sunroof Question: Part II

Never say never. Just about everything was an option and even =
combinations
that are supposed to be impossible managed to sneak out of the factory.
---
yes- that's who i put that qualifyer in there.  But why would someone =
want
that?

BTW, while we're talking about wierd combinations, did you see the =
picture
of a '63 bus with a sliding door in V*lksw*rld a while ago. At least I =
think
it was a '63, it was definitely earlier than '67 when these were =
supposed to
be first available.
-----

sliding doors were available as an option in 63.  I have seen a picture =
of a
deluxe w/ sunroof and sliding doors both sides.    The middle seat =
flipped
down on both sides.

I also have seen two (identical, in different places) green and white 64
sliding sunroof microbuses with sliding doors and locking steering =
columns.


I was talking to guy recently about a double sliding door deluxe that he =
saw one time.  He said that he thinks it is in Michigan,  some guy is =
just holding on to it.  He dosen't plan on restoring it,  what a =
shame:-(.
