Subject: '71 single cab pickup?

There's an ad in the local swap rag:

71 VW Single Cab Pickup $585

It caught my eye, but the wife says &quot;I don't wanna pickup; I wanna
splittie.&quot;  I'm still thinking tho.  If it's in decent shape, is this
a deal not to be passed up?  I suspect they're fairly rare, but how
much so?

Thanks,

-Mitch

P.S. It's near Auburn, CA.  If you are interested (and I don't wind up
with it :-), drop me a line and I'll point you at it.
