&lt;&lt;  This list is a better source of information, entertainment, etc. than
 Hot VWs or VW Trends....its more accurate, probably less biased (we don't
 cater to advertisers) and more immediate (you don't have to wait for months
 or years for the info you want to appear). &gt;&gt;

I'd have to agree with RGolen.

This list provides dense, targeted information about EXACTLY what I want to
know about, without any clutter: ads, stuff about cars I DON'T own, articals
(sic) about things I don't care about, etc.

Further: Why kill more trees, turn them into pulp, only to throw them into a
hole in the ground? Why should I advocate ANOTHER piece of paper in
circulation if I can possibly avoid it? (Sorry to anyone in the
paper/tree/pulp industry, a pet peeve.)

Finally: I value my half hour a day with my pals on the VW list, people I
have come (in some way) to care about; but it is tough to find time for that.
There's no way I could find time to read a paper magazine, especially one
written by writers out for a buck, who I really don't care as much about.
I'll stick with the list.

My vote: &quot;NAY&quot;
