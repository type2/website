Subject: Re: gas heaters


I have a factory gas heater in my '81 Vanagon.  In fact,
that's why I bought it in January '82--I was tired of being
cold in my '76 that didn't have an auxiliary heater.  

I do use it camping.  It has a timer and will run for ~10
minutes (on &quot;half speed&quot;) without the engine running.

I'd be happy to answer questions or give a summary of it
if others are interested.

I noticed that in the Bentley manual, that there are various
gas auxilary heaters that work through the normal vent channels.
The specific heater system I'm referring to attaches under
the vanagon and is routed into the ducting somehow.  Now can 
this system also be used for stationary uses e.g. camping?
And why wasn't this option available in the U.S.?  I'd presume
it was a safety issue, but I don't know for sure.  Can anyone
enlighten me more about these systems and if there is a possibility
of integrating one into my van, I'd like to hear about it.
