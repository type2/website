&gt;Coooooooooool!

The original owner of my bus had air conditioning installed at the dealer.
It was manufactured by COOL for VW.  So, yes, it was coooool.

I removed it long ago because I kept hitting my shin/knee on the
damn thing under the dash.  It also really taxed the poor little
straining motor (1.7L w/carbs).
