Subject: swing axle camber question

Hi there.  My '62 Kombi is on the road and driving well, esp. with
its new brake light switch (god bless John Muir, just followed
the Procedure, bought the part he said to buy (actually in stock
at the local import FLAPS) and it worked :-)  ).

My rear end looks like this (my BUS rear end, you silly people):

\---/

I know the rear wheels are supposed to angle out at the top
somewhat but it looks like too much.  The tires are
P205/70R15's which is pretty fat, I guess, and they come
about 1 inch or less from touching the inner lip of the
wheel well.

So, if you all have any info and/or comments about

what's the correct camber for my rear wheels and can
it be adjusted

tires, what about these fat babies.  The PO said the
wheels were &quot;Beetle&quot; wheels, (15 inch, 5 lug is correct
for '62 buses, I think, but I don't know about the width)

playing organ for), so I guess I trust it to get me there :---)   )
