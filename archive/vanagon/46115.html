&gt; My diesel has been overheating for the last 5 months. I can drive until 
&gt; the overheating light is on, then touch the radiator ANYWHERE with no

&gt; coolant(60%) and air(40%). After 3 or 4 minutes, the radiator is hot and 
&gt; the temperature starts to fall. But then I have to add a half gallon of 
&gt; coolant.
&gt; 
&gt; During the 5 months I have: replaced waterpump, replaced then removed 
&gt; thermostat, had radiator cleaned and rodded, replaced radiator-style cap, 
&gt; flushed system (5 times), bypassed oil cooler (found oil in coolant), and 
&gt; I have bled the _stupid_ system for 30++ hours.
&gt; 
&gt; What else can I do?
Replace the head gasket. This is a common failure for all VW diesels, 
and since you've eliminated just about any other source of 
coolant/air and coolant/oil leaks, it is almost certainly the head 
gasket. Since you're getting oil in the coolant, don't leave it any 
longer - you may warp the head (if not already), plug up your newly 
rebuilt rad with oil, and trash the engine bearings if you also get 
coolant in the oil.
Doing the work yourself will save a lot, although I'm not sure if you 
can remove the head without pulling the engine on a Vanagon diesel. 
Parts cost is about $100-150 including new head bolts and gaskets.
