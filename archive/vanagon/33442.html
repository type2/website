Subject: 85 waterboxer FINALLY runs!

Hey Volks,

I FINALLY figured out what was causing my engine problem with my 85 1.9l
waterboxer.  To recap, I had rebuilt the engine last summer.  Ever since
then, I have been able to start her up and drive her anywhere.  When I turned
it off, it would not restart for 30-45 minutes.

After months of reading Bentleys, advice from the list and a few choice words
and temper tantrums, I finaly figured it out.  I was about to through the
towell in when I got the phone number for a mechanic in the DC area that
specializes in water cooled VWs (and has a good reputation).  I explained the
problem to him and he thought it had to do with the water temperature sensor
that screws into the thermostat housing.  He suggested I check that out and
if I still couldn't get it working he would be able to look at  it in a
couple of weeks.

I founf the culprit.  A bad connection from the wire to the sensor.  Someone
on the list suggested I pull this off and reseat it to ensure a good
connection.  When I was pullinjg it off to check it, I noticed only 1 of the
2 contacts in the connector.  I pushed on the wires from the back side of the
connector and the other contact popped in place.  Come to find out, my
problem was caused because the computer didn't know the temperature and would
put more fuel in the system, thus causing the flooding.  With the connector
correctly installed the computer could accurateley guage the temp and process
fuel accordingly.

Whew!  Five months searching for a needle ...

BTW, my Vanagon floormats arrived no more than 10 minutes after I got it
runing.  Added just the right touch to a good day.  (The mats are cheap,
cheesey, ... but I like em!
