Subject: Heater cure

Hello; I found the solution for the heater fan on my 87 GL. The fuse was
good there was power going into the switch but no power out in any switch
position, when I jumped the terminals the fan ran.  I took the switch out
and apart, it looked ok inside I cleaned all the contacts and put it
together it would only work if I could push the plug on the back, or it
would work until I installed the switch then it wouldn't work.  No problem,
I just drive to the FLVWD, 100 miles away ask for a switch, prepare to
shocked at the ridiculous price, surprise it costs $6.05, emboldened by the
cost of the switch I ask the parts guy how much for the digital clock, since
it's constantly cycling.  He says that will be 269.99.  Back to reality.  I
changed the switch in the parking lot took about 5 mins. heater works great
no further problems.  Now I'll have to go out and find out where the power
steering fluid is going.                                 Larry Carter
