Subject: repairing new style bumpers

I have a problem because my front bumper is all skuffed up and in one place
there is a crack in the composite material that makes up this bumper. This
bumper is the new style black bumper, which I think were on 88 or 89 on up.

Has anybody given thought as to how to repair these bumpers?

I'm wondering whether to use bondo and black spray paint from the hardware
store. Somebody please stop me from doing this if there is a better way
