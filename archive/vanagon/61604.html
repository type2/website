Subject: Westfalia Pop Top Decals
Date: Thu, 19 Jun 1997 15:26:52 -0600

A local guy sells Westfalia pop top decals for a pretty reasonable price =
of $39.95 (front and back sticker) for standard colors (black, white, =
brown, red, silver) and $51.95 for custom colors (like reflective black, =
fluorescent colors, Zebra striped or tie died). =20

The decals are great.  I have searched everywhere and they can not be =
found.  I have reflective vinyl on my '84 Westy and it is very cool - it =
glows at night like a street sign - this is helpful when trying to hike =
back to the camper at night.  I saw the Zebra stripe on a white Westy =
that was really hip - I am sure the tied died looks great on older =
buses. =20

They are made from commercial vinyl and are guaranteed not to fade or =
un-adhere for five years.  His name is Dean and he is at =
elvis_at_unidial_dot_com or (303) 780-0483.=00=00
