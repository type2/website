Hi Jim -

Thanks again for forwarding more of the posts.  I was able to contact Gary
Gibson about his core charge refund that he never got.  This situation
happened in late 1988, long before I ever came on the scene (about 2 1/2
years ago), but I'm still gonna see what I can do.  He will be forwarding
copies of correspondence relating to the matter to me off of computer backup
copies he still has.  We still have paperwork files dating back to 1987 when
BBI started, but (Oh God :( ), I just cringe at the thought of trying to find
at anything that far back.  An invoice will suffice and his UPS paperwork
will help as well.  Even if this Boo-boo isn't my fault, I would still like
to make it right.  On ward and Upward as they say.

Jim
