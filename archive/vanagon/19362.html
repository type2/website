Subject: Re: rec.autos.vw call for votes


Hi folks -

Sorry to butt in, but if there is anyone out there that reads rec.autos.vw  
(the Usenet news group) on a regular basis, I thought you'd want to know that  
the &quot;CFV&quot; (call for votes) for the proposed re-organization of that group will  
officially start on or near June 27.

If passed, the re-org will split the group into two groups, one for aircooled  
VW's and one for watercooled VW's.  That's right, a news group dedicated to  
aircooled VW's!  If you are interested in supporting this, keep your eyes out  
for the CFV which will be posted to this mailing list as well as rec.autos.vw  
and the VINTAGVW list, and be sure to vote.  Instructions for voting will be  
included in the CFV.

If you have any questions, please send me mail directly at randy_at_id_dot_com
