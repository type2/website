Subject: RE: Head restoration.

The metal sealing rings commonly stick to the inside of the heads - look like 
a thin raised ring around the top of the bore. If so, and you try to unstick 
it be careful not to scratch the head surface.

The thin rubber ring fits in a small groove on the outside of the cylinder. 
After lots of miles this is often full of crud and not visible. Use a small 
pointed scraper and you'll find the groove and can clean it out. The Oring 
will not come out in one piece - it's silicone and very weak - and if the 
engine's ever lost coolant and overheated - may not be much left. Don't use a 
sharp tool when you clean the groove or the scratches may prevent sealing if 
you are re-using the cylinders. Use only the &quot;real&quot; o-rings for this top seal 
- normal non-silicone won't take the heat. (Silicone is good for high temp, 
water and gasses - poor for oil, so it's used only for this top end.)

Now if you can get the piston pins out without the special reamer you are one 
up on me.

Once the coolant is out removing the engine is pretty easy - good time for a 
clutch kit too, and the hoses on an '87 may be questionable.

&gt;I just pulled the heads off of my '87, much to my surprise the upper rubber 
and
&gt;metal sealing rings that my Bentley manual shows were not there!  Is this
&gt;possible?  Do I have the wrong picture of how these go together?  At bottom 
of
&gt;cylinder, there is supposed to be another o-ring.  At the top of the cylinder 
a
&gt;very thin o-ring and a metal sealing gasket.  

&gt;I still have the case in the van, I am wondering if I should take it out and 
see
&gt;what else is 'right'.  Any input appreciated.

&gt;Regards,
