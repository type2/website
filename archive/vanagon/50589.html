I hate that too.  I remember one time I was behind this culo-hole driving   
an 84 brown and tan aircooled.  I waved at him from behind and he, for   
the duration of the trip home, stuck his middle finger at me.  I wanted   
to kick his culo and slap him a few times ( being from the South Bronx,   
slapping another guy is the most disrespectful thing you can do to   
someone), but he looked like a miserable slob.  Maybe his life is taking   
care of him for me.  Upstate NY people!

Ok I have to share one of my experiences...

I have an 84 GL. It is painted (by my own hand ((not finished yet)) and
looks a little tattered). I was in Woodside CA. coming out of a store,   
when
I noticed a woman picking bugs out of her 91 Weekender's Bra. I went over
and made small talk. I said yeah I love my bus too.(I have become used to
saying bus as a means of description, because when I tell people about   
what
takes me on my travels, Vanagon usually gets me a blank stare.) She   
looked
at me like I slapped her and said, &quot;this is a vanagon, not a bus. I don't
drive a bus.&quot; Now my vanagon was parked right next to hers and my door   
was
open as I spoke to her. God, I was boiling, I hate when you reach out to
others to share a common interest and get snubbed like that...
