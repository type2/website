Subject: Re: Still Smell Coolant

Saw your note----&gt;
&gt;
&gt;However, I can still (as in before the overheating) smell coolant in the 
&gt;passenger compartment.
&gt;
&gt;I do not think it comes from the rear heater.  That used to leak but is 
&gt;repaired and shows no signs at all of leakage.
&gt;
I once had a leak in the rear heater of my 86 Vanagon and the coolant worked
its way throughout the entire rear compartment.  I took everything out,
scrubbed the carpet, tried to wash the cork insulation with a light
detergent solution and let dry in the sun but a light coolant odor lingered
every time I ran the rear heater for several years.  I think once it gets
into the cork insulation pads, its almost impossible to remove
completely..but its probably harmless.

I think the simplest check for &quot;hidden&quot; coolant leaks is to fill the
overflow exactly to the full line when the engine is overnight cool.  My
experience is that even minor leaks result in a coolant drop below the full
line within a few days.
