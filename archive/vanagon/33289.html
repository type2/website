&gt; If they discovered a 1000 cubic mile hunk of diamond tomarrow, and it's price
&gt; dropped to that of coal, would it still carry the sentiment value it has
&gt; today? 

There's enuf diamonds in storage to eat them for breakfast.  Its a tightly
controlled market, and only a few are released at any one time to keep
the price high.  If it was any other business, people would scream, 
but oh well.  Women don't last forever, so why bother giving them diamonds?
