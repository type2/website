&gt; Don't even bother trying to get the right hose, even if you fix it it never
&gt; worked right to begin with.

Although I think the electric idea is good, I strongly disagree
with allusions about the pressurized sytem not working.  On my
'76 I rebuilt the entire system using modern silicone tubing
including the tube to the air valve and had excellent results,
the system was good for certainly more than 30 nice squirts enough
for say a 150 mile trip in inclement weather and would hold pressure
for about 2 weeks sitting with no problem,  now the '71 system is
origional and leaks off badly but I will rebuild it stock, still
an electric system would never require you to remember to repressurize
a definite plus, especially on a bad night with no air pump, no
gas stations in sight, and no pressure.
