The last time I was in Japan (about a year ago)  I remember seeing a
light blue 70's type 2.  It was a delivery van type, with sliding 
doors on both sides, and no seats on the inside (except for the front
seats).  It was a right-hand drive.

I also remember that the surfing set (from an earlier stay in Japan about
7 years ago) had plenty of older type 2's.  I don't think I ever saw
a split or a westy.

Whether this is proof that type 2's were imported into Japan (by VW) is
debatable.  At any rate, since insurance, registration and taxes go up
exponentially as the car gets older, there are very few old cars 
of any type anywhere in Japan.
