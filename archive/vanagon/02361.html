&gt; I figger if I can just trap a Vortex and slip in the back of my microbus
&gt; I won't have to worry about paying for gas the whole trip!  Might be good
&gt; for cooking food on camp-outs, and a whole slew of other *power* oriented
&gt; activities!

Well, there's a powered subwoofer for automobiles called the Vortex from
Phoenix Gold... I can try to dig one of those up... they're &gt;$1000 though
and are kinda wasted on the noisy interior of a Bus... although I stuffed
1140 watts of music into a Fox, I might as well do something obnoxious
with the Vanagon.

OBtravel.anecdote: When I visited the folks this weekend I paced an
unmarked police car for 2 hours at 75mph. Looks like I'm not the only 
one that spits on the &quot;Basic Speed Law of the Commonwealth of PA&quot;...

OBproblem.to.be.fixed.today: When I go around curved my oil pressure
indicator lights and buzzes. I must be low on oil...
