Subject: Re: Gauged Animals?


&gt;Go to your local BIG newsstand and
&gt;get a copy of &quot;Trade-a-Plane&quot;, and browse the ads for guages and sensors...
&gt;
&gt;A casual perusal of an old issue in my office reveals: single CHT (Cylinder 

&gt;head temp) guages, single EGT (exhaust gas temperature) guages, combined
&gt;single EGT and CHT, 4 channel EGT, 4 channel CHT, 6 channel sets fro you 
fols
&gt;with porsche conversions, and even guages with computer controlled scanners 

&gt;that scan all the channels, remember high temperatures and sound an alarm 
if
&gt;it goes out of a user-settable range.


Golllllll-ly! The wonders of modern technology.

And I still just watch for smoke out the back.   :^)
