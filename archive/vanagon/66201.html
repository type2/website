Subject:      Eurovan Camper

I live and work in the Persian Gulf.  I plan a vacation next summer in
Europe.  I need leads on renting/buying a Westphalia conversion (maybe
California model) Eurovan Camper (T4?).  How do I make contact
directly with Westphalia in Germany on buying one?  What are the
newsgroups that might cater to my needs?
