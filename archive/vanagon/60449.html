&gt;Couple of silly questions....

... and some silly answers, right back atcha! :)

&gt;Anyone take their westy through a car wash?  Problems?  Plusses (like the roof
&gt; gets washed!!!).

huh. round here, you can't even get a NON-camper through the car-wash. all
they take down here is midget sedans and small pickup trucks. you have to
go to the coin-op-spray-it-yourself-and-get-mud-splattered-all-over-you type
wash stalls.

&gt;Anyone know how to adjust the windshield washer so they don't fill up the roof
&gt; carrier instead of hit the windshield?

get a thin straight pin or safety pin ... stick the pointed end into the
hole in the washer squirter nozzle (on the &quot;hood&quot;). press firmly and move
the other end of the pin. just a very tiny bit of movement makes a BIG
difference in where the squirt lands on the windshield. it'll take you about
five or six tries to get it where you want it. :)
