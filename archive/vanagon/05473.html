Subject:      mufflers

A friend of mine has an 84 GL (water cooled and air conditioned) and 
he was wondering what was the best dollar to mileage value on a 
muffler.

He replaced his about 40k ( highway miles) ago with a $100 muffler 
and he is due for another already.  He seems to think this is too soon 
for it to have to be replaced and I sorta agree with him.

Thanks,
