Subject: even more '54 RHD deluxe progress!

        I was a weldin' fool tonight!

        I got the icky metal in front of the cargo floor, underneath, cut
off, and welded on the front half of the longitudinal.  Then I welded on one
of the rear outriggers and the front outrigger.  I then did test fits of the
chassis center sections, the pieces that go between the longitudinals, which
the heater tube and cables pass thru.

        These center pieces are different between barndoor and non-barndoor
busses, but its very close.  Basically its a matter of opening up one of the
pre-cut holes a bit, and having another hole that nothing goes into.
