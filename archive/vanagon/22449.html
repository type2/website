Subject: IN SEARCH OF.....

Hi,

Well, continuing to search for stuff the the 76' westy.  Here is what I 
am trying to find.  Looking for used on most--Can find the new but 
expensive.  Any leads appreciated.

1.  Decent used curtains or pattern for them(Has anyone made their our  
    curtains that look decent??--Would really like the patterns)

2.  Water pump for sink--This is the outside of the tank type that      
    hooks on the bottom.

3.  Extendable tubes for front hammock.  I have the solid steel bar     
    type and they are not the right size for my year(dimensions upon    
    request)--Also need the canvas.

4.  Plastic Handles with the push buttons for the cabinets              
    inside--prefer black if possible.

5.  Stock working radio--nothing fancy

6.  Attachable Tent--Not one that costs $300--that I can get. I know    
    that no one is going to offer one up but I still gotta ask!!

Thanks for the help.

Joe
