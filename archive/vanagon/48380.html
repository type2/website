I have a canvas tent for a VW from around 1972.  It is in great shape,
 with no rips and all parts available, the bottom has a couple of the
 stake loops off but no rips and the loops are with it to be glued back
 on.  The tent is the orange with a blue top and has a zippered opening
 for connecting to the camper.  Is there any kind of market for people
 interested in it, and what are people willing to pay for this kind of
 thing?
                         Thanks,
                             Skinner
