Subject: Spark Plugs -Tri Electrode / Factory Alloy (just one) wanted

Is there any one out there using Bosch tri - electrode plugs in their
Vanagon and if so what heat range? I hava a set of W7DTC that I am thinking
about installing - they look as if they may have a longer reach than the
stock plugs - any suggestions/comments? Also I am in need of 1 alloy wheel
(you dont want to know the story) is there anyone willing to sell one??
