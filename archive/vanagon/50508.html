Subject: T-Shirts Coming in

Howdy all. I've begun getting the shirts back from the printer. I have most of
the Search and Rescue shirts, and I expect the List shirts in the next day or
so.
They should be going out early next week, so be on the lookout.
Many thanks for everyone's order. I know I'll have some extra rescue shirts,
and some of those split-window bus shirts as well, so e-mail me in a few days
if you're interested.
Thanks!
:)
