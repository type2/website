Subject:       '57 Bumpers Request

Howdy all!

Well, a little update on the Pioneer.

After the shifter coupler came loose from the transmission whilst 
driving the other week, I temporarily repaired it, and got it home.  
The other Saturday I tried to get the coupler off.

Ack!  There is just not quite enough room to get the tranny part back 
enough, and the shift linkage forward enough to slip it off.

Anyhow, I gave up there, and decided to put the bolts back in.  I 
had to take one of the bolts to the grinder wheel to clean up the 
threads on the end.  When I put it back together, I purposely reversed 
the bolts in the opposite holes, and low and behold it tightened up 
properly.

So now there is one more thing to worry about breaking as I drive 
around!  :-)

Well, it has come time to send out a formal request to find a CLEAN 
(no mangled cut up bumpers) set of 50's bumpers for the bus.

ANY contacts would be appreciated.   

Today the letter gets sent off to VWAG requesting information to find 
out of my baby is really a '57 (as the title says) or a '58 as 
the chassis number apparently points out...
