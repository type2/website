&gt;Humvee tires use a pneumatic jacket around a 'fail-safe' core-tire.  The
&gt;jacket may be inflated or deflated while the vehicle is in motion, allowing
&gt;it to adjust its traction to the terrain.  Should the pneumatic jacket be
&gt;damaged, the fail-safe core will usually provide enough support for the
&gt;vehicle to withdraw under its own power.
&gt;
&gt;
If I remember right from the preventive maintenance I had to take to get
licensed for the Humvee the &quot;fail-safe&quot; core-tire is an aluminum &quot;doughnut&quot;.
 If the tire is deflated the vehicle rides on this, just not as fast.
