Subject: '71 Clutch Cable

Hi Volks,

About 5 or 6 months ago I replaced my clutch cable because it had stretched 
beyond adjustment. At the same time I replaced the bowden (sp) tube, got a new 
clip to attach it to the pedal and added a new wing nut.

About 2 months ago the clutch started to feel strange -- kind of 
stretchy/springy and then the clutch began to progressivly drop nearly to the 
floor before releasing and then it finally broke at the pedal end. (This all 
happened while I was running an errand in about 2 hours lapsed time.) The 
cable's forward end  was completely frayed when  I removed it. 

Now the same 'stretchyness' and clutch 'losing adjustment' is beginning to 
happen and I am assuming that a similar thing is going to happen to the cable 
again. The Wayback is parked while I pick up another cable today. Tonight I 
will R&amp;R the cable again. 

My question is: Have I just gotten some bad cables (1st-Bus Stop, 2nd-VW 
FLAPS) or is there something basic that I am missing? The installation 'seems' 
very basic and I've use plenty of moly-lube. 

Thanks--


-Scott
