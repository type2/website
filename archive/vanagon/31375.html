Subject: Emission update 84 Westy

OK Everybody,  I told you about my 84 Westfalia lurching and
hesitating, about 10% of the time when coming off idle, and only with
the O2 sensor hooked up. Recall I couldn't find the problem so I took
it into VW for true German diagnosis.  They fixed everything up for
me and the culprit was engine management settings that were off and a
collapsed crankcase breather hose. 

I PASSED AIRCARE!

Here are the results;

-------------------------------------------------------------
AirCare Inspection Report
1984 VW Westfalia, 205,000 kms.
BEFORE REPAIRS

HC_at_load (ppm) :  Actual:  115  Permitted: 300
HC_at_idle (ppm) :  Actual:  367  Permitted: 350  FAIL

CO_at_load (%) Actual 0.91  Permitted 2.00
CO_at_idle (%) Actual 0.42  Permitted 4.00

NOx_at_load (ppm)  Actual 1450  Permitted 2667
---------------------------------------------------------------
AirCare Inspection Report
1984 Westfalia, 207,500 kms.
AFTER REPAIRS TOTALING $275 Cdn from VW.

HC_at_load (ppm) :  Actual:  83  Permitted: 300
HC_at_idle (ppm) :  Actual:  37  Permitted: 350

CO_at_load (%) Actual 1.00  Permitted 2.00
CO_at_idle (%) Actual 0.46  Permitted 4.00

NOx_at_load (ppm)  Actual 1575  Permitted 2667
----------------------------------------------------------------

You can see the HC emissions went way down with the fix, I guess it 
eliminated the intermitent miss which probably got me before.
