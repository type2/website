Malcolm,

I would not drill holes in my top!

I use Thule racks on my westy.  I forget the model # but they will reach
over the top and still mount on the gutter rails.  I carry 4 bikes and a
canoe with no problems.

&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any words to the wise regarding the idea of putting 
&gt; gutter-mount roof racks (Yakima) on the pop-up top of a Westy, using bolt

&gt; on adaptors? I'm looking at a max load of maybe 100 lbs., and usually 
&gt; much less. My usual load will be windsurfing masts, and I'd rather be 
&gt; able to open the top with them still attached. Comments, anyone?
