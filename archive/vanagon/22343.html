Subject: Vanagon starter switch problems

With the recent threads describing starting problems, I thought I would add
my experiences with my '87 Vanagon Camper. While driving through west Texas
one night with nothing to do but brake occasionally for the jack rabbits that
would sit up in the middle of the road and stare at my vanagon, all of a
sudden, my headlights went out!!
Mind you, I had absolutely no lights from any other source except the stars
and here I am going 65 mph in total darkness...luckily it was a rather
straight stretch...as most roads are in those parts. Frantically, I stopped as
quickly as I could and shut off the engine and hoped that I was dreaming.
As soon as I restarted the engine, the lights came back on and I was not
troubled by that problem again....until some time later during a rain storm,
my windshield wipers stopped working. There was a common thread to these
problems and it turned out to be the starter switch, if it is not making good
contact in the second position, all sorts of problems manifest themselves, ie
no headlights or windshield wipers. Swapped out the switch and have not had
a problem with either since.
