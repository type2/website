&gt;&gt;&gt; I take issue with the following statement from WHellmer_at_aol_dot_com:
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; the change in magnetic strength in your alternator
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; does not dissipate horsepower from the engine or produce 
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; signifigant additional &quot;drag&quot; as some seem to believe. it is 
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; important to understand how a bosch alternator functions in 
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; order to further explain.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; The force on a current carrying wire in a magnetic field is proportional
&gt;&gt;&gt; to both the magnetic field and the current.  I.e. you increase the torque
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the alternator by drawing more current or by increasing the field.
Adding
&gt;&gt;&gt; a load to the alternator increases both.  When the current draw is higher
&gt;&gt;&gt; you need more force to push the wire through the field and this force must
&gt;&gt;&gt; come from the engine, slowing it down.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The enigne spins the alternator or generator whether or not it is 
&gt;&gt;charging the battery.  The engines forces turns the mechanical part, it 
&gt;&gt;doesn't vary based on the electrical characteristics.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 2. how a bosch alternator works:
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; [ generally correct description removed to save space ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; OK, this is almost exactly how the large generators at your neighborhood
&gt;&gt;&gt; nuclear power plant work.  If what you say is true, if we could get that
&gt;&gt;&gt; thing spinning with my 2.0L VW engine, adding the city of Chicago to the 
&gt;&gt;&gt; output wouldn't significantly load down the engine.  I think I better call
&gt;&gt;&gt; the DOE!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Sure you could power the city of Chicago for exactly as long as the 12 
&gt;&gt;volt battery could power the city.  Again the mechanical force needed to 
&gt;&gt;turn the alternator doesn't vary.  But once the battery is discharged the 
&gt;&gt;engine will stop without sparks.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; now back to the point. the mechanical energy consumed by the rotation
of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; alternator does not increase as electrical output increases. your engine
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; cannot tell if the alt is outputting 20 amps or
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 55 amps. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;now for those of you theorists who are waiting to drop the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;increased resistance to rotation as a result of induction&quot; bomb,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; this effect would be similar to lightly rubbing your finger against
the fan
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; pully and would definately not be measured in horsepower;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; inch-ounces perhaps :)
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Lets see:  20A * 12V is 240 Watts which is nearly 1/3 horsepower.  At 60A,
&gt;&gt;&gt; you get nearly one horsepower.  So, neglecting inefficiencies in your
&gt;&gt;&gt; alternator, you would need 2/3 hp from your engine to get 40 more amps for
&gt;&gt;&gt; your stereo.  You do agree that the energy has to come from somewhere,
right?
&gt;&gt;&gt; And, since the alternator isn't all that efficient, it probably is more 
&gt;&gt;&gt; like 1.5 or 2 hp.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Your EM theories are not the problem.  Check the mechanical forces 
&gt;&gt;involved.  The alternator will spin the same rate the engine pushes it 
&gt;&gt;regardless of whether the battery needs charging or the electrical 
&gt;&gt;gadgets are running.  If the mechanical spin force is not converted into 
&gt;&gt;electricity it will dissipate as heat.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Of course I could be wrong also...

Yes, you could.

Try this, I have;  disconnect your fan belt (upright engines), attach a
variable speed drill to your alt/genny thing via a chuck attachment and the
proper socket.  Turn your ignition key on and run the alt/genny with the
drill.  With no electrical load you will feel the thing 'kick in' when the
thing reaches the rpm needed to fire the rotor.  Now start turning things
on, one by one.  Little loads (interior lights, running lights) will hardly
be felt, but when you turn on your headlights, uunnhh, the drill bogs down
significantly, i.e. ~1 hp.  That is in fact, 1 hp the engine is required to
pay to the charging system.  Make no mistake about it, electrical energy is
created with hp.  Electrical energy does not simply _appear_.  I've made
bicycle sleds that drive an alternator with a belt off the rear wheel and
attached bunches of headlights to it.  I think I could push about 4 small
headlights before I just couldn't pump the pedals hard enough, propably over
1/2 hp.  Racing cyclists are known to push 1/4 hp and 1/2 hp in sprints.
The guy who crossed the English Channel on a pedal powered aero produced 1/4
hp the whole way, with a couple peaks when he almost hit the water.
Remember when the Chinese had a law that you couldn't use your headlights at
night in order to save the countries fuel?  They finally allowed headlights
somewhere in the early seventies I think, after a few dead peasants.  Ever
wonder about the lamps inside the headlight fixtures of the splitties?  They
can be used to drive on those nights when you're on a slow road and low on
gas.  Not that anybody would get themselves in that situation, but I'm sure
it is/was common practice in the third world.  Though I'm sure the 1/2 hp
saved was eaten up easily in a few quick blips of the throttle somewhere else.

Who is sure all that water going through Hoover dam is doing _something_.
