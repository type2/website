&gt; &gt; Another idea is to put in an early bus reserve valve (they fit, I've done it)
&gt; &gt; so you can shut the gas off altogether.

&gt; 
&gt;   Are these reserve valves easy to come by? If the valve is mounted on the 
&gt;   tank, all the flexible hose in the whole system could be changed without
&gt;   draining the tank! I like this idea.

They should be.  All the pre-gas guage busses have them.  This thing goes
in where the little fuel tap (that screws onto the bottom of the tank) goes.
