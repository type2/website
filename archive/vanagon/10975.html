&gt; Hey guys,
&gt;    My steering is becoming an obsession! I replaced the drag link this

&gt; removing tie rod ends and stuff. It really works great!  Anybody know
&gt; how to rebuild the steering box?
&gt; 

Its funny, I was going to mail the list to find out if
anyone has information on the acceptable enfloat in the steering
box. 

I've rebuilt my early style box (68-70) twice and have learn't
don't play with the shims unless you know what the clearance should
be! (Hence the above question). Apart from that its very few components
to play with. The peg is surrounded by two sets of
small taper bearings, so if you take that assembly apart it is
a bit fiddly to reassemble, but that aside nothings a real problem.

Actually finding what is wrong with the box when you are in there
isn't so easy if you don't have the original specs to compare against!

There is nothing complicated in the earlier style ones, I've
never stripped the later type, but they don't have the adjustable
`worm and peg' system so I don't know what is in there instead.
