&gt;     It's too late!  I just got off the phone with Johnson's customer 
&gt;     service.  They have had the Eureka AVT in their catalog since
&gt;    1989; until this January.  All the speciality tents have been 
&gt;     discontinued, including the AVT -   poor sales.  They also
&gt;     couldn't hazard a guess as to whether any of their vendors 
&gt;     have any in stock (probably not, was the answer)....
&gt;
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;  BTW, I think she said that the tent sold for about $250!
     
     Blaine, it's been dropped from Campmor's summer '97
 catalog.  The late spring issue listed &quot;very limited quantities! 
 while they last!&quot; for only  $460.00, US, which might explain why it
wasn't such a hot seller.
     
     Campmor's customer service and product information
 line is 1-800-525-4784, hours- 0900-1700 eastern time.
