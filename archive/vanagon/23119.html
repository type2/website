&gt; Subject:        fuel overflow

&gt; Can anyone tell me why when I fill up the fuel tank
&gt; on 87 vanagon there is an overflow and fuel spills 
&gt; under car?  What do I need to do to fix it?
&gt;                                                                             
&gt;                                                                          /\o
&gt; /\    ewn
&gt; 

Try checking the connections at the fuel tank for the overflow 
reservoir, which is mounted under the right front fender.  Use a 
flashlight and peer onto the top of the gas tank.  These thin 
overflow hoses use those $%^#$ crimp-type hose clamps and they were 
leaking on my '87.  They can be changed by working thru the wheel 
well and anticipating a really greasey fore-arm.  Make sure the tank 
is not plumb full when doing this  :)
