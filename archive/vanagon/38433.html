Subject: 65 ex-camper panel van FS (kinda long)

1965 VW Panel Van from Idaho (i.e.quite rust free). Van was coverted by ASI
to a camper years ago.The van has had the cheesy camper interior removed
and is in all senses a panel van except for those infamous aftermarket
camper windows installed. I could kick all the aftermarket companies that
hacked windows (3 on drivers side one in each of the cargo doors)

I would like to get $1000US for the bus or something close to that. Right
now the bus is not running. To get it running would require major engine
work (engine threw a rod) and personally i would redo the brake lines and
wheel cylinder but that would be your choice :)

The bus is a 65' panel in velvet green. the worst areas are there are some
pin holes below the cargo doos (like about 99% odf old busses) and the dent
in the back

Unfrotunately the van has had those infamous aftermarket camper windows
installed. i could kick all the aftermarket companies that hacked windows
(3 on drivers side one in each of the cargo doors) in panel vans but this
was done before i was born so there is not much i can do about it!
hindsight is 20/20 i guess.

Believe it or not there is a vertical dent that runs from just below the
window on the rear hatch to the top of the engine lid. I have a spare rear
hatch that I would be prepared to throw in w/ the deal (rather than having
to fiddle w/ the dented hatch)

I am also pretty sure that i have an undented engine lid that i could throw
in. The worst part about the dent is the small pice of metal below the
cargo door and above the engine door got dented in too and has resulted in
the sheet metal above the engine (right near the &quot;catch&quot; for the rear
hatch) being dented up, this would need to be pulled out, you could likely
do this w/ a winch but i didn't want to monkey w/ it so i have left it be
utnil i had the time.

The van is a bench seat model  (and I will throw in the VW cab divider too :)

There is also was a sparetire holderr on the front of the van that i have
removed but the four holes are still there.

The van is velvet green it also has a small metal &quot;rail&quot; screwed in to the
roof that a tent would have originally attached to. Unfortunately the tent
is long gone, and seeing as how the &quot;rail&quot; is also painted velvet green i
thought it would be better to leave it for the time being.

The van is not &quot;certified&quot; but i do have the ownership. To certify ( i
haven't had it checked out) it would require new brakes lines (don't have
these) and wheel cylinders (do have these and they go w/ the van along w/
misc parts like cylinder heads, radio block off plates, spare uncracked
sterring wheel, spare panel van cargo door) etc... it would also likely
need new front windshields as they are kinda getting fogged.

The engine (SP 1600) threw a rod and that and has been sitting for about 4
years, so it would definately need engine work (haven't torn it apart to
see the damage).

I am willing to dicker on the price as i would like to buy the another van
ASAP :) lemme know if you are still interested

I have the registration for it so i can't see why you would get any hassles
crossing in to the US. i have the old ownership from viriginia and idaho
too if that would help. currently the car is registered under my name in
ontario so i can't see why there would be any hassles's
