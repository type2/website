&gt;I have to correct you about the Weekender package.
&gt;It did come with a refrig and also a table.
&gt;And it didn't have a middle seat but instead 2(maybe 1) jumpseat(s)

folks, the operative word here is &quot;package&quot;. VW used the term &quot;Weekender&quot;
at two different times, once as a &quot;package&quot; which was optional on the GL
models, and then as a &quot;model&quot; ...

the Weekender Package is the fold-down rear bench seat. period. it folds
down into a sleeping area (about queen-size). it came only in the GL models
and (i think) in the Wolfsburg Limited models. after about 1988, it was
pretty much included on most of the buses sold over here (cause they were
almost always GL's).

the Weekender MODEL was a whole bus .... with a pop-up top. almost a camper
but without the camper interior. i think it had SOME of the cabinets but not
the whole camper cabinet setup.

anyway, it's confusing. so you have to specify whether you mean the Option
Package called Weekender, or the special sale model Weekender bus. :)
