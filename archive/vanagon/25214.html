&gt; To Whom It May Concern,
&gt; 
&gt; I request your either your advice on a problem I have with my 
&gt; 1986 Vanagon or can you recommend someone I can ask?
&gt; 
&gt; For the second time since 1990 (first at 37,000 mi. and 
&gt; now at 91,000 mi) my head gaskets leaked coolant.  
&gt; This time the leak is very severe.

I have a question:  Looking at the waterboxer in a junkyard I noticed
how thin a strip of metal there is as a sealing surface for the heads.
It's no wonder these things leak so fast!  so *WHY* don't people o-ring
the cylinders or heads to make them seal better?  It's a common trick
for hotrodders.  If I had a water-cooled that's the first mod I would
make to combat the problem.  For those that don't know, &quot;o-ringing&quot; is a
process where a small groove is cut into the sealing surface and a thin
metal wire ring is installed in it.  The ring mashes into the head gasket
giving a lot more clamping force at that point.  My apologies to the
gearheads on the list for whom that was an inadequate description.  :)
