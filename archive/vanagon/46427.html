        To change the subject a bit, Why don't Vanagon drivers wave?
Whenever I take the '72 camper on a trip, air cooled people wave (and I wave
too).  When I drive my '82 no one seems to wave, why?  I've tried waveing as
I go down I-5, people look at me like im a kook or something (please, don't
say the obvious).

        Well, if you see a beat up '82 w/ a lot of antennas in the Siskiyou
Mts. Wave

        Oh, a couple of reasons air cooled drivers wave 1.  Its anothee one,
and it's running too.  2.  Shared pains and sorrows.
        I have noticed Vanagon drivers will wave in the middle of nowhere
and on dirt roads.
