Subject: RE: Wasserboxer or Aircooled?

No, let's talk about religion: it's less controversial.  Aircooled Vgon
will feel like the handling fairy came and blessed your breadbox.  Also
your engine skills will carry over virtually 100%.  Watercooled Vgon
has the radiator hassles you've been reading about, but is quieter and
perceptibly (not amazingly) more powerful.  Try both before you buy.
