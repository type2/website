&gt; I think the list would appreciate a comprehensive report about the VW
&gt; junkyard in Longview, Washington.  (I know I would!)  I've seen their ads,
&gt; often wondered if they were worth a 1200 mile detour on my way to the store
&gt; some day :-)

Maybe Joel can start a list of good VW junkyards around the country.  We can
tell him about theses places and give them ratings for prices, service, list
member discounts, etc.  How about it?
