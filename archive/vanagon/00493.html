Subject:      Re: Fuel Usage

&gt;&gt;&gt; Isn't it true that it is not good for the car to let the gas get
&gt;&gt;&gt; so low?  You are then &quot;feeding&quot; sludge from the bottom of the tank,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and not good for fuel injectors, etc.?

true. true. true. BUT ... see below. :)

&gt;Besides the fuel line feeding from the BOTTOM of the tank, the fuel
&gt;injection system pumps WAY more fuel than the engine needs, and it is
&gt;returned to the tank.  This effectively filters the contents of the tank
&gt;over and over again!!!  Unless you are running without a filter, or have
&gt;something really dirty (I think you'ed have to dump sand in the tank) I
&gt;don't think the Vanagon's are really prone to problems by running the tank
&gt;dry.
&gt;Not meant to flame, if someone has a viable reason for this old superstition
&gt;I would like to hear.  I just think if you got some bad gas/sludge that it
&gt;would manifest itself fairly soon (like as you pulled out of the station!!)

i've run out a couple of times (surprised, eh? :)... well, it was a long time
ago.)  and it didn't seem to hurt anything. i did NOT try to keep cranking
the engine (cause i knew i was out) ... which is what i think hurts things
(running the pump dry).  the discussion about the filtering of the fuel
is also why i change that big expensive fuel filter more often than vw wants.

just for info: that 250-260 miles takes 13.9 gallons on average ... so i've
still got 2 gallons left in there.
