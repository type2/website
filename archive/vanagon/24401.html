Subject: Re: The '71 single cab that isn't

&gt;
&gt;OK, so I got ahold of the guy and it turns out:
&gt;
&gt;* It's a '70, not a '71.
&gt;* It's got a Corvair engine in it. 
&gt;* &quot;Ran fine 2 years ago when I last ran it&quot;
&gt;* Body is said to be good. 
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Now how much would you pay?&quot;
&gt;
&gt;At this point, I'm thinking. This is actually the second week it's
&gt;been in the paper; he didn't think it would be selling soon. I'll
&gt;prolly take a look and then pass on it (and pass his # on), I dunno.
&gt;Apparently it's got the bus tranny, but with the ring gear flipped to
&gt;make it go backwards for the corvair engine.  Any feedback on how hard
&gt;that would be to undo?
&gt;

Well, if the engine is out of a spyder, ie. the 4 (!) carb model, the engine 
has 140 _stock_ HP.  That is an awfull lot of ponies.  Recently, a guy who 
had a 59 willy's jeep told me that corvair parts are still available.  He 
mentioned that you had to wait for them, but you can still get them.  

Idunno how hard it is to undo the ring gear, it would be easier to just swap 
the tranny's.  While your there, make sure to add a front beam of a 73' and 
later to stop all of those ponies. :-).  Sure a 71 beam would do, as well, 
but the 73's have bigger calipers.

If I was in cali, I would be all over it.
