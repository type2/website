Subject: 12 year model cycle

Hello, all you VW nuts.

I'm new to this list, and have been amused by all this talk about air
conditioning and refrigerators... Spare me!  :)  I have a 76 Westfalia (now
in TN) which I drove around Texas for nigh ten years (even to big Bend Nat'l
Park, where I did a lot of impromptu repairs) with no AC or fridge.  No
problem.  

Anyway, I noticed something else that you folks probably already know, since
it seemed so obvious.  In the list of models, each was produced for 12
years, it seems.  Is this a coincidence, or is it part of a Master VW Plan
that just when they get the bugs (no pun intended) worked out they
completely redesign the vehicle?  Do we anticipate that 2003 will be the
last year ofthe Eurovan?
