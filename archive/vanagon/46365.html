&gt; We've decided to put the Air-Cooled Vanagons (80-83 or so) on the Air-Cooled
&gt; list.  Feel free to subscribe to the other too.

I dunno: it made sense to me to make the break at the last of the
breadloafs.  Vanagons seem to have more in common with each other
than w/splits &amp; loafs...

My idea for my OWN list (someday) was to go '50 to '67, but I need to
do some more work before I can put my money where my mouth is...
(when we get the T3 put in...)

I wholeheartedly support the split (delicious pun intended).  

The only way I keep up with this list and vintagvw is heavy filtering.  
My rules file is about 160 lines long...
