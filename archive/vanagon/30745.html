To all,

The German company B.A.S. has a new address, i hope none
of you have used the address i gave in a earlier post.
I'm going to B.A.S. coming Saturday to have some machine
work done and for parts. 
So i called and heard that they were moved, the phonenumbers
are still the same but the address changed to:

 Berndt Ahnendorp Sport
 Industriestrasse 2
 D-46419 Isselburg
 Germany

I'm going to bring a catalog with me for a fellow listmember,
let me know if i need to bring more, they are approx. 10 to 15
German Marks.

Brian.
