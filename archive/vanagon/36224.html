In response to:

&quot;However, should the general feeling be that such trip reports as I've
submitted in the past are of no interest, I'll abide by the wishes of
electronic community of which I'm privileged to be a part and pull the plug
on the word processor&quot;

I for one really enjoy your contribtuions of this nature.  &quot;Ya nevver know&quot;
when you might glean a critrical bit of info from such an account.  In
addition, I enjoy your writing style and look forward to such posts for the
&quot;change of pace&quot; that they inject in my day.  (Not that I wish you hardships
and troubles, quite the contrary,- but it is enlightening and rewarding to be
able to know someone who sees things through, too many people don't these
days!)

So I would encourage you sharing with the rest of us to the extent that you
are comfortable!
Thanks 
Harvey
