Subject: F.S. 87' Syncro

Hi Everyone,

Well, my wife and I just put a deposit on a house and I,m going to have to
sell my syncro. If you remember, I was going to sell it last year but just
could'nt do it.  The van is in good shape with no leaks, passed emissions and
runs well. I have maintained this thing diligently for the past 3 years, ie.
oil changes every 3000 miles, changed the transmission fluid and coolant
every year, and just had the transmission mounts redone etc. etc.  The van is
located in the Hartford, Connecticut area .Here are the stats....

Current millage 84k
Color titian red with tan interior.  interior is in excellant shape with no
rips or stains.
front brake rotars and pads redone last year, rear shoes replaced this year.
Heads and gaskets replaced at approximatley 55k, no leaks
Engine passed emissions with no problems.
new cat and muffler
some small dings on exterior but overall the outside is in good condition
new window rubber on front and rear windows.

The only thing that currently doesn't work is the rear diff lock.

Price $4,700 negotiable

anyone interested can E-mail me _at_ plickys_at_aol_dot_com or call me _at_ (203) 871-1516
after 6:00 weekdays or anytime during the weekends.  

Mike
