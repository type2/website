&gt; All this talk about starting from engine bay reminds me something I
&gt; had in mind for a long time:
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a contact anywhere in the gearbox that one could use to tell
&gt; the vehicle is in gear or not?  A lot of newer cars have the switch at
&gt; the clucth pedal to make sure the vehicle does not start &amp; go when you
&gt; crank the starter.
&gt; 
&gt; The kind of unfortunate incident this could be used to prevent has
&gt; happened to yours truly a few times :-(
