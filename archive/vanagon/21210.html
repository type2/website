Subject: Re:Brake fading

John says:
/&gt; One other thing - while test driving and test braking I noticed that a
/&gt; rapid series of hard pumps on the brakes seems to disable the front disks.
/&gt; Hard stabs at the pedal about a second apart gives seriously degraded
/&gt; stopping on the third shot.  Lots more pedal pressure required as well.  Is
/&gt; this fade? (shouldn't have had time to get hot, and if I ran for a few more
/&gt; seconds and then hit the brakes once hard, the front brakes work fine)
/&gt; What could be making the front brakes quit working?

/Sounds like your brake booster is leaking vacuum upon application.

/boosters-- watch for it.

Its not leaking vaccum, it just isnt able to replenish it fast enough
to keep pulling. It takes a second for the engine to drag the vaccum
into the loooong hose from engine to booster. Youre just bleeding it off
faster than it can replenish it. You may have some of the hose partially
collapsed along the way. Visual inspection with the engine running
will tell you if it kinks.

(Not good, but it will keep you from locking you brakes if you
pump them in an emergency situation)
