Ken, I went to take a look at the design. Way Cool!
I have been off the list lately due to an illness and a death in my
family and just today returned. Have the shirts been ordered allready?
Is it too late to get on the list? If not, how do I get on it and how
much do I need to send to where?

TIA,
