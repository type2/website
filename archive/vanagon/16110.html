Subject: Re: Waxoyl

&gt;have heard good things about crown, but haven't actually used the stuff
&gt;myself. i am not sure if crown is available in usa as well. btw anybody
&gt;have any thoughts on waxoyl 

My parents waxoyl'd an '81 Peugeot in '82. The car was new enough to obtain 
a warranty for no rust-out, but the dealer screwed up the paperwork. It 
disintegrated at basically the same rate as any other Peugeot we had before, 
ie damned fast. Peugeots are notorious rust buckets. So, I won't touch it 
IMHO!!.          Won't touch Zeibart either. Zeibart is offering 50% off all 
services for last several months, I'd say they're on the way out. Their 
unofficial motto is: &quot;We coat it, you float it&quot;. Locks in water like nothing 
else, plugs drain holes, then delaminates from your panels and allows water 
to gather between it and them.  tim s. 

ps: can I be sued for this slander??
