Subject: SF Bay Area mechanic? '71

San Francisco Bay Area folks:

Can someone in the Bay Area recommend a good mechanic for my '71? I'm facing
front-end work plus a couple other things that my regular guy doesn't touch.

SF, Oakland, Berkeley are best, but I'm willing to go elsewhere for someone
reliable and reasonable, if that's not an oxymoronic combination these days.
Guaranteed work preferred.

Thanks,

steve tokar
