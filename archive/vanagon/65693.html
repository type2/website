&gt; Anyone know of a source of black plastic VW-insignia caps that will
&gt; cover just the hub on my 14&quot; Syncro wheels?  I don't have alloys and I
&gt; don't have full covers -- just the plain old steel OEM wheels, but I'd
&gt; like to cover the hubs.

West Coast Metric (http://westcoastmetric_dot_com) seems to offer the black
caps you are looking for... just recieved thier catalog a few days ago.
