&gt;what i dislike most about the later buses is the carpeted floor. i realize
&gt;that this helps muffle road noises, but i really miss the rubber mats that
&gt;my 80 bus had.

If anybody is interested, those vinyl/clear plastic mats that go on office
floors so you can roll a chair around are almost a perfect fit over the
carpet in a vanagon. You only have to trim a couple inches off the neck
section. Save the carpet and cleans very simply.
