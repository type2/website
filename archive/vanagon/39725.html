&gt;This is your chance to sound off...

&gt;what VW needs to
&gt;improve its image and hopfully propel it back into the statis it had years
&gt;ago.

Tell 'em they can have the dealerships improve their attitude toward the
owners of aircooleds. I don't mean mere condescension here. I mean open,
sneering contempt. (I'd be happy to pass along the name of the dealership.
&gt;From what I hear my dealership is not unique.)

Knowing, as an irrefutable, indisputable fact, that VW has no use at all
for the owners of cars whose warranties have expired, I would have to be
insane to go out and spend $20-30-40K on a new VW.

Also, the Euro/Winnebago fiasco reported here recenty made a big impression
on at least one reader. Tell them 500 VW devotees here read all about that.
Should have replaced the damn linoleum. Indefensible.
