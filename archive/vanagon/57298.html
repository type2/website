Subject: Bleeding the lifters

I am about to replace the lifters in my '84 (gasoline engine) and was 
wondering about the procedure for bleeding the lifters.  Bently has you 
take apart the lifter, fill it with oil, then re-assemble it using a 
sawed off pushrod as a tool.  Since the only pushrods that I have need to 
go back in the engine, I was wondering if there was another way.  I 
suppose I could follow the Bently procedure, except use a wooden dowel 
instead of the pushrod, so I don't damage the lifter.  How do people 
usually do this?  Anyone have a dead pushrod they could spare?

Bill
