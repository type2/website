Subject: RE: 87 SYNCRO VAN TRANSMISSION BAD?



I have an 87 syncro van with approx 125kmi on it.  Initiallly, when I
shifted from 3rd to 4th it would pop out of gear once, i would shift it back 

in gear and continue on.  This condition degraded.  It will not stay in 4th
for any period of time.  I need to keep slight pressure on the shift column. 



Ah yes (best WC Fields imitation)... another Bungee Bus in the making!  :^)
