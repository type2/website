&gt; &gt;I would like to be counted as someone else who suspects that

&gt; &gt;feeling righteous while vandalizing someone's car made me
&gt; &gt;very uncomfortable.
&gt; 
&gt;      Well put -  Although I suspect the narrator meant no &quot;harm&quot;...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The subtext of the story seemed to me to be one of &quot;getting
&gt; &gt;even with a black person with a bad attitude&quot;. That, to me,
&gt; &gt;is a racial issue.

While I won't defend the vandalization either, I wonder if you all would 
feel more comfortable if the black man in a caddy was replaced with a 
yuppie in a beemer or a bubba in a big ol 4x4? Would anyone rise to the 
defense of these much-maligned groups? 
But we're getting away from the point of this list, and the story, the 
narrator was reacting to someone dissing his VW because of what it was 
and I think we can all identify w/that.
nuff' said?
