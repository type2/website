Hi: 
There are studs avalible that are stepped. One end is 8mm then at about the
middle it steps up to a larger size. You have to drill and tap(you might not
have to drill. the stripped out hole might allready be the proper tap size.
it has been a long time since i had to use one. ) out to the larger size and
screw the stud in. You are left with the stock size stud sticking out.
