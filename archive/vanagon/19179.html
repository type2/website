To All:

J.C.Whitney offers a pair of 'hose pinchers' for clamping fuel and vacuum
lines, six bucks (p/n 38 -- 2717-T).  Most mechanics use a small pair of vise
grips with the jaws set to about 5mm.  Of course, if you're clamping the
typical 30 year old VW bus fuel line, it will break like a stick. (My post on
VW engine fires may be of interest if you drive an older VW.)   

I've got a few sharpened dowels in my kit, use them as plugs.  I also have
some 'T' and 'L' sections of plugged brass tubing for the same purpose, plus
some neoprene hose &amp; plugs for tubing; you can't clamp steel tubing.

If you earn your living working on vehicles you simply can't afford to have
any gasoline around while you work.  The new formulated gas is toxic as hell
and any gasoline can give you a nice chemical burn; fire doesn't even enter
into it.  Gas under the vehicle?  Move the vehicle.  Dry up the gas.  Deal
with the drip.  In forty years I've had the misfortune to see two Crispy
Critters under the remains of vehicles.

A shut-off valve is a standard feature on a properly designed fuel system,
required by law in some areas.  Installing one on a vehicle that doesn't have
one is less of a chore than you may think.  The best shut-off valves are the
ones used in light aircraft.  They often incorporate a filter element and
usually cost like the dickens.  Regular brass fittings will work if they are
designed for gasoline.  Most use O-rings; be sure replacements are available.
 (They usually are; O-rings are pretty much standardized).  Motorcycle fuel
shut-offs work fine, if the valve is from a large bike.  These can often be
had for a song at motorcycle wrecking yards and aren't all that expensive
new.  All of the motorcycle shut-offs I've seen use O-rings and the parts are
widely available. 

If you have a fuel tank that uses brazed-in-place tubing for the outlet/vent
instead of threaded fittings, you can always adapt the tubing to accept an
SAE flared fitting, install a steel flex hose, and mount the fuel shut-off in
some convenient location.  If the tank is more than ten years old it may be
wise to remove it, get rid of the internal rust, and slosh it with sealant.
 Installing a fuel shut off can be part of the overhaul, which may as well
include modifying the tank to accept threaded fittings.  (See an older VW
fuel tank; make it look like that.)  But never play with a fuel tank unless
you understand the hazards; gasoline vapor has about the same explosive
energy as dynamite; that loud noise may be the last thing you ever hear.

If your bus is old enough to vote (mine's almost old enough to be President)
consider replacing your steel fuel lines with stainless steel as part of your
next overhaul.  In the engine compartment stainless steel/Teflon flex hoses
with AN fittings are worth considering; they seem to last forever.  And never
put a clamp-on or push-on fuel filter in the engine compartment.  VW puts the
filter in or under the fuel tank, another in or before the fuel pump.  Never
put one between the pump and the carb.  (I know, everyone does it.  That
doesn't make it right.  See my post on rusty fuel tanks [which is why they
need such filters].  Learn to deal with the problem, not the symptom.)
