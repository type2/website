Subject: VW Euro, Baarlo, the Netherlands.

To all,

Yesterday i've been to VW Euro in Baarlo.
One of the bigger European events, three days of VW fun !
Swapmeet, concours d'elegance, dragrace (lots of Germans!),
and all that.

Saw the Karman Konnection from the UK, got myself a nice
catalog from them ;) , they had nice gennie Empi stuff too.

I saw only one barndoor, strange enough there are not many
people that see how rare such a vehicle is, it didn't get
the attention it deserved i think.

Some other thing i saw was a '79 CA import Bug convertible
NEW! 281 miles, i've heard about those stored-for-years-new-bugs,
but i'd never seen one in person, it was for sale, 40.000 DM.

Also, there was this one of a kind armed '73 transporter,
no sliding door, only a tiny entrancedoor in the side to get into
the cargo area. The first time i saw a baywindow with one piece
windows of one inch thick :) , the windshield was also bulletproof.
&gt;From what i heard, this car is for sale for about a year now, it
belonged to &quot;de Efteling&quot;, a Dutch amusement park.(still for sale)

A '86 CrewCab with VR6...

Late 70's IMMACULATE westy, CA import, brown/beige, tinted glass,
REAL good-looking...

SP-2, Brasilia, T34, all there :)

Brian.
