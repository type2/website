Sorry, I mismatched something, once again:

There is a lot of interest in information about the crash tests. The
test about Vanagon I stored at home and I can forward it easily. But I
have some problem to scan them. Is someone able to translate from
German to English? I would send a FAX copy (3 pages).

The tests about the Eurovan I saw in a magazine my father had. I phoned
him and he said that he dumped the old issues :-( I try to get a reprint
from the local VW dealer.

Ron (coyote=40chaco_dot_com) like to host the tests in his WWW VW pages. It
will be nice to forward all the information about the crash tests we
gather.
