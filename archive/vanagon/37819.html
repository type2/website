Actually, my installer claims that the best place to install speakers is in
the kick panels, down in the bottom outside corners.  This comes closest to
equalizing the speaker-&gt;listener distance.

&gt;One further question:  what kind of aftermarket sound systems have list 
&gt;members installed in the v-gon?  I was thinking 5.25 mid/tweeter separates 
&gt;in the doors, a 3 way amp driving them and an 8&quot; woofer in the board under 
&gt;the rear bench.  Then at a later date, adding another 2 way amp driving 
&gt;6x9's in the airconditioning unit where the rear 4&quot; speakers are.

Great topic for discussion, since I'm slowly upgrading the sound in my van.
I got a PPI 4x25 amp installed recently, as well as a Sony CDX600 head unit.
The speakers that I want are the next (and very expensive) step, one I
probably won't make this year, with Inuvik on the horizon.

Can you fit 6x9 speakers in the air conditioning unit?

One problem I keep trying to figure out is how to install speakers so that
the sound is great from both the driving and the sleeping positions.  I
think it's near impossible without a HUGE budget.
