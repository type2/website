Subject: Re: mpg on 87 syncro

Since the original discussion was in US gallons, I took the liberty of 
converting so that it's clear what's going on here.
1 U.S. Gallon=1.20095 Imperial Gallons
Conversion factor    1/1.20095=0.832674
miles per Imp Gal * 0.832674 = Miles per U.S. gallon.

&gt; Hi there.  Mileage on my '90 Syncro Westy is fairly consistent at 
&gt; 23-24 mpg (imperial).  We don't use the van in town, so my mileage 
19.15 - 19.98 mpg (U.S.)

&gt; installed (VW recall campagn in Canada), and on a recent trip of 
&gt; nearly 2000 km (1200 miles) I averaged 24.7 mpg with a high of 26 and 
   average 20.57  high 21.65 low 19.15
&gt; a low of 23.  That is going over 6 mountain passes, and with a/c on.
