&gt;Once again, Joel Walker comes through with the winning solution:
&gt;Vanagon rear hatch shocks at $29/each + tax, UPS, etc. from
&gt;
&gt;Marin Motor Sports
&gt;63 Industrial Way
&gt;GreenBrae, CA 94904
&gt;(415) 927-7090
&gt;(No URL yet, but claimed they're working on it)
&gt;
&gt;They were in stock, and will arrive tomorrow, and I'll have them
&gt;installed for our ca_dot_campout this weekend.  Whoopee! Thanks to everyone
&gt;who gave me such timely feedback on this.


Uh... you're gonna hate me for this...

Just looked in my latest J.C. WhipMe catalog.  $19.99 each, plus shipping.
Shipping is around $8 - $10, depending on where you are. But they won't
arrive tomorrow. More like two or three weeks in my experience.

They have a super-rush service now, ship same day, gets to you next day,
so the blurb in the catalog says. Never tried it myself. But it costs.

Well, somewhat cheaper, but how long do you want to wait?
