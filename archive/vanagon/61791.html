Subject: re: Michelin MXT? 

I just got a set of these 2 weeks ago.  I had made the mistake of
buying 80K mile Winston Signatures. I couldn't wait for them to wear
out (They obliged by doing so in about 40K miles).  They were
squirrely on grooved pavement and extremely sensitive to crosswinds.
I blame Winston for not warning me that these were not suitable for
the Vanagon.  The difference is amazing, it's like being on rails,
also very quiet.  I think the van is a little quicker on take-off,
less flex in the sidewalls.  I was told by Discount Tire that these
tires are made by Michelin specifically for the Vanagon, no other
applications are listed....I believe it!
