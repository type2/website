Subject: Something Positive

The comments on reliability being a function of maintenance
and interchangeability go a long way to define the old buses
still around.  Sure, there are some lemons, some lousy POs,
and some just bad karma.

The observation that people see a lot of old VWs (bugs and
buses) along the side of the road is more a comment on the
fact that people recognize a bug or a bus.  Has anyone heard
the observation that they see a lot of old Ch*vy Novas on
the side of the road?  Few could identify a dead &quot;Big Three&quot;
car as they drove along; fewer still would even *think* of
trying to identify the rusty hulk by name.

I finished my analysis (obvious plug for NEATO) of the Old
Bus Register last week and know of 144 split window buses
which have been driven for a total of 16 million miles.
These are vehicles which are, at the youngest, 29 years old.

Maybe there is an inordinate number of air-cooled VWs
stranded along the interstate highway system with a thrown
rod or whatever.  The beauty of the heart of this beast is
that with a few tools, two jack stands, a floor jack and a
little knowledge, a replacement engine can go in at the side
of the road.  Try that with a Ch*vy/F*rd/D*dge/T*yota.

No, most of us will not pack a spare engine for a trip and I
would not advise an engine swap next to traffic going 70MPH.
The point is it CAN be done by one person with a few tools.

Think of it as a PC with a mother board as easily replaced
as a video card.  Now, if VW made PCs...would there be as
many junked 286s?  Or would you just pull the board with a
few wires to disconnect and a couple screws and upgrade to a
386, 486 or whatever?

Or, as the old Uncola commercial posited, try getting THAT
from a cola nut!
