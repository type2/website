Subject: VW Books on the internet.

Was cruizin around (WWW style, not California style), and
came across the following URL:
http://www.amazon_dot_com/exec/obidos/Subject=Volkswagen%20automobile/2488-6608595
-652899

It searches for books on VWs. A few people were asking, and these 
guys seem to have the popular ones, and good prices.

(BTW, I DONT work for them, all you pessimistic people...)
