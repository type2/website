Subject: Re: gas heater vs. H2O heater


w
&gt; I currently own an '85 westy that I drive year-round up here in Edmonton
(-35 C yesterday) and before that I had a '77, both equipped with gas
heater, but the '85 of course has the H2O heat also. The gas heater
alone on the '77 was no match for the cold (especially on the hiway with
wind-chill _at_ 60 mph) if the temp dropped below 0 F(-17 C) .. otherwise it
could really belt out the heat, but since it recirculated interior air it
fogged the windows right now. The colder the weather, the more gasoline it
consumed, so I was left with some pretty pathetic mpg numbers when the
mercury dropped. The VW is a pretty cavernous space to heat with that one
heater. My current '85 has both a front and rear H2O heater also, but I
still occassionally use the gas for a quick warmup on really cold days.
The rear H2O heater is very good, and probably throws as many BTU's as
the gasser (with a more powerful fan), but the front one uses fresh air
right off the street, so on really cold, dark days it is tepid at best. I
could probably cure that by throwing a cardboard in front (but that's so
hideous so I use the gasser for aux heat instead).

&gt; &lt;&lt; I just can't wait until I get the '81 sunroof with a/c and gas heater
&gt;  running before I ask this question :-)
&gt;  
&gt;  Any opinions on the gas heater versus the stock heat on a wasserboxer?
&gt;  
&gt;  Any advice/suggestions on using the gas heater?
&gt;  
&gt;  I won't be able to keep both the '81 and the '83 wasserboxer (no room at
&gt;  the inn, and the stable is already too crowded with guys in robes and
&gt;  such), so I'm curious of any opinions. BTW, there will be a seperate post
&gt;  concerning the mechanical aspects of the '81 vs. the '83.5. &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; When working properly, the gas heaters are awsome.  The aircooled vanagon
&gt; will have less power, poorer fuel economy and worse reliability than the
&gt; waterboxer.  Do not plan on using the AC for any lenght of time on long trips
&gt; or at high speeds.  Heasd melt to easy and blocks like to warp.  Unless you
&gt; feel you really need the sunroof, keep the 83.  Maybe you should look for a
&gt; waterboxer with sunroof.  I had an 84 and I loved it.
