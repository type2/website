&gt;Wrote:
&gt;The oil light flickered on. It never came fully on, just flickered on
&gt;and off.
 I have had the same thing occur on my '77 westy, the oil light
flickers a little after driving fast ( a relative term in a bus) then
coming to a stop and idle at a light etc. The owners manual for the
type II says that this is normal and not a cause for concern. So I am
not concerned, lord knows I can find plenty of other bus related
worries to hold my attention.
Peace,
