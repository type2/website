Subject: Chill!/re: Map

Did I miss something here or what? It appears someone likes what amounts to
unsolicited junkmail.  Fairly obvious that it choked a few mailboxes too. I
think more than a few people were peeved by the map/mime message, I just
happened to be the first to put out a note. I've also has positive comment
back on my admonishment. This is my last response, don't call me and I won't
call you. Enough wasted bandwidth already.

Message in this PM.......

&gt;Just listen to yourself.  Don't you think there are bigger things in life to
&gt;worry about?  Seriously, think about it....
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;NEVER EVER SEND SOMETHING LIKE THIS AGAIN!!!!
&gt;
&gt;ASK WHO WANTS IT FIRST!!!!
&gt;THEN DO A SELECTIVE MAILING.
