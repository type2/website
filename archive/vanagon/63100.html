Subject:      &lt;FS&gt;  '86 Syncro Westy

Hi All,

For someone on the east coast maybe a deal, usual disclaimers apply, and I
haven't test driven the thing (yet ;&gt;)

1986 Syncro Westy
164K kms ~ 100K miles
Brown metallic, repainted, needs seams/window sill cleaning up from rust
interior brown/beige, in very good shape
both bumpers chrome/straight

engine??  judging by crust free heads, shiney pushrod tubes etc, I'd say
it's been redone in last 3~4 years. Dealer says 'dunno'

trans/4WD??  I haven't driven it.  Has the rear diff lock.

tires... junk them, 4ply Daytons
brakes???

wierdness...  engine/trans skidplate missing completely (EricO. has one though!)

will need muffler now/soon.


traded for a used Windstar minivan at at the nearby VW dealer
(kind of like taking your faithful dog to the vet for the last time,
 and buying a cat on the way out)

Trans Canada Autohaus (cute non?)

try 1-800-661-9426
or 506-459-1115
or 506-459-1432 (fax)

ask for Dwight, and treat him with the repsect you know he's earned and
deserves, he drives a Toyota pickup.

$11,995Cdn, about &lt;$9K USA,  dicker hard, these things don't sell well here,
if you want 4x4 you by a Ford etc. Reminder, I'm an hour past the US/Canada
border at Maine.
