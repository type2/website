I was searching the lenti ftp site, where the vanagon list is archived
on a monthly basis in compressed files.  I've heard people talk about
&quot;searching the archives&quot;, which you can't really do when the files are
compressed.  So where is the searchable archive?

Also, are the digests archived anywhere?  I run in digest mode, and
occaisionally my system misses one or two.  I'd like to be able to ftp
somewhere and pick up the one I missed, but the month-long archives
are HUGE, and then I have to try to figure which exact messages I
missed.

Thanks,
Rodney
