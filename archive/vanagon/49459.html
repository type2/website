Subject: RE: Syncro driveshaft removal/Vibration

   . All of a sudden I've been getting a intermittent vibe. from the
&gt;drivetrain. It occcurs at random right around 45 MPH.     Any clues
&gt;would be greatly appreciated.

&gt;The problem I had with my driveshaft is that the bushings were shot inside
the shaft. Not much you can do about it. VW says to get a new shaft(of
course they say to get a new shaft even if your joints are bad). I did
rebuild mine but did mess it up during reasembly (don't ask) so it is still
pretty much junk.
