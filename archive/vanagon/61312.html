Subject: Fire Sale: '87 Vanagon parts
Date: Thu, 12 Jun 1997 13:36:01 -0400

Folks, 

Well, no fire was actually involved, but I am highly motivated because I
am moving. (Not far, just around the corner, but the new digs has a real
two car garage, plus  a much longer driveway and more than one bathroom
to better accomodate the annual Mid-Atlantic Type II Holiday Fest.)

Anyway, I don't want to transport all the big, bulky '87 Vanagon items
in the basement: the grey seats (actually, the entire interior), the
front passenger and sliding doors (both in great shape, white), the
complete air-conditioning system, etc. Sorry, no Syncro specific items,
I am hoarding them.

Cash and carry is my plan, make an offer, these things have to go!

Tom F.
