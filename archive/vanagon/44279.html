Subject: Dilemma solved...

after careful consideration ( and the death of several zillion 
hornetsand wasps during the inspection and evaluation) The westy is up 
for sale... as a package( it is restorable, but not by me...)you'ld get 
a better deal...otherwise e-mail your needs...

	the pasts I don't sell to you folks in the next week or so will 
probably be going to the Litchfield Bug-Inn in CT, then NHVW Show and 
swap on the 29th &amp; 30th of June at the Hopkinton Fairgrounds (shameless 
plug for our show... &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;)

		roofracks: Bus and Wood-slat Bug are already spoken 
for...child cot is gone( my partner is keeping that...) very nice SO-42 
interior is still available...

		Thanks for the advice people...

	ps:Keeping the wife too... she comes in handy at Ben &amp; Jerry's 
under Longest owned Category...   ];-&gt;
