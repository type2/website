Of course the end
&gt; result of all this is that I scored a Muir book and am considering a
&gt; Bentley book as well for as many maintenance/repairs as I can do
&gt; myself.  I got the Muir book on-line from Amazon_dot_com:
&gt; http://Amazon_dot_com
&gt; I'll most likely score the Bentley there too.  They have a truly
&gt; amazing amount of books available.

Well I took a look and:
&quot;Volkswagon Bus Camper Van 1979-89&quot; by R.M. Bentley was published in _1911_ and 
sells for $16.95.

My first question would be if anyone knows if Amazon is carrying the service 
manuals for the 2045-2069 Volkswagon VTAL Orbitors yet.

But this can't be the Bentley service manual can it?  It's way too cheap.

Have you already figured this out Brendon?
