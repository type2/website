Robert,

&gt;conjecturing that the loss of .5 L of d  coolant in the past
&gt;1000 miles is due to a leaking gasket in the head.  When do
&gt;I have to go into rebuild mode?  ...

      Check your cooling system first, such as radiator,
      hoses, water pump, refil/overflow tanks, front/rear
      heaters. (For your 84's, I recommend you to replace its
      water pump, and all hoses. I did all of them myself.)
      If you still cannot find any leakage, then it may have 
      problem with the head gaskets (a $800+ job).

      James
