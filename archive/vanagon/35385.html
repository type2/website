Subject: Re: VW parts on CD-ROM

&gt;        Hey, if we can get our hands on one we can set it up somewhere and
&gt;maybe download just what we need. Maybe we could get together a pool if VW
&gt;wanted to charge big bucks. Don't want to infringe, but Coyote Ron recently
&gt;posted that he had no space problems at Chaco. Whadda y'all think? I'd sure
&gt;love to see these goodies...
&gt;
&gt;Peace,
