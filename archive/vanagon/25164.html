&gt;You can view the path of the wires by looking under the dash and by 
&gt;taking the glove box out.  If you take the glove box out, I THINK you 
&gt;can see the one for the defrost.  
&gt;&gt; This at least should be easy.  All the cables can be traced
&gt;&gt; without too much trouble after you remove the plastic heater
&gt;&gt; core cover, 


You may want to take a closer look at Bentley - it indicates, (and  I was able
to confirm)  that the ends of the cables are color coded with colored bands so
all you really need to know is the ends of the cables.  This should enable you
to work only at the end where the cablel terminates in the footwell at the
various flap bell cranks, and at the control lever ends up on the dash.  The
entire assembly of control levers is supposted to be removable as a unit from
the dash with the cables attached.  Bently has a good photo showing which
lever/cable controls which bell crank.
