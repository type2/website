&gt;Anyone know of a good way to effect repairs on a hinge whose mounting holes
&gt;have stripped out?  (the ones in the body, not the door)
&gt;
&gt;I don't see any way to access what appears to be a threaded 'plate' in the
&gt;body above the door hinge, that the hinge screws thread into.  Someone said
&gt;I'll have to weld the hinge to the body, but would rather not get so drastic.

You have 2 choices that I am aware of:

A) Cut a small hole in the hinge carrier behind the offending bold, and 
use the standard bolt-washer-nut setup....

B) Replace the hinge carrier.

I am going to do B because someone prior dir A, and i'm kinda anal about
this bus.  Its slowing turning into a no-holds-barred restoration....
