So Scott.Marks_at_gsa_dot_gov says:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm planning on driving my '65 Camper from Dallas, Texas up 
&gt; to Michigan for Christmas and I would like to make it with 
&gt; the bus and I in one piece.  Anybody have any suggestions 
&gt; about stuff I should check out before the trip? I am mildly 
&gt; mechanical but am not opposed to getting it checked out 
&gt; professionally.
&gt; 
&gt; Any Ideas???
&gt; 

MMMMmmmmm.... I can think of a few..... ;)  

This is my list of essentials for air-cooled VW traveling:
It may seem like you'd need a trailer to haul all this stuff
but it really isn't that much stuff.  

Jumper Cables - Don't leave home without em'.
Sockett Set  - Misc. bolt tightening.
Wrench set  - Misc. bolt tightening.
pliers and crecent wrench  -  Various tighting/bending jobs.
Screwdrivers -  flat &amp; phillips &amp; allen - tighting misc. screws.
Duct Tape -  Holds things together.  Patch hoses.  Keep people quite.
electrical tape - Ad hoc wire fixing.
wheel bearing grease - Various wheel maintenance
brake fluid  - Low brake fluid.  Spongy brake pedal.
matches/lighter - If its cold and you need a light.
   (This assumes you will be away from the car)
toilet paper - Need you ask?
12V test light. - To test out electrical problems.
Volt/ohmmeter. - Better electrical problem tester.
spare auto wire - For testing or replacement.
Wire cutters/strippers for wire.
Rope  -  Emergency pulling, holding up things etc.
walking shoes  -  It could be a long walk.
hat - Keeps the rain or sun off when your walking.
Jacket  -  It gets cold sometimes.
Spare parts:

  Plugs, points, condensor, cap, throttle cable, clutch cable
  wiper blades, fuel injection parts (injectors, gas line, 
  sensors; especially for older vehicles).

  Bring along any spare part that you think might be getting to
  the end of it's life.  This could be a starter, alternator or
  a fuel pump etc.  If you're short on dough, then get a used
  working part and limp it till you can replace it.  I'd never
  go out on the road with questionable brakes or wheel bearings.
  It just isn't safe.  Make your Momma and Pappa proud and get 
  those brakes and bearings fixed so they won't worry about you.

Spare belts  -  You won't have to wait for the garage to order them.
                (sometimes it takes days)
Good Spare tire (fully inflated)  -  Nothin' like a useless spare to ruin
				     your day
Make sure your jack works.  Grease it.  -  Changing a tire is hard enough
                                           already.
Change your oil, oil filter and fuel filter  - Start out right.
Carry 3 quarts extra oil. -  In case you lose your oil for any reason.
Have a tune-up done or do it yourself.  - If you drive an air-cooled VW
                                          you should at least learn how to 
					  tune it yourself.
align and balance the tires. - So you don't rattle your nerves. ;) 
Have the headlights aimed (With the car loaded) - Mis-aimed lights are
                                                  annoying
flashlight + spare batteries - You don't want to be in the dark.
A second flashlight. - In case the first don't work.
Sleeping bag. - It gets mighty cold at night.
Gallon Jug of drinking water - You could get thirsty or worse dehydrated.
First Aid Kit - Always 
bailing wire - To hold things together.
lug wrench - To remove wheels.
3' of pipe to put over lug wrench to loosen stubborn bolts.
food: granola bars and such. - You always get hungry when your stuck somewhere
Liquid Wrench - For those tough bolts.
WD-40 - Gets the grease off.
Spare fuses - Always have them.
Spare bulbs - Various ones for all the lights in your car.
Spare cash - Some people don't take credit cards or checks.
Waterless hand soap - To get the grease off your hands.
Book to read - To pass the time while you're waiting for the tow truck.
	       (or waiting for someone else to go get a tow truck) 
	       Or you could read the manual for your car and find out the
	       things you should have been doing for it.
Battery Terminal cleaner thingy - You know, the one with the wires in the doo-hickey.
Paper towels - There nice for cleaning up.
Small tarp - To put on the ground so you don't get too dirty.
Grubby cloths - To get dirty in.
Rags - To wipe off things on the car.
Gloves - For things to hot to handle.  Also for heavy duty stuff.


Enjoy the trip!
