Subject: 84 Westy Hydaulic Lifter problem

        I have been having problems with the hydraulic lifters loosing there 
oil fill on my 84 westy 1.9 liter water cooled engine.The heads were
recently removed and the lifters refilled and all reassembled and all
appeared fine for a
few weeks.I do not winter drive the westy so it sits for periods but I run
it every two weeks and let it warm up.Has any one else out there had this
problem an if so did you find a solutuon that did not involve repalcing the
lifters.
        One mechanic suggested that a mixture of transmission oil and
regular oil  run in the motor for a short period would refill the
lifters.Any experience
others may have had would be helpful.

Thanks
Joe
