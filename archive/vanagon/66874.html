&gt;Eric, and all others interested in the Stainless Exhaust.  It's being
made
&gt;by STEBRO EXHAUST in Manotick, Ontario, Canada.  The system is not ready
&gt;for sale yet that I know of, but I haven't been in touch with STEBRO for
a
&gt;couple of weeks.  At that time I was told the system would be ready for
&gt;sale in short while.  You can phone STEBRO at 613-692-4984 and talk to
&gt;Dan.  They have a web site but I don't have the address at hand.  Do a
&gt;search for STEBRO and you will find it.  They have an e-mail address also
&gt;which is on the web site when you get there.

Their phone number is 1.888.878-2276.  Their email address is
stebro_at_istar_dot_ca.  They hope to have the systems available within a month.
