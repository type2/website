They're not 1st my choice, but... I think those wheels are available
in 14&quot; and 15&quot; sizes. *If* you could get a wheel in the correct
offset, it is possible to have them drilled to match your bolt
pattern. It might be worth finding out the *largest* car the wheels
are designed for use on, then comparing the GVW with your bus. If
it's a lot less, then it's probably not a good idea. If the weight
is similar, and you don't plan on offroading, they may be ok.
I suspect it's a long shot though, since they're likely designed for 
lightweight fwd H*ndas &amp; such.
