G'day Sean

I've been reading this list with interest since I bought a 90 Vanagon 
(called a Caravelle here in Aussie) and have learnt a lot.

Sean, your problem is with the earth lead of the light. Make sure it is 
clean and secure to the body.

When the earth lead is poor the electrons find the easiest way to ground 
and that is through the other globes and back into the system. That's why 
the whole lot flashes like a Christmas tree when the indicator and brake 
light are on together.

Keep warm all of you, we are in the 13th day straight of max daytime temp 
over 90 degrees and thanks for an informative mailing list.
