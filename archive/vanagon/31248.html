&gt;&gt;Boy do I know the feeling! I put a unit in made by ARA. It uses an
&gt;&gt;electronic actuator (does not rely on a vacuum). It's worked great for the
&gt;&gt;last 6 years.
&gt;
&gt;Steve, any idea if that unit is still made? Or, do you know where that
&gt;company is located, and maybe their address or phone number?
&gt;I'd LOVE to get one of those.

here's the address/phone of the guy that still sells Zemco stuff. i've got
a Zemco trip computer in my 88 bus (my fourth bus that it has been in) and
i had a Zemco cruise control in my 73 bus, 80 bus, and 86 bus. it worked
really well in all three. (the 88 has factory cruise on it). and for all
you vanagon-fuel-tank/gauge haters, :)  the trip computer helps a lot with
knowing exactly how much fuel you've used (or have left).

Direct Buyer Service         Zemco Trip Computers,
P. O. Box 55303              performance analysis computers,
Portland, OR 97238           cruise controls, security systems
