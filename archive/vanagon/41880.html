Subject: need help on head replacement

Hi.  I hope somone can give me some info 'cause I'm relatively new to 
these sorts of repairs.  I just checked the compression on my 2 liter '79 
westy and it was 60 in cylinder #1 and 100 in the others.  I don't seem 
to be burning oil, and I've been told that I likely have a bad valve.
Does these seem the most plausible explanation?

Is getting a valve job the same as replacing the heads?  If not, what's 
the difference?  Also, how much should replacing the heads cost.  One guy 
has told me that each head cost $300 and that the whole job would cost 6 
hours labor?  Does this sound right?

I know these questions are basic for many of you, but I could sure use 
some help.  I'm on the road right now, so I'm afraid to continue on my 
trip until I know whether or not this is something I should attend to.

Thanks for the help.

david
