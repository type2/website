Subject: Re: Those pesky exhaust valves


&gt;I have electronic ignition on my honda 750.  The main reason for replacing 
&gt;the stock points was exactly what Dave said above.  I've set the timing once 
&gt;in 1-1/2 years and 13000 miles.  

I enjoy working on cars, but I DETEST setting points.  I would like to
switch to electronic ignition.  More reliable, and trouble-free.


&gt;Do you think that the 
&gt;cooling system on the 1500 had anything to do with the valve consumption?  
&gt;Did you have a non-doghouse setup?

Ditto.
