Subject: Inuvik trip on CBC Morningside!

Everybody!

Just heard from Christa that she is going to be interviewed by Shelagh
Rogers on CBC Radio's Morningside about the Inuvik trip.

For you non-Canadians out there, this is big.  WooHoo!!

Not only has our trip made what is undisputably the most popular morning
radio show in Canada, but the Inuvik trip will be the lead story, leading
off the three hour program.  Canadians can catch the interview at 09:05
local time on CBC AM.  I'll see if I can get them to cut a RealAudio file
of the interview, so all you 'net folks can listen to the interview too.

Christa and I have to go down to the CBC studio in Vancouver at 04:45
Monday morning for the interview, which will be conducted live.

I'll let you all know the details on the RealAudio, when I learn more.

Northward ho!

Tobin
