Subject: 84 VVanagon GL: Coolant stays in Round Coolant Reservoir

Hi everyone!

First of all, I'm happy that the Van passed the CA smog test!  And only
after several hundred dollars and a lot of heartache and headaches!  ;-)

I have a strange occurrence wherein the coolant, after the engine has cooled
down won't go into the 2ndary coolant reservoir (the square-ish one next to
the oil dipstick).  

Rather, the coolant stays in the main coolant reservoir (the more-spherical,
less squarish-one on the corner of the engine compartment near the left rear
blinkers).  

I don't remember it doing this.  Anyone have a similar experience?  What
could be the cause?

Thanks!
