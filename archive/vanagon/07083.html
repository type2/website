Subject: Re: EuroVan Fog Light Switch


PJ,

The switch does have two positions - one for front and one
for rear fogs. The rears come on in position one, and both
are on with the switch in position #2. I have the same
type switch in my 86 GTI, in fact the back of the two
switches (T4 and GTI) are the same...I figure that
VW just puts on a different plate on the front. 

I've used the GTI switch for years with both fogs..the swithc
handles the current, etc...no problem. There should be no
problem as long as the proper fuses and relays are used.

Ric
