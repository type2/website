&gt; 	But am I the only one out there who's torn the air 
&gt; conditioning out of his van? 
&gt; 	Ian Abbott

AIR CONDITIONING! I do spray Lysol every once in a while when the
pipe and cigar smell gets too overpowering for other humans. ;-&gt;

But seriously, when I bought my '71, the owner handed me the    
compressor in a box and said it used to work, but the bracket
cracked.  I promptly pitched it and took out the under-dash
blower (wired into the rear-window defroster switch, BTW). The
only remnants I have is a huge condensor under the pan and the
left-hand fresh air hose goes to the left instead of down......

Wilkommen, Ian!
