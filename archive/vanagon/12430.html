Well, according to my manuals.....
The stroke could possibly be either 30mm, or 36mm...(probably 30,
as the 36mm is the `reinforced version' 1500 model...)

Some misc. things my book tells me:
Make sure the vent hole in the cap is clear of obstruction to prevent a
vacuum or pressure from forming in the fluid reservoir.

A blocked by-pass port prevents the fluid from flowing back to the reservoir
when it expands under the influence of heat (continuous braking). The fluid
will then expand towards the wheel cylinders, overcome the return spring 
pressure and cause the brake shoes to drag continually on the drums (Stop
light remains on) Hmm. Sounds like your original problem.

Now for the troubleshooting guide:
SYMPTOM                         CAUSE                   REMEDY

Pedal goes to floorboard        a-check valve in master  a-renew checkvalve
without brake action, even      cylinder inoperative
though the system has been      b-check valve seat       b-clean or renew
bled and adjusted               dirty

The rest of it deals with leaks, air in the system, Weak piston return
spring, damaged or unserviceable cups in master or wheel cylinder, and
binding brakes, which isn't a problem anymore, correct?
Oil on brake shoe linings, all things I believe you've checked.
