Gosh, is it ever good to have free, unlimited local phone calls, with
unlimited access time to account.  Not to mention no lag.  :)

Anyway, I'm back from a 20 day trip Europe, which encompassed 9
countries and at least 4,000 miles of driving (most of it on the
German autobahn at speeds I'm still cringing from  :).  I'll write
something in the manner of a trip report, as soon as I get more caught
up.

In the meantime - yes, in answer to many of you - the April 27th camping
trip to Red Rock is still happening, as far as I know.  Stay tuned...as
soon as I wade thru another 1500 pieces of mail or so, I'll be right
with you...  :)
