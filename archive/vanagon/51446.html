Hello all,

I have a problem with my charging system, I think.  1987 Westy GL.

Original symptoms were gradually icreasing poor fuel effeciency.  Rough running
and surging at idle.  I left my refrigerator on a few weeks ago, and drained
the battery.  Battery system would not recharge.  After charging battery with
external battery charger, engine cranks and runs, albeit poorly.

I had Advance Auto test my charging system and here are the results.  My
battery is good, but not fully charged.  Just under 12 volts w/ engine off, but
engine will crank and run.  After engine running, the voltage at the battery is
about 12.8 V w/ engine speed at about 2000 - 2500 rpm.  At idle, engine surges
and runs rich.

I have pulled the alternator already to check the carbon brushes on the voltage
regulator.  The Brushes look good, no pitting or visible damage.  Real smooth
and lots of play in springs and making good contact.  Alternator does not make
any noise like bearings are shot and there is no play in the rotor.

Please help a poor college student out.

Does it sound like I need a new alternator?  Or could it be that I need a new
voltage regulator?  Will a new voltage regulator come with a new (or rebuilt)
alternator?  Should I stick with a rebuilt bosch unit if I have to go that
route, or has anyone had good success with another aftermarket brand?


Thank you so much for your help.

If the voltage regulator goes, should the symptoms be overcharging of the
system?  It appears that my problem is under-charging.  Voltage at battery
never gets above 12.8 V.
