Subject: Re: Pilot Bearing



&gt;Speaking from experience, the pilot bearing as it wears out caused me
&gt;the following symptoms. First, when one of the needles jumped out of
&gt;the rusty bearing, the tranny input shaft spun with the crankshaft.
&gt;That's like having a broken clutch cable. You can't shift at all.
&gt;That did't last long. The needle ground itself to dust. Eventually
&gt;all of the needles fell out. Then shifting and driving was just fine.
&gt;The second symptom is a good sized tranny oil leak, but only at high
&gt;speeds.  That one is a real mystery unless you know what a pilot
&gt;bearing is.  I replaced the rear tranny seal twice before somebody
&gt;told me about the pilot bearing.
&gt;
&gt;Moral: inspect and grease the pilot bearing every time you remove the
&gt;engine.


Well, Bob, the final obvious question, since it's been many years since
I've pulled an engine:

What is the pilot bearing?

Is it the needle-bearing arrangement inside the gland nut that holds
the flywheel on (except in Rhodes' bus :))?

Or is it the flat bearing on the clutch-throwout arm, that moves the
clutch together and apart (I thought this was called the throwout
bearing)?

I vote for choice 1,  tho I guess I'm not sure.
