Subject: Re: Another tire/ Bias ply

&gt;Guy I gave my '72 woodshed to has a Thing and many busses (aircooled). He 
&gt;says the Thing is useless in slippery stuff compared to the vans, too light 
&gt;for the tires to dig in and get traction (he was using snow tires in the 
&gt;mud). Strange, maybe too much power-to-weight ratio, comparitively speaking 
&lt;g&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Anyway just some usual ramblings.

&gt;
&gt;Ditto, tim s.

Well, while we are rambling, how about a limited slip transaxle for the bus? 
 I think that this couples with some good tires would be great in the snow.  
I think I saw the limited slip tranny add by Transform.  Anyone had any 
experience with this, or with transform?

tranny wearing quickly,
