Subject: New Westy Owner(and list)

Hello,
        I'm new to this list, just wanted to introduce myself and my newly
acquired 77 Westfalia (Kodak yellow/orange) named Petey (actually you have
to say it like Phil Hartman from SNL playing Frankenstein, long and drawn
out...Peeteeyy). There are a couple of questions I have (allready?)...


        The 12V Sink pump and switch are completely shot, need new ones.
Any suggestions as to where to locate these items or suitable replacements?


        Also, I seem to be leeking a bit of oil from the right side of the
engine (78 Hydr.Valv). I would assume it's more than likely the push rod
tubes. I've replaced these before in a 1600 Bug engine, same procedure or I
am better off taking it in? What sort of compression figures should I be
looking at for this engine?

        Future plans...Put in a gas stove, maybe have the Propane tank
under the stove where the spare tire is normally kept, and gas heater. Any
problems there?       Also would like to hook up another Marine type
battery in the back, with an Inverter and Isolater. How practical is
running things like a TV/VCR off a battery? 5 mins. of power? 2 Hrs?

        Sorry my first post is so long and full of questions, will try to
be as helpful as I can in the future!   Thanks   Tom Story
                                                San Francisco
