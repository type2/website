So Jack Agnew says:
&gt; Thanks again Joel - That is what I had understood as well, but I had 
&gt; certainly NOT heard anything about VW making a retrofit for the older CFC 
&gt; air conditioners. 
&gt; Being in the  San Francisco area, any time we head east at all ends us in 
&gt; a desert, we really need the airconditioning. I had heard that the 
&gt; substitute for Freon had been labeled a serious fire hazard and so it 
&gt; sort of dropped out of sight. 
&gt; We will just keep hoping that someone comes up with a Freon substitute 
&gt; that can be used directly.

I'm always find it amusing that most bay area folks think an AC is a waste
of money where they live.  Then they take a trip in the summer to the mountains 
which means they have to traverse the Central Valley summer.  So when they arrive 
at there camp sites, they look as though they've been through Hell.  You can
tell they've already are re-thinking the AC decision.  ;)
