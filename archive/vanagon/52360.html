Scott;
Since the rear brakes last so long (70k to 130k miles) and wheel
cylinders are so cheap($23) I recommend you replace them both at the
same time. 
Good Luck

&gt;I replaced the rear brake shoes on my '84 Vanagon GL.  The Bently

&gt;one side. I hope this was because I pushed the piston out too far and 
&gt;not a failing wheel cylinder?
