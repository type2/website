Subject:      mail from south america

i got a postcard in the mail today, and thought i'd share it with all the
&quot;old-timers&quot; on the list.

&quot;From William Warburton - on Tour in the Americas!

Hi Joel,

Thought I'd send a card from down here in Peru where every second car is a
Beetle and you can still buy Breadloaf buses brand new with an upright
1600cc engine!  Amazing to see a new one again after all these years.

Judy and I are having a great time and seeing all sorts of fascinating things
(including the total eclipse at the beginning of Nov.).  We're still hoping
to make the Great Trans-America Brick Tour, if it works out.  We'll try &amp;
contact David Schwarze early next year to see if it's still on.  Anyway,
hope you are doing well &amp; keep on VWing!
                                            Cheers,
                                                   W.&quot;

now &lt;joel again&gt;, i'm not so sure about this. the post card has the word
'FATTO' in big betters across the top of the back.  how he know? he ain't
never seen me!!!??? :)

joel
