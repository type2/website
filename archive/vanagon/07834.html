&gt;Now, if I can only figure out why the headlights go off and the radio 
&gt;stays on when I shut off the ignition ...  :-)
&gt;
Because they're meant too! You can just move the radio connection to an 
ignition  controlled terminal at the fuse panel if you don't like it. Might 
need a twinned spade lug to do it if those terminals are all full. My Rabbit 
shuts off the (factory) radio with the ignition, something I hate when 
waiting around, since all those red lights on the dash are annoying just to 
get the radio. My Honda has a radio only position on the switch, with the 
key in. I think VW wants you to enjoy the radio in your van when resting, 
without leaving any keys in the ignition. I usually rewire the radio to be 
available anytime, for convenience. The headlight thingie is for us absent 
minded professors, just like the drivers door requiring your key to lock it. 
I've still locked myself out BTW!  tim s.
