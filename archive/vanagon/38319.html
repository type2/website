&gt;Does anybody know if these valves can be changed independently from 
&gt;the heater core?.. it looks like it all comes apart, but who knows how 
&gt;VW sells these parts.  The Bentley doesn't say much about this 
&gt;heater, and is rather disapointing.   
&gt;
&gt;This is a major bummer... just had the cooling system pressure 
&gt;checked last week, and coolant flushed.  
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any words of wisdom

My 87 msprung a leak in the little white plastic vent-plug thing that screwes
into the valve.  I replaced it ( a couple of bucks at VW) and bought a spare
as well.  No leaks now.
