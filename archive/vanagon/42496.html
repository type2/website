Subject: Type IV valve adjust screw length

Volks,

        I need to know what the standard length of a valve adjusting screw
is for a Type IV ('72 1700) engine is.  I have measured mine at 26mm (a
little over 1 inches for you metrically challenged :-)).  If you have one
out and about, please measure and report to me. 

        Thanks in advance.
