Up until a few years ago, when we stopped having severe winters (global
warming?), one of the only vehicles that could make it through the two-foot
snows was my '79 VW Bus (with tire chains on rear).  We would sometimes pass
stuck 4x4s.  Towed lots of folks out of drifts.

Mud and snow tires, front and rear, are the best for severe winters, though.
Still need rear chains if snow is too deep.
