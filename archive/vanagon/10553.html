Greg: WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING?????


&gt;AS OF FRIDAY I BECAME THE NEW OWNER (3RD) OF A ORANGE 1981 VW WESTY. I CAN
&gt;RELATE TO THE WANNABUS FEELING.  JIM THANKS FOR ALL OF YOUR HELP, AND NO I HAVE
&gt; NOT GOTTEN MY HANDS DIRTY YET.  TRYING TO BALANCE SCHOOL FIRST, AND THIS NEW
&gt;COMPUTER IS GIVING ME A HARD TIME.  I GUESS IT IS LIKE MOST THINGS, SPEND
&gt;ENOUGH TIME FIDDELING WITH IT AND YOU'LL GET IT FIGURED OUT. THE TRICK IS NOT
&gt;TO BE AFRAID. I GUESS THAT WOULD BE KEY IN A LOT OF THINGS WE DO IN LIFE.  THE
&gt;STORY ABOUT THE AROUND THE WORLD TRIP WAS GREAT, BUT I THINK THAT MY FIRST BIG
&gt;TRIP IS GOING TO BE THE TOUR DEPONT. A WEEK IN THE BUS WATCHING BIKES SHOULD DO
&gt;MY SOUL SOME GOOD. THE OFFER STILL STANDS, HOPE YOU CAN SWING IT.  THE BUS HAS
&gt;AN ELECTRIC REFRIDGE SO THE BEER WILL STAY COLD.  NEED TO GO SO I'LL TALK WITH
&gt;YOU LATER.  VEE DUB BRO.     GREG
