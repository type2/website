Subject: Broken syncro rear spring (repeat)

The left rear spring is broken and the last turn on the top is missing.

I need advise:
1) are used springs ok?
2) should both left and right be replaced together?
3) are the rear springs from a 2wd the same as the syncro?
4) do you know of good sources (new or used) in the upper NY/NH/VT or
Ontario areas?

Any help is very much appreciated.
