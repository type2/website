Subject: Re: Taking out middle row in 7 seater
Date: Wed, 19 Feb 1997 22:40:43 -0000

&gt; &gt;When you slide the middle row double seat out, do you have to remove the
&gt; &gt;carpet? In our 84 GL the carpet covers up the runners in the floor. I
had
&gt; &gt;to cut a line in the carpet from the seat to the sliding door - is this
&gt; &gt;usual?
&gt; 
&gt; All you WOULD have had to do is unscrew the sliding door threshold,
remove
&gt; the rear seat kickpanel, and pull up the carpet (it ain't glued
down).....
&gt; 
&gt; too late now, I guess.....
&gt; 
&gt; another 7 pass with shredded carpet.....  :&lt;)

Its a fair point!-)

But a) the carpet was very old and dirty - the PO had 6 kids compared to my
4, and in the light of that, b) I wanted really quick access to removing
the seat without rolling up so much carpet.

I had previously assumed that the seat unbolted and lifted straight up
rather than sliding out. The reason I want quick access is that I am in the
process of putting a rearward facing seat in the boot with 3 seat belts. So
I can get 5 adults and 3 kids, and remove the middle 2-seater for a huge
luggage space.

If the cut in the carpet gets ruched up too much I may well replace the
carpet. Do people prefer synthetic or wool based?
