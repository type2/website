Subject: 88 Westy Water Tank gauge

My water tank gauge always reads full, so I removed the sender last 
night. The plastic magnet thingy seems to slide fine &amp; moving it with 
wires attached has no effect on the gauge. Anyone tried to fix one of 
these before?

Also, at 322K, the tank is pretty grungy - I was thinking of running 
bleach through it to clean the tank and lines (some show mildew 
inside... yuck) then rinse well &amp; do a final rinse with some baking 
soda. Any problems with this, or better solutions?

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
