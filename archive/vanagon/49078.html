    You've got to be joking... I have done some real stunts
    but never rolled.... Obviously your going to try this again?

&gt; My previous bus met with an untimely end in a rollover.  We went 1 
&gt; and 1/4 rolls.  Landed on the right side.  This was in a blizzard.  
&gt; We got out the driver's door, but when we returned it had frozen 
&gt; tight.  Got back in through the pop-top that had been popped loose.  
&gt; The back hatch was also frozen.
&gt; Anyway, when we got our 'new' bus, an '80, the thought of being over on 
&gt; the passenger side without another exit than the driver's door hung 
&gt; in my and my wife's mind.  That's all background.
&gt; I took off the interior rear panel and found out that there is a 
&gt; piece of metal that when pushed will open the rear hatch even if the 
&gt; hatch is locked.  I covered the metal with shrink wrap to prevent 
&gt; cuts and cut a finger sized hole in the panel.  So now I have an 
&gt; emergency exit at the rear.  For a cleaner approach, I would remove 
&gt; the wood portion of the panel and just leave covering intact so it 
&gt; would look original.  But mine had already cracked from a kayak 
&gt; hauled inside the bus.
