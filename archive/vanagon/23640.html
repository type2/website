Subject:       Re: How to LEVEL VAN when camping?

Hi Louise.  We use our sliding door as a level, and the view from the 
dash and rear view mirror to check for cross slope.  If the sliding 
door is steady... we're level.  I use the rearview mirror as a 
projection to a horizon... works pretty close.  

I carry 4 small 2X4 blocks of wood to level up if I have to.  I can 
make a ramp out of them by crossing them over eachother.  If I can't 
get level with the wood I bring, I either choose another site, or dig 
holes for the wheels (and fill them in when I leave).

Harry.

&gt; Would like some suggestions on ways and means to get the van (the &quot;Villa&quot;)
&gt; level when camping, without too much fuss and jigs.
&gt; Thanks.
