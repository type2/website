        I know someone else had this prob. a week ago or so, and I apologize
for bringing it back up, but my mud flap finally broke off. I think I'll be
able to just redrill 3 holes and screw it back onto the mounting bracket,
but did anyone have a price, or info on a new one? That, or any other
solutions to this little problem.
        On my weekend trip, I discovered just what its for just by not
having it. My propane tank and propane gaurd were covered in mud and dirt.
Makes it kinda crappy to turn the shutoff/on valve.
