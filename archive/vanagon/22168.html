Subject: Re: EuroVan

The following was mentioned in the original post:
&gt;EuroVan a little scarry to me because of front drive and
&gt;5 cyl. engine. Also, concerned that EuroVan essentially discontinued...
&gt;Don't want to end up with animal I can't get parts or service for...

Front wheel drive...scarry??? And you SAY you own a rabbit???

There is NOTHING wrong with the handling of a EuroVan...in fact
it will out handle (IMHO) ANY VW rear-engined van..and the shitboxes
from Chrysler, GM and FORD...and most other CARS for that matter..


What do you perceive as wrong with the 5 cyl enine? Its the same
engine that has been in the Audis and other VW products since
the mid-80s...with proper care and maintainance it should last
for at least 200K miles...

Discontinued?? Gee...I still can get parts and service on my '56
beetle at my local dealer...got it for my 79 Convertible...
so parts and service should be there for the long haul...

As far as discontinued...first of all production/sales are
going strong in Europe where the T4 is the top selling
van in its class...it looks like the EV will be returning
to the US with a V6 in 1996...

GO FOR IT!! The EV is a great van...I have 36k miles on mine
and am thoroughly satisfied...as are the other EV owners
on this list.
