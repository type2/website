Subject:      EVC Web Page

Well, various appliance woes sorta forced the background task to the
foreground, and I now have *a start* at a Web page for EV Camper info.

http://www.halcyon_dot_com/rickgo/EV/welcome.html

It's not very complete yet. Intent is to provide general overview as well
as a place where people can send problem reports. That way the EVC owners
can spot trends from our limited sample and perhaps collaborate on getting
problems fixed .

anyway, i'm tired. there'll be more. check it out.
