Subject: Vanagon springs

A week or so ago I posted a message about my listing-to-the-left Westy. 
I've decided I need new springs.

Jim at Bus Boys sent me a message about a spring set they offer for $495. 
My only reservation: these springs are the 45mm lower ones which come 
stock on 88 and later busses; mine is an 86. Jim is sure they work great 
on earlier vans, but do lower the vans by 45mm. He says he has used these 
springs on his 80, and the handling is great.

Have any of you used these, or heard of anyone who has? Is the only 
difference between the early and later suspensions the springs, or are 
other parts different too?

Lastly, has anyone had any experience with Bus Boys lately?

Thanks a bunch.

Dave Garth
86 Westy
