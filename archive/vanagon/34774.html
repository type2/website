&lt;Is it
&lt;honestly a match or superior to the Chrysler products.&gt;

Chrysler? I didn't know they made vans. I thought they were still making
overated bloated station wagons! :)

The EV is a great way to get around. I would highly reccommend one. I can say
the EV has a TON more room than the Chrysler has. Probably the only drawback
of the EV would be highway speed. My EV MV is a few ticks over 4000 at 80mph
so I guess if you wanted to blast cross country it would be a problem (you
can't really say &quot;VW&quot; and &quot;speed&quot; in the same sentence anyway).

The EV will be back but I think the 5 cylinder is a thing of the past.

Best o' luck in your search!
