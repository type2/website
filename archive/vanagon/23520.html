                      RE&gt;&gt;VW Engine Fires (was: seat belts,...       8/25/95

All of usn's be advised - dry powder chemical fire extinguishers ( the typical
5 BC type, about 4&quot; in diameter maybe 14&quot; long) have a less than sterling
reputation for working as designed when put to the ultimate test.  What
happens is that although the compressed nitrogen gas charge may well be
intact, the powder that it it is supposed to propel by pressure and a siphon
tube ( just like a CO2 soda siphon) too frequently does not propel the full
powder charge.  What too frequently happens is that over time, partially due
to plain old gravity settling, and probably aggravated by vibration, the
powder gradually packs down from a nice fluffy loose pile to a densely packed
&quot;cake&quot; that is impossible to blow up the siphon tube.  

The GOOD news - That's why there is a professional business that takes (the
larger versions that we tend to see in buildings and offices) these types of
extinguishers for service on a regular annual or so basis.  What they do is
relieve the gas pressure in the &quot;bottle&quot; and save the powder.  They fluff up
the powder charge, top off the quantity if necessary, and pour it back into
the bottle and recharge the gas charge.  This is supposed to ensure that the
powder won't have settled into a solid cake when you need it. 

The BAD news -  Most small units that individuals own are not manufactured to
allow this type of servicing, and the outfits that service the units for
business won't touch them because of the typical plastic valve head assembly
isn't safe to disassemble and then re-assemble.  What you can do is
periodically take you unit and invert it, shake it up, tap gently with a
rubber hammer while inverted, etc. to try and &quot;fluff&quot; up the powder charge.

Don't mean to discourage you about this, but I figure it's better you know
what tends to really happen than for all of us to be &quot;fat dumb and happy&quot;
because we are prepared and  have a fire extinguisher in the car or house when
in reality - - - 

By the way - if you happen to have a HALON unit, the above does not apply. 
HALON is a gas that liquefies readily under relatively low pressures and so is
stored in the container as a liquid until released.  It is quite effective,
doesn't leave that horrible hard to clean up residue behind, but is no longer
available as a fire fighting agent because it was said to be bad for the
ozone.  So if you have any of these units, they'll probably do their intended
job quite well within the limits of their size, and you won't find a
replacement for them.
