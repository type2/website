Subject: Help-83 pop top seal

        I know I asked about this once before but I never really figured
out what I should do about it.
The Problem: My black rubber seal that goes around the bottom of the
pop-top peice is starting to rot (or a least in spots it is) and peel off.
        I called the dealership and the replacement is $533. There is no
way in hell that I would ever pay that so.......has anyone done this repair
before? I was hoping that I could simply peel off the exsisting
one...scrape off all the gunk and junk, then reglue it on.

        Inquire mind would like to know.
