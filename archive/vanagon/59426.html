Subject: Re: FWD: Westie Owners

Responding to your quest to buy a used Westie in Europe. 
Maybe we can work a deal.
I want to buy a Westie for use in Poland and would consider buying it off
you after your 6 months are up. I will be in Europe for 3-4 years so 6
months &quot;abstinence&quot; wouldn't be so bad. Besides, I probably need several
months to earn enough cash to pay for the Westie.

&gt; I'm traveling to Europe next month, looking to buy a used Westie ($10,000, 
&gt; sell it there when finished after 6 months or so) any tips on what's 
&gt; available, what to avoid, insurance costs the petrol vs. diesel vs. propane 
&gt; question? I need either an European or American who has done the same thing to 
&gt; contact me. Thanks!
