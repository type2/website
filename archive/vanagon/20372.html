Subject: Austin area parts?

Hey now,
        I'm kinda new to the Austin area, and looking for some parts
places. So far, the folks who sell the familiar packages have very
unfamiliar prices-about twice what I paid out in L.A. The guys that I found
in the phone book wanted $110+ (!!!) for a '70 1600 generator, reman.
Bosch. The door handle (type II front outside) was $15-used (and junk, I
might mention). I bought the other one a year ago for $12-new! Any clues
where I can get parts and still have enough dough for the peanut butter for
the CV joints?   ;-)

Peace,
