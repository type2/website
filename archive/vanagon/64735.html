FYI on a similar problem: msn just announced they are changing their mail
addressing, so anyone who's been on a list server for some time will start
having mail refused because the return address will be different than the
address under which they subscribed. So msn suggests unsubscribing and then
resubscribing to get the address right. Of course I don't think the
unsubscribe command will work because it will come from an unknown return
address....

I've tried out msn for a couple months, and the mail system isn't good - at
least once a week it can't connect to my mail, etc. Time to try something
else, or claim my 12-yr-old Compuserve account back from my son.

Approximately 80+% of our mail delivery errror messages come from only 2-3
Internet nodes (e.g., AOL, Compuserve). Most
of these are &quot;FULL MAILBOX&quot; or &quot;ADDRESSE UNKNOWN&quot; errors.  &lt;snip&gt;
