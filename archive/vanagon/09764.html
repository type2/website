Subject:       cleaning up that ratty idle

Mike P. wrote asking us for help in getting the rats out of his 
engine:

Here's my fix that worked on my '85, I'd posted this earlier but I 
didn't keep a copy and I'm don' feel up to an archive search this 
early in the am.

1.  Clean all engine grounds, ie the main one on the left side of the 
block but check others.

2.  Switch to the expensive-but-worth-it 3prong spark plugs

3.  Replace your plug wires.  NAPA has a nice set for around $60-80.  
I hate the quality of their water-pumps but their wires for the 
vanagon are nice.

4.  Clean your fuel injectors with a fuel injection cleaner system 
that taps into the fuel rail... NOT one of those cans of mystery 
cleaners you add to your gas.  Well you can use those (Techron is 
probably the best) but don't expect miracles.  I'll try to post a 
note later on the fuel injection cleaner system I made.  Essentially 
it uses a LARGE can of 3M brand EFI cleaner and has the engine 
literally run off this can until it is empty.  Cool stuff.

These mods changed my '85 from an embarassing ratty idle to a smooth 
hum and I don't have the compression you do.
