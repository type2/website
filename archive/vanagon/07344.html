In that one transporter book, I can't remember the name, in the back they
have a section on bus multilations.

These are all splits, BTW:

There is panel shortie with a snowplow gizmo on the front...

There is a bus with a another pus, from the middle up, wlded on top,
kinda like a double decker.

I saw a bus at a Dead show here in sac that had what looked like a 
fighter plane cokpit mounted on top.

I also saw a bus in one the VW T&amp;A rags a few years ago that was extended by
added a second bus on the back.  This one actually looked good, and I 
think if you hadn't know better, you'd thinkit was stick.

Lastly, in our local paper a few months ago, there was a bus listed for
sale, with the description &quot;extended 5 feet&quot; which piqued my curiosity,
but not enough to actually go an look at it.
