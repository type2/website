Subject: Digifant Vanagon Missing (was 89 SYNCRO engine hestaition)

This does not just affect syncros, but all later vanagons  with
digifant fuel injection. The VW recommended correction is a $100 wiring
harness. Here is the relevant quote from technical bulletin 92-01, 
originally courtesy of Joel:

SERVICE
Harness, Part No. 025 906 302, is available to resolve this condition.
* remove electrical connector from air flow sensor (see Figure 24-174)
* install converter assembly, Part No. 025 906 302, between harness and
  air flow sensor

Rick Koller did this fix and it worked for him....
