Subject: Re: Question on VIN info file....


&gt;Can anyone explain this claim about the extra 1.6 inches?

Is it because of the rubber strips on the bumpers? Or did other years have
these as well? Or maybe they put bigger mirrors on. There's definitley no
differences in body panels between a '78 and '79.
