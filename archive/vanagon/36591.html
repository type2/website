I know that this may seem petty, but when you wish to reply to someone's
post, perhaps a judicious use of editting may come in handy. Quote just
enough material so that your readers may understand your response. Please
don't repost the entire original posting (especially the longer ones). Some
of us may gripe about the use of excessive bandwidth but then turn right
around and completely repost the original we are responding to. This may
save us all some time as we read through the wonderful info. that is
presented on this list.
