I too had problems with my camper wiring.  I installed a completely 
separate fuse box behind the drivers seat on the front cabinet wall 
just for the camper.  Also, my dancinglights panel was always ON. I'm 
hoping that it was due to being an early '80.  I put in a switch so I 
can watch dacninglights only when I wanted! (and save on battery)

&gt; The fuse that controls the water pump for the sink keeps blowing. I have
&gt; replaced the water pump and now my electronic water level gauge / battery
&gt; condition meter is not working and the pump won't pump.  (I know this is vague)
&gt; but has anybody had this problem???
&gt; 
&gt; If I need to replace the electronic gauge (the dancing lights on the face 
&gt; plate of the cooker / sink, does anybody have a source who can rebuild
&gt; these (VW in Canada has no more)?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the help
