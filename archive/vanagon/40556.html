Subject: What IS The Original Factory Interior Color Of My 1973 Bus?
Date: Thu, 25 Apr 96 15:38:00 PDT


I Know This Is A Silly Question... But I Have No Idea What The Origional   
Interior Colors For My Bus Could Have Been.
The PO Had The Seats Re-Done In A Beige.  The Headliner Is White With   
Tiny Dots. (Sort of Looks Like Vent Holes On A Leather Glove.)

The Exterior Paint Used To Be A Dark Blue.

Any Help Would Be Great.  (BTW, No, I Don't Have The VIN Number Handy...   
The Bus Is In The Shop Finishing It's New Clutch)

Thanks!
 -Eric B.
