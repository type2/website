                             Trip Logs

My paternal grandfather was born in the 1860's, the exact year unclear
because that page of the Bible in which his birth was recorded was marred by
water stains and mildew.  The date could have been 1863 or 1868, even 1865 if
you squinted at it just right.  Grandpa used all three at different times,
depending on whether he wanted to be younger or older.  My grandmother,
grandpa's third wife, put 1863 on his gravestone.

Living 96 years and vigorous to the end, my grandfather engaged in a number
of occupations, changing them to keep up with the changing times.  For
example, he was a teamster for many years, managing thirty-two oxen
outspanned in sixteen pairs to pull a train of enormous freight wagons,
hauling heavy machinery to the gold mines.  When trucks replaced wagons my
grandfather changed occupations, although the term 'teamster' is still often
applied to truck drivers.

As a teamster my grandfather had an intimate knowledge of the roads and
trails of northern California, southern Oregon and northwestern Nevada.  His
journals are a goldmine of information about those routes and times.  

Automobiles arrived long before the age of paved roads and automobile travel
between towns was often a perilous undertakening, a thing to be prepared for
in the offing, recorded in the doing and shared when the trip was complete,
to guide those who dared follow.  The California Automobile Club encouraged
its members to submit trip logs, and from them published helpful maps and
guides, showing the location of water and fuel.

All roads were equally bad in those days, a trip to Loreto in Baja California
as difficult as the track between Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Yet people
made those trips, armed with a hundred-weight of tools and a bundle of notes
from those who had gone before.  Many of those notes were in my grandfather's
spencerian hand.  'Keep left of the oak in crossing,' invaluable advice when
fording the Merced River south of Hilmar, for bridges were as rare as
pavement in those olden days.

Trip logs appear to have skipped a generation in my family.  My dad's habit
was to make neat little sketches of things he found of interest.  I jot notes
of time and mileage, more to keep track of how the vehicle is performing
rather than any need to guide some future traveler through the perils of an
LA rush-hour, in which several trillion dollars of roadway are converted into
the worlds most expensive parking lot.

Sometimes a trip will be so unusual that the notes nudge me toward the
typewriter to be fleshed out and dated and stuffed into a binder for
generations yet unborne.  The trip to Tehachapi was like that, with such an
exceptional mix of rain and wind that a fuller account seemed justified.
 Indeed, after it was written I learned an incredible thirteen inches of rain
fell that day, as measured at Mt. Wilson, around which my route was centered.
 The next day Mark Stephens shop was snowed-in.  A personal account of a
journey on that day might be of interest to future travelers.

But times change.  The oxen are gone.  Paving is common.  The AAA magazine no
longer includes trip logs.  And my report of the run to Tehachapi generated a
number of negative responses about wasting time and bandwidth, causing me to
wonder if this was a tradition best continued in private.  When I said as
much in a public posting to this list I was unprepared for the overwhelming
response.

I use the internet primarily for private communications, private posts easily
outnumber my public posts by a hundred to one.  I post articles publically
when I feel they will be appreciated by a fair percentage of that particular
list's subscribers.  Such appreciation is rarely indicated.  There are always
the polite few whose responses I value, but there is also always the impolite
few, for whom I suspect even news of the Second Coming would be greeted with
derisive and scatological comments.  Indeed, the impolite posters are a
constant.  No matter what the content of the post, they take the time to find
something negative to say, although their numbers are usually balanced by
more positive responses.  In the case of the Tehachapi run, the impolite
nay-sayers outnumbered all others.

After posting my question about future trip reports my mail box was jammed
with traffic. I lost track of the positive responses somewhere around the
hundred mark. 

So this is a general Thank You to the list.  You've shown me what I should of
realized all along, that the quiet majority who find some value in such
positings far outnumber the noisy few who do not, and even when a post is not
appreciated, it is tolerated, for it reflects a media and form of expression
that if trampled will ultimately cause more harm than good.

I made a concerted effort to respond to each of you individually but fear
several messages fell through the cracks.  I offer the above partly in
explanation for my lack of manners but also to encourage you to share your
experiences with the list and to not be put off by the sharp retorts of a
disgruntled few.
