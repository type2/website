Subject: was that your van?

i was sitting in emeryville watching traffic crawl along the freeway,
munching on some fries and drinking a diet coke and being glad of NOT
being out there in it, and i noticed that i was in the sybase parking lot. 

so i looked around to see if i saw any likely looking vans parked there.

was that your westfalia i saw there?

i drove in a tight circle around it a couple of times, i was looking at 
how well the pop-top fits on our eurovans. or WOULD fit on mine if it 
WERE a pop-top.

i was just wondering. there are so many VW vans around here that i am
trying to go back to NOT noticeing them, the way i did before joining this
mailing list. 

almost everytime i see one now i wonder if it's somebody in the list.
