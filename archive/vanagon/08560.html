On the bug, before the oil cooler was shifted, the # 3 exhaust valve would
normally run the hottest of the four and so it was agood idea to set it
in extra thousand open. I have a #3 exhaust valve ('69 KG Cabrio in
storage) sitting on my desk
here; it is warped and has a chip out of it. Before it and the others were
replaced , I could hear a tick tick tick sound which I guess was gas
escaping past the valve. Anyway, now with the 2 litre and even 1.6 litre in
the European Vanagon, the oil cooler is not even near the #3 cylinder and
I have heard different views on whether #.3 still runs hot. Some have said
it does, others say it runs the same as the others. In addition I have
heard something about welding or strenghthening no.3 cylinder on bus
engines, which would suggest it might be prone to overheating. Can anyone
clarify this? TIA - DC
