Subject: window out, window in

	I did it!  I finally swapped out the standard left
side sliding window for the Westphalia one I got last fall
(before the snows began).  I did break down and use a new
rubber gasket, but all went well.  Just used a length of 
venetian blind cord, and a spray of silicone lube around the
edge.  No more jumping up in the dark and trying to carefully
remove the screens with out breaking them when the storm starts.
Thanks to whomever suggested putting in that plastic chrome 
decoration BEFORE installing the window.  Now all I have to
do is find the right side set.

	I have an '85 weekender, and must put the screens in 
every time they are needed, not like the Westphalia ones which 
are left in all the time.  

	As a result, I have the original, in excellent shape, left-
side window, tinted glass, used rubber gasket and all as a give-away.
If any one needs this, please send e-mail to flminor_at_clark_dot_net.
I live in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C.
