Subject: WD-40 ain't lubricating oil, etc.

	Volks,
	If you want lubrication, use an oil or a grease. Light machine
oils like 3-in-1, etc, or light greases like Libriplate will FAR outlast
WD-40 in light-duty applications. If you want real oil, engine
or tranny oil are obvious choices but there should be a mfgr's recomendation
if real oil is required- follow that, keep life simple. 
	Greases come in at least two obvious grades: High temp for disk-
braked wheel bearings and High pressure for CV joints and other VERY severe 
load environments.  If you have either, you'll need both one day.
	There are also cheaper wheel-bearing greases for low temp, low-
pressure applications. I just use the high-temp stuff in place.

	WD-40 is a WATER DISPLACER. It is not intended to lubricate, clean
or do anything except penetrate under a film of water and protect whatever
the water is standing on from corrosion. Freshly sprayed, it CAN lubricate,
and has considerable solvent abilities (since its kerosine + some light
oil apparently)- I clean parts with it some times.) But it ain't oil for
lubricating. It mostly evaporates and what's left turns gummy with time 
and exposure to air.

	Liquid Wrench, etc, are penetrating oils- very volitile, very low
surface tension liquids which will help un-stick corroded or dirty fasteners.
Obviously you should clean this stuff off whatever you put it on when the
fastener loosens up. WD-40 would be good for such a clean-up.

	Anti-Seize compounds are medium oils with graphite and other additives
which you can apply LIGHTLY to fasteners which may be subjected to heat
or other high-corrosion environments. Use a good anti-seize and you
won't need the Liquid Wrench so often.

	Happy Motoring!
	Bill
