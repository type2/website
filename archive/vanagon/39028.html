The rack you saw is a Paulchen, made in Germany. They are very cool and 
will carry up to four bicycles. Very modular with many attachments. 
Designed for mounting on vertical rear hatches, ideal for Vanagons. Since 
they are designed and manufactured in W Germany, I imagine they were 
designed especially for Vanagon (that's what's on their literature). I 
really want one of these, but can't stand the price. They are not imported 
into US as far as I know, but I found a dealer near Vancouver BC that will 
order them. Here's some data:

basic rack: $US350
4 pr skis: $US100
2 bicycles: $US 180
