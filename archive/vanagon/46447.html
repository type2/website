Bob 'Veeduber' says:


&quot;Water-cooled's are orphans...&quot;

&quot;...the typical owner of a water-cooled VW van is not only less 
mechanically adept than air-cooled owners, they seem less willing to 
acquire the skills and invest in the tools that would keep their 
orphaned vehicles alive, a failure of spirit...&quot;

'dem sounds like fightin' words!! ;)

Come on, really? The list is usually a great beginning to my morning. 
Thanks Bob.
