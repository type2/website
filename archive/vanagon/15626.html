So David Schwarze says:
&gt; &gt; David Schwarze, are you listening?  HOT water, AC, showers, and REAL
&gt; &gt; toilets  :) 
&gt; 
&gt; Only Martha Rubin could get *that* excited over a friggin toilet!

You got that right David!  I still don't see what was wrong with the
ones at RR.  Ya even got a beautiful skylight and AC ta boot!  ;)

&gt; You mean *none* of the above people are going to be participating in GNATT?
&gt; :(  That's a shame.  I will be in Yellowstone during that time, conjuring

Nothing is set in stone for me David, although Bodega is more likely.  The
reversal of the direction of the GNATT really screwed me up.  I wasn't
paying attention to what was happening to the dates. :(  But I'll try
to squeeze some time out of my boss and make it to some of it.  I spect'
there'll be more to come for years.
