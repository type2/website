Allrightythen!

	This weekend I was takin' easy, nursing a cold and all, which was
kindova a bummer 'cause my favorite surf spots were hitting 8 foot!

	Anyway, I decided to tackle the windshields.  I cut and chipped
the rubber off the drivers side, and then set to hacking out the rust.
I got it cleared up most of the way, 'cept for some pits I couldn't
get into.  So I got some of this stuff called Extend, made by Duro, the
same company that makes Navel (sic) Jelly.  It cost just under $7 for
a small bottle (can't remember the exact size)

	This stuff is a thin, milky gray liquid that you brush on and are
s'posed to be able to paint over, unlike NG which you have to clean
back off first.  When you first put it on, it looks kinda greenish, then
eventually turns black.  You can then sand it off and paint over it.

	Has anyone tried this stuff?  I went ahead and tried it, so we'll see
what happens.  Normally I'm sceptical of miracle chemicals, but since its
from a company whose stuff I've already used before, I figgered I'd 
give it a try.  It looks OK so far, but the instructions say to let
it dry 48 hours in a moisture free enviro before you mess with it.  
The only probelm is, the bus has to sit outside, and altough its covered, 
this morning I say that the window frame got dewed :(

	Next I'll finish cleaning it up and put the window back in with
new seals.  Bummer I don't have the cash laying around, 'cause this 
is a perfect window of opportunity to install safaris! :(

See ya,
