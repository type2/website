Well, just wanted to say that I went to my local John Deere Ag. Equip. dealer
and bought the plug for the westy dash socket that someone had mentioned they
carried there. Sure enough, it was the right one, had the little BOSCH emblem
on it and everything. Once again, the part number was RE11344 as previously
mentioned. The price was about 8 dollars (varies from each dealer).

If you hurry up you can still catch the sale on Ammonium Nitrate fertilizer.
