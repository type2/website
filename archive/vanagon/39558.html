Greetings all,

After taking a two month break from work I am back and glad to have the list 
to enjoy each day.

Anywho, I am in the midst of a head job and while they are at the shop I 
have been picking around at various components that I wouldn't normally be 
able to get at without the engine being removed from the bus.  Last night I 
noticed that the Thermostat has been removed from the engine and the flaps 
for any air flow have just been left wide open.  Muir does not recommend 
this, but with summer coming along, is it a good idea to not install the 
Thermostat at all and leave the flaps open?  Anyone else have this sort of 
set-up?

Of course, this is an '83 Air-Cooled Vanagon.

Thanks,
Bill Ernest
