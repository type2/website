Subject: Re: Alloy Wheels - again!

Tom -
	Keep in mind that the Syncro is a much heavier vehicle and is intended
for a different use (ie more off road, etc.) You guys also often use winches
and 'cattle guards' and other add-on equipment.
	For a standard Westy I know the tire pressure of 36/38 front and 44
rear is what I was running. Unfortunately I can't just run out and check the
door jam since my old one is somewhere east of here in a yard and my new one
is still in MN. But I was told by list members that I should count on a 
1300 lbs/wheel wt in the front and a 1500 lb/wheel load in the rear - fully
loaded. I also know that the Michelins are what are standard eq and on my
'80 I ran Pirelle radials at 44 psi in the rear with no problem.
	I am a little worried about the Pirelles listed below with the H 93
rating, but two well schooled tire people at different locations have told
me that these are clearly heavy enough for my Westy. According to their 
technical mannuals these appear to be OK for the non Syncro.
	I do think we have to be clear on the difference in requirements of the
Vanagon vs. Westy vs. Syncro vs. Syncro Westy. Each is increasingly more
heavy, and the 2 vs 4 wheel drive also makes a significant difference on tires.

	Why would VW spec out and use Michelin MVX radials of the 205 70/R14
size if they were not appropriate for the Westfalia?

&gt; 
&gt; Oh no! I can't believe we are doing this  :-)!
&gt; 
&gt; Kenyon is considering various wheels and tires:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Michelin MXV4 radials : H 95 rated (snip)--or
&gt; &gt;Pirelle P4000 : H 93 rated (snip)
&gt; &gt;(snip): 205/65 HR15s Michelin Energy MXV4 radials : H 94 rated 
&gt; 
&gt; I want to focus here on the load ratings: the &quot;95&quot;, &quot;93&quot; and &quot;94&quot;
&gt; in the tire specs above.  On my '90 Syncro Westie, and on my buddy's
&gt; '90 Carat, the tire spec sticker in the front driver's door jamb
&gt; specifies a 
&gt; variety of tires, either with 6 or 8 plys, or reinforced with  with &quot;97&quot;
&gt; load ratings. 
&gt; 
&gt; I thought the factory sticker called out &quot;97&quot; as the minimum for tires
&gt; that carried load ratings (truck tires don't have these numbers, I
&gt; think) anything lower -like the ones Kenyon is looking at- does not
&gt; really have the load capacity for the vehicle. 
&gt; 
&gt; Am I wrong?
