Subject: Teutonix Referral


A friend and I were on vacation and driving through South Carolina
on I-95 when we lost a head gasket on my wasserboxer.  It was
recommended that we be towed about 50 miles away from the road to a
place called Teutonix on Hilton Head Island.  I thought that we were
being &quot;hooked&quot; off of the road, but hey, Hilton Head has a beach and
I was getting hungry anyway. Sometimes you just have to take a
chance, you know?  Turned out, these guys were a father and son shop
who had been working on just VWs &amp; Audis for about a thousand years.
 They had everything in stock to do the job, had me back on the road
ASAP, AND charged me about a third less to do both head gaskets than
I would have paid my local guy here in Atlanta. I've put about
80,000 miles on those new head gaskets, and no problems with them.
If I bought another VW, I definitely would want to live near that
shop.  Norman (the father-unit) actually has a running 74 Dasher
that he bought new in '73 from his then employer] What further
qualifications do you need for parts &amp; service than that?  I felt
like I was in VW central when I was in that shop.  They've got parts
hanging here, there, lock knobs, window cranks, trim clips, complete
motors, you name it.  I recommend them highly.
