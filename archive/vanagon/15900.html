David,

Let me preface all that follows with the fact I've only a casual
acquaintance with Type IV's; I've hung some on airplanes,
fiddled with a couple of 411's (plugs, etc), but after an initial
read of your reply, I don't see any problem with your engine.

I would verify the pressure gauge; your manual should illustrate
some method of doing this.  And I would familiarize myself with
the geometry of the lubrication system in order to put the
pressure reading into the correct context; pressure drops across
the system, the pressure is higher nearer the pump than farther
away.

You appear to have drawn the correct conclusions although you may
not be giving the stock cooler enough credit in the strength
department.  The oven-brazed aluminum coolers seldom fail below
200 psi.  (The gasket usually fails first.)  Your pressure
control spring should have done its thing long before that.

It would be smart to distrust the EMPI cooler.  Given it's
location, I think you would want the steel cooler I mentioned in
an earlier posting.  They are threaded 1/2 NPT so you can use
just about any type of fitting/hose combination.  Although I
remain partial to the certified stuff.  Just remember, if you
lose a hose at speed AND YOU NOTICE IT IMMEDIATELY you've got
about fifteen seconds to make half a dozen correct decisions to
keep from: 1- getting smashed by the guy behind you, 2- trashing
your engine, 3- giving someone a lot of money.  (That's why race
cars are fitted that HUGE red oil pressure warning light.  Some
even add warning horns.)

Years ago I was told 7psi and 6 oz/minute would lubricate a VW
1200cc engine at 1000 rpm.  The guy who told me was a German-
trained VW mechanic.  (No, he didn't say &quot;Six ounces.&quot;  He showed
me a Coke bottle and said 'about that much')  I've never explored
that edge of the envelope but I've never heard that data disputed
by anyone of equal stature.  Call that the Lubrication Factor. 
Then comes the Heat Transfer Factor (or cooling factor -- the oil
is your primary heat transfer fluid [gasses and liquids are both
referred to as 'fluids' in thermodynamic equations]) and after
that comes the Hydraulic Factor.  Same oil.  Three jobs.  

The higher pressure in the Type IV's is probably an artifact of
running hydraulic lifters, the more restrictive (but more
effective) cooler and so forth.  The lubrication side of the
equation could probably be met with much lower pressure, although
the engine would be noisy (lifter clack) and might run hotter
(reduced flow through the cooler).  This would rapidly age
compounded oil which in turn would lead to lubrication failure. 
But if you graph those curves you will see they define a polygon
within which the engine may be operated safely.  When you focus
on oil pressure alone you are only looking at one curve; at one
surface of the polygon.  Unfortunately, words are not the best
means of expressing some of the above; a sexy three dimensional
graphics program would offer an intuitive grasp of what I'm
driving at.

I think I would try to gather more quantified data before
deciding if there was a problem that had to be fixed.  I'm
curious as to oil temp vs pressure.  And I'd take a hard look at
that EMPI cooler's flow rate and the pressure drop across it. 
The Type IV's are very well engineered as a system; you may be
trying to gild the lily.

For my money, the Type IV is the best aircooled engine VW made. 
I just wish they were more widely available.  And not so heavy.

-Bob
