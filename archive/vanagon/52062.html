Subject: RE: Where can I rent a CO meter in East Bay (CA)

&gt;| bucks).  However a friend directed me to the local Heathkit (Zenith) =
&gt;| dealer who had a CO meter that you could build.  Yes, it takes a couple =
&gt;| of hours but I still have it and it.  It has always checked out against =
&gt;| all smog tests in CA and Utah where I now live.  It cost about $150.00 =
&gt;| but it is still a wise investment for EFI or Carbs (I use it to dial in =
&gt;| my Webers on my 2 Liter Type IIs)

	I remember reading somewhere that the voltage out of an O2 sensor
is directly related to the % CO coming out at the tail pipe and that
on a car equipped with an O2 sensor, you could jump the contact with
a digital multimeter to watch the CO level (maybe this was from the
archive, but I couldn't find it, otherwise it was from the Bentley FI and
Engine Management book which I do not have accessible at thye moment).
I remember the voltage across a Bosch Lamba sensor would be 10 times
smaller than the percent CO, so if you got a three wire CO sensor, a
digital multimeter, and a 12 volt power supply to both run the heater
circuit in the Lamba sensor and supply current for the sensor, you would
have a simple, portable CO meter...
