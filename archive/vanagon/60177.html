&gt; Subject: Re: VW club

&gt; When I wrote this I had not read the whole thread.  Is there a VW
&gt; sponsered VW Club?

I didn't read the whole thread either, but this question and your
previous question about discount for parts tie together.

The Volkswagen Club of America goes back to about '57 and does
keep close ties with VW.  The middle page of every issue of &quot;VW
Autoist&quot;, the VWCA bi-monthly newsletter, includes a listing ove
VW dealers which provide a discount on parts, labor and
accessories.  If I were to actually go to a VW dealer, the
closest &quot;Friend of the Club&quot; dealer is about 30 miles away.  It
offers 20% off of parts, 15% off of accessories, and 10% off of
labor for card-carrying VWCA members.

You can Email the VWCA at vwclub_at_aol_dot_com

There are many local chapters of VWCA and you can become a member
of the local chapter, get their newsletter and the VW Autoist
with the membership.
