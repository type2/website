Subject: Re: Question about 86 Synchro Weekender

&gt; &gt;86 SYNCRO VANAGON, 4 wheel drive, good cond in and out, am/fm cass, 
&gt;  cruise, &gt;Weekender Pkg, asking $3700. (860) 868-7226. Washington
&gt; 
&gt; My questions to the user community is:
&gt; What does the Weekender Package for the 86 van comprise of?
&gt; 	Can it sleep 4 people?
&gt; 	Does it include the pop top with room for 2 to bunk in?
&gt; 	Does the back seat recline into a bed?
&gt; 
&gt; Don't care about the complete Westfalia camper since the price is atractive.
&gt; 
Saw an '87 or so Weekender the other day - it had the same poptop as 
my Westy, but a full width folding rear seat, and a jump seat behind 
the driver. The owner had added a sink cabinet behind the passenger. 
I liked the idea of the full width rear seat, since we've found ours 
pretty tight when reading inside on a rainy night. The ability to 
carry two more people was nice also... (I starting having thoughts of 
a this as a second Vanagon someday.... :)

 Sounds like it's worth a look at that price.
