Speaking of which, I used to have some cooking guidelines which would allow 
for cooking in the engine compartment (then it was a big V8 engine).  I 
remember like a couple hours for a whole chicken, or baked potatoes, or foil 
dinners (corn, hamburger meat, carrots).  Does it get hot enough in the 
engine compartment of a bus, on the top of the block, to do this?  Anybody 
know, or tried it?
