Subject: Re: performance tires


&gt;Regarding tyres on a Porsche engine van, I recently read an article that
&gt;took your typical NA family slush bucket, and went from 14&quot; garden variety
&gt;tires to 16&quot; low profile performance tires of the same diameter, slightly
&gt;wider.
&gt;Even the authors of this performance oriented mag were totally stunned
&gt;at the dramatic improvement in performance,and handling. They were totally
&gt;blown away with the difference.

&gt;From my own experience I must agree. I own such a slush bucket--
a '66 Mustang. Owner's manual calls for 185-14 tires (radials didn't
exist in '66), and I shudder to think what the car must have been like
on them. When I got it in '92, it had some worn 185R14's on it, and
handling was somewhere between poor and dangerous. I put new 215/60R14s
on it, HR rated, and the improvement was surprising-- handling is now
up to the &quot;pretty good&quot; level. Or it would be if the d*mned thing could
stay aligned. Worn upper control arm pivot shafts, I think-- I rebuilt
everything else.


&gt;PS: Do Type II's slide, or roll first? IF roll, which tire lifts first? How
&gt;do
&gt;you tell? How soon before the second tire lifts, and how do you tell?;-)

I've wagged my '69 bus's tail a few times on gravel, and once in 50+mph
wind gusts in Colorado. There, it skidded without flipping. What it would
do in a sharp curve on a good day, though, I couldn't tell you.
