Subject: Free Vanagon floor mat

Vanatics,

I have a rubber floor mat for a Vanagon that I'm willing to give away.  It
fits the cener section of a Vanagon with the conventional forward-facing
2-passenger center seat.  I made it for my 87 Vanagon Syncro a couple years
ago out of rubber that was intended as a pickup truck bed-liner.  I recently
converted my Synco to have removable rear facing seats, and made a new floor
mat for the new arrangement.  Thus, I have no need for the old one.  It is
black and does not look great, but it will do a great job at protecting
carpet.  I can ship it out UPS if you'd like.  All you'd pay is the shipping
cost.
