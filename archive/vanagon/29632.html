&gt;btw what have people used to replace the little plastic
&gt;&quot;filters&quot; that cover over the idiot lights and give you
&gt;those pretty red lights etc.??  sorry for the lack of tecky
&gt;discription.

&gt;I was thinking of replacing mine with coloured acetate from
&gt;an art supply store but wanted to get other opinions.

When I reconditioned my speedo a few years ago, I pulled out
the faded, original &quot;filters&quot; and sprayed a coat of *clear*
color (like used for putting a &quot;candy color&quot; on plastic
models) on them.  Should last forever and gave a nice even
color.  The suggestion of magic marker may work OK as well.
I just don't know how long it would last.
