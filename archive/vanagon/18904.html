Well, thanks to all those who helped with my &quot;unintended four-wheel 
steering&quot; problem.  

It turns out that the main bolt which holds the reduction box to 
the swing arm in the middle was gone.  I was not aware that there was 
even one there until I was under there the other day checking the oil 
leak(s).

I have the bolt and plan on putting it back in as soon as I can get a 
jack under it to get some pressure off of the wheel.

Also: [F]riday stuff from Mikey!:

I get to go pick up my VW Emblem today!  It has been at the chrome 
shop for over a month!  What a crazy wait.  Why does it take them so 
long???  It was $25 to have chromed, and they did all the 
sandblasting to get the paint/rust off of it!  What prices are you 
guys encountering to get an emblem chromed?

I cleaned up the chrome for the bumpers (They are early '60's 
bumpers).  I used Brasso (Says &quot;Do not use w/ aluminum.&quot;  Hogwash!) 
and a brillo pad to get the old gunk off of them.  They look 
beautiful.  Now to re-attach them to the bumper and get that darn 
rubber back in.  (FWIW, I am selling these bumpers!)

BTW!  I am still in search for the a set of 50's blades w/chrome!  I 
wish I would have been able to go to SOTO to search for them... &lt;CRY&gt;

Bad apple car sightings:

Beautifully restored ~64 Double cab, even w/deluxe bumpers!
Midnight Blue Audi Cabrio
Black/Gray Mercedes Benz S600 - V12.  What a car...
~68 Benz 190 SL

Enough of my babble!
