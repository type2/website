Subject: starter relay,bars leaks,Newark Electronics

Sorry,guys,when I said any 12v relay would work I was just assuming I was
talking to fellow technicians. You do need a reasonably strong one(the Ghia
horn relay always worked fine, a radiator fan relay from a rabbit or
Vanagon should work fine).

I don't recommend bar's leaks for two reasons:1) you have a genuine problem
and are only patching it instead of repairing it properly.2) I don't know
about the Vanagon, but the Rabbit had very small passages in the radiator
and heater core, and I would be concerned about clogging them.

Newark Electronics has a fabulous catalog.
