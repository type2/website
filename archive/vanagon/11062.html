Subject: Re: Window tinting

I have a question on window tinting as well.  I bought my used '81
westy with the windows already tinted.  They all look fine, EXCEPT
for the rear hatch window, which has some scratches on it, plus
little bits of missing film, etc.  Will removing the existing
film there damage the rear-window defogger?  Is it made from
wires in the glass or conductive paint?  Should I try it myself
or leave it to professional?
