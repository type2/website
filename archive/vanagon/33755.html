&gt;I am considering the purchase of a 1995 Eurovan camper. 
&gt;When I called my insurance agent (Allstate) he quoted my
&gt;a rate from his auto insurance price list under Eurovan GL. 
&gt;
&gt;Apparently Allstate has different policies for autos vs. RVs. 
&gt;Although not apples to apples a rate he quoted me for a (non-Eurovan)
&gt;RV was significantly less. The way he put it is that RV
&gt;insurance is lower because they don't expect you to use your
&gt;RV nearly as often. 
&gt;
&gt;I'd be interested in knowing if other EV Camper owners are 
&gt;insuring their vehicles as RVs or autos?

Well, here in BC my Westy had to be insured as an RV.  From what they told
me I didn't have a choice.  Not sure if it would be cheaper or more
expensice to insure a 1978 van though.
