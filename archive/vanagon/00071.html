&gt;
&gt;&gt; I MAY have one that is in reasonable shape. I will dig around
&gt;&gt; in my glovebox of the immoble Bus (Experiencing FarFromMovin' now)
&gt;&gt; and see if that is what is in there. I believe it is there. It
&gt;&gt; may be stored in my archives in another state though, but I
&gt;&gt; will check.
&gt;
&gt;It would be very cool, I'd be happy to copy it and send the
&gt;orig back to you or whatever. Otherwise I will have o experiment
&gt;with all those knobs and levers for quite a while.
&gt;
I checked in there the other day while attempting to get my Explodo-Bus
to idle. The Owners manual seems in pretty good shape, with some water
stains on the bottom of about half the pages. It is even inside the
original plastic sleeve. The sleeve and some stamps show that it was
bought about 5 miles from where I now live, in Fairfax, VA, USA.
Pretty amazin' considering that the bus has been with my family
throughout the USA, Canada, Spain, Germany, and some other
unnammed parts of Europe. Around the world (A couple of times,
according to the odometer) and right back to the original shipping 
point!
