Subject: (U) 87 Camper Overheating

I have an 87 camper which suddenly started to indicate that the engine temp was
too high a few weeks ago. The radiator fan was not coming on yet the temp gauge
indicated that the engine was very hot (the temp light was flashing also).
Odd thing though, the first time this happened, I pulled over pronto but the
engine did not seen overly hot...in fact it seemed normal. I checked the temp
switch and it worked fine, radiator fan worked also when the switch was closed.
Problem seemed to be pointing to a bad/intermitent temp sensor back on the
engine. I bought a new one and was about to put it in when the problem just as
suddenly disappeared and has not occurred since. Anyone experience a similar
problem?
