Subject: Steve Johnson is Alive and Well (really!)

Hi list,

Just thought I'd post a note and say that I have a confirmed sighting of Steve
Johnson... he IS a real person behind that vanagon email!

Steve and his wife Linda are in the middle of their 2-week trip through Idaho 
and Oregon and are having a good time.  They stopped by last night for burgers
and beer.  We had a good time talking, Linda even managed to avoid looking
bored when Steve and I lapsed off into VW-ese! :)  I sent them on their way 
this morning in their nice `91 Westphalia (I want one too!).  Steve will, no
doubt, post a trip summary when he gets back (next week I think?).

OK, now that we know Steve is real, who's to say that I'm real?  Hehheh, maybe
Steve and I are both fictitious...  Maybe we ALL ARE!! Maybe Joel's the only
real one on this list!!  Oh no! an existential crisis! (not to mention a
Vanagon-list calamity...)

John Ritchie (really!)
and Bobo, the `74 bus (really?)
