Subject: Intermittent starting problem, part II,


Since I have taken my 87 syncro to the dealer, the weather has warmed and 
since the problem (no starting with turn of key, no crank either) seems to 
be linked to cold weather, they have not been able to duplicate the problem. 


I called the dealer with the list suggestion for replacing the solenoid and 
he came back with an estimate for $372.  He also doesn't believe in just 
replacing the solenoid, so he gave me an estimate to replace the starter: 
 $542 which includes 12mo/12,000mi warranty.

Is nothing reasonably priced or simple?

Has anyone from the list had this service done or bought the parts and 
replace it themselves?
If so is the above sane?

later,

relax and spin
