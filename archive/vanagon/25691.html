Subject: re: Asheville NC Dealer, and waving back

Hey Dave,

You're not the only EV owner that waves at *every* split, loaf and vanagon,
with hardly any waves back.  I don't think half of them even know  what 
they're driving 8^)

C'mon, start waving back.  I've got my whole family trained and they're
going to get discouraged soon...
