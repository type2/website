So Scott A. Harvey says:
&gt; 
&gt; Will anyone be going on Thurs.?  I have both thurs &amp; fri. off and this is a 
&gt; long enough trip for me (Orange County) that leaving on fri. wouldn't leave 
&gt; much daylight.  I'd rather leave late morning instead of early a.m.
&gt; Also, anyone up for caravaning? or meeting somewhere along the way?
&gt;  

Linda and I will be leaving Thursday night (sorry Scott).  We'll probably 
drive up to Tahoe and then turn south to connect up to 395 and camp some-
where along that way.  I plan on getting up fairly early and then arriving
at the camp sites around noon.
