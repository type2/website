Subject:  message for david swarze

sorry to post this to the list, but it is time sensitive and i couldn't get a
message to david for some reason.

david:
could you please send me the # of the guy with the bus at the OR/CA
border area.  my brother will be passing through that area (by the coast)
within the next couple of days with my adventurewagen, and if it
worked out, i wouldn't mind having him at least salvaging the fridge and
stove, if they are comparable to yours.  (also, where exactly is the guy
at?)

thanks- and sorry about your excellent page being displaced (good thing
i checked it out thoroughly before)-glad you had a good trip
