I am in need of one very elusive oil cooler part for my '71 bus.  I 
have the heavy on how to make one but I am making one last attempt to 
locate the original.  I think the dreaded PO did me in once again.

So anyway, I took a long lunch today.  I went to the hardware store 
and was unimpressed with their tin stock.  I headed over the local VW 
flaps.  They let me root around their parts some.  No luck. 
They said I could come back later when I wasn't in my librarian 
outfit.  I might do that.  I was four or five miles from work already,
on my bike, so I headed further north of town to the import car 
salvage place.  I had never been there.  They said they didn't have 
but a few type II's anymore.  One '78 and some vanagons.  The rest 
ended up like that one, he said, pointing to a three picture series of 
one getting crushed!  The bastards took pictures!  So I asked if there
were any bugs left.  A couple he said.  I took off on my bike.  The 
bugs weren't hard to find in the sea of volvos and the like.  Only one
had it's motor left.  Unfortunantly I only had a swiss army knife on 
me.  I will have to go back on saturday.  I think you can get the oil 
cooler out without pulling the engine.  I am hoping you can.  Somebody
tell me if you can't and I won't waste my time.

So I wondered over to the '78 bus thinking there might be something in 
there.  Not much.  Oh, I need a headlight switch.  I liberated that.  
Hope it works in the '71.  Then, back in the corner I spied a split 
bus.  It was in waist high weeds and full of hub caps and wasps.  Not 
much left of it either.  Nice to see though.  I have only seen about 
four of these in the flesh.  We like our salt out here.  :(  I guess 
that is about all.  Just thought I would tell somebody.  Wow, I had 
better eat my lunch now before it is time to go home.  Jim
