Thom,

It's simple to mail to the list, just address your email to

vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu

and write away!

As far as the universal O2's go, I've got one in my van and it's been
just fine for 6 months.  All you need is a pair of wire
cutters/strippers, and electrical tape.  Fit in the exhaust pipe
perfect, didn't even use anti-seize or such.  The little metal protector
cover doesn't fit on it, but oh well, I don't travel on gravel roads
much anyway.  It cost me about $40, I think.  The cheapest that I could
find the 'right' one was $120 or thereabouts.  Even if you're not sure
that this is a problem, if yours is old, a new one will probably improve
fuel consumption if nothing else.

Since wiggling the wires will sometimes help, I'd really suggest
checking the resistance on all of them.  One with an internal break may
be causing your problems.  Someone recently posted that the harness is
WAY expensive, but you may be able to cut-n-splice to fix the offending
wire. (At least, I think these were the wires they were talking
about--didn't pay close attention).

By the by, the O2 light is meaningless.  All it means is that it's been
over 60K miles since the light was reset.  If you want to make it go
off, there is a small reset button.  Some say it's behind the spedometer
in the dash area, others say by the front driver's wheel hub on the
spedo cable.  I haven't had to find it myself yet, so I'm not sure of
it's exact location.  But if you post to the list with you're year
model, somebody will tell you exactly where it is.

Good luck,
Tonya
