Subject: Electronic ignition

Dear Martha and other VW enthusiasts,


I am currently running my VW on LPG (propane gas) and am considering
fitting an electronic ignition to get a better spark.
Who has any experience with aftermarket electronic ignitions?
Should I buy a &quot;spark-enhancer&quot; - which does not do away with contact
breaker points and condenser - or should I fit one of the more elaborate
designs?
Please let me know about your own experiences.
Thanks in advance,

Hanno Spoelstra,
Delft, the Netherlands.
(Currently driving a 1300 cc '71 Bug on daily basis, looking for a VW
181.)
