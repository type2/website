I almost forgot about this.  That rod that runs from the thermostat up
between cylinders number one and two, I can't get out.  Obviously I am
missing something here, what is it?  I just ended up disconnecting the
rod from the top end to get the fan housing off.  Also, what is the 
life of that thermostat?  Can one tell when it is over?  Thanks, Jim
