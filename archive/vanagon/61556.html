Subject: Re: Dead Ly Serious Fun With Gasoline

Adding to this thread, I had an experience with a plastic jerry can that
was equipped with a foam filter in the end of the pour spout that would
cause the same static/fire prob as a plastic bed liner would. While
pouring into a tank, a popping noise would occur, similiar to a spark
plug wire shorting, and the second time this occured, a flame acutually
occured. Pretty scarry at first but we had the ubuquitous extingusher
handy and then figured out the cause. The solution was to eliminate the
filter by pulling it out of the spout. I also notified the manufacturor
who was most interested. Kit 85 Westy GL
