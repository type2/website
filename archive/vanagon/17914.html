Subject:      FFF The song goes ever onward: look out, folks, he's on a roll...


another verse, just like the ferse:

A fellow down Atlanta way has lost his A/C pump,
And cannot find the one he needs to cure his &quot;comfort slump.&quot;
So now he rides with windows down, and breathes the lovely air
Of all those MARTA buses spewing diesel everywhere!

&lt;chorus&gt;
