Subject:      Driver side flat mirror suggestion

Sorry can't stop laughing...Im doing the samn thing!
I screwed up, go to close to my schoolbus's crossview mirror and hit
my Vanagon mirror (that was perfect and didn't fold over!) and
cracked it to hell. Bought replacement _at_ WCM, and it sucks! It's
looks perfect BUT the bloody thing folds over!!!!
Before I got the new one, I had to super glue the old one in place...

so that's about the only thing I can advise. Adjust it correctly(I
always try to see about 1&quot; of the van; excellent guideline for
schoolbusses go for cars too, plus ya need that vehicle reference..
oh
god Im blabbing on..I need to get back to work!) and super glue (GEL
is better!) around the ball part, it should work. I haven't done it,
cause I need to get some glue!  It worked with the old broke mirror
anyways.
