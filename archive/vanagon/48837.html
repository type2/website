A  little local shopping has yielded the following prices on CV 
joints/axles:
VW Dealer - Axle complete, new parts, $747 each side (yikes)
(and they wonder why we don't go there!)
Brands refer to CV's not axles.

New Moog $99.99 ea per side whole axle exchange
New MPR $99.75 ea per side whole axle exchange

New Lobro $69.95 ea CV plus $15 boot kit

One FLAPS says that CV mfg sells axles cheap to keep 
people from taking apart CV joints.
So the question is, anyone have experience with these brands?
I can put CV's on my own axles but at twice the price of a 
whole, already assembled axle, WHY SHOULD I? (other than the Muir 
philosophy of getting close to one's transportation . . . )
