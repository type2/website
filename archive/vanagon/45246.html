Subject: Re: 83 pop-top seal

Mike, 

I know pop-top seals can be had, or you can be had, depending on how you
look at it , for alot less then 533. 

Don't know set-up on '83, but on my '78 I removed the seal and then cleaned
out all the crimping metal and other none rubber junk that was in there,
spread open the seal and hosed it out until it was clean let it dry, then
patched up the bad spots with black silicone caulk, smoothing and blending
it in before it set. I then rubbed on a whole bunch of rubber conditioner on
the outside careful not to get any in the split. Ithen just glued that baby
up there with clear silicone caulk. Its been 4 yrs and it's still hangin in
there. Total cost? not much
