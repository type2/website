Subject: Re: Misc Vanagon parts for sale

Trying to keep alive a 87 Vanagon with a shoe string budget.
I need the following items and wonder if you could help..

1. idle control unit (made by VDO VW Part# 251 907 393B, item located at the
rear     passenger side right behind the turn singal lens assembly)
2. rear bumper w/both end caps
3. rear hatch door w/glass  
4. the three pieces plastic conduit that channel the A/C cold air from the
rear to the front    (the pieces are hanging on the roof with air outlets on
both side and run from rear of       the van to the front right at the
center.)

If you have the above items please let me know. Please also itemize the
price.
By the way, where is your 88 Vanagon located.

Thanks.
