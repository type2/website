In a message dated 96-07-18 20:15:03 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; When workin on a van that had a similar problem(bled it, put in new
 thermostat) but still 
 ran hot. The problem in this cas was that there was a crack inside the
 radiator that basically
 let the water out of the radiator as fast as it came in. The water never got
 to the side of the
 radiator with the temp sensor. One way to check this is to remove the grill
 and feel the 
 radiator on both the passenger and driver side. If it doesn't feel as hot on
 the drivers side 
 as it is on the passenger side either it may be cracked or clogged.
  &gt;&gt;
So you are the overheating pro  Ha Ha!.
