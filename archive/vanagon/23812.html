Subject: Boat-top Camper?

Went out to this &quot;good-ol-boy's&quot; place  day before yesterday to look at the
remainder of his vw stuff before he went off gold prospecting.. Most of the
residual was just that residual, and other than a nice &quot;middle bench seat&quot; for
my Deluxe, and a box of alternators the trip is just a memory.

EXCEPT.... I almost forgot..The guy had a bunch of pop-tops offa scrapped
buses. Most were later 70's full length Westie notch tops, but he had a few
small pre 68 pop-tops. Off in the corner of his yard I saw a skiff (small flat
bottomed boat) that sat off the ground about two feet on what appeared to be
the same frame &quot;X brace&quot; as the small westie pop-up. I could still see a bit of
orange canvas protruding from the top of the side farthest away from me. &quot;What's
that?&quot; I asked.. &quot;That's a boat top for an old VW camper, Son!&quot; he say's...&quot;Fit
right on that 67 you got from Jimmy Joe!&quot;  I looked a little harder at it and it
did appear to be Volkswagon-like with most if not all the hardware intact. As it
turned out the canvas is complete, just tucked up under the boat. The Boat is
fiberglass, looks like the same construction/quality as the standard westie pop-
top. I'd think it would need a bit of side wall reinforcement as it seemed a bit
too flexible.  I admit I'm curious, but want to find more info on it before I
buy it. Know anything about this option?
