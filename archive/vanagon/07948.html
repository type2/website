&gt;&gt; Having owned a few Fiats, however, I must say I have really enjoyed them... 
&gt;&gt; They were always a joy to drive, and too easy to get yourself killed in. 
&gt;&gt; Later in life, I decided to separate the two:  I bought a 73 VW bus for 
&gt;&gt; 'comfortable' transpotation, and a Kawasaki 550 gpZ for the thrill... 
&gt;
&gt; Snap, almost. I got a 70 bus for the take it easy and a Kawasaki GPz 550
&gt; for the ohmygosh sessions. Have many others on the list gone for the
&gt; bus/bike combination? 

Well, almost.  A '72 911 Targa offset by a '56 kombi :)
