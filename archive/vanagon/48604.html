Subject: 1996 Westy's

Hi Everyone.  I got some new brochures of the new Eurovan Westy's 
from an aquaintance in The Netherlands.  New front end, new dash, and 
interesting models.  I only have 4 pictures on my page (click on the 
image to get a big one).  I can scan some images of the interiors if 
people are interested.  

Enjoy them at http://www.bcit.bc_dot_ca/~hyates/vw1.htm

Harry.
