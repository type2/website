          check the big connector to the dash instruments ... the #14 pin 
          is the ground connection, and if it's dirty or not making good 
          connection, you can get all sorts of strange lighting behavior.
     
     reminded me that this applies to all sorts of weird lighting problems. 
      Ever notice a car whose tail lights go out when the turnsignal 
     flashes?  Bad ground on the tail light housing.
