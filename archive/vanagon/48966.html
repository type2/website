Subject: Stumble stumble.....stall?  Humph!?

Heres a test for all the vanagon gurus (of which I'm not one).  I have
an 84 Westfalia that has developed a habit of a rough idle, more of a
miss really, and occasionally stalls while idling.  This is easily
repeatable if I have all the electrical things and A/C going.  Any
ideas?
