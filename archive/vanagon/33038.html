Subject: RE: odd brick

MIchael asks...

&gt;Driving home, I noticed a '70s-era brick with what looked to be almost a
&gt;radiator along the front -- I guessed it was some kind of ventilation unit,
&gt;it looked very good, like it had come from the factory that way -- anyone
&gt;have any guesses as to what it was..?

While in Mexico City on business I have seen vans, 72-79 style tho apparently 
new, all over the place with what looks like a radiator up front,usually 
black, tho I never got a chance to inspect one up close. Maybe it was of 
Mexican manufacture
