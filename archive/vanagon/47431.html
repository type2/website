Subject: Re: upgrading 86-up headlights

I have tried a pair of 80w/100w bulbs from JCW in my my 87 and while there is
improvement it wasn't much. I have some 100w/165w bulbs in my Bronco and they
are great, they really get attention from oncoming traffic, unfortunately I
have only seen them in the H-4 bulbs. If anybody can find something similar
in a 9004 bulb I'd love to hear it.
