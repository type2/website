&gt;     So it looks like people are going to start posting replys to 
&gt;     anything???? 
&gt;     
&gt;     Even if they have nothin' to say????  
&gt;     
&gt;     Just to get to the top of the list?????  
&gt;     
&gt;     Is being on top that prestigious????  
&gt;     
&gt;     Can I construct a message purely out of interrogative 
&gt;     sentences????
&gt;     
&gt;     How many question marks after a sentence should I put in????
