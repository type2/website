That might present a problem in the future...

&gt;     So I don't have anything to go on besides the VIN #  which I found
&gt; stamped in another place.  (20-029 105)  

&gt; white.  Does anyone know the actual names for these colors?   Also, my
&gt; speedometer goes up to 80km.  Not mph.  

Yahoo!  Good score!

&gt; So does this mean that it came from
&gt; Europe?  Canada?    One more thing, the headlights look like they take
&gt; halogen type bulbs and not the sealed beem type.  Is this odd?

Thats normal for early busses.
