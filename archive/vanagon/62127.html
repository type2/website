Subject: VW show info (OHIO)

If anyone's interested, I'm trying to figure out who is going to be at the
G.A.S.S. show in Columbania, Oh next weekend. I've compiled a list of who's
going to be there and when, that I know of, it's listed below. First, the
listing of show info from the G.A.S.S. site....

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 July 4-6 (Sat-Sun), Columbiana, OH - GASS Buckeye German Jubilee;
VW/Porsche 
show, swap, and campout. Free show and $1 camping fee goes to Salvation
Army. 
Bike mission auction of donated parts and collectibles (Sat). Wkend. long
swap space 
$25. Call Troy Heitzenreiter (216)332-1865. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm going to be there all day Sunday.

Erik O (87 Syncro Westy) Sunday
Eric Z (86 Syncro) Sunday
Neil O (74 Westy) Saturday  [I'm trying to get him to change days]
Mike M (70's Westy) Sunday
Mark K (91 Carrat) Sunday  [you gota see this van, it's the salvage rebuild
              
                            from Flordia talked about on the list lately]
Tony M &amp; friends  ?????
Susan S (88' Westy) Sunday

That's all I know of right now. If you're in the area let someone know and
stop by. The N.E. Ohio area is not that big on VW vans, so this is one of
the few important events of the year for us. Tony M mentioned something
about getting a little section together at the show for listmembers.
