Subject: Parts Inquiries - Your Location Please!

Fellow listees -

I really appreciate and enjoy answering the dozens of inquires I go though
every LATE night I can.  However, it would be greatly appreciated if the
inquirers would please give me their ZIP code to determine freight costs.
 Don't need the address, city or state, just the ZIP.  Over 91% of the
inquiries asking how much freight is for the whats-it fail to give a location
etc., so it's very hard to be even semi-accurate.

Some items can be difficult because of the long lists of items people are
interested in and can sometimes result in multiple boxes.  Case in point:
 Recently had a V&amp;L'er ask about engine rebuilding parts for his 1.9,
including Piston/Cylinder Set, gaskets, bearings, etc.  This would
necessitate pre-packing to determine the weights, especially since P/C's have
to go into a separate box to avoid damaging the other stuff.  This can take
an extra day to determine the shipping.  Most other stuff I can figure the
freight as I have the UPS Charts next to the machine here.  But he didn't
tell me where in the country (or world) he was.  It's hard to be fair and
close about shipping charges, because we certainly don't want to appear to be
out of line when quoting this.

Also, try to remember that all the E-Mail support is done here at home and
not at the office because of time constraints and our 'puter system is not
set up for E-Mail down there YET.  It's a simple matter of dialing into the
server at the office from home and keeping the office system going in a
window so I can refer to parts at a moments notice to answer all of the
requests in the other E-Mail window (off-line of course).

I'm sure Ron Salmon and other commercial listees would certainly appreciate
this as well.  We really want to help and your help is greatly appreciated on
this end of the bandwith.

Thanks for your support :)
