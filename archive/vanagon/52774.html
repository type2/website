At least it wasn't impailed on the front grill or stuck in the windshield
with the driver laying dead.  Too many deer and not enough hunters I say.
I've seen far too many accidents in N.E. P.A. from the little corn
munchers to care how many get killed during hunting season.  By the way,
it was all of the development in this country that forced the deer into
tighter home ranges which in turn caused them to over-populate.  Keep
killin them.(P.S. this is not meant to be a flame,but I have had with all
animal rights people.)
