Subject: Re: VW's new Web pages

Just tried it, but the graphic on the front page, which seems to be a
clickable image only takes me to itself. Huh? nice picture, but don't have
time to hang out there all day.

&gt;Volkswagen Motors To The Web
&gt;
&gt;Volkswagen America has established a World Wide Web site to service
&gt;existing and potential customers. Volkswagen says it had tried to be
&gt;different from other auto-maker sites which it says are &quot;mostly text
&gt;based, on-line brochures.&quot; The VW home page features a road map, which
&gt;acts as the home page, navigating the user to various general subject
&gt;sites. One area, &quot;Shakedown Street,&quot; takes the user down a road built
&gt;in memory of late Grateful Dead member Jerry Garcia.
