Subject: Re: 87 Vanagon FS or Part-out? Weekender

Anyone know what's need to make that jump seat fit in the middle 
section of my Westy, that is, behind the passenger seat? Is it 
similar to the rare factory 5th seat found in Westy's?

&gt;   I'm offering a Vanagon to you all to see if it gets sold in ONE piece, or
&gt; Parted-out?
&gt; 
&gt;   This is a Weekender, I think you call it, rear Jump seats with folding out
&gt; table.
&gt; 
&gt;   The engine is blown, Head-gaskets at least.   .
&gt;   Steering rack is leaky, 
&gt;   Bad rear tires
&gt;   No Rear Bumper
&gt;   Minimal body damage
&gt;   Cracked tailight lens
&gt;   Bad hatch struts
&gt; 
&gt;   There is only ONE of the rear facing Jump seats(The left side one).  Auto
&gt; trans.  Alloy Wheels.
&gt; 
&gt;   Please respond to my Volks-motorsports E-mail address!!!

&gt;   I'm going to put together a list of people that want parts, and I'm going
&gt; to put together a list of the people that might want it Whole!
