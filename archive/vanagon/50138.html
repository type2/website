Them's fightin' words varmint.....


&gt;&gt;    GEEk.... This has got to be some project for school! Anyone in school
&gt;&gt;             is a GEEK!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;                                               ERIC 
&gt;You're right. It is a project for school. It's an industrial validation 
&gt;test station that VW will be using in their plant. I hope that makes you 
&gt;feel more secure.
&gt;
&gt;What is this crap?? Eric, if you're 14 years old I can understand this, 
&gt;but you're obviously not. I dont care who you are or what you do, but 
&gt;keep this crap off the list.


Looks like someones a bit sensitive about geekdom, good shot Eric :)

If you took Erics comment really seriously, lighten up, he's outnumbered
millions to one.

If you want the modulus for steel in order to assess the influence of the
steel studs upon the elastic elongation/compression of the waterjacket
assembly when torqued and need the EXACT value I can see you are going to
make a mountain out of nothing.  Have you got the EXACT thermal coefficients
of expansion for the jacket alloy, and the case too, and have you worked out
the temperature gradients throughout the jacket/case at all operating
conditions so you can accurately assess the thermal growth that will occur?
Do you have the modulus for the thick head gasket, and Poissons ratio for
it?  How about for an aged and stiffened up gasket? A cold gasket?

 I wouldn't even worry about Youngs modulus until some of that stuff is
answered.  Have you 'built' a numerical/FEM model of this system.  ANSYS
will do thermal/heat transfer cases, surely VW can provide the EXACT
geometry of the components from their CAD drawings?  Have you done a
parametric study to see what the influence of a few percent error in Youngs
modulus will do to the outcome? Steel is steel, or ask VW then go get Marks
handbook or similar and look it up.

   As a graduate of Waterloo University, Canadas top engineering school,  I
will be very interested to see what U of T and VW can do when teamed up to
work on a discontinued engine that was a disaster on the VW design boards,
thanks to short sighted engineering in the first place.  It's too late to
recover, don't VW realize that?  Since they refused to fix any of the three
(3) bad engines I've had, f*ck'em!

Finally, don't bite the hand that feeds you, lest it wring your (pencil)
neck!  More expertise on this list than you will find at an engine rebuild
plant. Obviously no enginerring since you wouldn't be asking us for that
data, right?!!. Finally, since 9T6 stands for the year of your intended
graduation from UofT, presumably LAST April, does the +P  stand for 'plus
Plan' where you keep going and going and going.....  ;&gt;.

bye, tim smith
