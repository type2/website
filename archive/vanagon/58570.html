Subject: POP TOP Conversion

The Westphalia top came out of an 86 or newer (I remember it had square 
headlights) crashed van.  The only hole that was needed on my 87 was 
from behind the front seats to about where the rear seat starts (when 
down flat) by the width of the van.  The roof is really set up well for 
having the hole cut...just remember the wiring.  There is a rear plywood 
section that was put on top of my existing roof (maybe this is 
integrated into the roof on a real factory job).  No holes were made for 
this.  The flip over section that completes the upstairs bed had to be 
raised about an 1.5&quot; above where it was originally designed to sit 
using some simple wooden spacers.  I like that though because I can 
leave food in my kitchen shelf when the bed is down.  So I think the 
whole unit sits up higher but the bed has enough clearance when it is 
flipped in its stowed position and the top is down.

If I had a digital camera I could post pictures....
