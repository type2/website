Subject: To Rebuild or To Buy a New Engine?

hey now,

well, while i won't know completely how bad Rumba's engine is hurt until we
pull the engine, my shadetree mechanic sean is pretty sure it's the heads.
maybe a cylinder? anyways, i figuring on the worst case scenario here.
should i go for a totally new engine or do a rebuild? opinions? i know i can
get a 165 horsepower engine for it...but i'd like to do it stock.

i'm not going to do the rebuild if it comes to that, my friend sean is. but i'm
gonna be right there learning/helping so i can next time. i don't feel
comfortable and don't have the $$$ or place to do it myself. but i'm gonna
learn from him so i guess that's okay.

one good thing about this is when i told amanda (my fiancee as of this past
weekend) she got real quiet and i thought i heard her sniffle (i was on the
phone). i told her i didn't know what i was going to do with my van. she
said, we should save up money and get our van fixed. i said our? we? she said
something to the effect, yeah, i love that van too, we can both save money and
get it fixed faster! ;-) for richer for poorer! she wanted to drive it this
weekend but i haven't let anyone else drive it yet...hehehe. maybe i should
like get a prenuptial agreement that in case we get divorced, i keep the van!
:P anyways, i hope to be on the road by july again. hopefully.
