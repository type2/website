&lt;&lt;I really like the look of the 89-91 Vanagons with the 'rocker panels'.  &gt;&gt;

I saw a Vanagon today on a for sale lot with rocker panels.  It didn't have
the little Wolfsburg Edition seal (like on my old '89) and wasn't a Carat.
 It was a GL, and I could tell by the 7 headrests visible, that it had the
traditional seating arrangement like my 93 EV GL.

My old '89 Wolfsburg had rocker panels, and it was my understanding that only
Wolfsburgs and Carats were available with these trim pieces.  When did the GL
get them?  Also, when I bought my Vanagon they were selling both Carats and
Wolfsburgs that were practically the same model.  What was the difference?  I
bought the Wolfsburg because I was able to special order it with different
options than the standard ones had and that was the only reason I got it
instead of a Carat.  What is the difference?
