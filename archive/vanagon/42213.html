Subject: My Own Sliding Door Problems

I had a sliding door problem of sorts myself today.  The lock mechanism on my 
door has been tough to unlatch lately.  I think this may be because the door 
was hanging a bit too low.  I noticed that the bracket on the inside front of 
the door seems to be adjustable up or down.

Anyway when I yanked on the door to open it, the inside roller slipped out 
(see why I think it was hanging too low) and the door almost leaned out and 
smacked me on the head.  We were in the IGA parking lot with few tools but 
managed to remove the inside roller and put the door back on.

I'll be taking a look at it tomorrow to see if I can get it working 
properly/reliably before the long weekend.  It makes it very hard to take our 
surfboards on and off the roof rack if I can't stand in the doorway.
