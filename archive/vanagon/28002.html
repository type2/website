&gt; the initial 2 means it's a type 2 - transporter
&gt; the second number is the model -
&gt;      model  21 is the delivery van  (no windows on sides, no seats in back,
&gt; one tone paint)
&gt;      model  22  is the Microbus  (headliner,  3 windows on sides,  interior
&gt; panels, rear and middle seats, two tone paint)
&gt;      model  23  is the Kombi  (3 windows on sides,  no interior panels or
&gt; headliner,  rear seat standard)  These were made into Westy campers
&gt;       model  24  is  the Microbus Deluxe  (4 windows on sides, trim on
&gt; beltline &amp;bumpers, more shiny trinkets, sometimes w/ sunroof &amp; skylight
&gt; windows)
&gt;       model  26  is the pick-up and double cab pick-up
&gt;       model  27   is the ambulance
&gt;       model  28  is the  walk through front seat Microbus

Not to be difficult, but my '66 walk-through sunroof deluxe was VIN 256
