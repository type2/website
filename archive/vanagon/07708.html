&gt;&gt;replace them is $350), but the fuel lines need replacing ($375) and the
&gt;&gt;brake rotors need replacing (I'm not sure how much this is going to run

VW dealer will take $150+ each. You also need a seal for each rotor. So it will
be around $165 each rotor.

&gt;&gt;He mentioned a few things that are just expensive because VW parts are such
&gt;&gt;a rip-off.  Does anyone think I would have much luck getting the following
&gt;&gt;things from a junkyard?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Driver's side window regulator
&gt;&gt;Sliding door locking mechanism
&gt;&gt;replacment muffler (can we replace the muffer ourselves or is this a pro job?)

I took my muffler off once just recently. I think it can be done by yourself.
