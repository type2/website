&gt;Along this thread, perhaps I could get a few opinions from the list.  I've
&gt;been saving my money for five years now, hoping to get a VW Camper.  I'm
&gt;currently trying to decide whether I want to go cheap and look for a used
&gt;camper in great condition, or be patient and await to see what '96 brings.
&gt;Though I think that the older busses are beautiful, I'm not a mechanic, so I
&gt;think I will shy away from buying one of those.  I'd prefer something that
&gt;doesn't require lots of technical maintenance.
&gt;
&gt;If y'all had $30,000 to spend, what camper would get get?  A late-model
&gt;syncro?  A late-model non-syncro?  An earlier camper? Or should I wait?

well ... if you are NOT planning on working on it yourself, my opinion would
be that you'd want to get an air-cooled. why? cause there are more Bubbas out
there that can/will work on them ... i've had folks just tell me flatly that
they will NOT work on my water-cooled bus. my only other choice is dealers. :(
also: there seems to be much more &quot;stuff&quot; available for the older air-cools.

waiting has never appealed to me. :)

$30,000 to spend. hmmmm. i think i might get TWO 1980-1983 air-cooled campers,
and save the rest of the money for trips and repairs and &quot;personalizing&quot; the
buses. why two? well ... i don't know. just seems like a good idea.

for the cheapest, less-maintenance-required bus, i think these 1980-1983
would be your choice. unless you happen to like the bread-loaf style better,
in which case i would suggest the 78-79 years. why? mostly because of the
the hydraulic valves (so you don't have to adjust the valves every other
month), and the larger engine (so you can actually keep up with most of the
traffic).

i'm of the opinion (and all the Eurovans will hate me for this) that the
Eurovan (latest model) is no better than the water-cooled vanagons, as far
as maintenance is concerned. by that i mean that the owner is not gonna be
able to do much (so you are back to the dealer), and the dealer isn't selling
enough to make him want to train mechanics to work on them. while the Quality
of the Eurovan might be &quot;better&quot; than the vanagons (and that, i think, is
arguable), you've still got all those water-cooling parts and pumps and belts
and such. and coolant to be flushed and changed, etc. which (to me, being of
the old old school of vw advertising) is more things to worry about.

now, i happen to like my 88 water-cooled BETTER than my old 80 air-cooled,
but it's a personal preference thing ... quiet, real heat, better sliding
door. stuff like that.

what i would suggest you do is to take some of the money and perhaps RENT
one of each of the ones you want to consider. try out a Eurovan camper and
then a vanagon camper and then maybe a 78-79 camper. see which one YOU like
the most. you might surprise yourself. :)
