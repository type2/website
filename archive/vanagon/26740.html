On my US van the headlight switch is to the right of the steering
wheel and the wiper switch is to the left.  I don't know if it
was reversed in RHD, though.

&gt; Dear all,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;   I started to fit the wiring in my '62 at the weekend, this is the last thing i 
&gt;  have to do before it will be on the road,  and i ran into the problem of, on the
&gt;  dash there is two knobs one either side of the steering wheel one operates the 
&gt;  headlights the other one the windscreen wipers, which side does each one go as
&gt;  they were not fitted when i bought the van.
