Subject: Loud valve noise on startup



This morning I fired up my 84 and was assailed by very loud valve
noise.  I presume that a lifter is sticking as this has happened a couple
of times before and it usualy goes away after a few miles as it did
this morning.  My question is 

1.  Should I just ignore it until it happens 
again and does not go away (can it do any damage)? 

2. Has anyone had experience of cleaning the lifters and if so could they
give me some first hand info (are they similar to the air cooled?)?

3.Can hydraulic lifters be adjusted?

4. Would using lighter synthetic oil help the problem?

Thanks
