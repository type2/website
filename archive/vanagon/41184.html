Subject: bike racks

Hey everyone!
I posted a message yesterday asking about a bike rack for my syncro.  I got
a couple responses, but would appreciate any more advice there is out
there.
Does anyone have a roof mount rack on their vanagon?  Would you recommend
it?  Specifically, any clearance problems? (other than parking garages and
burger king drive thru), noise or drag??, trouble throwing your bikes up
there?
I know there's other types out there, and am open to suggestions (the two I
got already were pretty good)!  One particular concern is the ability to
lock it, as the two bikes are worth more than the van, and i'd rather not
have to sleep with them if we decide to camp.
And again, if anyone has one for sale, let me know.
Thank you very much!!

HE WHO LAUGHS  LASTS
