Subject: bleeding coolant

I just parked my van on a slight hill and then drove it onto ramps.  They 
were about $20 from Target and are very well made.  I do worry that I 
didn't get it high enough, but right now I'm out of luck because the 
entire alley and most of the streets are just ice and I wouldn't be able 
to get onto the ramps or lift with a jack at this point.
