Subject: Re[2]: Request Help On Antenna Installation

&gt;Stick the new ant thru it, have someone ready on the outside to hold it 
&gt;in plaace.
&gt;thread the coaxial thru some out of the way route back to the radio.
&gt;You're done.

One tip here that saved me some grief. Since the new antenna comes with a cord, 
you can use the old cord as a guide to get this new cord routed to the radio.

First off, do not unhook the old cord from the back of the radio. As you remove 
the old antenna from the front of the bus, cut its cord as close as possible to 
where it attaches to the antenna. Then carefully tape the radio end of the new 
antenna cord to where you just cut the old cord. Make the junction as smooth as 
possible because you are going to be snaking it through the dash.

Now go to where the old cord attaches to the radio, detach it, and gently pull 
the old and new cords towards you through the dash. You may have to stop &amp; 
wiggle at some points to get the tape joint through but it went pretty easily 
for me. Now when the the joint between the new and old cords appears, remove the 
tape and simply connect the new cord to the back of the radio.

It helps to have someone on the outside of the bus feeding the new antenna cord 
into the hole.
