Subject: Re: aerodynamics (Seriously...)

In a message dated 96-04-30 22:49:48 EDT, you write:

&gt;
&gt;would puting an airdam over the back door of the vanagon (like the ones that
&gt;ford and chevy put over the hatches of thier '70s station wagons) help the
&gt;vanagon's aerodynamics or woud it just look dumb.

It would hinder aerodynamics.  But then again the function of these devices
is not to improve aerodynamics, but to deflect air down across the rear
window helping to keep it cleaner.
