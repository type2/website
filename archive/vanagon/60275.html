Subject: Vanagon cartoon 

        Before I left for work today I was watching a morning cartoon called
&quot;Gargoyles&quot;, in which, during a fight scene, the good guys were hiding
behind what looked to be an attempt at a illustration of a red Vanagon
Transporter. It was the same shape, had the round headlights, and no room
for an engine in the front. 
        Unfortunately the good guys didnt last long behind it since the some
female Gargoyle with a huge laser gun started shooting holes right through
the van, and then turned the weapon to &quot;Obliterate&quot; and blew the van to peices.
        It's actually not a bad show.....Jonathan Frakes, and the chick who
played Deanna Troi on TNG were doing the voices of the good guys for awhile,
and now that I think of it, so was that Dobber guy from the show Coach. 
        
        .....you may now return to your normal programming.
