Subject: Parts suppliers ID'd in this list: CAUTION

    A dismantler/supplier in Vermont who has popped up in a &quot;classified&quot; in
this list recently sold me a pair of headlights for my '87 Vanagon.
Initially, the price discussed was $75/side, but when shipping time rolled
around the price &quot;remembered&quot; was $100/side. Since I had taken extensive
notes, and mentioned date and time, the negotiation reduced it to $85/side.
The reason given for the increase over the agreed original price was that
Visa charges six percent for each transaction.
    Since Visa makes use of a long-distance supplier attractive to begin
with, I personally feel that this is a legitimate &quot;cost of business&quot;
expense and not something that should automatically be passed on to a
customer. To charge a PROFIT on said cost comes mighty close to dishonesty.
6 percent of the original cost is only $4.50 - charging ten extra dollars
per SIDE on top of shipping and handling is insulting!
    I don't know how they do things in Vermont, but when I give my word
here in Pennsylvania, I stand by it. I understand these folks are in
business to make money, and they sure made it off me THIS time. Repeat
business for the good folks in Westminster is out of the question, and
they've given mail-order dismantlers everywhere a bad name by playing this
little game with me. I suggest you avoid them too - they seem to feel they
have Van owners over some kind of barrel, but they're wrong. At least I
would hope so! Or maybe I'm just naive?
