&gt; &gt; I see that the Bosch is mentioned alot and was wondering what its smog
&gt; &gt; story is for CA.
&gt; 
&gt; Illegal for any VW in which it was not original equipment.  Most VW's that
&gt; I know of have at least one diaphragm on the distributor (mine has two)
&gt; and they are required to pass emissions.  The 009 is all mechanical advance
&gt; and has no diaphragms.
&gt; 

When I lived in CA and registration time came around, I would pull out the
.009, and reinstall the stock distributer I had kept around.  I got so
proficient at it that it only took a few minutes to swap and re-time, and
back again.
