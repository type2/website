Subject: RE: re:Heavy-duty, rear, permanent, rack question (answer?)

If I were going to put a heavy load on the outside of my Vgon, I would put
it on the front, not in back.  Front gives you better balance, better
brake performance, and additional crush distance in a crash.  Plus you don't
have to arrange for a swing-out (and its cantilever stresses).  Just bolt
the sucker on real good.

On an air-cooled Vgon, you could even consider building your load-carrying
rack into the front of the car.  There's a surprising amount of air space
in there above the spare.  All of this, of course, contingent on a willing-
ness to do surgery to the Vgon's (I think) very handsome lines.

Tell us how it comes out!
