&gt; If you have not yet begun to fight the rear axel nuts, let
&gt; me give you my four cents worth. I am a scarred and tested
&gt; vetran of the axle-nut-wars.
&gt; 
&gt; Hint #1: DONT use a 'flex handle' or 'breaker bar' for these
&gt; applications. What you want is the 3/4 inch 'sliding T handle'
&gt; It is much beefier (TM) than the flex bar, and can handle
&gt; the stress. At Sears, it is even cheaper than the breaker bar.
&gt; It does not have a long handle, only like 18 inches, so you
&gt; will need some pipe. I reccomend 10 feet of galvanized water pipe. 

Better yet; get an *AXLE NUT DRIVER WRENCH*!

Your 1/2 breaker bar goes in it, you put torque on the handle, frap the 
hell out of it with a 5# sledge, and it WILL come loose. No broken tools 
or knuckles!
 
 
&gt; Good luck doing this, is can be quite fun!
