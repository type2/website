     &gt;Sand-blasted the rusted, pitted flap and will prime/ paint it

     &gt;loaded plastic pin!  What does this do.  I'll check it out later.  Me

     You'll see some nothces pressed into the side of the vent housing. The 
     plastic pin locates in any of these notches to give you preset flap 
     positions - I removed the pin, spring etc. cleaned it up and greased 
     it all up so that it worked better - gets very rusty in though :(
     
     I had another problem with my flap though. AS you said the screws 
     which hold the flap to the shaft come loose. I noticed that the screws 
     were NOT locating on the flats on the shaft, in fact the flats were 
     180 degrees out. I ended up filing two new flats opposite the old ones 
     and the screws located fine and no further problems. I examined the 
     shaft and could not see how the flats could be wrong other than 
     manufacturer error :(

     ps, yes I'm at the stage where I take the smallest insignificant parts 
         apart, clean them and put them back - sad really :)
