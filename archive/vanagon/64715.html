hello,
i own a '91 vanagon carat and would like to know whether it can be
converted into a pop-up top. if so, who does it ?

also, i have tried to have the air conditioning unit converted and
recharged by several of service franchises around here (washington, DC),
and they all recommended that i take to the dealer because it has front and
rear units. what's so complicated about it that it cannot be done by the
average gas station ?

thanks,
felix
