TWIMC;
You need three things to go; fuel, fire and timing. When I had a similar
problem I armed my self with a 10mm nut driver, a mason jar and a timing
light. When it quit I took nut driver in hand and removed single bolt
holding the two fuel injectors on the driver side . Be careful not to
lose the small doughnut seals. I aimed the business ends into the jar
and had my SO crank it for a couple of seconds. At this point you should
determine if its a fuel problem. If not replace injectors and hook up
timing light. If you have NO spark the inductive timing light will not
flash. Check timing if able. 

The easiest way to check your coil is to replace it. If you have access
to a VOM let me know and we can do it the hard way.
Good luck
