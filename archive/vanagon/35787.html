Subject: re EV: Cracked Paint on top of pillars

&gt;
&gt;Mine has the cracks.
&gt;
&gt;To all of you that have had this repaired, how did they do it?
&gt;
&gt;Minor touch up?  Did they screw up any of the paint around the seams?
&gt;Do the dealers supposedly know about this problem and it was covered by
&gt;warranty?
&gt;

In my case, they took it and kept it for a couple of days. Although I'm not
sure if they actually 'baked' it (which I've heard does bad things to ABS
systems) but they wanted to keep it warm &amp; dry in the shop for awhile.
It was covered under warranty in my case. Looks fine now.
