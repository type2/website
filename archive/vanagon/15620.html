So leo mulvihill says:

&gt; Ground Clearance, How much are you going to need. Comfort,  Air 
&gt; Conditioning, 4 million people can't be wrong.

I have all of the above, plus ground clearance and based on the
camping trip we just took at Red Rock Canyon, your going to need
all the ground clearance you can get.

&gt; If the VW van is so good, why did VW drop out of the market

They didn't.  Ever hear of the Eurovan, or is your mind on a
permanent vacation?
