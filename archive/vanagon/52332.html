&gt;| 	I never took location into consideration.  I'm from Port St.
&gt;| Lucie, Florida (where the N.Y. Mets have spring training)...And during
&gt;| the weekend I go to Tampa Florida....Is that bad or good for the
&gt;| condition of the bus?  :)

	If you are driving along the coast, you might want to wash it down
real well and apply a coat of sealer (don't know the specifics on which
kinds, if you go to an RV or auto parts store where the people know their
stuff they might be able to recommend a brand. Problem is, most places do
not know their stuff). This is because the loafs worst enemy is rust and
salty sea air will rust your loaf pretty fast without any type of sealant.

&gt;| 	Yeah, I think I should look into a running bus.  How much would a
&gt;| Breadloaf in running condition that looks like crap cost me?  Anyone have
&gt;| an idea?  I've been doing some shopping, but I'd like an idea.	

	I paid $1100 for a loaf that was running a little off. When I
got it home, and started really going over it, I found a lot more wrong
with it - to get it to pass smog in Cal, it cost another $1700. I would
suggest doing a leakdown test, and get someone who knows VWs to kick the
tires, rattle the CV joints, listen to it run and the like to help you
pick one out... It will save you money in the long run to do the tests
before buying it...
