&gt;I am wondering what everyone out there thinks is a reasonable

&gt;
&gt;Has anybody bought a set or heard what people are paying for them
&gt;lately ?

Kevin,
I bought a set of 4 alloys about 3 years ago for $600.  They had been taken
off a new Vanagon (owner wanted bigger/wider wheels) and a guy at the tire
place bought them to use on his own Vanagon - then decided not to.  I figure
he probably 'stole' them from the original owner for about $200. and made a
$400. profit selling them to me.  I thought it was worth it though, as I
don't care for wheel covers in general and really don't like the Vanagon
ones.  
That reminds me.  I've got 3 wheel covers free for anyone who wants to pick
them up or pay the shipping charges.
