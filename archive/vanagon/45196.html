Subject: response-OK....Brakes and an 85 (fwd)


Well let me share with you all I know.

The rear pads are worn.  The mechanic suspected that I may need to have 
the shoes also replaced because it may be egg shaped as a result of the 
uneven wear of the pads.

Up front, the driver-side caliper is all messed up.  The pads are being 
applied unevenly and the rotors look like they've had it.  The mechanic 
suspects that the bad caliper may be causing the pulsating feeling when 
braking.  There is also a groaning sound coming from they believe is this 
bad caliper.

My parking brake is not working well either.

That's all I know.
