Subject: diesel fuel line

While installing my rebuilt starter today, I noticed that the fuel line 
between the fuel filter and the injector pump was cracked where it 
mounted to the pump.  I tried cutting it and reattatching it but it was 
too brittle. The local FLAPS told me that it was &quot;too high pressure&quot; for 
anything they carried.  So I called VW.  The parts guy said that this 3 
foot plastic tubing would cost me $39.40!!!! He also said that it head 
&quot;special metal ends&quot; on it which mine does NOT have. SO my question is, 
would it be a problem to run a length of regular diesel braided fuel 
hose, like the ones that run between the injectors?  Right now I have 
some rubber non-vw hose which Ive clamped on. Its working fine now, but 
Id rather have the better line.  Any ideas?
Do any diesel owners have the linethat the VW guy was talking about?
TIA
