&gt;       Well, you do remember, perhaps, a little thing called the &quot;Arpanet
&gt; Worm&quot; that shut down the entire Internet a few years ago? It worked thru
&gt; e-mail. Not all that hard to do, really. I'm sure you've seen uuencoded 
&gt; files that become executables again, right?

Yes, but these executables have to be RUN in order to infect a machine,
right?  I think this is where the confusion is.  Just downloading
something through e-mail (and not running it) is an unlikely way to
&quot;contract&quot; a computer virus.
