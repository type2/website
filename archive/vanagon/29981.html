hi everyone,
	while i was in the process of replacing the alternator in my
bus i found that three of the four wires that connect to the
alternator were worn through.  when it would rain i would have a
problem with the bus lugging/losing power.  could these wires being
shortened out be the cause of my lugging???  in my little knowledge i
would think it is a possible reason.  i replaced these wires with good
new ones last night.
 
MY PROBLEM is when i took off the alternator backing plate i pulled
one of the wires out of its home in the plastic plug piece and don't
know which one it connects to!!  the plastic piece looks something
like below:

		_________
		|	|
		|   D-	|
		|	|
	---------	---------
	|			|
	|  DF		   D+	|
	|			|
	-------------------------


there is one of these plastic plugs at the alternator and one at the
regulator.  i don't have my notes/sketches with me, but at the
regulator side at D+ (i think it is D+) has a thick red wire and a
thinner blue wire attached.  the wire that got pulled from the
alternator side is a thin black one that goes out of the engine
compartment twords the front.  WHERE DOES IT GO???  i am tempted to
believe it goes into the D+ part of the plug/alternator, but the wire
is black, and more importantly it is also NOT the same wire that is
connected at the regulator side.  i am afraid to hook up my alternator
wrong as i have heard terrible stories and couldn't afford to by
another one.  anyone that could help me out it would be great as i am
all set to plug and play so to speak.  thanks in advance!!!!

take care,
	brandy
