Subject: cyl head temp gauge
Date: Wed, 12 Oct 1994 14:35:11 -0500 (CDT)

I just got my new VDO head temperature gauge kit in the mail. Hee Haw!! Of
course, some things are wrong--as usual: Both the wiring instructions and
the sender are missing. I called up the supplier and they will send both.

My question: the long double wire extending from the sender to the gauge
looks a bit short to me. But the guy on the phone said that it should not
be shortened or lengthened because this would change resistance and hence
affect the reading; the gauge is calibrated for that length. 

I'm also intrigued by the fact that there are only 2 terminals on the back
of the gauge. Were does the contraption get its juice? (Does this have
anything to do with David Carment's battery draining sender?)
