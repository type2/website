Although the AIR system and the CAT did an outstanding job of  reducing C=
arbon Monoxide,  the lean mixtures and higher operating temperatures brou=
ght us another problem.  Oxides of Nitrogen.  These are formed when high =
&quot;peak flame&quot; temperatures and excess oxygen cause oxygen and nitrogen to =
combine.  Nitrogen Oxide and Unburned Hydrocarbons are the primary source=
 of ground level Ozone and Smog.    The primary methods used to reduce th=
e Nitrogen Oxide was to lower the compression ratio, (reduces performance=
, and efficiency),  and to recirculate some of the exhaust gases back int=
o the combustion process.  This is done through the Exhaust Gas Recircula=
tion system, (EGR).  The EGR system fills some of the cylinder space with=
 a small amount of exhaust gas while the engine is operated at part throt=
tle.  As this &quot;spent&quot; gas is inert,  it has the same effect as lowering t=
he compression ratio, which reduces the &quot;Peak Flame Temperature&quot; of the c=
ombustion process.  This reduces the formation of Nitrogen Oxides.  The a=
dvantage of the EGR system over a reduced compression ratio is that it ca=
n be set-up to be disabled at idle and full throttle to restore idle effi=
ciency and full throttle performance.   In the Air Cooled VW engine, the =
EGR adds the additional benefit of letting the engine run cooler with the=
 leaner mixtures required in 70's and 80's cars.   It is unfortunate that=
 most people have removed the EGR system thinking they have increased per=
formance.  Other cars benefit by the EGR system as it reduces an engines =
desire to knock and ping. =

 As we entered the 80's,  the auto industry found another, more effective=
 way to handle the Nitrogen Oxide problem.  This came in the form of the =
Three Way Catalytic Converter.  This Cat is of a Monolithic (one piece) d=
esign that is very compact, lightweight,  efficient, and it does not rest=
rict exhaust flow.  As long as the fuel mixture is perfect, (14 to 1 or &quot;=
Lambda&quot;),  this Cat can reduce unburned hydrocarbons,  carbon monoxide, a=
nd nitrogen oxides.  To provide the precise mixture control needed for th=
is system,  an oxygen sensor was added to provide &quot;Closed Loop&quot; control o=
r fine tuning of the fuel system.  The heart of this system is the &quot;Oxyge=
n Sensor&quot;.  Some late model cars use multiple sensors to provide even mor=
e control.
