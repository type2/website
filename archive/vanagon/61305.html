-- [ From: Tacy Scheckel * EMC.Ver #2.5.02 ] --

ur family has grown and our volvo wagon has not, therefore we'd like to add
a vanagon to clan.  We treat our cars as well as we treat our children and
would make good vanagon parents.  If anyone has a well cared for carat ready
to go to a new home, ours might be just the ticket.  We are interested in a
manual trans, good body, and well mechanically maintained vehicle. Our four
human children want the two rear facing jump seats with the fold down table
and front facing rear convertible bench.  Oh, and by the way we're in the NY
metro area (NJ).  I can be e-mailed at nutley_at_crossnet_dot_org  or NutleyARC
_at_aol_dot_com or phon either John or Tracy at 201-667-9121
