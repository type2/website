Subject:      S&amp;S needs a Syncro to design pipe!

Listees,

  I just got off the phone with S&amp;S, They would like to make the pipes
for a Syncro too.  There is one problem.  Loren (S&amp;S engineer)  wants a
Syncro in his hands to fit this pipe.  I spoke to him for a while and he
and I decided to have me post to the &quot;List&quot; and see if there's anybody
in the Glendale Arizona area that owns a Syncro?

  If somebody is in the area, or plans to be in the near future it would
help, S&amp;S and ALL Syncro owners.

  Anyone that wants to respond to S&amp;S cxan do so by e-maoiling them at
http://www.ssheaders_dot_com/ Or phone them at, (602-847-9000).

  This kind of stuff makes the list a great thing!!

  Kyle
