Subject: august campout/wailaki


Checking in here with details.  Jack Stafford from our list is
going to be up in the Wailaki area ANYWAY ahead of us on vacation,
and has volunteered to check out this campsite and phone me.  I told
him if he did not like it to feel free to make an executive decision
and choose another site in the general vicinity, which I will of
course post to the list upon hearing from him.  If I have to
be away, and anyone needs to reach me by phone about this (like,
if you'll be away from the computer on vacation like Jack), feel
free to phone me at 510.376.4321.  As soon as I hear from Jack,
I'll post to the list, and put something about the matter on
my outgoing phone message tape.  If I haven't yet heard from
Jack on the matter, I'll of course not make a post, nor change
the phone message, so probably best to phone me/check here like
Wednesday or Thursday of next week.

Food:  coming next post - stay tuned!
