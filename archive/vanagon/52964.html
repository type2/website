As my boss would say &quot;schmarblefarbe.&quot;  Which is technical jibberish.  The
only way to measure effective cylinder efficiency is via a compression
test.  I presume that's what they did...

&gt; 
&gt; What is a &quot;Power Balance Test&quot; ? How is it performed ? What does it tell
&gt; you ?
&gt; 
&gt; I recently took my aircooled Vanagon into a new shop to get my air flow
&gt; sensor adjusted. The process of adjustment involved gas analysis and they
&gt; found something they didn't like ... high Hydrocarbons (pre-cat
&gt; converter), so they performed a &quot;power balance test&quot;. I missed the gist
of
&gt; what the tech was explaining, but did catch something about the &quot;lack&quot; of

&gt; power. 
&gt; 
&gt; Power Balance results were:
&gt; 
&gt; #1 cylinder: 73
&gt;  2         : 62
&gt;  3         : 16
&gt;  4         :  5
&gt; 
&gt; I do know that the head seals on the #1 &amp; 2 cylinders are leaking, which
&gt; the tech mentioned. But he also mentioned that there was a &quot;big&quot; problem
&gt; with the #3 &amp; 4 side of the engine.
&gt; 
&gt; Any clues ?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, Chris
