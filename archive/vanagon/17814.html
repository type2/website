Howdy, why yes, I did get it, and have started trying to find all the
little pieces for it. 
As for the nose, I will probably bang it out as well as possible, and
then weld up the little rust holes.
Well, like yourself, I am now in the searching for 2 windshield
situation.
crazy. Also, the roof window seals need replacement NOW
as well as 2 need some welding and patching there as well. 
Well, As of Saturday, I am off to Arizona with my family for 2 weeks. We
are renting a vanagon westy out there, and I am really stoked.
I will post a story to the list as I return. Anyway
see you, if you happen to have a driver's door handle lying around,
Isure do need it, the whole latch assembly actually. As well as the
windshields.
anyway, good luck with the 59
later
Richard
