&gt;&gt; There are no spin-on fuel filters made for gasoline applications.  They
&gt;&gt;are all made for diesel applications.  I found one about the right size,
&gt;&gt;and wa thinking about mounting this on the fan housing.
&gt;&gt;The only nagging question is what is inside that little canister?  Will
&gt;&gt;it filter gas as well as diesel?  Is there a problem at the gasket?  All
&gt;&gt;the rest is easy.  Does anyone have any ideas about this one?  Am I
&gt;&gt;crazy?

Chris:
There are spin-on type gasoline filters. They are used in marine applications.
They look just like oil filters, but have a *very* low restriction. This is
because on most marine applications, the fuel pump is mounted near the engine,
and has to suck the fuel from the tank. The Coast Guard is not thrilled with the
idea of a pressurized fuel system, in case of fuel line breaks.

Now, I still have about 1/2 dozen of these filters and the brackets in stock
from my now-defunct boat repair business. I'll sell you one of them
(filter/bracket set)for $20.00, shipping included. The replacement filters are
available from any marine supply house, or boat motor dealer, and cost about
$6.00.

Take care,
