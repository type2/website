Subject: Any sources for vinyl flaps up front?
Date: Mon, 4 Dec 1995 17:46:49 -0600 (CST)

Hey everyone!  Working on the interior of my '79 Westy and I have 
a couple of questions.  

1. Does anyone know where I could get another set of the 
vinyl flaps that wrap around the bottom of the front seats?
You know the ones that cover the little comparments under
the seats.  Mine are ripped to hell and I haven't seen them
in any of the mail order catalogs. 

2. Can anyone recommend a good dye for the curtains.  They're in
great shape physically, but too much Texas sun has bleached them
in spots making them unattractive.  Is there a dye that is resistant
to bleaching by the sun?

3. Does anyone know of a source for the weatherstripping around
the front vents under the grille?  It does get somewhat cold down
here in the winter and although I probably won't splurge for new
heating ducts I'd like to at least keep the cold air out!  ;-)

It's amazing what X-14, 409, Resolve and 5 hours worth of work
will do to improve the inside of a bus!  1000% better now...
