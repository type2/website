Subject: Re: Westy rental?

You mentioned you have a 78 bus which needs an AUTO trans.  I had a 73 bus
with an AUTO which started to slip when shifting to 3rd gear.  After calling
many many places in oregon and wash. I found 3.  Two of them were $700-800.
and the other was $300.  They were all at junk yards and had a 30-60 day
warr.  I promtly drove to get the $300 tranny, put it in an never had a
problem, I even put 75k miles on it.  
Anyway if you are interested in checking WA and OR. VW graveyards e-mail me
and I can give you phone #s.
