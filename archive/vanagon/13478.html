&gt; I'm too lazy to quote from a digest right now, but I'm a little confused 
&gt; about the definition of &quot;Kombi&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I've been told/led to believe that it is a Kombi.  Am I right?
&gt; 
an easy way to tell right off the bat is that Kombi's were only painted
a single color, whereas passenger wagens were painted two-tone. Also, a
Kombi has no headliner in the cargo area, and no wall paneling there
also. My friend just got a really nice '64 Kombi, and it is just like
this. Another way to tell is to check the second number of your VIN. A 2
means passenger wagen, and something else is Kombi (I forget which)
