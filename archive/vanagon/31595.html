Subject: Meeting w/VW reps

I contacted VOA in reference to the head gasket seepage. (the 
bahrsleak has slowed but it is still dripping) I have an 
appointment with the zone rep and the service manager of the local 
VW dealership.  Does anyone have any ammunition or information I 
can use to convince them that it is a manufacturing problem?
