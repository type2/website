Subject: Re: engine search



&gt;	I am still looking for a reman. engine and I think that
&gt;i found a decent place to get one.  The shop is called Action
&gt;Volkswagon or AVP.  I have called numerous places looking for
&gt;reman. longblocks and they seem to be the most trustworthy.AVP
&gt;has longblocks with the same warranty as VW ,12mo. 12k mi., for
&gt;$1600 with a core charge of $600. 
&gt;	Has anyone dealt with AVP in this regard or any other
&gt;companies.  I know about GEX and some others.
&gt;Advice, experience and tips are much appreciated.
&gt;thanks

I have used AVP a few times and they have impressed me with their 
professionalism and the quality of their work.  I got an air-cooled 
bus motor from them for a friend, who is (so far) very happy with 
it.  Also I sold a water-cooled Westy to list member David Sidote 
that had an AVP rebuilt head and he has not had any problems with 
it.  Have also used AVP air-cooled heads with no problems.
