Subject: intro.

Hello world.  I'm not using my own email address, it's my father's.  My name
is Jason, not Don.  Well I'm new to this whole bus thing, but am in love
with the one I've got.  She's a ' 75 with manual transmission.  She needs a
little work but nothing major.  Is there an FAQ I could get?  That would
help out a lot.  Now about the bus.

I have a slight leak somewhere around the gas tank, it only spills out when
she's more than 1/2 - 3/4 full.  I smoke so you could imagine what kinda
problems that could cause.  Any help would be great.  Also I need to know
about company's that sell the peices needed to convert it to a camper
(sinks, fridge, etc).  She already has an A.C. hookup so the process has
already been started.

Jason Bowen
