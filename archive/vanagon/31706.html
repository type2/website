Subject: Re: Hot Wire ...point voltage

&gt;                      RE&gt;How to hot wire a VW or what to do...       1/1/96
&gt;
&gt;A suggestion:  Many to most ignition systems use the full 12 volts  across the
&gt;points and coil for starting, and then once running, use a resistor to drop
&gt;the voltage to a lessor value while running.  This reduces arcing on the
&gt;points.  May I suggest that you inspect your points now that you are home, or,
&gt;perhaps replace them on general purposes and throw the ones you take out into
&gt;your travel spares kit?

&gt;
&gt;Good idea, ...I'm thinking electronic ignition soon...any suggestions in 
 that area?
