Subject: proud new papa

Hi, folks.  I've been lurking for a few weeks while my wife and i have been
shopping for a bus. we found one and will soon be proud new owners (parents?)
of a '65 microbus with a rebuilt '76 engine. the guy who was restoring the
bus did all of the mechanical work, and made some modifications.  we're hoping
to get a list of all the modifications he made so when we take it for service
the mechanic doesn't open the engine compartment and say &quot;huh?!?!?&quot;.  it runs
like a dream. the inside was stripped bare, but who cares? we can customize it
until we're ready (and rich enough) to restore it.  the body is in decent shape
for a 30 year old bus that's lived in vermont most of its life.

so, are you all going to caravan to vermont???

well, that's all for now. i'm sure i'll be writing again.

peace,

johnny b.
