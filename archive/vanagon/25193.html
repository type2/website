&gt; hello guys and dolls....
&gt; I pulled the vent cover off ('65 microdelux) the front of the air duct.  HOH
&gt; was always leaking in during a drive in the rain.  The PPO siliconed the 
&gt; gutters along the front (OUCH!) but this didn't do the trick.  Turns out the
&gt; seal (rubber) was in poor shape (What'd ya want for 30 year old rubber) and
&gt; the set screws from the lever to flap was loose.  Never closed all the way!
&gt; SO, I'm rehabing it.   Sand-blasted the rusted, pitted flap and will prime/
&gt; paint it tonight.  I noticed on the driver's side of the flap is a spring
&gt; loaded plastic pin!  What does this do.  I'll check it out later.  Me suspects
&gt; that you can close the flap up tight (for the winter)?

I think it's to hold the flap at whatever angle you set it at by
catching in one of those three bulges or dents in the side of the
ventilation box.  Describe this pin some more to me--I noticed
I have the spring and its little holder but no pin.  Cool.

I also have (in my Clymer manual) a diagram of how the internal stuff
wants to go.  Send your snailmail address if you want a copy of it.
