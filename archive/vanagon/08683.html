&gt; I like this bus enough that I want to replace the fuel lines 
&gt; so my questions are--I've traced the lines leaving the fuel pump
&gt; going up but would like advice on how to get at them up by
&gt; the carbs:  should I start by removing the air cleaner and is
&gt; it right back there or is it better to try and remove some engine
&gt; tin and get in from below.  Does this question make any sense?
&gt; The line leaves the fuel pump and vanishes up; the lines leave
&gt; the carbs and vanish down and FRONT.  There's all this stuff in
&gt; the way, argh.  Don't any of you 73-and-on people start gloating
&gt; about your access hatches.
&gt; 
&gt; Also--I'm planning on taking the old lines to my FLAPS and getting
&gt; some fuel hose there, I don't need any special VW-approved hose do I?
&gt; 
&gt; Also--The gas tank was empty and the owner put a quart or so in.  I 
&gt; know gas is getting to the fuel pump (started to spill when I undid
&gt; the hoseclamp) but how worried should I be about gunk and crud?  I
&gt; don't think it was started for a year.
&gt; 
&gt; thanks in advance--you all are great--
&gt; 
&gt; As the former owner of a '72, I will chime in here. Access to the carbs on
 a '72 is not great as you are already aware. You can work on them , the
 fuel lines and tee if you remove the air cleaner. To get it out, you will
 have to remove the paper hose that goes from the heater booster fan to the
 engine tin on the right hand side. The air cleaner is held to it's mounting
 plate by over-center bales which you can't see, but will have to feel. When
 removing it, remember that it has oil in it, you really don't want to turn it
 upside down. Once it is out, you will be able to see the fuel lines. If you
 want more access, you can remove the aforementioned booster fan and the
 carbon canister from the evaporative emissions system (make sure to put it
 back before you start the car though, otherwise gasoline vapor from the 
 tank will be vented into the engine compartment, not a good idea from an 
 explosion prevention standpoint.)

 As for the tank, my '74 sat for 18 months before I bought it. I cleaned the
 &quot;sock&quot; filter at the tank outlet and found some rusty sludge there, but I 
 haven't had any trouble, knock on wood.
