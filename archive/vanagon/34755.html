Subject: Re: Which bus hould I buy?


&gt;&gt; In '65 or earlier cars (all makes), no smog inspection is required, so 
you
&gt;&gt; can indeed put any engine you want, with any mods you want.
&gt;
&gt;I was told by the DMV that no  every-other-year inspection is required
&gt;for 65 and earlier cars, but that a smog certificate WAS required for
&gt;change of ownership.  You might want to check into this before you buy a
&gt;'63 bus with a small block Chevy motor in it.

But don't let it stop you!   :^)

If the small-block is also around '63 vintage, a year when there were
almost no smog equipment requirements, then you're probably home free
anyway.

It's only when you get up to the late '70s and '80s, when there was more
smog stuff than engine stuff inside the hatch, that you start to have
problems with the CA Smog Gestapo.   :(
