Subject: Re: DIY Westy conversion -II (Off with their heads!)

Since I was asked...  will post details/measurements when done, if 
successful. I won't feel confident about all this until it's done. &quot;It ain't 
over 'til it's over&quot;

&gt;How is your conversion coming? Is the curve of the roof different on the
&gt;stock Vanagon compared to the Westy. I have been told that the Westfalias
&gt;come from the factory with a different roof. The suggestion was to slice the
&gt;top off at the roof pillars and weld a Westy top on. This sounds a little
&gt;drastic.

Hole is cut, edges rolled under/etc.  On front and back I rolled down 90 
degrees for 1.00&quot; lip, then rolled in again 90 for 1/4&quot; lip.  This gives a 
bit of a 'C-beam' cross-section to the edges for stiffening and gets rid of 
sharp edges!!  The roof padding fits nicely back in there, then head liner 
wraps around and onto old outer roof using contact cement (need to do this) 
I used some 1/8&quot; panelling plastic edging to cover cut edges/save headliner. 
 Side rails are bent down 90 x 1&quot;, then out 90x1&quot; to make a ledge for foot 
of poptop brace. Under 'out' lip is 1&quot; box tubing, well screwed to existing 
roof 'frame' (watch lights, speaker wires!!) for extra support.  Repeat 
headliner wrap/glue.  I have some Westy roof panelling for that area, may 
use it to cover things more 'Westy-like'. Front hold down latch worked out 
well, 4x 3/8&quot; holes in the right place, once the roof is out of the way just 
close up with the latch together and mark the spot.  The 4 holes pass 
through a thick inner lip on the forward roof beam, using factory backer 
plate for strength, easy/identical fit!

        Yes, factory roof would be ideal. Way to do it is to make a shallow 
cut (nibbler?) about 1&quot; above rain gutters all around except go down 
through/below rain gutters near crossbeams.  The roof and beams could be 
seperated from roof perimeter 'frame' with chisel (although they may just be 
mated with a glue bond???). It appears that although the roof beams and 
panel is different, once you get to the roof perimeter 'frame' the vans 
become the same again. Big maybe, since I'm going by memory from when I 
gutted out the real Westy 9 months ago.  Having the donor vehicle nearby 
would be major bonus. My friend won't let me gut his Westy, wonder why ;&gt;.   Tim
