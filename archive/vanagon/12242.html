Hi Alistair.  Thanks for your help. I have saved, and printed out all 
the information everyone has contributed so far.  I'm not sure that 
it is the pump that is failing at this time, but I shall keep this 
info in case I have to dig further.  I shall let everyone know the 
outcome of this drama, for sure!

Thanks,

Harry.

&gt; Remove the hose from the pump and undo the 3 bolts that secure the top
&gt; plate of the pump to the body. There is an O-ring between the two parts,
&gt; see if it is still good. Examine the top plate, are there circular wear
&gt; marks (deep) on the surface? You can polish then out on emery cloth and a
&gt; flat surface. Inside the body there is a vaned pump mechanism that will
&gt; &quot;screw&quot; up and out when the engine is turned over, pushing itself against
&gt; the top plate and making a good seal.
&gt;  The black vanes should be free moving in their slots so that they can be
&gt; flung outwards by centrifugal/centripetal force when the mechanism rotates.
&gt; See if they do move, sometimes as the mechanism wears against the top
&gt; plate the slots get sort of peened over and drag on the vanes. I carefully
&gt; filed the peened-over slots with a safe-sided little file that originally
&gt; is used for sharpening Japanese saws.
