    Thought you might want to know:

    In Reno Nv. the local VW Dealker has 2 new eEV Winnie campers
1) auto 28,000
2)5 speed 27,000

they seem to be dying to loose these, the prices are on the front 
window iin big flourescent letters.

&gt;Hello Dan,
&gt;
&gt;In response...
&gt;
&gt;&gt;So, before I pony up Cdn $45,000 (which I don't have),
&gt;&gt;can V_at_L members advise me?  Is the 5-cylinder reliable?
&gt;&gt;Is the front-engine design sorted out yet?  Is the
&gt;&gt;4-speed automatic any good?  Is the paint better?
&gt;&gt;Should I see my bank manager?
