Subject: RE: need  advice about a  bus...

	Evan,
	I'd find someone I trust and indeed have them do it. You'll
help the process if you arrange both regular phone calls with them
and fax back and forth- you want to see a WRITTEN list of everything
they want to do and what it will cost you.
	For starters, you want a standard vehicle inspection- with
checklist- done. If they don't have a checklist they normally follow,
consider another shop, I suppose. The dealer I go to out here has
a one page list that's a good start, and the local independant shop
is so proud of their checklist they'll give you a copy so you can
diy at home.

	The $150 towing charge... hmm, I'm cheap, and would tend
to want to get it running myself, and possibly fail and have to
have it towed. How much of your time is worth $150? How much is
the hassle of bringing tools worth, in cash? That $150 starts sounding
cheap to me.

	Bill
