Subject: Re: Hella H4 Headlights


I've used the H4s on most of my cars..I have them on my 86 GTI (converted
to the Euro-grille). My preferance is to use the 80/100W headlights!

For those of you who are about to say I'm blinding oncomming traffic
with my low-beams...no way. If you look at the design of the headlights
beam pattern it looks like this
                                -------/

there is a low cut off on the side of the beam which is into the incomming
lane.
