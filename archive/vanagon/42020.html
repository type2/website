Subject: Re: '71 With High Brake Effort Fixed!!!

Hi,

Thanks to everyone who responded to my querry about high brake
effort.  It turned out to be a couple of things.  First, the one way
valve in the vaccuum line to the booster was cloged.  Once I
replaced it things were ok for a little while until it sarted
pulling right.  The wheel was hot from the brake dragging.  The car
hasn't been driven regularly for about four years so I pulled of the
wheels and calipers and cleaned everything up, including some rust
on the pads.  I moved the pistons around a bit and made sure they
were moving freely.  That improved things alot.  I would'nt be
surprised if they started leaking, but so far they don't.  Next
weekend I'll pull of the drums on the back and have a look.

BTW:  I bought the Turtle ('71 Camper) in SC in '88 with 50K miles
on it, no rust.  Moved to WI in '90, drove it one winter and it did
more damage to the car than the the previour 17 years had done.  I've
stored it in winter ever since.  It now has 106K miles on it.  I've
been to busy with school to even have much time to use it for the
last four years of so, but I finally insured it again last week.  It
feels really great to have it up and running again!!!  

Chris
