&gt;Please, what is a wasserboxer??

Horizontally opposed engines are often refered to as a &quot;boxer&quot; engine.  Many
stories on why this description exists, but one is that the pistons on one
side of the engine resemble a boxer's fists making punches.

VW has made more horizontally opposed engines than anyone, but until 1983
they were all air cooled.  For the 1983-1/2 Vanagon (In the USA anyway) VW
dropped their other air cooled and diesel powered engines and installed their
new &quot;waterboxer&quot; (&quot;wasserboxer&quot; if using a German tone, pronounced
&quot;vasserboxer&quot;) engine.  This engine is a 1.9 liter displacement flat four
that is watercooled, thus the &quot;wasser&quot; part of &quot;wasserboxer&quot;.  In the USA
anyway, this engine was the only Vanagon engine available from 1983-1/2 to
1985.  In 1986 VW installed their &quot;new &amp; improved&quot; 2.1 lite wasserboxer and
used it until the last Vanagon model year of 1991.
