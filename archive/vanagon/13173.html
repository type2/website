So David Schwarze says:
&gt; 
&gt; You gonna listen to advice from a guy that drives a Wasserboxer??  :)

You gonna listen to advice from a guy that breaths burning propane all
night in his camper?  ;p

&gt; I have mine disconnected, but it probably isn't a good idea to leave it
&gt; that way unless you are in a very warm climate and always take the time to
&gt; warm your engine up properly.  Even then...

Remember, David is in San Diego.  They don't have weather there.   ;)
