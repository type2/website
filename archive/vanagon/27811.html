Subject: WTB: clock for breadloaf
Date: Tue, 31 Oct 95 16:03:56 PST

  Does anyone have the clock that fits in the right hand &quot;hole&quot; in the 
  dash on a breadloaf &lt;mine is a '74, but they should all be the same,
  right?&gt; that they would be willing to sell?

  I thought about putting a tach there, but I've decided that a clock
  would provide more useful information - besides, the engine gives an
  AUDIBLE report on it's activity on a continuous basis. 

  I'll pay good money for one of these, so here's an opportunity for one of
  you junkyard plunderers to turn a profit on those  weekends you spend
  at the Pick-U-Part.


  Timelessly yours,

  Dave
