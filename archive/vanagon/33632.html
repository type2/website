Subject: Splitty brakes &amp; tyres

Hi everyone,

1962 Kombi

I got the rear hub/axle nuts undone, but the hubs won't come off because the
brake adjusters are seized up, I can't slacken the brakes off enough...

The adjusters are soaking in WD-40 overnight &amp; I'll try with a bigger
screwdriver tomorrow (my cheapo one bent like toffee on them). In the meantime,
any suggestions?

Also, anyone in the UK know of a good, fast mail-order place that stock '62
brake parts? All VW shops in Bristol say pre-'64 is too old for them to get.

Also, what's the correct pressure for the tyres? 

Thanks
Sarah
