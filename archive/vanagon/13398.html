Subject: 6v flasher relay



Does anyone know if a 6v four-way flasher relay will survive for a measurable
amount of time at 12v?

I know 6v wiper motors die quickly at 12v and 6v starter motors don't mind 12v.

My '66 is mere weeks away from certification:-)

Still needed:

a front floor (at least patch holes)
seatbelts
wipers	(and wiper fluidics)
heater tube
4-ways

I should probably also duct-tape the tears in the seats...
