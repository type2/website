Subject: 66 VW Camper

I have a 66 camper that hasn't run for 10 years.....had a rod knock when I
parked it.  Body is  not great, but a VW mechanic could probably get it
going  and it would be good for backwoods (ie. fire roads) camping.  It
has an external oil cooler and some other special parts. 50
bucks and you drag it away.

e-mail me if interested.


Fred
