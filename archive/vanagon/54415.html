Subject: Re: Sliding door on '90 popping open


	My Westy did this same thing when I bought it.  I fixed it by
adjusting and re-tightening the gold rod that the door mechanism latches
onto.  The rod that is towards the rear of the door opening.All you need
is an open end wrench. Apparently mine had wiggled outward enough that the
door would bounce open quite frequently.  Of course I don't hane any young
'uns to worry about, but it still scared the hell out of me:)

&gt; &gt; For the last two mornings on the way to work, the sliding door on my '90
&gt; &gt; Camper has popped open.  In the past I've had a little trouble closing
&gt; &gt; it--if you don't give it just the right &quot;touch&quot; when you close it, the
&gt; &gt; back end doesn't seem to engage.  A little oil on the latch has alway
&gt; &gt; seemed to cure that, tho.  Its not popping open all the way, just the
&gt; &gt; back end pops out.  This morning I heard a faint &quot;thunk&quot; and then air
&gt; &gt; noise, and when I stopped at the office it was slightly open back
&gt; &gt; there.  Any suggestions on what to adjust, replace, etc.?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; TIA,
