 coolant hose on the roll for applications on yachts. If someone knows an 
 exact diameter (if it is metric, it will have to cross to SAE) and I 
 will check on how much per foot. I use one place that has every kind of 
 engine hose you can imagine and all sold by the foot. I don't know if 
 there are any hard turns in the hose that might present problems in 
 collapsing the hose not being pre-formed, but if there is there would be 
 the possibility of putting a stainless-steel spring inside the hose at 
 that point to keep it open in the bend. Just an idea, I will research 
 this if anyone is interested. &gt;&gt;

Mark,
Thank you for the generous offer, but I doubt it would help for more than a
couple of the many hoses needed for the Wasserboxer.  Nearly all the hoses
have significant bends and most have a different diameter at each end!!  VW
didn't make it easy for us to use non-VW hoses!!  

Thanks again - keep the ideas coming!
Jim Davis
