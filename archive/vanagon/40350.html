Subject: RE: neat old bus manual find


&gt;My favorite sentence so far:  &quot;The closed body of clean and pleasing
&gt;countours offers extremely low air resistance.&quot;

What's so strange about that?

A bus is much more aerodynamic than, say, the Oscar Meyer Wienermobile.
Or the vehicle that brings the Space Shuttle from the Assembly Building
out to the launch pad.   :^)

 &quot;Tax the rich, subsidize the poor.&quot;
 &quot;From each according to his means, to each according to his needs.&quot;
 Any Questions?
