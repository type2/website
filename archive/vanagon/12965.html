Jon Christensen sez:
&gt;As far as the manual goes, the tranny and its front mount are different 
&gt;than a 61's, as are the wiring connectors and of course the 36 hp motor.

But I say...

Gotta crawl under it and look.  Halfway thru the year, they changed from 
split case (early) to tunnel case (late).

A split-case will have a round mount, while a tunnel with have a sqaurish,
mount with two holes on a diagonal at the bottom.  If you need an ASCII
diagram, I maybe can hack one out.  

There is and adapter available so you can put a tunnel case trans in a
split-case bus - BTDT.

&gt;I'm not sure about the brakes.  The master cylinder is common with the 67 
&gt;&amp; earlier models.  I'd cross reference a good supplier--Vintage Parts, 
&gt;Wolfsburg West, or Rocky Mtn Motorworks to see what part numbers are the 
&gt;same for the various years on the wheel cylinders, shoes &amp; drums.  Good Luck!

I'd say '66 and earlier.  '67 is a one-year-only pony with a dual circuit
master cylinder.  I've had sucess swapping master cylinders bewtixt earlier
years, just so long as you get both the master cylinder _and_ the resevoir.
