&gt; OK, but a byproduct of the combustion in burning propane (among other

If the water is condensing on the pot, it's losing heat on contact
with the clay.  You really don't have anything to worry about.
If you left the pot on wet dirt and it absorbed a lot of water in a 
small area, then it could expand unevenly as the wet part would
conduct the heat better.  But the explosion would only be the pot 
cracking into 3-6 peices and falling down on the top of the stove.
Not a big danger.
