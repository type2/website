Subject: (FFF)riday....

In the beginning was the plan
and then came the assumptions
and the assumptions were without form
and the plan was completely without substance
and the darkness was upon the face of the workers
and they spoke amongst themselves, saying
	&quot;It is a crock of sh*t, and it stinketh&quot;
and the workers went unto their supervisors and sayeth unto them
	&quot;It is a pail of dung and none may abide the odor thereof&quot;
and the supervisors went unto their managers and sayeth unto them
	&quot;It is a vessel of fertilizer, and none may abide its strength&quot;
and the directors spoke amongst themselves, saying one to another
	&quot;It contains that which aids plant growth, and it is 
	 very strong&quot;
and the directors went unto the vice presidents and sayeth unto them
	&quot;It promotes growth and is very powerful&quot;
and the vice presidents went unto the president and sayeth to him,
	&quot;This new plan will actively promote the growth and efficiency
	 of this company, and these areas in particular&quot;
and the president looked upon the plan
and saw that it was good,
and the plan became policy.
THIS IS HOW SH*T HAPPENS
