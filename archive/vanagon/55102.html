&gt; (Provided your mirror is the same as my '83.5) remove the two phillips

&gt; paint when pulling it off.
&gt; 
&gt; Inside the base you will see (probably covered with corrosion) a nut 
&gt; (10mm?) over a spring/washer assembly.  By tightening this nut (hold 
&gt; mirrow securely and use a socket) you can reduce the play.  Its really a 
&gt; kind of ball and socket mechanism.

Unfortunately, this was a poor design by VW.  The piece of hex stock 
which has been threaded to take the nut sticks into the &quot;socket&quot; of the 
mechanism by only about 1/8th inch, and can be backed out by the action 
of tightening the nut.  When this happens the mirror is basically junk.  
I've tried repairing this with epoxy-type glues and a pin, with limited 
success.
