Our '85 doesn't have the smoke alarm (thank goodness) but does have:

manually retractable power cord near the floor
headrests with holes (Audi-ish)
speedo with only KPH and good for 6 digits
manuals and labels only in English
rear aux heater
drivers seat that automatically adjusts to miss the steering wheel when swiveled
amber headlights
shower thingy

ok... the last three I was just kiddin' around :-)
