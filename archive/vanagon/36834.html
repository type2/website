Subject: Re: The dreaded ZOONING gestapo, what to do?

1. BIG Privacy fence?
2. A couple big mean dogs.
3. Quit using exhaust systems and mufflers, and ONLY test your engines in 
   the middle of the night.
4. Find something EXTREMELY annoying that is not prohibited by zoning 
   regulations and do it. (Paint giant mushrooms on the side of your house.)

Good Luck :)

Oohwee, would I be in trouble in your neighborhood!
