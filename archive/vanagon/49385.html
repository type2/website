Subject: Storing Repair Manuals

I've been looking for something to store my repair manuals in, other 
than just stuffing them in a cupboard of my Westi.  Finally found the 
right object at the right price and would like to share.
It can store my Bently (in it's 3 ring binder), Haynes, Muir, and 
still have room for prints of various relevant posts (No, I DON'T 
have a satellite setup and appropriate computer installed in the bus)
It is designed to hold hanging folders (Pendaflex is one brand) so the 
soft cover manuals stay held together and not scrunched.
It's a Personal File I found at a GOOD stationary supply store.  Its 
about 6 inches by 13 inches and about 11 inches tall, with a tight 
fitting cover to keep out the mice. Cost $7, others can be found that 
lock or are fancier for twice that.  The specifics on the one I 
found:
Brand: Rogers Personal File
Manufacturer: Newell Office Products Group
BTW it's made from 25% post consumer plastic!
