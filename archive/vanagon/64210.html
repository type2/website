Subject:      Idle setting on '84 WasserBoxer (w DigiJet)

I am attempting to rectify the wrongs of my bus's DPO by doing a full
tune-up. I have the Bentley manual, and am attempting to set the idle,
which is around 1100 rpm. The manual directs me to remove the idle
stabilizer plugs, plug them together (done), then simply &quot;adjust the
idle&quot;. Could some kind soul tell me where this is done, and how?
Bentley assumes I know how...

Also, I notice that when I put a timing light onto the engine, I do
not see any timing mark whatsoever. This worries me immensely. I am
hoping that the high idle has something to do with that, but normally
a high idle only puts the timing mark only a little ways away from the
proper place.

Last silly question... the detailed manual does not tell me which
cylinder is 1, which is 4, so I am deducing the following from the
ignition sequence and the ignition wires:

                front of bus
                |               |
                |  4        2
                |               |
                |               |
                |  3        1
                -----------------
                rear of bus

Thank you fellow Vanagon-ers.
