Subject: Re:  Tygon tubing

oh yeah that was me - i didnt worry too much gas-tygon compat. because i
aint got no steeking gas - its an oil burner Vanagon !!

fuel oil- tygon is cool - wouldnt use it with gasoline though - just like
the chart says ...

actually the lines dont see much in the way of fuel - only when the beast is
tipped one way or the other. Still, after all the work of dropping the tank
i wouldnt want to kill the job by cheaping out on the wrong hoses ...

thanks for note alistair - gassers heed this advice.
