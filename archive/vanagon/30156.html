VERY interesting report, to me, since erratic idle - hot, warm 
and cold - continues to bug my '89.  I'm curious which, if 
any, of the things you did seemed to make the most difference?  
Was there a night/day effect from any single item on your list 
(eg, O2 sensor, water temp sensor, general de-gunk?)
