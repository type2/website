Subject: Eurovan trim panel

Mail*Link(r) SMTP               Eurovan trim panel
Is there anyone else out there who has a '93 Eurovan with a right rear plastic
interior trim panel that starts rattling/squeaking as the exterior/interior of
the van heats up?  I've traced it to the plastic trim piece itself, and I know
it's (reasonably) securely attached via clips, etc.
If anyone's tackled this problem, and resolved it successfully, I'd love to
hear from you.  
Norman
