congratulations!


i am going to empty then refill the transmition fluid.  i need a 17mm
hex wrench, 3 quarts of transmition oil, and somesort of pump to get
it all in there.  these are also on my shopping list.  it looks pretty
easy. empty then refill until it begins to spill back out.  anything
else?

If you drain it warm  It drains a lot quicker.  Same with pumping in that
thick gear oil.


hey, how come when I patch stuff in sometimes it has those &quot;&gt;&quot;  thingies and
sometimes not?
