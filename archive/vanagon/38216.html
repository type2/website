&gt;All you Diesel-Vanagon and Wasserboxer drivers out there, how long after

&gt;Diego where I'm doing this.

The Vanagon cooling system holds a lot of water.  If van is not sitting
still, fan will never come on except when the AC is turned on.   This
supports the AC condenser.  As I avoid traffic as much as possible, I will go
for months without the fan running.  In fact, I often go out of my way to let
the idle for a long while to get things hot enough for the fan to run as a
test.
