Subject: Re: Interesting Bus conversions

&gt; &gt; 	In the 70s, a Porsche shop in the Soquel/Aptos area south of
&gt; &gt; Santa Cruz had a bread-loaf pickup truck with tandem rear axles as a 
&gt; &gt; flat-bed-hauler for injured sportscars. It was light blue and I dearly
&gt; &gt; wish I'd taken a picture of it! I never climbed under it to figure out
&gt; &gt; which of the rear wheel pairs were powered- it was like:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	  ======
&gt; &gt; 	 //   ||
&gt; &gt; 	//---- |
&gt; &gt; 	|  ___ |________/======\_______
&gt; &gt; 	#=//o\\_________//o\ /o\\______\
&gt; &gt; 	   \_/           \_/ \_/
&gt; &gt;
&gt; This bus (or one like it) is for sale in the classifieds in the back of
&gt; this month's Hot VW's...
&gt; now's your chance to get it :)

&gt; 
	The breadloaf tandem axle pickup in Hot VWs looks like:

&gt; &gt; 	  ______
&gt; &gt; 	 //   ||_____________
&gt; &gt; 	//---- |_____________|__
&gt; &gt; 	|  ___ |         ========\--__
&gt; &gt; 	#=//o\\_________//o\   /o\\___--
&gt; &gt; 	   \_/           \_/   \_/

	Which is hardly the same thing! What made the one I saw so
stiking was that the flat bed was LOWER than the tops of the rear fenders!

	They also want an irrational ammount of money for it.

	There are two attractive crew-cabs in there, however, a 71 for 8K
and a 69 for 5K, both in Texas. Guess I have to start thinking of Texas
as a hot-bed of VWs! Expensive VWs...
