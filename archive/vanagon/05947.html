Subject: RE: generator article (another viewpoint on electricity :)


	If its simply a choice between out in the woods with a 
generator and not going out into the woods, I'm inclined to leave
people and their electrical needs at home. Oh well, I guess I'm 
just getting old. When I went fishing with my grandfather, just
fishing, and being with him, were most of what I wanted. IMHO,
camping is about being at home, outdoors. I can see why a generator
is part of this for other people, but not for me.
