&gt; over various corners and edges of the windshields of cars in CA and
&gt; elsewhere? No crashes yet have been attributed to these stickers, fuzzy
&gt; dice, glittery crystal things, dashboard shrines, etc.-- ICSWs take note.

   There is one thing you mentioned that I take exception to.  I have 
been in an accident that was caused by the crystal hangy down thang on 
someone elses window.  I was sideswiped in my pinto by a guy who was 
blinded by the crystal thing in the car next door causeing him to miss 
the slight curve in the road and sideswipe ME.  I know of at least one 
fatality atributed to those crystal things as well.  She was showing off 
her sparkly crystal thing to a passenger in the back seat and slammed 
into a bridge abuttment.  Stupid drivers need as few distractions as 
possible when driving in order to keep the rest of us safe.
