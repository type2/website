&gt;Now, especially for the furnace fiends, my current aux battery
&gt;is a 12 volt golf cart unit, something like 35 AMP. So at 1.5 amps
&gt;continous, you are looking at 24hrs of operation, no doubt less in the
&gt;real world. Ron would like something bigger, and so would I.
&gt;
&gt;Since I'm already giving up cargo space for the furnace, I want to find
&gt;the biggest, meanest deep discharge battery that will still fit in that
&gt;little, depth challenged space. When I took the Westie to my FLBS
&gt;(friendly local battery store) the best the could do, with numerous
&gt;trips back and forth for trial fits, was the 35 amp unit. So I bought
&gt;it.
&gt;
&gt;If the ideal battery is still available in Europe, maybe someone could
&gt;organize a group purchase, and ...nah...don't look at me. (Besides, I'll
&gt;just bet batteries are harder to ship, hazardous and all that.) 
&gt;
&gt;As an alternative, maybe *your* FLBS has more selection, or creative
&gt;alternatives. Lets hear about them.

I'm currently looking into the Stinger battery.  WAY expensive, but if it
fits, I'll consider it.  Like Tom said, I want the meanest battery I can
get for the new furnace.
