&gt;All in all, I was pleased at the way it drove, its power, the layout of
&gt;the dash, etc.  I was impressed at the VW part and some of the Winnabego
&gt;stuff, but saw a few disappointing details in the camper part. 
&gt;Dissapointing stuff included the low ground clearance (probably about 5
&gt;or 6 inches with the propane fixtures), the new table systems, and the
&gt;comfort of the beds (both beds had about an inch and a half of padding,
&gt;if that much) and of course, the price tag.

In my 3 weeks spent in the Winnie Euro, I found the beds to be plenty
comfortable.  The padding is thinner, but it's still enough.  The head
space on the top bunk is terrible, however, and I wouldn't want to sleep up
there.

The ground clearance is also terrible.  I pretty much destroyed both the
propane guard and the greywater valve (scraped completely off) on the
Inuvik trip.  The funny thing is, Westfalia did this MUCH better in their
conversion.  They mounted the propane controls so that they hung maybe an
inch below the car's body.

The tables are actually a little less convenient to set up, but much more
comfortable to use.  They don't have the 'wobble' that the table in my
Westie has.
