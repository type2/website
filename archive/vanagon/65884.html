Subject:      new Michelin XZX reinforced FS

  I have one brand new Michelin XZX tire, the reinforced
model, which has never been mounted or used, mainly
because I can't find a mate for it since it has been discontinued
by the manufacturer.

        So make me an offer, or sell me one so I'll have a pair.
