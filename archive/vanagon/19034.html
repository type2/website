Subject: Re: Are GEX rebuilt engines good?

&gt;Hello again all. Thanks for the info on obtaining rebuilt heads. But, sad
&gt;to say, our '81 Westy's engine seized last night. So it sounds like a 
&gt;rebuilt engine from GEX would be the most cost effective option now.
&gt;Want to get the Westy roadworthy again. Any experiences you have had
&gt;with GEX would be welcome. Thanks!

Lisa believe it or not with all the type IV motors we build I'm reccomending
the VW rebuilds from the dealer a 2.0 liter for $1950.
