Subject: Re: EV piston slap - how noticeable?

If you don't hear it when cold starting, you don't have it. It is both
noticeable and distinctive.

&gt;Y'know, I've got a 93 EV, and I'm just about certain it's *never*
&gt;made the noises that've been described in this list as symptomatic
&gt;of EV piston slap.  
&gt;
&gt;My previous two cars were both VW diesels, a rabbit and then a Jetta,
&gt;so I know and love that very, very distinctive sound.  Nope, if we're
&gt;talking about something that's *anything* like diesel clatter, I don't
&gt;think my EV's ever done that.  
&gt;
&gt;How many of 'em did?  A lot?  Most?  Mine's got almost 78,000 miles 
&gt;on it.  If it had been slapping without me noticing it all this time,
&gt;would it have blown up by now?  What happens?
&gt;
&gt;How noticable is it?  Mine has always impressed me for its 
&gt;smoothness -  even when cold.  It just starts &amp; runs smoothly.
&gt;
&gt;Somebody wrote that their dealer confirmed it with a stethoscope.
&gt;Is that what we're talking about?
&gt;
