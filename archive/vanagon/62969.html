I believe that there is a copy in jpg form in the archives.  I scanned it

&gt; Can someone tell me where I can obtain the manual for Dometic Westy

&gt; the pilot light lit, I've decided to bite the bullet and pull the sucker.
&gt; Richard Angelini has graciously sent me a detailed procedure for removing
&gt; the unit but I would like to have the official Dometic manual for the
&gt; illustrations and part numbers if required.
