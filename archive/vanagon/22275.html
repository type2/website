Subject: Re: Solex 3031 and 009: Whither Weber?


&gt;&gt; A used VW parts seller near me told me that I should replace the 34PICT3 
in
&gt;&gt; my '71 bus with a SOLEX 3031. Don't know anything about it, but he claims
&gt;&gt; it's an easy install with a kit that attaches it to the intake
&gt;&gt; manifold...will solve idling problems, increase performance, etc. ...$140
&gt;&gt; locally.

&gt; I believe that your '71 is a dual port. If so, DO NOT use the 30/31.
&gt; While these are great for single port engines, for dual ports, they have
&gt; a small adaptor plate, which really decreases the efficiency a lot,
&gt; leading often to a &quot;flat spot&quot; in your acceleration. If your 34 is fine,
&gt; keep it, if it has problems, you should go ahead and rebuild it for a
&gt; few bucks...
&gt; All IMHO of course.

Well, I once had a 1600 Dual Port engine from a '74 bug, in my
'69 bus. Mucho carb problems, so I got a new Weber 32/36 2-barrel
progressive with whole-shot manifold, from Fast Freddy's. Pulled
the engine, put them on, along with Thunderbird single quiet pack
and 009 distrubutor. Adjusted the idle-mixture (that's important),
and drove the hell out of it, in a nice way, I mean.

What a sweet setup! Lots of top end, slightly quieter than it used
to be, and driving around town in 3rd was suddenly a pleasure! Made
it seem like a real car &lt;g&gt;. No sign of the dreaded &quot;flat spot&quot;
you're supposed to get when you combine a 009 and DP engine. Are
you guys sure you didn't just imagine that?

Racers still pooh-pooh the Weber progressive. I'd imagine that it
doesn't give the b*lls-to-the-wall power that dual carbs do (don't
ask me). But the throttle drivability is wonderful. Gas mileage
went down a little (from 20 down to about 17-18), but what the hey.

Only bad news is, you'll be shot on sight if you try to get a smog
certificate for an engine set up this way. In the People's Republic
of California, anyway.

Try it, you'll like it! But keep your old carb etc., for that
biannual pilgrimmage to pay homage to the revenooers...

 -Steve Maher     smaher_at_gi_dot_com    '71 VW Transporter, still with
                                  single solex, but Baby Kadrons
                                  (used) waiting in a box!

P.S. such aftermarket carbs and manifolds, probably don't have the
big vacuum tap for your power-brake vacuum line, which was unique
to the '71 model year of the bus. I guess this may require some
machine-shop work to fabricate and install one? Anyone know of a kit
for this, or must it be scratch-built?
