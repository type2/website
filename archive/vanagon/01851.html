If you have a VANAGON diesel then you might want to give a friend of mine
a call - he converted his V. diesel to a GTI engine with CIS-E and knock
control.  He's the half owner of a large Bosch Authorized Repair facility here
in Grand Rapids - German Auto Service.  Call 1-616-555-1212 for the # and
ask for Dan (btw both the owners names are Dan so ask for the one that did
the conversion).  He should be able to give you some info.

Not sure if any of the other vanagons are convertable without major
headaches.
