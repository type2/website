Subject: Re: vanagon turbo-diesel


&gt;Steve Maher refers to my Porsche-powered Vanagon as &quot;pretty much [an]
&gt;all-VW conversion&quot; which understates the glory of the thing a good deal
&gt;but does hint at the relative ease of installing an engine that is config-
&gt;ured very much like the VW four.

Oops, Bill, I didn't mean to understate it! Sorry... I was merely pointing
out that relatively good fit you mentioned. Plus I was patronizing, just
a little, anybody who's overly stuffy about engine nationality. I do this
once a year whether there's anyone there or not.   ;)


&gt;For those of you who are looking to power up wasserboxers, here are some
&gt;fax numbers for German companies that (at least a few years ago) were
&gt;putting Ford V-6s into VWs:
&gt;ML Tuning 02823/3930
&gt;A. Winkler 02323/82374
&gt;Staubermann 02534/5166

And here's a voice phone of an American company doing the same thing:

Kennedy Engineered Products, Palmdale, CA;  805-272-1147

No connection with Kennedy except being a hand-me-down customer, who has
found nothing wrong with their conversion kit despite looking at it real
hard.
