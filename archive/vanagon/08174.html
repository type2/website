Subject: Re: Water in gas tank

&gt; Milky? That does not sound like water. As a pilot I routinely 
&gt; draw samples of gas out of tanks to check for water, and often 
&gt; see it. But it appears, in a clear container filled primarily 
&gt; with gas, on the bottom as a clear &quot;bubble&quot;, perhaps containing 
&gt; rust or other contaminants. Of the hundreds of times I have seen 
&gt; water in gasoline, it has never appeared as &quot;milky&quot;.

That had me going for a while.  When I wrote my first message asking
for help, I wasn't even sure it was water.  Since then, the sample
has settled out to what looks like gas with a dirty water bubble 
laying on the bottom.

I got the gas during the fuel pump test which has you disconnect the
fuel return hose at pressure regulator.  The gas at that point had 
already been through the pump, injector manifold, and regulator.  I
suspect the flow turbulence &quot;homogenized&quot; it.

Today I drew gas from the tank directly and it was just gas with 
a lump of dirty water in it.


&gt; you didn't, by any chance, buy that tank of gas at a 7-11?
&gt; or Zippy-Mart?

Naahh! ... I don't buy that fancy name brand stuff.  Get mine at 
a country store over by Mansfield dam.  Don't recall the name, but 
it's got a sign outside that says &quot;Best gas in Texas by a dam site&quot;
