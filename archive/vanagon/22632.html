Subject: Re: Need Eurovan Info, Piston Slap


&gt;In response to the query, I think the only thing to check for is the
&gt;excessive &quot;piston slap&quot; problem some of the earlier EVs had.  This is
&gt;very noticeable when the engine is started from a cold state -- it
&gt;sounds like a diesel engine.  Other than that, the EV seems to be a
&gt;veryreliable, powerful and utilitarian vehicle at 33,000 miles.

Regarding this &quot;piston slap&quot; problem in early Eurovans.  Do you know if
this problem was noticeable in low mileage early Eurovans or does it
develop after several thousand miles?  Was it a recall?  Was it covered
under warranty?  What were dealer responses to it?  Is this the problem
were they coated the pistons with teflon to fix it?  Was this a problem in
Europe too?
