&gt;So Thom Fitzpatrick says:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Sheesh, I'm scared to put any more time and effort into this baby - its 
&gt;&gt; going to end up being someones parts store!  100% discount!  I can see
&gt;&gt; my brand new engine and tranmission in someone else's lowered, primered
&gt;&gt; piece of shit!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;I'm real sorry this is happening to you Thom.  For as rare a vehicle as 
&gt;yours is, I'd seriously consider taken off the rotor or coil wire before
&gt;I left it out over night.  It'd be a hassle, but better than finding no
&gt;car in the morning.  Of course you could get a shotgun and sleep in it
&gt;over night, but that's pretty extreme.

I'd though about sleeping in it, just to see the look on their faces when 
they pull the tarp back and see my beadly little eyes glaring back at them!

Believe me, I was lying awake 'till the wee hours imagining dastardly
deeds to exact my revenge on the evil perpetrators!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Fools, I'll destroy them all!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

&quot;they're coming to take me away ha ha ho ho he he ha ha
to the funny farm, where life is beautiful all the time
and I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats
ans they're coming to take me away ha ha!&quot;
