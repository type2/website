Subject: 87GL A/C Condensate Drain Tube ?

Volks,
Have seen posts on A/C condensate hose probs. My condensate hose just
goes through the sheet metal and into the RH rear intake at the top. The
tube is very short, only say 4 inches long, forcing the water to fall
from the end of the tube some 4 feet to the bottom of the air intake
chamber) Apparently it just drops the water down into the area at the
bottom of the RH air intake (which is completely closed off from the
engine compartment, and remains, I guess, from the old air cooled days)
and somehow the water puddling in the bottom of this chamber finds it's
way out around the air intake snorkel in the chamber and to the ground.
I am considering adding some length of plastic tubing, cutting a hole in
the bottom of the RH air intake chamber and giving the condensate a free
run out of the vehicle, instead of allowing to slosh in the bottom of
this chamber. Anyone know anything about this. I remember someone
mentioning something about the factory system causing seam rust and I
could understand this. Any feedback appreciated.
Regards
