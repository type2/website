Subject: My first Junkyard score

Headed out with my father in law yesterday hoping to find a Winshield 
washer bottle for my 76 westy.  Went to the local U pick your Part type 
place not figuring on finding anything and found 4 busses there.  2 had 
been there for a while and were pretty picked over.

Found the bottle but also found in the storage cabinet in one of them 
the bars for the front hammock!!  Alll the hardware was also there so I 
pulled that as well.

One of the busses was pretty old with the straight up pop top--I forget 
the year, but the canvas is in fair shape only a few rips and hardware 
looks good.  If anyone is interested E-mail me for info.

PS---Does anyone know where to get the fabric for the hammock???

I am really happy---now the westy can sleep 4 and a youngin.

Joe
