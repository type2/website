Subject: WEsty Manualzzz

Hey the more Westy manual the merrier!!! If people want to swap manuals
with me I can send them a copy of what I have unfortunately the manual is
not 100% complete, but the majority of info is there :)! If people want to
swap me, please their Wsty manual's to;

Michael Heron
116 Lawlor Avenue
Toronto, Ontario
M4E 3L7
Canada


&gt; Michael Heron suggests:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Pat, Joe ( and all other Westy manual owners):
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; why don't we pool our resources, and make copies of our manuals, and trade
&gt;&gt; with each other. In my humble (as compared to Joel's) data summarizing
&gt;&gt; skills I surmize the following manuals are currently owned by the following
&gt;&gt; subscribers
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Pat Walsh- 78' Westy manual
&gt;&gt; Joe Clark- 68'-72' Westy Manual
&gt;&gt; Michael Heron- 1967 Westy Manual (approx. 40 pages tres detailed)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; i like seeing Westy manuals from all years :):)

&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; If I will avoid becoming a casualty of a flamewar, I can offer copies of the
&gt; original Westfalia manual that came with my '74. All the photos are in black
&gt; and white so no-one will have to endure the overpowering ORANGE of the
&gt; curtains and upholstery!
&gt;
&gt; '74 and '75 campers are unique, and after seeing the manuals I am sure you
&gt; will all want one and, lucky for you, a pristine and complete interior
&gt; should be available soon from a certain Sami Dakhlia who is *allowing* his
&gt; lovely bus to be rusted away in an uninhabitable part of the country. Whew.
