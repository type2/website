&gt;Rust, Heck!  Move to Arizona!  No, the real enemy is entropy, and
&gt;I know of no cure.

Uh, living in Arizona is no solution either, it just takes longer to
happen here.  I've been trying to get my roof replaced since November,
and it just won't stop raining so they can do it.  :-(

In the past couple of years, some cancer has appeared in the 
side panels of the bus.  I guess when I start to lose things thru
the holes I'll have to fix them :-)   Anyway, I have living proof that
cars will rust without salt on the roads.
