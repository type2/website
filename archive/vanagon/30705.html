Subject: RE: Can I replace my back seats of 84 van with newer seats?

... Fred asks.
Yes, I'm pretty sure.  I have later seats, from the &quot;velour years&quot; in my
81 Vanagon.  Middle seat is a no muss, no fuss, slide out, slide in
replacement.  Rear seat (kind that folds up into two thirds of a bed) also
fit, but:  mounting points for the seat-back supports are in a different
spot between 81 and 8x, so my back seat can't latch and is held in the
right vertical position only by its hinges and the engine deck.  Not a
problem unless you do 0-60 in 5 seconds with football players in the
back seat, but I'm still trying to figure a clean-looking fix.  Note also
that the seat-belts changed in there somewhere too.  You want the later
ones, because they have foot-long shields for the outboard belts, where
the hinge-works of the folding bed will be going by from time to time.

Good luck shopping!
B.
