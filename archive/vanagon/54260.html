&gt; Hey all,
&gt; I've got the cables to my heater flapper boxes working sorta well but they
&gt; don't like it when I move the lever only because I've got them rigged up
&gt; because the adjustment bolts/hardware (not sure what exactly goes there) is
&gt; missing.  
&gt; 
&gt; In the spring I plan on replacing the cables so let me ask a couple
&gt; questions:  

I haven't done this particular job, but I've thought about it and looked 
it up in Bentley/Haynes, and I have a feeling it's a PITA.  If you do the 
job, please post your insights/revelations here.

If the cables and levers are basically OK (it's hard to understand how 
they could go very wrong) I'd start scouring the junkyards to see if you 
couldn't scrounge up the hardware.  It might be easier and more fun!!
