Subject: Re: Opinions on later models (vanagon/EV)

&gt;For those of you with '82+ vanagons and EV's, 
&gt;
&gt;I have a friend who has asked my opinion of VW's for his needs.  They are:
&gt;
&gt;Salesman. (his territory covers Miami to New Orleans to Raleigh/Durham)
&gt;
&gt;High-mileage driver (55K+ per year)

 Well, he can get a Mercedes Station Wagon with the lifetime warranty.
Reliable, roomy, a/c, all the ammenities and the price tag OR a pick up
truck (heavy duty). And this is no joke. The amount of mileage is horrible
on a 4 cylinder VW van (whatever the model). Another possibility is to lease
a vehicle.

 I changed my mind. Tell him to buy a 67 Westfalia, put the 55K miles on it
and when it brakes down, I'll buy it from him cheap. That's no joke either.
