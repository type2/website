&gt; Hi!
&gt; 
&gt; I'm collecting Vw stories for a book. I wish to write about interesting
&gt; experiences people have had in or with a VW.
&gt; 
&gt; I would love pictures to accompany the story. Be sure to ask people to
&gt; identify anyone in the pictures. Also to give me permission to use the
&gt; stories and pictures.
&gt; 
&gt; Could you put out the word? I would really appreciate it.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, do you have any interesting information that you could send me on the
&gt; history of the VW?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your help.  We have to keep the legend alive.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; P.S. I have a restored 79 convertible.
