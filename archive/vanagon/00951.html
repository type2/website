Subject: Re:  fuel inlet pulls out of Solex carb! how to fix?

&gt; 
&gt; Gentlefolk,
&gt; 
&gt; My girlfriend took George, my recently aquired 1973 campmobile
&gt; to Phoenix yesterday only to have a problem with the fuel inlet
&gt; pipe on one of the two Solex carbs pull out.  She now has it
&gt; epoxyed back in place and will try driving home today
&gt;

Hmmm....perhaps you could peen the material around the fitting with a
small punch and hammer?
