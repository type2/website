Subject: Kombi Problems!!!

I have a 72 Kombi.

I put an 88 kit through it (barrels and pistons and new heads) what else
should be changed???

I have a problem with rattles too.  I'm not sure if the tappets (//) need
adjusting or judt the timing.  Could it just be timing?  It was lacking
power, but I changed the position of the distributor to where I rememberd by
sight and it improved heaps.  I suppose I need a timing light to get it
exact, but was wondering if that could cause the rattling.

Thanks in advance.

Tracey
