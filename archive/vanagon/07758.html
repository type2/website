Subject: more clutch troubles

Hey all,

On my friend's 78 bus, is it safe to assume that when I engage 1st and 2nd 
gears and a high pitched whining, spinning and grinding noise sounds from 
where the clutch plate is that I need to drop the engine to replace a $9 
pilot bearing ?  There is no problem getting the bus into any gears but 
suspect in the near miles there will be.  Did I mention that the clutch was 
replaced in late Spring of this year.  Just would like your all's consensus 
before I take it down to the shop.  I guess that since the engine will be out 
it would be a good idea some cashish and do some preventive maintenance.
                                  
and while I'm taking up bandwidth would anyone have either a rebuilt or a 
good used steering gearbox for a 70 bus that they would willing to part with.
I'm going to pull mine off soon and expect the worse when I take it apart.

private mails would be ok, thanks

john 70 bus and caring for another
