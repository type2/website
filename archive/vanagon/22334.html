Joel, et al ...

I may not have been able to post this on Friday as my contributon so don't read this 
until then and think about me sometme.


The following were composed by Marte Brengle 76703,4242 [on COMP-U-SERVE]

If you have a problem with the sentiments expressed talk to her
I am just the messenger.

Submitting this for a bit of humor in an otherwise humorless world.
===============================================================
1)
Bush Song     (to the tune of &quot;Hello Dolly&quot;)

  Goodbye, Georgie, yes goodbye, Georgie,
  It's such fun to watch you bumble on TV.
  You look like h*ll, Georgie,
  We can tell, Georgie
  That back home in Kennebunkport's where you're gonna be.
  We hear the swell growing
  For your out-going;
  Pack your bags and pick up Millie at the door,
  OH!  Golly gee, Georgie,
  Put on your sneaks and flee, Georgie,
  You can't get elected any more!


2)
Clinton Song  (to the tune of &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird&quot;)

  Look back twenty years or so,
  Where'd he go, who'd he know?
  Where was Clinton?
  Were there bimbos in his bed?
  Were they Red?  Were they dead?
  Where was Clinton?

  No Republican would be so dotty,
  Flushing stems and Zig-Zags down the potty...

  Get the dirt from Georgie B!
  Constantly.  Duty free.
  Where was Clinton?
  Never mind the world today,
  Get that file from CIA!
  Where was Clinton?

  Dornan, Dole and Baker got together;
  Bill and Trotsky must be of a feather!

  Pack up all your cares and woe,
  Flying low, there they go,
  Clinton?  Who's he?


3)
Perot Song    (to the tune of &quot;Yellow Rose of Texas&quot;)

  There's a little guy from Texas
  Who's talking on TV;
  An oversized chihuhahua
  Is what he seems to be.
  He said he drew those pictures
  And numbers on the chart,
  So good ole boys and rednecks
  Will think Perot looks smart.

  He produced this infomercial
  That we have come to see;
  He's got five billion dollars
  So he's just like you and me.
  Watch him flourish with the pointer;
  He hopes with all his heart
  That the guys who build the rockets
  Will think Ross Perot looks smart.

  He's bought all these half-an-hours
  Of time on NBC,
  So we can't watch Fred and Wilma,
  Who's the Boss or Mr. T.
  So we've found this revelation
  And we've taken it to heart:
  We know compared to Gilligan
  Ole Ross Perot looks smart.


4)
Don and Mme. P Song  (to the tune of &quot;Happy Days Are Here Again&quot;)

 Vote for Don and Mme P!
 The candidates for you and me!
 DUMP the other two, or is it three?
 Vote for Don and Mme P!

 Vote for Mme P and Don!
 They're the two who'll really turn things on!
 All our doom and gloom will soon be gone!
 Vote for Mme P and Don!

 Vote for Don and Mme P!
 She predicts November victory!
 Come on, CompuServe community,
 Vote for Don and Mme P!

 Vote for Mme P and Don!
 Every Harry, Martha, Jane and John!
 Zack the Dog says they will get it on!
 Vote for Mme P and Don!

 Vote for Don and Mme P!
 They will make election history!
 Pull the switch for them November three!
 Vote for Don and Mme P!


5)
ONE MORE TIME!!!!!   (to the tune of &quot;Hello, Dolly&quot;)

  Goodbye, Georgie, yes goodbye, Georgie,
  It was fun to see you bumble on TV.
  You looked like hell, Georgie,
  We could tell, Georgie,
  That back home in Kennebunkport's where you're gonna be.
  We saw the swell growing
  For your out-going;
  Pack your bags and pick up Millie at the door,
  OH! Golly gee, Georgie,
  Put on your sneaks and flee, Georgie,
  You can't get elected any more!

  So say goodbye, Georgie, yes goodbye, Georgie!
  Are you sorry now you've trashed the GOP?
  Your tactics smelled, Georgie,
  You got shelled, Georgie,
  Which just proves that things worked out the way they oughta be!
  We hear the band playing
  For your not-staying,
  Start your new hotel-room life in '93,
  OH! Hidy ho, Georgie,
  Pack up the van and go, Georgie,
  Clinton's won a glorious victory!
