Subject: fuel leak (?) &amp; odometer

I remember a thread a couple of weeks ago about someone having fuel leaking.
We were about to take a 160 mile trip in my '85 Westy yesterday and filled
the tank.  When I returned from paying for the gasoline, I noticed a puddle,
on the ground, underneath the driver's seat.  The smell was very much like
gasoline.  

Peered at the wheel well and noticed two small (about 1/2 in. OD) hoses
saturated and dripping.  Since we had only gone 40 of the 160 miles, we
turned around and switched vehicles.

When we got back to the house, the hoses appeared to be mostly dry.  Parked
the vehicle outside as a precaution while we were gone for the weekend.
This evening, no sign of dripping (haven't moved or started the vehicle
since yesterday morning).

Also, I noticed (before filling the tank) that the odometer had suddenly
stopped.  The speedometer works fine, but not the odometer or trip meter.
Our '86 Jetta has the same problem.

Any help on these two would be greatly appreciated.
