Subject: Re: Rear cargo door seal for '71 bus


##Steve Maher       smaher_at_ball_dot_com             '71 Transporter
##The seal around the rear cargo door (not the engine hatch) of my '71 bus
##is pretty well shot. Replacements are around $70-$80 by mail order-- ouch!
##Does anyone know of any workable substitutes? Need not be exact original,

I strongly recommend biting the old financial bullet on this one.  I had 
a really bad leak on my '70 Kombi rear hatch seal--it let rain _and_ 
exhaust fumes in.  

So I replaced it, applying some gnarly black sealant, too.  No more 
rain/fumes.  

Yeah, the cost is a real bite; HOWEVER, the job is really easy, a 
possible saving grace.
