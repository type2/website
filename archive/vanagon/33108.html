I'll ask my uncle at Folsom prison... :)

(Background of the joke:  several years a go I went to a state of CA
&quot;career day&quot; and the dept of corrections display was a bunch of license
plates that the, uh, &quot;residents&quot; had made and tried to smuggle out.
Lots of interesting, &quot;non-standard&quot; plates, ie 9 letters, 7 words 
you wouldn't say on TV.  And he's not really my uncle...)
