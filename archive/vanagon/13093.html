&gt;&gt;difference, if you want to know the truth!), you are supposed to put the car
&gt;&gt;in reverse, and back up at about 5-10 mph, then hit the brakes really hard.
&gt;&gt;do this about three times, and that's an &quot;adjustment&quot;.

Joel:

I think I finally see a mistake in your postings...

I just had my brake shoes replaced and I studied real hard (just like when
I was a student before finals) to figure out how the rear brakes self adjust.
It turned out that whenever you pull up parking brake it will turn the
starwheels if the brake shoes aren't tight. If the shoes are tight already
and the prking brake is still too loose then adjust the cable underneath the
van. It might take a dozen or two pullings of the parking brake to get the shoes
tight.
