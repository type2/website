Howdy Volks...

How often should i take our &quot;new&quot; used EV out to keep it in good running
order?

Sitting for a week seems okay, but how about two, three, etc?
When does sitting become bad?

We are trying to perserve our van for as long as possible and use it only for 
trips.

Thanks, 

Marion and Chris
EV 1995
