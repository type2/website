Subject: Query on 80 Vanagon price

Any suggestions as to what the following vehicle is worth:

1980 Vanagon Camper (VSI conversion: Dometic fridge, Coleman furnace,
propane stove, sink with hand &amp; electric pump, pop top, lots of storage
space)
97,000 miles (22K of which are on a rebuild)
Body is clean, minor dent in the door, and sliding door lower half has been
replaced;
full VDO instrumentation package (lovingly installed by current owner);
engine seems to run fine, but is definitely a bit hotter than ideal. I
haven't diagnosed this one yet.

I'm particularly interested in hearing from folks in the PNW. But if anyone
has an opinion I'd like to hear about it.

I haven't decided to sell it yet, but I keep test driving water-cooled ones
and I'm starting to get used to that extra power. But I'm wondering just
how big a loss I'd be taking on my current one. The VW mechanic I took it
to for a look at the overheating problem ended up getting E. coli poisoning
(well, it's suspected at least) so I don't know yet why yet. And I sure
haven't had time lately to spend a day in the garage.
