&gt; I've got a short somewhere in my 89 Westy.   I've put in a
&gt; new battery, thinking that this was the problem, but by the battery
&gt; indicator, and lack of starting power after just a couple of days, I know
&gt; that there must be a short somewhere...

The fact that the battery was flat after two days may indicate a short but
it also may indicate charging problems.  Does the charge indicator light
come on when the ignition is switched on and does it go out after the
engine starts?   If the red light stays on there are charging problems - if
you are not well up on auto electrics find a mate who is or alternatively
find a reliable auto electrician.

To check for a short, first switch off  all electrical accessories i.e. the
ignition, lights, radio, car alarm etc. Disconnect the battery at the
ground (negative) terminal and then run a wire from the negative terminal
to outside the van.  Touch the end of the wire to bare metal on the chassis
and look for a spark (easier to see at night) BTW the easier method of
touching the earth strap to the battery negative carries a slight chance
exploding the explosive gas mix which can be present in the battery
compartment. If you get a big spark once again check that all electrical
accessories are off including door courtesy lights.  If you get a small
weak spark that may be from the clock.

Set your multimeter to a high  ampere range (10 amps) leaving all the
accessories switched off .

Then connect your multimeter in series,  the negative terminal of the
m/meter to the wire you attached to the -ve battery terminal and the +ve
m/meter terminal to bare metal on the chassis.  Note the reading.  Switch
to a lower range until you get a clear reading.

It should be around 20 milliamps (clock current).  If it's higher go to the
fuse box and take out fuse #1 and check the amperage on the m/meter (a
leakage of 1 amp can discharge a battery in under two days ( 1ampx48 hours
=  48 ampere-hours)).  Continue to pull out fuses until you find that
pulling the one  that drops the current down to a few milliamps  - that's
the circuit which is causing your problemp.  You'll then need to follow the
circuit through to find where it's shorting.  Bentley gives circuit
diagrams and is fairly explicit but takes some studying.



Best of luck with your search
