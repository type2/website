&gt;Darn those pesky progressives!  The English language should have stayed
&gt;the same once Beowulf came out.  Those durned Normans had no respect for
&gt;'traditional values'!    Smite them! Smite them all!
&gt;
&gt;By the way, how would Grendel say:
&gt;I just bought a '71 Westfalia, and I love her!  Anybody got a spare rear
&gt;bumper bracket?


Grendel would simply munch anyone who complained.
Ahh, the good old days...   :^)
