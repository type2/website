Subject: Re: 1958 VW Microbus - Rebuilt stock drivetrain $1500 OBO (fwd)

I think I saw this bus.  once,   if it is painted slightly off the mango
green / seagull grey original.   the one i saw looked really nice - the
interior was redone close to the original too.  

actually no - that was a 59-61 bus, by the bumpers  hmm -    where is it
hiding?  Oly is NOT a big town
