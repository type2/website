Subject: Which bones are best? ('82 Vanagon) /long

Went to pick up the &quot;new&quot; gas tank yesterday.  Nice, no rust, full of gas 
(which went into the yard man's pickup), and only $50 (compared to the 
dealer price of $750 for new).  Took a look at the donor Vanagon ('82).  
It was an 'L' (or 'GL'?) model with the same interior as my '81 'L'.  Why 
this Bus is in a bone yard is beyond me.  It has, however, motivated me 
to keep my Vanagon and &quot;restore&quot; it.  I'm buying all the seats (perfect  
brown checkered cloth, captains chairs) for $50, the totally rust free 
side door ($100), rear hatch ($50), rear bumper ($50) and will also pick 
up a few other pieces (grill, front bumper trim, etc.).  I think these 
prices are good, so I'm tempted to pick up some of the mechanical pieces 
also.  The yard boss said that the PO tried to convert the FI to carbs 
and &quot;screwed something up&quot;.  What pieces should I try to buy and how can 
I be assured that they are usable?  The motor in my Vanagon has 150K (new 
heads at 100K) and is bound to need some of those pricey FI components 
eventually.  I'd try to buy the whole Bus, but I have too damn many whole 
Busses as it is.

Any help would be appreciated.
