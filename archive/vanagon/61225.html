Subject: Watch sears mechanics!!!

Here is my mechanic watching story: I went to sears to get some tires on my
87 syncro with alloy wheels. I watched them take off the wheels, mount 3 new
tires before I thought they knew what they were doing and went off to look
at some tools.

When I got back, they had all 4 tires mounted on the wheels and on the car.
But one lug was not chrome. A closer look, a universal replacment nut. The
tire monkey had dropped a nut down the jack hole in the floor. They said
&quot;don't worry, we will order a new one, it will be here in about a week&quot; In
my loudest most &quot;get this done you idiot&quot; voice I said&quot; YOU WILL TAKE APART
THE JACK AND FISH OUT MY NUT WITH A MAGNET&quot; I had to say this again to the
manager. They did it and found lots of other cars nuts along with my nut.
Nut on drive home. Hey, did the tire maggot get the pressure right, I
thought. It is printed on the door jamb sticker. They can read? Check the
pressure, sure its wrong, AND THEY MANAGED TO PUT 185 TIRES ON THE FRONT AND
205'S ON THE BACK on a syncro that must have all sizes the same or the VC
will self distruct. Went back, got the right size tires. never even consider
about thinking of going to sears again.
