Subject: AH...why didn't i check the air filter? (and others...)

hey now,

i took the air filter outta my 74' transporter yesterday...yuck! it was dirty
and looked clogged. accordding to muir, i should have the paper filters but
it's a steel type filter...and i should have dual carbs but it's been modified
to a singe carb...go figure. so i was going to try and just replace the air
filter but haven't had any luck finding one that looks like this. going to go
by the local vw parts place and see what i can find. okay, muir says to fill
the plate with oil when you replace the filter...in the pre 74 w/the steel
filters i would assumbe you do this. BUT,  i don't see how i can do this.
see, the filter sits around the intake, the cap goes on top, and it clips to
the base of the carb. the filter actually makes the walls of the structure.
no where to put oil. i would love to talk to the ppo who did all this
modification.

IF i can't find a new filter, i can just clean this one of right? i've heard
of letting it  soak in mineral spirits or gasoline. opinions? advice?

i've got some carb/choke cleaner spray and i'm going to clean up the carb after
work. accordding to the directions, with the engine off, i spray everywhere
except in the intake. then with the engine on, i spray in the intake. is this
correct?

then i'm going to see if i can adjust the carb. i'm hoping that the clogged
air filter is part of the reason i'm getting lousy gas milage. also going to
change the fuel filter again.

one more question: there's a thick hose leading from the carb down to a box
that is rectangular with a bar across it. looks like you pull the bar down and
then take off the lid. what is this? is this the vacuum hose? should i check
whatever is inside this box? hehehe

thanks,

jonathan
