I don't believe that that is a good idea.  I'm not as sure about the 
cooler seat, but our owner's manual seemed to say only the rear bench or 
front passenger seat.  We have always used the center of the bench as the 
seat belts are the non-retractable kind with out the shoulder belt.  The 
bench is wide enough that our teenagers are fine sitting beside the baby.
