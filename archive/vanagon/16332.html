&gt; 	Folks,
&gt; 	Someone was kind enough to send me the Canadian 800 number for
&gt; Eastwood Canada, but I can't use it from California. 800 directory assistance
&gt; didn't have a number for Eastwood that resulted in a car parts and accessories
&gt; place, so I'm stuck. I shouldn't have recycled their catalog!
&gt; 	Does anyone out there have the USA 800 number for Eastwood, or
&gt; their regular number for that matter?
&gt; 
&gt; 	Ian and I put the new master cyclinder into Little Martha last night
&gt; and came upon that age-old question: Bolt the cylinder to the mount FIRST
&gt; and then attach the brake lines, or attach the brake lines FIRST and then
&gt; bolt the cylinder to the mount? One wants to NOT use the mass and leverage
&gt; of the cylinder to bend/break/weaken the brake lines, natch. So we started
&gt; with the cylinder bolted firmly to mount, and attached the aft brake line.
&gt; The forward line couldn't be threaded in at that angle, however. So Ian
&gt; let me, the owner and prospective user, make the decision and I slacked off
&gt; the mounting bolts, lined up and attached the forward brake line and then
&gt; tightened up the mounting bolts. So we did one each way. It looked
&gt; really nice all finished in there and all. Flush and bleed soon!
