The 2L rebuild isn't doing too good. It kind of starts up, but idles really
bad, if you try and give it gas it doesn't respond. I had put in new P's &amp;
C's, rebuilt heads (Mark Stephens), that's it. I just made sure the valves
were adjusted properly and statically set the timing to get me in the
ballpark. The timing was set at about 24BTDC, so I re-set it to 7.5BTDC.
There's also a hissing sound coming from the left side of the engine, sound
like up from the top half, as I give it a little gas it decreases so I
would think it might be some sort of vacuum line?

Anyways, I'm not quite sure what to do at this point, other than call in a
tow truck and bring it in to a mechanic which is a very disheartning
thought. I'm pretty sure everything is hooked up properly, except there's
still one thin black wire coming through the right front of the engine
compartment with the larger harness about 5 inches long that I don't know
where it hooks up to. If anyone has any ideas I'd love to hear em,
otherwise I'll probably take it in:(
