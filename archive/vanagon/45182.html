&gt; I believe that your Vanagon, like many 10-year-old busses, suffers from
&gt; &quot;rear end sag&quot;.  This is especially profound in the Westfalia camper model.

&gt; I have an old issue of HotVW's magazine that describes a procedure for
&gt; raising the rear end back up where it's supposed to be.  Basically, you &quot;wind&quot;
&gt; the trailing arms of the rear suspension.  Email me for details.

Vanagon rear suspension does not have the same trailing arm arrangement.
