Nate and to all those thinking about the long run,

I've done it, I've had a VW/remanufactured engine put into my '86.
It's expensive but if you can get a small loan, as I did, I would
recommend it. I plan to keep my van for at least ten years to 
off set the cost which was $4700, DOO!!! This was about $1000 over
the initial estimate. The cost was driven up because I needed both
the front and rear exhaust pipes as well as the junction/manifold
that that they bolt into. The engine was only $2475, but the labor
$750, taxes $260, clutch, water pump, exhaust pipes, hoses, clamps
oil/antifreeze/trans oil and other odd parts all added up. It came
with a 12 month/12,000 mile warrenty. I'm getting over the sticker 
shock and have begun to enjoy the new engine.

It does run much more smoothly and sounds a lot better than the old
engine. Is it worth the money, like I said, I plan to keep this van
for at least ten years, maybe longer so the cost per year won't be
too much. I had planned on nursing the old engine along until it died,
but I severely bent the exhaust system which pushed me into this
decision. I use the van for long road trips, so reliable and dependable
transportation was a factor also. The tired, ten year old, coolant 
dripping engine had done it's job, for how much longer who knows?

By taking control of the situation I was able to order the engine,
set up an appointment to have it installed and was able to drive to
the shop. It took them three days to do the work. Helmut Hoyer's 
in Allentown PA did the it, old German guy and son team, shop clean
enough to eat off the floor, they did it right, no problems so far. 
I preferred this situation to being some 500 miles from home, the 
head gasket fails and then have some shop I don't know work on it.

Well I hope this helps you in your decision,
