Hello all,
Several days ago, someone posted a note saying that they had put plastic 
between the front and the back to keep warm.  This gave me an idea which
I did try tonight.  If you take an old blanket and place it over the 
headrests of the driver and passenger seat, with just a little dip
between the seats, the front part of the camper does seem to be
significantly warmer while driving.  The temperature outside is on the
order of 5 degrees tonight (that is F) and the difference is quite apparent.
