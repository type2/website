Subject: re: EV piston EV Piston Slap 

K&amp;C,

Well, I'm in the same boat as you.  I have 800 miles left on my EV's 50K
powertrain warranty, and I want(NEED!) a EV-competent VW dealer meachanic to 
verify that the engine does or does not suffer from piston slap.  I think it
does, but the dealers close to me don't have a clue about anything to do 
with the EV.  Since it's only audible on a COLD engine, I'd have to leave it
overnight, which restricts me taking it to a dealer very far from home (if I
can locate one). 

So, my question is: did anyone facing this call VW first and ask them for 
acknowledgement on EV piston slap, and, if so, where they able to direct 
the dealer on diagnosing it?  I'm expecting VoA isn't of much help...

Thanks,
rob
