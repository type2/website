&gt; How well does a Syncro Westy fare on sand dunes?  We have a pretty good
&gt; set of dunes on the west side of Michigan (Silver Lake, Sleeping Bear,

Hi Paul,

Check out http://www.islandnet_dot_com/~swright/vwimages.html for a Syncro Picture 
in the Dunes.  Shawn was able to host some pictures scanned from a Syncro 
brochure.  I found the brochure, Harry Yates did the scanning and now Shawn did 
the Web hosting.  Does this list get along or what!!!  We have now solved World 
Peace.  What's next , World Humger???  :-)  Is it Friday Yet?

There is also a picture of the much talked about, but never seen Tri-Star 
Syncro.  My apologies to Shawn if his Web hit count goes throught the roof!!

Cheers
Tony

&gt; Best Regards,
