I ordered it from VW Heritage Parts Centre, Unit 5, Freeman's Road,
Portslade, Sussex BN41 1SL, UK. Tel: (0044) 1273 424330. It was GB#4 plus
postage plus VAT.

It has over 160 pages (on the last page it even shows the little bag
containing the jack, wheel wrench and a couple of hand tools). I have not
quite worked out the system but I think you quote the page number and then
the part number which is arrowed on each part on the page.

I think it is the same thing that the VW main dealers have on microfiche
when you go into the parts centre.

&gt; &gt;At long last the VW Parts Catalogue &quot;Type 2 Mod: 1980 - 1985&quot; that I
&gt; &gt;ordered from VW Heritage has arrived.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Please tell--where do I order it?  Thanks--
