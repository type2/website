&gt;Qustion to all eagle eyes:
&gt;(Before anybody flies to SA) Did you notice that the SA rear windows are
&gt;bigger than the regular Vanagon and Transporter ones ?
&gt;But I feel to remember to have seen Campers with rear side sliding windows
&gt;pver here, don't know if stock or aftermarket.

In Germany you will get plastic double screened rear slide windows for our
Vanagon style body. But we had this thread already, the SA body gets bigger
middle and rear windows and is missing the small dent just below the window.
