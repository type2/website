Subject: Re: 70's camper engine questions from a potential newbie


&gt;1.  can an earlier stand-up engine be fit into a later pancake
&gt;equipped bus.  i understand from digging around the net and the list
&gt;archives that they are much cheaper

This is exactly the kind of thing I would do. It's probably unwise in the
end. I believe it's also a Federal crime and you'll never, ever pass an
inspection.

&gt;2. can the rear welded apron be modified to a bolt on like the '71 and
&gt;prior to expedite maintenance when the engine needs to be pulled

Somebdy else asked that once and I don't think there was an answer. One
person call pull the engine on a 68-71 with nothing but a few box wrenches,
several bricks and a piece of rope. It's great.

&gt;3. i'm told mexico and south runs on old vw's..  i would love to spend
&gt;much time there in mine on a student budget.. i am thinking there
&gt;would be no problem getting parts/repair for the standup engine .. is
&gt;there much use of the pancake engine there though...

Get an upright for this.

&gt;4. any general thoughts on the pancake vs. stand up engines..  costs
&gt;vs. power or reliability.. whatever.. i'm easy to interest.

I'd say it but I already got flamed once. ;) I think you can't beat a 1600 DP.

&gt;p.s.  did any of the model yrs have front seat that could swivel
&gt;toward the rear?  when?  could they be retrofit? or did all yr.
&gt;campers have the &quot;wall&quot; behind the front seats?

They all have a bulkhead behind the seat. A swivel seat would be a huge
problem to install. You'll end up with a walk-through, and it amounts to
pretty much the same thing if you don't fill the space between the seats up
with trash from MacDonald's. ;)

Get a 68-71. 71 Is the best for the front discs. It was a huge year for VW,
they sold a lot of 71s, so they're not rare.
