&gt; the &lt;subscribe&gt; &lt;Ford-list-name&gt; command to .
&gt; 
&gt; I am really a cool guy, I do all the work on my vehicles (except for 
&gt; foundry and machine shop stuff)  I also have answered help requests on 
&gt; this VW Van list.  
&gt; 
&gt; Really it is okay to own a Ford.  (just nobody throws you peace signs)

I should know.  =)  If you can do WWW take a look at my Fordnatics home
page at http://www.teleport_dot_com/~des/fordnatics.  Failing that, send
mail to fordnatics-request_at_best_dot_com.  There are a few of us (at least
4) on the list that have both Fords and VWs.  I don't think it's a bad
thing...
