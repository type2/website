&gt; Does anyone know any precedent for such a parts 
&gt;cop-op?

This has long been a custom in the aviation community, even including spare
engines.  Usually the aircraft manufacturer oversees the system but the
custom is universal, observed by airlines and owners of same-type aircraft.

Two points:  The parts being shipped (usually special tools, in the case of
aircraft), travel in custom-built reusable containers permanently marked with
their custodians address.

Second point:  There's always someone who tries to outwit the system,
expecting to walk away with a batch of new parts.  With aircraft, there is a
different body of laws and ways to handle such cases.  I don't know of any
way to fully protect such a system involving automobiles.
