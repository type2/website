&gt; Optima Deep Cycle Battery (not gel, new spiral wound technology)
&gt;  52 amp hours
&gt;  700 or 750 cranking amps
&gt;  Sealed -- no gases
&gt;  Can be charged harder than gels without risk of frying
&gt;  Also expensive ($160-$180)
&gt;  
&gt;  Fits under seat but is a little too tall -- however comes with side and
top
&gt;  terminals, so I am going to use the side terms and drill holes in the
black
&gt;  access cover (and carpet) for the top terminals -- the access cover then
&gt;  closes.  Top terminals come with plastic caps and will stick up through
the
&gt;  carpet (but not so high that the driver's seat won't swivel).  They will
be
&gt;  out of harms way when driving, and if I need to jump-start someone I can 
&gt; just
&gt;  slide the seat forward a bit and take off the plastic caps.

STOP!!!!!!!!  Don't drill or cut anything.  You don't need to.  
Just install the Optima battery on it's side with the &quot;top&quot; posts facing the
front of the van.  It fits fine this way.
