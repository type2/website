Subject: Re: Performance Decisions

&gt;I put this to you::::::: Ramona and I are about to embark on a
&gt;cross-country voyage to Colorado where we will live in rust-free harmony for
&gt;the immediate future. Ramona needs upgrading before the onset of serious
&gt;travel and I've obtained a Bus Stop catalog from Rocky Mtn. Motorworks. Is
&gt;this a good co. to deal with? (I realize I just opened up a can of worms
&gt;there...) In shopping for a new long-block engine, how do theirs compare to
&gt;others? The two choices I have are the stock 1600cc remanufactured and the
&gt;&quot;high performance&quot; 1641cc for slightly more bread. How much more power does
&gt;the 1641cc offer in comparison to the stock?? What are the pros and cons of
&gt;either??? Do I also have to buy an engine installation kit to put it in?
&gt;What's the best way to go here? I wanna be sure she'll have enough power to
&gt;tow a small trailer and my camping gear. Also, how do I check to see if my
&gt;oil cooler is in good shape? Engine out?? How does one tell if it's shot?
&gt;    Anyways, I really need some fast advice here! This trek came up sooner
&gt;than I'd anticipated and I need to get the ball in motion! Any towing hints
&gt;would be apprecitaed too! How well do these puppies pull?     Thanks! Rach

Hi Rach,

Many theories abound, wanna hear some..............

Here are some recommendations for a VW bus engine;

Required;
A NEW AS21 MATERIAL CASE, don't let anyone sell you a bored out case, you'll
never get the oil pressure you should.  I have a new case and it has 18 psi
oil pressure with 20W non-detergent oil, idling (800 rpm), at operating
temperature (180 degrees F+).

Lower the compression to 6.8:1, either with shims under the barrels
(.040&quot;-.060&quot;) or something like Gene Bergs semi-hemi cut heads.

Heavy Duty single valve springs, shimmed under the spring.

Double-thrust camshaft bearing.

There are many other modifications also;
I would not recommend the 1641 bore size because the cylinder material is
thinner and will likely run hotter, though if you do want the extra umph,
(it ain't that much) make sure they keep the compression down.  You'd get as
much or more power with high lift rockers and/or dual carbs, which require
the heavy duty valve spring.  This combination works really well, but you
need to keep the rev's down cetainly under 5000rpm or then you should get
the counter-weighted crank, a step most people should not find neccessary.  

How well do they pull?  Not very well, it take alot of performance
modifications to up the power in the VW engine and unless it is very well
planned, will likely result in earlier failure.

If the installation kit includes stuff like a clutch and pressure plate,
muffler clamps, etc. I should think go for it.  It should add life towards
your next engine pull.

I cleaned my oil cooler with hot water, a wire brush and detergent in the
laundry sink and blew it out really well with air.  I you have an external
cooler/filter, always put the cooler before the filter so the filter has a
chance to remove gunk from the cooler.

I have no experience with the Bus Stop.

Eug,
