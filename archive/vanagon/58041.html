Subject: Re: 82 Vanagon gear selection problem.
Date: Sat, 5 Apr 1997 02:47:19 +0200 (MET DST)

&gt; &gt;When i select 1st gear i get 3rd gear and when i select 3rd gear i get
&gt; &gt;3rd gear. 2nd, 4th and reverse works ok.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Is it a linkage problem or is the gearbox broken ?
&gt; 
&gt; yup, linkage. but first crawl underneath and completely clean off the old
&gt; grease and dirt from all parts of the linkage including in the box at the
&gt; bottom of the gear lever.  This may require some dissassembly. Note the
&gt; position of pieces. Then grease heavily with molybdenum based waterproof
&gt; grease and reassemble. Some adjustment is possible of the base of the gear
&gt; shift, try moving it towards the drivers side as far as possible. 

Yes it was the linkage. The rubber boot in the gearbox end of the linkage
was broken and after i removed some small stones and some sand from the
mechanism 1st gear was back ! On monday i'm going to get an new rubber boot.

The great thing is that i got the truck cheap from the swedish airfroce
because they thought the gerabox was broken. 

Thanks to all who wanted to help me with my problem.

&gt; ****  Do you have the canvas canopy for your crewcab like in your sig.?  If
&gt; so do you have a photo graph, or can you measure the height etc. for me?
&gt;Thanks

I do not have any photos of my busses available on the web yet..

Yes it has the canvas canopy. It seems to be an standard vw accessorie, it
is described in my ownersmanual. It has an metalframe that is bolted to the
4 corners of the bed. The sides and the rear has straps for fastening the
sides when rolled up. The canvas canopy is very common in sweden.

There is two models, one that is the same height as the roof of the cab and
one that is higher. Mine is the higher type. The hight from the ground to
the top of the canopy is 227 centimeter(measured at the back of the truck).
I will post the other measurements later, is it the internal space or the
size of the canopy you are interested in ?

It's been an hecticy day, i have fixed the crewcab and bought an 1972 kombi.
It was quite fun, we had to dig i out of an big snowdrift to testdrive it.
