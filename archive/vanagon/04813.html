&gt; 
&gt; I don't think there is one *correct* reading. Gauge calibration is often
&gt; poor. Moreover, there will be differences depending on where the sender is
&gt; located. Try to observe the readings after a good tune-up and under
&gt; various loads and you'll get your personal range. After that, just watch
&gt; for outliers.

Your gauge, if it is VDO, probably ranges from 0 -  600 F
-- with 350 being the mid-point. When I had the head temp sensor located
at the same point as the FI head sensor I was getting max temps of 225 at
crusing speed, moving it to the no. 3 spark plug raised temps to 350 which
is probably a more accurate reading.....




PS Sami, do you have any contact with the Political Science Department at
Washu? If so say hello to Al Smith and Fiona McGillvray (both rat.
choicers from Hoover). We spent a year together there. DC
