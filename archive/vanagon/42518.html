Subject: Re: '77 Westy: Interference between Bed and Table

Whew, I thought about this one alot on my 6 month trip to Mexico. Never 
did anything about it though.

Observations:
- I think you're just looking for the convenience of leaving the support 
in place. The table gets in the way of the bed when it's being unfolded, 
right?
- I don't think the bracket is important for bed suppport, though. 
Otherwise the back of the upholstery would be torn up on my bed...

Where do you normally store the support bar and table ??
