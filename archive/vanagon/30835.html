&lt;something additional about &quot;dashboard halters&quot;&gt;

now, look, folks .. it's bad enough that SOME of you are putting BRAS on
your buses, but now you want to make them wear HALTERS??? well, this is just
toooooo much. and which kind of halter? like women used to wear with short
pants? or the kind you put on horses??

i mean, really!!! and there was that other bunch who were putting Haynes
briefs and boxers on their buses!!!!

well, i tell you what! MY bus runs around NEKKID!!!!! ha!
(just a little tint on the windows, so the neighbors don't recognize him). :)
