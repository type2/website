Subject: oil light

My '84 vanagon oil light always comes on when coming to idle after a
highway run. Normal,I think,mentioned in the owner's manual. When it's wet
out, my oil light glows dimly, I always thought due to the placement of the
oil sender and the road/moisture. I never pursued it because nothing ever
became of it. 130k on the car.
