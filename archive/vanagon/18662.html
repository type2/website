Subject: air conditioning??

Fellow brick owners,
	I am a new person to the list and have been reading(not responding)
for the last month.  I can't wait to get home from school(Cal. Poly Pom.)
each day and read the list.  I have owned VW's since I was 15 1/2, so over
10 years now.  I recently had my 63 vert stolen from in front of my girl-
friends house:(.  On the rebound, I found a 71 campmobile for $500 with
a blown engine, but the good part is that everything else was complete.
	I have since rebuilt the engine and am having the tran. rebuilt
before taking a trip to Sequoia &amp; Yosemite Nation Parks this next weekend.
Now here is the reason why you have to read this posting...there is a bus
on my street that has what looks to be an electric air conditioner across
the inside of the ceiling, right behind the drivers head.  Are these kind
of ac's run off the gen/alt.??  If so are they still around and how well
do they work??  I don't mind having German ac, but these S. Cal. summers
do get hot once in a while.
	Oh yes, I have a 60 bus(eur) that I am trying to get rid of.  It 
never runs right and whoever had it before me changed it to 12v and did
not complete the job.  The turn signals don't work, the flasher they put
in is two pronged, where the stock one was three.  Also it has a new alt.
and the bat. keeps running low.  I app. the comments and am a soul mate
to any VW that drives buy.
