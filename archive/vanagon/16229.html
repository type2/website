Subject: RE: Aux heat for busses (reprint)

Does anyone know why heater flapper valves are built the way they are?
Rather than being on-off, they either duct heated air into the cabin or
vent it out under the car.  Is it important to the engine to have the
exhaust pipes cooled, or is there some other reason to keep air flowing
through the heater boxes whether the cabin needs heat or not?
B.
