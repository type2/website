Subject: Early 70's Van with Toyota Engine

hey now,

i was camped out in stone mt, ga when i saw this vw van (1970 i believe) with
a radiator in back where the engine compartment door should be. i talked to the
owner he said he bought it and it had a Toyota Corolla engine in it. he didn't
know any details about the conversion it took or anything. he had great heat
coming from the heater...it ran quiet, never overheated. how the hell do you
get a toyota engine in a vw van? it's not something i'd wanna do but it was
kinda kewl.

later,

jonathan
