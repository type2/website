&gt;The reason it seems that the stove in a westy is vented (at 
&gt;least to me) is that there is a round silver
&gt;thing on the outside side panel of the car that says something like
&gt;&quot;flue vent,&quot; no?  Is this not venting the stove?  If not, then
&gt;what IS it venting?
&gt;
&gt;/martha
&gt;
&gt;
I believe it is venting the propane refrigerator.  The owner's manual says 
that rain may come in here so the condensation plug needs to be opened to 
drain the water off.
