Subject: Re: Joy of tranny main bearings

&gt;Recently I began to notice an ever so slight growling sound when my '87
&gt;Syncro (58k) sits at idle in neutral. Additionally, the growling sound goes
&gt;away when I depress the clutch.

I had this problem. It was indeed the input shaft bearing. I got a brand
new, free, syncro tranny from VW under warranty because of it. 

It took about three months for the problem to go from noticeable to scarey
sounding.

It happened after a clutch change, and I suspect the mechanic changing the
clutch might have hung the tranny off the input shaft and bent something. I
think the problem may best be described as affecting the &quot;input shaft
bearing&quot; not the &quot;main bearing&quot; but I am not sure.

&gt;4. While we never reached a consensus on using synthetic tranny lube in the
&gt;rear unit of Syncros, given my specific problem, might switching to
&gt;synthetic help postpone the inevitable?

My dealer suggested I try this when I had that problem, but I bet it won't
help for long and somebody scared us about this last week (tim?). Also, you
want to change it as soon as possible so little metal bits don't get shaved
off and circulate throughout your transmission and ruin it. Probably should
fix it right away for this reason.

&gt;5. If they're going to tear into the tranny, is there other work I should
&gt;have done while they're in there?

Change the final drive gears to 5.43 so you can put bigfoot wheels/tires on
the van.
Change the clutch and throwout bearing.
Resurface the flywheel if needed.
Libricate the CV joints that are exposed.
Be sure to have the front diff mounting bolts loosened as per the manual.
Your mechanic will want to just skip this step but if you skip it you risk
destroying your drive shaft joints over time. When you first bring this up
your mechnic will say &quot;Huh?&quot;
Upon reinstallation be sure to have the mechanic seal the mounting surface
between the trans and the engine with sealant, a special step only for the
syncros, as per the manual. Your mechanic will want to overlook this step.
Attach one of the main bearings with Loctite as per instructions from our
MSDS dude.

&gt;6. Have I arrived at the point where it starts being cost effective for me
&gt;to go buy another Syncro, JUST FOR PARTS?

Definitely. Used syncros (non camper 87s) have been heard to sell for $3,000.

&gt;Thanks as always!
