Subject: Refinements to VW WWW Pages

I've made some changes and improvements to my VW pages.  The main one's &lt;a
href=&quot;http://freenet3.scri.fsu_dot_edu:81/users/joeclark/pages/vwstuff.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 

The tent page now includes new info, an index, and you can download any 
of the .gifs.

I've also added a link to my VAT (Volkswagen Aptitude Test), which you 
should all take :-).  (It acts like an HTML form, but isn't really -- 
unless someone can help me figure out how to get one working.)

All of this assumes I know what the heck I'm doing with HTML.  Heh.

Joe
