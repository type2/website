Subject: RE: california markings


&gt;Where would I look to see if my Vanagon was originally a Cali. car?

Most cars I've seen, have stickers under the hood. Non-CA cars say
&quot;this vehicle conforms to federal emissions laws EXCEPT CALIFORNIA
(emphasis mine). CA cars probably say &quot;including California&quot; or some
such.

Surest way, is probably to take it to a dealer, or a CA smog testing
station.
