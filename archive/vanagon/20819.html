&gt;&gt;yes. a single-seat additional middle seat was available as an option. however,
&gt;&gt;they are extremely rare. :( and to purchase one from the dealer is outrageous
&gt;&gt;... $900!!!!

Reminder: I have an extra factory middle seat for sale for $180 suitable for
a pre-87 Camper (cause it is brown in color, not grey like the later vans.)
It is basically new cause the original owner removed it from the van as soon
as it was purchased.
