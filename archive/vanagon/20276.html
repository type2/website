Subject: Where's the best to sell a Bus?

(A copy of this message has also been posted to the following newsgroups:

hello,
   I'm probably going to sell my '71 bus around late august, but am
considering where I will sell it, as I may go on one last road trip. I
live in baltimore now, but would consider selling it anywhere between here
and california. The engine is very new, new heads, great shape, tranny is
ok, probably ~50,000 mi left on it, body &amp; frame are servicable but
definately not pretty- i.e., rust has been taken care of, but it is not a
restoration job. Paint is primer black. It's been roadtripped extensively,
and very dependable. Where would be the best place to sell? I'm thinking
California may not be such a hot idea, because it isnt pretty, just a
working car. I feel that I could get ~$1500 for it here. Any thoughts? pls
cc: thanks.
