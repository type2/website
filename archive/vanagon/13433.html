i take offense at the 'definition' of deadheads as meanaces.  i am an avid
fan of the grateful dead.  i do not do drugs.  i go to school and i work. 
i know far more 'deadheads' who are responsible persons than those that
are meanaces...

wow, sorry. i don't mean to have a stick up my ass, it's
just that we get a lot of crap
