They never will. Auto insurance companies do not care one whit about 
the passengers, that's for you medical insurance.
Auto insurance co's only care about the vehicle.
I installed high back seats and shoulder straps in my '67 Sqbk. 
Auto insurance co didn't care about my safety.  But I do, so I did.

&gt; wonder when they'll start charging extra for people who have air bags in their
&gt; cars *and* children.
