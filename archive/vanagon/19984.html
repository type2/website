Subject:       Need 3 Westy tent poles

Well, I bought one.  I bought a Westy tent, the Add-a-room one with a 
floor.  Canvas and floor in very nice shape.  also fairly clean but 
it needs to be aired out.

Problem is I need three of the most intricate poles...  the 
outer frame ones that are &quot;L&quot; shaped with another short section 
welded on perpendicular to the &quot;L&quot;.  Also had a little metal rod 
sticking up to loop something on.  I have one so i can make the 
others but if someone has a spare set of these laying around they'd 
want to sell I would be very appreciative.

I knew the poles were missing when i bought it so this isn't a 
crisis-type surprise.  If I don't like it or it doesn't fit an '87 
Westy (anyone know for sure??) i will sell it here on the list, so 
keep you're eyes open and DIGEST mode off!
