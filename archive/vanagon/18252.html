&gt;Vanagon Lowering Spring Kits - Lowers your Vanagon/Vanagon Westfalia
&gt;approximately 1 3/4&quot; (45mm)  Note:  Not for Vanagon GL's 86-91 already
&gt;equipped with lowered running gear package (2wd) or for Syncros.

Are all 86-91's lowered, or how do we find out if our Vanagons already
came with lowered springs? 

Inquisitively,
