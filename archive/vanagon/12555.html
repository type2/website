Subject: Re: List Bumper Sticker?

&gt;So Steve Wall says:
&gt;&gt; So, has anybody thought of coming up with some kind of identification
&gt;&gt; badge that can be placed on our vehicles to identify us as members of
&gt;&gt; &quot;THE list&quot;?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Comments?
&gt;
&gt;Nice idea, but I have a real aversion to putting stickers on my car.
&gt;However, I wouldn't mind hanging a piece of flannel on the antenna. ;)

&gt;
I too don't really like stickers, so how about embelishing the flannel idea
by using five 256K SIMMS chained together?  Heaven knows I've got enough
lying around:-)  Bruce
