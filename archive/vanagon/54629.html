Subject: fridge question

hi volks-

let me start out by saying I have read and tried all recipes for lighting the 
Dometic fridge from here and the archives in my '88 westy.  I have also pulled 
the fridge and disassembled the &quot;firebox&quot;.  it was very clean.  i can see the 
piezo spark is working, and can smell gas after attempts to light.  I have 
never seen the green indicator light go on or even flicker (except on 12V 
power).

so, it has air, spark and fuel (at least while holding down the button).  any 
other ideas????  should i take it to the local camper place???

TIA, the list is great
