Well Lionel, let me share an experience with you.

I went to a VW only mechanic to have my 85 serviced.  The guy was very   
helpful in terms of getting inexpensive parts for my Blue Whale.  But   
unfortunately that was it.  This punk had never worked on a Vanagon.  He   
had a couple of Microbuses in his yard so I assumed that he may have   
worked on a Vanagon.  Well, I ended up paying out my culo for service and   
the work is now doubtfull.  The things he had worked on are now beginning   
to give me problems and it has only been a little over year since he   
performed this work.

On the flip side, some of the non VW mechanics I have gone to have   
actually worked on these Vanagon and the service has been satisfactory.   
 Recently, I ran into a VW only mechanic who ended up saving me over $400   
on a break job.  This new guy is who I am going to take my Blue Whale to   
be serviced.  He doesn't, however, do engine rebuilds or heads but so far   
he is gaining my trust.  I still don't trust mechanincs but hey who   
knows.

Just be careful and don't assume that because he worked on Jettas, Golfs   
and Rabbits that he obviously know about Vanagons. I mean, break work,   
oil changes and things of that caliber I trust to other shops but   
anything else, only Vanagoneers.

Good Luck My man,
Nate El Great
85 GL and just had my heads rebuilt

Is it best to only let a VW 'specialist' work on your Bus (1982 Vanagon)   
or
are things so straightforward that an experienced non-specific mechanic
will be fine? Obviously all things being equal you would prefer the
specialist but what if you had to travel a long distance and pay twice   
the
hourly rate? I am talking about not only the annual service but also   
fault
finding and things like clutch, steering/suspension stuff, starting stuff
etc.
