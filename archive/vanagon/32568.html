Subject: engine swaps

With all the talk of putting Suburu, V-6, &amp; Volvo engines into VWs, on the way
to work this morning I thought .. Put the 2.l type IV engine INTO SOMETHING
ELSE.
My dad took my old bug's engine for use as a lawnmower engine (never saw the
light of day), but that's as close as it gets.
 
Really, though, would it be a problem to build up the tin &amp; have the air flow in
directly through the radiator grill?
