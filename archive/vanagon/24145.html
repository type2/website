Whats the diff between a Harley and a Hoover?

The position of the dirtbag!

(no, not you, bob)

I can see Bob goin' up 5 in his baling wire mobile and gettin' pulled
over.  Trooper walks up, looks in the window and sez
&quot;Oh!  Its _you_ bob!&quot;

Bob's yer uncle!

Hey Bob! - If you're in Sac, drop by!
