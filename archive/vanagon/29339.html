Subject: RE: Highest mileage?


&gt;I'm sure this has been asked before, but I was wondering what is the
&gt;highest mileage any of us has seen on a bus.  I don't care about
&gt;rebuilds, swapped trannys etc., just how many miles has the bus
&gt;traveled since it rolled off the showroom floor?


Well, an EXTREME rebuild, or series of them, might eventually make a
difference. Remember the saying: &quot;This is George Washington's axe. We've
replaced the handle three times and the head twice, but it's definitely
his axe&quot;.
