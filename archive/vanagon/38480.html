It sure appears to be a microscopic crack in the head. I've watched it 
closely using a mirror to view the underside of the bolt area. I see 
coolant weeping out of the head while the bolt area appears to be dry. I 
did a BarsLeak treatment and that slowed the leak quite a bit but did not 
completely stop it. I just took a 600 mile trip and didn't lose enough 
coolant to make a difference. I'm going to try to nurse it through another 
20k miles--then I'll rebuild the heads.

To replace a head bolt, do you have to remove the head and do them all? Or 
can you fix one without removing the head?
