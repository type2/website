&gt;Is $1,250 a good deal for a 1985 Vanagon w/ 115,000 miles?  Is it too good
&gt;of a price, that is should I expect a major problem?

Having an 85......I have found that they are prone to head gasket leaks and
are generally underpowered with the 1.9l engine.  $1250 is a good price.
 But, be prepared to spend some money and have some downtime in the future.
 If you aren't more than just a weekend mechanic with a good set of tools, I
would advise buying a newer vanagon.  Besides, the larger 2.1l engine started
in 86, the interior was improved in later years, etc...  Just my $.02....
