Subject: RE What is a Zamboni

                                   4/29/96                        11:24 AM

A Zamboni is a small 4 wheel drive machine that is used to re-surface the ice
for Ice skating/hocky rinks.  It has a wide blade that is pulled at the back
edge of the machine to scrape the ice smooth.  The ice shavings are gathered
up and go into a storage bin.  Immediately behind the scraper blade, a thin
fim of water is laid down to freeze to a new smooth ice surface.

The particular machine I am familiar with was powered by an upright VW engine
(with a fropzen #3(?) spark plug.  

The name, Zamboni is for the guy that invented it( and I am sure there are
appropriate patents on the machine and probably copyright on the name).
