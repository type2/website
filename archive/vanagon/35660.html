Subject: '68 pickup,clutch,the problem

Listvolks,
I dropped the engine tonight and found out why the clutch quit working.  The 
two supports that drop from the cross shaft and hold the throwout bearing 
had spread apart.  This allowed the throwout bearing to slip back on one 
side.  The little clippie that is to hold it was down at the bottom of the 
bell housing.  It looks to be the clippie type that goes in horizontally.

Now the questions.  This vehicle, Opie, had set for 3.5 yrs before I got it. 
 The pressure plate and area around it has red dust all over it - like rust. 
 Do pressure plates dry out, or is this likely from surface rust from the 
friction plates?  Can you lube pressure plates?  What, if anything, should I 
replace?  Pressure plate?  Throwout bearing? Clutch?  Entire cross shaft?  I 
have bent the cross shaft supports back vertical, but is it likely to happen 
again?  I still have trouble thinking of what could cause this.

Are all pressure plate/throwout bearing combinations interchangeable, i.e. 
could I use a type 4 pressure plate/throwout bearing set?

I have put about 4000 miles on the truck since I got it.  It felt like it 
was all working fine - engine, clutch, transmission (except for the bungee 
cord 4th).  The engine is a dual port 1600, AK case.

Thanks for help and opinions,

Dean &amp; Opie
