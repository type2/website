Hi Alice!  Yes, I think it is going to take place, although hardly
anyone responded to my earlier query.  I had proposed that the
thing take place in two parts:  one for CA, AZ, NM (and anyone else
wishing to attend) in Red Rock, near/in the Mojave desert on March
24-26.  Further, I suggested that the rest of the people
interested, namely CA, ORE, WA, CA (and anyone else wishing to attend)
congregate in somewhere like northern Oregon, but on a different
weekend. I asked for suggestions for dates for the latter, but
got hardly any input.

CAMPERS:  are you alive???!?  Do you want to actually CAMP in
your vehicles or just daydream about it?  Sign up now! - use your
vehicle for that which it was truly best intended.
