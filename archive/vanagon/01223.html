Since we are on the generic subject of bus nomenclature, here is an
interesting tidbit of info.  My '84 Vanagon was originally purchased
in Germany, toured Europe and then shipped states side.  When I purchased
the van it came with a big stack of relevant paper work including a
photo copy of the original registration in Germany which lists the
vehicle as follows:

	1984 VW - Microbus

Kind of suprised me as I always asociated the microbus name with the
split window variety.  I think the VW FAQ even states that it is 
sacrilegious to call any post '67 transporter a microbus.  I guess
I own a microbus.
