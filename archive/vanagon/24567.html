&gt; Rusty,
&gt;         Be good.  Let people write how they may.  In context, you'd be
&gt; surprised how much Spanish or Swahili you'd be able to understand, 
&gt; Sahib.  We are negotiating between machine and people.  That is this 
&gt; list.  Let's not scare our non-english speakers off of the list.  Many
&gt; of them have probably learned how to write english better than us.

Gary,                                                            ^^
                                                                 ^^
I will correct your English once. Your last sentence should read:

&quot;Many of them have probably learned how to write English better than
we do.&quot; The pronoun &quot;us&quot; is resevered for accusative and dative
cases.  Also, English should always be capitalized (in English, but
not in Spanish).
