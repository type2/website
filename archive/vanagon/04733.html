&gt; HA!  RIDE ON!! Someone else with enough brains to get out of the bike biz
&gt; AND put some lube on the lug bolts; ya done good, Stuart!  ;-)
&gt; 
	Yeah, I escaped from NY in 1980 by peddling my shitbox Raleigh Comp. to
	Colorado. Got a job in Boulder in a 1st class bike shop. Ended up work-
	for 3 seasons; 2 in Boulder and 1 in Seattle. But, yeah, the only
	beneficiary of the retail bike biz is the owner.

	BUt, one consequence of working in that biz....I sure was in good shape.
	I'm not disciplined enough to be active working in an engineering
	environment.

	So, I'm overweight with a good income. I have days when I'd trade to 
	be poor and fit, again. But, how would I afford toys like a '91 VC?

&gt; care of (hey, Stuart, I still use Phil Wood grease!...).

	Well, kinda expensive, but at least it doesn't taste bad :-)

&gt; 
&gt; Oh, and that other helpful hint about the cheater bar (say, three feet, or so),
&gt; also a very good idea; judging by the threads I've read the past half year or
&gt; so,
&gt; not only does it give you more leverage to change your flat tire, but, it
&gt; will also do the following:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) crush the begeezus out of pesky little meeses that invade your bus
&gt; 
&gt; 2) ditto above, except sub neighborhood miscreants for meeses
&gt; 
&gt; 3) temporarily hold a mob at bay any time you're visiting South Central L.A.
&gt; and they announce yet another Rodney King decision
&gt; 
&gt; 4) would probably have greater effect on Ric and Steven's collective heads
&gt; than if Martha klonks them with a cell phone.  ;-)  ;-)
&gt; 

	Uh, well, I don't carry the big wrench in my car......
