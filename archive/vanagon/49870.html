&lt;&lt; well, i have 1000 miles on a rebuild now (top end), and i''m hearing the
 same symptoms that i heard 1000 miles after the previous rebuild
 (complete), and that is a chirping sound on acceleration.  it only happens
 in neutral at the moment, but if past experience proves worth anything, it
 will soon move to first, then second and third.  it sounds exactly like it
did
 when i had a dropped valve seat.
 
 background:  full rebuild by mechanic (has done 5 other rebuilds of
 air-cooled vanagons this summer alone, has been doing this for many
 many years) in june, drove 3000 miles, heard chirping and lost major
 power, mechanic said valves were not seating.  sent heads back to
 mark stephens, they did a valve job, replaced exhaust guides, and flycut
 heads (no charge except shipping, although what i really wanted was a
 different set of heads). 2nd rebuild done earlier this month, 1000 miles on
 it now, seems to be starting with same symptoms as rebuild last time. 
 after the rebuild this time, i took it to another mechanic to make sure
 valves were initially set properly and they were.
  &gt;&gt;
The chirping noise usually comes from the head gaskets fluttering.  Either
the case or the heads are not straight.  Very common problem to have a warped
case on thse engines. Pul heads and check cylinder alignment with precision
straight edge.  It will tell all.
