&gt;Anyway, he went on to say that he had two squarebacks and
&gt;one van he was selling:
&gt;
&gt;'71 Squareback - manual, new interior, runs
&gt;'72 Squareback - automatic, blown engine
&gt;
&gt;will sell both for $500
&gt;
&gt;'75(he thinks) Van - runs and is complete(what that means, I don't know)
&gt;
&gt;didn't say how much he would sell it for.
&gt;
&gt;The gentle left his home phone number =&gt; (206)348-5988 and lives
&gt;North of Seattle WA.

Say, Bob, could this be your ticket home??? Better pack that
spare engine to travel! I once saw an upright engine installed
in a squareback... had to leave the lid off. In truth, I don't
know what all was necessary to complete such an installation
(clutch? Rear mount if any? Sheet metal? Throttle cable? Muffler?)
