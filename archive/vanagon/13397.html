Okay guys, I need some serious help here:

	I bought my '77 bus last february.  Everything was fine until one
snowy March day, it wouldn't turn over, ya' know turn the key, get this very
quiet whining sound, brake light (on dash) dims, but nothing happens.  So I
bring it to a VERY reputable VW shop and have a new starter and solenoid
installed.  2 weeks later, same deal, the key does nothing.  I brought it
back to the shop but they could find nothing wrong; in fact EVERY time I
bring t in ti have the problem fixed, the key works fine in the lot of the
garage.   Now, I figure
that there's something screwy with the ignition box 'cause some previous
owner installed a little on/off switch under the column for the battery.
The bus starts (when it wants to) by turning the switch to ON and the
turning the key.  All the key does is operate the starter and unlock the
steering.  I shut the bus off by pulling the switch to OFF.  Now the key
stopped working for the starter back in March of last year.  It used to only
not work after I'd been driving for an hour or so on the highway but has
become even more erratic since then.  I start the bus on these occasions by
shrting the solenoid with a screwdriver with the battery switch set to ON.
Finally I got annoyed at this ang got some have guage wire and installed one
end to the ignition lead on the solenoid and the other to the bolt on the
solenoid that is connected to the battery, ran this to that dashboard and
installed a household light switch to operate the starter (a keyless
ignition).  Now that doesn't work (one week ago).  HELP!!!!!!!   PLEASE!!!!!!

thanks,
nick
