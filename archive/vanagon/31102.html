Subject: EV Bentley manual next summer

I received a reply from Bentley regarding the EuroVan manuals: mid to late
next summer is the expected delivery date. Hope your warranties all last
until then!

If you want to be on the notification list, send a message to
'sales_at_rb_dot_com'. They'll also send you a free catalog if you include a
snail-mail address.
