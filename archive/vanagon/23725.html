Subject: wife solos vw microbus....

Well the day has finally arrived.... the neon's at the garage (scheduled
mainttenance, etc.) and kerylynn needs to get about.  Can I drop you off
at werk and have the bus today?  (We just got back from 5 hrs north into
maine this weekend, new kyb shocks in the rear, rebuilt transaxle last 
month, starter problem fixed..).  Quick road test/check out and she's
off shopping with gracie (my 3 year old) in the '65 deluxe.....

wonders never cease.
