Propane is a poor electrical source.  12VDC is a poor heat source.

Your dometic fridge from hell uses heat expansion heated by propane, 110vac or
12VDC to heat the exchange mechanism.  Doesn't work too well on 12VDC, works
lots better on Propane.

BTW there's a flame sensor that shuts off the propane if the fire dies, req'd
by law in both US and Canada.

The trick is in a MAJOR crash where a propane line is ruptured what happens at
the regulator.  Does it mechanically detect high flow and shut off or ???

Now where did I put that Dometic Fellers' card anyway.

Any input, Drew, Gerry, Joel, billybob or??
