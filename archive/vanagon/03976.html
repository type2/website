Dear Steve,

Thanks you for your cerebrally-challenged diatribe of your recent
locationally-challenged venture to Idaho with your botanical
companion.  Sounds like you spent a lot of time being
vertically- and sobriety-deprived.  As an x-chromosome-deficient
person of mass, you should realize that most of us gyno-americans
on the list might find your trip report attentionally-disabled,
and metabolically-problematic with regard to activities such
as talking cars, hiking, fishing, and other typical subjects
that living mass persons with testosterone-poisoning find interesting.
Speaking for other persons of gender, I think we would now all like
to hear a little more about other parts/subjects of the trip
which are not quite so electroencephalographically-flat.  Someone
who is as chronologically-gifted as you, ought to know that
we fe-persons (womin?) like to hear about things like cooking,
sewing, shopping, and interior decor of your vanagon.

Altogether, however, I'm glad that as you took this trip while
being occupationally-deprived, that it was not a total 
incomplete success!..

;)  /martha

p.s.:  The next time you decide to become in a relatively
temporarily inert state, it would be interesting to hear
more about any bouts of directional non-discrimination you
undergo, and what you find of interest there....
