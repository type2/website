&gt; Anyway, I know of the basic
&gt; historical changes in design ('49, '67, etc...) and believe that the third
&gt; (late '70s) will start to be out of my price range. I'm willing to spend
&gt; between $2000-$2500, maybe more if a peach materializes.

&gt;    IMHO you can't go wrong with a post-73 camper. Just don't
&gt;    buy any flavor of Vanagon or (God forbid!) a Eurovan.

Bite your toungue, Campmobile-Boy! ;&gt;. 

This could get ugly fast, and I'm sure Ric is pre-heating his Eurovan-powered 
flame thrower while you read this. I *really* don't want this to turn into a &quot;my
year brick is better than your year brick&quot; argument, but for this price range, I
think an air cooled Vanagon (or *maybe* a Westy if your're lucky) would be an 
excellent choice in terms of roadhandling, interior space and reliability. You 
also wouldn't go wrong with a well maintained '70's loaf either, of course. 
IMHO, the '78-79 offer a much better fuel injection system (AFC).

Good Luck,
Erik
