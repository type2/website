&gt; Last week I mentioned that a friend of mine was looking for a camper.
&gt; He found this at a dealer:
&gt; 
&gt; '85 Westfalia, automatic, A/C, one owner, $6,950.
&gt; 
&gt; miles unknown. We're going to check it out this afternoon, but I would
&gt; like to know all you people's opinions on what a fair price would be,
&gt; assuming the vehicle is in good shape.
&gt; 
&gt; TIA!
