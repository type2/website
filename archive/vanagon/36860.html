Howdy volks,

I'm looking for a window pane from one of the 78-79 style sliding side
windows.  The pane I need is the rear (stationary) piece of glass from
the sliding door--not the vent-wing style, but the one in the aluminum
slider tracks.  If anybody has one/knows of one/knows where I can order
one, please let me know who/what/where and how much $$$.

Also, just out of curiosity, what kind of window seal do these windows
use?  I've never seen a window seal listed by RMMW or WCM specifically
for these sliding windows--will the same seal that is used on the
louvered Westfalia windows work on the sliding windows?

-Rodney
