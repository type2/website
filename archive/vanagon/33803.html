Depending upon how concerned and flush you are an alternative is:  A baby
monitor.  I think that there are at least two on the market, but the one I
know of is sold by (Who else) Fischer Price.  It is a wide angle Infared
camera complete with infrared emitting diode matrix light source.  It is
completely wireless in transmission of audio and Video, runs off of a 12Vdc
wall adaptor (included).  While it is not weatherproof, I am sure that a
little ingenuity will address that.  It transmitts in the 900 Mhz band.  Price
is about $300.  Don't know how well it would do looking at an outside area,
but works fine in the baby's room. Comes with 5&quot; B&amp;W &quot;TV&quot; receiver.
