&gt;&gt; My wife and I just decided to add to our VW &quot;collection&quot;.  We are 
looking
&gt;&gt; for a reasonably late model passenger Vanagon.  We are noticing (as 
we did
&gt;&gt; when we started looking for our camper bus) that the majority of 
Vanagons
&gt;&gt; have broken slider door handles (the outside one).  Can anybody tell 
me why?
&gt;&gt; I'm sure we're not imagining this, I'm talking about over 50% here.  
How
&gt;&gt; much do they cost?
&gt;
&gt;No, Alex you're not imagining things I've noticed the same thing on 
Vanagons.
&gt;In fact the slider handle on my '80 twisted off in my hand about a 
year ago.
&gt;It has something to do with the turning/pulling stresses on the base 
of 
&gt;this casting. 
&gt;Since then I have not been able to find a used handle at wrecking 
yards 
&gt;in my area and although I haven't checked out a new price, from past 
&gt;experience on other parts, I'm pretty sure I don't want to pay it.
&gt;Does anyone else on the list know dealer $$$ on this part? Or better 
yet 
&gt;have a good used one they'd part with? 
&gt;*Just checked with dealer **94.25** for new handle I knew I didn't 
want t
&gt;o pay it. Now I'm really interested in a used one. Anyone?

Heidi Ho Neighbor, 

I had to replace the handle on my Vanagon ('82 Diesel) and had similar 
shopping experience.  Finally bought from VW dealer/parts, it took a 
week to swim from GDR and it cost $77.00 (better than $94 but still a 
_rip_).
