Subject: generator luck ????

On the Wednesday after the mammoth drive to go camping with the CCC's in the
Sequoia National forest I was driving to work when the generator light came
on!!. The fan belt was smoking and the pulley on the generator had shattered
causing the generator to freeze. I drove without a fan belt a couple of miles
but the cylinder head temp gauge told me this was not the thing to do so I
got towed to Campbell. 
I had had charging problems in November 1995 and had had a new generator and
alternator put in the 70 bus by Peninsula Automotive in Campbell. 
They replaced the whole unit free of charge although I was prepared to pay
for it. So I guess that I am lucky on two counts. 1) the generator did not
explode in the middle of the mountains where there were no replacements and
2) Peninsula Auto (Dave Williams) replaced it free of charge.

So Peninsula Autohas my full endorsement abd I guess that I really was lucky.
