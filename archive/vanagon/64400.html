&gt;&gt;The dreaded brake fade! I experienced it also on a long twisty
downhill
two lane road that ends up in the Big South Fork of the Cumberland
River.
No, I did not roll in. I detected that unmistakable odor of brake
pads
but thought it was my friends Volvo in front of me. I was shocked to
find
instead it was my crewcab!!!! It happens, be warned.

&lt;snip&gt; The brakes did act up a little when we were
&gt;leaving and going down a long steep grade following about 30 cars
and a
big
&gt;truch out in front. The breakes actually got a little mushy for
awhile

We were taught to avoid brake fade by downshifting and braking until
you're slow enough to let your brakes cool; let it roll til your too
fast and brake again. I do this and never had brake fade. Ya let it
roll on it own so the brakes can cool off.
