&gt; My starter is getting tired and either needs to be replaced or rebuilt.
&gt; It has been rebuilt once before and I am wondering:
&gt; 
&gt; 	1) What is involved in rebuilding the starter?

You take it into an auto supply house and ask for a rebuilt.

&gt; 	2) How many times can I rebuild it before it is not worth the
&gt; 	effort anymore? (Or is it ever worth the effort?)

I've never heard of a limit.  I think they just clean it up, put in new 
bearings and windings, and then paint them black.
