Subject: Re: putting bus to bed

&gt;up and down the driveway once in a while.  Would it be wise to put it
&gt;under a cover?  It has some seam rust, and will be in Connecticut...

Forget the cover unless they can take it off from time to time. A year is a
long time. Water buildup can cause paint bloom.  For 'dead' storage consider
the following...

You can buy 'engine fogger' storage spray, check a marine supplier.  You
spray this stuff into the engine while idling, steadily until it stalls out.
Old way was to get the engine hot, set carbs on fast idle and slowly pour in
a quart of oil until it stalled out.  Oil coated everything inside, right
through to the tail pipe.  Fogger is new method, same idea. This coats
everything inside with a rust preventative coating.  Naturally do an oil and
filter change right before this.  Your brakes will rust to uselessness,
might as well pull the discs and drums and put them in storage (oiled),
leave the bus on blocks. Put something over the brake pedal to keep the
unknowing from stepping on the brake and popping out the pistons. Lube the
parking brake cables, and leave the brake slack. Bleeding out brake and
clutch with fresh fluid wouldn't hurt. The shock rods may rust up, and if
they are 'out' because the van is blocked, when you return to use it the
rusted sections will drop back into the body and ruin the seals in a while.
Keep weight off the tires, and store them out of direct sunlight.
Muffler/pipes will rust up outside well. Battery will die in 2 weeks and if
not recharged will stay dead due to sulfation.  Add a gas stabilizer and
fill the gas tank.  Temperature cycles will cause condensation all over the
engine/tran etc. so wire/terminals corrosion will happen.  Again some sort
of oil based rust preventative spray should be applied liberally.  Pressure
washing the undersides and drying out before spraying would be good. Is this
going to be on a paved drive/garage/dirt?  Dirt is bad, due to moisture
release, grass is worst due to oxygen rich air speeding corrosion. Soak your
seams with preservative too. Needless to say double or triple waxing the
paint would be good too. Some ventilation opening for the van will help cope
with any leaks you may have. How's that for a nightmare? :(

If your parents can run it until hot, 20 minutes, preferably some highway,
once a week, it will do fine without the above preparation, or sell it? =:O
oh nooooo   tim 

PS: can your folks handle flat tires and dead battery/no start gremlins etc?
if not the van will likely be left sitting despite their best intentions and
efforts.
