&gt; BTW, while we're talking about wierd combinations, did you see the picture
&gt; of a '63 bus with a sliding door in V*lksw*rld a while ago. At least I think
&gt; it was a '63, it was definitely earlier than '67 when these were supposed to
&gt; be first available.

Nope, '63 was the first year.
