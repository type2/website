Subject: Re: Battery Drain

I've always had a slight drain on my battery, due to clock/LCD display in 
the stereo which I measured around 90 milli-amps, tiny. When my battery got 
old/weak and I didn't drive for a week or so I had starting problems. I was 
told the 'brain' likes a certain voltage level to function properly, and the 
already depleted battery when cranking the starter wasn't putting out high 
enough volts, despite spinning the starter adequately. A new battery cured 
this, but was a cheapo that started to die after 3 months.
         A note for our Canadian viewers: DON'T EVER BUY a battery from 
Canadian Tire Corp. They are crap, I had 4 in 18 months, all replaced over 
the counter. Then I moved 1000 miles, lost the warranty card, and needed yet 
another battery which they won't give me, under the 24 month free 
replacement deal. They would like me to &quot;keep your voice down and please 
leave since we can't help you...&quot; (expletives deleted). Calls to corporate 
headquarters netted me zero.
