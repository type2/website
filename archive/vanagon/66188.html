Subject:      Curtains for 90 Vanagon?

Hello all, I'm new to the list.  We just acquired a gorgeous 1990 Vanagon
Carat.  I did lots of research online when we launched our quest for a
camper or van and I want to thank all who have been involved in putting
such a wealth of knowledge on the Web.  I felt like I could really make an
informed decision when this baby came our way.

Now I'm seeking curtains.  The van has snaps for the mindbogglingly
expensive curtains ($200 EACH!) offered by VW.  I have a request in to
Z-Products out in Oregon for info on their curtains-and-hardware kit, which
is $169.  Any words of wisdom on the Z-Prods curtains?  Or (it could happen
...) anyone have a set of curtains which you're dying to unload?

I know I could probably sew up a set myself.  But I'd like to have curtains
before my kids are off to college ... actually I'd like them in time for
our first camping trip in October!
