Subject: Re: '85 Westfalia Air Conditioning



... I remember we discussed this before... There are two distinct
types of A/C used in Vanagons.  It might be a good idea to check
the archives.  My Cousin happens to have an '87 Westy (2.1 liter
engine) that has the A/C unit with the only two vents in the back.
His A/C in PA summers is marginally useful.  My '87 is a Wolfsburg
weekender, and has the other type of A/C that has the vents lined
up along the middle column that goes all the way from back to 
the front of the bus.  It cools the Vanagon very well, and takes
less than a few minutes until we need to tone it down.

The EV's Air Conditioners (notice the plural :-), are, of course,
a completely different story (brrrrrrr :-)
