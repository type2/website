Subject: porsche heads question (sorta VW)

hi,

have a set of nice heads that i got with a parts car, and thought that they
were for an air cooled VW, but on closer inspection they look like old
porsche heads.

i am trying to find out what kind of engine they came out of.

the part number (i think) is 616.104.301.1R

anybody have any thoughts how old these heads are. is there a porsche list
i should be directing this to?

any leads appreciated.

michael
