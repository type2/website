Subject: '87 syncro: driveshaft going?
Date: Mon, 29 Apr 1996 11:12:45 -0700

I've been noticing a clunking sound as I engage the clutch after shifting. 
Feels like there is some play somewhere in the drivetrain. The sound is 
like a metal-on-metal clunk, not unlike the sound I remember from shifting 
an American car with auto tranny into the Drive position. I suspect that 
the U joints in the driveshaft are wearing out. Any other ideas? How does 
one definitively check the driveshaft U joints?

I've already called around to price U joint replacement and found a place 
has worked on syncro driveshafts and seems to know what they are talking 
about. From reading previous posts on this subject, I am aware that syncro 
driveshafts can be a problem if not done properly. I know I need to mark 
the alignment of the shaft before removal and be sure to reinstall it in 
the original orientation. What else do I need to be aware of? Is there any 
other component of the driveshaft that should be rebuilt when the U joints 
are replaced?

Also, Bentley says &quot;Caution: Front final drive alignment must be done to 
ensure driveshaft is installed without distortion.&quot; How do you align the 
front final drive?
