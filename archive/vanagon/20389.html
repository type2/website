Subject: Atlanta Area Bus Wanted

Hey, I'm looking for a camper van in the Atlanta Area for sale.  Anything
that predates 1979. However, my favorite years are '68-71, and my REAL
favorite years are '49-67 (hehe, but I doubt I'll find one of those)...
anyways, if anyone has any leads, just let me know.
