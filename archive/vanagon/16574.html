Subject: Re: Fan Belt Woes

&gt;    Driving thru downtown today, I began to hear a noise like metal scraping
&gt;along the pavement, and then pulled over to see what was dragging. Nada. I
&gt;opened the engine compartment and lo and behold the fan belt had a big ole
&gt;gasher in it. Below that, there was some fresh oil on the compartment base
&gt;and was dripping from the oil sensor itself!! What's this??!! Did the engine
&gt;just get so hot that it began to seep from the sensor?? The sensor also looks
&gt;as though it's not completely screwed in anymore. What's goin' on?? Why
&gt;didn't my oil light come on? *perplexed* I can change the belt, but I'm
&gt;looking for some input on the oil sensor deal. &quot;preciate it!

Oh, Rachel, Rachel, Rachel

Did the belt slap the sensor and waste it?

Will it screw back in?
