Subject: Re: Fuel Pump Problem?

Mark,

This is weird, because the same exact thing happened to me on Sunday! Like you, 
I was on my way to a bike ride (you know the Calavares loop near Fremont/Sunol?)
Hopped in, fired 'er up, and alas, no idle. BTW, I have an '82 Westy. But, it 
only occurred when the engine was cold. (ie. good idle when motor warmed up) I 
thought, hmmm, something with the cold start valve or aux air regulator. Sure 
enough, there is a rubber elbow on the hose that runs into the auxiliary air 
regulator, and that had corroded and broken. Its a cloth braided hose, about 
1/2&quot; around on top of your motor.

The local dealer actually had it in stock ($3). Whew, an easy one for a change!

Hope you're as lucky,

Erik.

&gt; I'm in a real bind here, so I hope someone can help me out...
&gt; 
&gt; My 81 Vanagon keeps dieing unless I keep the accelerator
&gt; pressed slightly.  In other words, car is fine when gas
&gt; pedal is pressed, but once my foot comes off the pedal,
&gt; it dies.  At stoplights I have to keep pumping the gas
&gt; to keep it from dieing, and if there's a sudden stop
&gt; on the freeway, it's a white knuckle situtation to keep
&gt; it from konking out.
&gt; 
&gt; It's a 4-speed; 140k miles, I'm the third owner; and
&gt; could use a valve job.  I run plain unleaded gas and
&gt; 20/50 oil.
&gt; 
&gt; Any help is *REALLY* appreciated (I've got to get to
&gt; a bike race early sunday morning).
