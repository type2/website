Subject: Any engines for sale?

After changing the head gasket in my diesel, I find that it was helping
to hide a lack of compression/ring problem. Of course, now comes the
debate...  

Do I rebuild this engine?  
Do I buy a &quot;pre-owned diesel?  
Do I buy a long block diesel?  
Do I opt for the ol' diesel-to-gas swap?
If I swap, do I get a &quot;pre-owned&quot; engine or a rebuilt engine or rebuild
an old engine myself? 
ad nauseum :p

Comments are welcome but not necessary.  I just need to vent :^?
