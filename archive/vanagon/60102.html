Subject: Trip, KC to St. Louis

Hi All,

Tomorrow I am delivering my Brown 84 GL from KC to St. Louis to its new
owner.  All seems well for smooth sailing, I hope it goes well.  If anyone
sees me along the way, be sure and wave...or help me out if I breakdown!
8-)   So far the rebuild has 400 miles without incident.  Hopefully it
will do well for the new owner who is taking it back to Kentucky with him
from St. Louis.
