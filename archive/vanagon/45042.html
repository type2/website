Subject: I need a wiper arm for my '66
Date: Sun, 23 Jun 1996 18:21:53 -0400

Well, I was fixing up the Safari windows in my '66, but I'm stuck now. =
One of the wiper arms that I have doesn't fit the pivot piece because =
it's not the original arm. I've checked all the catalogs for parts =
dealers and NOBODY has it for sale. So I was wondering if anybody has an =
extra or wouldn't mind trading for mine which works fine and looks fine, =
it's just a little wider base. Thanks for the help!

Peace,
Rafi
