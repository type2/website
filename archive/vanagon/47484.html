Subject: Re: O2 sensors: 1-wire to replace 3-wire?


&gt; With that in mind, here are a few questions for those in the know:
&gt; (I checked the archives, but didn't find definitive answers to these)
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Is it possible/practicable to use a 1-wire to replace the 3-wire?
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Will the slower warm up time of the sensor w/out the heater be a problem?
&gt;     (i.e., do I *really* need the heated sensor for good functionality?)
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Do both types have the same output voltage?
&gt; 
&gt; If I must use a 3-wire on the 86, does anyone know of a source for an
&gt; equivalent but, less expensive sensor?  [ the # on the part appears to be 0
&gt; 258 001 051. ] 
&gt;

The three wire one merely has a heater.  The qualified answer is that either
will work *if* the single-wire one gets up to temperature.  I suspect that
the Vanagon placement in the catalytic converter gets *mighty* warm -- about
like hell on a good day (or Redbluff in the middle of the night).  While 
warming up, your engine will run quite rich, not good, but not critical.
Any three wire one will do -- just cut off the wrong connector and splice on
the old one from yours (assuming you have the old one).  I don't even know
what mine is to -- I just went into Chief and asked for a three-wire 
sensor.  It cost about $35 (they were on sale)  The salescritter looked at
me a little strange...

I actually had bought this sensor to experiment with on my airplane, but
it never got used (airplane gas still has lead LOTS of lead, and it slowly
poisons the sensors, good idea, but a little short).  When I needed one for
my new van to get through smog -- snip/splice -- passed smog ok, runs like
a champ.  Ask at your local parts-place if they have a universal three-wire.
Most places sell universal single-wire ones (and you don't have to cut off
the wrong bits!)

I'd put the three-wire type in, but I'm not strapped for cash.  In the 'ol
days, I'd've used a single wire one, and saved the ten bucks.  In the 'ol
days, though, I drove a '57, and this never seemed to be an issue.
