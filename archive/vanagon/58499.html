Subject: Side View Mirror List Deal Update!

The List Mirror Deal for Busses and Vanagons is a go.  The mirrors are on
their way from Germany, and should be here in two to three weeks assuming
no customs delays, etc.   If you e-mailed me for mirrors, I will be
e-mailing you back to confirm your order within the next week.  If you did
not e-mail me, and want some, please let me know (and include your ZIP
code) as I did order a few extra.

To recap, I these are Original-Equipment German Mirrors, not the lower
quality Mexican ones, at a fraction of the dealer price.

Bus Mirrors (1968-1979 only)  $18.50 each 
(does not include the part that screws into the door (which is another
$3.50 ea. if you need it).  

Vanagon mirrors (pre-89 style, non-electric, flat glass),  $19.95 each. 

Mirrors for Beetles ('67-on), Golfs, Jettas, Audis, etc. are also
available; e-mail me.
 
Also, a couple of list members asked me about the convex style Vanagon
mirrors which eliminate the blind spot (again, these are NOT the
late-Vanagon electric ones, but are the same as above only curved glass. I
looked into this, and can get them, but since they are not usually sold in
the US, there is a minimum purchase of 30 PAIR.  Price would be $31.50
each.  I suspect that there is not enough interest to justify a 30-pair
purchase, but let me know if I'm wrong.

Thanks,
