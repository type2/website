(about the 5-cylinder vanagon)
&gt;There is a slight possibility that I could be wrong, but while i was home in
&gt;winter, I saw a blue 1990 volkswagen vanagon, with strange &quot;ground effects&quot;,
&gt;the front bumper had a european liscence plate shape inbedded in it.  ok so
&gt;i open the rear gate and pop the hatch and look in and poke around and check
&gt;if i can access the sparkplugs, etc...and i look at the distributor cap and
&gt;there's six plugs coming off of it and i ask how many cylinders it has and
&gt;im told its a five cylinder.  and i was surprised but it was true, it was
&gt;explained to me and everything.  (I was also told it was air cooled, but
&gt;that's real strange...)  so, call a dealership.  And like i said, i could be
&gt;wrong, but im not making this up, and im not purpously stirring up the
&gt;hostilities..

well ... i can see that i have been remiss in leaving the classroom and
letting Ric out of his cage to go beat up on the new kids in school! :)
and Steven has been simply egging him on! shame! shame!!

now, back to today's lesson:
IMHO a euro vanagon with a &quot;strange ground effects&quot; would most likely be
an Oettinger conversion van, capable of having their own 6-cylinder flat
water-cooled engine installed. the only way to know for sure would be to
describe the distinctive crest molded into the &quot;scropion-looking&quot; air intake
manifold, or the WBX-6 emblem on the rear hatch.

however, there ARE other companies that also make conversions of vw vanagons
(and now, Eurovans) so it IS possible that someone has found a market for
the 5-cylinder audi engines. possibly from South Africa? any ideas, Wouter?
so to totally discount the possibility of a 5-cylinder in this country is
a bit premature.

now ... in my library of junk and stuff, i have not run across any mention
of a vanagon with a five cylinder, by vw or any conversion company. in the
books, the only engines available in the vanagon FROM VOLKSWAGEN were:
- 4-cylinder air-cooled 1.6 liter (1979-1982)
- 4-cylinder air-cooled 2.0 liter (1979-1982)
- 4-cylinder diesel 1.6 liter (1981-1987)
- 4-cylinder diesel 1.6 liter turbocharged (1985-1991)
- 4-cylinder water-cooled 1.9 liter (1982-1991)
- 4-cylinder water-cooled 2.1 liter (1984-1991)
- 4-cylinder diesel 1.7 liter (1987-1991)

now, as we all know, only time and money stand between a car and the
installation of any engine. :)  since people have put Subaru engines into
vanagons, there is no reason to deny the possibility of a 5-cylinder Watzit
being put into one.

my guess is that it was the Super Neato Oettinger U:berBus, though ...
wish i could have seen it.
