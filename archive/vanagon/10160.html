Subject: Re: Re[2]: IMPORTING A BRAZILIAN BUS-?

&gt;H Steven Dolan sez:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;To import an automobile into the US, it must meet the US standards
&gt;&gt;as of the date the automobile was manufactured, not designed. Alas, the
&gt;&gt;Brazilian busses are not importable, without *major* mods. . .
&gt;
&gt;This brings up a news report I heard about a year ago. According to the
&gt;report,
&gt;VW of Mexico had designed a version of the bug that totally meets all US EPA
&gt;and
&gt;DOT requirements (reinforced doors &amp; drivers side airbag no less). The report
&gt;said VWoM was anticipating that the passage of NAFTA would allow them to build
&gt;a
&gt;rather profitable business importing this car into the US. Supposedly, with
&gt;the
&gt;passage of NAFTA, all that stood in their way was approval from corporate HQ
&gt;in
&gt;Germany.
&gt;
&gt;Did anyone else hear about this, or was it all just a weird dream? As I have
&gt;heard nothing about this since, my guess is that the whole deal was scrapped
&gt;in
&gt;favor of the new &quot;bug&quot;.SNIP

if that was a weird dream, i'd like to be part of it (heh, heh!)
