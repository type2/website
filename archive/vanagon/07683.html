&gt;     With all this talk of partitions between cab and back area, I've gotta 
&gt;     tell you about my mates panel van. It's a '66 Panel with twin sliding 
&gt;     doors (ooo, rare) and has a factory fitted partition between the cab 
&gt;     and the loading area. It looks something like:
&gt;     
&gt;       _____________
&gt;     /     ____     \ 
&gt;     |    |____|    |
&gt;     |              |
&gt;      -------------- 
&gt;     
&gt;     Yep that's a little window to see through as well. It's the only one 
&gt;     I've seen but it's genuine. I figure you can make one from some 
&gt;     hardboard (you know the 3 mm thick cardboard stuff that the door 
&gt;     panels are made from), cut a hole for a window, and perhaps nail some 
&gt;     upright wood to it for rigidity. I've got a spare rear hatch glass 
&gt;     which would make a cool window, just use a window rubber out of a 
&gt;     bread-loaf bus that had NONE-factory side windows - the ones that 
&gt;     stick out.

Thats what mine looked like, but I made mineout of canvas, without the 
window.  I think early panel busses all came with these.  Even the
model panel I have has it!
