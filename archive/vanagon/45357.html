I agree.  I remember when I first go on Internet back in 1991.  (Remember 
those days???...only college students and professors)  Back then it 
didn't seem like anyone cared too much.  I still don't care about 
subjects and all that jazz.  Actually, I get a kick out of scanning every 
message and seeing if there isn't some little tidbit of info that I can 
glean (regardless of the topic).  That's why when I write a big article 
to the list, I post a &quot;Bonus Note&quot; at the end.  It's kind of a thank you 
for reading despite what the topic is.  I think someday, just for spite, 
I'll shell out $10,000+ for a turnkey complete Berg engine, then I'll 
post something to the 'serv with the topic like &quot;What's a gear shift?,&quot; 
or &quot;What's a FAQ?,&quot; but then the content of the message will say, &quot;Be the 
first to respond and you get a Free Berg Engine.&quot;
