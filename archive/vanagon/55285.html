Subject: 12V Space Heater (The Sequel)


Thanks for the many responses.  I saw the heater in the Damark Catalogue 
(thanks Jerry/Jim), looks like it would be good if you had no heat in the 
back and used it while driving.  When camping, I usually wish I had a 
little more heat (w/o starting engine) after I turn the stove off and get ready to 
sleep.  Most of my weekend warrior excursions take place near home where 
it is not too cold.  I was hoping a very small electrical heater could 
heat up the small interior of the van using aux batt power.  The general 
concensus seems to be that it would take far too much power to create 
substantial heat (makes sense, wishful thinking on my part).

I would love one of those OE gasoline heaters.  Previous posts gave me the 
impression that they are hard to find used (hard to install?) and 
expensive to buy new.  How about propane?  Are there small, self 
contained propane heaters availible?  Can they be safely hooked-up to the 
existing propane system (I have the fridge and stove)?  I look forward to 
the greater wisdom that is the list.
