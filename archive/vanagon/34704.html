Subject: Syncro Tranny Status/Diff Lock Controls

Hi All,

In early Jan I posted about my seized syncro tranny.  Thanks to all for the
great hints and contacts.

It turns out a local mechanic (Harleysville, PA) actually found me a used
unit.  Actually another client of his found a burned wreck in a local yard,
from which he took the engine and I got the tranny.  Cost:  $600

It turned out to be an upgrade for me.  This unit has the diff lock which I
did not have before.  Which brings me to another question.  Anyone know of
sources for the control pieces for the difff lock??  From Bentley it looks like
I need vacuum tubing, a vacuum cannister, dash switch and indicator lights.  I
supposed I could fabricate from non-VW parts if I need to.

Now to dive into the seized tranny and find out what really happened inside.
Has anyone really rebuilt own without all th special tools depicted in the
Bentley manual?  I have rebuilt TR-3 transmissions, but I suspect this will be
a touch mor complicated!! Now that mine is running again, I have time to work
on this (I hope!).

Thanks again for all the feedback I received,

Kerry  '86 syncro
