Subject: 85 Oil Warning

Hey vanagoners, long time no see...

Came back from vacation yesterday and cranked up the 85 westy only to see an
oil light steadily burning on the dash.  Checked oil level and it was normal,
right between the marks.(although I noticed my coolant level a little high)
 Shut off the car and tried not to think about it for a day.

Got home from work today and saw the same thing. Curses.

Question.   Can this be something other than a bad light, ie bad oil pump,
leak in the system (no oil under car), or am I probably looking at a failing
guage?

Can I drive it two miles to a garage, or do I break out that Auto vantage
club card and get a tow?

I don't keep up with the list anymore, as I now have a job, (National
Geographic Studio Photographer) so private email would be appreciated.  I
will post the ultimate dispensation of the problem when it occurs.

Thanks
Peter &amp; Zippy.
