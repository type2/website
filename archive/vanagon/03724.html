Subject: Re: Ball Joint Removal Tool

The scissor type tool that presses out the joint is best, but they tend to 
break or bend if you use too much force. I have used a pickle fork 
attatchment on an air-chisel. Works great on really stuborn joints but its a 
last resort. Joints sometimes pop apart after a stategically aimed tap with 
a hammer on the end of the torsion arm. But if a light tap doesn't work 
straight away, whacking the hell out of it wont either. Get a proper tool 
instead.
