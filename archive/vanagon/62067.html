Subject: Yokohama Y-370s

Suzy's new 1976 Transporter is almost through its motor rebuild and will take
its place as her daily driver in the next week or two.

The PO mounted a new set of Yokohama Y-370s, and I have breezed through a few
370-related e-mails in the past month. Other list members apparently believe
these are the Tire Messiah. Why? What makes these perfect for these vehicles?

ALSO: I recall word of running the Tire Pressure at 65 lbs. Correct? For
daily driving or only under heavy load? What about in HOT climates, we travel
down to/in Baja and it can be scorching.

Thanks in advance.
