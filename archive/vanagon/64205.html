&gt;I use a submersible pump inside a 10-gallon tank, and I've
&gt;noticed that the plastic pipe inside the tank feels slimy.
&gt;Also, the wire leading to the pump develops small deposits
&gt;of green mould or algae. It's the correct type of pipe, and the
&gt;wire is that which came with the pump.

   You need to disinfect the tank.  Using 1/4 cup of chlorine bleach for
each 15 gallons of water, pour a diluted solution into a partially filled
tank, fill the rest of the way, and run the faucet.

    Leave the solution in the tank for three hours, then drain and flush.
To remove any remaining chlorine taste/odor, dissolve 1/2 cup of
baking soda in a gallon of very hot water, making sure all the baking
soda is dissolved.  leave the mixture in the tank overnight.  Drain and
flush.

   My water lines required replacing 'cuz I could not remove the crud
which was inside 'em.  I believe it might have resulted from my former
habit of filtering water going into the tank, removing the chlorine, thus
giving nasty critters carte blanche to grow in the tank and lines.  Now
my habit is to just fill the tank and  filter it through a Britta
pitcher.
