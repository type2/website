Subject: Re: Overheating

Newer rads (including Vanagon's) are plastic and aluminum.  Instead
of soldering, the tanks are crimped on and a rubber gasket is used in between.

Some rad shops won't deal with them.  It takes a special machine to crimp
the thing back together and then you run the risk that the &quot;ears&quot; will
fatigue and the crimp won't hold.  Shop carefully for a good radiator shop!

Also, I imagine that this maybe a one shot deal.  The next time you'll
need a whole new radiator.

 &gt;As I understand it, rodding the radiator involves unsoldering the upper 
 &gt;and lower tanks, then running special rods down each tube. It is supposed 
 &gt;to be the right treatment when the radiator is clogged but not badly 
 &gt;corroded itself. I was prepared to buy a new radiator, but the radiator 
 &gt;shop (who I've done business with for year) suggested the rodding 
 &gt;instead. It has woked great.  Even at 110 degrees ambiant temperature, the 
 &gt;needle stays over the little red light. (I also changed the fan switch 
 &gt;and ALL radiator hoses...now that was expensive!)
