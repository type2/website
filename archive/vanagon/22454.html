Subject: Hitch survey for vanagon
Date: Thu, 10 Aug 95 16:21:43 EDT

I'm looking for a hitch for my '82 Westy, and called around locally
to see what is availible:

Draw tite 	$99.50 Bolt on (U-haul)

Reese 		$55.75 ??????? (Most FLAPS) Listed for 84-92

Delauney ?	$88.55 Bolt on (Or maybe Don Valley? I didn't catch the name.
				It was Canadian anyway)
				(Dayley trailer, a local trailer supply)

?????		$59.95 ??????? (Parts Place (Former Recycled bugs))

All these are class 1 hitches, fixed style (non receiver).

A few questions I couldn't get the local FLAPS to answer: 

-- Is the Reese a bolt on or weld on? 
-- Why isn't the Reese listed for '79-92 (ie why won't it fit my van?)

-- Who manufactures the Parts place hitch? Is it weld or bolt on?

I'm leaning towards the Reese hitch, since it would be the cheapest way
to solve my immediate towing need (400 lbs Hobie cat on 300 lbs trailer).
I would guess that it would fit my '82 also. If you know otherwise please
tell me.

I also searched for &quot;hitch&quot; in the list archives and found an interesting
thread on a class III receiver style hitch, custom made for the Vanagon.
That would allow me to mount one of those &quot;baskets&quot; or wheel-less trailers.
(Good to carry extra diesel, tire chains, and other rural travel accessories)
Derek, how easy was it to install? (ie did it slip right in, or did you have
to bend and fight with the metalwork to get it in?) Did anybody else on the 
list buy one of these? Are they still availible?

How much does one of those &quot;baskets&quot; you put in the receiver style hitch cost?
Who sells them?

Another though I had was to make a basket thing myself by bending a 1 1/2
or 2&quot; galvanized pipe into a shape which would be clamped on under the rear 
frame members under the bus, and extend out, under the bumper, to form a frame 
for a basket. A hitch ball could then easily just be bolted to the pipe. 
This ought to be more rigid than a receiver mount basket, which ounly mounts 
in one point. Any thoughts on this? Would it be a legal modification?

Building my own basket would be more of a long term project. (Just have
to fix x y z... first ;),...hmmm,...,:(

Thanks,
Martin

PS Other ideas to solve my immediate towing need are welcome. Used hitches?
Are there any &quot;universal&quot; hitches which could somehow be mounted?
