Subject:       Pop-tops and nuking thieves

Hello,
I am new to the list, I only discovered it last week and have been 
lurking since then.  I've got a '72 Bus with the Westy pop-top.  The 
question I have is will a '78 Westy top fit onto my '72 bus.  The top 
I have is in very ragged condition, the fiberglass is very rough and 
the canvas top is in shredds.  I was at a junk yard the other 
day and they had a receint arrival of a '78 camper.  The top was in 
great shape and I could get quite a deal on both the fiberglass hard 
top and the canvas.  I know they pop up in opposite directions,
but if I just flip it around will it bolt right on?

Is this going to too much trouble?  Would it be simpler to just 
purchase a canvas top, install it myself and repaint the 
fiberglass?  Does anyone know where I can buy the canvas top?
How much do they cost and how easy are they to install?  On both the 
tops the rubber seal is shot, where can I find one of these and how 
much do they cost?  I guess I need a really good catalogue of 
Volkswagen parts, any suggestions?
 
Thanks in advance,
Howard
