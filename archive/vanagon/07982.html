&gt; proposed on net was to replace the motor with an one of the automatic
&gt; transmission versions, which are self supporting.  A friend of my 
&gt; father's turned out to have a working ATR starter motor among his spares, 
&gt; so I tried this.
&gt; 
&gt; Result:
&gt; 
&gt; Don't do it.  The gear on the ATR starter motor does not extend as far as 
&gt; the the manual trans version. and does not engage the flywheel. Oh, well, 
&gt; back to the hill.
&gt; 

I have one of these starters on my '68 Westy.  Had one on my '73 Ghia.  
Never had any problems with not engaging the flywheel.

What's going on here?
