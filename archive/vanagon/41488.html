Subject: Re: air flap question

I know that when the thermostat goes the flaps should be open, but my van 
has been heating up lately and I want to make sure that its not the flaps 
should the lever be pushed toward the front of the van or back?

&gt; &gt;I have a n 82 vanagon and was wondering which way the flaps should be 
&gt; &gt;wired? Should the handle that the spring is attached be pushed toward the 
&gt; &gt;front of the van or the back. My therostat is toast and need to wire the 
&gt; &gt;flaps until I get a new one. 
&gt; 
&gt; The spring will hold the flaps in the wide open position.  The thrmostat and
&gt; cable pulls them closed when cold and contracted.
