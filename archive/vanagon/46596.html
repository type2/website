I've got everybody but these two:

WILLIAM.WARBURTON/OU=TRITEC_at_DSW.GOVT.NZ
TAFENSW/ISPO021/SJUNOR_at_MSMAIL.TAFENSW.EDU.AU

The server chokes on them, maybe because they have slashes. Durn
foreigners. ;) If you hear from them, send them on to me. I'll take it up
with Primenet in the morning.

I did get these three, too, which you had asked me to add to the long list:

VANAGON_LIST_at_DESIGNET.CO.UK
ARPALISTS+LISTSERV.VANAGON_at_ANDREW.CMU.EDU
VANAGON_at_AUTOMATRIX.COM

So I guess that's it!

Thanks,

--Ken
