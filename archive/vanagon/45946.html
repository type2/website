&gt; just before I was about to quit satisfied, it demonstrated its

&gt;   If someone knows of a device that also uses this standard appearing 12V

&gt;   Also, in what interchangable years were these little submergable pumps 
&gt; used?
&gt;   Is there an inexpensive alternate source for acceptable replacements 
&gt; beside the maximally priced VW dealership?
&gt;   If others have found nice little two speed replacements, that would be 
&gt; a fine improvement.

You say your '83 has the submersible type? Interesting... The '83 
which I almost bought last year had the pump mounted in the 'secret' 
compartment in the bottom of the kitchen cabinet. It looked factory 
to me - maybe it wasn't. Anyway, I used this method to replace my 
pump which failed the same way as yours. A $25 RV sink pump mounted 
nicely in this compartment, insulated with a few foam pieces to keep 
it from rattling too much. Flow rate is not bad, better than the 
dying pump I had, but still takes about 45-60 seconds to fill the 
kettle. (heck, if I'm rushing when camping, there's *something* 
wrong!)

One main problem with this: Since the water line comes through the 
top of the tank, the pump will lose its prime if the tank is emptied, 
or near empty and driving up *steep* hills (as I often do...). I've 
gotten used to mouth-priming the pump - no big deal. The RV place I 
got the pump at sold a 3/8&quot; check valve to fix this - I skipped it 
since I thought I had one already. The white thingy under the sink is 
just a coupler - not a valve. Another solution would be the more 
expensive self priming pump, but it was about $80...

ps: I left stock wiring in place so I could go back to the old pump 
type - just disconnected the 4 prong connector under the sink for 
power from the faucet, then ran a ground wire to a cabinet mounting 
screw. 

pps: You'll also need about 2-3' of 3/8&quot; tubing to extend the lines 
to the pump, and lengthen the feed line in the tank.
