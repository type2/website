Subject: Correction: FS 93 EV Weekender $17.4K

     Perusal of the archives and curiousity, plus another
     consult with the seller, confirms that this is a
     Weekender, not a full Westfalia Camper (which were not
     imported by VWOA).

     Again, the contact is Fred Stoner (703) 218-4669. Its in Fairfax
     VA, near Washington.
