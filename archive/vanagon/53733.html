Subject: starter problems 82 diesel

I just had my starter rebuilt by a shop here on cape cod, but have 
recently had problems with occasional no-starts. I assumed the starter 
was defective, but the guy who rebuilt it told me that I may need a relay 
because of the distance betwwen the ignition and starter. I'm not sure... 
any ideas?
