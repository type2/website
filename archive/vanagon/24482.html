Subject: EuroVan Fornt Seats

    I have a '93 EV and both front seats sort of rock back and forth 
just a little.  I have traced it down to two things. 


    1.  The tracks which the entire seat slides in has a little play 
which might account for this. and...
    2.  The rotary seat adjusters, you know the knobs you turn to 
adjust the angle of the seatback; well there seems to be excessive play 
in them.

    I didn't see any adjustments for these things and would appreciate 
any help, comments, or new seats (recarro is good).
