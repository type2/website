Subject: Why was #820 11 pages?

I just got Digest # 820 and it was 11 pages.  Anyone know why?  Pages 5-11
were gibberish.  I'm going to trash those pages unless someone can tell me
what it means.  Thanks.


P.S.  Don't forget chat nite on &quot;The Undernet&quot;  Channel Volkswagen.  Friday
starting at 6pm est.    Take care.
