&gt;&gt;Yes, but what is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
&gt;
&gt;depends on how many coconuts he's carrying. if he's an African Swallow,
&gt;of course. :)


Anyone game for a re-rendering of the &quot;Quainte Tale of the Thirde Brake
Light&quot;? If you want a copy, Email me privately-- it's kinda long. A take-off
on the Hideous Beast that Guards the Cavern. First one who asks, gets a
free copy. Second place, two copies. Etc.
