No.  You have to remove those screws to get the motor off, but you still 
have to break the case.

The motor appears to work. I don't have a VOM fine enough to test the  
resistor, but it's not open, so does that mean it's probably ok?  If the 
resistor was bad, would the fan not work or would it only work on high?

I'll test the switch next.  The other reason I tore into this was that we
were getting an odor of coolant when the temp got up there, but I can see
no sign of coolant anywhere.  Is it possible that it's leaking and
evaporating that fast and only under pressure?  There was plenty of air in
the thing.
