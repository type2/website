Subject: AFM, etc...

I'd be happy to mail one of the 22mfd tantalum capacitors to the first person to
send me an address.  Its a 35 volt cap, came in a two-pack, and of course I only
need the one for the AFM wiring harness fix.

Also, has anyone on the list tried the re-manufactured AFMs from a company
called &quot;Fuel Injectors Inc.&quot;?  A parts place called JAX gets them from
California, and they're cheaper than Bosch re-mans ($186 vs. $260).  I'd like to
know.

Thanks.
