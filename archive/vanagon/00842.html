Subject: dangerous fume from battery


Hi,

I am sharing this info to you for your own safety. 

For several months, inside the passanger compartment of the '83 Vanagon,
I could always smell vinegar. I just found out its 5-year old battery's
fluid leaked. (The battery is located under the front passenger seat.)
To be fumigated in an acid fume chamber for months is not the best thing
I expected.

I am amazed by this kind of hazardous design (to have the battery inside
the passanger compartment) from VW.

Do you know a successful liability case lawyer? Ha...ha...

Regards,

James
