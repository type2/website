&gt;   &gt; does anyone know if there was ever a walk thru dormbile offered on
&gt;   pre 1968 busses??
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; On a similar vein does anyone know if walkthru 23 or 21 windows were
&gt;   offered? If they were I see no 
&gt;   &gt; reason that a walk thru Dorm. could not have been made?
&gt;   
&gt;   THere was a walk-thru 23 for sale about 2 weeks ago. $2500, but it
&gt;   was rusty.

Kevin Murray is stealing my '63 23-Window Walk-Thru very soon now.
