Regarding my posting of mis understanding what is funny.

My apologies to all on the list that had to endure reading a non vanagon
joke.

I had not realized that the funny stuff was supposed to still be vanagon
related.

although the Panda bear was walking out to his 85 vanagon with the Audi
5000 engine you have all been dreaming about.

just failed to mention that! :-)
