Subject: On the horns of a dilemma

Here is the problem.....


I have the opportunity of buying a VW camper van  (1800cc -1973 vintage- 
twin carb) Not too sure of its correct name type, but if anybody has a
copy of &quot;Volkswagen Bus-Camper-Van  1968-1979&quot; compiled by R.M. Clarke,
Brooklands Books, it looks very like the one on page 33.

Considering its age and the salted roads and temperate climate here in
the UK then it's not in too bad a shape. It looks fairly standared, not
too much bodging, and certainly in great shape on the inside.

B U T (and it could be a big BUT or little but) it comes with an 
automatic gearbox ('transmission' for those that are separated by our 
common language), and it is this that has given me the dilemma.

If the gearbox was manual I would purchase the van, in the knowledge 
that I could easily pick up a second hand gearbox if it gave problems. 
Now I know the automatic has a bigger market in the USA


Questions
=========
The automatic unit is a rare beast on this side of the world, I have 
managed to track down a second hand unit in a scrapyard costing UK200 
pounds (US $300 ? ?) How does this price compare in the USA

Does the purchase of a 24 year old transmission unit seems like a wise 
thing to do?? Has the automatic transmission on the VW a good 
reputation?

I take it that the engine on the automatic gearbox is the same as on a 
manual??  (If I need to change the engine will I encounter any problems, 
or is it just a straight swap?)

If I choose to replace the automatic unit with a manual one, is this a 
formidable job (considering linkage, cables, foot pedal etc etc)?



I am sure I have a million other questions (well a few anyway) before I 
commit myself to buying.... I am moving closer to the precipice as the 
weather begins to pick up and the daffodils begin to appear.

Thanks in advance for any words of wisdom or tales of woe.
