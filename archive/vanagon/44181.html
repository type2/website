&gt;To all of you bus owners with CBs, where did you mount them?  Please note the
&gt;year of you bus/vanagon so I picture the dash setup.

i've mounted mine, in both 71/73 buses and in vanagons, on the side of the
underseat-storage under the passenger seat, in the walk-through between the
front seats. this allows me to reach down with my right hand and get the
microphone without having to take my eyes off the road. and the microphone
cord doesn't dangle from the dash on my legs or get in the way of the
parking brake (yeah, i tried that in my 71 bus). :)
