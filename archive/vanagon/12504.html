&gt; i was actually impressed with the bus ... but my left foot sure felt funny,
&gt; and i'd keep stabbing at air with that foot every time i came up to a stop.


Reading Joel's remark while watching the 1st and 2nd graders doing the 
Hookie-Pookie

put your left foot in,,,,take your left foot out,,,,put your left foot in
and shake it all about.....

(come on everyone....YOU can do it!)

put your right foot in, take your right foot out, put your left foot in and 
shake it all about
