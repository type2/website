One thing to look out for especially with a Turbo.

You can't make Horsepower with air and in the case of a Diesel this is
especially true.  While turbocharging a Diesel will clean up the smoke,
you'll actually lean out the engine without the corresponding increase in
fuel metering.  Keep the boost conservative (if you have a boost gauge) of
less than 8PSI for street use.  If you have a pyrometer keep the
temperature below 950F.  A change in boost from 7 to 10 PSI static will
render an increase in intake manafold temp of 170 degrees at 80F ambient.

I've turboed quite a few rabbits without much difficulty if I stay within
these parameters.
