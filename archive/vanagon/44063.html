&gt; I understand the 4WD systems on the Audis to be different from the VWs.
&gt; The Synchro system used on Vanagons, Golfs (&amp; presumably other VWs)
&gt;is designed to improve traction on slippery surfaces (Snow, Mud) and so
&gt;increase the versatility of the vehicle at low speeds  whereas the Quattro
&gt;system on Audis is designed to boost traction on pavement at higher
&gt;speeds with a view to improving performance. I think the systems are built
&gt;differently because of these different (though overlapping) design goals.

Some call it Syncro, some call it Quattro....isn't that a song or something.
 
Speaking of models imported to the USA, there's the Vanagon Syncro that uses
a viscous coupling to attach the transmission to the front pair of wheels.
 The coupling acts like an automattically engaging differential that will
lock when the rear tires begin to loose traction.  Then, there's the Quantum
Syncro.  Since VW choose the name Syncro to market their all-wheel-drive
offerings, they applied the name to the Quantum as well even though the
Quantum used the Quattro system from the Audi 4000.  The Quantum and the 4000
being very similar cars, including their drivetrains, it was simple for VW to
start selling a Quantum Syncro without designing a new drivetrain for it.
