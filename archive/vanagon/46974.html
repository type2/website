I replaced a 120K 1.9 with a 46K 2.1 and yes I can definitley feel the
difference.
It was a fairly straightforward job.
you need to use the distributor from the 1.9 and a few other small bits for
the injection.
the biggest hassle was adapting the hoses from the junction box on the
passenger side to the
tubes to the radiator. It is doable.
Good Luck.
