Subject: RE: Shocks..are these good ones?


Jon,
I've had problems locating shocks for my syncro.  Was going to mail order 
KYB's and BOGE for my van ($44 and $89 respectively) when i found that Trak 
auto sells Monroe Magnum sensi track for my vehicle _at_ $36 each.  they are a 
heavy duty gas charged road sensing shock with a lifetime warranty.
later,

relax and spin
87 syncro
