       Reply to:RE&gt;&gt;Re: 84 random hiccup
I disagree (maybe).  On my 88 Westie the infamous '$100.00 wiring harness
capacitor thing' fixed a problem on my van which sounds similar but not exactly
the same.  The harness thing fixed a complete loss of power until the van
wouldn't run at all and I had to pull over.  I agree with the others that this
is the first thing to try (it's cheaper than any other fix) but I wouldn't rule
out the air flow meter.  Those tend to be particularly sensitive to gas pedal
position.

If the wiring harness thing doesn't fix the problem, let me know.  I have an
extra air flow meter for my 88 (bought it before I replaced the ECU-ouch!).  If
the part number is the same you may be able to borrow it for troubleshooting.

If you know someone with the same year as yours, ask them to borrow their ECU
for a day.  Might just fix the problem too.
