&gt; &gt; &gt; the new VW's are not an option, as she refuses to consider automatics.

Thats a bit scary.  My bro has a Dodge.  Its great for giggles at his 
expense... 

&gt; 	I've thought for quite a while, if I did have kids, I'd want a Eurovan MV
&gt; VR6 with
&gt; 	the weekender package (poptop, cooler, mid-rig table).

Who needs the 6.  5 is plenty.  Haven't hit 100 yet but cruising 80 
without breaking a sweat is fine for power.  Highest I've gone so far is 
I think about 95.  That is mph. &lt;grin&gt;

Skip the cooler  seat - get one to run off the cigarette lighter so you can 
take it out of the van for picnics.  Holds more too.  

Poptop would be nice but you lose the rear A/C vents.  Its a toss up 
really depending upon the weather were you drive.

Table's handy.  A bit short but it suffices.

EV MV non-weekender might turn out near perfect.  Did for us.  Only wish 
I have is syncro...  Lots of mud and snow in the Virginia mountains 
sometimes.
