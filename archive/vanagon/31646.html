Subject: Pick One, Dammit

I took a quick look at a '69 Double-Cab Pickup today.  Been sitting 
(outside) since 1984, originally from Florida, now sitting way out in the 
Ozarks wilderness.  Body not too bad ... some new metal at the bottom of 
the gates and in the rockers (not a professional job), nose on drivers 
side corner was in about an inch before being pulled back out.   Good 
(complete) interior, nice headliner, floors solid.  Motor &quot;ran good when 
I parked it&quot; (turns over).  The owner made it sound *much* nicer over the 
phone (he still sees it as it might have been 11 years ago) and was 
saying things like &quot;I saw one in California for $2500&quot;...  (*I* would pay 
$1500 to $2000, even tho' the ones in HVWs classifieds were $8900 and 
$14,500 [restored]).  Problem is ... I'm getting ready to start restoring 
my '60 Double-Door Panel (which *is* my birth year) and a Panel is fairly 
cheap to restore (well, compared to a Deluxe Sunroof or Rusty's Westy)...  
But the Panel won't haul my family of 5 unless I put a seat in the back 
(and I don't want to do that).  I also have a line on a '60 Double-Door 
Kombi (seats for the kids and windows to see what I'm about to hit as I 
change lanes) that has an asking price of $1400.  All these VWs are in 
similar unrestored (or old-restored) condition and each has the 
uniqueness that I like and tho' I could *probably* buy all of them, that 
is as far as the funds would go and I'd have three projects instead of 
one good Bus (sound familiar?)...  

What are your opinions as far as practicality vs. restorablity.  Which 
one should I choose?
