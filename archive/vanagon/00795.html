Subject: Re:  Seats for a '78 bus

Dan I put a pair of nice vanagon seats in my '77 - slid right in 
with out a hitch.  Paid $65 for the pair.  I'm not sure what year
the vanagon was.   Pull one of yours out (slide it off the track)
and then go to your friendly local junkyard and see what you can
find!
