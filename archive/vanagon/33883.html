Subject: Re: 62 dust-caps (front)

&gt; I assume you're looking
&gt;at and trying to remove the dust caps.
&gt;
&gt;        Try using a rubber mallet or something else soft- plastic-headed
&gt;mallet, hit the cap solidly from the top or side, maybe pulling the hammer
&gt;toward yourself as it his so the impact tries to pull the cap out.
&gt;There ought to be a ridge that prevents the cap from going deeper into
&gt;the hole at the center of the drum- if you can get a screw-driver blade
&gt;onto the gap between the drum and the ridge and hammer on it, you may
&gt;be able to lever the cap up that way.

        Ooooh, I just like to use the claw end of the hammer on the dust
cap.  One little POP! and it's off.  Maybe 2 POP!s sometimes, the second on
the opposite side.
