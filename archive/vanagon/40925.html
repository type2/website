Subject: Re: hmm, is this bad? could it hurt?(lost spark plug)

Hey John,
  wouldn't worry. when I dropped the engine last time in my 73 bus I found
an old spark plug rolling around on the cooling fins. looked ancient, must
have been in there for awhile without doing any damage. if you decide you
wanna get rid of it you'll have to remove the fan housing. good opportunity
to clean all the cooling fins and clean the oil cooler (inside and out!) and
reinstall it with new rubber seals (watch it! they're a very low torque
item if i recall correctly!). but as i said, i wouldn't worry about it until
you drop the engine next time...  ciao,
            gregor

             &gt; hey now, &gt; &gt;
hmm, when changing my spark plugs today one fell out of the ratchet and back
&gt; into the spark plug housing. i tried to get it out with pliers but only
&gt; succeeded in pushing it back where i can't even see or feel it. i shrugged and
&gt; put the new plug in, started up the engine and went to work. i'm extremely
&gt; paranoid now. could that spark plug in there do major harm? how do i get it
&gt; out?
