&gt;How does one remove a '67 steering wheel without breakage? Special tool? I

&gt;wheel. It's pointed about 1:00 o'clock and if I'm even in an accident, I
&gt;expect serious rib injuries with it this way (less compliant).

The wheel on my bus ('66) is locked to the steering shaft with a woodruff
key, not splines.  As such, the only way to center the wheel is with the
tie-rod like link that connects the steering box to the swing arm.
