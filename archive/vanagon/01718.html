Subject: Re: what color?

I wasn't gonna reply to this, 'cuz who cares what color my bus is, but
since we now have the hubcaps issue ;-)

74 bus, originally orange-n-white, now painted as a brick wall (red and
grey primer).  Hubcaps?  Black and school-bus yellow smiley faces over
the original chrome salad bowls.  Hmm.  I can hear you east-coasters cringe.

cheers ;-),
