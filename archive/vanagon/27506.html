&gt; Automobile-based &quot;planning&quot; has created cities where it is considered 
&gt; acceptable to spend a couple of hours in the morning, and a couple of 
&gt; hours in the evening, crawling along a clogged highway with a few other 
&gt; hundred thousand similarly herded unfortunates.  Maybe the situation is 
&gt; worse in the vancouver area than elsewhere, but rush-hour travel time by 
&gt; car from, say , downtown to a major suburb like Surrey or Twawwassen is 
&gt; at least 1 1/2 hours and usually more since some bozo typically runs out 
&gt; of gas in the middle of a critical bridge along the way.  Three hours or 
&gt; more every day driving in rush hour traffic jams?  

And thats not all. With typical suburban living comes a lot of extra
work maintaining the house, and mowing the (now days at least 1+ acre)
lawn. Is it worth it? The neighbor on my left I've seen out in her
back yard exactly once this past year. That was when I was climbing up a 
fairly tall tree to prune some branches. I guess she was curious to see if 
I was going to fall down. She has absolutely nothing in her yard (other than
the lawn, which is taken care of by a lawn service), no trees, vegetable
of flower gardens. It's just a piece of unused flat lawn.

To my right the situation is pretty much the same, although this neighbor
at least get some good exercise from mowing his own lawn once a week.
Other than that, he doesn't have any enjoyment of owning a piece of land.
I think many people like these would be a lot better off living in 
space efficient apartments, and our cities could get a lot smaller,
and so would the need for transportation. But of course, that's not 
fashionable. Only poor and unfortunate people live in apartments here. 
Living in an apartment is equivalent with not having enough income to get 
a mortgage.

Curiously, if you actually want to do something with the piece of
land, which comes with your suburban home, that's not allowed. Zoning 
regulations it's called. No one of the squares with a suburban soap box 
colonial on it is allowed to be different from the others. We are severely 
illegal when we let our pet ducks out in the back yard. One of the neighbors 
on the other side of the street is considered an odd ball because he has an old
TRW in his driveway, which he occasionally works on, instead of
the in this neighborhood mandatory Chevy Lumina. Fortunately my
vanagon (vw content :-) looks enough like a mainstream minivan, so I 
haven't had any problems like that yet. I can only imagine what would happen
if I had a hippie bus!

So why do I live there. Well apart from the other neighbors, I'm actually
growing something in my garden. And the illegal ducks like it too!
I have never commuted by car, always by bike. When I moved to Rochester I 
found out that there were a grand total of three bike paths serving the
metro population of 1 million or so. One path is newly built
&quot;for recreational purposes&quot; and goes from nowhere to nowhere. The
two others are just the old canal and river tow paths, which served
a transportation function in the last century, and can do so now also. 
For me the tow path is 3 out of my 4 mile daily commute. To most of my 
neighbors it is completely unknown. They think (and I'm not kidding) that 
I'm at home all day, since my car is in the driveway. Bikes are either for 
kids or something to decorate the corners of the two car garage with.

PS There was a Newsweek article earlier this fall on the future of
American suburban sprawl. Described it pretty much as caused by a vicious
circle demanding conformity in living and involving builders, brokers
and homeowners.
