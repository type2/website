     Mike,

     Its already up on the Old Bus Page, so just do a pointer to
     http://www.sky_dot_net/~rmk/images/jerry.gif/. VWofA also
     had it up at http://www.vw_dot_com, but right now their server
     seems to be down.

     Tom F.

No, I don't read Rolling Stone on a regular basis, but I was lucky
enough to find something of worth in it when I was reading the issue
about Jerry Garcia last weekend.

VW has the coolest ad in there.  It's a black Charcol pencil drawing
of a splittie with a blue teardrop coming out of one of the
headlights.  No words other than Jerry Garcia, 1942-1995.

I'll scan it in and put it on my Webserver.
