Subject: Bus Depot NOT affected by UPS strike
Date: Wed, 6 Aug 1997 17:04:32 -0400

I've gotten several calls and emails from list members about this.  I
posted the below to the Type 2 list, but the Vanagon list was down at the
time. 

Bus Depot shipments will NOT be affected by the UPS strike, no matter how
long it lasts.  Over a week ago, planning for the worst as my father always
taught me, I made arrangements in advance to service my customers via
FedEx, Burlington Air Express, Priority Mail, DHL Overnight, carrier
pidgeon, etc.  Shipments will continue as scheduled via these carriers. 
This will be at little or no additional cost to you.   Because I didn't
want to take any chances on my customer's parts being stuck in the UPS
pipeline during the strike, I have been using these alternate carriers for
over a week already.  Therefore, to my knowledge, there are NO customer
orders stuck in the UPS system at this time.  
 
It's business as usual at The Bus Depot.  Neither rain nor sleet nor UPS
strike will stand between you and your Volkswagen parts  :-)
