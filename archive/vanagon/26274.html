Subject: Re: A toast to Bob &amp; Grendel

dav&gt; All,
dav&gt;
dav&gt; Since it is appearent that Bob is going to be departing in a day
dav&gt; or so (if all goes well), I propose, partly to Bob, and mostly to
dav&gt; the rest of us mere mortals, that say 10 - 15 minutes before Bob
dav&gt; fires up Grendel for the trek into warmer (drier?) climes he
dav&gt; should send out a message to the list saying something to the
dav&gt; effect of &quot;10 minutes and counting&quot; and give the local time. We
dav&gt; all then get a glass of Beer,Wine,Cola, whatever your poison, and
dav&gt; when 10 minutes, or whatever interval (probably should be closer
dav&gt; to 15 or more), elapses we all hold up our glasses and say &quot;Good
dav&gt; Luck Bob &amp; Grendel&quot; (if someone could translate that into german
dav&gt; it would be all the better). With the sudden outpouring of good VW
dav&gt; karma, a new sense of being should flow into her and be more than
dav&gt; enough to carry her and Bob through the trials and tribulations of
dav&gt; the trip home.
dav&gt;
dav&gt; Just a thought
dav&gt;

        An excellent idea. And those of us who will be in the dark because
of our digest format will be sending good karma throughout the trip,
thereby ensuring that B&amp;G have a resonably uneventful return to the land of
comfortable tempratures and little rain.

        Viel Gluck, Mein KameradsVolkswagens. Und mien apologies for my
sloppy German...

Peace,
