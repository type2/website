Whoa there, unka joel. In my part of the country, braking for possums is 
akin to pickin' up some chicken on the way home. Granted if they've been

That's one of the main reasons you don't see all that many native Arkies 
with VW buses...kinda hard to lean out the door and pick up possums. 
Gotta pull over and git out.
