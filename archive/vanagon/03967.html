&gt; &gt;I used to own an '87 16V Scirocco, now I own a '70 bus(with a camper interior),
&gt; &gt;you could say it was like coming out of light speed!  I'm now the king 
&gt; &gt;of the right
&gt; &gt;lane.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Hey!!!  I thought *I* was the king of the right lane...

Y'all can fight for top spot, but with the leaky pushrods my '78 has, I 
want to be Duke of Earl.
