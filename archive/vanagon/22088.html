Subject: Generator Light: NoT

Okay, so I've driven about 75 miles now with no generator light (all flames
deserved). I'm absolutely certain that this is due to wiring, which was
adjusted by some third graders (Ah tink dey'd gradiated tird graed?) before
I bought the van. I have been able to get most things running properly, but
alas, no generator/alternator light (I don't even really know which I
have...which kindof tells on my edjycashun don'it?). Can anyone, by any
wild stretch, help me determine how the wiring should pan out in the engine
compartment of my '71?

Basically, there's a problem cluster of wires in a harness coming in under
the voltage regulator and running along the front of the fan housing toward
the distributor. I've figured out the wiring for the distributor and
carburator, but I've got a couple of &quot;spare&quot; wires on this harness (okay,
they're really just ufo's -- Unidentified Flopping Other wires). Maybe
there's a book with a really good picture of the wiring (I really do need
to get a Haynes, don't I?).

Any help will be appreciated; this being Friday, please feel free to singe
me on the careless no-generator-light-driving I've done; I'm in digest
mode, though 8)

Thanks! Joe Fournier
