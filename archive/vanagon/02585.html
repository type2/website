I have been talking about planning on buying a plane in a few years,
 of which my wife wants nothing to do with. Lately, I have been
 pointing out how similar looking light-plane engines are to VW
 air-cooled.

A long time ago there was a fake ad in some late 60s early 70s 
underground publication (could have been Whole Earth Catalog
or something) which claimed to offer, for $25 a &quot;Volkswagen
Conversion Kit.&quot;  This was a set of little wings that attached
to your bug and made it into a little plane.  Then (with beatiful
60s-style drawings (ala the Idiot book) it showed some hippie
guy thumbing his nose at a big traffic jam as he took off over
everyone's head.  Does anyone else remember this?
 
I guess as the child of a hippie mom I got VW obsession as a matter
of course.  I remember riding around in the back of VWs and
watching the road fly by through the rust holes in the floor.
