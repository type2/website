Subject: RE: Need auto-stop propane tank valve

Just to be absolutely clear:

Is propane supposed to escape with the bleed screw open whenever there is 
propane in the tank and not just when the tank is full (80%)?

If this is true, then how do you know when the tank is full when you are 
filling it? I suppose when it won't accept any more propane...

If anyone can provide a good description of the how and why of filling 
propane tanks that have the auto-stop feature, I would appreciate it. 
Whenever I get mine filled, the attendants don't have a clue.
