&gt; Hey!  Do any of you beltway bussers (and buggers) plan to attend the Bug Out

&gt; up at some point to do the pizza/beer/whatever thing.  My wife and I will be
&gt; coming down perhaps 2 days early in our 1974 Westy, and my brother will be
&gt; driving a (non-VW) pickup load of parts down for the swap meet.  (We may also
&gt; bring a 3rd vehicle full of parts if we can't cram everything into 2).  We
&gt; always camp at Bull Run regional park, and there's usually a BUNCH of VW people
&gt; camping there for the Bug Out.

Absolutely. Another physical meeting, this time with enough warning so 
that LOTS of folks can show up. We won't be camping, but will make it at 
least one day. Hopefully, /dev/bus will be de-rusted and painted by then...
Looking forward to it. (Got to find that middle stool that cam with the 
Westies).
