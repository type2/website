&gt; and ps.  The postcript print out readable and the jpeg are LARGE on 
&gt; netscape and readable via xv.  

GOD those things are huge!  Did you scan them as line art?  I found
that scanning as line art really makes the files smaller...  Also,
what compression setting are you using when converting them to Jpegs?
Might want to consider lowering it a bit.  I used 75% for the latest
batch of pics on the vw page, and even the largest ones are only about
30k.  Just some suggestions... :)
