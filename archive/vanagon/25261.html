Subject: Canadian Vs US parts prices

Bonjour Volks!

       Two weeks ago, one of the oil plugs in the casing (behind the flywheel) got out: big mess, all the blood drained out of Westy's engine. No
problem with the engine (in town, light came on) as i stopped immediately, and 
there seemed to be 4 liters of oil on the ground.

     Anyway, i want to overhaul the engine while it's out. Shopping for prices 
in Montreal, I could not find a ring set: it's got 93.47mm Mahle piston (0.020&quot;
oversize). Nobody has that. So, i looked for suppliers in the States: all parts 
i need are about half price, ie P/C set 199 $US VS 399 C$, same for bearings, 
gaskets...

    Any Canadians out there import parts? Any real savings, accounting for 
exchange rate (1 $C = .73$US), duty, brokerage, etc ?      

    What about mail order. Anybody bought from MOFOCO? Quality? Any others?


Thanks,

P.S.   Ordered the rings from Hastings, 55 $C   (2-3 weeks to manufacture...)
