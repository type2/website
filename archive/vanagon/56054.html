Does anyone know anything about Busbones/Kevin Murray?

I ordered (and sent a money order) to him for a '67 wiper motor and switch
over a month ago and have'nt seen or herad anything!

I spoke to him once about a week and a half ago and he said it was on it's
way, but...

Now I can't get anyone to answer the phone. Oh, and by the way, Ma Bell
doesn't even have a listing for a company called Busbones, just a personal
residence for one Kevin Murray listed at the street address on his web
page. What gives???

Anyone know anything?

BTW, this is the second time I've gotten taken by ordering via the
net/phone and sending money first. From now, I'm paying the extra couple
couple of bucks and having it sent COD!!
