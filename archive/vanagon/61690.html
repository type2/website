Just had new tires put on our '87 Westy.  Got what I think is a deal on the
Yoykohama Y370 LT195/75R14 &quot;D&quot; load range 8 plys for $98. CND each,
installed, at Treffs Auto Center on Carling Ave., Ottawa, Ontario.  They
replaced four Sears Supergaurd LT195/75R14 part #67339 which we had
installed in April of '95. milage: 73,600 km.  They were $93.99 each plus 
$2.50 for the valve stem and $8.50 for balancing so the overall price was
much higher than the Yoko's. From the posts to this list I understand the
Yoko's to be the best bet for the Vanagon.  So far they seem to have made
a world of differnce in the ride, much smoother.  Milage we'll see !  I
had expected higher milage from the Sears.  They were trouble free but
were not the best riding.  They were rough and the van would sway alot in
heavy winds.  Hope the Yoko's do better.  Now I've got to change the left
ball joint to get an alignment, news I got yesterday from the tire shop. 
More work for this week !

Cheers

Frank
