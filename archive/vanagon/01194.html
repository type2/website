Subject: RE: Source required for engine rubber seal

&gt;From: Steve Miller &lt;stevemil_at_uoguelph_dot_ca&gt;

&gt;I require the seal that goes around the outside of the engine tin 
&gt;between the engine and the engine compartment (body).  The local VW guy 
&gt;here in Guelph (Ontario, Canada) wants 90$.  I find this alittle high for 
&gt;this peice of foam rubber.  Anyone know where I could get it cheaper or a 
&gt;way to substitute?  TIA

You may be able to use water pipe insulation available at hardware/home
supply places.  I used it to seal our bus years ago and it worked very
well.
