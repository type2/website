Subject: Re: Cooling tin orientation.

Hi AAron,
  I was worriiedmabout the same thing when I had my engine out last summer.
I believe they only go in one way and it'll be obviuous. 2 other ideas
though:
    * buy a bag of new engine tin screws, the old ones are usually ruined.
    * someone on the list suggested to paint the tins before reinstallment.
i did that one day when i was too lazy to do any serious work. just
rummaged through the shop, grabbed all old\used\half empty spray paint cans
i could find and did it to my tins...still makes me smile every time i open
the engine room lid...
    enjoy,
                Gregor

Aaron wrote the other day:
&gt; In my inexperienced beginnings of rebuilding my
1700cc engine(before
&gt; reading Muir and the Hoover Sermons) I took of the cooling tins and
&gt; engine covering tins without drawing pictures or taking pictures or
&gt; ever really paying attention to how they go on.  I am not ready to
&gt; put them back on yet, but when I am I don't know if I will be able to
&gt; do it right.  Is there any book that gives a good picture of how all
&gt; the tins are assembled? Is there anyway to find out how they go on
&gt; without acting like the whole thing is a jigsaw puzzle.  Please help,
&gt; Thanks.
