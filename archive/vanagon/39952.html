&gt;Also, he told me about a guy in Texas who makes canvas replacements for old 
&gt;westfalias.  Does anyone know his name?  Mine is completely gone. 
Ernest. (Austin, TX?) (the word Cordello comes to mind when I think of 
this guy, but I'm not sure why. Weird, meaningless free association, I 
guess).
Was that much help? Guess not.

A few years ago, JCWhitney had his stuff for sale in the catalog, and I 
think it still is.
