&gt;Ok Folks,
&gt;
&gt;  My son (13) had a hissy fit last night about NuBus ('82 Diesel).
&gt;These were some of his quotes:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;I Hate that freaking car&quot;
&gt;
&gt; &quot;It's so ugly&quot;
&gt;
&gt; &quot;It's so loud&quot;  &quot;It's so stupid&quot;  &quot;I'd rather walk&quot;
&gt;
&gt;He is embarrassed when he is seen in the bus; not
&gt;because of its condition, but because it is a VW.
&gt;
&gt;He threatened to ignore us if we picked him from the
&gt;school dance tonight in the bus...
&gt;
&gt;So, am I alone with this? Any net.experience on remoulding
&gt;recalcitrant posterity?

I'll count myself among the lucky.  Chris (age 13.7) and his friends think
that Otto (the 79) is &quot;pretty cool&quot;.  Frau Blucher (the Camper) is &quot;way
cool&quot; because of the folding bed &amp; table.  Chris prefers to be seen in the
Busses &amp; he wants to drive a &quot;slug-bug&quot; (his term for a Beetle) when the
time comes.  Have we done a good job , or what?
