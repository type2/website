Subject: Re: Last Word in Head Gaskets

The last word in head gaskets message is quite true, all manufacturers
have had problems. Some manufacturers have had a head start, however.
Most Japaneese automakers had their trial and error period in the 60's
with iron blocks and aluminum heads, and we had problems with them. We
used to do all kinds of tricks to make them last longer (like coating
them with a wierd gray goop from Subaru). At the same time, US was using
cast iron V8s and VW was air cooled.  

But now most of those problems are over, and with proper care of the
cooling systems head gaskets should never blow. VW's problem seems to be
with corrosion of the head material. It probably doesn't happen that
much in current model cars.

But we with Vanagons are stuck with the older metalurgy. Let's face it,
VW got into the water-cooled arena late.

My grandpa uesd to look at his 49 chevy pickup (expected engine life
60K) and tell me &quot;they just don't build them like the used to&quot;. My
though was &quot;yeah, they build them a lot better now!&quot;
