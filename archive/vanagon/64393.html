&lt;&lt;  As some of you know I work in a repair shop too,  On the Hook came a 94
Eurovan 73K
 on the clock.  Timing belt broke!

   This tells me a couple of things;

   One that if there is an interval to do a service, LISTEN!

   And 2 that the theroy of the newer timing belts being made similar to the
Japanese
 car belts lasting 90 K, I Don't Think So!

   Just want ed to pass on the word about the Mileage.  I've seen Jettas,
Golfs Etc go
 80-90K on a belt.  The weight of the vehicle may have something to do with
the mileage
 too.

   Eurovan Drivers Beware.
  &gt;&gt;

FWIW, my '84 Audi 5000 turbo has 140k mi. (bought it 10 yrs ago at 55k mi)
and I've never had to replace the timing belt. (knock on wood)

uh...same engine as in EV, folks...

now my friend's Jetta GLI 16V...well...that thing EATS timing belts....
(everytime it &quot;eats&quot; one, it gets a real upset stomach, if ya know what I
mean....)
