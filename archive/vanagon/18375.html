Subject: Gas Showers *Are* Dangerous
Date: 26 May 1995 10:50:10 -0700

While people have been joking about the ugliness of gasoline showers,
a piece in this morning's &quot;Santa Barbara News-Press&quot; is a sobering
reminder that these things are dangerous.

A 65-year old man (who apparently lives in a trailer at an RV storage
place) was worried that his fuel line was unsafe and needed replacement.
Got under the van, disconnected fuel line, got showered. Then apparently
touched his wrench to the starter motor and drew a spark.

The local fire chief happened to be driving by with his boat trailer.
Grabbed a fire extinguisher and pulled the unlucky sucker out and
quenched the fire. Managed to keep the fire away from the propane
tanks in the guy's trailer, but as far as I could make out, the van
burned out.

The moral of the story seems to be to disconnect the battery when you
work on the fuel system.
