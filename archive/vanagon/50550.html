Subject: '83.5 gl interior available

Well, I finally have my weekender interior thanks to Chris Turner, so my
'old' interior is now immediately available. Here's the specs:

1983.5 GL (non-weekender)
tan suede (w/multi-brown square design)
front drivers seat in very good condition (just worn, no holes, etc.)
front passenger seat in near excellent condition
middle and rear seats in excellent condition
all side panels in excellent condition
rear compartment and hatch panels not available
no carpet, sorry

It's in the basement and the wife wants it out, so no reasonable offer
refused! I'll be driving to Ringwood, NJ from Cincinnati, Ohio within the
next two weeks if it matters to anyone.
