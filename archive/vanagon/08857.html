Yeah, that 'other room' is usually the bathroom!  I've seen people shaving,
putting on makeup, pluckin' eyebrows, fluffing hair, etc., even while the
car is in motion!  All this is usually done with rear view mirrors pointed
to the driver, leaving no view behind.  Some people really have no problem
attending to personal grooming while driving (in full view of the world,
at that!).  Some people also enjoy reading (that commute to work is *so*
boring!).  I actually saw a person with a newspaper propped up in the
center of the steering wheel, reading it with an occasional glance at the
road, tooling down the hiway!!

Since I'm getting wound up, I also can't figure out people who don't 
bother to scrape ice from their windows in the morning before setting
out.  It's strange to see a car with an 12&quot; square clear area right in
front of the driver, but ice covering all other glass surfaces!  I saw
a person once come up to a stop at the hiway, and this person had to
roll down the window to see out.  Once he determined he could pull out 
(in front of me, of course!), the window went back up, and away he went!  
The windows could just have well been painted over, such was the 
visibility through them.  I personally take the time (that's the key,
I'm sure) to completely scrape all the ice from all the windows and 
mirrors I figure I'm likely to want to use while driving, including
those I would use for backing, parking, emergency manouvers, etc.

&gt; i know: i'm an old fart. :)

Pass the Geritol, would ya sonny?
