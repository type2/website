&gt; Sami is 'smokin';

&gt; The 75 Bus makes a big puff of black smoke (almost?) every time I start
&gt; it. The smoke dissipates after a few seconds and then things seem fine.
&gt; Could it be worn rings? Can I afford to ignore the problem?
&gt; 

  Blackish smoke usually results from a rich mixture &lt;too much gas&gt;. Worn
  rings and/or valve guides cause oil to burn, a bluish-grey colored smoke 
  is the result.

  I would speculate that one of your injectors is leaking gasoline while the
  engine is off, and that the puddle created burns when you first start the
  engine.
