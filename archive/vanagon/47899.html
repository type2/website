&lt;&lt;So a 'loafer, a splitty owner and a vana-goner walk into a bar. The 
'loafer sidles up to the bar and says...&gt;&gt;

...and says...&quot;hey man, like, give me a drink.&quot; 

The splitty owner swaggers up the bar and says &quot;Peace and love, dude, but

The Vanagoner staggers quickly up to the bar and says, breathlessly, 
&quot;Keep the drinks, just give me a couple of gallons for the radiator!&quot;

Oh well...
