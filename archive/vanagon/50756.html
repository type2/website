&gt; Gerry provided the key word, however, and a search on &quot;Yokahama&quot; will

&gt; which, as other listmembers do, offers some well reasoned alternatives

Perhaps if &quot;Yokohama&quot; was spelled correctly, your search would be
better. But why bother when Yokohama Y370 195/75 R14 8 ply rated are THE
ONLY TIRE for your (any) Vanagon.
