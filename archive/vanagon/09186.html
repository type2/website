&gt;yaaaay!.
&gt;34 at last.  What does that mean?

nothing. absolutely nothing. you are a tiny mote in the eye of the universe,
disappearing in a single blink. blink.

on the puny scale of human-to-human interaction in a very restricted locale,
it means:
1. you are now OVER one-third of a Century in age. :)
2. you were born in January, so you are a Capricorn, you old goat. :)
3. you have only 3,143 erections left in your lifetime.  use them wisely.
4. you are nearly middle-aged.
5. no more, no less than you want it to mean. ;)
6. you don't get no Senior Sitizen's Discount anywhere.
7. teen-agers call you &quot;Sir&quot; and it makes you feel strange.
8. college kids call you &quot;Hey, you!&quot; and they think you are old.
9. you cannot be trusted by the Twenties Generation.
10. your insurance company could care less.

&lt;already past middle-age. how many 98 year-old folks do YOU know??&gt;
