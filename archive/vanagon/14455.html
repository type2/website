Heh.  You're sick.  :)

&gt; My questions are about parts availablity--the engine/FI is
&gt; the same as 2L buses, correct?  Are other parts (suspension, etc.)
&gt; reasonably easy to find and not outrageously expensive?  The 
&gt; stories about later vanagon $$ repairs are quite frightening
&gt; to me.

Couple of differences.  The Vanagons (and 79 Breadloaves) have different
shaped exhaust ports on the heads.  Also, the Vanagons don't have a rear
access hatch (although the overhead one inside is larger).  You might
want to check out the article from Road and Track on the Vanagon at:

http://papaya.nosc_dot_mil:80/~schwarze/vw/80bus.html

It's got lots of information on the differences between the Vanagon and
the older model.

&gt; Also, can an average idiot with a voltmeter and some books
&gt; deal with fuel injection?  Stories about FI tend to be those
&gt; of the infuriating/expensive variety but what do people who
&gt; actually have FI think about it?

I don't have it on my bus, but I have it on a Mustang, and I think once
you get familiar with it, it's really not that complicated.
