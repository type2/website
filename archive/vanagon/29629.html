Subject: search for alloy wheels

I'm in search for alloy wheels for my '71 Westy. She's under a resto. and
ready for the body shop. I'm looking for a style like the American Racing
Equip. series# 61 or 162 that will fit the stock bolt pattern. The local
companies claim nothing can be found. I have seen them over the years.

I'm new to the group, and it's great. Any help will be appreciated!
