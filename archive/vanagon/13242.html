Subject: '74 Van Forsale in Sacramento
Date: Wed, 15 Mar 1995 08:00:03 -0800 (PST)

I checked out a '74 pop-top camper van (Westfalia) at
a Bel Air market last night in Rancho Cordova.  It had
faded blue paint.  I really couldn't get a good look at
the interior but it looked like all the camping bits were
there.  Minor body dings here and there.  Engine compart-
ment looked okay.  All the smog stuff was there.  Dual
Solex carbs.  Owners sign said:

  $1,800  OBO  1974 Camper Van
  4 Speed, Rebuilt Engine
  Runs well, well maintained
