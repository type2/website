Subject: Reply to: brake question

Your brake pedal sinking sounds like a master cylinder problem to me, or possibly even a problem with the vacuum brake booster.  I'm not sure how to diagnose tho.  I'm sure you will get a more complete answer from someone else.  Why it affects the parking brake?  Well I can only say 'cause it's a Volkswagen ;)
