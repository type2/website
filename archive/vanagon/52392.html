Subject: 91 runs rough cold

Greetings - 
  A friend called this evening from Connecticut re: his 91 vanagon 
running very rough while it's cold. It starts right up and then for the 
next fifteen minutes or so  - before it reaches operating temp. - it runs 
really rough - accelerating with no load, or while driving it surges. He 
describes it as if it's running rich - but there's no black smoke. The 
problem is getting worse and the ambient temperature is in the 30's. He's 
read the resistance of the temp sensor and says it correct at cold temp. 
It seems to run normally when fully warmed up. Any ideas as to what might be 
causing this?
  Perhaps related - he wonders about the procedure for timing it with a 
timing light -  (Apparently the book listed procedure for the digifant 
engine is not very clear or doesn't involve a light).
                Thanks in advance.
                      Eric
