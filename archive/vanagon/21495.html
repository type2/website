World Trade Organization (Formerly General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
-GATT).

Speaking of irrelevant info. Has anyone noticed that the swivel seats on
the Vanagon Westfalias are mounted above the standard sliders, giving an
extra 1&quot; in height to the seat?


Today I removed the front bumper to mount the front plate. Question - the
licence plate was originally bolted to the front of the car just below the
grille. Is the standard location on the bumper (no provision for mounting)
or on the body as it was? I am using strapping to hold the plate in place
instead of drilling into that nice chrome finish.
