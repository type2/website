&gt; Why not do something in insulated stainless steel, sort of
like the one
&gt; from the Vanagon catalog?  Seems more 'keepable' than plastic.
&gt; 

My experience with a insulated stainless steel mug was that it
sucked all the heat out of the coffee.  Sure you could
&quot;pre-heat&quot; with hot water, but this makes things complicated.  I
vote for good old cheap insulated plastic.  

The Aladdin Company of Nashville, TN. has a good insulated
plastic mug you might consider.
