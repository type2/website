&gt; All these heat threads have got me thinking about winter camping.  I seem 
&gt; to remember that someone suggested installing a propane furnace, like the 
&gt; ones that the new winnebago Eurovan campers use.  Has anyone tried this.  
&gt; Where would you mount it?  I'm thinking the bottom of the Westy closet in 
&gt; an '84 vanagon camper.  What about next to the water tank?  

How about behind the passenger seat, a-la Dave Garth?  There are pix of
his installation at http://www.teleport_dot_com/~des/vw/garth

&gt; My Camping world catalog list a furnace made by Suburban that is vented 
&gt; outside with the same vent that is used on the Eurovan camper.  
&gt; 
&gt; 12,000 BUT furnace
&gt; 12 V 2.8 Amps
&gt; 9 3/8&quot; by 9 3/8&quot; by 21 1/8&quot;
&gt; $349

&gt;From the dimensions I assume this is one of the ones that will require
you to cut a 9-3/8 x 9-3/8 hole in the side of the camper, and mount it
extending inward.  I hope I'm wrong...
 
&gt; I'm also concerned about the propane and 12 volt use from running this 
&gt; thing overnight.  I would like to have some propane left over for hot 
&gt; coffee.  Does anybody know how much propane the Westy tank holds?  

I don't think it is more than 3 gallons.  My similarly sized tank can
run my big honking propane heater for 2-3 nights, depending on how high
it is turned up.  Sure wish I had a bigger tank.  2.8 amps also sounds 
kinda high - I wouldn't want to have that load running all night every
night.

&gt; Also, is 12,000 BTUs going to keep the van warm on a cold night?  

I think 12,000 BTU's is quite a bit for a VW camper.  This heater sounds
to me like a model intended for a big RV.  Bigger than a VW, at least...
