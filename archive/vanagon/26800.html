Ed, sorry to hear about this sad news.  Try alcohol....not the stuff 
you drink, but isoprypol alcohol.  It should remove that stuff pretty 
easily.

Hope this helps.
Harry.

&gt; I went to watch the home comming game at my old highschool friday 
&gt; night and when I returned, I found written in perminant black marker 
&gt; on my white paint, a large anarchy symbol extending from my drivers 
&gt; window almost to the wheel well.  Some one must have taken offense of 
&gt; my peace symbols.  I spent quite a while with liquid soft scrub 
&gt; clenser trying to remove it, ending up with a much less prominent but 
&gt; still very agrivating light blue anarchy symbol.  Can anyone think of 
&gt; a good way to remove the ink with out harming the paint underneeth?
&gt; Thanks.
&gt; Ed.
