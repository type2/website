Subject: RE: Anyone have a Eurovan Diesel?

&gt; &gt; I'm considering the diesel over the gas version, mainly because of its 
fuel
&gt; &gt; economy (I realize air isn't available in the diesels).  How reliable is 
the
&gt;
&gt; Interesting.   I'd say, for the Vanagon westy, (My cousin has an '87 gas 
and
&gt; I have the '81 diesel), You're definitely better off with the gas.  The
&gt; gas one gets about the same miles/gallon if you drive it gently.  The 
Diesel
&gt; Westy is said to get 28 mpg, but I never got better than 23-24 --  with 
the
&gt; diesel, your foot tends to floor the accelerator at all times.

Hmmm.  The specs I have for the '95 Eurovan Camper are:
2.5L 5-cyl Gas:    14.4L/100km (20mpg) city   11.4L/100km (25 mpg) hwy
2.4L 5-cyl Diesel:  9.2L/100km (31mpg) city    8.2L/100km (34 mpg) hwy

According to these, the diesel does much better in this respect, but who 
knows what kind of numbers real-world (my) tests would produce.  That said, 
I *have* found that my '92 Jetta Turbo Diesel's fuel economy is pretty much 
in line with Transport Canada's numbers.

Still haven't test-driven one of these, since they are really hard to find. 
 Neither of the two dealers in Kitchener/Waterloo have one so I'll probably 
have to go to Toronto to find one to test.  If I do go for the diesel, I 
wonder what kind of self-inflicted parts hell (availability, cost) I'll be 
subjecting myself to in 10 years time.  Is the Vanagon diesel engine unique 
to the Vanagon, just as the Eurovan diesel is? If so, have you had trouble 
finding parts at reasonable prices?  What about competent service (or do you 
do it yourself)?
