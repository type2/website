Subject: Barndoor Rear Hatch (was VW Bus Web Page Update)


Here's some Barndoor Rear Hatch trivia for you:

Part #         Description                        Type and Model

211 829 031    Rear panel lid without window      211-238
                 up to chassis No. 20-117 901

221 829 031    Rear panel lid with window         211-238
                 up to chassis No. 20-117 901

271 829 031    Rear panel lid                     271-274
                 up to chassis No. 20-117 901

So there were not rear hatches &quot;officially&quot; available for barndoor 
deluxes, only panels, microbuses, kombis, and ambulances.

&gt;        I made some minor cosmetic changes to my web pages, and added a
&gt;pixture of Marc Heine's 195? panel, complete with rear hatch.  I though
&gt;those things were rare, but this is now the 3rd bus I've seen with one!
