Subject: car survey (fwd)

Could some of the vanagon people post their responses on the list?
I'm sure more humorous responses could be found...

Warning: If you mind taking a 5 minute survey, stop reading this post now!

I am doing a small survey for a statistics course and would like to get 
some general information from fellow netters on thier cars to use
in a project.  Please take a minute to fill in the appropriate answers
and email the reply to me at survey_at_sun-ra.rsip.lsu_dot_edu.  Thank you.
