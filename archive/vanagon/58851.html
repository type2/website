&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; Recently there was a post about making sure the ecu was grounded. I went
&gt; and looked at the ecu on my 83 WB and it appears that the ecu is more like
&gt; insulated from the body. There is that plastic housing attached to the
&gt; frame. There doesn't appear to be any were to ground it (wires?) Does
&gt; anyone know anything about this. Also, is it true that upper control arm
&gt; bushings are dealer only? Has anyone changed them? Thanks.

&gt;   A student is not a vessel to be filled, but rather a torch to be set
&gt; alight.Dave,
	My experience is ..some time ago I had a problem with the westie 
near stalling when i turned sharp right hand corners and some times it 
falterd when going over large bumps...had me flumuxed for a while then I 
removed a small diecast box heater that i kept stored between the rear 
heater and the ECU the problem went away never to return(Theory...The 
metal heater was grounding the ECU???)
s'all I got
