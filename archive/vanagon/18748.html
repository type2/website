Subject: GNATT/Lassen Park


Anyone going to Lassen Park to meet up with Dave Schwarze (+ anyone else
who's already on GNATT) when they come into California?  I'd like to
go up and join them at Lassen Park (1 hour or so east of Redding) on
Wednesday, June 14th, and stay with the tour probably through Friday,
June 16th, returning to the Bay Area Friday evening, at which time I
believe they will be in Yosemite.  I think Bradley Prunehead will
also attend.  Anyone else from the Bay Area (or elsewhere for that
matter) interested?
