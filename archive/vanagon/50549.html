Subject: new email address (no vw content)
Date: Wed, 16 Oct 1996 23:06:16 -0400

To all who care,

My new email address is:

tony_at_moorelab_dot_com

If you really care, you can see what I do for a &quot;living&quot; at:

http://moorelab_dot_com

If you just have the insatiable need to type 'www', you'll still get there.

My old email address, moorelab_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com, will be active until the end
of October. I'm trying to get Netcom to forward any email sent to the old
address, but they don't seem to like the idea. Also, I have 20meg's of
space on my new corporate account, which I can't even come close to
filling. So if anyone has any useful vw stuff they would like on the web,
I'll put it up for nuthin!

Thanks for the time,

tony
