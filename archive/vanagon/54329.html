Hi Tim: I'll let you and the list know how the &quot;brewing&quot; goes. One thing
about trying it on a off road racer is that in one day you will have
some idea of how it is going to work. I have destroyed  as many as 2 of
the 4 Porsche 930 (They are the same as VW bus only a lot bigger) CVs in
one 400 milerace. Off road is really tough on them. If the grease works
I should be able to tell after a couple of races. As for the motor oil,
I have always used dino oil but I am liste
ning. I like the idea of a  high quality bypass filter with synthetic
and I am looking real hard at adding Prolong. I have a couple of old VW
aircooled engines here. I may take one and put Prolong in it, drive it
for awhile and then drain the oil out and see how long it will go. I
have some trouble beliving the thing on TV where Al Unser (I think it's
Al) drives the new Viper around a track along with a bunch of other cars
that have all drained their oil. For one thing, if there is no oil what
happens to the Hydraulic lifters. On TV the cars don't sound bad. I
would think they would clatter like crazy.
