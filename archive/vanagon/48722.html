A while back, I was doing some engine searching myself and I recall VW having
a core charge policy such that if the core was damaged internally from engine
failure, they would still refund the core charge.  The only time they would
deny the core charge refund was from external damage such as a fire or
collision.  Of course VW charges about $2,400 for their longblock, but it
might be worth checking out.  I recall hearing this core &quot;policy&quot; at a VW
dealer.  I did not see it in writing and I did not hear it directly form a VW
representative - so if you pursue this, check it out carefully.

Good luck,
