Subject: Re: 87 Synchro CV Boots


&gt; I just bought and '87 Synchro, and an outboard front CV boot let go the 
&gt; first day (did I turn a corner too tight?). I plan on pulling all the 
&gt; axles and repacking the joints.  What's the best CV boot available, and 
&gt; where can I get them?  Is there a split boot available (for a temporary 
&gt; measure)?
&gt; 
I just bought a full set of these, altogether about $100 for the four.
Can't help you out about where to shop back east -- I got mine at the
&quot;Friendly Local Auto Parts Store&quot; in San Jose california.

The reason I'm doing a post back to the whole net was that I was surprised
that the outer boots are not &quot;german rubber&quot; but are some white relatively
stiff plastic (probably urethane).  I looked under my Syncro and discovered
the original ones are the same.  I guess that even VW didn't think real
highly of rubber boots on this more highly stressed area, and chose a different
material.  Maybe there's a lesson there for all the controversy over the
&quot;genuine&quot; german rubber boots over the aftermarket jobs.  All four of the
boots I got are &quot;Lobro&quot; brand (there's two dots over the first o) from
germany.  The inner boot comes complete with all new bolts, clamps, etc.,
while the outer has a new big nut for the axel.  Both come with pre-measured
grease.  Real nice.  Can't say how they fit yet, as I still haven't put 'em
in, but they look nice.

The local VW dealer wanted $100 each for these, by the way -- the auto parts
store could not believe the $25 price -- they were more used to $5-$10.

I was thrilled with paying them $100 for four instead of for one.  Others
out there may have better deals yet -- I did not shop around really.
