Subject: Parts ordering experience

A leaking rear heater core has caused me to investigate parts sources other
than local Atlanta dealers and local FLAPS.  I assumed that the rear heater
valve was the culprit and ordered a new one from Camelback VW in
Phoenix--total cost $61, outrageous, but better than the $75 that Jim Ellis
here in Atlanta quoted me.  The part arrived in about a week.

After getting the heater removed, I realized that the valve was holding up
well, but the core was leaking. I didn't mind so much ordering the new valve
even though it wasn't leaking because the old valve was still broken--no way
to shut off the flow.  I called Camelback and order a core for $119,
suggested price was $157.  I have been waiting for this part for 10 days
now, finally calling yesterday to find out where it was.  They never ordered
it!  I suggest calling them back after three days to check up on
progress--now it will be another week before I get my part!  Another week of
drivng with no rear interior bits installed in my van (I took almost
everything out to clean the coolant leak from the carpet and cork sound
insulation).  It's LOUD!  On the good side, I now get a consistent 21MPG
without the weight of all those parts back there.

I tried to expedite the new part by calling Ellis VW here to match the
price, they told me that $119 was below their cost.  Is Camelback getting a
discount that the &quot;Largest VW Dealer in North America&quot; can't get? (Yeah, right).

Camelback does have a toll-free number, BTW, it's 800-876-5199.  Use it,
they'll keep you on hold forever.

I also ordered a new bumber from Volks Motor Sports for $135 and some new
end caps for both front and rear bumpers.  Total with shipping to Atlanta
was just shy of $200.  While the chrome job on the bumper is not perfect and
the holes will have to be drilled for the impact strip before I install, I
am very happy with this purchase.  New bumpers cost $395 from the dealer.
Looking forward to having a pristine rear bumper on my van.
