 someone that lives there rather than one that doesn't.  Do the rest of you
that
 live in the LA basin agree with Jim on this? &gt;&gt;

Having lived in the LA Basin for more than 30 years, smog was one of the top
5 reasons for my relocating to Redding, Northern Calif., 3 years ago.  It's
nice to get up in the morning and not have to chew the atmosphere, even if it
has been in the triple digits for more than two weeks. ;)

On occasion, I do have to go to LA on business and everytime I drop into the
San Fernando Valley I can't wait to turn around and go HOME.
