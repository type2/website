Subject: 	Anyone want a '59 bug?


I found a '59 bug today.  Its straight, no rust that I could find
(I didn't get to look under rear seat)  all fenders and aprons are
perfectly straight, has all lights (front and rear) headliner, interior,
bumpers, etc.  All there, w/40hp motor (not running)  A weekend with
a garden hose and a vacuum cleaner would make this a very nice car.
(oh, and get the motor running)

He wants $900 or so.

Benji: (209) 748-5411

The bug is south of Sacramento, in Galt, California
