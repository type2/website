Jim,

If you have the January '94 issue of EUROPEAN CAR look
on page 100.  It shows a picture of two gauges mounted on
a VDO flexible mount below the heater controls against the
steering column cover on a 1984 Crew Cab Transporter.

If you don't have access to this issue just e-mail me with your
mailing address and I'll send you a copy of this article.  The
article is actual about a transporter with a 3.0 liter 911 Porsche
engine.

If I were to put additional gauges in my 87 Syncro I'd seriously
consider mounting them in this location using the same type of
VDO mount.  I have used this mount before in a Rabbit Pickup
and even placed it in the same relative position.  These VDO
mounts are made of some type of flexible rubber.
