It was to hot and dry, and a bit over crowded for most of us.  So we packed
up the fire wood, and other crap, hooked up CBs, and took off.  We had a
nice caravan of 5 buses, and chatted away during the drive to cooler
climes.  We wound up in the Sequoia National Forest and found a free camp
site that had lots of room, and a creek running right next to it.  There
were a few other people camping near us, and they came over and spent the
night with us around the camp fire. 

Thanks to: Ron Lussier, and his guest Jordan,
Joe, Laura and Joshua Chanin
Steve and Linda Johnson,
Jack Stafford who gave my sister Ann a ride,
and Martha
