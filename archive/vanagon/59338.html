&gt; &lt;&lt; Also, I find the fact that the windows (power) only work with the ignition

&gt;  annoying - this may just be because I can't seem to find an accessory

&gt;  on the ignition switch. &gt;&gt;

You'll find accessory positions on the fuse/relay panel: spare spade
connectors on one side for pre-ignition switch use; spare spades on the
other side for post-ignition switch use.
