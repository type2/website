Subject:       Free to Good Home: Westy Tent Pages

Now that I have your attention...:)

Well, my ISP finally woke up and decided to enforce their 1MB limit 
on web pages.  To keep them from going in and deleting stuff 
willy-nilly, I've had to remove all the fullsize jpegs linked to the 
thumbnails on the pages.  So don't yell if you get a &quot;404 Not Found&quot; 
error.

I'm working on a solution that involves a new ISP (moving from 
$35/month and 1MB to $13/month and 2MB!) but that really doesn't 
solve the problem.  I have more images from Michael Heron and others
that I'd like to put up, so I need a place.  And my current ISP charges
$6/month/MB over 1meg -- which I can't quite rationalize away.  I also
want to start doing some volunteer pages around the community, and until that 
starts earning bread I need headroom.

I'd like to explore the possibility of distributing the pages to 
various sites -- one kind of tent here, another kind there -- to 
reduce the byte bite.  If anyone has a couple hundred MB to spare on 
their WWW directory and is interested in hosting one or more of the 
pages, let me know.  I'd email or ftp the pages and images to you 
after modifying the appropriate links; everything would still be 
accessible from a central site but e.g. the foyer tent might be at 
site A, the privy tent at site B, etc.  You don't have to know beans 
about html as long as your ISP gives you space to keep web pages in.


&lt;sigh&gt;  How bout you guys at www.vwus_dot_com opening up a couple meg for 
a needy VW enthusiast?

In the meantime if you have a desperate, aching need for one of 
the fullsize jpegs let me know.
