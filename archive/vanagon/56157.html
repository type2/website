Subject: Re: Parts Place and neat tools

&gt;      Most of their cool tools can be purchased direct from thier 
&gt; supplier, SP Tools of Anaheim Hills.  Their catalog is a must for any 
&gt; mechanical type who works on any type of car.  Their number is 

Sure the wheel bearing puller is available for some $250+, or the $20 
rental, personally I use a press either way and don't care.  I stand 
by my rec on them, maybe 30 orders in 10 years, maybe 4 returns, big 
savings on things like Quantum Syncro exhaust, NO ONE else but VW 
would even touch that one and saved 50% of dealer cost, used Vanagon P/S 
pump at excellent cost years ago when they were real rare.  I've 
never paid for shipping on a return and have always been eventually 
satisfied with my service, though admittedly the frustration of 
recieving a wrong part sometimes seems unbearable.  As for pricing, 
they say up front that they change all the time, I too have an 
excellent local source for most things, I use the PP catalog as a 
start and look for better prices elsewhere but would order anything 
from them again in a second.  I've ordered stuff for some pretty 
bizarre cars from them BTW with little problem, Q syncro, Corrado, 
'77 Audi Fox, etc.  Again plastic is your best protection.
