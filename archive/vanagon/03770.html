&gt;     Has anyone ever seen/owned a Brazilian Bus. The Delux Microsbus 
&gt;     split-screen body with the bubble front window and doors.

I'm confused how can it have both a split-screen body and a bay-window? 
Do you mean it has small square windows on the sides?

In the VW transporter book, there is a picture of a 21 window with a
sliding door.  Just think what that thing would be worth today!

BTW - yesterday I saw the ULTIMATE bus.  It wasn't in the most restored
shape, but it had all the basics:  it was a '51 (!!!!), 23-window,
sunroof, semaphores, barn-door (of course), and lacking the ventilation
system.  And the dash was the early, first version of the full dash, which
looks like something out of a bug crossed with a bus!
