&gt; This is for Martha and other females on the net (and
&gt; for any males who might be interested): 
&gt; 
     I myself, being male, sewed new (and very nice-looking, I might add)
curtains for my Kombi/camper. I have been sewing ever since Home
Economics class in 7th grade.
     I also do All the cooking on trips, as well as most of the cleaning. My
girlfriend doesn't show much interest in that sort of thing. I use a
single-burner Coleman white gasoline stove. It works great. On my longer
road trips, I usually cook breakfast, have something cold for lunch, and
then cook dinner. 
     Also on the interior, I re-paneled with 3/16&quot; wood paneling, like
lots of houses had in the den. I also made a cabinet for the side door,
and custom built armrests for the front doors...
anyway
