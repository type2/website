Subject:      No idle when cold

My 91 carat has developed a problem that it woll not idle when cold...I
have to warm it up for
a few minutes or it will stall.  Once warm it idles ok...but I sometimes
feel a surge while driving...
I replaced plugs cap and rotor...even wires.... I checked the air box
clamp and it seams tighe...
could the air box be bad? How would I check it....

Thanks in advance

John
