Subject: importing vw stuff from lebanon?

       so does it do us any good to know there are parts of the world where
vanagons are both plentiful...and cheap to buy and maintain?  this is my
question.....
      i have heard that in lebanon for instance...the above is true.  has
anyone pursued the viability...legality...of bringing parts in from places
where their cheap?   how about used parts?   used vanagons...?  seems like
theres a business opportunity here...just dont know the pitfalls.  if
 anybody  has thought about these possabilities,,id love to hear what uve
learned or concluded.   does the reference ive read on the list to south
africa ,ive read on the list, fall under this interest?
