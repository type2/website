I saw Dave Schwarze blow out a 60 Amp ammeter, and I doubt it was blown out
by 30 Amps.

&gt;  The wires from the alternator to the original battery are a pair of #12's.
&gt;  I've never seen them fry although they do get quite warm with a lot of
&gt; accesories, lights, etc being used.

I'd try to use at least 4 gauge to wire in more batteries.  A pair of 12 is
the same as a single 8 gauge, and if it's warming up... then it's to small.
