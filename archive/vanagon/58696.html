Subject: Oettinger Fog Lamps

Greetings Volks,

I was checking out the 16&quot; Synco pics on the Synco Page and was
eyeing the Oettinger Fog Lamps.  I spoke with Derek Drew, who
ordered some, and he says that someone else had also ordered
them.  I'd be interested in any help or tips one get one of
these as I'd like to beef up my lighting without drilling holes 
in my bumper.

Thanks in advance,
