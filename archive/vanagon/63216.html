Blake:

I used about 21 ft of 7mm (fuel Injection, high pressure) hose on my
87.
Yes! replace the &quot;Y&quot; fittings as well as the $2 grommets (above tank,
fuel filler, and filler breather)...  Plan for this adventure, it can
take
a week to get the parts.  I choose to lower the tank... I wanted to
replace
upper/lower Rad. and heater hoses too.  If you take this route, empty
the
tank first.. It can be pretty heavy, even with a couple of gallons in
there.

Also a good time to check the front heater valve, Rad. and Spare!

&gt; I am getting ready to replace most of my fuel line.  I spent yesterday
&gt; trying to figure out the right size to buy and find a place to buy it.
&gt;
&gt; Questions for those who are in the know:
&gt;
&gt; 1 - the archives say to buy 8mm(5/16&quot;) hose.
&gt; I know my fuel filter takes 7mm hose.
&gt; How much of each?
&gt;
&gt; 2 - I also need to replace one of the Y fittings on top of my tank.
&gt; I am thinking about replacing all the hose up there too while i'm at it.
&gt; Is this a good idea?
&gt; Do I need clamps for this hose?
&gt; What size hose do I use for this?
&gt;
&gt; 3 - am I in for hell while doing this??
&gt;
&gt; Thanks as usual
