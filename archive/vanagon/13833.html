&gt; On my daily commute, I drive a two-lane rural road that has traffic that 
&gt; moves very fast.  Sometimes a combination of strong winds and large trucks 
&gt; going 65-70mph will cause the front of my Westy pop-top to pop up about 1.5 
&gt; inches and stay there.  There are some little clips in the very front that I 
&gt; think are supposed to keep this from happening, but they aren't doing their 
&gt; job and I don't think they are adjustable.  For the time being (to keep from 
&gt; permanent damage to the top hinges) I have a BIC ski hold down strap keeping 
&gt; the front down.
&gt; 
&gt; Questions:  Anybody else ever have this happen?  Are there any adjustments 
&gt; in the top mechanism that would fix this?  Are these little hold down clips 
&gt; (they are shaped like question marks (?)) unique to the '73 or did they use 
&gt; the same thing on all Westy's?

Ahem.....yes, I can relate to this!  Some months ago, I was having my Westy
transported to my new home in AZ.  It was sitting on top of one of those
big auto transporters, and the wind caught the front as you described, and
popped it up, as you described.  Only problem was that now the combined
height of the truck was just slightly higher than the next overpass, so
the truck and my Bus made it through, but the poptop, roof rack, and top
fold up cot did not.  Incidently, the extra stuff that didn't make it 
through ended up landing on a Honda that was following the truck.  So
somewhere out there is the worlds only Honda Westfalia conversion!

As you might imagine, I too am very interested in a wind-proof method
of securing the front hinge point!
