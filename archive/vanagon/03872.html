&gt;My wife's sister married her first cousin, and that wasn't down south at
&gt;all, so I guess I'll have to defend the right to be from a place and not
&gt;have ridiculous stereotypes applied.  On the other hand, what does this
&gt;have to do with bricks?  ...

well ... in a way, driving a bus/brick IS kinda of a ridiculous stereotype.
actually, the bus/brick itself is a ricidulous stereotype. anything useful,
functional, un-adorned with style and fashion and vinyl wood-grain panels
on the sides is somewhat ridiculous these days. (my humble apologies to
anyone who has put those wood-grain panels on the sides of their bus! :)

and sometimes, just sometimes, like when you have to buy a part from a
dealer, you sort of feel like maybe you did marry your cousin/sister/pig. ;)
you get that kinda oh-what-have-i-done-i-maybe-ought-not-have-done-this
feeling, sort of a low dull uncomfortable feeling way down in your gut.

&gt;...                         Or, now that we all know what it costs to
&gt;maintain one, the rich VW driver.

there are rich people that drive vw's???

&gt;On third thought, maybe someone could come up with a riddle or a song or
&gt;something ...

not another song!?? :)

unca joel
who did NOT marry his cousin (althought he has a couple that are FINE!!!)
and who obviously has too much time on his hands today. :)
