..did my alternator leave its useful life.

I changed the voltage regulator last night. No go. Then I checked for 
shorts, found none.

I didn't have an ammeter, but I figured it had to be the alternator. So I 
put a new one in (149.95 with core trade-in at Pep Boys, the local FLAPS, 
guaranteed for the life of the car), and voila! It works.

This weekend I'll change all the belts. I've been meaning to do that 
anyway.

PS-a non-Vanagon (but still VW) question: if a Jetta at idle creeps up to 
2000rpm, drops to 800, and creeps up again, over and over (sometimes 
stays at 1800rpm), what would you look for as a cause? dirty fuel 
injectors?

&quot;Hey, I'll try anything once. Twice if it's not too painful&quot;
