&gt; Those of you interested in diesels may want to phone Scott Foss

&gt; and he said it was the first time he'd ever received a call from
&gt; a female.  He does I believe servicing and replacing of diesels,

First call from a woman?  That sounds like on VW mechanic that needs to get 
out more often.
