Subject: Oettinger &amp; 2.5 litre Vanagon Motors

Tom, 

Before talking about Oettinger, did you see that post from Brian in the
Netherlands? He had a company called Bernard Ahnendorp Sport selling high
quality parts right now to convert 2.1 litre motors to 2.5. This may be a
better way to go if Oettinger is indeed on the way out.

write to verbeek_at_the-hague.stbv.slb_dot_com (Brian Verbeek) or dig up his old post

&quot;Re: Ben Pon and Dereks Big Mot&quot;

in the archives. 

Or contact the company directly,

&gt;     Derek,
&gt;
&gt;     I can't find an address or fax# for Oettinger. I want to explore
&gt;     the 2.5 thing a little more. I went through the archives, seems
&gt;     there was momentum on this for awhile, but much of the world is
&gt;     sinewaves...

Well, I dropped the ball on it. I have a phone number for Oettinger in NY
somewhere. Remind me in about a week and I'll dig the number out. Oettinger
answers the phone and the people there are pleasant to deal with but I am
told Oettinger is down from a huge organization to a handful of individuals
sitting around in a warehouse taking orders for old stock. 

&gt;     If they don't want to sell in the US, I was thinking about the guy
&gt;     going over in January. One ad in the back of EC has a local vendor
&gt;     mentioning Oettinger, but when I called him it seems he is only at the
&gt;     stage of ordering their catalogue.

When I wrote to them for some fogg lamp parts they sent them to my home in
NYC no questions asked and no duty or taxes charged either. I think if you
don't make a big deal out of this they might ship the motor parts here. Or
we could get a european list fanatic to forward the stuff.

&gt;     Do you have data on the 2.5? Is it just cylinders and pistons,
&gt;     or did they do the crankshaft? Any specs?

No. Dunno.

&gt;     Syncro #2 arrives tonite or tomorrow am.


Perhaps I could reproduce some Oettinger letters off my hard drive. :

Dear Sirs,

In July of 1990 I ordered and installed a set of Oettinger fog lamps,
Ordernumber: OE 631 009 00, for my Volkswagen Type II Caravelle Syncro
Transporter Westfalia Joker.  I received these here in New York City and
installed them. But a few months later my vehicle hit a deer that was
walking in the road and the Volkswagen was destroyed. Unfortunately, the
plastic pieces (OE 631 012 00) that cover the turn signal lenz were broken
in the accident.

In 1990 I bought another Syncro Westfalia Caravelle Camper and I wrote to
you at that time asking to buy 1) 3 additional sets of plastic grill pieces
(OE 631 012 00)--the ones that go over the turn signal lenz, and 2) a second
set of fogg lamps for my friend. You wrote back to me within a couple of
months saying that you were sorry for the delay but you were returning the 3
additional sets of plastic grill pieces to the manufacturer because of poor
quality and that there would be a delay. A few months later you sent me the
OE 631 009 00 but not the 3 additional sets of plastic grill pieces. 

Please quote me a price to buy additional sets (left + right) of OE 641 012
00 plastic pieces to cover the turn signal lenz and fogg lamps. You may
respond to this letter by voice or fax to me here in New York at
212-580-4459. Or you may use postal mail to the address above or electronic
mail to me on INTERNET at derekdrew_at_aol_dot_com. 
I still have an extra set of Oettinger fogg lamps but cannot use them
without these spare parts.

	Thank you,

Thank you for responding to my letter. Can you please send me two pairs of
these fogg lamp plastic grill pieces (OE 631 012 00 x 2 + OE 631 011 00 x 2
= DM182.62) to my address here in New York via your normal government post
office system. I want you to send these to me by ship and not by air because
by air it is too expensive.

I would like to pay by credit card. I have an American Express card
xxxxxxxxxxx (expires April 1997) or a Visa card xxxxxxxxxxxx (expires July
1995) or a MasterCard xxxxxxxxxxxxxx (expires July 1995).

If you have questions/problems my voice and fax number is 212-580-4459.

				Thank you, 



				Derek Drew

After this they called by telephone and told me to send a check as they no
longer accepted credit cards.
