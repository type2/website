Subject: Warm buses

 My uncle, a VW/snowmobile {!} mechanic shared his setup with me. He 
likes to camp in Montana in the winter, so he obtained the smallest 
propane furnace meant for a motorhome. Cut carved and plumbed it into the 
divider between the driver's seat. Intake and output were sent outside 
the bus. Themostatic heat! Claims it makes snow camping comfortable..If 
anyone wants more details, I'll contact him. Might be a little overkill 
for CA, but on the right night........
