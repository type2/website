Subject: oil mist in engine compartment.  HELP.

i have a 40hp motor that i will put back in my crew cab when it is done.  
the problem is that it tends to mist oil all over the campartment.  i 
realy do not want my new paint job all oily so i turn to you guys for ideas.
i rebuilt the motor about one year ago.  had it align bored and put in 
new bearings and rings.  i also put is a big bore 40hp kit.  the motor is 
all stock from there on.  carb, dist,etc are all original.  the heads are 
&quot;bastard&quot; type 40hp heads.  any idea as to why the motor mist's oil.  it 
apears to be comming out fron the nose of the motor right behind the 
pully.  it is definatly not comming from the oil cooler.  most of it 
concentrates around the front (rear of car) of the motor.  any help or 
advice would be greatly apreciated.
take care and God BLess
matt
