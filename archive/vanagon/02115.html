Subject: solenoid

WHen I went to school for my FCC license, the instructor told us, with a
completely straight face, that the third step in troubleshooting was &quot;to slap
the unit on all sides and on the top with the palm of your hand&quot;.  I can usually
get an extra 5 or 10 megahertz out of my 486 with this trick.
