&gt;I'm for the split.

&gt;Water-cooled's are orphans, not even supported by VW any longer, save 
&gt;in the peripheral sense.  Valient efforts by a few to keep them alive
thru 
&gt;engine transplants generally get short shrift from their peers.  
&gt;
&gt;Over the last couple of years of Vanagon list activity I've gained a 
&gt;strong impression that the typical owner of a water-cooled VW van is not
only 
&gt;less mechanically adept than air-cooled owners, they seen less willing
to 
&gt;acquire the skills and invest in the tools that would keep their
orphaned 
&gt;vehicles alive, a failure of spirit -- or Fear of Grease -- that
virtually 
&gt;assures such machines will end up on the junk heap.

The last person I would think of on this list to malign another Type II
owner was Bob Hoover.  I always thought that Bob and his sermons were
some of the high points of the list with information that could be of
use to just about all list members.  I am trying not to take his last
paragraph personally, especially since he did not single anyone out, but
with such a shot-gun blast, its hard not to.  I am really sorry that Bob
has such a dislike for we who have water-cooleds.  This is all I have to
say, perhaps I have said too much.

P.S.
I have done ALL the work on both of these, plus two Rabbits, '69 Impala,
'72 Lemans, etc.
