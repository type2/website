&gt; behold, when I removed the brake line from the caliper, expecting fluid
&gt; to pour out, none did.  I then removed the hose and tried to blow
&gt; through it and could not.  After I replaced the right caliper and hose,
&gt; the bus pulled to the *right*.  I figured that the left hose was also
&gt; plugged.  Finally got around to replacing the left hose/caliper last
&gt; weekend, and sure enough that hose was plugged too.  Now the bus doesn't
&gt; pull any more, and the brakes don't drag.  I suggested to Darie that he

David speaks sage advice.  My poor braking in the Pioneer was caused 
by both rear hoses being plugged (the hoses were rotten and cracked 
and swollen).  Since the fronts were doing all the work they became 
glazed and braking performance would go to about 0, on a downhill 
stop.

Checking/Replacing the hoses would be my first advice too.
