Proper Tire Inflation for Even Wear

Equipment needed: One piece of chalk

1&gt;Draw a line across the treads of each tire.
2&gt;Drive a few feet.
3&gt;Look at line.
4&gt;If line is worn in the middle,let out some air then goto step one.
5&gt;If line is worn on edges, add air then goto step one.
6&gt;If line is worn evenly your are done!
Good Luck
Ken Lewis
