Subject: RE: 95 EV: Adapter for CellPhone

Megan asks:

&gt;My cellphone adapter( for the lighter), which worked fine in my Chev =
&gt;Blazer,
&gt;does not sit tightly in my EV's lighter receptacle (which seems to be =
&gt;shorter in
&gt;length). Are there special adapters used in VW's? Do I need to get a =
&gt;whole new
&gt;adapter, or is there a supplement to the one I already have that will =
make &gt;it
&gt;sit properly in the receptacle?


Believe it or not, cigarette lighters come in two sizes SAE (US size), =
and DIN (European size). The SAE size (on your power cord) is slightly =
smaller than the DIN size (the lighter socket on your EV).

There are two solutions. The first is to gently bend the ground tab on =
your power cord just enough so that it makes contact in the socket. The =
other is to mount a second lighter socket of the proper diameter.

I'm going to do the second soon. I found that the little cubby hole to =
the right of the steering wheel makes a nice holder for my flip-phone, =
so I'm going to put a second socket in that cubby.
