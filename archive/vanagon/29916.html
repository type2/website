Subject: '79 f.i./carb coversion (finally)

Well, after 9 weeks at my local vw mechanic my '79 Cal bus is going to be
fixed. The mechanic says they're giving up on the brain-fix and are going to
remove all the computer-ignition stuff and install a center-mount Weber
carb. It is claimed this will get me more power and be easier to repair in
the future.  The cost of a new &quot;black box&quot; and injectors (which I guess were
also bad) would have been in the $900 range, the carb will be around $500 or so.

This was one of the options I suggested to them way back, but was poo-pooed
as impractical -- &quot;you don't want to remove that fuel injection system!&quot; --
etc.   Since I'm not in Cal, the tyrannical emissions regulations are not a
problem.  Question: has anyone else gone this route with a bus? What are the
advantages/disadvantages?

(BTW, anyone interested in a '58 Euro Bug with semaphores, 1600cc, great
interior &amp; body, $3000 or trade for an used  HD Sportster 883?)
