Subject: Re:  speedo glass/lighting question

&gt;The glass has fallen in, in my '71 bus speedo. And, the lighting is
&gt;VERY dim, despite all the bulbs being good. The fuel gauge, to the
&gt;left, is still plenty bright. Are these two events
&gt;related? Does anyone know how to lift the glass back up, and
&gt;fasten it in place where it originally was? Now, it has dropped down
&gt;flat about 1/4 inch, and rattles against the face of the speedo.
I doubt they are related.  About the glass, it's hard to explain, but it seems
to be held in by a metal ring in back that kind of cuts into the plastic of
the dash cluster.  (Kind of a weird design, IMHO.)  My dash cluster was
broken at the places where the metal ring dug in, so I just used super glue
and it seems to do pretty good, though obviously I don't press on it.  About
the lights, I got mine working pretty good by cleaning and in some cases
replacing connections and wiring.  Bentley and (I believe) Haynes both have
good wiring diagrams.  Oh, and don't forget to check ground connections, too.
