  So I am going after VWoA to fix it for me and pay at least 80% of the bill.
  Hope this is clear to you now. At the time I am writing this up my 84 vanagon
  is dripping coolant too. About nearly a quart a week...

  I think it's appropriate to pursue this with VWoA, please don't misunderstand
  me. I would expect them, however, to  try and wiggle out of it on account of
  the age of the vehicle. Although the mileage is low, they may argue that the
  odometer cable had been disconnected or some such thing. Does anyone know
  if there is a &quot;statute of limitations&quot; or something like that VW may use
  to deny secret warranty coverage in a situation like this. What made me 
  uneasy was that they wanted to take the engine apart, most likely at your
  expense, BEFORE a determination of how much financial assistance would be
  provided by VWoA. 

  Has anyone's experience shown that VW has engineered a solution to this 
  problem - is the engine updated during these repairs? Or does the cycle of
  corrosion and subsequent leakage repeat itself. The rebuilder in Sacramento
  showed me some failed heads and they are pretty ugly! I hadn't realized how
  deep the pitting could get before the leakage would be bad enough that the
  owner would initiate repairs. 

  Good luck, David
