Subject: Re: Gas heater (not revisited)

Raul,

I've never delt with Art or had any contacts with him.  I understand 
he is very knowledgable and is prolly the best source (other than 
junkyards maybe?).  Anywho, he will mostlikely NOT give you a bum 
steer.  There's another guy out in Colorado BJ's Heater service (or 
something like that) check out the ads in the VW mags.  He's in 
there.  Maybe give him a call to get a comparison on 
prices/confirmation of type.  Tho' I've heard some negatives about 
him and heard that Art is better.  Both are expensive...

I've heard that Stewart Warners are dangerous and Eberspachers (The 
BN - BA types) are excellent.  I have a BA-6 installed in my '65 
Deluxe.  It throws heat like a salamander.  (I have the cracked 
windsheilds to prove it!)
