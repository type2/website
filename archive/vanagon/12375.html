&gt; I've camped a lot in the highway 395 area, and I personally don't like 
&gt; Red Rock that much. Very barren and dry looking.

It should be full of flowers when we are there.  I doubt you would be
disappointed...
&gt; 
&gt; Nearby, and at a higher elevation, is another Forest Service Campground 
&gt; called Lone Pine Campground; it's on the road to Whitnet Portal. This 
&gt; place is gorgeous! Fabulous views from almost every camp site.
&gt; 
&gt; If we're going this far, why not go to a prettier (and cooler) place?

I don't think it will be tire-melting hot there.  Probably very pleasant,
and I agree with Steve Johnson about the desireability of warmth and
dryness on this trip.  :)
