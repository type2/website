Subject: 86 GL W-syncro - Instrument Problems

Hello listees, 
Here is an &quot;anyone else out there had this&quot; question:

I noticed just the other day that my tach quits wotking and my eng. temp
gauge flashes when I turn on my lights. Using the dimmer dial for the
instr. lights I get half a tach reading and the temp gives another
result. Checked fuses, wires, connections, etc to a moderate extent, no
removal of anything but the dash cowling, and no results. The oddest
thing was when I removed the fuse for the instr. lights the tach worked
w/lights on and the temp gauge flashed to no end.

The film (plastic) holding the circuits for the panel seems to be OK,
just recently bought this rig and can recall it working fine previously.

I am also curious about the replacement of instrument light bulbs. They
are fixed in the white mount pretty securely.

Anyone out there have a similar situation? Solution? Area to target?

Money to the list account from a quiet member, too.
