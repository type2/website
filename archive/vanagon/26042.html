&gt;         My name is Charlie Orchard, and I am interested in buying a late
&gt; sixties/early seventies Bus.  What should I look for or be wary about?
&gt; What should I pay particular attention to when I examine a Bus?  What
&gt; issues  do you
&gt; experienced Bus owners feel I should be informed about?

You know, do we have a FAQ to point people to about this, common
engine tests (sort of an improved summary of Muir) common rust
spots, analyzing steering linkage condition, checking boots
on ball joints, cv's etc.  If not, I'd volunteer to organize a few
thoughts, but would need submissions from split window people
as I got no real clue there.
