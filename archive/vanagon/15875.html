&gt; anyhoo, was anybody stupi ... er, Dedicated (yeah, that's it!) enough to
&gt; buy this thing? :)  i'm kinda curious as to the quality/etc.
&gt; 
A friend of mine got one, and it is really nice, just WAY too expensive.
The quality is excellent. I confess I bought their Beetle for $90.00 a
few years back, and it was really nice as well, however, If they had had
the bus then, I would have bought it instead of the Bug. Of course, that
was back before i had a real split, and spent every penny on it!
:)
(which I think I would rather do anyway...)
