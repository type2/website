Subject: Re: Caravelle?

I can supply all T3 and T4 badges, original VW, straight from the dealer.

Brian.


&gt;
&gt;A Caravelle is the model name for the T3 and T4 passenger vans sold by VW in 
&gt;Europe. There are at least two Caravelle models, the CL and GL. The EuroVan 
&gt;CL and GL are the equivilant of the Caravelle CL and GL. The Vanagon 
&gt;nameplate is a US/Canada only name. WHat you saw was either a Euro version 
&gt;or a T3 which someone put on European badging.
&gt;
&gt;The European badging is available from a number of sources. As I recall Joel 
&gt;says he has a &quot;Transporter&quot; badge on his Vanagon. The &quot;Transporter&quot; badge is 
&gt;for the delivery van versions of the T3/T4. My EuroVan MV carries the 
&gt;&quot;MultiVan&quot; badging.
