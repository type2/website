Well Walt,
You and Joel are both right.
They are supposed to adjust automatically with the starwheel lever
when you apply the brakes while rolling backwards...   But they rarely
work.  Once your van gets it's first taste of rain and picks up a 
bit of road grit, that auto adjuster starts slipping off of the star.

looking at the ends of the slaves it's clockwise to tighten.
