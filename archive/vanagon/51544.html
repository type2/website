&gt;  Anyone with an 87 vanagon with a/c that had the recall service
&gt;  performed--i.e. metal support brace added to ceiling piece so it doesn't
&gt;  fall down and konk someone on the head.  Is the new support visible? 
&gt;  What does it look like or is there no difference in appearance?
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; It is well hidden.

   My AC in my 1986 Syncro is also falling down. Has it been recalled?
