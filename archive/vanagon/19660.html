Subject: Re: Loose CV bolts



To All:

When you order a CV boot KIT (about $9) it comes with a new boot bonded and
crimped to the metal shield, 90 grams of grease, the required boot clamp, a
new snap ring and two internally splined washers.   AND SIX NEW BOLTS.

I know; some model/year kits aren't available from J. C. Whitney (source of
the above), the point here is the contents of the kit.  Bolts used in
critical areas are normally not reused.  The threaded bore is made perfectly
grease-free, treated with loc-tite primer, and new bolts installed with
medium strength loc-tite.

In front of me I have a CV kit for a late model VW.  The bolts are 8x1.25.
 If torqued to 25 ft/lbs the tension in the bolt will be about 7,000 psi at
normal room temperatures, as much as twice that as the CVs heat up from
normal use.  With six such fasteners, properly installed, it is extremely
unlikely they would come loose in normal service.

I think it would be wise to look beyond the bolts for the cause of the
problem.  It's possible the CV joint is imbalanced, or the cage and balls are
mis-matched or perhaps the bolts were not torqued evenly in a criss-cross
pattern.  

The fact the bolts loosened and backed-out is a symptom of a problem, not the
problem itself.
