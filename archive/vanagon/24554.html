Thanks for your replies, Joel, Frank, and John! Unfortunately, there
doesn't seem to be a consensus. :( The contentious proposition was: &quot;there
exists a phosphate-free coolant, which is green and approved by VW.&quot;
Master Joel says &quot;bull.&quot; Frank and John, however, say &quot;true,&quot; although
they suggest caution. Looks like I'm gonna hafta call VWoA. Will keep you
posted.
