VV&gt;all you Unknowns could be helping out here, instead of lurking 
VV&gt;behind the tire rack at the Great Garage of the Internet (Last 
VV&gt;Chance Garage?). just a little note (to me, of course) and You, Too, 
VV&gt;Can Be A Statistic! ;) 

Ok I am from Greenville in Orange County NY. and have an 84 Vanagon!
