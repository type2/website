&gt;&gt;Hey all,

&gt;&gt;the wonder of economics in action).  Any ideas?

&gt;Probably a VW
&gt;only item.  My bus is equally disassembled, and I've been meaning to

&gt;
&gt;As to whether or how much it improves engine operation, I don't know.
&gt;Anyone?
&gt;
&gt;My question is, if/when I get this filter thingy, what kind of
&gt;adjustments are necessary in terms of a tune-up to make the engine run
&gt;correctly?  Also, how do you test the EGR valve to determine that it's
&gt;working?

I just replaced the EGR filter on my '81 Westy a few months ago, along with
the muffler and catalytic converter.  It's gawd-awful expensive -- almost
as much as the Brazilian muffler (which is thoroughly rusted already!).
When I bought the vehicle a few years ago, the EGR filter was rusted out
and the valve was disconnected from the throttle and blocked off by a
sheet-metal plate between the EGR valve and the up-tube from the filter.
When I had the cat-converter replaced, I learned that California will now
require that for my next inspection, not only must all emissions control
equipment be installed, but that it be WORKING, too!  So a couple of weeks
ago I finally got around to hooking the thing back up.  Fortunately, the
EGR valve cleaned up easily and didn't need that expensive rebuild
available in SoCal.  Be careful of the gasket -- it's supposed to have only
a small (~ 1/16&quot;) hole to transmit exhaust gasses, not the full tube inside
diameter.

The test of operation is to open the EGR valve when the engine is at idle.
If the engine runs rough, the valve is opening properly.  I adjusted the
linkage to the throttle per my Haynes manual.  The effect I have seen is a
noticeable increase in power and top speed, and a 20-degree (I swear!)
decrease in engine oil temperature, measured by the sender in the sump
plate.  One other effect is a mild increase in fuel consumption, but that
may just be because I'm enjoying the extra 5-10 mph on my daily commute.
I've now resumed normal driving speeds and hope to see the mileage improve
again.
