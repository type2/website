&gt; 
&gt; &gt;boy. can you guys just imagine if we could DRIVE from, say, labrador to
&gt; &gt;greenland to iceland to norway or some such? just being able to drive a
&gt; &gt;car all the way to europe? :)  what a trip!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;joel
&gt; 
&gt; My 1972 bus was one of the first vehicles to actually drive overland across
&gt; the tundra to Labrador. This was in or about 1987. We were celebrities
&gt; up there.
&gt; 
&gt; 

	Lest anyone get the wrong impression...Derek means he drove
	over LAND (tundra) from SomeWhere, presumably Quebec.

	He DID NOT mean drive across frozen OCEAN from one land mass to 
	another!

	Eh?
