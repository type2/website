Subject: Re: Questions on a 2nd battery

I'd be interested in the answers to these questions also, please make replies public on this topic! Thanks!

&gt;Now that I have the inverter, I want to get a second battery.  I've read
&gt;most of the archive on this subject, and have a few questions on this
&gt;oft-covered topic:
&gt;
&gt;1)  I understand why I need a deep-cycle battery.  I also know that I want
&gt;    to stick the battery under the drivers' seat.  The question, then, is
&gt;    what is the best deep-cycle battery for the job that doesn't 'stick out'
&gt;    of the battery compartment?  And where would I get it?
&gt;
&gt;2)  A relay isolator sounds preferable to a diode isolator, but I've looked
&gt;    around and no one seems to carry the switched isolator.  Where would I
&gt;    find a relay isolator that can be switched off of the ignition?
&gt;
&gt;3)  Are there any recommendations for shops in the bay area that would do a
&gt;    good job installing a second battery?

&gt;4)  Assuming that I don't want to run a TV, VCR, or microwave oven, how
&gt;    large of a battery do I really need?  (Mostly, I want to run a laptop
&gt;    computer and perhaps an external drive.)
