&gt;I have an 87 vanagon with a/c, but the rear of the cabin still gets bakin'
&gt;hot.  I've seen rear side window vents on some newere vanagons and would
&gt;like to mod my van with these vents.
&gt; -has anybody ever done this?
&gt; -source for the vents
&gt; -can it be done--are the windows the same shape?

well, it CAN be done, but i'm not so sure you'd want to ... all that &quot;vent&quot;
thingie consists of is a plastic box with a piece of foam in it. and the
only difference (that i can see) in the glass is that it is shorter.

as i understand it, the plastic vent thingie is to allow air to be sucked
out the back, if you open the dash vents. otherwise it does nothing.

to cool down the rear, put some tint on the windows ... this REALLY makes a
difference in the temperature inside. and you can get the stuff at k-mart
and put it on yourself (just follow the directions carefully). the vanagon's
(or buses) windows are flat and very easy to work on. the only problem's i've
had (in putting the tint on) were the handles for the sliding windows, and
being very very careful on the rear hatch window when trimming the tint (so
you don't cut any of the defroster wires).

the color of the bus also makes a big difference. those folks with white
buses are the coolest. makes you wonder why vw quit painting the tops of buses
white. i'm still thinking about painting my roof white before next summer
(and i've been saying that for seven years!!! :)
