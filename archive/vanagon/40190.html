Subject: RE: Lotsa gauges


How about we all work together and make this big monster guage and then 
advertise it as &quot;The last guage you will ever need.&quot;  Not only does it 
come fully equipped with all the critical engine guages, but with built 
in mechanical guages like feeler guages, and spark plug guages.  And I 
think we should build it right here in Beatrice, NE because Beatrice is 
in Gage County!

We could use a color LCD read out (like a laptop screen) and have a foot 
pedal attatched to it so you can cycle through all the engine analysis 
functions.  That way, if you need to check that pesky #3 cylinder and you 
have remembered that istonly take 150 clicks to cycle through everything 
to get to that function, you've got your temps right there handy with a 
press (or 2) of the foot pedal.  Heck it could come with a giant wiring 
harness so that you can hook it up to your passengers to check and see 
what their brain functions are like.  Just think, you could be the first 
to experience &quot;Bio-Feedback Driving.&quot;  

And if we built it with a massive Heads Up Display, you could attempt to 
keep your eyes focused on the road.  You'd be able to look at it and say, 
&quot;What the heck?  My gas flow hydrometer must not be calibrated correctly 
- the needle is jumping all over the place,&quot; and then you realize that it 
was the line down the center of the road that you were confusing with your 
transparent HUD.

I better stop while I'm ahead, I am getting way out of hand...
