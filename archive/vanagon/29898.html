Subject: '80+ van questions

Hi, folks.  I'm looking at early 80s Westfalias as my next vehicle, and
after digging through the FAQ, the archives and whatever else I could find,
I still have a couple of questions.

How's the heat in the post-80 vans, both for passengers and the front seats?
I noticed a lot of discussion in the archives about heat sources for the
pre-80 stuff, which I can understand (I had a '62 Bug, a '68 Sqback, and my
sister has a '69 Ghia).

I've noticed in the archives and the newspaper that people are stuffing
anything from Audi engines to Rabbit engines in these buses.  Is it an easy
swap to put a watercooled engine from a mid-80s bus into an aircooled slot?
Or is any swap a bear, so people end up going with higher-powered plants?

Lastly, anybody want to trade a Westy and about $4000 for an '88 Chevy 2WD
truck in great shape? :-)
