So mike mulliganshaw says:
&gt; 
&gt; i'm interested in a 1977 for $6500
&gt; and i am intereseted in seeing if this is a good price.
&gt; compared to what other people have seen,
&gt; here's the specs
&gt; 
&gt; 1977 champagne edition
&gt; 76k miles
&gt; driven in summers
&gt; stored at dry 50 degrees in winter
&gt; in other word taken really good care of,
&gt; no major ouch
&gt; standard
&gt; pedigree available

What the hell does this mean?
You get a free dog with it?  ;p

&gt; one driver
&gt; 7 passenger
&gt; no air
&gt; 
&gt; so, what do yall think,

Too expensive.  For that kind of money, I'd rather buy one
for maybe $2K and fix it up.  That way, I'd know that it
was worth the money I put into it.
