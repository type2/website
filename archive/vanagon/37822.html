&gt;&gt;HTVW&amp;DB did an article on correcting this problem a few years ago.  As I
&gt;&gt;recall it was a good article.
&gt;
&gt;You can't be serious.  HVW and &quot;good article&quot; do not belong in the same
&gt;sentence...

Even DB&amp;HVWs has been known to occasionally get it right, unlikely
tho that may seem.

Lucille Ball: &quot;I'll bet you think I'm a perfect idiot!&quot;
Her Boss: &quot;*Nobody's* perfect.&quot;
