Ok...so I'm wrong about the passenger divisions on T2 &amp; T3 Type 2s...
however after living with a 9 passenger Caravelle for a month in France in 
94 I can equivically state there is no support wall or any other kind of 
wall behind the front seat.

BTW didja know that there are 11 passenger T4s? Yep, one can get the 9 pass 
configuration with two side-mounted jump seats in the rear luggage 
compartment.
