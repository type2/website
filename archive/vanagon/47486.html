Subject: (f) Story that includes a VW

Just a story that includes a VW.

Cast of characters:
Chris - a cousin of mine
Billy Jack - cousin's friend &amp; a lifelong quadriplegic with 
no control of limbs and very little neck muscle control.
 
Chris was driving Billy Jack somewhere in a VW
&lt;see I told you it included a VW&gt;
and ended up driving said bug off the road &lt;boo, hiss&gt; 
No injuries, no damage to VW, &lt;yeah, clap&gt;
He just needed to tow it back on road.

Well Chris got Billy Jack out of the car and onto the side
of the road and propped him up against a road sign.
Chris then went to find a phone, leaving Billy Jack alone.

After awhile someone noticed the crashed VW and stopped
and asked if everyone was ok.  Billy Jack's answer?
&quot;I'm fine, but you should see the other guy!&quot;
