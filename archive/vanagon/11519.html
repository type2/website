&gt; So, as the time approaches, we have reached the point of deciding
&gt; exactly what we wish to do for our little soiree. Stefan and I met today
&gt; and discussed the possiblilties for communal meals, so now we cast the
&gt; vote- who is interested in doing such a thing? Do we want to do a dinner
&gt; and a breakfast, or what? Should we assign folks to bring various things?
&gt; Anyway, all interested parties please respond. I plan to head out there
&gt; Friday the 17th around lunch time to pick the best spot, and set up
&gt; camp. I will leave directions at the main gate as to where exactly we
&gt; will be. Remember, the gates will be closing at 6:00. So, if you are
&gt; planning on coming, please let us know your thoughts. Also, if you don't
&gt; see your name on the list, please tell us, as well as thoughts on when
&gt; you will be arriving. As always, all the pertinent information is
&gt; below...
&gt; thanks

    I think a communal meal or two would be great.  How about a Friday 
evening meal?  I would be happy to pitch in on the organizing side of 
things also.  Three of us (and one dog) are planning on arriving Friday 
between 3 and 6.  BTW, I'm in Chapel Hill.  I may also recruit some 
others from the area who may not be on the list, and may print up 
some fliers and distribute them.
