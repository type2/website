Subject: Tools, lamps, 'accessory' list

	I agree with Harvey and Bill- you get what you pay for, when
you're lucky!  And the guy with a wharehouse in the Midwest who
buys $0.17 screwdrivers in Xian and sells them for $0.49 isn't a
friend of you OR the Chinese people who make the tools.
	 I *hate* cheap tools that break or let me down. I've 
bought good tools from Taiwan, from Japan, from USA, Germany, Italy. 
I bought a pretty good acoustic bass guitar from Korea. None of 'em were 
cheap. I always buy tools with the intention of owning them for
the rest of my life, or until I give them away. This makes it easier
to pay 2 or 3 times as much for the good tool instead of the cheap one.

	Hey, way to go Ron! It starts with gooseneck lamps, but
pretty soon you're gonna be putting in a gas heater and talking
fuel injection with Eugene!

	Snorfle! Martha, you have no mercy!
