Subject: Dying in the rain 2

&gt;I might just change the plug wires, and the coil wire, but the cap has n=
o
cracks and was just replaced, I still have the old nice and clean looking=

one.(and the problem still shows when going through the wet)

On the last tune up(from a different place)o2 level was checked and
adjusted, now the van gets about 550km per tank of gas, it was getting
about 350km before.
(bosch parts were used both times)
(will try the mister bottle on the electrical hoping not to get a shock)

Thanks for all the help

I had a problem with one of the plug wires shorting to the fuel injector
wire and another to the metal spark plug protector.  I found it using the=

mister approach.  Good luck.
