Subject: Re: Rust treatment, or repair?

Ric,

The chemical I'm using is called One Step and I haven't seen the return 
of seedlings you described. I'll keep an eye out for them, though. I'm 
looking at compressors now for the purpose of blasting and painting. I 
looked at a 4 1/2 HP yesterday, but I may go to 5 as you did. I'm also 
planning on purchasing a spray gun. I have a cheap sand blaster that's 
simply a hose with a blasting nozzle. It works, but I can't say I'm 
jumping up and down with elation at the speed. It'll probably do fine for 
this one bus, but I may treat myself to a better unit for future restos.

Thanks! Joe
