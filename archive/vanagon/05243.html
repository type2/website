I don't know what the purpose is but I strongly suspect that they add a great
deal to the structural integrity of the bus.  If you look at them closely
they're welded in and have what looks like a major support bar running along
the top of them.

I installed custom reclining seats in Bobo but was afraid to remove the
seperators.  I just put up with the fact that the seats only recline a few
inches before hitting the wall.  Just being able to sit upright in the
seats is worth it since they're so much more comfortable than the original
seats (not that the new seats are that great, it's just that the stock ones
were HORRIBLE!)

As usual, them's just my opinions.

John
