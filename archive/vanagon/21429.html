&gt; I had a '69 camper with all the camping options several years ago (RIP) and the

&gt; brackets which mounted on the bus pillars. It was only big enough for a small
&gt; (very) adult or child but convenient for storing gear off the floor while
&gt; camping. I never had anyone actually sleep in one so I don't know how
&gt; comfortable they are for that purpose.

 In both our '69 and '72 campers we managed to sleep our whole family of 
five.  My parents had the fold down 'big' bed.  We kids took turns 
between the front cot, the pop top cot and on the floor under the 
front of the big bed.  When we were really young (when we first got the 
'69 I was 8 and my younger brother was 6) we put two in the front cot.

We lived for 2 to 3 weeks at a time in the Campmobile.  Family 
togetherness of course a necessity :)
