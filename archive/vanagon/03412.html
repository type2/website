&gt; 
&gt; So, I did them one better.  I took an old piece o'shit gas can a friend gave
&gt; me, put 2 gallons of gas in it, along with 3 cups of good ol C &amp; H (pure
&gt; cane sugar), and put the gas can on the roof rack, with a couple of bungees
&gt; to hold it down.

 I hereby nominate you as &quot;Genius of the week&quot; for this one. Thanks
for telling us. I am ROTFL right now, and genuinely sharing in your
joy. {A real S*&amp;^t-eating grin I have}.

 My now second (was first) favorite idea was to take a nearly empty
sugar bag, sprinkle a bit around the gas cap, and place the bag under the
cap wedged under a tire (With the gas-flap left open). {no sugar in gas,
just let them *think* there is}

 Best Friday story yet Thom...thanks again.

Matthew
