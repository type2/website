&gt;If you do buy some hose I would be interested in purchasing a foot of it.

I bit and I bought.  It had to be ordered, so I'm still awaiting its arrival.

&gt;P.S.  VW Bus Heaven will sell the exact length for $20.00 shipping included.

That does save you about $9, so I guess they *are* doing you a favor.
And they're doing themselves a favor - the 'fiche at the local dealer says
that you need something like 288mm, and you can get 17 of those from a 5m
coil of hose.  $340 (less shipping and $20 (they're likely cost)) is a
pretty good return.

If I devide my cost (plus tax), throw in a &quot;Priority Mail&quot; envelope for
$2.90, and charge $5.00, I still make a few cents to cover my troubles.
The postage costs more than the product.

I'll let you know when it comes in...
