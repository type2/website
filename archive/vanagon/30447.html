Subject: Christmas in London

Any one in London?

A bus buddy called last night and after
discussions of which bus runs and which
bus does not, he said he will be spending
December 22-30 in London with his sister.

Any one on the Isle interested in meeting
a homegrown USofA bus person?
Dan has a 66 camper he stores here,
a 73 Thing, and is in NEATO/TTT.

Any leads appreciated.
