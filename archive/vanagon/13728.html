Subject: Re: VW rotor govenor

&gt;  I think the rotor governers were used on '72 -'74 twin carb Type IV engines,
&gt;  not the earlier upright fan engines. The parts place always asks me if I
&gt;  want the $30.00 one for my '74 or a $4.00 one from a '71 &lt;which is what
&gt;  I use&gt;

My motto:
Build your engine right, drive it well and forget the high priced junk 
designed for the morons!
