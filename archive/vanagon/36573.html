Subject: '60 Tranny problem

     I went to see my new '60 single cab yesterday and when giving it a 
     test drive i couldn't get it into first or second gear. yet the guy 
     selling it could, although with a little difficulty.
     
     now i'm well used to difficult tranny shifts so i don't thinks its 
     just me.
     
     there was no problem getting it into reverse or 3rd or 4th.
     
     the bushing at the shifter end has been replaced.
     
     does anyone have any ideas about obvious problems that it could be?
     
     by the was there is virtually zero rust on this baby, like a small 
     hole 5mm in one of the rocker panels.
     
     Lee.
