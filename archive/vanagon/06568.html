So martha rubin says:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm a little confused about this matter of catalytic converters and
&gt; their relative safeness.  Must they be vented to be safe?  If they
&gt; are not vented, how would it differ, say, from me using my built-in
&gt; westy stove to heat the interior of the car while camping?  For
&gt; that matter, the stove is vented, so wouldn't that qualify?
&gt; 
&gt; dazed and confused...

You'll be more than dazed and confused if you run the stove all night
with no venting Martha!!!  I don't know how you came to the understanding
that the stove is vented, but that is totally wrong!  As a matter of 
fact the manual insists on at least a window being open at all times
when using the stove.  I wouldn't recommend using the stove as a heat
source since it's an open flame even with the window open.  And I think
even David Garth mentioned that he likes to leave a window cracked even
though his vented system has a built in safety shut-off feature.  The
fact is that when you burn, the combustion process consumes oxygen.  You
need oxygen to breath.  No insult intended, just concern.  I've heard 
many stories about people trying to keep warm in cars while stuck in
the snow only to be found dead because they didn't crack a window to
let in oxygen.  So leave a window cracked open if you intend to have
any type of combustion going on in your vehicle.
