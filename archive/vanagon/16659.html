&gt;If nobody takes them they will be pitched in the dumpster next weekend.
&gt;Steve Maher, are you listening?  Do you want them?

Yes and no.

Geez, Dave, they sound great. But I have no real use for such, and no
place to store them-- especially since I may be moving to a different
part of San Diego soon. Appreciate the offer/headsup/whatever that was,
though.

BTW, I put some little clamps on the front springs of the '66, and 
installed the new rear leaf springs (finally). What a HUGE difference.
No longer have to be afraid of every little bump-- the Coupevertible
is fun now, and aligns correctly! No more front-tire-screeching with
heavy throttle application. Drove it all over SD/La Jolla Sunday-- what
a blast!

Now I have some parts for sale, cheap:

rear leaf springs for '66 coupe. Used, need re-arching. $20/pair.
KYB Gas-adjust shocks for front of '66 coupe. Used, good cond. $15/pair.
Rear top cover for '66 Conv. New, never used. '65 white. $25.
