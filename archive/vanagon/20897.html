Subject: '56 kombi brakes yet again...
Date: Sun, 16 Jul 1995 22:34:47 -0700 (PDT)

Yo,

	I played with the bus brakes again today.

	I was grazing thru the catlogs the other night, and started noticing
the brake springs and stuff, and it occurred to me that maybe I have the
wrong springs...

	So I went to pick 'n pull today, and scrounged some springs (and a
30 pict 2).

	I put the springs on, although I had to drill some new holes in the
brake shoes for them to go into.

	This appears to have fixed the problem with the brakes dragging.  The
old springs were kinda loose, and these are tight now!  The brakes do not
drag, and I even was able to adjust them like you would on a normal bus.

	Do I dare hope that the problem is fixed?

Thom
