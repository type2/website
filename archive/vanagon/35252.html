Subject: Westy FS, Austin TX

Long suffering father (and friend of mine) has decided insuring #1 son's
'78 westy (which spends most days in UT parking lot) makes no
sense....Friend Steve advises bus has 105K miles, 7.5K since $3,500
(?????) in dampers, tires, hoses etc. All accessories are working. Can be
seen in Austin or, with a bit of advance notice, Houston.

Pls. e mail me for additional info.

Moe
