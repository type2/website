A couple of things....

Stay on the coast around the Rt1 area...the best place to be
is north of Portland. The ferry trip to Canada is a neat trip.
It can be done in a minimum of 24 hrs. You can leave Portland
around 8pm. The ferry has food, entertainment and gambling.

Get a cabin for the night trip. The deluxe ones have showers, etc..
When you arrive in Yarmouth, you have the option, assuming you
book in advance, to do an overnighter in Yarmouth. The scenery
is nice for day tripping...there's not much in Yarmouth per se..

Or the ferry does a 2 hour turn-around and then heads back to
Portland. I would suggest spending the $20 to get a cabin..

You get back to Portland around 6 or 7 pm.

Other things...Freeport...LLBean. Unfortunately this sleepy little
town has become yuppie-tourist-hell. I used to go to LLBean years ago..
and Freeport was this lovely sleepy little town with one restaurant, one
gas station and Beans...now there's factory outlets up the wazooo...
Bimmer, MBz and Volvo types (I hope I haven't totally offended anyone..)
up the wazoo as well. It can get crowded.

Places to visit... you MUST go to Wiscassett to see the &quot;ghost&quot; ships.
There are two turn of the century cargo sailing vessels which were
abandoned in the harbor 50 years ago or so...they have deteriorated
to such an extent they look like ghost ships...and have become a
rather off-beat tourist attraction.

Campgrounds....I stayed at one off of Rt1 in Damariscotta (sp?)
a number of years ago...right on a little bay. There's a nice
one that LiMBO used for Busses by the Bouy this past year...unfortunately
I don't have the name of it. Joel....do you have October/November
Transporter issue with the busses by the bouy write-up?  If that
doesn't work the person who set up the event was Jaci Hart call
her at (207) 586-6188.


Hope this helps...

If you want Cetin...you could always park your van down near
our beach!
