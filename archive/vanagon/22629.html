Subject: Tire pressure for 195R14C?

On my 85' Caravelle-turned-camper, I have Kelly 195R14C tires. 
They came with the bus, but the previous owner was unsure what 
the recommended air pressure should be. The instruction book and
the plate at the right door only lists 185R14Cs.
Do you have similar tires, and if so what pressures do you use?
