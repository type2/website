Subject: T-Shirt Alert!

Got this shirt over Xmas holiday, and had to wait until I got back to 
work AND for a Friday to post.

I recently procurred, from a shop in Tahoe City (Lake Tahoe, Calif), a 
really neat T-shirt.

I'll describe it here and provide an address and give a phone number for 
the shop.  The CCC's will be camping (yeah right, at a cabin) about 3 
miles from this shop and could be persuaded to make a trip into town 
for purposes of procuring with the intent of crossing state lines!

On the back:
Large frontal view drawing of a splittie with the small square pop up 
camper in the up position, with a bicycle, a pair of skiis, and a surfboard 
poking out from behind on the back rack.  On the passenger side there 
appears to be a climbing rope and ice axe.  Splittie is a very light brown, 
blacked out windows and headlights, with dark green bike frame and 
other details in maroon.  Just a touch of the passenger side showing.

Text arranged in a circle around the bus are the words:

Every time the wheel goes around, you're bound to cover a little more 
ground

On the front:
The same drawing, but smaller in the left pocket area (no pocket), 
with the words below it reading:

ROAD TRIP . . . `97
    Lake Tahoe

Available in white or light grey on ONEITA 100% cotton preshrunk.
I paid $17 for it.  Well $16.95 plus tax actually.

I've scanned the shirt, but have no place to post it to the net for you to 
see.  Any volunteers?  Back image is BIG, while front pocket image 
may be more managable and shows the same drawing.  Just let me know 
what format you need.

It appeared to be of local manufacture, as the 'Lake Tahoe' lettering 
matched the rest too well for one of those generic 'Wish you were here 
in &lt;insert town here&gt;' T-shirts, so may not be available elsewhere.  
No indication on the shirt of the artist or maker.

The clerk I bought it from is a bug person (her's has survived 2 
avalanches!)
