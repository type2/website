&gt;With all that we know,  why would anyone place additional risk on thier
&gt;children by placing them in the front seat?  Barely makes sense if there are
&gt;no seats left in rear.

A lot of people just don't care. How many times have you seen a car with the
kids not belted in, just bouncing around? 

As for airbags and ABS, If I could afford a car with them I'd get it. This
is technology that works!

Anyone up for an informal survey?   How many of you NEVER wear a seat belt?
