Subject: Gen Int: A Plea for Sanity

I agree whole heartedly with a way to automagically sort the posts into easy
categories that I can choose to read now or archive for future reference. I
have gone to digest mode but have a hard time wading through it. In regular
mail mode, I sometimes delete other mail accidentally while purging list
stuff of no interest.
