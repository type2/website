Subject: 81 Westy FS in NJ

81 4-speed Westfalia, minor dents but no rust (imported from CA), camping
stuff all works, 135k on van, 35?k on engine, $6800 negotiable.  Owner
describes it as &quot;the color of a basketball&quot;, which I thought was good;
I knew what he meant right away.  It's in Rutherford NJ; I haven't seen it
but might go, just to stay current on the sparse NJ Vgon market.

Same issue of the paper has VW 91 Camper, 72k, air, &quot;like new&quot; $19k.

Oops phone numbers: 81 201-933-3771   91 201-447-5441

No back-talk pls. about what a 81 Vgon in California would need to be made
of to be worth $6800.
