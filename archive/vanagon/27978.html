Subject: re:Shocks for lowered bus

VW67BG_at_aol_dot_com screamed at us with this question:

&gt;CAN I USE A STOCK SHOCK IF THE BEAM IS ONLY TURNED ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN?

I wouldn't think so, have you talked to your local FLAPS to see if they
have something similar, how about RMMW, or one of the other advertisers
in the VW rags.

My eyes still hurt from the yelling you did.

BTW: You CAN turn the caps lock OFF

Cheers,

BACK IN 1990 WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND MORE FOOLISH I LOWERED MY
64 DELUXE SUNROOF BUS. I UNDERSTAND THAT BUS BOYS(YOU KNOW, THE
PARTS GUYS YOU CAN NEVER GET) HAS AN UPDATED SHOCK FOR THEIR LOWERED FRONT
END, I HAVE TRIED TO ORDER THESE TO NO AVAIL. HAS ANYONE HAD ANY EXPERIENCE
WITH A LOWERED BUS WHAT IS THE BEST FRONT SHOCK TO USE. CAN I USE A STOCK
SHOCK IF THE BEAM IS ONLY TURNED ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN? ANY HELP WOULD BE
GREATLY APPRECIATED.                                              GERALD
