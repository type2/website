Yes, most decidedly!  I owned a '95 Eurobago, weighed 4750 lbs., and
had a noticeable port quarter list.  The VW put a &quot;shim?&quot; on the left
rear shock; it helped a bit, but did not alleviate the problem.  Every
time I saw a Eurobago parked, which were few and far between, I would
scramble to check its level.  Invariably, these other campers looked
level and this only fueled my paranoia.
