To the folks offering responses to this post -- THANKS!
Just wanted to reassure you all that I do have the Bentley
book and a Chiltons (yeah, right :).  I'm ordering the
Tom Wilson book tonight.

Still want to know how folks get that clutch slave-cylinder
bolt off... I could get a socket on it, but no driver or u-joint
would fit... can't get a wrench on it either.  Am going
to put an Allen head bolt in there when I put it together :)
