&gt; ok. so what have we got?
&gt; 1. joints need grease.
&gt; 2. more grease is better than less grease.
&gt; 3. grease dries out. needs cleaning off and replacing.
&gt; 4. joint boots dry out and crack and get cut. need replacing eventually.
&gt; 5. flipping/reversing should extend the life of the joint for a while longer.
&gt; 6. bolts can be a bitch to get out. best to have lots of options.
&gt; 7. star-bolts is better bolts if you can get them.
&gt; 8. re-check the bolts after a while. they might loosen up.
&gt; 
&gt; did i miss anything?

One thing that hasn't been mentioned is that when the cv's are removed
and disassembled for cleaning and repacking, my mechanic makes it a
point to mark each ball and it's associated socket. This way, upon
reassembly, each ball goes back into the same socket.

Seems to make sense to me.
