Subject: Eurovan Gauge strangeness

In the archives I notices some posts concerning Problems with the fuel 
and the temp gauges, sounded like a short or ground fault.  I have 
noticed this beginning to happen on mine.  

Has anyone solved this?  Or eliminated potential sources?

All help needed and appreciated!
