&gt;I would suspect that you have a poor connection at the temp sending unit.
 It
&gt;is located on the themostat housing.  Pull the connector off of the sensor
&gt;and enusure you have a good, clean contact.

No.  The light in the temperature gage has nothing to do with temperature.
 It is an indication of a low coolant level only.
