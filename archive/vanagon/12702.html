Subject: more unusual vanagons


When I was at one of the local junkyards this last weekend, I found a blue
vanagon window van, bare bones inside, was diesel + 5sp (unfortunately
gone), and with the wall behind the driver and passenger seats, just like
the old vans. The front seat was a bench-style one.
Never seen that wall in a vanagon (other than the double cab) before.
Probably not that unusual in europe, but was my first.

Alistair
