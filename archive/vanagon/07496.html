Seems like the 25% &quot;chicken tax&quot; passed earlier than the 1970's.
Anyone know the date for sure? (My guess is about 1963)

It must have been '63--since my brother bought a '62 transporter
with no seats.  I remember it WAS under Kennedy that the
tarif was put in place.  In '67, my transporter came with
a middle seat (otherwise bare behind the driver cab) so it
wasn't a &quot;truck&quot; but a passenger vehicle.  I think the 
Subaru Brats of the early '80s had two funny seats in the
back for the same reason.

Don't know if that tarif is still in place, however.  We
seem to deal with the Japanese with self-enforced quotas
rather than taxes....
