So Sarah 'Von' Gallagher says:
&gt; 
&gt; No, I'd say 'snobs' was the wrong word. Nazi Police, more like. 
                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^
Now that's what I call appropriate!  ;)

Don't you mean Gestapo??? :O

We could have the Luftwaffe (sp?) patrol!  ;p  And I just got through
sanding off my original swastika.  DOH!!! ;)

&gt; What on earth makes you lot think you can dictate to someone what they
&gt; should be doing with their car?

Obviously, we can't dictate anything to anybody.  This pot gets sturd
up about every 2 months or so....  

It's just that I see no point in lowering any utility vehicle.  What
are you trying to achieve?  Butt scraps?  :)
