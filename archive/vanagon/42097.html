Subject: Re: 12-point tool

S
SY&gt;So much for your last word.  I've had both the 12 point fasteners and the
SY&gt;standard allen head fasteners on CVs on VWs that have owned.  I would not
SY&gt;necessarily assume that a particular VW is equipped with one or the other.

Our '86 van had the triple square, my new '85 has hex, the '77 triple
square, the '78 hex, and of course any of these could have been changed
by a PO at any time, go figure.  All FWD VW's we've owned have been
similarly mixed.

Here is a very personal preference, on the '77 I changed back to
grade 12.9 hex heads I bought locally for $0.20 each, the reason.
Although indeed the triple square is much harder to round out if
impeccably clean, I find it far easier to pick the grease, dirt, crap,
out of the hex head and can always get a better solid fit quickly
with the regular allen.  Never rounded one out on a CV yet, you
simply must clean em out carefully bang the 6mm allen in with a good
hammer tap and you're set.  BTW K-D tools make a good quality
triple square as well, brobably a bit cheaper than that &quot;gold-plated&quot;
Snap-On.
