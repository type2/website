&gt; 
&gt; There is one way to resolve this issue: do an informal poll of those on
&gt; the list and determine who has their thermostat/flap system still set up
&gt; and those who don't and compare against engine life....DC
&gt; 
  Flaps in, thermostat connected, 105,000 miles, no problems, knock on wood.


  Unless I'm mistaken, the flaps and thermostat control only the lower limit
  on operating temperature - An engine without them is no less likely to 
  overheat. Furthermore, oil that does not reach operating temperature is 
  bad stuff to have in your engine. Acids are formed as oil oxidizes and 
  heating it up to &quot;boil&quot; them off is the only way to get rid of them, other
  than changing the oil. I suspect that there could be a relationship between 
  above average wear and oil in poor condition.
