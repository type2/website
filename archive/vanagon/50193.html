Subject: '80-'84 Westy front seats F.S. perfect cond.

I talked to a fellow at the Englishtown NJ show who has a '82? light blue,
ex-diesel, now 16 valve GTI engined Westy who had a PERFECT set of Westy front
seats for sale. These are the ones that come in the light blue (and maybe other
colors) westy's. They are tan background with brown, blue, and (some other color
that I don't remember) vertical stripes on them.  The seats are in excellent
cond and so is the padding. They look brand new. I told him I'd post this on the
list for him. I believe he's asking 300 for the pair.   His name is Sonny Young
and his phone# is  (814) 941-1979
