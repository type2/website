Subject:      heat exchanger round 2

 Thanks to all who responded to my question on the odor coming from my rear
heat exchanger.  As suggested I pulled off the cowling.   When I saw dried
residue on the lower hose connection I thought that this might be the source
of the coolant leak.  With a warm engine, very faint vapor trails rise  from
each end of the heat exchanger, and I can immeadiately smell the bitter
sweet odor.  I assume that this means the whole unit is shot, though I see
no coolant leaking. Do I need to replace the whole heat exchanger including
the fan?  It seems to be all one unit, and I think mine says it is made in
FRANCE.  Is this an original VW part? Could anyone tell me where I could
find a reasonably priced replacement, if in fact I need to replace the whole
unit?  Is there a good archive reference to replacement of the heat exchanger?

Sorry for the flood of questions.... again.
