Subject: next CCC's campout


In a meeting of delegates yesterday, it was decided to move the next upcoming
campout to the last weekend in August (the weekend where August changes
to September).  Not enough people are able to attend this coming weekend.
You may receive this message more than once.  :)


Stay tuned..
