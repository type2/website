Subject: Dormobile talk

     
     &gt;i guess you are you lucky dude. do you ever come across any Dormobile 
     &gt;stuff, a way over there across the pond?
     
     I had a friend who just sold an early ('60) Split Dormobile for 1000 
     quid. I've seen Dormobile advertizement fliers in with magazines at 
     swap meets. And did you know, that Dormobile fitted their elevating 
     roof conversions to the Devon camper conversions. My mate has a '67 
     Devon with a Dormobile top on it. For this reason you think you see 
     quite a lot of Dormobiles, but most turn out to be Devons. Dormobile 
     also converted Fords Transits, Bedfords, and Dodge Commers.
     
     Lee.
