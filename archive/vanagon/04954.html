So John Ritchie says:
&gt; 
&gt; I've never thought I'd care for a 4x4-type rig before but a Unimog!  YES!  I
&gt; want one!  That would be the ultimate all-purpose vehicle!  I would definitely
&gt; want mine with the camper option including the huge fuel tanks for extended
&gt; trips to Baja and who-knows-where!  Ooo!  Ooo!  8-)
&gt; Who cares if it costs as much as a house?  With the camper option you could
&gt; live in it too!  I wonder if the credit union would give me a mortgage on it
&gt; though?

Wow! A mobile community.  Let's see the tax mongrels charge for property tax
on these!  (They'd probably would charge a tax up front or at registration 
time :(  Oh well....)

&gt; Essentials.  Also, I propose that we adopt &quot;UrineVan&quot; as the list-approved
&gt; slang for the latest generation of bus.  Good one, Wizzer!  (All in favor say
&gt; &quot;Aye!&quot;)

Aye!

Make it so..
