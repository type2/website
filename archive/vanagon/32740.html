Subject: In contemplation of prices.

	The other night, in a fit of insomnia, I was lying in bed 
thinking about my VWs (probably what was keeping me awake in the first 
place) and I realized that in my personal experience the smaller the VW 
part : the larger the price.  Or maybe I should rephrase that as the 
whole is cheaper than the sum.  I'm babbling nonsense now, forget it.  
It's just that over the Summer I bought a '71 Westy for $50 with a mint 
interior and great engine and lots of other goodies (otherwise, it was 
toast) but I have to pay almost $40 for a dinky electric fuel pump to 
make my '73 go vroom!  I know there's a rationale here but I just can't 
grasp it.  It must mean more than getting a lucky deal.  Does anyone else 
have any thoughts on this?
