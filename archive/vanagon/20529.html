Subject: re: (sink) water pump ... I built one


I also had a broken water pump in my '81 Westy.
And was horrified at the high prices at the local 
RV dealers for pumps. So I did what I usually do 
in these situations, grabbed the J.C. Whitney 
catalog. Yes, J.C. Whitney to the rescue! They 
have a pump that fits right into the same spot, 
does the job beautifully, and the price is right 
too! It's in the RV section. Price is 16.95. Part 
number is 15BT8445B. They want a catalog number is
you order, this one is 579J. Phone number is
312-431-6102.
