hey guys!  Do any of you know where I might be able to get myself a used
motor for my '72 panel van?  Either a 1.7, 1.8, or 2.0 litre will be just
fine!  I would really like it to be carburated, but that is not TOTALLY
neccessary.  But the motor does need to be complete.  From the carburators
down to the alternator and the rear engine mounting bar.  The exhaust system
would be a big plus, but not neccessary.  I am even willing to doa rebuild as
long as the motor is in good structural condition (i.e. burning oil is okay,
but no thrown rods, etc. etc.)

I was dealing with this one guy that I was going to bu yhis motor from,  but
he all of a sudden stopped replying to my e-mails.  So i guess that his motor
is out of the question now.  Bummer.

If you know of a motor, please let me know.

You can either e-mail me or call me at (804) 275-7745 (Richmond, VA)

Thank you in advance.

Tim :)
