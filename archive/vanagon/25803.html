Subject: Re: Eberspacher Gas Heater parts source &amp; manuals

Hi folks,

Earlier this week I posted about a parts/manual source for Eberspacher
heaters. I called the 1-800 # I posted and inquired about parts for my old
BN4 model.  The receptionist offered me a manual and informed me that some
parts are still available.  Well, 3 manuals arrived today as well as some
literature identifying service/parts distributors throughout the U.S. and
Canada and some descriptions of the latest models.  The manuals cover the
post-71 version of the BN4 heater (the type with the metering fuel pump).
1-Technical Description and installation 2-Parts List 3-Troubleshooting and
repair.   The manuals cover many if not all of the same points as the manual
I previously had.  The one I had seems to be expressly tailored to VW
dealers as the instructions and pictures indicate installation and use in a
VW.  The latest manuals I received don't mention VW and I think were meant
for a broader audience.

Some other list members have called since my original posting.  Two I know
of were promised free manuals and I guess they should arrive within a week.
Jack Reed did mention to me that when he called the people he talked to
(including the manager) claimed they did not have any documentation and that
they had no parts for old heaters.  So I don't know if you'll get this
response, but I think it might be worth giving them a call.

If anyone is interested in finding out their local Espar service
center/distributor you can call 1-800-387-4800 for a listing.  Espar (the
U.S./Canadian division of Eberspacher) currently makes new heaters for
diesel and gas trucks, marine applications, and buses.  The basic designs
look similar to the heaters we have in our buses, however, I didn't receive
a price list on the new models and I would imagine they would be expensive.

I hope this info will be helpful to some of you as winter nears.

&gt;Well, last week I got a great lead on a parts source for Eberspacher
heaters.  &gt;When I first installed my BN4 my local dealer gave me some old
sales literature &gt;from a company called Espar products--the company that
originally imported &gt;these heaters and supplied parts to the dealer.  The
Canadian address on the &gt;literature was a dead end so I figured they were
out of business.  Last week I &gt;heard that Espar is still alive and kicking
and supplying new parts for our &gt;trusty companions.
&gt;
&gt;Their # is 1-800-387-4800.  When I called to inquire about a local
retailer, &gt;they gave me a few local suppliers in my area:
&gt;
&gt;Vermont:     PPD            802-644-6554
&gt;New York:    Cook Brothers  607-723-7481
&gt;New Jersey:  Edison         908-985-0331
&gt;
&gt;They also asked me if I wanted a free manual for my heater!  So I had them
send &gt;one.  When it arrives I'll compare it to the photocopied manual I've
been using &gt;and report to the list about any points of interest.
&gt;
&gt;A great day for gas heater do it yourselfers!
&gt;
