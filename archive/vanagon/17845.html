Volks,
	Here's a little summary of the electrical setup on my bus,
	in no particular order.

ALTERNATOR:

	Stock, 55 amp Bosch

BATTERIES:

	1.  Engine starting battery - 12V Die Hard Gold, right side of
	engine compartment.

	2.  12V Motocraft Deep-Cycle group 27, 150 mins reserve capacity.
	Mounted in left side of engine compartment.
	
	3.  12V Die Hard Gold Deep-Cycle group 27, 210 mins reserve 
	capacity.   Mounted in left side of engine compartment.

	4.  12V Sealed battery, 33 amp/hours.  Mounted behind drivers
	seat.
	(1) is wired directly to the alternator (as stock).
	(3) is wired in parallel with (2) and connected to (1) with 4 
	gauge cable via a (60-0-60) ammeter and a high-power relay.  
	I put a 60 amp household fuse at the ammeter.

AMMETER, FUSE BOX:

	The ammeter and fuse box are located in the rear drivers-side 
	closet, with the ammeter facing forward and visible from the
	outside.
	
BATTERY ISOLATOR RELAY:

	The relay is mounted in the engine compartment and operated by 
	a switch on the dash.  In order for the relay to be activated, the 
	ignition must be on *and* the dash switch must be on.  This way, 
	shutting the ignition off always isolates the starter battery 
	so it will not be drained accidentally by appliances while parked.  
	The relay is a silver canister that looks like a typical auto
	starter solenoid but is made to hold up under continuous duty.

ELECTRONICS CENTRAL:

	From the fuse box, two 8 gauge wires run up the drivers side to 
	the area right behind the drivers seat.  I left a 6&quot; deep
	area between the fridge and the back of the drivers seat for
	electrical stuff.  In this space I mounted the small battery (4),
	the power inverter, and two power distribution strips, one for
	hot and one for ground.  These strips have a row of spade
	terminals to make it easy to connect things.  In the 6&quot; wide 
	panel which covers this space, I mounted:

	Double 110V power receptacle
	Double pole double throw 15 amp switch to toggle the above
		receptacle between inverter and external 110V power
		source (for plugging in while camping)
	0-15VDC panel meter to monitor battery voltage
	0-8 amp meter and inline rectifier to monitor solar panel
		charge rate
	Double pole single throw 30 amp switch to turn on inverter.
	
SOLAR PANELS:

	The solar panels are two 1x4 foot panels, each of which puts
	out about 2 amps at 15 volts.  They are mounted in aluminum
	frames and bolted together side by side to make a single
	2x4 foot panel that puts out 4 amps at 15V (in peak sunlight).
	I drilled 5 holes in the fiberglass roof - one at each corner
	of the panel and one to run the wires through - and bolted the
	panels to the roof.  Rear two bolts have a .5&quot; rubber washer
	under the panel for cushioning.  The wires from the panels 
	run down behind the drivers seat to the electrical stuff area.
	
WHY THE 4TH BATTERY?

	As for the reason for the 4th battery behind the driver, it is
	because even with the two 8-gauge wires running from the rear,
	under a 60 amp load the voltage drops considerably.  Having
	a battery right near the inverter keeps the voltage higher
	for short term heavy current draw.  The extra capacity doesn't
	hurt either.  :)

INVERTER:

	Bought it from Damark.  It's a newer-tech inverter, only weighs
	6 pounds.  Has modified sine wave output which is sufficient to
	power most AC stuff.  600 watts continuous, 1000 watt surge.
	Brand is &quot;Power-to-go&quot;.  Has two status lights, automatic
	overload shutdown, two outlets.  I tested it a little and it
	works as advertised.  Runs a 25&quot; TV easily.  Runs 100 watt
	trouble light easily.  Runs power drill (rated 2.2 amps) easily.
	I was able to trip the overload circuit by plugging in both
	the trouble light and the drill, and then loading the drill 
	until it stopped.  Under this kind of load, I measured the drill
	as drawing 4.5 amps, so it seems as if the inverted does indeed
	cut out right about at 600 watts.  The inverter also has an
	internal cooling fan that is kind of noisy.  Seems like an
	intelligent fan though - it speeds up when the inverter is under
	load.  Tried plugging in the toaster which I measured at 7.1
	amps and it will not work at all.  Inverter shuts down after 
	about 1 second.  Comments on Damark:  I'm very impressed.  Sales
	people are friendly and their prices are good.  Never bought
	from them before, but I probably will again.

MICROWAVE:

	Not gonna happen, unfortunately.  I mistakenly thought that a
	&quot;500 watt&quot; microwave would draw around 5-600 watts.  Wrong.
	Tested one and it drew 9.2 amps or around 1100 watts.  What an
	inefficient beast!!  Called Damark - they had a 1500 watt inverter
	with 3,000 watt surge, but it was $449.  Little beyond my
	budget, and it would be too large a drain on the batteries
	(about 130 amps under full load!!!).

CB:
	Radio Shack 40 channel digital job.  Radio Shack gutter mount
	antenna.  Mounted the radio below the headlight switch and ran
	the antenna wire in through the drivers door.  Didn't drill
	anything, even though I should have.  Determined that there is
	no appreciable noise interference coming from the plugs/wires,
	but there IS a lot from the alternator.  Also, there was lots
	of background noise, which I thought was a problem, but once
	I drove out of town, it all went away.  So the city is the
	problem.  :)

FRIDGE:
	Norcold side-opening fridge - runs on 12VDC or 110VAC.  Compressor
	model (cools better than other kinds but is relatively noisy).
	External fan mounted up against a covered vent on the side of the 
	van to blow air over the coils, but it's not hooked up yet.  Gonna 
	wire it in so it only turns on when the fridge is running.  Inside
	the fridge is the battery operated fan that sits on the floor 
	and blows air upward.  Also bought a dual display digital temp
	gauge from Radio Shack and mounted it on the electrical panel
	next to the fridge.  Ran the sensor wire inside the fridge
	(temporarily through the front door along the seal) so that the
	&quot;outside&quot; temperature will = fridge temp.  Interior temp still =
	interior temp.
