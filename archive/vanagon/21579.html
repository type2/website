&gt;All of the candy thermometers are encased in glass casing which is
&gt;about 1/2 inch wide (of those that I saw), and would be too wide to
&gt;fit down the dipstick hole.
&gt;I saw some meat thermometers which looked great (would fit sizewise),
&gt;but alas they only go to 180 degrees or so.
&gt;Any suggestions?

what about one of those meat-cooking metal dial-on-the-end-of-a-spike type
... like you jab into a turkey to see if its goose is cooked. ;)

also check the chem lab at local schools or colleges. might be expensive,
but it should be stainless and able to take the heat.
