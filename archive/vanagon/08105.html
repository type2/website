&gt;Well per Joel's suggestion, I've started the search for the elusive
&gt;second oil pressure sensor on my 87 van.   Manual says the .9 Bar (~15
&gt;psi) sensor is mounted on the oil pump somewhere, and to access it by
&gt;&quot;pushing back the exhaust shield (screw on the bottom of the oil pump
&gt;body???)&quot;, but I'll be darned if I can find any obvious shield to push
&gt;back.   Maybe you need to drop the engine...
&gt;Anyone actually found this sensor on an 87?   Can you see it or the
&gt;wires without pushing back the shield I can't find?

yeah. lay on your back, under the car, and look at the oil filter. then
look up on the engine, kinda toward the middle of the car. it's around
in there. i think there's like one wire going to it (but i can't remember
what color). you might be able to see if from the top if you follow the
wires that come from the left side of the engine (over by the coil and that
black relay box).

&gt;Also, the manual seems to imply that the .9 Bar pressure sensor goes ON
&gt;at about 15 psi. so not clear why overpressure would be sensed
&gt;differently than normal pressure (Joel's theory).

i'm not real sure about this either (from the book), but what i kinda got out
of it was that the pushrod tube sender was the 'normal' one that we were all
used to (on the older air-cooled engines). and this oil-pump sender is some-
thing new ... for the Dynamic Super-Whoopee Oil Pressure Kludge, or whatever
that thing is called.

one of the sensors (if i read the book right) goes OFF when the pressure
reaches 'normal' range ... and the other one goes ON when pressure is too
high. but the gizmo circuitry (i think it said) detects if one of the sensors
never goes off/on. ???

let's see what we've got here: if the oil light goes on, then either
1. oil pressure is too high (by one sensor)
2. oil pressure is too low (by other sensor)
3. one or both sensors are defective
4. one or both sensors have bad electrical connections
5. electronics in dash are defective
6. electronics in dash have bad electrical connections

now, if the oil pressure light comes on ONLY when the rpm goes up and the
engine is COLD ... to me, that suggests high pressure (cold oil being
harder to flow than warm oil).  but just how the electronics is determining
that, i don't know.

do you suppose it's possible that the 2nd (low) sender is having a 'vacuum'
formed around it, with the cold oil?  maybe a cracked plastic electrical
connector on that sender?
