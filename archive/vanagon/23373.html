Subject:       german command car horn

my father-in-law has a horn from what he believes is a WWII German
command car.  there are no identifying marks but it is well made out
of chromium (?) plated brass. it is a squeeze-the-bulb type horn and
is VERY loud.  the rubber bulb is marked 'Avon' which doesn't suggest 
german origin... maybe the bulb was 'imported'?

anyone have any info on this?

VW content:  it would make a helluva classy horn on someones van!  i 
think it's louder than the VW electric ones.
