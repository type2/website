Subject:  Re: perception of EV reliability


&gt; &gt;I can't believe the reports I'm seeing of these problems with EVs.  It's
&gt; &gt;amazing to me that a vehicle that new has all kinds of expensive
&gt; &gt;problems.  Transmissions having to be dismantled, fuel injection, all kinds
&gt; &gt;of weirdness.  It's just not right!
&gt; 
&gt; Now wait a minute....

	My EV GL has 41K miles on her and I can report exactly zero
problems.  (Oh, wait a second.  The rear view mirror did fall off.  But I 
didn't use it anyway...And there was that rat, but that wasn't her fault and
she drove just fine without the belt.)  She has been the most reliable 
automobile I've ever owned.
