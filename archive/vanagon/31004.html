Subject: Re: Kick Panels

&gt;Hey Volks,
&gt;
&gt;I see lots of posts of people building their own kick panels.  I
&gt;attempted this using birch plywood, with partial success.  One
&gt;cracked, and the other one is OK, but could be better.
&gt;

You should have little trouble bending 1/8 inch Ply into the kick panels.
Make sure you buy high quality stuff, free of voids. APPLE ply is even
better, Ash venier over Maple core. I LIKE the wood look, but if you are
going to cover them, you could use 'wiggle board,' which is for laminate
substrate. It'll bend around just about any corner your likely to encounter
in a bus.
