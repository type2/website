Subject: RE:  Vanagon Engine Swap

Several years ago, when my first head gasket started to leak 
(fortunately at 125,000), I researched putting a different engine 
in my 84 Vanagon.  I contacted Kennedy Engineering as I'd had them 
make several &quot;one of&quot; adapters for previous conversions (example: 
Bedford Diesel in a M37).  They could only recommend the Subaru 
as a possible engine and allow the Vanagon to retain the same engine 
cover.  There is only 12&quot; between the engine centerline and the cover.
With the Subaru conversion, things would be pretty straightforward, 
except for the air cleaner adaptation.  For obvious reasons, Kennedy 
provides only major adapter parts, and they are not interested in 
providing complete kits.

The most viable engine conversion seems to be the rabbit direvations 
utilizing the Diesel Vanagon components.  Current prices from the 
&quot;Parts Place Inc. reveals the following:  NEW	       RECYCLED
	Diesel oil pump			154.95		 75.00
	Diesel oil pan			   -		100.00
	Engine mount			 93.35		 40.00
	Exhaust system			229,85		   -

I understand that there are several members of the list serve that have 
done this swap, but the details are missing.  I'd be willing to either 
work with someone that wants to do this swap - heck - you bring me your 
vehicle and either provide the components or the $ to purchase them and 
I'll do the swap and write up a technical manual with a list of 
components, suppliers, and step-by-step instructions.  (By way of 
background, I'm a modifier of 25 years standing - and I teach aircraft 
mechanics.)  One minor drawback from some individual's perspectives - 
I live in Fairbanks, Alaska.  Certainly not a drawback from my perspective.
