Subject: Ready to Cry Wolf: 91 Carat Wolfsburg Edition?

 I am curious to know about my new vanagon. Originally I thought is was a
Carat, which it is, but it also  has a Wolfsburg Edition medallion on it.
In a previous note a vanagon  owner mentioned that &quot;wolfsburgs&quot; were
&quot;lowered&quot; as in a chassis setup. Is this the case?  In asking around, the
only other item I could come up with is that somehow a Wolfsburg's paint
job was different?. Are there other items that might be inclusive of this
model.

I have a window sticker off another van that was Carat, so I'm up on the
Carat equipment.
