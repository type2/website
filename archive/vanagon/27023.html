Subject: Re: Heat while camping??

    I recently installed a propane forced air furnace in my EV, the 
furnace itself is about 9&quot;x9&quot;x22&quot; it is 12,000 btu and available from 
camping world.  I have taken this thing on extensive camping trips and 
it id outstanding, we were never cold.  There are no hot parts to burn 
babies.  The vent is about 3&quot;x7&quot; and chrome, It is exactly the heater 
found in the new winnebago EVs.
    Best of all if you already have propane it is a breeze to install 
asuming you have space.

&gt;David,
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for the info.  I took a look at Dave Garth's heater 
installation.  
&gt;It looks pretty good!!!  I think that is must be a catalytic heater, 
&gt;which, if I'm not mistaken, doesn't need a significant amount of 12 
volt 
&gt;power.  I was thinking of installing a catalytic heater, but I have a 
15 
&gt;month old, and I'm concerned that he might burn himself on an exposed 
&gt;heater like this.  The furnace that I'm talking about is a forced air 
&gt;heater, not unlike the gas heaters that some people have.  Also the 
&gt;outside vent on these things is about 3 inches wide by 7 inches tall.  

&gt;Seems like a relatively small hole in the side of the van.  At least 
it 
&gt;is not 9 inches by 9 inches.  The vent is also looks like a chrome 
plated 
&gt;die cast metal thing, not one of those cheap looking motor home vents. 
 
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for the response.
