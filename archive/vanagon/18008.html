Some westiphile hseaver_at_csd.uwm_dot_edu asked about roof racks for his netsurfwagen.
Here's what's worked for me.

I have installed Yakima &quot;Wide Body&quot; mounts on the sides of the fiberglass
and reinforced the mounting with backing plates on the inside.

Properly placed, these will allow the attachment of rain gutter style towers
and 66&quot; crossbars.  I mount a Thule Ski Box (Thule Combi 250) to handle
skis and things during the winter. 

If you don't want to use the &quot;wide body&quot; mounts the yakima tower extensions will
give a close fit between the roof and the crossbars but will work.  Mind you
you won't be able to pop the roof without removing the racks.

With the racks mounted to the pop up, and the equipment removed from the Thule
box you can raise the roof but it's a grunt.

As a sidelight, it's easy to park two bicycles inside and three more on the
rear of the vanagon using a wide body bolted to the roof hinge assembly to 
mount the crossbars/fork mounts.
