Subject: Re: Cheap alarm system...


Components for the phony 'Alarm Blinker' cost about $3, purchased quantity
one from Radio Shack or similar.

The one I made up, a quasi-schematic drawing of which was put on Dave
Schwarze's web page along with the photos of Grendel, uses a penlight drycell
as a power source rather than the vehicle's battery, as would a 'real' alarm
system.  The single dry cell will power the blinker for about a year of
continuous operation.
