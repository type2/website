&gt;&gt;&gt; To anyone German, please realize that I'm not making fun of you, I'm 
just
&gt;&gt;&gt; having fun.  Oh damn, I'm getting too PC.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It's a sad day when you gotta worry about sh*t like that.
&gt;
&gt;My last one, the Spanish one, got forwarded to somewhere and I received
&gt;a nasty flame from sombody who I've never seen post here, and who obviously
&gt;didn't understand the lightheartedness of my translations.
&gt;
&gt;I know I don't have to include the disclaimer for anybody here's sake,
&gt;but when these things get forwarded, it's possible for it to be seen
&gt;by someone who just doesn't know the relationship shared by our list,
&gt;and doesn't understand that you can poke fun at things without
&gt;putting them down.


Hey, bro, sit back and ice up a cold one. Why worry about the occasional
chronic whiner, when you know and everyone else knows you meant no harm
and are doing no harm? He's the one with the problem, not you, and he if
anyone should be the one apologizing for being a pain in the patoot.

My &quot;disclaimers&quot; tend to run like this:

&quot;The views expressed do not necessarily reflect the opinions of my
employer. If you think they did, you must be really out of touch.&quot;

   or...

&quot;The above is meant as light-hearted fictional entertainment, and is
not meant to reflect seriously upon any actual person or group. Did
you really think they did? Get a life!&quot;


I even occasionally get flames from those, but I don't mind-- it's a
blast to tweak such obvious attempts to create trouble where there is
none.

Keep smiling, stay sane, move forward, life goes on...
