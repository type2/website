Subject: tranny fluid and others

I changed the tranny fluid yesterday, and although the book said 7.4 pts, I 
put in less than 6 pts.  I drained out even less.  Does anyone have similar 
experiences or know for sure the real amount required?  I had it warmed up, 
and let it drain for a couple of hours.

One about timing.  I Muir's book in the hi-performance section (page 371), 
the author talks about &quot;total advance&quot; and he states that total advance 
should be around 32 degrees.  Is this the # of degrees BTDC with the 
distributor fully advanced?  When I was building the engine, I measured the 
advance that a 009 puts out, it is 28 degrees.  This means I am at 35.5 
degrees total advance.  Does any of this sound right?
