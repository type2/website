Subject: Re: 80 - 83? GAS TANK REPAIRS [longish

&gt; Since the sloshing stuff costs $20-30 and good fiberglass would be around
&gt; $10-20 for the supplies, im already in $40.00 anyway with no gurantee that
&gt; it would work at all. $69.95 stars to look like a bargain.

I don't think there is much, read than ANY chance in slosh repairing 
a Vanagon tank.  The fuel pickup is in that damn float with the two 
tubes attahced and will simply stick to the bottom.  PM is the key 
here, get to it before it's a problem.  Otherwise, well I got a fair 
one for free to anybody around the DC area needing one, only fair 
mind you, OK outside and I let it sit out in the rain one night so a 
faint haze of trivial surface rust inside, but I had cleaned it up and 
rustoleumed the exterior.  I gave up on it cause around here I could 
get a nice used one for $50, still probably can.  Something else I 
have this bizzare feeling that something in the float or it's filter 
screen itself may rust, hard to believe it would not be stainless 
though.

Oh one last thing, All this may only apply to later (84up) tanks if 
that is true sorry, my 81's had been replaced so I may never have 
seen a true early tank.
