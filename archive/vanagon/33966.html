I got this from the Porsche List.  Its from someone who got the CD and
was quite excited about it.  Now if we could get these for early air-cooled
VW's...  Have you emailed jonah_at_alldata_dot_com yet????

&gt; Subject: &lt;911 C-2&gt; - Alldata CD rom -- Technical Tips
&gt; 
&gt;      
&gt;      I have just purchased an Alldata CD rom, covering my 1991 C-2, but 
&gt;      only the Technical Tips portion, as I already own a full set of 
&gt;      factory maintenance manuals.  They told me that their manuals are 
&gt;      equivalent to the factory ones -- for which I paid $230!
&gt;      
&gt;      Wow !! Wow!! was I surprised and pleased with the content of this CD.  
&gt;      
&gt;      It covers &quot;everything you always wanted to know about your 911, but 
&gt;      the dealer would not tell you&quot;.
&gt;      
&gt;      I found topics such as:
&gt;                 How to fix the targa top -- stop the noises -- no one else  
&gt;                         had ever given me this type of info, and the dealer 
&gt;                         was totally unaware of these Porsche suggestions!!!
&gt;                 Battery discharging- and how to fix the drain -- also how   
&gt;                        long the battery will last if car is not driven.
&gt;                 Technical service manuals list available from Porsche
&gt;                 How to fix the muffler support bracket
&gt;                 List of recalls for the vehicle: Cruise linkage, blower     
&gt;                         resistor &amp; front screws.
&gt;                 Remove screw in &quot;trunk&quot; to prevent carpet chaffing.
&gt;                 Problems with the engine oil leaks - by engine SN.
&gt;                 How to change oil -- do not need to puncture the filter!
&gt;                 Wheels - what is OK and what is not.  
&gt;                 Etc, etc, etc.
&gt;      
&gt;      For the $30, I found this to be the best deal around.  I highly 
&gt;      recommend these to anyone who likes to take car of their car.  Besides 
&gt;      you can now talk knowledgeably with the dealer and the mechanics, and 
&gt;      get the right things corrected - some under warranty.
&gt;      
&gt;      Note that I have no knowledge of coverage of other vehicles, models 
&gt;      and years, but if the 1991 C-2 is an example, one cannot miss.
&gt;      
&gt;      I plan to order the same for my 633 and 300D. 
&gt;      
&gt;      PS:        I have no affiliation with Alldata whatever!!!
