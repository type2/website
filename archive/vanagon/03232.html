&gt; RIGHT ON!!!! I've driven T4s here and in Europe. In Germany T4s are
&gt; all over the place....in all varieties. I remember hearing how
&gt; &quot;breadloaves&quot; were not REAL VW vans in the late 60s...when the
&gt; &quot;bricks&quot; came out....Gaaawwwwddd!!!...they, too were not like
&gt; real Type 2s...
&gt; 
&gt; So in a sense, the T4-not-a-real-VW-van crap is nothing new!

Well, maybe.  I consider them to be a much further derivation from the original
than the vanagon was, because of the front mounted engine and front wheel drive.
Now why did they have to go and do that?  If they had put a water cooled inline
four horizontally (a la previa, I believe) in the back driving the rear wheels,
I think us purists (ahem!) would have taken to it a little better.  At least
there would have been something *major* to set it apart from other minivans, aside
from that little VW emblem...  :)
