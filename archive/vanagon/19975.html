Subject: FS: if you dont buy this you're nuts

1972 VW KARMANN GHIA COUPE
new black paint
new interior carpet, panels, console, rubber, etc
new clutch
no engine problems
euroblade bumpers (originals included in price)

I am sacrificing this ghia for 2500 dollars, it is worth much more!
The registration expires by saturday and if i have to send the DMV 30  bucks
to renew it and wait weeks to get it back I will be raising the price.  I will
give it away now for 2500 dollars, do not wait a minute.
I am in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania my phone # is  (610) 758-8412 call me if you
are interested (leave message if I am unavailable).

If you always wanted a ghia and you have 2500 dollars buy this one now or
regret it forever.
