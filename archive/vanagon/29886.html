&gt;The flat ones of course are ideal for an easy fit, but other than Porsche &amp;
&gt;VW, there's only Subaru.  Subaru has both flat 4s and flat 6es.  Their newest
&gt;4cyl is 2.5 liters and makes about 155HP.  I know, I know, it's not VW/Audi.
&gt; It's not German. It's not even European or American!  But, all thing
&gt;considered it might be the best alternative.  I think Syncros should be able
&gt;to live with 155HP.

Let me remind you guys about that technical article in the LiMBO newsletter
a few years back by that fellow in Canada who put a Subaru motor into his
Vanagon. We should contact him to see how it went.
