Subject: Kill switch/ignition idea


 I have this idea that I thought I'd shoot past all of you.
 
 What if I were to connect the coil wire from the ignition switch to the
 hot wire that leads from the fuse box up to the kill switch?  That way
 the key would work normally but I could flip the switch to prevent someone
 from starting the van.

           coil--------------------------------------kill switch
                                                      |
                fuse box(hot)-------------------------|
                      |                  |
                      |                  |
                      |                  |
                      hot                coil
                     (big red)           wire        
                      |                  | 
                      .......................
                      . ignition switch     .......starter............
                      .                     .......head lights........
                      ..............................dome lights........

 Would this work? or would I end up frying everything again?
