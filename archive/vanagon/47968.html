Subject: (fwd) FS: VW Vanagon--$750

&gt;From the net:

&gt; Sender: rhodis_at_elaine40.Stanford.EDU
&gt; 
&gt; For sale: 1980 VW Vanagon, Westfalia
&gt; 	
&gt; 	That's right, $750 dollars.
&gt; 	
&gt; 	Lots of miles (100K on odometer, driven for 8 out of 10 years
&gt; 	since the odometer broke in 1987)
&gt; 
&gt; 	Transmission work needed. Does not go except in reverse. To be
&gt; 	honest, I don't know what kind of work it needs. Worst case would
&gt; 	be a new tranny. I can't even afford to even have it looked at, so
&gt; 	this could be a bargain opportunity for you. I have lots of bills
&gt; 	to pay and can't give this car the attention it needs right now.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Strong motor, recent head work (December, driven sparingly since
&gt; 	April) and well maintained w/oil changes and such.
&gt; 	
&gt; 	New battery, Plenty of wear left on tires. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	NICE Kenwood detatchable face stereo w/Pioneer speakers also
&gt; 	available. I'd like to hold on to this, but it is currently
&gt; 	installed in the car, so something could be negotiated. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	This car has its share of idiosyncracies, but this is a soul car
&gt; 	and sleeps four. Camper = good times. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	I have two different roadside assistance plans, so I can probably 
&gt; 	get the car towed a reasonable distance from where it is in Palo Alto. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	Please reply by email
