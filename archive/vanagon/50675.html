Subject: Re: Help with stripped threads

Before you get case savers you may want to consider a heli-coil repair kit.
I don't remember how expensive they are, I know they ain't cheap. But if
you have an eight mm hole that is stripped the heli-coil tap will start
right in the stripped hole, no drilling necessary. Install the heli-coil
and you have a very perminent repair.

&gt;&lt;&lt;My current problem is one of the bolts I used to put the exhaust back

fixed, 
&gt;that will be the end of my van I'm sure of it.  What is the &quot;cheapest&quot; way
to 
&gt;fix this temporarily at least.  I don't care if the repair only lasts 6 
&gt;months, I have to do it myself.  Any suggestions (and prayers) would be 
&gt;greatly appreciated.&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Bryan,
&gt;
&gt;Get yourself some case-savers for a T1 upright motor. see what threads they 
&gt;are, they come in both metric and American threads, drill and tap the holes
&gt;in the head for the case savers, install them with a stud with two nuts or
&gt;a bolt, use the strongest loctite you van find. You'll end up with a proper, 
&gt;long lasting repair, you can screw the stock VW 8mm studs into the case 
&gt;savers.
&gt;
&gt;Brian.
