So Steve Jacksteit says:
&gt; Joel, et.al.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, take me off the Unknown section and place me in California with
&gt; a 1987 Vanagon, Wolfsburg Edition.  I'm a new, first time owner and

So where what city/town are you in?  Why?  So we can all converge on
your place and crash (not the literal meaning)  ;)

&gt; There's been quite a lot of dicussion about coolant and it seems
&gt; that the concensus is that non-phosphate coolant is desirable, if not
&gt; a must.  Is this a correct assessment?  A mention was made of some blue 
&gt; stuff from VW dealers.  Can color alone differentiate phosphate from 
&gt; non-phosphate? I have what appears to be the usual green stuff in my 
&gt; Vanagon now, I have no idea what brand it is.  Should I change this stuff out?  

My feeling is that if it says 'Autobahn' on it and it's blue, then
it's the right stuff.  If the colors different, I want a damn good
explanation from the dealer.

&gt; if anyone has experienced this problem and perhaps have a recommendation on 
&gt; what I should try first.

Echoing Tim's statement.  Check that pressure tank REAL good.  You may
have a defective cap or sensor, but check the amount of fluid first.
Otherwise, start looking the system over for leaks.
