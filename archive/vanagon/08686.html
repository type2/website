	Jim Meade,
	Before you remove and replace the switch, disconnect
the wires, and try making the various connections between them
that the switch should be making. In other words, check out the
rest of the system, on the presumption that the switch is really
at fault. If the fan, etc., work as you expect, then changing
for a new switch will probably fix it.

	Nobody around here does things like this, but you could
also check the switch after you remove it, using the proverbial
pan of boiling water and an ohm-meter or battery and light bulb
or what have you- it would be a trick to make sure the water
doesn't give you a false positive (conduction) but, at the
temperature of boiling water, the switch should be CLOSED, and
as it cools, should open.

	Good luck

	Merry Christmas, all!
