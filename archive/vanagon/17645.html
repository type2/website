&gt; &gt;And speaking of fixing things under the van, recently the noise level from the 
&gt; &gt;rear of the van has risen.  THere's a steady humming/whining noise coming from 
&gt; &gt;the back.  It seems to only happen while the engine is applying torque to the 
&gt; &gt;drivetrain -- if I back off the throttle it quiets down.  THe pitch does NOT 
&gt; &gt;alter when I shift gears, indicating it's not a &quot;gearbox&quot; problem, but in the 
&gt; &gt;final drive or axles/bearing.

I just replaced my wheel bearings after experiencing symptoms like you 
describe.  Do the light swerving thing as suggested: if sound 
changes/goes away under a certain load, this is more evidence of wheel 
bearings.  If you get grinding/crunching/sqeaking from the wheel(s), 
ditto for bearings.  Take this opportunity to get to know your CVJs 
anyway: drop the half-shafts and disassemble and clean 'em.  It'll buy 
you another 15,000 mi until you'll hAve to do it again, if nothing else.
