Subject: Parting Out 2 '63 Deluxe Buses &amp; More

Just bought 2 '63 Deluxe Microbuses from the original owner(!), to 
use as parts donors for my '63.  Too rusty to restore, but lots of 
nice stuff.  Also came with some '65-66 bus stuff.  Goodies include 
clocks, jailbars, solid gray seats, front deluxe bumper, glass, 
lots of body parts, interior stuff, etc. etc.  I would like to sell 
as much off of these busses as I can, and get rid of the carcasses 
within the next month or so, because I have nowhere to store them.  

If you need any pre-'67 bus stuff, send me a want list and when I 
go back on Monday I'll bring it along and see what I have.

-Ron Salmon

p.s.  One bus has almost a complete solid gray (not salt &amp; pepper) 
interior, including all of the seats except the 2/3 side of the 
front bench seat.  Does anyone have the one missing seat?  If I can 
find it, I'll keep the seats for my '63.
