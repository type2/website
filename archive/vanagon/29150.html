Subject: Re: Vanagon Sliding Door Problem

&gt;I have noticed a problem with the sliding door on my '87 Vanagon Camper. It
&gt;opens while I am driving sometimes (even when locked) and is hard to shut

Wow, lost anyone yet? Hey where's Mom?  There was a recall on my '85 slider
for the very same reason, maybe VW is recycling recall parts now :o  Tim Smith
