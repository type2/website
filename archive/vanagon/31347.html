&gt;I was looking at their catalog the other night, and the definately
&gt;discuss this conversion. I think one problem maybe the size of the
&gt;Mazda rotary engine if you want to keep from cutting some sheet metal:
&gt;the engine compartment size of a Vanagon is
&gt;much less than the Breadloafs'.


In the V6anagon, the &quot;floor&quot; above the engine is pretty low. The PO cut a
hole in the hatch and built a wooden box over the engine about 8&quot; higher
than the original floor.

But, from side to side, there is a ton of room for the Chevy 2800 V6
that's in there now. So much so that I'm thinking about mounting the
radiator sideways back thee with a cooling fan, instead of up front as
it now is.
