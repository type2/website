Subject:      Re:  2nd battery . . . deep cycle?



Seems the word I've gotten is go for the deep cycle to run accessories. I
haven't had a chance to do so yet but am also curious as to others
experiences. I noticed that camping world sells a single battery that is two
batteries in one, a deep cycle and high amp--for posts. This may be the way to
go if I ever get another gas heater.
