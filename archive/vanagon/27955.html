Subject: Fwd: FOR SALE: 15-Inch Alloy Wheels for Benz

    Was someone looking for some 15&quot; wheels?  I seem to recall that MBZ 
wheels would work.

I have four 15x7 original M-B alloy wheels from a 1986 300E. The Wheels 
are in 
good shape, but could use glass-beading/painting. They are shod with 
some cheap 
radial tires (the brand is Mastercraft). Tires are in good shape. 
Wheels are in 
Seattle, WA. If anyone is interested in purchasing them, please make an 
offer 
(including shipping). Thanks.
