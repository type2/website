This may be old news.  In &quot;Endless Summer II,&quot; when the boys are 
traveling the South African coast, they do it in a Syncro.  There are 
some pretty cool scenes of the van barreling down dirt roads and wheeling 
through some sand dunes.  You know, seeing a Syncro is the only time I 
wish I had another vehicle (Sorry Kermit).
