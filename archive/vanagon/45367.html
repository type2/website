No.
 
&gt; 0 301 353 -  ~ early sept 63
&gt; 
&gt; 0 590 821 -  ~ early june 64
&gt; 
&gt; what is your chassis number?

1165853   (Sept. '63 is on the plate)

&gt; hope this helps

It sure does!  So, if the leading zero is the seventh (or first) digit, 
then this motor is (and the original was) a 40 HP?  I thought that the 
'64 USA imports were 1500 standard?

Thanks again!

Bob
