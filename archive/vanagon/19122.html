Subject: Vanagon louvered side windows?
Date: Sun, 11 Jun 1995 10:41:53 -0700

When I had my 76 Kombi (I still miss it) I went to my local dealer
and bought louvered side windows, and installed them. Louvered windows
are windows that look like:
         partly   fully
 closed   open    opened
  |        \        _
  |        \        _
  |        \        _
  |        \        _

Well, when I got my 90 Vanagon, I went to my dealer and he said they
no longer exist, I even made him prove it by showing me the parts fiche.

BUT, last summer I was in Glacer National Park and I saw saw a German
Vanagaon (ie. German license plates) that had them installed. I waited
around for the owner and talked to him. Regrettably his english wasn't
very good, all I managed to get was that these were available in
Germany, probally an aftermarket part.

Well, I want to get a pair, any ideas are appreciated on where I can
find them.
