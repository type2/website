Subject: bus archives?

We have our incredible archives to search thanks to Gerry but what about the
bus, er...air-cooled list. That bob guy and others who went to the air
cooled list have a lot of incredible information we may wish to access at
some time in the future. 

Is there an archive for the busses as well, or do I have to subscribe and
create a local archive for bus list on my own hard drive (1.3 megs notebook,
already full!)?
