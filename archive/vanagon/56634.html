Subject: Whiff of polyglycol
Date: Fri, 28 Feb 1997 08:19:41 -0700

Help!  I know there has been a lot on this, but my '90 Carat with 107K
on it is sending me a whiff of polyglycol (antifreeze smell) when I turn
left?  Heads were done by dealer two years ago at 55000.  Think I am
looking at that again?  Also, if so, would this be the time for a
rebuilt engine, or do I need to do some checking first?  Thanks in
advance, and happy Friday.
