&gt; &gt;Just because I refuse to travel in the
&gt; &gt;&gt;USA 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Why would you refuse to travel in the USA?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;

&gt; Leo,
&gt; I have nothing against America.  As a matter of fact I 
&gt; spent ten days in San Jose a couple of months ago.  
&gt; However, since I live in the third largest country in
&gt; the world (USA is fourth) that has a very small 

Make that Canada is the second largest (Russia is still #1)

US is #3

&gt; population ratio compared to size.  Canada has an
&gt; excellent infrastructure, amazing scenery, polite
&gt; reasonably well educated population, and sadly; the
&gt; much under utilized Trans Canada Highway.  
&gt; It makes no sense to travel in the US when my money
&gt; doesn't go far, there are too many people, and no
&gt; under explored scenic areas.  It may seem to be a 
&gt; cheap nationalistic sentiment, but if I'm going to travel
&gt; over 6000 miles in the bus;  I'd rather do it here.  --Ralf
