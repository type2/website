&gt;Look everyone, Jim's back, anybody get a catalog yet to this day?

Bus Boys took my check for the catalog, but so far ... nothing. On the other
hand, West Coast Metric sent me a nice catalog and I'm waiting for a second
shipment from them. Amazing how much more business I give to companies who
let me know which items they have to sell.
