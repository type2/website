Subject: Sliding door fix. Help!

My 1985 Vanagon sliding door does'nt always shut or then sometimes it  pops
open. (not past the safety catch).  There was a recall for this problem, but
my van has already gone through this fix.  (and VWoA told me they won't do
it again for free).  Could someone tell me what needs to be replaced and the
proceedure.

Thanks,

Bill Lund
