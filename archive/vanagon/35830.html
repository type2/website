Yep, did that with my old BMW 320i a few years ago.  Made me wish I hadn't been 
so cheap and lazy to not want to walk the 1 block to the auto parts store.  It 
din't get me in the face but I soaked a T-shirt.  It's not that I was caught 
completely off guard, it was just that I wasn't able to jam it in without having 
some part of my body directly under it.
