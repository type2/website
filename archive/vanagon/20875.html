Subject: Re: Sliding door lock...

In a message dated 95-07-14 10:27:50 EDT, you write:

&gt;&gt; Does anybody know how to fix the sliding door lock on an 82 vanagon? In 
&gt;&gt; my van (name: turtle, what else could you call a diesel westy), the 
&gt;&gt; little knob on the inside that locks the sliding door does not stay in 
&gt;&gt; the &quot;open&quot; position any more. To open the door you have to either push 
&gt;&gt; the knob up (from the inside) or keep the key turned (from the outside). 
&gt;&gt; It seems like a spring or something is missing. 
&gt;&gt; Does anybody know how to remove the door panel in order to get to the
lock?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Many thanks, 
&gt;&gt; Joerg
&gt;
&gt;I've got the same problem on my '82. I looked into it once, and reached the 
&gt;conclusion that you need to remove the inside door panel. This looks like a 
&gt;major PITA since the plastic fasteners that hold the door panel on seem like

&gt;they'll break and need to be replaced when you pry them off.
&gt;
&gt;Anybody have any luck with this operation?

I thought those plastic fasteners would brake also, but they didn't!  Just be
sure to pull straight out and don't do it in cold weather (HA!).
I've had to remove the panel on the drivers door many times (problem with the
window) and not one fastener has broken.
