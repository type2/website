&gt; Where can I get a copy of this book?
&gt; What year was it printed and by whom?
&gt; 
Bob Hoover is a member of this listserv who knows an awful lot about 
Volkswagens and is kind enough to share his knowledge with us.  He as 
written quite a few &quot;sermons&quot; on building and repairing VWs.  I'm sure 
someone else on this list will point you in the right direction.  The 
sermons are available somewhere (I forget where).  I have them saved to 
disk and could send them to you if you like (huge file).

I'm not sure who wrote How to Hot Rod Your VW but I'll look it up 
tomorrow at work and send you the info.  You might want to look at How to 
Rebuild Your Volkswagen Air-Cooled Engine by Tom Wilson.  Published by HP 
Books.  My editon is 1987.  I do know that Classic Motorbooks carries 
that title.  They probably carry the other one also.  I don't have their 
number handy but you could call 800 directory assistance at 
1-800-555-1212.  Hope this helps!
