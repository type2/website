Yes, however, your biggest problem would be driving it home after
it got shipped to a local port, since (in the US) the EPA, DOT, etc.
might have something to say about whether or not your spiffy TDI
met emissions req'ts, or not.  You could, of course, make the re-
quisite modifications so it'd be legal to drive here, but it usually
costs $$$.  It almost seems better to look for a salvage motor, and
put it into the recipient of your choice; at least then you should
only need to make sure that the emmisions testing is appropriate for
the newer of either the motor or the vehicle.

Or perhaps you'd like to join the military/diplomatic corp and get
posted on the other side of the pond...  :)
