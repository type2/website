Subject: Make those backup lights bright
Date: Mon, 8 Aug 94 9:49:32 PDT

I have this fantasy that perhaps there is a halogen or other very bright bulb
with say 2 to 3 times the light output of the stock bulb to put in the back-
up light socket.  I really don't want to mount additional lights but I really need more illumination.  Any ideas?
