Hi Everyone!,
My Alternator/BAttery led indicator seems to be coming on ( slight dim)
not as bright as the LED on the right of my 84 GL. Changing the load
e.g switching on high beam, AC , etc does not seem to change the
brightness. I am suspecting a short or a defective voltage regulator.
Anybody have any ideas whats happening ? Thanks
