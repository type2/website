Subject: Re: Sticky clutch (fwd)

&gt;This is a message I got from a friend of mine regarding the clutch on his 
&gt;'77 Westphalia bus. Since I don't know enought about ti yet, I thought 
&gt;maybe somebody from the list has a clue/hint. Thanks a lot.

&gt;I wonder if anyone has had this problem:
&gt;
&gt;In the morning, when I start my '77 camper in gear with the clutch 
&gt;depressed, the vehicle surges forward. After that, it used to be fine 
&gt;while driving....Now, though, I'm having problems getting it through the 
&gt;gears all the time.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Could there be gunk from a broken seal fouling up my clutch plate ??? Is 
&gt;there anything I can test without removing the engine ??? (BTW, I'm 
&gt;pretty sure my clutch cable is properly adjusted.)
&gt;

could be the PILOT BEARING, it causes these symptoms when it fails.
the fix is to drop the trans. not the engine. It's &lt;$10 part, and you
get to put in a fresh clutch disc if needed.



&gt;Help before I drop the engine !!!!!! (or tell me what to look for when 
&gt;it's out....)
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
