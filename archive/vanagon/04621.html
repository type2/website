It is romantic but not too meaningful to say that your brother's 72 has a 914
engine in it as that is the factory set up. You could say that all 72-79
busses have 914 engines in them since the engine is virtually identical
between the two cars. 

Unfortunately, it is probably more correct to say that the 914s have little
VW motors in them. 

The 914 in europe was sold with a VW badge on it instead of a Porcshe badge.
