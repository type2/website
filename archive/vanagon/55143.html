&gt;he has a Mazda RX-7 he's selling for $500.  Obviously, it has the Wankel rotary
&gt;engine. I know Kennedy makes an adapter to use this engine in the Beetle (I'm
&gt;serious!) so I'm sure they make an adapter to put it in the Vanagon. 

they do, comments are it winds to high in vanagon trans, needs re-gearing,
gives bad mileage, but sounds and looks great.  Now if this was the newer
RX-7 twin turbo.... Tim
