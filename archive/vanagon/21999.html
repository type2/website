Subject: Seattle to Texas

Hi,

I just bought a '72 Westy and I am thinking about a trip to Texas from
Seattle.  I would like any advice about camping on the road and not getting
arrested for loitering.  I was also wondering if anybody has a good list of
emergency items that a bus might consume on a trip across the rockies. I am
also looking for a book that might make repairs on the side of the road
easier.

If you are between Seattle and Texas waive when I go by,
