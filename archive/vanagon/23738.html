&gt; After that I may add a front &amp; rear sway bar kit. 
&gt; 
&gt; Does the vanagon collective have any advice in this area?
&gt; 
Along this question, does anyone make upgraded anti-roll
bars anymore period, I recall a company Libra Automotive
who was selling a bigger front bar and a rear bar in the
late 80's but they long since went out of business.  Does
Sway-away have a rear bar and bigger front bar? and if
so do they work? How about JC Whitless stuff, I think they
say they got em.  I drove our '76 on cheapo car tires for
a few years and don't care, but mom and dad are about to start
driving the '77 and both have not driven a Bus in 7 or 8 years
and not even a Vanagon in 3 or 4 so I want the transition
from a modern nicely handling vehicle (Passat) to be as
gentle as it can be all things considered.  I'm hoping new
C or D rated tires, maybe a bit wider (195/75's) and new gas
shocks with a rear anti-roll bar added will make the camper
handle better than new.  Also what shocks would be best with
such a setup?, or generally how does one make a bay window
handle as well as it can, for say $500 or so?  Primarily
I want to eliminate that terrifying sway induced by crosswinds
and that left and right thing induced by an 18 wheeler wake
as much as I can for them.
