&gt;&gt; BTW, while we're talking about wierd combinations, did you see the picture
&gt;&gt; of a '63 bus with a sliding door in V*lksw*rld a while ago. At least I think
&gt;&gt; it was a '63, it was definitely earlier than '67 when these were supposed to
&gt;&gt; be first available.
&gt;
&gt;Nope, '63 was the first year.

Well, that'll teach me to believe something I read in Volksworld. 

What came over me? Probably a meat pie :)
