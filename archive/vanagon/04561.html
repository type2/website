Subject: Esp For Eurovan Owners, Tires

Ric, in particular, and the others.

Tried sending a message and there was lightning outside. Seems all my 
messages were trashed (I guess I learned a lesson here). Sorry for the 
garbage you received.

I'm re-transmitting ...

I have the original Goodyear tires on the EV. I have approx 28,200 miles 
on them and I try to rotate as near to 5,000 miles as possible.

The last trip was about 6,500 miles. I rotated the tires just before the 
trip.

The term &quot;cupping&quot; was exactly what the service person at the VW dealer 
used to describe what was happening.

Not being even a &quot;backyard&quot; mechanic, I did not know what the term meant 
nor how significant it is.

In layman's (uh, layperson's, sorry Martha) terms ...

There is a very obvious (can be seen and felt with the hand) uneven wear 
all over the road-surface of the tires. There are surface areas where the 
tread depth is much less than in a segment immediately preceeding or 
following in the same linear path.  Adjacent treads show a similar 
pattern but not in any consistent arrangement. There are small cracks 
where the sidewalls join the tread.

When I rotated the tires, the ones from the back (now on the front) 
really made a difference in driving and handling. I had the tires replace 
like they were on the trip.

It's Sunday morning and I'll take the EV back to the dealer this evening 
so they can get an early start on it (I hope) on Monday.  Will keep all 
interested informed.

Any and all comments are welcome!
