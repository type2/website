Subject: Mystery Machine back on road...

	Well I picked up the beast this morning, and tried to get the guy
at the shop to explain what they did to get the fuel mixture back down to
where it was supposed to be. Now, I realized it was early in the morning,
and they had just opened, but this guy just explained how they had tested
everything, and replaced a couple wire connectors and such, but gave no
definative answer as to the solution. Very frustrating.
	They have not charged me yet, as they want me to take it out for a
good ride, and see if everything stays tickety-boo. Hopefully it
will....no..not hopefully, I pray, that everything is ok. The thought of
spending every last dime I've earned for this trip on gas makes me shudder.
(I just shuddered).
	On a VERY distutbing and aggravating note: When the shop guy took
me out into the yard to explain and point out some of the things they had
tried to fiddle with, I noticed somehting on the back hatch of the van just
before he lifted it open. There was a huge dent/scratch that was definetly
not there before. I think I would have noticed a huge gouge and paint
flakes coming off as if it were snow. He said he'd ,mention it to his
superior and try to remedy the situation. I most defintely think so. There
is no way they're gonna bend me over on this one.
	Anyhow, thats my morning rant.....now I get to sit here all day
thinking about what they're gonna do about the dent, and pray that the
mixture stays where it should.

is this wednesday or a bad monday????
