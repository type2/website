Subject: Re: oil temp?

Judging from what Joel wrote on oil temps, the ideal temp is between 190
and 220 F,but Bergmann sells an oil cooler switch/fan that is designed to
come on at 180F to keep the temp there so there is clearly a discrepancy
in what is deemed optimal running temp. Two other things: if it is true
that higher temps cause oil to breakdown (and perhaps under severe
conditions break down quickly) then it makes sense to go to synthetic;
the tradeoff here is that synthetics do not absorb as much heat as dino
oil and so transfer it to the engine (or so the theory goes). I am running
synthetic and have noticed a slight increase in engine temp (around 10-15F)
but cannot say for sure this is caused by the synthetic. The other point is
that as oil temps increase, pressure also drops and many of us have
experienced that viscious cycle when going up a long hill when the oil
heats up, presssure drops, engine runs hot, and the oil heats up more
and the pressure drops even further until we are forced to run at a crawl
in first gear just to keep the revs up. One of the cheapest soltions is to
use 20w50 at all but the coldes temps....DC
