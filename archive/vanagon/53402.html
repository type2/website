Subject: '85 Wouldn't start -- suggestions


I was driving home from school yesterday. It was a nice long drive across
all of Eastern Washington on unsanded snow and Ice the whole way. The van
did fine the whole way over. It never missed a beat...but over on the wast
side of the mountains after about 7 hours of driving 60 or so, I stopped
at a store.  I came out and tried to start it. It turned over just fine,
but wouldn't start. It didnt' even try to catch. I tried for about 15
minutes, giving it long breaks between starting and still nothing. I
stopped trying bought a paper, and tried again in 30 minutes...still
nothing.

I was tired and I had already missed the last ferry to go home, so I just
rolled to the other side of the lot and slept there for the night. 

Thenext morning It started right up wihtout any problems. It did run a
little rough for a miute, but ran just fine otherwise. I caught the ferry
and made it home no problem.

Has anybody else experienced somethign like this...it has plenty of
battery, but wont even think of starting? Any suggestions on things to
check out?

Thanks
Aaron Robinson
