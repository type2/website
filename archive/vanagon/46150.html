Subject: VW credit card

Got a call over the weekend from MBNA and accepted a credit card that builds
toward a $3,500 potential rebate on a VW product. Normally I blow these
things off but since the &quot;new beetle&quot; might be a real car, and Lord knows I
charge enough, and I happen to have a newly teen-aged daughter, I thought
that possibly all these threads might converge a few years hence.
