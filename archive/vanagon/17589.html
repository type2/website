Subject: listserv move

I will be doing some major changes to the machine that runs the listserv 
very soon.  Some implications of the changes will be:
  1. Very likely the ftp and gopher sites will be down for a day.
  2. I will keep the listserv running through it all.

I'm shooting for thursday and will confirm when it's final.
