Subject: Re: Sighting: VW powered Jeep CJ-5

        There was one of these for sale at last summer's Bug-Out in Milan,
Michigan.  I took a couple of pictures of it... they're in my pile of &quot;ooh,
scan *these* next!&quot; photos so I'll pop 'em up on a temp web page for folks
to have a look at.  The fellow who was selling it said that they were done
by a company somewhere in western Michigan.
