Subject: West Coast Trip - stores nearby


Here is an excerpt from my trail guide book:

[being quote]

In the 1.3-mile stretch of Highway 1 north of the park's north
boundary, which is 0.5 mile north of the entrance road, there are
additional services and lodging. From south to north, these are:
Fernwood Resort (campground, motel, gasoline, groceries, dining room),
Glen Oaks Motel and Restaurant, Ripplewood Resort (cottages, store,
gasoline), Riverside Campground and Cabins, Big Sur Campground and
Cabins, and River Inn (motel, store, gasoline).

Just 1.5 miles south of the park's entrance road is the big Sur Post
Office, and about 0.1 mile beyond it is Begonia Gardens, a tourist
attraction with gas pumps. About 0.6 mile beyond it, only 0.1 mile
before Highway 1's summit, is the entrance to deluxe Ventana
Inn. About 0.6 mile past the summit is Nepenthe, which servers lunches
and dinners from from an ocean-view terrace (they claim you can see 40
miles of coastline, but fog usually prevails). Finally, 0.7 mile past
Nepenthe is Deetjen's Big Sur Inn, which has lodging and serves
breakfast and dinner.

[end quote]

Unfortunately I have no good data on where to obtain fresh
fish. Carmel should work, but then you must ice it for the 30 miles to
the campgrounds.

I have done about 4 hikes into the Ventana Wilderness and love the
area, but it do kick the butt. I have 3 uuencoded wide angle gifs of
the area if anyone would like to see what it is like...one includes
quite a stretch of hiway 1. They are about 240K each. Reply by email
if you want to see.
