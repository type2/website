&gt; I'm having a Vanagon I'm interested in checked out and the mechanic says

gas
&gt;  leak.
&gt;  Has anyone heard of this? The mechanic says it is a 3-hr job to fix.
&gt;  

My first question is what EXACTLY is it he is going to fix?  Is it a leak in
the tank itself (doubtful), a hose, the reserviors, the t connector (isn't
there a recall on this?), etc....  What are the syptioms you are having?
