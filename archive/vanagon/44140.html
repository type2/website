Subject: Re: Found a Binz Crewcab

My brother-in-law and I had an on going joke amoungst ourselves at the
VW-Classic. We kept hearing that the Binz Double was a rare vehicle but
everytime we turned our head there was another Binz~! We understood that
there were only roughly 750 Binzes ever &quot;made.&quot; This number could be off (I
don't care) but we laughed that all 750 must have been at the show. We also
noticed that there were no '54 ovals at the show. That made us wonder which
is more rare in todays market. Inquiring minds get whacky on certain road
trips- especially when the wives are at home.
