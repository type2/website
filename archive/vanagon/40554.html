Subject: Re: red rock (Found the map~DOH!)

&gt;It looks like mystery VanBondo family may com out of hiding for the Red
&gt;Rocks fling.
(Now where DID I put that atlas...? )

DOH!!! Found the atlas. WOW now I know why they call them Camping Crazies.
This is going to be one heck of a drive for a two day weekend from Phoenix.
Does anyone know how long it takes to get to Red Rock from San Bernadino?
Would it be better to go from Barstow to Tehachapi via Mojave and then
north? or Barstow, Johannesburg and down. The second route looks longer on
the map.
Having my doubts...
