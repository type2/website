Subject: oil cooler installed !!!!

I bought an oil cooler at a garage sale for $2.00 a week ago. I was going to
drill a hole in the side of my bus but clara (claralw_at_aol_dot_com) came up with a
brillianr suggestion. I fed the oil hoses through the vent in my 70
westphalia. There was one minor problem, the hose to the external oil cooler
is one size smaller than the oil cooler connections, but I managed to get it
all together. It certainly is a wonderfully bodged job with the hoses visible
in the drivers side rear mirror, going into the air intake. I took a test
drive and there were no leaks. I used to run at 250F regularly now it runs
about 15 degrees cooler, not as cool as I would like. I think that I need to
turn thr cooler sideways so that it has nore airflow, but noe it will stick
out 8 inches instead of 4. Well I drive to work tomorrow and will see what 20
miles on the freeway do.

Has anyone mounted an oil cooler under the body on top of the transmission?
That may be better and I have another oil cooler.

PS a bodger is a jack of all trades who makes do with string and sealing wax,
or in modern times duck tape!!!!
