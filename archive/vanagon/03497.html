Subject:      new vw/winnebago campers

oh, yeah. :) i forgot the punch line:

the whole point is that
(1) half-size town has winnebago dealer.
    full-size armpit has none.
(2) half-size dealer has three.
    full-size armpit vw dealer can't even spell 'camper'.
    hell, full-size armpit vw dealer has only six vw's on the whole lot!
