&gt; &gt;&gt; buses.  well, that's what it says anyway. i never heard of a 74 bus with
&gt; &gt;&gt; fuel injection, much less a 2.0 liter engine, but that's what the catalog
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;or not, but for a long time I thought fuel injection was implemented
&gt; &gt;mid-year in `74 (since my `74 doesn't have it).  He did have a 1.8
&gt; &gt;liter engine, though.  Could it be that he had a `75 and didn't know
&gt; 
&gt; i guess so. all my previous info said that the 74 was carbs and the 75 was
&gt; fuel injected and BOTH had an 1800cc engine. but the bosch book says 74 had
&gt; fuel injection and a 1970cc engine. :)  since it seems they listed ALL of
&gt; the 1979-1974 buses as having that same size engine, i guess it's just a
&gt; screw-up in their catalog. :)

Late buses for '74 had fuel injection.  I'm not sure which month they changed
but I'm sure it was the later half of the year.
