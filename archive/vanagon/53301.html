Subject: Bug List Server,  Draining batteries &amp; Blue


Drove a '69 Bug home last nite &amp; will winter
store it for &quot;the sweetie&quot;. Shit-- I drove one of
those tin coffins thousands of miles in the late
70's -- actually got it up to 97 mph!!! Sobriety
provides an entirely new perspective.

Hoping that Tara will trust me enough to allow
me to put platinum plugs and  synthetic oil in
her Bug and do the valve adjustments!!! That
will be the true test of our relationship.

The guy who sold the Bug (Dr Herbert Goltz)
was telling stories about his first '54 Bus with
23 windows; doing the German-English &amp;
English-German translation during his
Wolfsberg factory tour when the VW translator
missed a day at work and he was picking up a
new '65 Bug; and, seeing a Bus dropped 6 feet
during ship-side loading.

Does anyone have the dope on a BUG list
server?

In &quot;Keeping your VW Alive&quot;  Muir or Tosh says
to drain the battery for storage. Any advice or
instruction?  

Any advice on the colour blue? The colour of
the Bug is a blue that has been called:

&quot;Florida Blue&quot; by the previous owner based on
what the body shop told him;

&quot;Robin Egg Blue&quot; by VW mechanic Gunther
Luddeke; and

&quot;Bahama Blue&quot; in a model catalogue selling
metallic scale Bugs. 


Regards

Dino

PS 

I settled on  &quot;Rust Check&quot; for the '89 Westie
Syncro despite the history of Ziebart use by
previous owner..
