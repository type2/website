&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; I have yet to turn up definitive proof that VW actually recalled the
&gt; digifant ECU's.
&gt; 
&gt; I've confirmed that VW did revise the digifant several times throughout
&gt; each production year and that all Vanagon Digifant ECU's are
&gt; interchangeable. The difference being that each later model is presumably
&gt; better.
&gt; 
&gt; So, if anybody actually has a VW recall number, PLEASE POST IT!
&gt; 
&gt; I've searched the archives and found lots of info, lots of numbers, but no
&gt; official VW recall number.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the time and help!

&gt; 
&gt; btw - I ended up buying a used ECU from a '90 for $200, haven't gotten it
&gt; in the mail yet.
