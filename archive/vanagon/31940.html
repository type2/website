Subject: Re: /f Observations on Calif.


&gt;The only question is, how can I *afford* to go bus-hunting outside the
&gt;rust belt?  Let's say I do get out to SoCal somehow and see lots of
&gt;great busses.  How do I convince someone to sell me one?

Same way as always:  bring money.   :^)

Or, if you can get a list member to check one out that's near his home,
and it sounds good to you, call the owner direct and mail him a deposit.
Stipulate that the car must be in the condition he has described, etc.
Sure, you're taking a chance, but what else is new in the used-car biz?


&gt;How can I
&gt;afford 2 weeks in a hotel, and 2 weeks off work?

Depending on the condition of bus you're looking for, it can be as little
as one day for one in decent running shape. But then you'll have a five-
day drive back to the east coast, unless you can do extensive night
driving (which personally I can't). And that's IF your newly-acquired
20-plus-year-old VW doesn't break down on the way back. Hint: bring lotsa
tools and your AAA card. If you don't have one, get one.

As an example, about a month ago, I flew from San Diego to Springfield, MO
to buy an '80 Vanagon with a Chevy V6 engine in it, and with a few problems
with the rack-and-pinion and the fuel pump. A kind list member met me at
the airport, brought me to the bus, chauffered me around, and wound up
putting me up on his couch for a night (far beyond the call of duty!!!).
I worked on the bus for about half a day, and then drove it 1600 miles back
to San Diego in 2-1/2 days. Overall a very satisfactory outcome.

On the other hand, for an example of someone who acquired a bus a long
way away, which was said to be in &quot;good condition&quot; but wasn't, send some
Email to Bob Hoover (veeduber_at_aol_dot_com) and ask him about Grendel. His saga
will curl your hair.

Several other people on this list have done this sort of thing recently.
Anyone else have any stories to tell?


&gt;Someone want to put me up in their house (no joke, very serious)?

Sure-- let me know when you're coming. Hope you like hideabeds.


&gt;is there one or maybe two
&gt;weekly sale papers in SoCal that most everyone recognizes as the &quot;most
&gt;comprehensive&quot; list of cars for sale in the state?

The &quot;Recycler&quot; is far and away the best paper listing of ads for stuff
for sale in SoCal. Dishwashers, pets, tools, computers, houses, you name 
it--
and, of course, cars. Each issue has literally hundreds of cars for sale,
with a good representation of older (and newer) VWs. Cars are divided up
by year, and by make within each year.

Each major area has its own edition. Some overlap, but if you get the Los
Angeles Recycler, the Orange County Recycler, the Inland Empire Recycler,
and the San Diego Recycler, you'll pretty much cover the spread, with
little overlap. And you'll have more old-VW ads than you know what to do 
with,
ranging from nonrunning project cars to pristine showroom restorations--
and a lot of daily drivers in between, most of which won't have much rust
(knock on wood). All of these editions come out once a week, usually on
Thursdays I think.


&gt;Can I buy a subscription?

Yup. Call 213-660-8900, and they'll be happy to take your money.

I don't know what delivery options they offer, but if you're serious about
buying a car this way, ask for the fastest delivery they offer, overnight
or two-day if possible. Good VWs tend to get snapped up fairly quickly.
Keep your bags packed!

Good luck,
