Subject:      Eberspa:cher Typ BN 4   gas-heater

does anyone have an English-language copy of the instructions/owner's
manual for this type of gas-heater? i've got one in German (thanks to
Forrest Minor) and before i ask if anyone wants to try to translate the
four pages, i thought i'd see if anyone has the English version already.

i don't see a date on it, but at the bottom of the pages are:

92072 R 3392    eberspa:cher  A 22 25 27 28


if no english is found, who wants to take a shot at the German? :)  so i can
type it up and put it with the original.  (i'd dump it to the list, but most
of us wouldn't be able to do anything with it ... so i thought i'd ask for a
suc...er, volunteer. yeah, that's it!). :)
