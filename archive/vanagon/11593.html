Subject: '90 better than '86?

There is an opportunity to trade from my trusty '86 to a '90 Westy. I 
can't see that much difference, but I haven't explored it very carefully 
yet - does anyone know if it is worth the change for any upgrades, etc 
that were added in the last 5 years of the Vanagon's life?
- Jack
