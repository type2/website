Camping in rest stops is not advised.  My recently retired father 
police type says they are pretty high crime areas.  I stay out of them
altogether after dark.  If you have to camp on the road do it in a 
truck stop parking lot.  Park near some lights.  You might even let 
the owner know you are there and see if it is ok.  Some of those foam 
ear plugs are handy for keeping down the truck noise.  Jim
