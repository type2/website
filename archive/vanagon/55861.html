Subject: Advice request. Thinking about buying a later &quot;waterboxer&quot; vanagon
Date: Wed, 12 Feb 1997 09:41:21 -0800

Pleas give me some ideas as to what to expect for maintenance, maintenance costs, mileage, reliability, and which models to avoid.

Also, toying with the idea of a Tristar Sycnhro.

Any information and experiences would be appreciated.

Thanks!
