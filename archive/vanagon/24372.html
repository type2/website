Subject: Re: Aftermarket rocker arms?

When I first got my 1.25:1 rockers from Claudes, they were a tight fit on
the shaft and I had to hone them to size with a brake cylinder hone.  Don't
make the mistake of thinking they will 'wear in', they won't, they will
freeze up and pop the pushrod out, or break it.
