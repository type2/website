Dirk,

It may be a long shot, but my '83 had similiar symptoms to the 
ones that you described in your post to the vanagon list.  After 
limping home over a 5k ft. pass with no power, dense black smoke,
etc. I found that a wire had come off the &quot;full throttle switch.&quot;
This is the upper switch on the throttle shaft of the air box.
Seems that an open circuit here tells the brain to go to full
rich.  If that is the problem, it is a simple (though expen$ive)
fix; like $60 for a small micro switch.

Let me know.
