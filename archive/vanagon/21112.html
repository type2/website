I put one in a 72 bus years ago.  It was an old VDO tach I got from my brother
who had used it in a Datsun.  It originally came from an Opel.  I mounted it
in the clock opening on the dash.  There were three connectors on the back.
The tach had the terminal numbers which matched with the engine terminals.
Basically it had one ground and the other two connected to the coil.  It worked
until we sold the bus.
