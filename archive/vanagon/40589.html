Subject: Re: air cooled? : non van

The following cars are also aircooled:

-Citroen 2CV, 2 cyl boxer (652cc i believe)
-Citroen GSA, 4 cyl boxer
-Tatra, 3500cc V8 aircooled, mounted in rear, Czechoslowakia, in Germany
 conversion adaptors available for installation of this motor in VWs, the
 motor itself is available from Tatra factory for about US$ 2500
-DAF 33, 2 cyl boxer, small Dutch car
-There was a BMW 1800 boxer aircooled, but i don't know anything about it
-Certain Fiat 500's i believe the ones that were built by the Steyr Puch factory
-And i've heard of an eastern European truck with a 6 or 8 cyl inline aircooled
 it had adjustable cyl.headheight to alter compression as to be able to use
 various fuels
