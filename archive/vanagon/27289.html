&gt; 
&gt; Opie, my '68 crew cab, has been updated with a dual port 1600 engine.  When 
&gt; I first got him, I removed the engine to check it over and found that the PO 
&gt; had wired the heater box flaps to full open position.  I assumed the heater 
&gt; cables needed replacing and removed his &quot;solution&quot;.  After lubricating the 
&gt; cables, they now work fine, but where they end (up high) and where the 
&gt; connection is on the heater box control lever (down low) is way far apart.
&gt; 
&gt; Question - is there a difference in the bus and bug heater boxes for these 
&gt; years?  
&gt; Does it just appear that I have the wrong heater boxes?  Bentley manuals for 
&gt; the 68-79 bus and 66-69 bug have the same picture for the heater boxes, but 
&gt; I know that the cable couldn't possibly reach where the heater box 
&gt; connection is - the cable has a welded on bracket to the frame.
&gt; 
&gt; TIA,
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; BTW - coat hanger wire holds them open just fine.......all the time.....

You have discovered the difference in the heater boxes. On the bug
the cables connect down below. The bus connections are on top. There
is a kit that you can buy to make the modification.
