&gt;Someone mentioned how they thought my idea of a power supply fan would
&gt;be ineffective.  Well I tested it by using a 9V battery, and blowing 
&gt;thru an 18 foot linoleum roll.  The result?  Pretty darn good, and 
&gt;prolly a bit better than the amount of air you get up an the windsheild
&gt;of a split window bus anyway.  So I'm going to go ahead with my plan.
&gt;The only difficult part will be finding scraps of pipe to use - I don't
&gt;wanna but a who length just for this experiment!

That was me, Thom. I didn't mean to pour cold water on your idea, but all 
the power supply fans I've seen have been small and quiet things. The fan I 
put in was BIG and bloody noisy and blew a huge amount of air when I tested 
it before fitting it. (It also draws a lot of juice and flattened my battery 
pretty quick while I was trying it out) But once its in the bus and trying 
to push the air through all that convoluted ducting, there's not a whole lot 
of power left by the time it gets to the windshield. This is just my 
experience FWIW. The results were disappointing, although still a big 
improvement, so I'm going to try a different approach with two fans.
