Subject: /f Observations on Calif.

Hello all-
after a 2 week foray into the fine state of California visiting 
relatives i thought i would offer some comments from a flatlander's 
perspective.

First off, CA is undeniably a beautiful state.  apparently this opinion 
is held by a few bazillion other people because they all seem to live 
there.  mind you, i'm a hick from the sticks but gawd there be a slew 
of y'all out there.  even at 10:00 at night the freeways were filled 
with traffic.  i now know why Californians are in such a hurry when 
they drive-- it's because they have to wait in line for everything; 
gas, groceries, toilets.  the metropolitan cities of Minneapolis/St. 
Paul seem downright rural compared to the hording throngs in the San 
Fransico to Sacremento area.  yes, i went thru a mild culture shock.  
or maybe it was just the shock from the minor earthquake we had out 
there.  i was lying in bed in this tiny travel travel my son (3 y.o.) 
and i were in and the darn thing started shaking.  being the 
flatlander i am, i thought my boy was playing around and rocking the 
trailer.  it wasn't until i went into the apartment with all my 
wife's relatives did i find i had experienced my first quake.  what 
is the saying.. ignorance is bliss?

anyway, i met up with the infamous Steven Johnson for lunch and beer. 
 his '91 Westy is the envy of us all, despite the main bearing knock 
i noticed.  just kidding Steve.  (i think it was only a rod)  Steve 
and i consulted over a car stereo i contemplated installing in my 
niece's car but alas, the vermin that availed themselves of her 
previous stereo left too much damage for a quick installation.  
she'll have to pay the Big Boys to install this one.  While old hat 
for those California Camping Crazies, it was enjoyable to meet a 
fellow listmember.  the commonality of our love for our vehicles 
seems to allow an immediate rappor on a certain level.  Steve was a 
gracious host (yes, he paid for my lunch and a Paul Bunyan sized 
wheat beer) and has a standing invitation to northern Minnesota.

those of you contemplating buying a rusty van for use or restoration 
really should take a trip out of the rust-belt.  i didn't realize the 
number of fine vans left without &quot;Fred Flintstone&quot; floors.  there are 
many many daily-drivers running around that haven't been restored or 
lavishised with doting care that are completely rust-free.  it is 
amazing.  busses and bugs.  they're everywhere.

it had been 12 years since i had last been in CA and it was nice to 
be able to get fresh whole steamed crabs, REAL sourdough, and see the 
ocean again.  but i will gladly remain tucked away in the northwoods 
where, on a winters evening with the moonlight on the snow, one can 
drive for over an hour with the headlights off-- eyes completely 
adjusted to the dark, and never meet another car.
