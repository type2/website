&gt;&gt; Micheal, shame on you for bringing up crass monetary concerns about the
&gt;&gt; price of fuel for heaven's sake.  Sure it's a bit cheaper to the
&gt;&gt; south but is it really that important?

&gt;I kinda figured we could all drive single file *real* close together, like
&gt;they do in bike races (drafting, is that what they call it?).  I bet we
&gt;could all get 30 mpg :)

&gt;Hey, if we all drive single file with trailer hitches and tow
&gt;ropes in between only ONE person needs to buy gas!  Who wants
&gt;to push?  Who wants to pull?  Also, think of the lack
&gt;of air resistance for the person not in front!  Wow!
&gt;

Do we all chip in for gas for the guy stuck in the lead? ;-)  Maybe we need
to switch off once in a while, but that would involve ... PASSING!  Or maybe
the leader of the moment will just break down to let the next in line pass.
But then we'd all have to stop.  What about those vistas of open road ahead
we all got these bricks for?  I know I hate seeing the back end of a big
square truck thing in front of me... Oh, it's another VW, sorry...

By the way, I am interested in this big loop trip, but I can't make any
commitment since I'm unemployed.  I hope to fix that soon, but then I don't
know if I could get the time for much of a trip.  It seems I either have
lots of time and no money, or a little money and no time...
