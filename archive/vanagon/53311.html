Subject: For Sale: '80 Vanagon w/Chevy V6 engine


Hi, all. Long time no /see.

Finally bought an Aerostar, so the V6anagon has to go. It's been fun,
interesting, frustrating at times-- in other words, a pretty typical
bus. It's also been a blast keeping up with traffic and accelerating
just like a real car-- definitely *atypical* for a bus!

It has only a few spots of rust, and about 30K miles on a rebuilt
and balanced Chevy 2.8L V6 engine from an '81 Citation, plus radiator,
fan, etc. It was installed by the guy I bought it from in Missouri,
with a Kennedy Engineered Products adapter. Uses the standard VW clutch
and 4-speed tranny.

I replaced the clutch this last summer, and am still not sure why it
went bye-bye. Clutch feels sweet now.

I've refined the controls and accessories a lot since I got it. Throttle
is now pretty smooth and light, making it fun to drive! Still handles
as well as a Vanagon, but accelerates... well, it's no hot rod, but it
keeps up with most minivans, and does 65 up long hills in 4th. And the
Volvo heater under the back seat is *wonderful*.

Bad news is, with the engine change and the conversion from fuel
injection to carburetor (Holley 2-bbl), most (well, all) smog equipment
seems to have gone away, and the California smog people sorta take a
dim view of that. I'd probably have to put a cat and smog pump on it
(the mounts are there, and parts are available, but no time and not much
more interest), and then take it to a referee station and act real
polite. Other states may be more lenient. It was (and still is) titled
in Missouri, so should be no problem there, and in other states that are
a little less tight than California.

I'd like to get $1,000 for it.

It's a good project car, and a lot of fun to drive. Breaks down about as
much as any 16-year-old VW, leaks oil, gets 21 mpg on the freeway, less in
town. All gauges work except the 4-digit trip odometer, and even the
engine temp gauge the PO put in the dash seems accurate, now that I've
replaced the sensor. Excellent tires, good 7-pass interior, a few small
dings on the outside.

Any suckers\\\\\\\adventurous souls out there, who'd like a fun older
VW with lotsa room?
