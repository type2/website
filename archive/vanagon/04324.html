&gt;I have one question;  is the dash fan used only for the side vents?

as i understood it, the dash fan was simply to blow out of the heater vents
in the middle console area of the dash ... to help defrost the windshield
and heat your feet (depending on which way the lever was moved).  on my old
80 bus, the side vents (the square ones that were on the vertical part of
the dash) were only fresh air vents. but on later vanagons, these were
hooked up to the controls, and fresh/hot air came out, depending on the
levers. and the fan blew air out of them.

so i think vw changed the hookups for the side vents, but i don't know for
sure just what year it was. or maybe my 80 was hooked up wrong.

&gt;My Westy also sends out heated air at all times, but I attributed it to
&gt;the mess the previous owner made when he removed the air cond.

probably the loose cable clamp or broken cable sheath ... take off the
instrument pod and take the ash tray out and look down around in there
while you move the levers back and forth. you might be able to see where
the cable has become de-tached or the sheath is broken (allowing the whole
mess to move).
