The address of Pon's Automobiel Handel is:

Volkswagen:

	Pons's Automobiel Handel
	Zuiderinslag 2
	Leusden
	the Netherlands
	Tel. 00 31 33 4949944

Porsche:

	Pon's Automobiel Handel
	Arnhemseweg 2
	Amersfoort
	the Netherlands
	Tel. 00 31 33 4949911

The guy was the first who officially exported VW's out of Germany
(these cars went to the Netherlands) and sold the first VW's for
the USA to (i believe) Max Hoffman in the late fortys.

I have a catalog in front of me of Bernd Ahnendorp Sport, aka. BAS,
Ahnendorp autoteile or Ahnendorp GmbH.

This is a well respected German company. They offer machine service and
High Performance parts of the highest quality. They seem to specialize in
all VW boxer engines, from upright to 2.1 Wasserboxer to 2866cc T IV.
In their catalog (I paid 10.- DM for it) i see 98mm aluminum cylinders
from Oetinger and 103 mm aluminum cylinders from BAS, both sets include
Mahle pistons and are nicasil-plated. Both sets are for the T IV.
Wait, i'll look for the Wasserboxer stuff... yes, here it is; they have
98mm cylinders for the Wasserboxer as well, includes forged pistons.
(probably Mahle) For camshafts they ask you to look on the upright
camshaft pages. Some parts look interchangable with the upright engine.
I once saw and heard Mr. Ahnendorp's own car, UNBELIEVEABLE,it's a
1303, a super if you like, the engine was a perfectly balanced T IV
with the in Germany common Porsche cooling, it's sound was the BEST i
ever heard coming out of a flat four, so perfectly smooth, i can't
explain it :) Their address is:

	Ahnendorp GmbH
	Klever Strasse 8
	4294 Iselburg 2
	Anholt
	Germany
	Tel. 02874 4047 (look for Gemany's country number)
	Fax. 02874 1816 (look for Gemany's country number)

They do mail orders outside of Germany but i don't know about shipping
to the US.

Hope it helps,

Brian.
