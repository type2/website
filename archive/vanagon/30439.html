Subject: Breadloaf bus ducting
Date: Sat, 09 Dec 1995 22:45:37 EST

Hey all,
	I was thinking about the recommendations for those fans you can
	buy at boating stores to improve defrosting efficiency.  I'm
	having trouble imagining things, so if you could help me out I'd
	appreciate it.

	On the top of the bus dash, there's a vent smack in the center
	and there are two more defroster vents, one on each side.  Are
	all these vents connected to the heat line or is it just the one
	in the middle or is it just the ones on the side?  I'm thinking
	it's just the one in the middle and I'm thinking the  ones on
	the sides are for fresh air and not heated air.  Could someone
	clear this one up for me?  By the way, I'm speaking of late
	model buses, like '77-'79.  

	Also, how big are these boating fans?  Could you conceivably
	install one in line with that big round heat hose under the bus
	to speed heat flow while perhaps purchasing two more smaller
	fans, one to be installed inline with the fresh air ducting andn
	one to be installed with the defroster ducting or are fresh air
	and defroster ducting one in the same?  Is three fans overkill
	or what?  

	Here's what i'm thinking -- one larger fan in line with the big
	heat tube under the bus for the express purpose of speeding
	heater flow.  This fan would be placed toward the front of the
	tube, so it would probably also help defroster flow quite a bit.
	I was also thinking of a smaller fan to help with fresh air
	flow, as fresh air flow is nonexistent when the bus isn't moving
	and it's a bitch to keep the windows clear in a VW in a summer
	rainstorm if you're in traffic (been there, had a bug with same
	fresh air system).  If the defroster ducting is separate from
	fresh air ducting, perhaps a third fan to help with that if the
	fan in line with the big tube isn't enough (which it probably
	would be).

	So, I would like to know what is the deal with the
	defroster/fresh air ducting.  Is it the same or is it two
	separate systems or are they connected and if so, how?  I'm
	betting that they're connected somehow.  I can envision a nice
	little setup with three little toggle switches mounted on a
	single panel under the dash to do the job.  I don't want to
	overload the electrical system, but all of these hypothetical
	fans would not be running at the same time except in the even of
	some freak weather occurence :) .  Am I thinking about this too
	hard or does some of this make sense?  Thanks in advance for any
	and all help.

	Sean
