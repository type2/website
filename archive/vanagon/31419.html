&gt;  tank, Sink cabinet with burners and all the plumbing, rear side 
&gt;  cabinet, upper cabinet, and the cooler unit. The guy said it was an

&gt;  price is $275 which I felt was a tad steep. My questions are: is this 
&gt;  a fair price? Is the electric fridge worth the hassle of dealing with 
&gt; 

That doesn't sound too steep a price but I'd keep looking until I found
a setup with a fridge that runs on AC/DC/LPG.  I wouldn't want to mess
with trying to keep the fridge running off of a battery.  Especially
if you plan to do any extended trips.
