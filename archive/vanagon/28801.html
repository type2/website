Subject: 65 UnEarthing - how/where to attach drag chain?

I will be buying a 65 Camper next saturday :), not sure if its a westy, and
its been sitting for 8 years at the bottom of a sunken driveway [basement
level garage, lower than street...].

I will be using the tires/wheels from my 68 westy, unless someone points out
that they will not fit, to aid in the extraction from the rust pit [eight
years of accumulated leaves have created SOIL!].

The existing tires have cracks the size of the Grand Canyon......

There is a mouse nest in one of the drawers.......

But boy oh boy does it have restoration potential!!!!

What I am hoping is that someone out there can tell me where to attach the
chain that will be used to pull it out.  It is parked nose in.  The rear
bumper is loose and would not handle the load.  Cant get the engine door
open, car parked behind it slid into rear.  There are 14 inches on each side
to work with. I have never seen the underside of a 65 splittie and would be
most gratefull to anyone who can advise.



Thanks in advance.......
