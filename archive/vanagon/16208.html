Subject: TRIPS/ EARTH DAY



My apologies for not giving enough warning last friday about the earth day 
BBQ I had on  Saturday, it was a hectic week with friends in town. :)  I 
shall attempt to give a little more notice to be able to reply to inquiries 
next time.

Anyway----EAST COAST TRIP   it is starting to get warm
         
Trips on the west coast are a bit too far for my bus to travel in one weekend.
Is there any support for a east coast/Applachia/Smokey's/Catskills/Poconos or 
something gathering for us not so hip easterners.   As a starter suggestion I 
am aware of a bluegrass festival in NY called the Blue Heron that is supposed 
to be pretty interesting the last weekend of June (maybe, need to check my 
references)   Let me hear your thoughts.  Weekends that are currently shot 
for me are 5/27, 6/6 and 6/24.  There is the VA Wine Festival either the 2nd 
or 3rd weekend in June. (Been there twice)  I think we are going to camp this 
year.   No need to have an event to plan the trip around of course.

LET ME HAVE YOUR THOUGHTS on dates and places AND WE SHALL SEE WHAT WE CAN DO

(Assuming of course I replace my tranny by the corresponding dates :)  )
