Howdy doodoo

Well, I got all my interior panels covered now, between last night and 
this afternoon.

I did them in a medium blue plaid that complements the paint, and put 1/4&quot;
foam underneath, giving a nice comfy look.

I also put the seat/bed back in (for the LAST time, I hope!) and I'd 
forgotten how much quieter it makes the bus!

I think the foam on the interior panels help to dampen the noise a bit, too!
