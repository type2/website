&gt; &gt; Well I took a look and:
&gt; &gt; &quot;Volkswagon Bus Camper Van 1979-89&quot; by R.M. Bentley was published in _1911_ and 
&gt; &gt; sells for $16.95           ^^^^^^^                                    ^^^^
&gt; 
&gt; 	Wow, I new Bentley's are good, but thats a little scary. :)

And now for some virtual reality:

&quot;Volkswagon Eurovan 1992-95&quot; by R. M. Bentley, published in _YOUR DREAMS_
