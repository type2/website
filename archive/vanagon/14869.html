&gt; &gt;Howabout a trip thru NH, VT or even Cape Cod for part of the Eastern
&gt; &gt;Leg....Cape Cod is great in the late spring/early summer....the touristes
&gt; &gt;don't really start arriving and become annoying until &gt;7/4.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'd be glad to coordinate something on the Cape.

&gt; 
&gt; All right, finally we break through to the Far East. Boston is 8-10hrs away, 
&gt; count us in for anything between there and Maine. White/ Green Mountains NH, 
&gt; are great, except for those diesel Westies. Get your &quot;This vehicle smogged 
&gt; Mt Washington&quot; stickers here.  tim s.

If your talking far south I'm in too!!!  I'm in St. Augustine but I've 
got a good friend in ATlanta (Superbug) who I could pick up on the way.
Later summer is better!  Repairs first, then GNATT.
