&gt;Kathy,
&gt;
&gt;Have you checked out the wiring?  Your motors -may- be just fine with
&gt;your problems coming from a break in the wire somewhere (possibly
&gt;grounding out with just a tear in the insulation, no less).  What
&gt;exactly are your symptoms?  There have been a number of
&gt;problems/solutions talked about that you should be able to find in the
&gt;archives.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck,

Tonya,

Thanks!  Symptoms have been several:  first, when I gave it a good washing
one day, the locks started going up and down, up and down!  This went on
for a couple of minutes until I pulled the fuse.  Seems the water got in
somehow.  I checked the driver side lock and found a tear in the rubber
accordian-type cover (above motor).  Problem resolved on its own.

Later, pushing the driver lock down did not automatically lock the
passenger side, but if you pushed down the passenger side it DID lock the
driver side.

So for a while, I just locked using passenger side.  The other day, I
couldn't push either lock down manually or with the key.

Does that give you any ideas?  I'm going to try the grease suggestion from
Joel Walker and I'll look more closely at the wires.

Kathy
