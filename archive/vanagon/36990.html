Subject: Hunter specs for Syncro Alignment

My mechanic cross ref'ed the info from Derek's Syncro alignment
writeup and they match exactly.

In other words, Hunter has updated all their specs. Now, if your
mechanic has not updated his machine and or specs, this info will 
be out of date.

According to my mechanic, (who I put in the Dennis Haynes and Bob 
Hoover category when it comes to car knowledge), Hunter is extremely
conscientious about informing their customers about problems with
Hunter made equipment. He was not surprised that the info had been
updated correctly in the Hunter specs.

As a final note, he received a letter from Hunter today announcing
that Hunter has a web page, check out http://www.hunter_dot_com.

I can't web surf from this account but I'll check it tonight from
my ISP.
