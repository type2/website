Thanks.  It looks like this is the case (sigh).  My symptoms are identical to
Dave Johnson's as he described Friday.  I had the cooling system bled on
Friday morning and every thing was cool (sorry) until Saturday.  I bled
the system again on Saturday and the system maintained well until this
morning.  Can any Bay Area folks recommend a mechanic I can take this
to?  How much can I expect to set me back if I have the heads machined
and gaskets replaced?  I guess I'll have to chalk this up to some sort
of right of passage.  My Irish half will be content to have tales of
woe to tell over single malt wiskeys while my German half will be
snickering.
