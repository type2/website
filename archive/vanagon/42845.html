Subject: Re: DOT removes gas shocks from HazMat classification

Dan -

We stopped doing that almost two months ago.  The reclassification was
effective March 1, 1996 via a memo FAXED from KYB to us on March 15th.  Rest
assured, no one to my knowledge has been docked for the fee since then and I
for one am glad that I don't have to fill out all these crazy forms any more
or dock anyone for that crazy fee. BTW - UPS was docking $10 regardless of
how many shocks, 1 or 20, were in the box - it was per package, not per
shock.

Thanks for letting the list know and it's appreciated.
