&gt; Is there going to be any list members going to Manassas this
&gt; weekend? I'll be there with the Vanagon and my convertible will be
&gt; in the show...

Not sure yet, my transmission is still leaking kinda bad.
If you see a rainbow '67 with a smiley face on the front, you'll know I
made it. If so, do stop by and say hello...
