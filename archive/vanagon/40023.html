Subject: PNW campin 4/27?

Last  time I suggested this I got many responses. This time I got two.
How about it, anyone interested?
Date: April 27 weekend
Place: Fort Flagler State Park, Marrowstone Island, WA (on the way to Pt
Townsend). There is a bridge connecting to mainland.
Time: whenever

Its a pretty big place, I don't think reservations would be needed. Just
wondering if anyone is interested.

An alternative date/location:
May 4 weekend
Moran State Park, Orcas Island, WA ( a much longer trip - no bridge)

The Backcountry Bicycles Trail Club is going to be having a ride up/down Mt
Constition that weekend and I'm thinking about going to that as well.
Its another large campground.
(This would probably be an interesting mix of people - a bunch of tired
mtb'ers sleeping in tents and a bunch of ? sleeping in vans?)
