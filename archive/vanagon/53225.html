&gt; 	By the way, I've looked into all kinds of possibilities for improving
&gt; the low-end of the music spectrum in that van.  I put a wedge subwoofer
&gt; behind the drives seat (not really enough room to sound really good),
&gt; boxes between the front seats (takes up too much space, although one
&gt; might make a nice console if cupholders were added), under the back seat
&gt; (too muffled and took up too much storage space), on the floor in front
&gt; of back seat (too noticable to would-be theives).

If/when I get around to it I had decided that under the back seat was the
best option. Otherwise its unused space apart from the auxiliary heater. I
thought of replacing the hardboard trim panel with one cut out of MDF and
then mounting one or two eight inch drivers into it. I know it would not
make a perfect seal, but I have yet to see any evidence that the leakage of
air will cancel the bass too much. Otherwise I would have to make a sealed
box for under the rear seat and thats a lot more hassle.
