Subject: 3/21 pinnacles vs. panamint?


A few nights ago a small contigency of us from the camp/van/bus
group went to the top of Mt. Hamilton to check out its suitability
as a location for our upcoming camping trip March 21-24.  Since
we are looking for exceptional night visability in order to see
the comet and the eclipse on that weekend, we wanted to see if
the atmosphere was clear enough for our purposes, as well as
far enought away from city electrical light, etc.  While the
site passed on the latter, the skys had a few clouds of an
ambigious enough nature that it was hard to be convinced this
place would provide optimum visability for us.  In addition, a
few of you have told me forget trying to camp there.

I therefore suggest that we go to plans B and C, which means
deciding between the 2 next sites receiving a significant
number of nominations.  These are Pinnacles (about 28
miles south of Hollister) and Panamint Springs (near
Death Valley).  I suspect that Panamint would offer
a tremendous view if we luck out on weather.  I think
we can arrange space at either.

So, now I need a majority vote to decide between the two.  Please
e-mail asap; if I don't hear from you, I'll assume either is
acceptable.

Here's who has signed up so far to attend.  Please let me know
of additions or deletions.  In either location, we need a
head count:
