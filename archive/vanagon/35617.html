Subject: RE: I shift; bus don't go...


&gt;Coming home for lunch today, I turned off the major street onto my own,
&gt;downshifted and released the clutch petal, only to hear a little clicking
&gt;and feel a little coasting. Rev, Rev, Coast, Coast.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Note: I have had some pretty stiff shifting lately and in the absense of
&gt;any better advice, I'll probably start by examining the linkage near the
&gt;tranny--I've noticed this is very sloppy and replacement parts are very
&gt;near the top of my &quot;things to buy for the bus&quot; list. This may not be
&gt;fruitful, though, as the bus feels as though she's moving into gear, even
&gt;though she's not moving when I release the clutch.

Tranny parts are indeed a possible suspect... but if I were you, I'd start
by checking the CV joints (for '68 and later) and clutch first.

If your bus is a '68 or later, start the engine, put it in gear, and let
out the clutch, like you're trying to drive away but it won't. Go 'round
back and look underneath. Is one of your axles turning? Or, is one of the
drive plates on either side of the tranny, turning without turning its axle
shaft? If either of these is true, then you've got a broken CV joint-- 
that's
what you get for not listening to that little clickclickclick sound it
made when going around turns for the last few weeks.

I replaced a CV on my '69 bus years ago, after not listening to that little
clickclickclick sound it made when going around turns for the last few 
weeks,
and it wasn't too hard once I got the bolts started-- they needed an allen
wrench. I broke a cheap Allen wrench, then got a Craftsman and had no 
further
problems.

If nothing's turning when the car is in gear, then it may be your clutch.
The bad news here is, you have to take the engine out to fix ANYTHING in
there, so you might want to get a new flywheel seal while

Since you didn't mention any clutch-pedal problems (like it falls to the
floor and stays there) I'd guess your clutch cable is OK. Too bad-- it's
the easiest part to check and/or replace. Clutch cable was unlikely anyway,
since it would grind like crazy going into any gear, and lug the engine
to a stop as you stopped unless you banged the shift handle into neutral.

As you step on the clutch pedal, does it move easily for part of its travel,
then get a little stiffer as you press it all the way down? That's how it
should be. If it doesn't seem to get any stiffer, but goes all the way
down with a light push, then you may have either a throwout bearing that's
fallen off, or a broken cross shaft, or a messed-up pressure plate. If the
pedal stiffens the way it should, then you might have a broken clutch disc.
I haven't seen too many such broken clutch discs, but the V6anagon had one
when I first heard about it.

Good luck!
