Subject: Re: Mileage on original engines

My old vanagon has about 225,000 on the original engine, it did have one 
head replaced at 80,000 miles from an overheat that occured before I 
bought it.

Still running strong, no smoke, oil was/is changed almost never (20,000+
miles apart) and for the last year and a half has not had a working
radiator fan. 

(I don't own it anymore)
