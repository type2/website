Subject: vanagon seat covers

Good day all,

The latest J.C. Whipme sale catalog has seat covers at 14%
off. Has anybody installed these seat covers on their
vanagon's seats? Are they any good?

I had Whipme seat covers in a '65 bug, heavy vinyl, good fit
and the price had been reasonable. I liked 'em.

On a side note, SEWFINE does NOT have vanagon seat covers at
this time. They may have them later this year or the begining
of '96.

TIA,
