Subject: sliding door lock, 82 vanagon


Does anybody know how to fix the sliding door lock on an 82 vanagon? In 
my van (name: turtle, what else could you call a diesel westy), the 
little knob on the inside that locks the sliding door does not stay in 
the &quot;open&quot; position any more. To open the door you have to either push 
the knob up (from the inside) or keep the key turned (from the outside). 
It seems like a spring or something is missing. 
Does anybody know how to remove the door panel in order to get to the lock?

Many thanks, 
Joerg
