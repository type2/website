&gt;&gt;What are others doing?

Jim,

I brought up the subject of using Ice Guard (used by roofing contractors)
as a means of limiting van noise, but was told by Bill Devlin to stay away
from this stuff. Bill said:

&gt;Friendly warning!!! These self adhesive roofing underlayments contain skin
&gt;and eye irritants and give off unpleasant and potentially damaging vapors!
&gt;They should not be used without CAREFUILLY READING ALL OF THE MFGR'S
&gt;WARNINGS AND THE PRODUCT TECHNICAL DATA SHEETS, which are available from any
&gt;authorized wholesaler of roofing materials. BTW, the product is heat
&gt;sensitive, and can be thermally bonded to most surfaces (including you) by
&gt;the use of a heat gun or hair dryer.
&gt;
&gt;As a general contractor who has used these products for years, I can testify
&gt;to the fact that they must be handled with care and caution. More than one
&gt;of my workmen received severe skin or eye inflamations from handling these
&gt;products without adequate protection. I also caution you against using them
&gt;in closed, unventilated environments (like the inside of a VW Transporter)
&gt;because of the fumes they give off. Be carefull!! It's a jungle out there!!

So I guess the question remains, does anyone know of a low cost alternative
to Dynamat that doesn't limit your life span?
