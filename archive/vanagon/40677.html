My wife used to bring her pet rat, Vermin, along on camping trips we took 
in our '67 bus.  I have to say that Vermin hated traveling and didn't 
seem to enjoy camping at really great places.  In the van, Vermin liked 
to sit in your lap or hang out in the parcel tray and chew up the wires 
that hang down under there.  On one trip to Anza Borrego, Vermin got sick 
and looked ready to die.  Yvonne asked me to shoot him to put him out of 
his misery.  I told her we couldn't shoot Vermin in Anza as discharging 
firearms is not allowed in the State Park.  Also, I was not too keen on 
killing Vermin by any method.  I put Vermin in a box and let him be.   
When we got back home Vermin immediately recovered and was fine.  I guess 
that the moral of the story is to leave small pets at home or with 
someone you can trust.  Horses travel better but that is another story.
