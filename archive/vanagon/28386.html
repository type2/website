Got some response about the Harbor Freight sale price so
for everyone who asked.  In catalog #55, fall 1995 (under
a month old I'm pretty sure).

21 pc 3/4&quot; drive socket set, normal $45.99 for $39.95
page 5, item 05494-9GGB (metric)

and to finish out the $50 for free shipping my rec is

16 pc industrial punch and chisel set normal $15.99, for $12.93
page 13, item 00249-6GGA

or

9 pc wobble extension set normal $14.99 for $12.95
page 7, item 31203-4GGA

Have fun with the BIG tools everyone.
