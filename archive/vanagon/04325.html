&gt;Yeah, I've seen that hole in the front of the door, but it really seemed
&gt;to me after looking at it that it was not connected AT ALL to the vent
&gt;with the blue knob.

it's not exactly 'connected', it's just that both open to the inside of the
door ... so the air flows whichever way the low pressure is (or something
like that).

&gt;Interesting you should mention heat, because in all of this, there is no
&gt;way to get heat to come out of either the vents above the windows, or the
&gt;vents in the bottom of the doors.  Has anyone closed all the vents above
&gt;the windows and opened the ones in the doors?  This aught to cause fresh
&gt;air to come out of the ones in the doors.

uhhhhh. sorry bout that. it's not heat coming OUT of the vents, it's that
the vents mix fresh air into the interior of the bus, and thereby 'regulate'
the heat inside. more of a mixer than a heat vent. sort of. kinda. maybe.
