Subject: Re: RE: vanagon longevity?

I was thinking of getting undercoating for my 87 vanagon but then read the
owner's manual suggesting that this was not advisable due to the high
temperature of the exhaust system.  Any thoughts.  Although it is often wet
here in Seattle we do not get the salt that the rustbelt gets and so do not
have many of the rust problems associated with the midwest and northeast.
 Any thoughts on undercoating the vanagon to prevent rust damage??
