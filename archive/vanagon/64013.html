Subject: Re: Newbie &amp; A/C caused overheating

All,

I just returned from a trip through the Mojave desert during which I ran
the A/C non-stop in 120 degree heat, going up hills with it floored in
third gear.  In addition we had four riders, the van was packed to the
gills w/camping stuff and we were pulling a light trailer also loaded to
the gills.  All this with one cylinder at 80 lbs compression!

The heat gauge never moved above the top of the indicator light and
normally stayed about 1/2 way between the bottom of it and the bottom
line.  

I find this amazing, especially since my van also regularly ran hot.  I
made two changes which I believe are the reason for the van running so
cool.  One I got from this list, which was to change the little plug
sensor in the radiator (forgot its' name) that causes the radiator to come
on sooner.  The other change which was recommended by the local VW shop,
was to swap out the the thermostat that is located just below the radiator
overflow tank.  (pain in the ass to do!)

If anyone is interested in the exact part numbers of these items I'll
get them for you.

&gt; Don Gibbons answers to my questions are below. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks Don, I appreciate the info on the head gaskets. While the air 
&gt; conditioner is wonderful, I have been careful to turn it down or off if 
&gt; the temperature gauge moves above the indicator light. I have even turned 
&gt; the heater on when I was in bumper to bumper traffic to keep the temp 
&gt; indicator near the light and not above it. Am I being too cautious? The 
&gt; fellow I bought it from recommended doing this to keep it cool. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again.

&gt; &gt;Hi, welcome to the list.
&gt; &gt;1. I may have started this thread about hi temps and head gasket problems.
&gt; &gt;The water jacket gasket is made of a rubberlike material and as such will go
&gt; &gt;bad the higher temp it is exposed to. Anything that keeps the gasket temp
&gt; &gt;down will make it last longer. I sugested a coolant re-circulation pump as
&gt; &gt;are on some recent VW's. Other then changing the coolant and making sure
&gt; &gt;that it does not get low there is nothing that can be done to help gasket
&gt; &gt;life (short of getting the gasket temp down)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;2. Only a little high. If you walked into a VW dealer and asked that the
&gt; &gt;entire system from heads to tail pipe be replaced the bill would come to
&gt; &gt;three digits (yes maybe $3,000) All is not so dim. The after market has all
&gt; &gt;parts at a fraction of the dealer price. I did my syncro (most of the parts)
&gt; &gt;for less then $600. But keep in mind that the factory parts are very good
&gt; &gt;and last a long time
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;3. The best site is the list and its archives.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;4. I had a 82 that was not very good in the snow depending on how loaded it
&gt; &gt;was. With empty it was OK. With a full load (lots in front) it was not very
&gt; &gt;good. After that I had a 87 syncro (so maybe I am spoiled) with 4 snow tires
&gt; &gt;that went thru anything. Studed tires are best in bad conditions and should
&gt; &gt;get you thru most winters.

&gt; &gt;73 super.
