Subject: re:Lug wrenches

tcasey_at_hdrinc_dot_com was complaining about his lug wrench, or lack thereof due
to breakage.

I currently have one of those that are in the shape of a plus sign, or X if
you hold it at an angle.  I have yet to have a problem with this wrench.
When I got my Thing, I think the last person to put the lug nuts on was
Hercules, or Superman, as I had to stand on one side of the wrench, and pull
on the other.  The wrench did not complain at all. As a bonus the wrench as
three different sized sockets, and a pry bar type end on the 4th side, so
you can use it on just about any car.  If you get one of those, be sure that
it fits you vehicle, as there is no standard for these wrenches.
