Subject:  76 Type II valve adjustment 

Volks: My Haynes Manual says to adjust the valves, on my van, the wheels need
      to be removed. Is this true? I'd rather not if it isn't needed, because    
     adds a lot of effort to the job? IE: jacking, stands, tire removal....

   Second question will I need any special tools above Open/box wrenches,
  feelers, srewdrviers etc? If so what?


Thanks
