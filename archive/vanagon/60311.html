&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone make a suggestion as to how to send an images file via
&gt; E-Mail?  I am trying to send a bit map image of my Vanagon to an other
&gt; person. The last time I tried his server could not handle the attached
&gt; file size.   ?????

You really do need to check the size of the image file. You may need to reduce
the file to an acceptable size for e-mail transport. If it is a scanned color
image, and you made no adjustment to it, it could be 1-2 MB ix size. This would
be unacceptable for many e-mail systems -- and I would KILL YOU if you filled
up my mail box with this size file.

What is the purpose of the picture? Is is simply to display on a computer
screen? or does it need to pe printed? If you have a set of web pages, you
could easily place it in a web page and let your friend/receipent grab a copy
that can circumvent some size restrictions. I usually &quot;tone&quot; mine down to
72 dpi - excellent for viewing on computer. Many other methods of reduction
are possible with PhotoShop or other photo handling applications. It really
does depend on the reason for sending and the quality needed by the person
on the other end. A &quot;reasonable&quot; size photo should easily be sent as an 
attachment to your e-mail, but size is important.
