Subject: Incredible regulations (was: VW Engine Fires)



&gt;By the way - if you happen to have a HALON unit, the above does not
&gt;apply. HALON is a gas that liquefies readily under relatively low
&gt;pressures and so is stored in the container as a liquid until
&gt;released. It is quite effective, doesn't leave that horrible hard to
&gt;clean up residue behind, but is no longer available as a fire
&gt;fighting agent because it was said to be bad for the ozone.
                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What??? You gotta be kidding me!!!

Halon is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Highly effective,
non-toxic, non-conductive, puts out ANY fire (gasoline, wood,
electrical), no residue, doesn't harm the thing you're spraying it on
(High-$ computer equipment, car engine &amp; brain box, Aunt Tillie's
prize roses, etc.). And now someone is worried about pollution from
a firefighting chemical? I guess we'd reduce pollution by letting
the fire keep burning? Uh, what's wrong with this picture?

And besides, the &quot;scientists&quot; who sat on the panic button with
both buttocks saying that the ozone layer was thinning, have recently
said &quot;Oh... never mind!&quot;, after finding that it has been cyclically
coming and going for the last 100,000 years or so. Freon, halon,
and termite farts have had NO effect compared to the natural
processes that have been going on since long before these silly
humans started getting delusions of grandeur.


Well, sorry for the not-very-VW-related dump. But I'm sick to death
of these hair-trigger inadequate-research WIMPS who seem to get so
much publicity for the silliest, most inaccurate pronouncements
(saccharin causes cancer... IF you drink 734 cans of sugar-free
soda a day for 10 years. Oh... never mind). Yes, friends, R-12 does
no more harm to the environment than the R-134 you are paying
$1000 to upgrade your A/C system to-- or than the water that drips
off the condenser grille. Fact!

Don't get me wrong-- some of these regulations have done great things--
CAFE standards, emission standards, seat-belt and airbag standards etc.,
none of which would have taken place if the Fedrl Gummint hadn't stepped
in. But for others, you have to wonder if these people have ever ventured
out into the sunshine from their normal abodes.


End of blather. Now reloading human attributes...
