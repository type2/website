Subject: Fuel gauges -- who needs 'em?

Tobin T. Copley writes --
&gt;As for feeling worried about running out of gas on long trips, just use 
&gt;the odometer as a gauge (THAT works, right?), and be sure to fill before 
&gt;you drive anywhere close to your cruising range, say, every 200 miles or &gt;so.

Heck, my '58 Bug doesn't even HAVE a gas gauge and I've never yet run out of
gas (knock on wood.)  The odometer is precisely what you need to watch --
and keep a notebook handy recording purchases &amp; readings.  I'm thinking of
buying a cheap hand-counter (like the kind used to tick-up grocery
purchases) to help me.  This should hold you 'till you figure out what to do
about that gauge.  (Unfortunately your Bus doesn't have a reserve tank
switch, either. . .)
