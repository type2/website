----------------------------------------------------------------------

You could drive the road forever
'Cause there's nothing wrong with going into the sun
You want to punch through the night
You want to see the sun rise
You want to sit on the beach with your loved one

Think of how you bought that VW Camper
How she called to you, looking so proud and so strong
Her poptop gleaming so white like a bit of a cloud
And how you looked so hard but could find nothing wrong

     ***

(refrain:)
You treasure your bus
You never want to lose it
It's been through thirty-five years of hell
And you know it had the rust spots to prove it
So you fixed the rust
You sanded, painted, and smoothed it
That bus has seen a lot of wonderful times
And you know you've got photos to prove it

Remember everything listmembers tell you
Well, everything that's aimed at you
When you break down on the road, keep faith --
You'll be completely amazed --
You'll find you know know exactly what you should do
You won't believe it! And you'll discover, my friend,

That's always something magic
That's always something true
That when you really really need it the most,
That's when Volkswagen dreams come through
The list is here whenever
Most of what we say is true
And when you really really need it the most,
That's when Volkswagen dreams come true ... for you.

     ***

Once upon a time there was a factory
Once upon a time there, buses came to life
Yes, their paint shone so bright that you could see your own face
They were rolled onto ships and sent out into the night

     ***

(refrain)

     ***

That's when Volkswagen dreams come through ...

(repeat to fade)
