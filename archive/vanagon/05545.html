Subject: Lengthening The Upper Bed 

If you are 6'2&quot; as I am then you know that the beds are too short. Your
pillow keeps falling out of the roof or off the end of the bed below unless
you turn around and face the rear of the vehicle. This is OK in the bottom
but you don't want to sleep facing the rear in the top.

The solution I worked out for the top was to take a spare piece of the roof
bed and cut the wood in half so that it was only about 1 foot wide. This
piece is still covered with that nice grey material that we sleep on. I store
in in the roof in the far back, and when I sleeep in the roof I put it in the
hole. This lengthens the bed by 1 foot and I no longer drop things down the
hole. It has the disadvantage that when I want to go down the hole I have to
swivel the piece out of the way, but the tradeoff seems well worth it.

I think all tall Vanagon owners who plan to sleep in the roof from time to
time should consider following my lead.
