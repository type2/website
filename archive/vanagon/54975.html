Subject: EV Power Steering Boots - Disintegrating

Hi,

I was just wondering if any other EV owners had had this happen on theirs.

I found my right side powersteering boot ripped in half at 40k.  The part 
was only $9.00 but the labor was two hours _at_60.00/hr to replace it.  Now 
at 59K i just found the left side boot in two pieces.

Has anybody replaced one of these themselves yet?  

Also, I was wondering if those of you that have performed the posted 
&quot;fix&quot; to the EV gauge problems, have had good or bad results since 
resoldering the connections?
