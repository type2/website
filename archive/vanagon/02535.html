&gt; This afternoon I will be going out to check on a 69 camper for sale--my wife's
&gt; idea. The plan is, if it is in good shape take our 68 &amp; 71 to make one really
&gt; good machine. My main question is, &quot;Is it possible to put the 71's disk brakes
&gt; on the 69? 

 I believe you can do this without too much difficulty, either by swapping the
spindles or by exchanging the whole front axle (attached by bolts through the
chassis). I havn't done it, however, so this is theoretical knowledge rather
than practical experience: sorry!

Cheers,
        W.
