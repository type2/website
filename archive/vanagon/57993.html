 F.Y.I.  RE&gt; Camping

&gt;&gt; Just up route 9 from Saratoga is a place called Saratoga Springs.  They
&gt;&gt; have overnight camping for $20 / vehicle.  It's a nice, wooded place, but
&gt;&gt; the price IS a bit high.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thoughts?
&gt;Have camped there. It is really nice,right next to a creek, as I recall.
&gt;About 30' from Kelley Park.  I am considering driving down from Eugene,
&gt;OR so it would be great to know if this is going to happen or if I
&gt;should skip the whole thing.Anyone who is considering going please let
&gt;me(and the list) know ASAP. Muchas gracias,

If this is the Saratoga Springs that I am thinking of, I would clarify the :
 &quot;&gt;About 30' from Kelley Park. &quot;
where &quot;30' &quot; is somewhere in the neighborhood of 10-15 miles, and depending
upon traffice 30-45 minutes driving time.

My interpretation of &quot; 30'  &quot; was thirty feet, which is definitely
incorrect!
