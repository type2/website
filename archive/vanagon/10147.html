&gt;While we're on the subject, a couple of years ago I replaced the
&gt;curtains in my (April) '71 Campmobile, and I seem to have misplaced
&gt;the plastic doodads which fit in the rail above the sliding door
&gt;unto which the right side curtain does attach. Would anyone have
&gt;a source for replacement of same?
You mean the little hook doodads that are sewn to the curtains?  Or the little
doodads that slide into the ends of the aluminum track to keep the
aforementioned from falling out of the ends of the track?  In either case,
they should be in a junk yard.  I don't know of any place to get them new,
but there's a list of VW suppliers floating around.  I could mail you that
if you're interested.  I think it's got a place that makes new curtains.
They might have parts, too.
