&gt;  There's a final related issue I'd like to hear others address.  I find 
&gt; the Vanagon Westie to be the peak of some kind of hard to describe camper 
&gt; continuum.  I know of no better vehicle available, FOR ANY PRICE, suited 

I have, as a matter of fact, been trying to locate a competitor to 
the Westi for a few years, just to see what I can find.
Here's my undocumented, yet demented report:
Here's the criteria:

Good ground clearance for off road use.
Sleeping and seatbelts for 4 or more (I have 3 kids &amp; a spouse).
Decent power and handling, 4WD a bonus.
Low height for off road/under tree clearance.
Reasonabe cost.

Here are the results of 3 years of looking:

I found a 4WD Dodge small truck based camper that has adequate 
sleeping/belts, 4WD, lotsa power, tall fulltime (no-poptop)
$48,000 yikes

A Dodge or Chevy full size van conversion done in Canada marketed in 
US (at least in WA state).  Lotsa power, standing room where it's 
needed (kitchen only), various floor plans for sleeping for 2 - 4 plus.  
Same ground clearance as std van (read ok but not great).
Non-pop top, but only about 6 inches higher than std van.
Around $40,000, yikes again,  a very nice conversion built for camping 
not a party van as are most US conversions. Includes toilet &amp; shower!

Anybody else out there find anything else?
Reinforced that the Westi is as good as it gets, for far less.
If a big wad of $ dropped on me, I would find a Synchrowesti (dream)
or just keep my '80 running (reality)
