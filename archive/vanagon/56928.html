Subject: Fuel Injector Cleaner

Being a neophyte with a wasserboxer engine I am looking for opinion on fuel
injector cleaner.  The archives have several messages endorsing the use of
FI cleaner.

What is the conventional wisdom on this product (brand, frequency of
use,caveats)?
Does anyone out there recommend against using it?
Do any fuels, such as premium, contain it already?
