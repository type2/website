Subject: CV joint going?

Going over mountain summit passes in my &quot;84 Vanagon GL, the auto transmission &quot;kicked down&quot; into 2nd, 
then 1st on several steep climbs.

A few times, I heard what sounded like a piece of gravel wedged in the tire treads, clicking at slow 
speeds with each tire revolution, except it sounded more like a metal click than gravel.

Is this the sound associated with a worn CV joint?

If so, is the best fix to replace the CV joint with a new one?

In the archives, I believe, someone wrote that they flip their CV's/drive shaft, reversing the outer CV 
to inner (final drive) position, to entend the life of their CV's. Is this recommended?

In the &quot;Keep Your VW Alive&quot; manual, a procedure for dismantling the CV's and checking for wear is 
described (clean parts in solvent and check for discoloration or wear marks on balls, cage, etc.).  Is 
this appropriate, possible on an &quot;84?

I've seen stacks of CV's/drive shafts at VW recycling yards. Are used CV's OK?

Thanks,

Scott Maurer

PS. I highly recommend a variety of hikes in Bryce Canyon National park, Utah, between Sunrise and 
Sunset Points.
