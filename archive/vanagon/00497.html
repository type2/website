okay ,,,,
was the 74 fi??? i didn;t think so ..... it will fit but you will have to do 
some conversions on the gas tank and the put a high pressure fuel pump into teh
thing.... and make sure that you keep a 79 pressuer plate and clutch with 
whatever year of engine you are hooking up to.... the clutcyh and pressure 
plate stay with the tranny and will be put onto the engine that will be put 
onto that trannty..... and you will also have to change the brain and lots of 
other electrical parts to fit all that ...

good luck...
