Subject: Re: Heater fan replacment description requested.

Oops, forgot this in my last post. Replacement high security screws are
VW-only, as far as I know, but only $4.00 per (cheap for a dealer part). 
They are installed with an allen wrench, and torqued till the head comes
off.  They also can be replaced by a regular old hex bolt for the
non-security conscious.

&gt; &gt; Oh, yea, the black plastic that the heater/fan box is made out of tends to
&gt; &gt; be really brittle (I mean REALLY BRITTLE) so watch how you tighten those
&gt; &gt; screws back up.
&gt; 
&gt; Um, Dean, so are you gonna tell us where to get the replacement screws that
&gt; you drilled out and how to put them in or are we to be left in suspense with
&gt; the Chilton stand by 'installation is the reverse of removal'?  ;)
