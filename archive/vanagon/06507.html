&gt;&gt;Thom sucks up by typing:
&gt;&gt;&gt;Man, does _everybody_ owe Joel or what?  I know I do...
&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm confused as a baby in a topless bar.
&gt;
&gt;Awwww JeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEeeeeeezzzz Thom... will you quit feeding into
&gt;Joel's ego! I can see it now...Fridays will degenerate into two

ahem. i'll have you know that my Ego doesn't require feeding ... it is self
sustaining (although very confused). ;)

&gt;Yep, Godfather Joel (with tissues in his cheeks and all)...

those are NOT tissues!!! and just exactly WHICH cheeks are you talking about?

&gt;&quot;You never gave me or my Vanagon respect...or even asked me
&gt;to your garage for a quart of oil....and now you are asking
&gt;me for help on the day of the purchase of a used Vanagon??&quot;

so what's the problem? :)

&gt;I know why Joel has a couple of old Double Cabs floating around..
&gt;he made the owner an offer he could not refuse!!!

well ... i do admit to mentioning casually about the many terrible things

&gt;add one other thing...perhaps GODfather is a bit much...
&gt;maybe we could call him the VANfather...

i would prefer the Grand Magnolia Mufti Maharishi ala Babble von Hannover.
it's easier to remember.

&gt;Thats it..yep...I don't want to say anymore so I don't wake
&gt;up with the front end of my EuroVan cut off and lying in
&gt;bed next to me!!!

too late. i got my issue of Funkengroovin ... now i know what you look like.
for this (and many others), you must pay ... next year, you sleep with the
cv-joints!

profit of olde, and part-time GMMMaBvH.
