Subject: Re: Would you fix if it yourself (if you were me?)


&gt;&gt; 2.      seeping (seaping?) fuel line #3 ($22.00 parts, 78.00 labor)
&gt;&gt;         Q: Not yet leaking, but at this point seeping.

FIX IT NOW!!!


gas fumes + heat source (e.g. alternator spark) = boom.
my 85 GL burned in my driveway last December.   it was &quot;only&quot; seeping.
thank goodness for fire extinguishers.  rewiring, &amp; replumbing my '85 was a
good experience but i wouldn't wish it on anyone -- please learn from my
experience lest you be forced to learn on your own.


whatever it takes --  do it yourself or pay to have it done _but_ DO IT!
muy pronto! do it today.
do not pass go, do not collect $200 until you've got this repair done.
take out a 2nd on the house it that's what it takes. but do it!

i'm a stubborn do-it-yourselfer but if this repair waits even 1 one
dayextra while self confidence builds it's one day too many -- get it done
today or the next do-it-yourself project you contemplate may be a fire
salvage/rebuild.

any doubt how i think on this one?

I love the smell of napalm in the morning.

later,
dwight
