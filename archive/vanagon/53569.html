&gt; My 91 Vanagon  blew its head gaskets today....
&gt; 
&gt; I first lost the waterpump/alternator belt on the Hi-way.
&gt; After replace the belts, I forgot to replenish the unserviceable water
&gt; tank ..(all of the coolant was in the reserve tank and I thought it
&gt; would get sucked back into the football shaped one..
&gt; 
&gt; Well after 4miles on the new belts the oil alarm came on...the water
&gt; light too..lots of smoke...and a tow home...
&gt; 
&gt; I filled up the internal coolant tank at home and started it up....all
&gt; of the coolant comming out of the head gaskets....
&gt; 
&gt; My guess is the gaskets got burned up from the heat...I hope there is no
&gt; other internal damage...the oil dip stick is still at the same level...
&gt; 
&gt; Does any one know the cost of new head gaskets ....
&gt; also if I bring it into a shop what is a usual cost to replace the
&gt; gaskets?
&gt; 
&gt; THANKS JOHN...
&gt; PS..something happens everytime at CHRISTMAS when Im on the way to
&gt; disney with my kids.
I had the head gaskets replaced on my 91 Vanagon last month.  It cost
$1200 at a VW dealership in KC.
Good Luck
Jud
