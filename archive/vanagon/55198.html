Subject: Re: Ques: squeak under passenger seat.


Conditions of squeak under front passenger seat:
        Squeak seems to be inside, directly under seat, when bus is in motion.
        Does not occur when bus is stopped, or when someone sits in seat.
        -Intermittent, and somewaht related to the road condition.

        It does not seem to come *from* the seat,
                 more from the &quot;box&quot; under the seat.

        Thanks.

&gt;
&gt;     It would help if you provided a little more information.
&gt;
&gt;     What are the conditions under which you hear the squeak?  Is the
&gt;     squeak inside or outside the van?  Does the squeak occur when the van
&gt;     is stopped or moving?  When going over bumps?  Is it constant or
&gt;     intermittent?
&gt;

&gt;There is a pronounced squeak emanating from under the front passenger seat
&gt;|on 89 Westy. Squeaks regardless of whether or not a passenger is seated.
&gt;Any suggestions?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks.
