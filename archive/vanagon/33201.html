Subject: Sunroof drains

I probably belong in the idiot files, after having a cold bucket of water 
poured down the back of my neck more than once... from clogged sunroof 
drains. My sunroof recesses fill with water (at $120, the new seal didn't 
help) and I get the shower when I stop or head down hill.

Anyone know where these drains are, and can I blow compressed air through 
them (or use a wire), and which direction to blow the air as not to compact 
the problem??
