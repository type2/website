Subject: Re: [T2] Ponderous motor thoughts...

In a message dated 96-03-12 00:52:24 EST, you write:

&gt;I thought his was a Type 2! Why does it say [T2] at the top? Is there
&gt;something going on I don't know about again?
&gt;
&gt;--Ken
&gt;  '71 Bus, '68 Westy

Yes, Ken. 
T1 refers to a split windshield microbus
T2 refers to a breadloaf bus
T3 refers to a Vanagon style vehicle
T4 refers to the Eurovan (EV)

Once these labels are clear to someone, it makes the identification of which
vehicle you're talking about understandable. 

 So, does any body out there know that I am looking for a T3 Crewcab
Transporter?  I only have a primo '82 7-pass for trade.  A/C, fresh motor,
fresh tranny, blue velour int., two-tone factory blue paint. 

 I also have a friend that is looking for a T3 Westy H2O preferably with
power steering,  automatic a plus, A/C a plus, no rust a definite plus.  He
has no computer so call him at (803) 689-5884 South Carolina after 4 pm. He
will travel for the right camper and he has cash in hand.  If you have no
phone (and I don't believe you) his address is 21 Herring Gull,  Hilton Head
Is., SC 29926.  His name is Nick Luciano.
