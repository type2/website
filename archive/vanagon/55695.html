Subject: Found &amp; Bought Family Van!

Hello all,
	Thanks to everybody for all your advice.  I didn't go for that 
'86 upon some of your suggestions.
	But we found and bought a beautiful '88  Blue Wolfsburg with 
power everything.  It was miles ahead of the '86.  It has no camper and 
no pop top.  Remember we're having all that stuff put in ourselves 
through that country homes camper place.  Anyway, 93,000 miles, excellent 
condition, paid $7200.
	Anyway, thought you all would be interested in a new VW owner.
Comments anyone?

Thanks again everyone

Thad
