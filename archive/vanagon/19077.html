So Martha Rubin says:
&gt; 
&gt; There's a new newsgroup that may interest some of you:
&gt; 
&gt; rec.outdoors.rv-travel
&gt; 
&gt; Then, of course, there's always the old 
&gt; 
&gt; alt.rv
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone know of others that might be of interest to the camping-inclined?

There used to be one called rec_dot_camping, but I don't get it on my current
news server.  Wasn't much traffic at the time, but it may have grown since
I last read it.
