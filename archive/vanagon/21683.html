Subject: Re: Tire question again


&gt;QUESTION: Can I put passenger tires on it that are 4 ply? Or do I need to
get reinforced tires?

Well I put passenger tires on mine before reading the info on the list. They
are Goodyear Arivas (205/70R14). They work ok but I would say they feel real
squishy compared to the Michilens that were on there before. I have logged
about 14,000 miles on them without incident, but would feel better cornering
with a tire with a stiffer sidewall, so they will probably get moved over to
my Thing if I have the clearance in the front. My recommendation is to go
with the light truck rated tires, afterall your vanagon is a light truck
(almost 5000 lbs). I will be switching tires before winter.
