Subject: Bouncy gas gauge in '71 Van??

Hey yall,

Well, after leaving the parking lights on in the van for, oh, about 5 days,
the battery kinda went dead. Is this normal?  :^)  (Yup, Im a bonehead)

On another note, I have noticed that the gas gauge on my '71 van bounces
every time I hit a bump or pothole. I thought that if the gauge mooved too much,
it might cause funny things to happen. One guy told me that the wiper in the
tank could cause a spark, blowing me to kingdom-come. Baaad, maaan.

So, is this normal operation?  The beetle I had did not do this. I thought
that mabye I should have a big capacitor hooked up in parallel to lessen the
swinging needle, but that seems like it would be more spark prone.

So, in the short, is this normal? (I love to be normal, how can ANYBODY be 
different? It's just so difficult, all that originality.)
