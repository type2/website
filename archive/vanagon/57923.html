&gt;After collecting methods, hints, tips and techniques for starting the

&gt;who offered advice.
&gt;
&gt;Last night I went out in the dark and tried starting the fridge again.  In
&gt;addition to not getting any &quot;ticking&quot; noise from the ignitor or any light,
&gt;steady or flashing, from the indicator lights, I didn't see any light
&gt;through the &quot;view hole&quot; in the lower left corner of the fridge.  I thought
&gt;for sure I would see something in the darkness.
&gt;
&gt;Yes the fridge works on battery and A/C.  I have tried pumping the air pump
&gt;to death.  I also had compresses air blown through the drain hole. I
&gt;checked the two fuses for the kitchen, both are ok.
&gt;
&gt;Is there any way to test the piezo without removing the fridge?
&gt;
&gt;Any help, next steps, oversights, possible tricks are welcome.

My fridge doesn't want to start normally either.  I have a trick, however.
I run it on 'battery' (with the engine running) for about 15 minutes.  This
seems to do something, because afterwards it's fairly easy to start the gas.
