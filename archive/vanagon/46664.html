Subject: Oy!, the Pharoh's Wives! (fri~f)

In a private reponse regearding the artwork (of mine on M. Heron's page) I
was going off on the prospects of &quot;Resto Projects Through the Ages.&quot; Can any
of us imagine what the Pharoh's wives musta been like?

&quot;Oy, Tut! Are ya really gunna start another pyramid? Oy! you promised that
you'd stop after the other one. Oh Gawd! ya killink me!!! You know you
promised me that after you sold the other one that that would be it! You
promised that we'd start saving for the future! Vat about the shildren's
education unt our retirement!!!!? My got! I'm goink to have a heart attach
one a these days_at_!
Tut calmly responds, &quot;Now dear you have to admit that I have made a handy
profit on the others. Just TRUST ME, we won't get stuck with this one. We
might have to put a couple of bucks in it to make it sale-able but hey we
always get out of them OK, now dont we. 
(Famous last words:) 
&quot;I promise this will be the last pyramiad!&quot; (fingers crossed until the
hormones subside). ;-)

Tut's embattled wife replies, &quot;Oh OK, with all of these (damned) deals I
never can keep up with what you are up to!...
(Tut only smiles, realizing that he has her where he wants her....)

BTW:Too many &quot;Red Hooks ESB's&quot; I suspect! ;-)
