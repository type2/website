Subject: Re: 86 head retorquing?

&gt;On Mon, 3 Jun 1996 18:03:32 -0500 you said:
&gt;&gt;I was having a conversation with a friend and we were discussing if it is
&gt;&gt;advisable to retorque the heads on a wasserboxer 2.1. I have heard that it
&gt;&gt;is not necessary, like it is on a bug engine, but considering the head
&gt;
&gt;there was a recall on that when 86's were new. but it should have been done
&gt;to your bus waaaaay before now. it's probable that you don't &quot;need&quot; to do it.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I guess I didn't totally explain. I have just installed new heads. I was
thinking about a few thousand miles down the road after the new heads were
installed.
