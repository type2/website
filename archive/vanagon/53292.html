&gt;Hey all,
&gt;I have a quick question about lighting. 
&gt;
&gt;What I want is brighter lights for the brake light .....

 and to have brake lights that say &quot;I'm stopping&gt;NOW, dammit!&quot;  Should I go
for these halogen dealies?  Anyone have them on
&gt;their van?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance,

You want attention - getting???  I installed a third brake light at the top
of the rear window, &amp; installed a blue dot lens in the center of the red
lens; looks really hokey, but it's bright, attention-getting purple from
behind, &amp; vehicles 3-4 back know when I'm stopping.  I also installed an
adjustable vacuum switch that triggers the brake lights on deceleration, but
not at idle.  Kind of trickey to adjust-sometimes it engages between
upshifts, but people behind know when I'm slowing down even if I don't hit
the brakes.
