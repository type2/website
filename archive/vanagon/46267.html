&gt;&gt; If they think that the Jetta Trek thing is a good concept, why not a Westy
&gt;&gt; Trek?  Or better yet a Synchro Westy Trek!    
&gt;Good point - I was at the dealer a while back around the time we were 
&gt;shopping for mtn bikes - the Jetta Trek came in at $17900 CDN, which 
&gt;seemed like a great deal, since many of the other Jettas loaded up 
&gt;were well over $20K (the VR6 is about $30k). I would never buy a new 
&gt;car again, but I was surprised at the good value in this package, 
&gt;comparitively anyway.
&gt;
&gt;A Westy Trek is a natural - around here a bus *without* a bike rack is 
&gt;a rare sight...
&gt;The Trek idea is a step in the right direction, but could be easily 
&gt;copied by H*nda or anyone else. Now let's see someone copy a Westy 
&gt;Syncro Trek...
