Subject: propane fill valve 85 westy


well, i put the rebuild kit ($4.20) into the auto-shutoff valve (westy'85) ..
had to drill out the old screws.. yuk.

put it all together, no leaks, now works fine.  rebuild kit is easy,
if your screws are not rusted in place.  

it would be a good idea to keep a drop of lube on yall's cover plate screws, 
just in case you need to service your valve one day.

cooking with gas ..
