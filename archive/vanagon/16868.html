Subject: Re: Greasy Mess

&gt;VWers,
&gt;
&gt;Made it trough my first experience greasing the wheel
&gt;bearing and CV joints in the rear of my '75 bus.  All-in-
&gt;all it went well but it took a looong time to complete (3
&gt;days and about 25 hours of work).
&gt;
&gt;The first thing I did was collect the parts and tools:
&gt; 9.09ea CV boot kits: 12pt star bolts,grease,circlips (qt 4)

One question:
Where did you aquire these for only 9 bucks ea?
Local or through a mag?

I'll be doing the same procedure next week- thanks for the info.

BTW- I think the fronts are a whole lot easier.

Also- did y'll know that the disk brakes on VW's are made by the same 
company which supplies Mercades Benz?  Yup, the brakes on my 76 Benz were 
almost exactly like the ones on my 71.  Stop real well.
