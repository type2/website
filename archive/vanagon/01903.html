Subject: getting the drums off.

:::::actually from David at sun.

pull the two 10 mm bolts and bang the hell out of them with either a rubber
malley or (better) a 2 lb steel hammer with a piece of sacrificial 
lumber (2X4 works well) in between. 

If you can, back off the adjusters as far as possible (my guess is if the
drums are stuck so are the adjusters, however   :-(

No, use a gear puller to pull it off. This is what the Bently manual sez for
my 84 vanagon. A cheap $5 pulled did it for me. Thread the bolts back in and
pull from the bolts.

Go to a public library and look for a Bently vanagon manual. It has apicture
of a drum being pulled by a puller. Well, the puleer on the picturer is not
a cheap one. But, I know you quys can counterfeit one for $5 and it does work.

Good luck.

David
