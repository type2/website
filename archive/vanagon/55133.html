I would hate to put a rotary engine in a bus.  NO TORQUE!

Otherwise, great engine.  Reliable and easy to maintain.

&gt;Hi, a friend of mine asked me to post this to the list in light of the current
&gt;vanagon engine alternative thread.
&gt;
&gt;he has a Mazda RX-7 he's selling for $500.  Obviously, it has the Wankel rotary
&gt;engine. I know Kennedy makes an adapter to use this engine in the Beetle (I'm
&gt;serious!) so I'm sure they make an adapter to put it in the Vanagon. 
&gt;
&gt;e-mail him for specifics.
