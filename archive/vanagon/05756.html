Subject:  Dealer offers 10K for 91 Carat with 11.8K book value....is it a rip....

A ford Dealer offered me 10K for my 91 Vanagon Carat that has a wholesale
blue book value of 11.8K...Are they trying to rip me off?? They say that there
is not a market for VW Vanagons...and didnot believe that the blue book value
is realistic....(my van is in good shape).....Does anybody have any advice??
