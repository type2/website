Rusty suggests:
Downtown Oakland?, The &quot;Tenderloin&quot;?, Golden Gate Park?, Berkley's Frat
Row?, Mill's College for Girls? *Been there, done...* 1977;););), Phoenix
Bug-O-Rama? Nov 3,4,5? Now, what do you think seems to be the best option
(besides Mills)?

&gt;Due to untimely schedule conflicts for a number of our members, leaving
&gt;so few of us to go camping, I move that we postpone this weekend's
&gt;camping trip.
&gt;In the meantime, since I was raring to go camping, I'm sort of
&gt;thinking it would be fun to do maybe a one nighter this weekend
&gt;somewhere locally near the bay area.  Any takers?
