Subject: Re: Westies w/ ATs

Well I have an '80 with an AT.  It has 100K+ miles on it.  The engine has 
been replaced at least once before I got it.  But the transmissions appears 
to be the original with no work done to it other than an occasional fluid 
change.  The AT works well.  I don't have any real complaints.  I would 
agree that acceleration is quite as good as a stick but I can drink my 
coffee and drive at the same time :)

It also shifts better than my Ford Probe which has an automatic in it also.
