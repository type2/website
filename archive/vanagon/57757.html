Subject: 85 Tune-up

I performed a tune on on my van last week and would like to know if I
missed any parts. We are planning tons of camping trips this summer
including spending the whole month of August in Alaska!

Parts Changed

* cap &amp; rotor                           * oxygen sensor
* spark plugs &quot;bosh&quot;                    * changed oil in manual trans
* wire's                                * K&amp;N air filter
* fuel filter                           * Rad flush
* water pump belt


Did I miss anything?
