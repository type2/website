&lt;&lt; HI guys, posted this last week and thought I'd give it one last try before
 I give it up to a junkyard.  I have an 84 Vanagon GL suspect of a blown head
 gasket that needs a good home before I move to the mountains.  I'm in
 Raleigh, NC and I'll let it go for $200 dollars to whomever can come get it.
 Interior is nice and the body is in pretty good shape(needs a bath though).
 Please reply to me directly as I'm off the list now.peace!

too bad I'm not in NC....great deal tho... if the tranny's good, that alone
is worth more than the $200......
