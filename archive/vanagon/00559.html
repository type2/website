Subject: Re-covering seats in a Bus


We just re-stuffed and re-covered the seats in my '76 Bus.
The results were fantastic!

I was going to post a summary but I stopped typing after
about 3 pages :-).  If anyone has any questions about this,
let me know and I'd be glad to answer them.  This is a summary
of what we did:

1. Removed and disassembled rear bench seats and front seats.
2. Un-stapled fabric from rear seats, and un-glued and un-tacked
   material from the front seats.  Kept everything intact so we
   could make patterns out of it.
3. Went to the fabric store and got about 7 yards (which was about
   2 yards too much) of outrageous plaid upholstery material as well
   as about 3 yards of black cotton/poly material.  Also got 12 feet
   of 1&quot; think foam padding.
4. Got a staple gun and hot glue gun.
5. Cut material based on patterns from old material.  Sewed rear
   seats (easy, 4 seams per pad).  Sewed front seats (not so easy,
   base was 4 pieces, top was 2).  Checked for fit and reinforced
   all seams.
6. Stapled material onto rear seats, pulling tight for a good fit
   but leaving room for mounting brackets.
7. Repaired padding on front seats.  Taped the horsehair and foam
   back together with gaffer's tape, being sure to cover all exposed
   wired and frame.  Put a layer of 1&quot; foam on each base with enough
   to overlap all around the sides to cover everything.  Added some
   scrap foam to the driver's seat for added support.
8. Slipped front covers on.  The base glued on and required a few
   hand stitches.  The top just tacked onto the seat with little
   bend-out spikes and also required a few hand stiches.

The results look professional!  I'm tellin' ya.

Note that there was an article in the latest Volks World
(that british mag) about re-covering seats in the older
Beetles.
