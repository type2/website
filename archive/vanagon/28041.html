Subject: Anyone got a splittie shell FS?

Hi all,
	I'm just gonna throw this out there on the off-chance that 
someone can help me.  The story is that I've got a mostly complete '66 
Westy with a rusty body and floors.  I was just wondering if anyone has 
or knows of a stripped, rust-free (relatively) split-window which I could 
switch all of my parts into.  I'm kinda scared to start doing body work 
and I can't afford to have anyone else do it.  I'd be willing to pay a 
reasonable amount or maybe trade stuff ('73 Squareback? '73 Bus/Camper 
(Maybe)).  Anyway, let me know if you got anything.  You see I had a 
dream last night where someone sold me a mint shell and I thought it 
would be really cool.  Howabout someone's discarded project?
Thanks,

-Erik.
