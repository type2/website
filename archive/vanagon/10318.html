&gt;  I got a question.  It is my understanding that a &quot;Microbus&quot; is only that bus
&gt;which has the dulux package(chrome, clock, ect.), moon windows and a rag top.
&gt;All other splits are classified as Kombi, Pickup, Panel, Camper. Is your list
&gt;calling all &lt;68 busses, micorbusses?

well, you caught me. :)  i suppose the Correct Terminology would be T1, T2,
T3, and T4, but everybody gets confused about the differences between T2 and
Type 2 ... so i just settled on the 'common' names. and Microbus means any
vw transporter/bus model from 1949 to 1967. Bus means 1968 to 1979 (even the
pickups). Vanagon is 1980-1991, and Eurovan is 1992 to whenever.

even this causes problems: Eurovans are called Transporters everywhere else
and were made in 1991 ... but i haven't bothered to allow the program to
handle BOTH vanagons (which, by the way, is also a north-american-only name)
AND eurovans of 1991. besides, it would mess up my nice neat columns. :)

so if you have some sort of vw transporter/bus/camper/pickup/panel/shoebox
made from 1949 to 1967, you is a Microbus. :p
