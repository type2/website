Hey Now!

Well I've joined the ranks of the Wasserboxers.  Not having owned a gasoline
vehicle since 1980, this new electronic fuel injection stuff should be a kick
in the butt.  After much debating about what to do about Billy-Rae's ('82
Diesel) inability to hit the Interstate speed limit, we held our breath and
took the plunge!  First thing I noticed about the new rig was the power! 
Going from 48 horses  to 95 horses certainly was a pleasent surprise.  I had
no idea how &quot;fast&quot; one of these boxes could go.

So we bought a '87 GL Weekender (125k) with new heads.  We feel we got a good
deal at $3,500.  Not having worked on or driven gasoline in 16 years I have
some questions about the way the van drives.

1.  Why do the RPMs stay at 2,000 between shifts?

2.  The tempature gauge stays low, barely out of the &quot;white area&quot; on the low
side.  In stop and go traffic it goes up to just beyond the red light and I
hear the fan come on.  Otherwise it stays low.  If I were to replace the
thermostat what temperature should I ask for?  Is the fan coming on at the
right temperature?  Where should the temperature needle be under normal
conditions?

3.  I understand the FI uses sensors to adjust fuel delivery.  What do they
sense, temperature? air density? Could someone lay out the sensors and tell
me what each one does?

4.  What would create a slight flat spot (hesitation) during accelleration
after a shift?

5. Is there a good fuel injection reference manual you'd recommend?

Thank god Bentley covers both Gas and Diesel motors.

Thanks in advance!
