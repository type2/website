Subject: photocopies of torsion bar adjustment article


I've had a few requests for photocopies of the Hot Dune Buggies and VWs
article on torsion bar adjustment. But I haven't got any snail-mail addresses!
So... if you want copies, give me your address, I won't sign you up on any
cult mailing list, or start doing credit checks, but I will include, at no
extra charge, the only other article I have from the same series -
Interior restoration. I found the articles to be inspiring if a little
short on comprehensiveness (is that really a word?).
There is a description, BTW, of torsion bar adjustment in the old Bentley
manual, I could be persuaded to copy that also.

Alistair, no I'm not moving to Tuscaloosa
