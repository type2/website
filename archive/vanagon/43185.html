Subject: 84 exhaust prices



In researching the price of a replacement exhaust pipe for my 84 I came
accross a wide range of prices and some contradictory information. VW
want something like $300 for these pipes, other places sell them anything
from about $80 (Parts Place I think) upwards.  However I am told that
the VW replacements are Stainless Steel and I know that the $80 pipes
sold by PP are steel (or so the guy said - he also said the the original parts
are steel also???).  Certainly the Midas engineer who welded two holes
in my pipe ($25) said it was stainless.  Anyway, the moral is that you
might get what you pay for.
