Just randomly thinking of questions for the Type II lists.

What are the load ratings for older busses, and older single and crew 
cabs in particular?
Well, I also own a genuine hunk of Detroit steel, and was curious about 
it's load capacity versus VW's.
I have a 1964 Ford F-100 Crewcab (special order from Ford) that is a 
1/2 ton. &lt;they didn't make crewcabs until '66&gt;
My Vanagon is load rated at 1 ton.
Interesting that a standard Vanagon has twice the load rating.
