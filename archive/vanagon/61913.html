Subject: gauges for a Vanagon
Date: Wed, 25 Jun 1997 19:58:51 -0400

Hey all,
I'm looking at putting at least two gauges in my '81, oil temperature and
oil pressure.  Maybe a voltmeter thrown in there for good measure or just
'cause I like gauges.  I would get a tach but they are MUCHO expensive.  

Anyway, the problem with the Vanagon dash is that there's not any good
place to put extra gauges.  I could put them to the right of the radio, but
then they're out of my line of sight.  I'm thinking of one of the 2 or 3
gauge clusters that RMMW sells mounted on top of the dash, over the speaker
grille so I can still use my ashtray (I don't smoke but it makes a handy
change holder).  How do those gauge pods typically mount?  Screws? 
Adhesive?  

Also, I'd like to get VDO gauges but I want to get them from somewhere that
has better prices than Motorworks.  Buying all my gauges and senders and
pods from RMMW would break the bank.  Who's got good prices on VDO gauges
and senders?  Bus Boys?  Bus Depot?  Volks Cafe??

Regarding the oil pressure gauge, I see two offered in the RMMW catalog,
one that goes to 80 psi and one that goes to 150.  Which one should I get? 
How high does the oil pressure in the VW engine get, anyway?

I've done the oil temp gauge install before, so I don't need help with that
but I'm new to oil pressure gauges.  I know I will need a sender that will
let me keep the stock oil light and some kind of adapter to clear the tin
on the Type 4 engine.  Any ideas here?  

I know I will hear from David Schwarze on this :-) .  Let me hear that
gauge wisdom, oh gauge god!!  You guys should see Dave's dashboard :-)

Could I locate the gauge cluster from a junked Rabbit and use those gauges?

Any and all help is appreciated.  This installation probably won't happen
for a little while anyway, but it's one of those things that I want to get
done soon.  Just need money :-)

Then there's the aux. battery -- that'll be fun to work out.....

Thanks folks,
Sean
