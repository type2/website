Subject: HELP!!  problems with an '87

ALL,

Need some help.  My '87 Vanagon has developed a problem I can't seem to track
down.  Most of the time it runs wonderful....as long as you don't shut it
off.  It does have an ocasional ever-so-slight &quot;hiccup&quot; for no apparent
reason.  

BUT, if you turn the damn thing off and come back shortly thereafter, like
going shopping or in todays case out to lunch, and come back it will run for
a while (2 - 20 minutes, whenever IT decides) then just completely die.  No
coughing or bucking, etc.  Just complete and instant death.  It cranks strong
at that point but won't kick over.  Let it sit for a while and it will start
up, run for a while, and die again.  (Repeat process until you are back to
work LATE from lunch and totally frustrated.)

Anyway, in short, starts up fine first try every morning. (6 - 7am) Runs fine
all the way to work.  Leave for lunch (11am) runs fine.  Return to work
(11:30) runs terrible.
Appears problem only happens when engine is warm and restarted.  Appears to
be electrical (sudden death) and not fuel related (no coughing, bucking,
etc.)  Of course I could be totally wrong...

Does anyone have a clue as to what is going on here?  HELP!!!!!

Please reply direct and to the list.

Thanks,
Dan
