Subject: Re: Help with my Splitty steering boxe

&gt;     I need to adjust the steering on my '64 Split. So I go to undo the 
&gt;     adjusting screw and it's pretty tight. So I thought that I didn't want 
&gt;     to strip the thread coz the casing's only Aluminium.

I thinkyou should try some liquid wrench or similar stuff on it.  I tried to
take a box apart one time, can't remember why, but the project didn't go so
well.
