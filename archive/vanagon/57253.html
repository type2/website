Subject: RE: 87 Syncro CV Joint/ Spares List

&gt; In fact, how about generating a cross referenced parts list for the
&gt; Vanagons, something to go into Coyotes FAQ site.  Nice to know that a fuel
&gt; pump from a ???? will work in a Vanagons etc.  Sort of list that I'd like
&gt; with me heading of into the great unknown.  Perhaps the vendors who grace
&gt; this list could put this together from their catalogues/sources?

You know that these lists altready exist, does anybody have a friend 
with a junkyard?  They have monstrous books cross-referenceing most 
any parts mechanical, drivetrain, engine, and electrical for nearly 
all cars.  They can tell you f.i. that a '86 Quantum Syncro rear 
caliper is the same as a front Audi 4000 such and such (no shit I did 
that once).  So if anybody knew somebody, it would be fairly trivial 
to copy a couple pages of Vanagon/Bus cross referencing.
