Subject: RE: SE Meeting

What about Ashville?  I'm in Chattanooga but Winston-Salem is probably not 
impossible.  The Thing meet is in Ashville around the last of June or first of 
July.  I took the bus (Thing needed major rust repair) to that event last July 
and the mountains caused major heat stress on the aged engine but we made it 
o.k.

New to the list but not to busses or old Volks in general,

Chattanooga, Tn.
