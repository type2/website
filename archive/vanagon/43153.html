Subject: that free van

        I'll be sure to take a photo of the van and I'll let you all know
when Ive got it on the ol computer incase youd like to take a peek at it. I
discovered that the artist who is going to be doing the graphics on it is
the guy who did my tattoo. He's an amazing guy so Id expect nothing less
than genius from him.
        If you were to drive a hemp graphic ladden VW around here I dont
think anyone would really care, and you would not have to fear getting
checked out by the cops all the time. Things are becoming more and more
relaxed in regards to that sort of thing. 3 Marijuana shops selling goods,
clothes, books, bongs, pipes and whatnot have opened within the past 4
months here inedmonton. We've had numerous rallies which ive helped
organize and I see things only getting better. Even our respected city
paper has started printing more an more articles in regards to the war on
marijuana.

        I realize this is unrelated to VW all that much and I apologize if
any of you take offence to this sort of post but I had to get my $0.02 in.

thanks
