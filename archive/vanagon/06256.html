Subject: Pix on the Vanagon WWW server


Tim Coutreau sent me some pix and Luke Hassel sent me some pix pointers for
the Van server recently.  I took the opportunity to add a simple images
page.  Check it out at

I can still use formatting help with some of the documents.  (I received one
formatted doc - a typed-in section from the Synchro user's manual - but
haven't installed it yet. I haven't had the chance to format it, and I'm
hesitant to install copyrighted material on the server without a release
from the publisher - VW in this case.)
