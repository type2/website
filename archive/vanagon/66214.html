Subject:      Re: 2.8 liter vanagon engine swap

for the wiring harness and all, what i'm doing is getting a non
computerized engine and then getting a separate guage cluster for the
essentials(h2o temp, oil temp, fuel press, voltmeter) and a separate
tachometer.  for the speedo, fuel level, and all the other guages and
&quot;idiot&quot;-lights that are on the Vanagon dashboard, i am going to try to
connect everything.
