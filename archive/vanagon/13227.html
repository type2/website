&gt;but don't you just love the ones that fly up beside you, then finally pass,
&gt;then slow down!!!!???   :)

The ones that get me are the guys/gals who can't stand to be behind that 
slow microbus in the right lane, so they whip around me, only to make a 
right turn half a block later.  Why can't people wait a minute if they
know they're gonna be turning off anyway?
