&gt; Well, I was thinking vacuum cleaner hose(s) running up the middle of the
&gt; ceiling with tie downs to hold it up temporarily.  Real fancy huh?  The 
&gt; connecting it to the a/c unit would be trick.  Maybe some specially molded
&gt; plastic to fit a couble of the vent holes?

My neighbor ('91 Westy Syncro, NOT a list member (no net link), but a
prime candidate!) did this exact thing - he used (small) vacuum hose
that ran from one of the AC outlets in the rear, along the shelf
(driver side) or door run (passenger side), to each of the front seats.
Works great, he says. He used velcro fasteners along the run from rear
to front so he could take the hoses off when not needed. I guess one
advantage of running up the sides is that you don't have to take the
hose off when you lift the roof.

I don't know what the attachment to the rear outlet was - I believe he
made a special adapter from plastic or something - I'll check next time
I see him.
