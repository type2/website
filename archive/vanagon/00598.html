Subject: Kombi...kombi....AGAIN!


After the great EuroVan vs Vanagon debate has died down, I figured
I'd raise an old thread again. I was browsing through my 1970 VW
Type II brochure and found the following quote:

	&quot;And if you want to save even more money you can choose our
less expensive model. The Kombi, our basic Station Wagon.

	It's just as roomy and comfortable but not as fancy. Standard 
seating is for five instead of seven. The upholstery isn't as plush. 
And it comes in solid rather than two-tone exteriors.&quot;

&gt;From this passage it would seem that the Kombi is the Type II equivalent
of the &quot;Standard&quot; Beetle (for those of you into numbers - Model 111).

It is also interesting that from 71 on the Kombi designation pretty
much disappeared from US literature.
