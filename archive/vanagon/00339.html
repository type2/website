&gt; What I see here is one of two things. The first VWUS is doing a piss-

&gt; the second, most of you are taking your positions in this &quot;discussion&quot;
&gt; with little or no factual or actual EV experience. I will assume that
&gt; it is the former not the latter.

Actually, it has to be (by your meticulous data) both.

&gt; As to the &quot;minivan&quot; designation, we all know how RELIABLE Consumer
&gt; Reports is when it comes to VWs. 

Or anything.  I wasn't using that as a strict datapoint, just as a 
demonstration of the impression.

&gt; As Sgt. Friday used to say: &quot;Just the facts....&quot;

The facts are much appreciated! Thanks.
This is all moot to me as I'll never buy a new car, so the Eurovan is
about 10 years off for me.
