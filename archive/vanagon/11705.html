Howdy all,

maybe my 90GL is weird, or maybe it's just me, but I've never had an
overflow problem, and I don't have to hold the nozzle at an angle or
reduce the flow rate near the end.  Far more prevalent is the *$%_at_ pump
that wants to shut itself off every two seconds when the tank is nowhere
near full...
