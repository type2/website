Subject: RE: scooter car query



&gt;While at the Pescados fish taco vanagon/bus meet yesterday in Sacramento,
&gt;I got my first glimpse of something called a &quot;scooter car.&quot;  I only
&gt;saw it for a moment, but it was sorta like a motorcycle-sized thing,
&gt;but wrapped in a car body.  It had I think 2 wheels on the front,
&gt;and one on the back.

&gt;I'm fascinated!  Does anyone know anything about these cars?  When
&gt;and where made?  STill available?  Specs?  Success?  I'm told there
&gt;may even be some sort of scooter club, either on the 'net or off.

&gt;Anyway, any info you can give me I'll be very eager to get!

&gt;TIA,

&gt;/martha


I was in England and Europe in 1971, back when &quot;bigger was better&quot;
in America. The other side of the pond was a surprise-- a VW bug
was one of the larger cars you could find there!

I saw a few different varieties of three-wheeled cars-- some with
one front and two rear; some with two front and one rear. Smaller
was obviously better in Europe/England, since gas cost about $1.90
per gallon while it was $.30/gallon here (remember those days?).

There weren't a great number of three-wheelers there. OTOH, they
weren't considered unusual-- just small.

My $.02.
