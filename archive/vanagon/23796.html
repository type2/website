&gt;There have been reports of ALUMINUM Type I universal cases turning up

&gt;time to time.  If true, they will continue to turn up since they should last
&gt;just about forever.  All Type I, II and III cases were cast of a 
&gt;high-strength magnesium alloy that hardens and cracks after
&gt;experiencing x number of heat cycles.  The Type IV engine uses an aluminum
alloy
&gt;that does not have this unfortunate tendency.

How can you tell if a universal case is aluminum or magnesium (short of
trying to catch it on fire:-))?  I was wondering because I have one sitting
in my garage.  I really should sell it before I find something else to put
around it;-).  The wife would REALLY love that!
