Subject: Re: Broken antenna on 87 vanagon


&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately, I forgot to push the stock antenna down
&gt;first.... and it bent/broke in the process.
&gt;
&gt;Was wondering what options I have for replacements? Is it easy
&gt;to install a newer, flexible and higher powered one? How much $?
&gt;
I got my replacement antenna from the dealer. I like it a lot. You can put
it down all the way into the mast and use a special tool (like a little
slot screwdriver, really) to get it back out, which is nice for trips into
Philly.
It's also a solid antenna (looks like stainless?).
Of course, it costs 38.00 or so at the dealer.

Now, the secret: the Vanagon (or at least mine, an '87) takes the same
antenna as a Beetle. So, really, any Beetle antenna should work.

It _shouldn't_ have been hard to replace (for me). My old antenna unscrews
at the top of the base. I had to take the headlight out, and unscrew the
fuse panel. From there, I wiggled the old antenna out (can't remember
whether I took it out of the headlight or fuse panel area--I think it comes
out of the headlight socket) and put the new one in. I ran the wire the
same way as the old one, and only had to slide the radio out a bit, since I
used the ash tray hole to get to the wire and plug it into the back of the
radio.
EXCEPT, I had problems getting the old one out and gouged the antenna hole
a bit in the body. I had to touch it up and put a sealant there to make it
watertight. (This is important if you don't want rain dripping into your
fuse panel)
