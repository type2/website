&gt;Subject: RE (2): Forwarded: FS 60 Double Door

&gt;If no bids are forthcoming, e-mail the owner. Heck, e-mail
&gt;him anyway.  Maybe he'll tell you that he THINKS the parts
&gt;van is a '60, and that it has a funny big door in back.

&gt;Since I'm notawanna splittie, its up to someone else.

&gt;Tom F.
&gt;bunch of VAG stuff

I emailed him just to find out *where* the bus is.  No
response yet. I do not need another splittie, but...
