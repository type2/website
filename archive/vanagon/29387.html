&gt;  Check your cable out carefully by pulling off the lever knobs and the fan
&gt;knob.  Then pry off the cover plate by sliding to one side a bit.  I would
&gt;bet that your cable has broken off near the lever, about in front of your
&gt;face, where there is a sharp kink. Usually the wire has kinked itself
&gt;elsewhere from binding when you pushed, it breaks at the nice sharp kink VW
&gt;put in when they made it, hmmm...

You're right here, the break is the symptom not the cause.

&gt;          If you can see the culprit, you may be able to do a splice job,
&gt;small brass tube over both bits of 'cable' (actually a fat single steel
&gt;strand) get a good soldering iron, flux, and bleed the solder into the
&gt;joint, watch where it drips!  I have NOT done this please note.

The temp required to solder a sleeve on will damage the outer housing unless
you use sometype of clamp on heat sink.

&gt;  Or you may be able to rig a new cable end on using a piece of wire looped
&gt;through the lever and overlapping the existing bit.  Make a small clamp by
&gt;drilling a 1/8&quot; hole through a smallish bolt next to the head.  Stuff the
&gt;two new and one old bit of wire through the hole in opposite directions, add
&gt;a washer and nut, then tighten and you are done.  This is of course
&gt;adjustable.  I HAVE done this fix, it works fine.  Works on heater box
&gt;control flaps those those who heat with air and other gasses.

Good idea here. You might want to consider using two of these &quot;clamps&quot; so
that the cable does not buckle. I haven't looked at this too closely but I
am a little doubtful if there is enough room for either of these repairs
--boo hoo--.

&gt;        The $390 is four+ hours VW labour for dash re/re, it'll take you 6-8
&gt;&lt;g&gt; so figure on a weekend if you are going in.  Free advice, lube the
&gt;blower fan motor if you are in there, they seem to have around a 6-7 year
&gt;life before they start to howl. In fact lube everything you see that moves!!
&gt;Especially the heat control cables!

I would love to get $390/4hrs &lt;g&gt;. Do it yourself, you'll be proud when
you're done and if anything goes wrong again you can either fix it yourself
or be at more of advantage when dealing with &quot;professionals&quot;.

&gt;
&gt;Big, green, spelled B-E-N-T-L-E-Y,  takes a wad of green to purchase too,
&gt;$60-90, you have no other choice, and it will pay for itself, eg:$390&lt;g&gt;.

Great suggestion!!
