&gt;DON&quot;T INCLUDE THE WHOLE ORIGINAL MESSAGE WHEN YOU REPLY TO IT.

I agree. But at the same time, don't send just a bare reply with NO
quoting, unless you can fit all the relevant info into a few lines
of your reply. I've gotten messages from listmembers with no inclusion,
saying things like &quot;Your idea was OK, but I like the original better&quot;,
with no reference to what he/she meant; and I was left scratching my head.
