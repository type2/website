Subject: 88 Weekender FS


Well, Vanagon friends, I am on the horns of a dilemma.  My Weekender is getting 
a little older, and its been a while since the heads were done.  I was going
to sell or trade it, but since it is not a full camper, it does not have the
value of a Westy and is harder to sell.  

Now, my question is, should a person sell what they _REALLY_ like just
because it is &quot;time to let it go&quot; (before major problems - like the heads).
I was all ready to do this until I saw what I would get for a trade on
something really awful like an Aerostar or Caravan - or worse - the dreaded
Safari (where IS your left foot supposed to go in those?)

I thought my Vanagon was getting expensive to keep running. Then I talked to
my friend with a Caravan.  His monthyl cost of operation was - get this - DOUBLE
what my vanagon (I'm talking repairs and maintenance over a period of years)
has been.

I talked to my mechanic who tells me the automatics do not seems to give
much trouble, mostly just the head problem.

Then I talked to a wrecker who did the Legacy transplant with Kennedy's kit,
and the owner LOVES it.....SOOOOO, now I'm thinking sell my &quot;runner&quot;
(a trusty 84 Corolla), bank the money from it for the inevitable engine job,
run the Van until the engine goes, then invest in the Legacy swap and drive
and camp in the weekender for another 10 years.

Only  a Vanagon person would even consider this course of action. Everybody
else would say take whatever you can get for the van and keep the Toyota.

Well, it's a tough call for me.  I can't sleep in a Corolla, now can I?

Sigh...&quot;If I were a rich man...&quot;

Anybody out there done the Legacy swap (2.1 non-turbo)?

Ed
