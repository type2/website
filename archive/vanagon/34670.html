Subject: Re: brake fl leak


&gt;&gt; While on this subject, I thought I'd mention for all you
&gt;&gt; 68-72 bus people out there:  The plastic resevoir that sits
&gt;&gt; on the master cylinder is no longer available from the
&gt;&gt; dealer (but the master cylinder is, go figure) and no
&gt;&gt; aftermarket parts source that I'm aware of makes one.
&gt;
&gt;RMMW (Bus Stop) 1995 catalog lists a brake fluid reservoir
&gt;for '68-'72 buses at $28.75 (item # 87313).  I just &quot;happened&quot;
&gt;across it looking for '67 parts.


Hmmmm...

My '71 bus has TWO (count them, two) plastic brake fluid reservoirs.
One is behind the driver's seat, and looks kinda like the one that
was up against the front sheet metal in my old '69 bus. Is this the one
that RMMW has?

The other one, mounts directly on top of the master cylinder, by the
front axle, and is very odd-shaped. It's connected to the first (upper)
reservoir by a long hose. Anybody know if this second (odd-shaped) one,
is also available or not? It's probably unique to '71 and later busses,
since these had power front disc brakes ('70 and earlier had drums in
the US).
