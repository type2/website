Subject: Cooling Intake Air?
Date: Thu, 20 Jun 1996 16:28:35 -0700

        With all the talk of oil temps (ok, I started it : )), I was
thinking of ways to try and keep the intake air cool. IN my 77 I was
thinking that running some duct, like heater hose, from the air intake
around and up into the air scoops on the side of the bus would help the
engine run alittle cooler. Basically try and route the air intake away from
the engine compartment air, and closer to where the air actually comes in.

        Is there anything wrong with doing this? I would think it would
help by letting the system get cooler air into it, instead of the hotter
stagnant air in the compartment. If anyone has any info on this I'd love to
hear about it. I think I'm going to try it and see if it helps, unless I
hear from someone that I shouldn't do this for whatever reason. Thanks
alot!   Tom
