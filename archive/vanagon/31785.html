Subject: electrical problems...

Trying to get Lola in shape for inspection, I had to purchase a turn signal
switch.  I also had to construct a (wire) harness for the brake light
system, as the previous one was burnt to a crisp.  I made sure all
connections on the harness were ok with a battery /n buzzer hookup.

Everything I have rewired on Lola so far works...headlights, fan, emergency
flasher, etc.  The problem(s) I am having right now is:

1. Brake lights don't work. Fuse ok. Connections in front okay. Bulbs work.
2. Turn signal doeesn't work.  When I switch left or right, both lights in
dash come on, like the warning light.  Rear signals don't activate.

Obviously (or maybe not) the problems are related, but even after going
over the wiring diagram sixty times my brain is not functioning in a
logical manner.

I imagine I will find the problem sooner or later, but for now me stuck.
Any suggestions would be helpful...

Thanks for all of your help!

Regards,

J89
