&gt; It is not the foam blocks (or rack either for that matter) that gives
&gt;  stability. It is the tie downs. Place the canoe symmetrically
&gt;  length and crosswise between the front and back tiedowns, and firmly
&gt;  tie it down with a well tensioned line. Now any movement
&gt;  of the canoe will increase the tension in the lines =&gt; Stability!

Been using this method for about 15 years.  Works great.  Never lost a canoe,
nor had one slip.  Been doing it for the past 4 years on my 85 Westy.  Again
no problems.  Just took a 300 mile trip this past weekend this way without a
problem.  I use motorcyle tie down straps at the front and rear for holding
the canoe down.  3/8 inch nylon line crosswise across the body of the canoe
hooked to the rain gutters.
