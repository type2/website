John,
Thanks for the suggestions. I had been thinking about Lake Champlain, but
didn't know where specifically to go. I love Maritime Museums, so Button
Bay sounds great. We have a great mearitime museum here in SF, and a few
years ago I spent a couple days at Mystic Seaport, which was incredible.
Thanks again
