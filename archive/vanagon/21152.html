Subject: Cheap Interior Lights.

In a moment of enlightenment, I was thinking of wiring up a series/parallel
arrangement of  clear micro Christmas lights.  These little buggers sell for
$2US for 35 including the modifiable wiring.  They're 3-4vdc rated, so series
of 4 should give a reasonable approximation of 12v load.  Paralleling a 
suitable number of sets of these should give a sparkly illumination to 
the interior of one's bus of course you oughter remove the bimetallic blinker
bulb so you don't look like a giant firefly.

Of course I haven't done this yet but there's always tomorrow.
