Subject: Vanagon Door Handles

Vanagoneers:

Gregg's question about the driver-side anti-lock-out feature
of Vanagon doors (see Need some Stuff. thread) reminds me of
two problems with my '84 GL door handles.

1)  At both &quot;anchor points&quot; (front and back) of the door
handles, rust has started to creep out.  The rest of the
finish is in pretty good shape (even low welded joints) but
there is no question that I will have to pull the handles
for some body preparation and paint.  Anyone else with this
problem?  Is it just stress at those points, maybe
flexing/slipping from so much opening of the door over the
years?  The design is not all that different from earlier
buses.  Never had a problem on my '73 or the '67s.

2)  Black anodized finish is wearing off the driver door and
the cargo door handles.  Any other Vanagon owners experience
this?  Chrome finishes on earlier handles held up well if
properly maintained, but chrome never wore off!  Is there
any option short of stripping and reanodizing?
