just gonna add another 'me too' to the list.  i tried to drop the tank this
weekend but found that it required another hand or perhaps a little more
knowledge of just what was connected 'up there'.  this only occurs when the
tank is full, so it -must- be a connector to the expansion tanks or the fuel
sensors, right?  i'll try again next weekend and relay whatever info.
