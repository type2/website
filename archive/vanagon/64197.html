Subject:      Repost: my '91 GL for sale

1991 Vanagon GL, 4spd, Tornado Red..........$7500.00.  This Vanagon and my
'86 before this have been two of the greatest joys of my life. I know most
of you know the feeling.  I am not at all mechanically minded so I've
decided it's time to pass along my '91 to someone who is more capable of
providing care in those later Vanagon years.  I know it's ONLY a '91 but
it's seen a good deal of road.  I'm moving on to a Golf Trek (a Driver
FOUND).  Maintained with excellence (all records available).  131,500 miles
(50 highway miles a day to work and back, Western NY to Upper Michigan
twice a year, AND..........just returned from an 11,000 mile journey,
safely and flawlessly carrying my 20 y/o daughter (and friend) from Buffalo
to most everywhere out West, and back home).  Well almost flawlessly, it
seems the starter may need to be replaced.  Heads were replaced at around
95,000.
