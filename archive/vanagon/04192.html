Subject: new dogs, old tricks...

&gt;I must admit that I felt really cheezy listening to the Who's:
&gt;Magic Bus
&gt;and the Doors:
&gt;The End ( The blue bus, is calling us....)

	occasionally i get the fancy for Magic Carpet Ride when feeling
free and wild but more often than not it's Yellow Submarine (sunshine
yellow down to the rims) when feeling absurdly happy.

&gt;Note:  I have officially learned something from reading this group.  I now have
&gt;working reverse lights again, thanks to a post stating that the reverse lights
&gt;connect to the 12V side of the coil.  Whoooo-hooooo!

Whew.. i'm glad i'm not the only one that benefitted from that incredibly
simple solution to a mystifying problem... sometimes the most obvious
solutions are the hardest to find.  

under my hat,
