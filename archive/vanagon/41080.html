&gt;Hello All,
&gt;		I just got back from a weekend spent working on my new aquisition.  I 
&gt;haven't yet gotten any info on the camping equipment or the Bentley manual
so I have 
&gt;some questions if any of you have the answers. 
&gt;	My first problem deals with a small oil leak located around a plug like
object 
&gt;on the pan of the engine directly below the oil filter. It is a (app.)
one-inch circular 
&gt;recessed plug with a long narrow groove.  Is this an access plug to the oil
chamber, an 
&gt;additional oil plug, or THE oil plug with the center bolt being another
strainer?  Also, 
&gt;how do I stop the leak, how do I tighten it and should I be careful of the
torque.

That's the access to the oil pressure relief valve - when you remove that
screw ( I used the widest screwdriver I could find + 'help' from a 6&quot;
crescent wrench) you'll find a spring, and on top of the spring a simple
piston.  The piston 'should' come out with a magnet: depending on your '87's
miles &amp; oil change intervals, varnish may hang it up.  *BUT* it's not
necessary to remove it - just unscrew the cap, goop it up with pipe thread
sealant (*NOT* tape - use pastey Teflon stuff), &amp; you'll be home free, no
mo' leaks!
