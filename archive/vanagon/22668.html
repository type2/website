I had brought this up once before.  Anyone seen the early '80s Disney
movie &quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot; ???

 &gt; This is a most excellent reason.  Actually, I'd forgotten that Alaska has

 &gt; out that the Alaska tourism folks are worried about the wolves keeping the
 &gt; moose herds in such nice balance.  It seems that they can no longer say that
 &gt; hunting is required to keep the herds in check.  So the solution is to shoot
 &gt; wolves from airplanes.  They're hoping that the moose herd populations will
 &gt; then explode, giving those nice hunters plenty to shoot at.
