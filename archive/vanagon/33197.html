Subject: Re: Blizzard of '96


Not that I expect it to last more than one winter, but I cut some 
aluminum soda cans and clamped them into place. It was a quick fix with 
available parts, but it seems to work for the short term. 8) Joe

&gt; &gt;        Ok, we're chock full of greasy do it yourselfer's here, right?
&gt; &gt;Here's my proposal: I hate that dammned connection between the header and
&gt; &gt;heater box as much as the next guy. If I knew how, I would get rid of it
&gt; &gt;and put in something that'd last longer than 2 weeks. Anybody got any
&gt; &gt;ideas?
