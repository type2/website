Subject: Out spending Money

Well, took some time off from work, to have a mental holiday as I prepare to
start a new job at the end of the month.  Been doing all kinds of
&quot;wonderful&quot; things, like income taxes and &quot;honey do&quot; list items.  Also, been
throwing $$ at the vanagon.

Thanks to:  Jon Reed, Tim Smith, Chris Pittack, Shawn &amp; Janis Wright, Roy
Mathers,  Richard Schmittdiel, and Kenyon Fairey ( and any one else who may
have replied via digest that I have not yet read) for their inputs.  This
morning I got the Uniroyal Larado AWPs from price/costco, considerably
cheaper than the Michelins, Bridgestones, or other sources of Uniroyals.   
My initial reaction is positive,  and the steering effort has gone WAY down.
 The price out the door at Costco was $261.70, for a set of 4 tires,
including balancing, valve stems, tax,  w/free rotations, flat repairs, road
hazard warranty, etc.  Not too bad (&quot;considering&quot;).

Also had the front windshield replaced this afternoon.  The wife was driving
the van several months ago and stopped a rock with the windshield.  It
immediatly &quot;starred&quot; and cracked, and the crack has been growing slowly ever
since.  Didn't try to have the &quot;star&quot; repaired, because it cracked
immediatly.  Went through my insurance company, USAA and they steered me to
a local shop that is a chain with whom they do business.  For the cost of my
$100 deductable, the windshield AND the rubber gasket that mounts it were
replaced.  While it was out, I looked at the metal frame, and was pleased to
see nothing more than a small amount of very fine, dry road dirt in the area
covered by the gasket.  No evidence of rust or bubbling paint.

So, again, thanks to all who provided some input on the tires, it helped
make the decision on more than solely the basis of cost, and provided some
confidence in the choice.
