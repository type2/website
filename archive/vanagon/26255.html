Subject: Re: Steering Damper and RMMW

Nate,

Replacing the steering damper is about like falling off a log.  No need to
explain; it's that easy.

Rocky Mountain Motor Works:  Probably the best selection of parts and the
fastest service in the biz.  A little pricey, though.  In the past few
months, I've probably ordered $1,000 or so from them.  They had almost
everything I wanted in stock.  It helps to have their catalogue and send
them a fax with their part number next to each part on your list.  They can
process it really quickly that way.

I told them that I work on VWs part-time and gave them my resale number
(valid) and they gave me a 15% discount.  They're still a little expensive,
though, even with the discount.  But the service and fast shipping is worth
it.  I live about 330 miles from there (by Colorado Springs) and they have
the parts to me within two or three days, UPS ground.

Good luck/Have fun,

Cheese
