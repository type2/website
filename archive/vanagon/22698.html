Subject: Cape Cod (ProvidenceTown) Camping?
Date: Mon, 14 Aug 1995 16:32:03 -0400 (EDT)


Well, we're getting ready to load up the trusty '81 Westy for a week-long 
vacation in the Cape Cod area (looking to escape the heat and humidity of 
central Ohio). Co-conspriators are: yours truly, spouse, 2 year old daughter.

We'll be camping, mostly in the area; any net-wisdom on day jaunts, places to 
see, things to do (I'm much more familiar with the west cost.....) got the 
Fodors book; thought the group might have some less generic thoughts.

In the event of an unlikely mechanical break down, reputable shops in the 
Boston/Cape area would also be useful. Any suggestions?

Oh yea, this is also an opportunity to impress the spouse with the power of
this newsgroup; feel free to respond private E-mail to preserve bandwith

BTW, anybody other than Larry Stivers and I make it to the central Ohio vintage
volks gathering on Saturday? I think all nine rust-free central Ohio 
breadloaves were there :-) ; alas, I think we had the only aircooled vanagon
westie at the show.

TIA for any help with the trip!
