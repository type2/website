Subject: Re: Help on importing a Canadian EV Double Cab

&gt; On a similar front, didn't  someone in the Northwest import some Vanagon
&gt; crew cabs? New or used? How did the Tri-stars get here?
&gt; 
 
&gt; Don't forget to budget for the 25% duty as well  :-(.

Hi All:
&gt;From what I understand the guy that I bought my Tristar from here in WA
just went to the border with it and paid the 25% duty and off he went.
It was a used when he bought it from a VW dealer.
