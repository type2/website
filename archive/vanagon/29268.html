Subject: Leaking Heat Exchr Core

     
     I just discovered that the core in my rear heat exchanger is leaking.  
     
     Of course, I don't recall whether it is repairable or if replacements are 
     available for a reasonable price (sources if known) or if the whole unit 
     has to be replaced.
     
     Anyone out there with the answer?
     
     Pat S.
