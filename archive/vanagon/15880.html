Subject: Re: mpg, was Retro-f. F.I.

&gt;OK OK, I can't stand it. I promised myself that I would lurk for awhile but
Jeez. Would somebody pleeze get a life! If this list was in action 25-30
years ago the typical VW bus owner wouldn't care what week it was much less
being so anal that you'd worry about .2 mpg! Drive the bus and stop
worrying. You are going to get ulcers wondering about inane things like
this. I have never flamed anyone in my life but some one pushed a button I
guess. Go camping. Go fishing, disconnect the odometer. Go get a bottle of
&quot;Night Train&quot;, ask your kid for a joint and whip out the old Sam Kinison
video and chill. If you're joking then I grabbed it hook line and sinker.
Whew, I needed that. (Anybody have a Spice rack?)

------------------------Old Anal Concerns Below------------------------------

Doesn't engine friction generally decrease (until the tail-end of the engine's 
&gt;life anyway) as time goes on? The mileage on our Jetta has gone up 1-2 mph 
&gt;gradually in the nearly 4 years that we've owned it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;This has been discussed thoroughly last fall. Here's my experience:
&gt;&gt; &gt;1980 Vanagon with Pop top, 2.0l F.I., Man. Trans., no extras
&gt;&gt; &gt; -&gt; 15-17 mpg on short trips
&gt;&gt; &gt; -&gt; up to 22 or 23 mpg on long highway runs (60-65 mph)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; well, see, i'm getting a little worried about my bus. the mpg has been going
&gt;&gt; UP for the last 16,000 miles. to such an extent that the AVERAGE for 86,000
&gt;&gt; miles has risen 0.2 mpg. now, to me, that's a lot (for the long term average)
&gt;&gt; ... and it worries me. for years, it plodded along at 19.4 average. now it's
&gt;&gt; creeped up to 19.6 and gives every indication of going to 19.7 this summer.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; yeah, i know: don't look a gift horse in the mouth. but this bothers me,
&gt;&gt; if it was going down, then i'd know something was wrong and i'd had some
&gt;&gt; ideas. but this! i don't think i'm driving that much slower. i don't think
&gt;&gt; i'm driving any less in town. the ONLY thing i can connect to this is that i
&gt;&gt; started using those Bosch triple-electrode plugs just about the time the mpg
&gt;&gt; started going up a little. ??? coincidence?? maybe the plugs just suit my
&gt;&gt; driving style better? maybe the old plugs were that much wrong??
&gt;&gt; maybe they've done something to the gasoline around here? maybe my bus is
&gt;&gt; really a Democrat?? ;)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhh!!!! old folks hate change!! :)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; anyway, i'm getting up to 21-22 on the highway now. and 17-18 in town.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; subject to change without notice.
