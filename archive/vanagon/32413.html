Subject: RE: forced induction


&gt;        So I'm thinking to myself, I've got this huge blower fan on the
&gt;ceiling of my engine compartment that is controlled by a switch on the
&gt;dash.  Its purpose is to blow air down into the heat exchangers to boost
&gt;the heater output.  I'm thinking I could unhook the hose at the heat
&gt;exchanger and clamp it around the intake on the air cleaner.  One flip
&gt;of the switch and I would have positive manifold pressure, through the
&gt;air cleaner.  Probably not a lot, but perhaps 1 psi?  Half of a psi?


Been there, done that with a '69 bus in Colorado many moons ago. 1600
Dual port, Solex 34 PICT-3. In a nutshell, it didn't work, mostly because
the engine wants to draw in far more air than the fan can provide. Also,
even if the engine weren't trying to suck in tons of air, the fan can't
provide a boost of more than about 1/10 psi on a good day. I don't know
how much additional generator load is created-- probably something
similarly small, I would guess.

OTOH, it can't hurt to try. it probably won't hurt anything, though the
engine winds up pulling the fan more than the fan pushes the engine air.
You're talking about a sort of a supercharger here, of course. But note
that all superchargers (whether exhaust-driven turbos or belt-driven
directs) spin up to incredible speeds, for the purpose of pumping massive
quantities of air while simultaneously compressing it all-- not an easy
task.

The blower fan in your heater system, isn't designed for real high speeds--
once the airflow rate through it reaches a certain speed, the fan won't
be putting ANY pressure on the air, despite the fact that it's still using
amps. Beyond that speed, it will become just another obstruction in the
flow path.
