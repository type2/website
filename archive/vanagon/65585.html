&gt; I took photos of the system this weekend and should have posted on my web
&gt; site later this week. However, after going through the effort of removing
&gt; the muffler and fitting the S&amp;S muffler, guess what?  It doesn't fit. Well,
&gt; it fits but the mounting straps on the muffler point to places with nothing
&gt; to mount to.
&gt;
&gt; Either the muffler does not fit, or the kit I got from the Bus boys was
&gt; missing hardware, or the Bus boys shipped me the wrong system. At the
&gt; moment my suspicions are that I got the wrong system as the header has
&gt; studs mounted near the rear-facing exhaust flanges (where the header mounts
&gt; to the head.) for something to bolt to. I don't see anything that would
&gt; mount to these studs - unless it is part of the muffler support I'm missing.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I emailed S&amp;S tech support and CC'd the bus boys, I'll post what
&gt; the result is.
&gt; BTW - the bus boys email was returned by their server saying that they had
&gt; &quot;exceeded their quota.&quot;  Guess they are not reading their mail.
&gt;
&gt; I did make a temporary bracket to hold the muffler - because that was
&gt; easier than reinstalling the original muffler for the moment. Seems to add
&gt; a little pep, but it might just be that the replacement muffler is easily
&gt; half the weight of the original.

Hey Todd:

My S&amp;S Turbo muffler fits perfectly.  It tucks up under the rear cowling
and bolts right into the current braket.
