&gt; Help!
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody own a 95 Eurovan Camper?  Opinions?

Tom--

	Yes, we now own one.  Traded in our 93 EV GL.  Only have a bit over
1K on the odometer and just took it out for the first weekend camping.  My
wife and I love it.  No problems to report really except for a couple little
workmanship things.  All the camping stuff works great, especially the
furnace.  Lots of room.  Gas mileage is over 20.  Drives like a dream.  
Recommend the awning and screen add-ons; they are *real* nice.
