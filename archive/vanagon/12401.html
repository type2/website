So Jon Peters/UB Networks says:
&gt; &gt;speakers. Also, the front speakers need to be flush mounted because of
&gt; &gt;the window crank being so close, so that limits your options.
&gt; 
&gt; I know nothing about speakers, but I am contemplating adding a
&gt; non-directional sub to improve the bass response. Do you think something
&gt; like that would solve *your* problem?
&gt;

This is interesting.  A similar discussion is going on at the vintage list
only it started up with outfitting a Type III Squareback.  The road/engine
VW noise factor has spurred a question of whether or not to use tapes or 
CD's.  Some of you may want to subscribe just to have a peek at what they're
saying.  Low-end in a Type II definitely is a problem with all of the
road noise.  I play tapes cause I'm used to doing the recordings from LP's
and now, CD's.  I understand why people wouldn't do this though because
it would be too much hassle.  I'm just used to it.

I know, blah-blah-blah,

Steven
