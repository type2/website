Subject: Re:creampuff/drool cup/suicide?

&gt;1967 VW Campmobile, White, one owner, 51,455 miles mint condition. Phone
605-348-7353 or days 605 348-1177
&gt;
&gt;I called the guy tonight, and get this story (are you sitting down with
your drool cups in hand?) The original owner was this guys uncle who
recently died at 80 something. The old guy and his wife bought it to go
camping in, as they had no kids and lots of free time. Included in the story
was the fact that the old guy only drove it on clear summer days, and would
open the engine compartment and wipe off the engine with his handkerchief
when he was done driving it.

If I didn't have this much already into the Resto from Hell( and it's not
even out of the body shop) and didn't' value my marriage or job I'd fly
there today. Let's part it out! I want the spice rack!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHGGGGGGGG! $5000.00 is a fair price if you are
thinking of doing any resto and want a '67. You and I both know it'll go for
$4500-4800. Dang! Jeeves,rev up the Lear jet...
