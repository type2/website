&gt;&gt;I don't know the proper nomenclature, I guess.  This thing was a Westfalia
&gt;&gt;pop-top, a full-width bench seat/bed in the back, Wofsburg logos, a
&gt;&gt;little removable refrigerator behind the passenger seat, and a funky
&gt;&gt;rear-facing seat behind the driver, with a storage compartment under it.
&gt;&gt;A table folds against the wall on the driver's side.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So what is it?  Many others have this arrangement, with some reporting only
&gt;&gt;the studs left on the floor where the reefer went.

&gt;It sounds like either a &quot;base&quot; camper from 86 or 87, not a GL Camper.  I'd
&gt;bet it is either:
&gt;A. 1986 Camper Wolfsburg Edition, not a 1987.  
&gt;B. 1987 Camper that someone applied Wolfsburg Edition badges to.
&gt;

I have this model and it is an 86 Wolfsburg.  I like it at least a well as
previous Westy that I owned.  I never found much use for cooking on the
inside propane stove.  I carry a neat little one burner gas stove and a
couple of jugs of water.  Rigged me a little table out the side door for
cooking etc.  There seems to be much more room inside for BSing or playing
cards around the table.
