Subject: Flakey fan switch in '85 Vanagon


Things are going pretty well with my van since I rebuilt the transaxle but 
I found something pretty minor to complain about. It looks like I'm working 
on replacing my second fan switch. I was able to rebuild/clean the original 
one a couple times before I bought a relacement a couple years ago. Well my 
replacement went out on me last night! What's the story on these things. 
What's interesting though is that I've never had a problem with the aux fan 
switch. 

Like I said, this is pretty minor but I thought I would just check in and 
see how many other folks have had problems with fan switches.

Steve
