Subject: Re: Fw: Ques: squeak under passenger seat.

&gt; &gt; There is a pronounced squeak emanating from under the front passenger
&gt; seat
&gt; &gt; |on 89 Westy. Squeaks regardless of whether or not a passenger is seated.
&gt; &gt; Any suggestions?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks.

It's been covered on the list a while back as a suspension bushing. My
'88 has done it since we got it 15k ago, but it's safe to ignore for a
while (apparently), so I have. I think it is one of the inner A-arm
pivot bushings, but I haven't priced them out. Possibly spraying
silicone in/on them would help for a while?
