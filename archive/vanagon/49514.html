Subject: Advice Sought: Vanagon FI Diagnostics

Hi All,

I recently purchased a 1982 Vanagon (yes another!) that has some Fuel
Injection problems.  I'm gong to put my new multi-tester to use and go
through the Bentley Manual to trace down the problem.  It seems more like
working on a computer than a VW!  I swapped out the injectors, but it's
still flurperling on me. 

Before I begin my adventure, does anyone have any insights or helpful
advice to help me along my way?  I have an extra complete FI setup out of
an 82 Westy for spare parts.  8-)  TIA,
