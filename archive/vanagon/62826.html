Subject: Inter-coolers?

Good morning All,
I just received  a note from Helmut suggesting an inter-cooler for my 1.9L
TD re-power.Now i don't want to sound stupid (er) but, to be honest, I've
never seen one. Does this pre-cool intake air to make it more dense? Are
they available? Any info is appreciated,
 Bob Bellanca
