Well, the engine is in.  That much is done.  It took the better part 
of an afternoon and two helpers but it is in there.  Alas, the battery
is dead.  Today I am getting a battery or at least a jump.  Meanwhile,
I have a question about the throttle cable.  

I have installed a Weber progressive on my otherwise pretty stock 
1600DP.  I have heard from others that this combination requires 
moving the throttle tube up in the fan housing to get a better angle 
on the cable.  I can see that.  I think I bent mine putting it in and 
it won't return easily right now.  I have a new spare and I am going 
to give that a try this evening.  I am wondering about a couple of 
things first.  How hard is it to drill this hole to move the tube?  
Where exactly, 1&quot;, 2&quot;?  If I have to pull the motor, forget it.  Which 
brings me to my second question.  Why not just install one of those 
bicycle type throttle cables I have heard about?  The angle it needs 
to make is not that bad compared to some I have seen on bikes.  Also, 
the average pressure on a bike brake cable has to be several times 
more than that on a throttle cable.  I have seen both ends at hardware
stores, I might just make my own.  That is, if replacing the bent 
stock cable doesn't work.  Any other ideas on this?  Someone 
know of a source for the above mentioned cable?  Is it super easy to 
just drill a hole and move the tube?  It doesn't seem to be.  What 
about getting all the metal shavings in the fan housing?  Seems scary.

Sign me, nearly on the road, Jim
