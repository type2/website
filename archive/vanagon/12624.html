&gt;much less two in the same issue).  I write the ads exactly as they 
&gt;appeared in the Auto-Trader.  The first one says &quot;Rare 1960&quot;.  I write 
&gt;&quot;Rare 1960&quot;.  He responds &quot;What makes it so rare?&quot;  How the hell do I 

Calm down.  You were not being flamed!  We are merely commenting on
the claim of the advertiser that he has some rare item, which really isn't
so rare.   Its kinda like talking back to the TV (television, not transvestite-
dad would slap me for talking back)
