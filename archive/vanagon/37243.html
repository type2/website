Subject: '84 Westy Thanks

I just wanted to thank the list members publically who quickly responded 
to my recent post about the airseal around a converted to air '84. A lot 
of helpful advice, and not a one cared to comment *too* much on my not 
knowing better. You guys were really nice to a newbie. 

This may be off topic, but I just want you all to know that I am very 
pleased I found the Vanagon list. Happy VWing to you all!

Ron &quot;determined to be a happy '84 Westy camper&quot; Fish
