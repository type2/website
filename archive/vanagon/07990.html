Yup....smug air-cooleds.  I started my van this morning -- about the same
temps as Mike and it started right up.  Before I got 2 miles, it was warm
enough to take the gloves off.  I'm so glad I don't have to live with
air-cooled here in the frozen north. Even with perfectly working heat and
a brand new '68 bus, when we were kids, we were COLD.  Now, my kids are
perfectly comfortable. 

I'll taking melt-down head gaskets any time &lt;grin&gt;.

So, speaking of cold, Doug. Did your bus warm up today?
