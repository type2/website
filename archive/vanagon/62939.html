The &quot;5 year&quot; Prestone is phosphate free. The regular stuff in the yellow 
jugs is not. The new fluid is bright orange, shows up great when you have
the smallest leak. It leaves a bright orange stain behind.

&gt;Hi!
&gt;
&gt;Someone a couple of days ago asked what brands of coolant are cool for
&gt;Vanagons (&quot;phosphate-free&quot;).  If anyone answered, I missed it.
&gt;
&gt;Yesterday I went to K-Mart and looked at Prestone (that's all they
&gt;had!).  I remember reading a month or two ago that someone was going
&gt;strong with Prestone.  Prestone was kind enough to list their
&gt;ingredients:  ethelyne glycol, water, and &quot;proprietary&quot; additives. 
&gt;Period.  No &quot;phosphate-free&quot; marker on the jug. . . .  No hint at the
&gt;formulation of their &quot;proprietary&quot; stuff.
&gt;
&gt;I have been running on h2o alone for a month or two, since I burst a
&gt;hose during a creeping commute to the nation's capital.  Replacing the
&gt;coolant will be my first serious task on my new '87 GL.  I have the
&gt;Bentley manual. . . .  
&gt;
&gt;Advice?  Ideas?  Thanks!!!
