&gt; &gt; 
&gt; In the 10,000 miles we have put on the Westfalia, I have used 2 Frams, the
&gt; Canadian Tire equivalent manufactured by Fram and a Bosch and can
&gt; honestly say that there has been no noticeable difference in oil pressure
&gt; either at speed or at idle between them . OTOH, switching from 30 W single
&gt; grade
&gt; to 40 W single grade and then to 20w50 did increase in each case the oil
&gt; pressure. Now I am using 10w30 synthetic with a slight drop in pressure.
&gt; What makes this interesting from my perspective is that adding a remote
&gt; filter and second cooler actually BOOSTED pressure by 10psi not the
&gt; reverse which is the conventional wisdom. So in a never ending search for ever
&gt; better oil pressure, the next time around the choice will be an original VW
&gt; filter. DC

	I've been watching this thread with some bemusement... especially 
	the worrying about oil pressure instead of moving part lubrication.
	IF you are using a high-quality synthetic (Mobil1, SYNTEC, etc)
	fluctuations in oil pressure should not be cause for alarm. HIGH
	oil pressure should NOT be a HolyGrail...Even *better* oil pressure
	shouldn't be cause for rejoicing unless your engine *needs* it!

	It's also interesting to think about the VW OEM filter bypass valve
	and why said valve isn't built into the engine like in some other
	vehicles. Having an oil FILTER, at all, in a horizontally oppposed
	VW was, after all, a significant forward step!

	My Villager mini-van has a ball-valve on the engine side of the 
	oil-filter receiver, for example, allowing me to use those cheap 
	FRAM/Purolator/TARGET/etc filters with its Quarterly (~8-10Kmiles) 
	Mobil1 change.

	I'll bet most of you DIY oilchangers cause more engine damage after 
	an oil change by NOT filling the filter (OEM or not) BEFORE 
	installation than you might incur with perceived low oil pressure(s).
