&gt; Two trips, same route, so. Iowa to no. Michigan &amp; environs.

&gt; only one from the dozen or so Vanagons we passed, much less *any* from those
&gt; snotty Eurovan drivers... ;)  Also got honks and waves from folks in

Its these darned allergies.  All the decongestants and antihistamines and 
I'm still snotty......

&gt; ordinary &lt;yawn&gt; cars, who no doubt were saying to their kids, &quot;Honey, look
&gt; at the old hippie van!  Hardly ever see *them* anymore!&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Second trip, in Der Blaue Reiter, just about everybody waved, *even* a
&gt; Eurovan. But alas, no ordinary cars.  Vanagons don't attract non-VW
&gt; attention.  Is Blue than much more respectable than Die Frau?
