Subject: Re CV joints bolts Clunk x 2

oops, it was late and i was psycho.  the bolts connect to the right 
side and on the wheel end.  Last night (6/23) all six bolts were loose; 
loose to the point that I could _PULL_ out five of them, but i didn't. 
the sixth bolt needed just over one turn to remove.  Previous, the six 
had come out of the wheel plate but stayed on the CV.  The dealership 
installed bolt last year, an import repair with a good reputation fixed 
last time, and I will try to do it this time (I'm good with software 
but not hardware).

To Mr Joel Walker and Mr David Schwarze: Thanks for some good ideas:)  
I just tho't it strange when it happens to only one of four possible. 

Been enjoying the other discussions out here.

Steven Broomhead, Sr.  NO, NOT Bloomfield or Brownfield, just plain 
Broomfield... NO, Bloomhead, NO, _wait_ Broomhead! yah, Broomhead!
