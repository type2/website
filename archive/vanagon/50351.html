&gt;certain little &quot;secret pin&quot; or something you have to remove first to be able to
&gt;unscrew them. Unfortuneately he declined to elaborate on what that little
&gt;&quot;secret pin&quot; was.                 ( methinks to spite me?!? )   Anyway, at


OK,  name names, if this info was witheld as a joke, fine, lets ALL hear it
