Subject: Hoo Boy! (Was: Corrado Powered Westy Syncro - For

May I also interject that this guy has really done it up as
my G60 Corrado has only 158hp stock, this thing must have
all the typical bells and whistels ie increased boost, chipped,
exhasut etc.  Awesome but should be a lot cheaper, heck a
G60 motor with all injection components goes for $2500 with
blower if you scrounge.  And would bolt right into a diesel,
now into a Syncro I don't know, them guys were working this
on the conversion crazies weren't they for a standard Wabbit
mill?  Anybody ever figure it out? I thought it was a no go based
on engine length and the fact diesels had the tranny shoved
forward or somesuch.
