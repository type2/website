Terry,

Regarding clogged brake lines, you may wish to consider installing stainless
steel lines and using silicone-based fluid.  The alcohol contained in regular
(DOT3) brake fluid absorbs moisture, hence the need to replace it every few
years.  Failure to do so eventually produces rusty brake lines.  The silcone
stuff contains no alcohol; it has no periodic replacement requirement.  And
of course, the stainless steel lines don't rust.

	1: DOT 3 and DOT 4 do absorb water. DOT 5 doesn't absorb it- it
beads up in specific spots in your system and rusts them alone. No
brake fluid should be left permenently in your system- try flushing
at one year intervals and if you like the color of what comes out,
then try 2 years. You'll be amazed at how cruddy 2 year old fluid, 
of ANY type, looks.

	2: DOT 3 and DOT 4 are intermixable. DOT 5 CANNOT be mixed
with 3 or 4- you have to empty and dry out your lines before using
DOT 5

	3: &quot;Stainless Steel&quot; brake lines are braided stainless steel 
wire over some kind of flexible hose- often teflon. Rust in brake lines
affect the hard steel pipes tied to the chassis, not the flexible pipes.
