&gt; I'm over at Pacific Bugs and there's a bunch of kids wetting
&gt; themselves around this bitchin' sano lowered '68 bus, the one
&gt; with no hatch on the engine compartment so everyone can admire
&gt; the chrome.  Chrome everything.  The kid has even chromed the
&gt; wires.

Bitchin', sano, lowered *and* '68 bus in a single descriptive phrase?  Not
possible.  And why be so verbose, when &quot;butchered&quot; would suffice (hope I
don't get burned for this one).  But then, I'm one of those vintage
perverts [&quot;can I call 'em 'Preverts?'&quot;] talked about on another thread (I
do make an exception for Thom's choice of colors for his bus, though.  I
LIKE the two-tone green idea).

Rest of story was religious, though.  I hope to live long enough to have a
chance to make a pronouncement from On High just once!
