Subject: Side tents.


A friend of mine is looking for the kind of tent that likes to attach to 
the sliding door of an 86 westy...  Does anyone have one that they would 
be willing to part with?  I don't know how much she's willing to pay, 
but it would depend on the condition of the tent, i'm sure.  

I haven't checked out Dworkin's page yet, I figgerred I'd ask here first 
and only have slynx web access at this terminal.

Any info, or tents you can point me towards would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.


Cheers,
