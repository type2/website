Subject: Cheap struts for Vgon rear hatch


I mentioned that JCW had these struts for $19.99 each plus a lot of
shipping and a long wait. Promised that I'd try them on the V6anagon
if it needed them.

I lied. Just picked up two from World Parts Depot, 4990 Naples St.
in San Diego (619) 275-4240, for $15.00 each. Made in Germany, even.
This is the same place I got the '80 Vanagon clutch for $111, all Sachs,
100% German parts, disc, plate, t/o bearing, pilot bearing.

The bad news: They usually don't ship out of town, they said.

The good news: I might, if you promise not to make fun of the V6anagon.
How many people out there would like to replace your rear hatch struts
for less than an arm and a leg?

Left and right are identical. But there is one part number for Vanagons
without rear wiper (like mine), which they had in stock. A different part
number for Vanagons with rear wiper, which they said they were out of
stock on that day.

Step right up, hurry, hurry. Tell me:

     year
     address
     with or without rear wiper

I'll get price, UPS shipping cost, and availability if they run out,
and Email you back the info. Then send money.
