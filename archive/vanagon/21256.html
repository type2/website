Subject: Other problems for today:  Lots of smoke
Date: Thu, 20 Jul 1995 15:15:51 -0600 (MDT)

Hello again vanagon gang,
Well, there is yet another problem for today that I need some advice
for from the vanagon diesel people ....
My vanagon has (rather suddenly) started sending lots of black smoke
out the exhaust.  Sometime between last night and this afternoon, this has
happened.   The only real hints that I have are this:
one of the fuel injectors is leaking a bit, it seems and my accelerator
cable broke.  After I put a temporary fix on this, I noticed the smoke.
Any ideas?
&gt;From what I know:
black smoke relates to unburned fuel.  It can also be related to a fuel
pump slightly out of time.  It can also be related to the mixture screw
on the back of the fuel pump.  But, what is not clear is why would this
happen suddenly?
Stuart
