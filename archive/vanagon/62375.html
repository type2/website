&gt;Thanks for putting this together.  I might be interested, however I'd like
&gt;to know more about the tent and how much it costs.  Can we see it at a web
&gt;site or can you sent brochures?  My Westy is an '85.  I'd heard that the
&gt;tent that was available in Germany for the Vanagon doesn't have a floor.
&gt;Is this the same tent, and if so wouldn't this be a problem in the rain?
