Subject: Re: heating water for westy camping trips

I owned an 86 Weekender and that was our solution as we drove across the
US for 3 months.  The water only got really hot when it was relatively
warm out and the sun was beaming.  By dinner time, it would only be
lukewarm.  But it sat in the luggage rack just fine.  We just tied the
four corners down and used bungy cords in an X pattern just to be sure. 
If nothing else it was a handy place to store dish water and gravity
makes no pump necessary.

&gt; Has anyone had experience using the H2O shower or other type of &quot;bags&quot; that
&gt; are supposed to heat water for showers while camping?  We were thinking of
&gt; using it by putting it the luggage area in front of the pop top and letting
&gt; the hose hang through the drivers window into the sink-when needed.  I'm
&gt; sure it would warm enough for washing hands but what about dishes?
