Subject: RE: Oil Oil Oil Light....


&gt;Ok...So...I stopped at the construction site of my new house, and
&gt;looked at the work-in-progress....and when I came back, I started
&gt;NuBus..I noticed two things:
&gt;
&gt;   1) The oil light was on.
&gt;
&gt;   2) The brakes sucked.


Maybe you suddenly developed a hole in your power-brake booster
vacuum hose (assuming you have power front discs-- do diesels have
these?), which both lessened the effectiveness of the power boost, and
also made your engine idle so slowly that the oil pump couldn't develop
enough pressure? Something sort of like this happened to me in my
'71 Bus.

But, if the oil light stayed on as you drove at higher engine speeds, then
*never mind*

My $.02... hope it helps.
