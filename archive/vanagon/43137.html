Subject:       Help me ID Euro-Camper

I'm in the process of trying to track down the title of a breadloaf 
camper conversion that was apparently made in italy and germany.  
I have the option to buy, but the owner lives in Canada, and I 
wont purchase it unless I can junk the mostly fiberglass and bondo 
body (evidently held together by a good ganja tar binder, as 
evidenced by the smell inside).  In the meantime, I'm curious to 
find out what I have.

The body style is what I recognize as a'72-79 US model (cassis # 224 
xxxx xxx), but the engine is 
obviously a single port upright with a motorola alternator and a 009 
(aftermarket) distributor, not to mention so much emissions 
gadgetry that at first I thought I was looking at a Chevy Citation 
(no offense, Steve. Thats really what it reminds me of). The cooling 
tin used is slick- - it totaly seals the T4 engine 
compartment around the T1 engine, and seems to bolt to stock T1 tin. 
The tranny looks like the beefier models on '72+ US busses.  The pop-
top is UGLY.  It starts about two feet in back of the windscreen, and 
was made in Italy, acording to the name plate. There's a picture of a 
nekkid woman sealed in to the interior of the pop top with resin.  It 
was either done at the factory, or by someone very good in 
fiberglass, and very lacking in taste.  The outside has been 
painted with dark blue latex.  The canvas is all good. 

The camper setup is nice.  All birch plywood, green &amp; yellow plaid 
upholstery, stove and fridge, swing out table, and all the 
instructions are in German.  I'm assuming it's Westfalia, but 
having never seen a Westy interior from the late '70s, how can I 
tell?  It is in excellent condition.  

The running gear is in ok shape, but according to the guy whose lot 
it's sitting on, the engine won't start.  (He hasn't tried)   

I'm going for it, but like I said, I'd like to find the 
title so I can pitch what I dont want when I'm done with it.   

My questions are:

Any idea what I have?

Any ideas as to what year it might be?

Anybody want to buy a pop top with good canvas &amp; a nekkid lady (-;?

Any interest in parts? (the interior, motor &amp; CV's are spoken for)

Any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!

-Shaun
