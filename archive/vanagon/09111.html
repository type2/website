Subject: Re: Antenna Mounting

If I was mounting a cellular phone antenna (the type with the spiral in 
the center section) and not afraid of drilling, I would have no choice 
but to buy a second and mount the pair at the front upper corners. 

It has been 20 years since I was in the high school radio club but I
believe this may also be close to the best technical location.  For UHF,
high and centered is the best location, as all transmission is line of
sight. But appearance would more than make up for the front to back
offset, and the extra 2 feet of height you would have over other cars
would give you a better range anyway. If you use the folding antenna, the 
risk from low garages isn't even a problem.  If you want to experiment, 
you might buy (with an exchange understanding) one of the magnetic mount 
antennae, try it in various locations and then exchange the magnetic for a 
fixed mount and drill away.
