Subject: Starter rebuild

My starter is getting tired and either needs to be replaced or rebuilt.
It has been rebuilt once before and I am wondering:

	1) What is involved in rebuilding the starter?
	2) How many times can I rebuild it before it is not worth the
	effort anymore? (Or is it ever worth the effort?)

Mark
