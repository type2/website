&gt; U.S.!  Any suggestions?  How reliable are junkyard brains, and how much 
&gt; should I expect to pay for a used one?  What kind of warrenty should I 
&gt; expect?  Are there any aftermarket sources that are cheaper and/or 
&gt; better?  I would appreciate any advice.  Thanks for listening.

Since electric parts are typically nonreturnable I caution you to
inspect the brain carefully before buying, make sure no corrosion
on connectors, then open it up and check for no corrosion or water
damage inside, that said, the brain in my '76 was replaced under
warranty in '77 and was still fine when I sold it a few months ago
so go for it, I figure $150 or so from someone who knows what its worth
much less from a yard that doesnt, you might consider the Parts Place in
Michigan, I think they want $150 or so and will probably gaurantee it
good for return for a like part only if its not, after all they can't
help you swap out parts till you find the problem. FAQ has list of
interchangeable parts I believe.
