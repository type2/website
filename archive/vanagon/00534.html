&gt;The fuel lines in my 76 camper (the braided cloth over rubber lines) are
&gt;looking kind of shabby, and I think there's a leak by the distributor.  (the
&gt;cold-start-valve???)  Anyway, I was thinking about replacing them, especially
&gt;considering the stories I've heard about them catching on fire.

Most Definitely Replace ALL the fuel lines, not just the ones over the
engine ... but the ones from and back to the fuel tank. ALL of them!
and while you are at it, get a Fire Extinguisher!! :)

&gt;Do I have to get special lines or clamps?  (The bentley book said 35 psi...)
&gt;Does anyone know the amount and diameters of line needed?
&gt;Is there some special kit?  (unlikely...)
&gt;Has anyone done this before???

special lines: well, yes. make SURE it is reinforced Fuel Injection Rated
hose ... if not, it will 'bubble' up. this happened to me, cause i didn't
check the hose before i put it in (i was in a hurry). luckily, i saw the
bubble before it burst!  special clamps? no, just make sure they are the
right size. the kind that have a slotted hex headed screw (so you can use
either a flat screwdriver OR a small socket) are best. if you really want
to spend some money, get the special kind that are used on porsches. :)

how much hose to get? my 80 bus and my 88 bus both took about 15 feet. more
is better (in case you make mistakes). i cut the new hose by measuring against
the old one, doing one at a time, working my way from the tank into the
engine and around the ring and back to the tank. if you have a carb, you
probably won't need the return line.  i cut my new lines a tad longer than
the old one just because it is easier to trim off some ... and impossible to
add any. :) also be sure to notice WHERE each line is routed ... i.e., did it
go Over the intake manifold ... or under it?  behind the distributor or in
front.

takes a couple of hours ... mostly looking, and thinking, and looking, and
fiddling around. keep a towel handy to soak up the gas that will leak when
you remove the old hose. and BE SURE to take the towel(s) out of the engine
area BEFORE you try to crank the car (to test the fuel lines for leaks).
(i didn't and the towel got wrapped around the pulley and threw off the fan
belt!).  and when you are finished, wait a while before you crank for the
test ... to let the fumes of any spilled gas dissipate. mop up as much of
the gas as you can. and be sure to check for leaks when you crank it.

i did NOT replace the little short pieces of hose that are connected to the
injectors (it's only about two inches long) cause i didn't want to remove
the injectors. i probably ought to, but keep putting it off. :(

that's all i can think of right now. if you 76 is like mine, you'll need
mostly one size line ... except for the one piece from the fuel tank to the
fuel pump: that one was larger than all the rest.

good luck.
