&gt;Ref the 4 ventilation levers in the dash of my '87 Vanagon - how the bloody
&gt;heck does one remove them (as in I need to replace the fan switch; yeah, you
&gt;can fake it by bending the facia, remove the radio, etc)?  In other VeeWee's
&gt;in the past these levers would just pull straight out, but not these!

aha! grasshopper have dim eyes! ;) there's a trick: you have to take a small
flat thin object and look on the BOTTOM side of the lever ends ... there's
a little click-tab under there. push the tab up with the SFTO (small thin
flat object) and the end of the lever pulls right off. note, if you will,
the relative positioning of the lever end!! it only goes back on correctly
one way ... otherwise, it'll bump the next lever down. that is, they go
back on in pairs, one facing up, the next one down facing down. that sort
of thing.

hope it helps.
