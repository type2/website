Subject: Security Code on Radio

I've gotten this advice &amp; this result:
-waited one hour -no luck;
-put in 1111 - no luck;
-disconect from battery - no luck; 
-give dealer &gt;$C120 -no frig'en way;
-put it in home deep freezer - no luck;
-put it in -10xC freezer -no luck; 
soooo
....... I've made arrangements for the the
radio to spend some time in an
&quot;ultra-freezer&quot; at -70 xC.

Any thoughts on the possibility of -70 xC
totally destroying a radio/tape player?

If the objective is to &quot;freeze&quot; the memory
out of some clip, would 24 hors do it?
Longer?
