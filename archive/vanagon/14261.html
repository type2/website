&gt;&gt;(David, wannna attempt to draw an ascii schema of what you've been
&gt;&gt;talking about?)
&gt;&gt;

OK, here is what I have in mind:



   +12V --+----------------------------+--------------+-------+
          |                            |              |       |

          O 470 1/4watt           470  O              | C     X D
          O                            O          ____+___   +X
          |    R                  R    |   100  B|    n   | E |
          +---OOO---+         +--OOO---+---OOO-+-|p      n|---+----- 6V out

        ______      |         |      _______   |       tr3    |   
       |  n   |B    |         |    B|   n   |  |              |
       |     p|--+  +------------+--|p      |  +---+           |
       |  n   |  |            |  |  |   n   |      |          | +
       |______|  |____________|  |  |_______|      |         ___        to 6V 
         E|  tr1 |               |     E|   tr2    O         ___ 50 uf  wiper
          |      | +             | +    |          O 200      |         motor

          |     ___  C          ___ C   |          |          |
          |      |               |      |          |          |
          |      |               |      |          |          |
  12V gnd -------+----------------+-----+----------+----------+------ 6V gnd
    
     
   tr1,2 : 2N4401 general purpose small signal transistor ($.20 each)  
   tr3   : Power darlinton transistor (10amp 50v)
   R: 4700 ohm 1/4 watt
   C: 5uf
   D: 2A rectifier diode  (note direction of polarity)        

   R, C values are set for oscilating at less than 60hz. Larger R or C
   results in lower frequency. 

    
   Tr1 and tr2 forms a squarewave vibrator which then drives a darlinton
   power transistor. The power transistor turns on and off the power at
   a 50% duty cycle to drive the motor. Diode D, as Michael Radtke pointed
   out protects tr3 from reverse breakdown caused by the motor when the 
   transistor switchs to off period. The bias resisters for tr3 probably
   needs some tweaking. This shows the basic scheme of the circuit. The
   whole thing could be as cheap as $10.
