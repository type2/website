Without getting too involved, here's a list of things you may want to bring 
along...  

Hiking, fishing, biking, surfing, or boating gear + games, etc.
Autoclub, health insurance, and credit cards plus emergency $$
Proof of insurance, ownership, and registration
Emergency parts and tools
First Aid kit
Tarp
Rain Gear
Camera
Fire Extinguisher
Bedding
Extra water, gas, propane, utensils
Marshmallows and 'smores stuff
Food and drink
Clothes and personal items
Sunglasses and sunblock?
Lanterns, matches, lights, etc.
If anyone is bringing pets, you may be required to show proof of vaccinations
Guitars and harmonicas

Special notes:  Since we'll be inhabiting adjacent private sites, the 
campground suggested we bring folding chairs, so that we can all be together 
around one campfire at night if we want.  If everyone throws in firewood it 
would be helpful

Does anyone have one of those popcorn makers you use over a campfire?

What about meals...separate or together?  Want to try something like a group 
fish chowder for dinner?  Let me know, will be happy to help plan the food.
