Subject: Re: What does heater lever do?

The &quot;B&quot; lever is to control the flow of coolant to the heat exchanger. The
heat valve is under the glove box next to the large black lower center of
the dash. I've found that th cables like to get bent and no longer work the
valve. The cable can bend at both ends so you have to check it out. I've
had limited success straightening the heat valve cable. Be sure to check
the valve when it is hot. The biggest problem I found with the valve cable
is the valve binds when it warms up, bending the new cable. HTH

&gt;says 'Lever B - heat output'.
&gt;
&gt;I have tried it at both extremes and it does not seem to make a difference.
&gt;There is always full heat (which comes out when I let the air flow with
&gt;Lever C).
&gt;
&gt;For example, is the lever meant to control a valve restricting coolant flow
&gt;to the front heat exchanger?
