Subject:       Re: brake system vacuum leak

&gt; &gt; I'm not sure if this is a safety issue or not as the pedal feels fine
&gt; &gt; as long as the engine is running.  Do you think this can wait until a 
&gt; &gt; more convenient time?
&gt; 
&gt; NO.  Find the cause NOW.  You have a plus on your side-- you can hear 
&gt; the leak.   Have a helper trace down the leak with your hearing, you 

Hi Dan.  Yes, you are probably correct.  It might be minor now, but 
could get much worse later on. 

I'll arrange to get the car in asap.  Lecture APPRECIATED!

Thanks again,

Harry.
