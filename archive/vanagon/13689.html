Subject:       VW rotor govenor

Import Service, Dec '90, Vol 3, No 12

&quot;A faulty distributor rotor may cause the engine to cut out on some 
69 to 71 VW Type 1, 2, and 4 vehicles.  the rotor has a built in 
centrifugal govenor cutout that prevents the engine from 
over-revving.  Low speed cuto out may be caused by a weak govenor 
spring.  the rotor can be replaced with a conventional non-governor 
rotor, but the engine may be damaged by over-revving.&quot;
