 So do I look for a 2.0L in  junk yard and have it rebuilt, do I look for a 
 new one (Is there such a thing)? 
 
 What am I looking at as far as money goes and What can I sell the 1600 
 for? I have the paper work from when it was put in Mexico. I'll post some 
 info on that later, because I have questions about it.

My guess is that you will also need th FI stuff as it is probably missing.
 As such, i would look for a wrecked van or a motor with all the FI stuff on
it.  At that point, you can determine it's condition and either use it,
rebuild it, or exhange for a rebuilt engine as you will probably need a core
to buy one.
