The Gerbil has been successfully self-propelled for about a week now.
This is a good thing.  Comparing the before and after pictures is a
little disappointing, though.

First, for the idiot thread:

- Adjust clutch with engine out, because it's so much easier to get
  the adjuster.  This neglects to take into account the fact that the
  travel of the throw-out bearing is affected by the location of the
  pressure plate.  The result was that the engine refused to go in the
  last eighth of an inch, and was acting like it was hanging up on
  something on its midline.  It was, of course, hanging up on the
  throwout bearing.  I, being really frustrated, just tightened the
  mounts down, and everything went together ok.  Then I tried to move
  the clutch pedal....  I had to loosen up the engine studs and crank
  really hard on the clutch adjuster to loosen it up.  Once it was as
  loose as it could get and still be attached, I tightened up the
  engine again (much easier this time), adjusted the clutch, and
  everything was cool.  Total time lost to this problem: two weeks.

I started this 45-minute project of replacing the heater boxes because
there were exhaust fumes coming with the heated air.  The volume of
air, however, was quite adequate.  Now, afterwards, after allowing for
whatever was coating the inside of the heater boxes to burn off, I'm
getting exhaust-like fumes, and not enough air flow to really feel.
The volume is probably due to the flow restrictors that the new
muffler had, which I'm going to look into replacing with normal fresh
air connectors RSN.

At this point, though, I'm really not sure where the exhaust fumes are
coming from.  There are three possibilities that I know of (anyone
know of any others?):

- exhaust being sucked in to the air intakes on the sides of the bus
  (this is more likely on the Gerbil than you'd think, see below)
- oil, etc slowly roasting on top of the engine
- lack of complete sealing in the under-engine-compartment fresh air
  components

The air seals of the engine compartment itself look to be doing a
decent job, so I believe that it is not exhaust being recirculated
that way.  As to roasting oil, I tried to clean the top of the engine
while it was out, but it wasn't a perfect job.  Still, it's a lot
better than it was before this fiasco started.

One of the many problems with the new exhaust system is that the
damper pipe that comes off of the muffler sits entirely within the
curve of the bumper.  This is a problem for probably many reasons.
The first and most obvious is that the bumper gets really hot (i.e.,
the paint in that area is completely blackened).  The bumper curves
around the sides of the bus, about 2/3 of the way to the wheel wells.
Is it reasonable to believe that this is guiding the exhaust around to
where it can come up and get sucked into the air intake on that side?

Does anyone have suggestions on how to get the exhaust out of the
bumper?  I've considered cutting a hole for the tailpipe section
(which isn't on at all right now, due to the bumper), but that seems
like it would cause structural problems with the bumper.  At this
point, the suspicion that I don't have the right muffler is getting
pretty strong.  What should it look like?

Incoherently yours,
