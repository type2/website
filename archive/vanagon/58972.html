Subject: Finally changing coolant on '88 - any tips?

Well, after finally finading some Prestone Long Life coolant, I am 
preparing to change it today.

I plan on using a combination of Bentley &amp; past reports on the list 
for the procedure. Since I have a steep driveway, the slope is a no-
brainer.

A few questions: If I run into problems removing the drain plugs on 
the heads &amp; decide to chicken out rather than strip/break bolts, is 
it ok to drain from next lowest point, flush with water, drain, then 
refill? (I want to be prepared for this, since the heat shield bolts 
look pretty rusted at the exhaust ports.)

Also, what is the best way to fill the system while the engine is 
running and the van is sloped - can the &quot;refill&quot; tank (the one 
nearest the dipstick) be used for this, or will it spurt out 
everywhere?

I read the post about installing a flush tee in the heater hose up 
front, but I'm a little nervous about cutting hoses. How critical is 
a good flush? (I have not had ANY cooling problems, so I have no 
reason to think things are plugged up, etc) This is just a 
maintenance flush/fill, but first one for me.

I will starting after lunch, wish me luck! :)
