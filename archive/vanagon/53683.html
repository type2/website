Yes, I believe your local VW dealer should be able to get those for you.

My original dipstick was green plastic.  When it broke, VW supplied a
pink one with a higher oil level marked on it.  Later, when I rebuilt the 
engine, I ordered an all-steel dipstick tube and dipstick, which is the
VW part for a later model diesel Vanagon, probably an '83.  It installs
in the hole in the block between the water pump and oil filter, but
curves around so the handle part sticks out just inside the license plate 
opening.  Now, my full mark on the stick is 5.5 U.S. quarts and when I
check the oil, accuracy is not so dependent on being parked level.
