So Tim Smith says:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;My '86 is a GREAT machine, but when the sliding door is opened at 2AM, 
&gt; &gt;everyone in camp knows what YOU are doing. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; HaHa, so you pee'd out of the vent windows yet? The only solution to your 
&gt; problem that I've found is to go out the front door, just pull in on the 
&gt; door handle as you open the latch. Less of a telltale 'pop' that way. tim s.

Or.... You can get a porta-potti.
