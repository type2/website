Subject: Re: Westy in the snow &amp; ice

&gt; Rick Koller tells me that the Vanagons don't do as well in the snow because
&gt; the weight is more evenly distributed front to rear and after today's
&gt; driving I believe him.  The '78 seemed more sure-footed in the snow,
&gt; especially on acceleration.  Still, with a bit of care, the Vanagon can be
&gt; driven well and safely in the snow and ice.

I want to concur with Sean 100% on this, frankly my '81's performance 
earlier this winter on our first snow depressed me as well.  I drove 
the '78, 70 miles each day last January and was constantly impressed, 
handled incredibly, the '81 is a pig, all over the place hard to get 
traction, the steering is its only plus.  The '78 went through some 
24&quot; snow days and never missed a beat cept for the fact I froze my 
**** off.  I'm unsure how the '85 will do if I ever get it moving 
again, after all I once rolled an '86 real hard on ice.
