&gt; &gt;Just got word from my VW dealer that my 93 EV does in fact suffer from

&gt; &gt;existed.


OKAY, now it's my turn to make sure I've got this straight:

With a cold engine, my '93 EV does indeed make kind of a diesel chattering-like 
sound, especially under load, like accelerating up a hill (it disappears an a 
hot engine). If this is what Jeff (and others) experienced, and if it means 
piston slap, then I've got it too!

I have not yet got it straight--what does this mean? Is my engine going to die? 
Is there a warranty/recall repair for it? I've got almost 40K miles on it! Are 
there karma implications?  

Most importantly, my wife and I are about to pack our whole life into the EV and
drive 1300 miles back to Minnesota THIS SUNDAY. Do I need to be concerned about 
this?
