&gt; I live in  Dallas,TX. I have been to all the junk yards around haer and 
&gt; can't find a windshield for my bus. Is there any mail order house that 
&gt; carries these parts ...Please post reponse...THanks ...James
&gt; 

For a '68 bus, I believe you can use '68 through '79. You don't
usually find good windshields at a wrecking yard, and none through
mail order. New windshields here in San Diego sell for about $80.
Check the Yellow Pages in the Dallas/Ft. Worth metro area for the
foreign parts dealer (new parts) that specializes in old VWs. Here in
San Diego there are at least four chains of stores that do this.
