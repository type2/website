Subject:      about them stories ...

that one about Crossing the Sahara - Part 2 is the only part of that
series i have. i have no idea what year it was published in VW GREATS,
only that it was in that magazine, and it was in the Winter edition.

if ANYBODY has the Part 1 and/or any followup portions of that series,
i would love to have a copy.  anybody got piles of old magazines??? :)
