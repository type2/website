&gt;
&gt;Dear Digijet experts:
&gt; I have a '84 Vanagon. Last week I was driving down the highway and the
&gt;engine suddenly stalled without any warnings. I first examined the fuel
&gt;pump and it was making  a clicking noise (ie. it  was being turned on and
&gt;off repeatedly.) I tested the pump and it works fine. I tried to hardwire
&gt;the pump to see if the engine would start, but got nada. It had fuel
&gt;pressure and all of the other start-up procedures work(ie. starter,
&gt;ignition,).  I assum the control unit must be fried and is not opening the
&gt;injectors and causing the fuel pump relay to switch on and off.
&gt;Please give me any input you can.
&gt;If anyone knows who might have a used computer let me know. VW wants $600
&gt;for a new one, Parts Place says $450 for a used one. There is a local
&gt;Parts America Store that says they can order a rebuilt one for $170 after
&gt;exchange (sounds too good to be true).
&gt;Thanks Marc Rainville
&gt;
