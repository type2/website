Subject:      In the Dog House

I am considering installing an external oil cooler on my 1973 bus. I have=

been told that on the &gt;71 engines with the Dog House cooling system that =
an
external oil cooler is not neccessary, and the stock part is good enough
(for use in Europe, I live in the UK).

Can anyone explain in plain terms what a dog house cooler looks like??. M=
y
engine number starts with AD which denotes it as a '73 engine so presumab=
ly
it has got one.

I would also welcome any views/reccomendations with external oil coolers.=
 I
am currently rebuilding the engine after a No. 3 overheat/seize, so you c=
an
see why I am particularly interested in this.

Thanks in advance

Drew
