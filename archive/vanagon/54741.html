Subject: Pop Top Seal Deal - It's a Go (&amp; more info)

I got more than enough list response from the $35.50 poptop seal offer to 
go ahead with it.  If anybody else wants them, let me know.  I will 
probably order them Monday, so there's still a little time.  

Again, this is the complete set of seals for the Westfalia poptop, 
including both the pop-up and luggage rack sections. Just to repeat, since 
a couple of people asked, the seals cover the three sides where the top 
meets the side of the Westy.  The top seal (that goes horizontally across 
the roof) is NOT included (although that seal rarely goes bad anyway). 

Also, if you e-mail me, please include the year of your Westy, and your ZIP 
code (so I can let you know shipping costs).
