I had this happen to me a coupla weeks ago.  I dug out the St. Muir and it 
actually had a pretty good step-by-step trouble isolation procedure (it worked, 
eventually, for me anyway).

If you follow his procedure, you can easily either include or exclude the 
individual components (switch, starter, solenoid, battery).  Only one minor 
problem: In my case, I went through the procedure, and all indications were that 
it was the solenoid.  What it actually wound up being was the positive battery 
cable clamp being corroded.

So, what I'd recommend is, just add this check to the beginning of the 
procedure.  If you find corrosion, remove it, and if your problem goes away, 
you're done and it didn't even cost you.  If you still have the problem, go 
through the St. Muir procedure.  It should then isolate the exact component.

Good luck!
