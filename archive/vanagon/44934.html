Subject: How do I lower my late model?

I have a 1969 type II single cab pick up, it has a mild resto custom look,
and I would now like to lower it a bit (3-4inches), any advice on what method
is best, cost, and who has the parts would be greatly appreciated.  Drop
spindles would be my first choice if anyone makes them for a late model (I've
only seen them for early),  Thanks!
