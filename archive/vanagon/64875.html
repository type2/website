&lt;&lt; I had not noticed the door vents until last winter, when a list member

 that the severe condensation/icing  problem I experience on the insides
 of the rear windows in was greatly reduced. &gt;&gt;

Of course, Chris! Smart of you to open them up!

Remember folks, even in the winter, the respiration process from your body is
ditching somwhere around a pint of water per hour, (proportionally more if
your sweety and kids are with you). All that water has to go somewhere. In
the winter, the air is too cold for it to remain suspended for long, and it
quickly condenses on your windows if it can't make it's way out of the
vehicle.

As you know from earlier posts about these little vents, they are the only
wholesale way for air to escape on 68-86? vans. Later vans have little vents
near the rear windows. In the winter in particular, if you don't have A/C,
let air move into your van through the heater, let it pick up all the
moisture from your respiration &amp; from your wet feet and clothes, and then
give that moisture-laden air a way back OUT by leaving these vents open.

If you &quot;recirulate&quot; air in the winter (with the A/C off) you are capturing
every bit of moisture you brought into the car with you, making for a steamy,
foggy, moldy mess.

once again, thanks for letting me vent,
