Subject: workin' type IIs

i've been really busy the past week or so and haven't had much time to be a
computer nerd.   this happened last week:

my neighbors have an organic farm and grow herbs and such for market.   Most
of their stuff they sell at the local Farmer's Markets, but they also sell
wholesale to a nursery somewhat south ofglorious Olympia, in Woodland, closer
to Stumptown (Portland, Ore).

So they loaded up a load, including 16 flats of Blue Star Creeper, some Rue,
and a whole bunch of other stuff in one of the VW farm haulers.   the rusty
59 single cab is close to throwing a rod, the drivers door on the early 64
combi (green!) is wonky and doesn't shut right, so Brett and I and the dog
Patu took the 70 as the delivery van.   we planned to deliver the herbs, then
go up the river and check out a waterfall in the mountains, even had the
camcorder.

do you detect a note of impending doom?   everything went fine till abot
60miles south of Oly.  when, with no warning noises, black smoke started
pouring out of the passenger side air vent into the bus.    i turned around
and saw a cloud of black smoke out the back window.   Brett pulled over and
the bus stalled out.

yes, there was oil.   everything looked fine in the engine compartment.  He
tried starting it up, and black smoke came out the tailpipe.    It sounded
okay, i mean just like a motor that didn't catch.  no scary  noises like a
broken ring or bad rod.   Brett walked back to the rest area we just passed
to call for help, and i futzed with it a bit, though not expecting any great
results.    It had a good spark, gas, air, no start, black smoke.

so we hung out on the side of I-5 listening to the trucks rumbling by in the
sun for a couple hours.  It was one of those sunny summer days that those of
us in the PNW  relish.    Eventually Diana showed up with the big red truck
and the tow bar.   We hooked it up to the bus and delived a container of
herbs to the nursery!   they got a laugh out of that.

Stopped at the Pyramid brewery on the way back to Oly.    The people who work
there seem to really enjoy it, and brew some mighty tasty beer, too.

Since it was getting on in the day, we went to an Indian resturant in Little
Rock for dinner.    It was also mighty tasty.    I highly recommend it,
Maharaja's, right off I-5.    It used to be a Mexican restarant, and has lots
of neato tiles inside.

so it's not a very impressive story as a workin' type II, more a broken type
II.  but, jeez, we had fun anyway.  :)

will update you all on what went wrong when i pull the motor this weekend.

from down on the farm,
