(1) My guess is the bleeder screw on top of the rad (front right)
is leaky - maybe just loose - dont be a gorilla and f* up your rad -
just get it snug...

(2) I had to put these on my 83 - they were only about $2 a piece -
from the dealer - i know you just ate an engine but i hope you
can afford that  :-)  (snide remark about convex salries deleted ...)


I actually have some spares but not a clue where they are - if you wait
\a couple if i find will send


WELCOME BACK NUBUS !!!!!


obviously a spouse with fine tastes in all things including automobiles btw

sps
