Subject:      Blowing smoke...

Well, I just paid almost $600 to get my 1980 westy fixed, and now all of a
sudden it is blowing smoke.  As soon as it started doing it I parked it,
and afraid to drive it.  I just had the main seal replaced, and a few
other parts replaced.  It does seem to shudder just a little too.  Just
not the same ever since I got it back from the shop.

If anyone has any ideas about it blowing smoke, it would really help me
figure out what to do.  I'm starting to feel so helpless about this
engine. But I love my van so much, such a dillema.

Kyle
