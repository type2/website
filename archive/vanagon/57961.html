Subject: thank you

Thanks to all the folks who sent information on getting the fridge running.
Shawn reminded me it had to be nearly level so I took my carpenter's level
to the garage (which has a sloping floor - I keep forgetting), jacked up the
back end and the fridge worked just fine.  Now if I could just get the LED
indicator to work when it is on live would be simpler and I wouldn't have to
go to the chiropractor every time I try to look in that little window!
