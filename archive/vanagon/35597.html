Subject: Re: Isetta = VW ?


The Isetta was built under license by BMW. The original Isetta was designed 
and initially built by an Italian firm, I believe ISO. During the late 50s 
and early 60s VW manufactured parts showed up not only in other German 
automobiles, but also amusement park rides. I remeber seeing VW steering 
wheels on those kiddie-car rides at the local amusement park.
