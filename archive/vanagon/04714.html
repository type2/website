Randy,

I assume since you describe 'bolts and gaskets' rather than 'exhaust clamps'
your talking about a type four motor?  ....Okay ..... somewhere a long lost
memory tells me that this is one of those things that should be simple but can
take hours....

Beem a long time since I've done one of these but from memory I think the trick
is to actually remove some of the tin at the front (i.e., fan end) of the
engine.  This allows you to access the top bolt which runs into a little
crevice on top of the heat exchanger.  It adds a little time but from what I
remember it is impossible to undo and adequately tighten this top bolt with the
tin there...even after moving the tin it's one of those 1/8 of a turn at a time
jobs.  Anybody else?  I can't remember whether the tin fronting the alternator
has to come off or not ?....

Rob K.
