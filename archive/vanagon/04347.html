Subject: left parking, running lights are dead!
Date: Tue, 20 Sep 1994 18:36:25 -0700 (PDT)

Hello Everyone,

I have had my fuse block down in my '84 a few times to install an audio
amp in the the correct was wiring wise and now my driver's side parking
and running lights no longer work.  I have looked at the connections on
the back of the fuse block without sucess.  No current at the bulb.

I am thinking about running a jumper from the right side to the left side
to remedy this problem.  Does anyone see any problem with this?  I
understand the fuse load will be higher but not outside of designed ranges.

Thanks,

Alan
