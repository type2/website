Ok here it goes...
	I'm in need of the Bentley manual for an 84 Vanagon.
	Does anyone have a used (greasy) copy that they no
	longer need and wouyld like to sell?? (yeah right...
	and your right arm also).  I am also looking for the
	September 93 issue of VW trends Apparently it has an article
	pertaining to adjusting fuel mixtures.  Looking for a
	copy of the article. (man I'm cheap).

		Thanks
