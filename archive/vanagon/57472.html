Subject: Installed VDO/PSI Gauge = oil light on at idle?

Man what a time I have had installing this dam gauge(also added volt oil
temp). Used all VDO parts, included the rubber hose used to isolate the
sending unit out and away from the push rod tubes. Had to make a special
tool to install it! When I called VDO tech. Service and explained the
problem, this goober told me to carry it the VW dealer-gees,what an
incompetent idiot!. I ask him it he was kidding-his answer was a serious
no! Must be hard to get good help these days.

To the point the sending unit from VDO is set for 7 PSI and the stock
sender is 4.4psi for an 1985 and back vanagon. So when the oil gets hot and
the engine drops to idle, the oil light comes on even tho the gauge is
showing pressure.
Called VDO tech service again, said that he had never heard of this problem
(Different dud-at least he did'nt tell me to carry it to the VW
dealer!)Suggested I move the sender down lower on the engine, since I have
it mounted near the top rear.Hate to move it because its in a good place
well away from the exhaust.

?'s list-- What is the minimum PSI the boxer should show at idle? (Wonder
if I may need to rebuild the oil pump=130K?) Oh coarse with the original
sender the light never came on at idle. So the PSI must be between
4-7.(hard to say on the gauge-but somewhere in that range)

Anyone ran into this problem?

Not on the list for now, busy starting/moving to a new job in Boulder - any
vangon listers in or around Boulder?
