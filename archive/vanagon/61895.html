Subject: tools

Hello;  As a Heavy duty mechanic in a BC coast logging camp for 17 years, I
have,long ago, come to appreciate the value of quality tools. My favorite
flex handle is the one made by snap-on with the 28 inch handle.  Over the
years I've had a 6 foot pipe on that sucker more times than I can remember
and it has never failed.  Other mechanics on my shift come to me to borrow
it after they have broken theirs.  Now I realize that most readers will
never need a tool as &quot;professional&quot; as this one, but there are those of you
out there who must have the very best, this is it.  Personally I don&quot;t care
for Craftsman tools, they tear the skin off my hands with their raised
ridges.  I usually wear cotton gloves when I know I'm going to have to pull
hard on a hand tool.    Larry Carter           87 GL
