Subject: Re: '71 Westy On Fire! (what went wrong?)

something grounded
&gt;out and suddenly there was a cloud of black smoke. I sat there stunned, and
&gt;then realized I had better put the fire out, or get the heck out of the van!
&gt;Once I saw the flame, though, I wasn't worried. Only about 2 inches high - I
&gt;blew it out...
&gt;
&gt;The wierd thing is that although the ground to the stereo was completely
&gt;fried, I couldn't find anything positive in the area that it could have
&gt;grounded to - the ignition was off, and investigating with a test light
&gt;turned up nothing in the vicinity -

ALWAYS disconnect the battery. Takes a minute, but will prevent any mishaps.
