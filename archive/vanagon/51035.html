Subject: Tires still again

Well, after searching the archives and consulting with the Michelin folks
at their 800 number, it appears that Michelin's replacement for the XZX
185R14 Reinforced tire is the new Reinforced MX 185R14. Earlier posts
indicated that several people may have bought these. Any feedback yet on
performance, wear, etc?
