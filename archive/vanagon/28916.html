Subject: Vanagon recalls and VWoA

Is there any way to deterine if a particular vehicle has or has not been
serviced for factory recalls? Does VWoA keep a database that they will
check for you?

Will VWoA perform free recall work only for original owners upon receipt of
recall letter?

Thanks,
Mark McCulley
