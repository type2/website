SNIP--SNIP

&gt;I then took out the FI black box behind the rear right tail light. 
&gt;Cracking it open revealed a lot of potential questions.  There were a 
&gt;lot of components that had black spots.  One black component that 
&gt;looked like a voltage regulator (thin approx. 1/16 thick x .3 x .4) 
&gt;with 3 prongs was blackened on the circuit board as well as itself 
&gt;:(.  Bunch of the 3.3 uF capacitors are leaking yellow stuff, etc... 
&gt;Does anyone have access to a circuit diagram for this baby? Or can 
&gt;anyone look at their box to tell me what the specs could be for the 
&gt;rectifier so I could replace the burned components.  Some of the 
&gt;Motorola ICs (LM2902N L8625) have distorted spots on them making me 
&gt;question their usefulness.  As you all probably know, the dealer 
&gt;would love to see me walk in asking for one of these boxes!
&gt;

The idle speed valve is the culprit in the majority of damaged control
units. When the valve quits humming the control units works itself slowly to
death. The moral here; when the idle speed valve first starts to hang up
from carbon and/or crud clean it then now later. Or perhaps you like
spending extra money &lt;g&gt;. Come to think of it, it's probably a good idea to
simply clean the valve on a regular basis. Say perhaps once a year/10-15k.


Have a Merry Christmas
