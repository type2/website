I forgot to mention that there's a place called Oval's [(206) 874-8290] that
sells West Coast Metric stuff (that's the place from which I would have
ordered the $81 German seals) for about 70-80% of list price. That
would take you down to about $60. But it's COD, cash only, and US only.

Thanks go to Eric Oster for the info.
