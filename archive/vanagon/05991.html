Subject: RE: generator article (another viewpoint on electricity :)


	Oh gee, Peter, if you're keeping three generations happy in
a bus, you're doing better than I've ever seen possible. I'll consider
this the next time there is a generator going at a near-by-campside.


	Which reminds me of a funny story. Although not themselves fans
of an often-stigmatized rock band, my brother and his wife got one of
their friends who *is* a Deadhead to buy them a &quot;fukinruvin!&quot; sticker
for their 88 Vanagon. (It looks like a &quot;farfignugen&quot; stiker, but the 
stick figure is dancing rather than driving.)
	They were peacefully eating dinner one night in Arizona when a 
couple of older persons from the motorhome in the next site came over. They 
were from the Netherlands and had been trying to figure out what language 
&quot;fukingruvin&quot; was, and what it meant.
	Although never expecting to have to explain their joke sticker to
retired persons for whom English was not a first language, my brother
and sister in law rose to the occasion. It took about two minutes for the 
background of the joke to be explained and the older couple laughed, thanked
them and returned to their site. About two more minutes passed and the site 
errupted in laughter as the rest of their party was brought up to speed.

	Moral: Don't sell anyone short, especially at a campsite.
