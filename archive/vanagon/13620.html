Subject: Re: Anybody know about....

&gt;2)  &lt;slash&gt; thing...incl. the rain gutter clips?  I may be nuts, but I'd 
like &gt;to try and fabricate my own sometime.  Some wholesale canvas and many 
hours of 
&gt;labour later...maybe I can start a cottage industry.

Glad to measure mine up, for FAQ and all, BUT there is 2' of snow around, so 
you'll need to wait, a month. The 'clips' on the tent I have is actually a 
12' (twelve feet) long fat vinyl strip which molds onto the rain gutter, 
absolutely water/wind tight. Try to find this stuff, the tent flap is 
stitched to it.


&gt;	3.	Replacing the louvered (sic) windows in a 79(or earlier) 
&gt;Westy with solid or sliding glass windows from an early 80's Vanagon 
&gt;based Westy? 

Older Westy windows are a snap to remove, just lots of screws. Take out the 
old one, cut cardboard to fit exactly, then compare to the new windows, I 
think the new ones are taller. If it is a go, maybe check an auto glass 
place for 'slow day pricing' they  might be worth it, especially if leaks 
develop.

&gt;
&gt;	4. Restarting a stored VW aircooled fuel injected engine that has
&gt;sat dormant for 5 months through a Canadian (albiet mildish)winter.  I
&gt;took out the battery, and added a fuel line anti freeze with the last fill
&gt;up, but I did not remove either the oil or the sparkplugs.  Should I take
&gt;'em out (the plugs) and give the cylinders a small dose of WD-40 before
&gt;attempting ignition?  Please advise.... 
&gt;
Pull the plugs, spray in WD-40, and turn the motor over a couple of times BY 
HAND, easiest way is to put it in 3rd. gear, jack up a rear wheel and turn 
that. Don't force anything. If all is smooth, (take it off the jack!) turn 
it over with the starter, until the oil light goes out. Still smooth? Put in 
the plugs and try it. There will be lots of spare gas kicking around, smoke 
etc, but it should clear. Treat it gently &lt;3000RPM for a short jaunt, then 
change the oil and filter when you get back. I can't see you having any 
problems after 5 months, aside from noisy hydraulic lifters, which should 
clear with patience.   tim s.
