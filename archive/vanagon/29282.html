Subject: Back on the road with Opie

Opie ('68 crew cab) &amp; I are back on the road.  We still haven't settled with 
the insurance company but it was time to get on with life.  

I rebuilt all brake cylinders and replaced the shoes last week.  When I saw 
the other car in the parking lot backing towards me I nailed the brakes and 
horn.  Everything worked, but afterwards, in the tire bay, I noticed brake 
fluid leaking from the right rear wheel.  When I got ready to go and checked 
the reservoir it was still ok.  I cautiously drove back to work, but found 
that every time I applied the brakes, I was pumping fluid out the rear 
cylinder.  I stopped and filled the reservoir twice to get back to work and 
finally home.

What I discovered was that in hitting the brakes hard, the seal on one of 
the right rear pistons split and the fluid was being pumped out past the 
dust seal.  I guess I can assume the master cylinder is in good shape.

Now with new shoes and rebuilt cylinders the brakes are better than ever.  I 
can, however, fully agree with the post that we gradually get used to less 
than new braking over time.  I plan on adding brake adjustment to my 
scheduled maintenance, kinda like 3 months or 3000 miles.  I mean, I'm under 
there all dirty anyway from doing the valves.......

BTW - the BIG socket set from Harbor Freight worked great.  That 46mm nut 
was not a problem.  Thanks to Bradley for the sale price - he saved me $6 
plus shipping.
