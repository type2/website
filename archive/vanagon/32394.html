Subject: Re: Early bus

     &gt;I need a little info regarding early bus window rubber.  I need to 
     &gt;replace one front windshield in both my '56 &amp; '67 busses.  Who makes 
     &gt;the best rubber?
     &gt;Is it the same rubber for both busses?  TIA
     
     There are lots of different seal makers. I used a combination of 
     'Volksrub' ones and West Coast Metric ones.
     
     I used Volksrub ones for the windshields and they worked just fine, no 
     leaks at all. I used WCM for the popout seals because I found that 
     Volksrub ones seemed to 'full' and therefore made the window difficult 
     to close and open.
     
     Volksrub is a local UK manufacturer that makes seals for most 
     aircooled vw's. 
     
     Lee.
