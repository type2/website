A year or so back the Tappet Bros. stated (in their newspaper column) 
that buying an old VW Bus was &quot;not a groovy idea, man&quot;.  The also said 
&quot;From a purely practical point of view you couldn't possibly have come up 
with a worse idea.  But we're not even going to try to talk you out of 
it, because we know it's hopeless.&quot;  They also thought that &quot;a camper is 
a very good idea.  That way when it breaks down by the side of the road, 
you can just say, 'We'll camp here!'&quot;.
