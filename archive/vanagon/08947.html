Subject: Epilogue:  Trouble after rebuild

Never Mind.  All better now.

 :-)


OK, OK.  You guys can all thrash me severely about the head and 
shoulders.  I deserve it.

As a lesson to all would-be engine rebuilders, tighten the !_at_#$%
gland nut.  Tight.  I mean, break-your-ratchet tight.  Tight!

My flywheel came loose, and the excess thrust was causing all the 
bad noises from the case.  By the time I got home from my trip I 
was getting bad vibrations from the clutch, and during shifts it 
sounded like the engine was coming apart.

I pulled the engine this morning.  The torque did a number on
the dowel holes in the crank and flywheel, but I decided to go
ahead and reassemble it as is.  I probably should have bought a
new flywheel without reamed-out holes.  I had to get some 
more shims from the store, I suspect because the excess thrust
hammered away at the bearings.  I also retorqued the heads while 
I had it out.

Anyway, she runs as smooth as a sewing machine now.  Thanks 
everyone for your advice and offers of help.  I promise not to
make this mistake ever again.  And I'm extremely happy I didn't
have to open the case again.
