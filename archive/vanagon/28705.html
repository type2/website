Subject: Re: Insulating a bus ceiling

Bob, All,
	When I got my '67 bus 10 years ago it had no headliner, nothing 
on the ceiling.  It was very loud and had all of the problems that 
uninsulaated steel boxes have.  I ended up buying two hot water heater 
insulating blankets and &quot;hung&quot; them from the ceiling with narrow wood 
slatts screwed end to end across the metal bows in the roof.  The 
blankets were just the right thickness to fill the headliner space in the 
ceiling.  They also have a plastic cover on them which means that you 
are not looking at fiberglass and the plastic has held up for ten years.  
The wooden slats are actually very attractive, giving the ceiling almost 
a wooden canoe look.  The wood slats can be unscrewed from the &quot;bows&quot; and 
the insulation can be pulled out for inspection, rust control.  Camping 
at 0*F, I do notice the exposed metal bows to be cold spots.  They get 
covered with frost.  But I am happy with the amount of heat this helps 
hold in.  In the ceiling above the driver, passenger, I glued gym mat 
material.
	This insulation job has held up well and cost less than $30 ten 
years ago.  Of course, it is not going to give anywhere near the 
sound/heat insulating qualities of urethane foam, but it took only a 
couple hours to install and is easily removed.
