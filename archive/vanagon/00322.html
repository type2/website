Subject: Catalina 2500 Add-a-room?

I have an '86 Westfalia and I put a Dometic Catalina 2500 awning on it. A 
very nice awning even though Dometic increased the price on it all out of 
proportion. Anyway, I have been looking for a Carefree or other add-a 
room that would fit it - no luck. Dometic says that they don't sell 
enough of them to develop one - haven't and don't intend to.
Anyone got some information on something that would actually work?
