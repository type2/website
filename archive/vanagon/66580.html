Subject:      83 Watercooled, Smelling Gas and Hearing Popping Sounds

I just purchased a 83 watercooled.  I am still nervous after having a
Vanagon air cooled.

After driving for several minutes I start hearing a popping misfiring
sound while sitting still.  Curious to where I should begin in repairing
this.

Also I smell raw gas smell upon exiting vehicle.  Any clues?

Alan
