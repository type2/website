Subject: RE: 76 pop-top canvas

I *love* my '76 Campmobile! Good choice! Does your have its folding table
intact? All I've got is a bracket. Check in either of the big VW magazines, I'm
positive I've seen replacement canvas offered there, maybe $100, maybe less,
maybe more... bet it's going to be a job to install, though.

Hi all,

I am going to check out a 76 camper on Friday, and the owner
tells me that the canvas is gone from it.  Being new to buses
and campers, I assume that this is just the exterior sheath
to the pop top, but I wasn't completely sure what he was
describing.  Anyway, can anyone give me an idea of what it
might cost to get a replacement, mail-order or otherwise?
It sounds like a pretty sound car otherwise (recent rebuild,
lots of other recent work), but I want to know beforehand what
I am getting myself into.

Thanks for any help.
