Subject: Parts for Sale [Syncro Center Driveshaft FS]
Date: Wed, 11 Jun 1997 21:32:47 -0400

I have a great used center driveshaft for sale. It came out of the 87'
syncro I'm parting out and has very little mileage on it. It was one of the
last things they replaced before pulling the engine. [Spread the word :-)]
I also have other vanagon parts from that van, check out my page for more
info...

Pictures of everyone (and their vans) who stopped by my place on Sunday
will also be on the page shortly. Everyone except &quot;vwbus&quot; who came on
Saturday, good thing too, as he had a real silly looking sliding door :-)
