I was just thinkin' with the prune sticker idea in mind.
How's about a Prune sticker that has a made up company name
like: 

    &quot;Gerry &amp; Joel's Prunes and Type II's&quot;
      (Comes in handy flannel pack too!)

or 

    &quot;Prunes for Type II drives&quot;
    (In handy flannel pack!)

;)
