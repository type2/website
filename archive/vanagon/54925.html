   I have an 87 Syncro in which I've been driving around the US for six
months. While I'm on Cape Cod licking my wounds, I'd like to drop another
thousand or two into keeping the van running. I may have Dennis do it (Hey
Dennis!), but I'd like to know if there's a guru around here. Any tips
appreciated.
                                                             Thanks,
                                                              Rob Halligan
