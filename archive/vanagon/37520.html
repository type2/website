&gt;I've run into a little problem in trying to hook the radio up.  
&gt;I've found the power lead (black w. fuse) and the speaker wires, but 
&gt;there's a thick blue wire that I can't figure.  The antenna is the 
&gt;ground, isn't it???  The radio works without the blue wire hooked up, 
&gt;but if anyone has an idea of what it might be for, I'd sure like to 
&gt;know.

&gt;Thanks!

Knowing nothing about the radio, I'd guess that the extra wire might be
for a light.  You'd hook it into the rest of the dash lights so it would come
on when you turned the headlights on.  But that would be a THIN wire, not
a thick one, you'd think.
