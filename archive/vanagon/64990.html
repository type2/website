Subject:      Seeking Advice on Engine Rebuilders

Hi,
   I am seeking advice on a rebuilt engine.  My shop has informed that
after 200,000 plus miles my 84 Vanagon engine is in need of rebuilding.
They indicated that they were willing to do it, but that I might save
money if I bought an long block and they installed it.  With that in
mind, I am hoping for some advice on some of the places that sell
rebuilds (including VW).  Who does good work and is willing to stand
behind their work?  Likewise, who are places to avoid?  Also, would
there be any obstacles to moving up to a 2.1L engine from a 1.9L?
I welcome any advice that you want to share with me.  Private email
is fine if you don't want to post to the list.

   I am sure that this has been covered in the past, but I can't find
a way to search the archives.  If someone can help me out there, I
would appreciate it.

Thanks,
Ken Hovey
