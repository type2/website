I use a Yakima rack system (crossbars) to carry a 17ft Mad River canoe and
a Yakima Rocket Box (roof top carrier) on an '86 Westy. Mount the cross
bars well apart for maximum high speed stability.  The Yakima racks require
you to mount small brackets on the side of the fiberglass top. Make sure
you use some large washers under the mounting nuts.  I found it to be a
superior rack system - safe and convenient to use. I have carried a canoe
at 75+ MPH with no problems. Yakima racks are expensive but worth it in the
long run.

The cross bars for the canoe are spaced far apart and thus I had to add a
third cross bar when I got the Rocket Box. I use the rocket box to carry
paddles, wet life jackets, tents, etc- it holds alot. You can't lift the
Westy top with the canoe in place, but you can lift it with the Rocket Box
in place if you position it as far toward the rear as possible (eg.
overhanging the rear of the van).

E-mail at rpn_at_helix.nih_dot_gov if you additional info.
