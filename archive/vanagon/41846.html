Subject: Re: Will these wheels work on my '63 Bus?

For Ron Salmon and the rest of the list -

I have been running those 15x5.5 Chrome Rims on my '67 Deluxe now for over 20
years without a single problem (I'm the original owner - since June '67).
 One thing to note however - I wouldn't run tires that are larger then 195x15
(70 series).  I ran 205's very briefly when I encountered that the front's
would rub against the rear portion of the front tire well when I'd hit the
brakes (even gently).  Had to switch 'em to 195's.  205's work OK in the
rear, tho it gets real tight like Jon said in his post.  Price of $140 sounds
OK, as we have to sell 'em here at Bus Boys for $59 each (new) and we don't
make very much on 'em - we only make $15 apiece.  But I've seen 'em at the VW
shows and swaps going for as little as $15 apiece.

my .005 cents worth :)  Jim / BusBoys_at_aol_dot_com
