Hi,

	I think 1800 is WAY #_at_! to much for that bus.

	Thigs to look at:

		How are the rocker panels? Do they feel solid? Give 'em a 
good rap with your knuckles.  

		How's the battery tray?  This can be a pain in the butt
if its all rusted out, but it can be fixed.  Good way to get the 
price down.

		How are the windows; are the all popouts, campers or what;
what condition are they in.  This may not matter to most people,
but i prefer the popouts, and I despise the camper windows (you know,
the ones with the louvers.

	On the steering, here's hopw you can check it.  Have a buddy
get in and turn the wheel slowly back and forth.  You watch the parts
underneath and see what moves and where the play is.  A new draw link
(cause you can't just put in a new bushing) will run you about $45
plus an hour or so to install.  The steering box can be adjusted by 
loosening the 19mm nut on the right side, and tightening the screw
underneath it.  if you do it too much, it will bind.  If it binds, and
it there is still too much play, you need a rebuilt box.  $350 here
in cali from bus boys, but I have a good rebuilt one from my '67  
I'd be happy to get rid of :)

	Out here in Cali, busses seem to be over priced.  However, I 
just bought a '56 in similar condition to what you described, minus
battery and with a marginal clutch, and with a good tranny, for 
$400.  Out here, someone could probably get $800 to $1000 for your 
'64.

	If you need any more help or have any questions, email me direct.
