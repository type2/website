Subject: Re: 4WD Breadloaves

     You can do it! All the basic details are worked out and published
     on the Web! Dave LaTourette has a 4WD Pro-Rally bug that starts with a
     breadloaf engine and transmission, then adds some Japanese and Swedish
     parts up front...

     Check it out at  http://weber.u.washington_dot_edu/~tourette/.
