Subject: Re: Syncro CV Madness..

&gt;Hi Everyone.  I made a few enquiries regarding CV boots and joints 
&gt;for a 1990 Syncro,
&gt;rear axle            $208.90 each   all four joints same price.
&gt;

Harry...... I can get you rebuilt axles front and/or rear at $140CDN each 
plus core. This makes for $560Cdn total +taxes + installation. Let me know 
if you want their phone #. Rears are relatively easy to swap, fronts appear 
very awkward.



&gt;I also enquired how much it costs to get the CV-Joints repacked.  
&gt;They (VW) say 2.8 hours labour per axle.  A syncro has 4 axles.  The 
&gt;labour rate is $75/hr, and then there are steel bands, and extra bits 
&gt;&amp; pieces to do the job along with grease, etc.  Total bill for all 
&gt;four axles is $820 labour, plus bits.... so $900 would be the bill.
&gt;

Squawk!!!  find out their re/re costs and hav'em put in the rebuilts.
repacking conveys no warranty, which the rebuilts do have.


&gt;Would this be worth to do or let the pieces fail and replace as you 
&gt;go?  Any advice would be appreciated.  So far with 114000 km (around 
&gt;70000 miles) there have been no problems with the joints on my van, 
&gt;and they have never been opened.

If they are quiet, boots are intact etc. then leave them alone. Maybe try to 
pack some additional grease in via large hypodermic under the axle end of 
the boots, remove the clamps, inject grease, and massage into the joint. 
I've had no probs. at 163,000Km on a 2WD '85, which spent 4 years of it's 
life in downtown Toronto stop and go potholed tram track roads. No granny 
gear though. tim s.
