&gt; While we're on the subject, how do people determine how much propane
&gt; they have in their tank? I thought about putting some kind of pressure
&gt; guage in the propane plumbing system so I could monitor usage - until
&gt; then, determining when to refill remains an art...

I asked around about the gauges and even asked the local RV place that
services the Dometic fridges to see if he could put a guage in.  He
didn't seem to be to keen on it and said after looking at the setup
that it would not fit.  I've asked other places that have LP supplies
and they don't think the guages are very accurate.  I kind of gave up
on the guage thing.
