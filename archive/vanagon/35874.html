Subject: New Show Date for NH

Hi all. Just a quick note that the New Hampshire VW Club Show originally
slated for June 9 has been rescheduled to June 30, at the Hopkington
Fairgrounds. Camping will most likely be availabe the night before. More
details as they become available. Hope to see at least some of you there!
By then all the snow should be gone!
