Subject: DANGER: Use JACKSTANDS!

hey now,

just want to remind all you folks that a floor jack is not enought to ensure
your safety when working under your bus. i had a VERY close call today. i was
running a short piece of wire for a sending unit and figured i could just use
the jackstand since it would only take a minute. *wrong* i had just crawled out
from under the bus when i heard a cracking sound and the bus *fell* to the
ground. a few minutes earlier and i would have been *crushed*. seems that the
asphalt under the front wheels of the floor jack..which was chocked..crumbled
and the jack went sideways. i've learned my lesson and thankfully i'm okay.
i was stupid and luckily walked away. PLEASE use jackstands. the time you take
to set them up may save your life or prevent serious injury.
