Subject: scrounged heads

Hi all,

I wanted to get a seconed set of dp heads for my bus. Would it be a false
economy to scrounge up some used ones? What should I look for? Cracks
around the spark plug hole and valve seats, anything else?

Since I want to re-build them myself, I don't see why I should have to buy
new ones.

Oh, yeah. What is the fair market value of a pair of re-buildable heads?

Thanks again,
Ken
