&gt; I have been driving 50 miles a day commuting with my vanagon for a year.
&gt; That is too much a waste for vanagon miles. Maybe it's time to get a Jetta?

I test-drove a Jetta with a VR6. I loved it. I can't afford it. I cried.

By the way, I've driven past Vanagons like they were standing still in 
my FOX GL. Those tiny little things have plenty of umph in the midrange
to pass heavy lumbering beasts.
