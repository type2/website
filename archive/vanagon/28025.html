&gt; 
&gt; Found one of these on a '74 bug engine in COlorado. It's a connection
&gt; for an EGR valve. First time I've ever heard of one on a '73. Maybe that's
&gt; A california engine (did '73 California engines even have them?), or
&gt; maybe somebody put it on from a '74 engine, to put the engine in a '74
&gt; CA bug and pass emissions tests? Or maybe that's really a '74 bug engine
&gt; (rebuilt at some point with a '73 case?).
&gt; 
&gt; To my (limited) knowledge, '74 bug engines were the only year to have this.

 I used to work on a friend's '73 type 181 &lt;&quot;Thing&quot;&gt; It had EGR, but was
 also a CA car.
