  John &amp; List members,

  Well, these Pipes are the DANSK pipes.

  I do Understand the problems that there have been in the past.

  I work in a VW shop and We install these pipes.  There was a batch of 
1.9 Pipes that were Awful, they fit like S--- and the couple that we Did 
install we had to heat up and tweak them a bit:(

  We didn't stop installing these pipes, but we did cringe everytime we 
had to install them after those FEW Poorly fitting ones we did install! 
 We've had all good ones since that One batch of Funky ones about 1 year 
ago.

  I'm not sure if there was a New guy in the plant or ??

  I know that the cost of these pipes are alot less than the VW Pipes.

  I encurage any and All comments on this topic.
  
    I also know that the people with the 2.1 engines that have welded  
and re-welded their pipes will be happy to see that there Is an 
alternative to the Dealer Cost of the pipes!
