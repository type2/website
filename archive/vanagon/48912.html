Subject: RE: Diesel Transmission

&gt; 
&gt; I do have a query for the list.  I have the option of having a syncro
&gt; locker installed in my transmission for abouyt the same price as the Weddle
&gt; Locker.
&gt; Any comments regarding installing this locker on a 2-wheel drive vanagon?
&gt;

      The Syncro lock axle is not a bolt-in installation. THere is AL 
      welding , Machining, Re-engineering of the case. Someone on the 
      list has a supplier for a limited slip axle. I think it is
      a bolt in installation. This is whats going in my syncro next
      time the Transmission is out.
