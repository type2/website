&gt; &gt;&gt; I need to replace the tires on my '60 micro and don't know the correct 
&gt; &gt;&gt; size. Anybody out there know? 
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I know that there is a fact list out there on this, but the original size 
&gt; &gt;was a 6.40 x 15 which I believe is about the same diameter of a 205/75 x 
&gt; &gt;15.  It is important to note that when folks complain about the low 
&gt; &gt;gearing of their older buses that the original tires were a few inches 
&gt; &gt;taller than the bug's which are often installed on the older splitties.
&gt; 
&gt; I always thought that the metric sizes referred to width in mm.  Then the 75 
&gt; means that the profile is 75% of the preceeding number.  In that case, 
&gt; 205mm/25.4=8.1 in.  Pretty far from 6.4 in.  So: 6.4*25.4=162.56 or 165mm.
&gt; 
&gt; Any of this make sense?

Okay, here I go, I have my Coker tire brochure in front of me this time:

6.40 x 15 (very old sizing method from the 50's &amp; 60's):
Overall diameter = 26.88&quot;

Michelin 165R15 (European sizing method):
Overall diameter = 25.4&quot;
