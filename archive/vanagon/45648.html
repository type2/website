Subject: Interesting T4 seating (was RE: 9-pass vanagons)


Now that James has brought it up (10 pass T4s) here are some interesting 
passenger layouts:

Double Cab T4 Vans (yes D/C vans), behind the middle seat is a combination 
wall divider and &quot;locker&quot;. These are 5 passenger units, and come in either a 
SWB or LWB version.


10 Seater T4 vans - SWB - two types, each having two seats in the driver's 
compartment, and a three seat middle seat. The first version has a sideways 
three passenger seat along the rear on the driver's side, across from which 
are two single jump seats. The second version has the traditional fowrard 
facing rear seat with two jump seats in the luggage compartment.

10 Seater T4 vans - LWB - two types, each having two seats in the driver's 
compartment, and a three seat middle seat. Version one then has a two seat 
unit behind the middle seat and a three passenger (forward facing) seat in 
the very back. Version two - three passenger seat behind the  middle seat, 
and a two passenger, sideways seat, in the far back.


11 and 12 seat units. From what I can determine from the Norweigan T4 
catalogue, one can &quot;special order&quot; a 11 seat SWB van by ordering the full 
bench seat in the front...or a 12 seat version by either ordering the full 
bench seat in the front OR a full width third seat in the version with the 
three rows of rear seats.


Hmmmmm....
