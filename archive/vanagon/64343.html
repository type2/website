&gt; I don't know this for sure, but it may be something to look into.
&gt; Has anyone ever seen a Van with these fender flares AND the fiberglass rocker
&gt; mouldings??
&gt; Todd Francis, does your Tri Star have both??


 Hi The Tristar has black plastic fender flares and is painted flat
black on the bottom (from the lower body crease or groove that goes down
the side that is 8&quot; up from the bottom)(burgandy top)instead of the bolt
on rocker mouldings. Looks good. I need to get some pictures taken so I
can send them to the web.
