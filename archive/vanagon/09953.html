Subject: REALLY good Bus Books

  Let me start by saying that I am not connected to Classic motorbooks,
but am only a VERY satisfied customer. Ijust got in the mail last night
3 books from them I had ordered. 2 are compilations of magazine and
technical articles about busses; One for splits, and one for Late
Models. These books are a definate must for any enthusiast. There are
incredible pictures and articles from the time periods of these busses.
There are several comparison articles (very detailed) between VW, Chevy,
Ford and Dodge. Vw does come out pretty well. There are articles on
various camper conversions, with actually a lot of Left-hand drive
pictures. One of my favorites is an article detailing all the different
ways you can order your custom &quot;truck&quot;, where they show a fire truck
(ladder truck), a portable milking machine truck, an actual hydraulic
dumping single-cab, high-roof &quot;weenie wagon&quot; and all in all some 80
different choices. I highly recommend at least calling for their free
catalog, but I am highly satisfied. BTW, the books are soft-bound, and
only like $17.00 each.
