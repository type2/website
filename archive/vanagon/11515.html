Subject: Re: 84 vanagon engine troubles

&gt;
&gt;I have a 1984 VW Vanagon that needs some work...

Yes, The heads will probably need to be replaced...
I too have an 84' that is leaking coolant and oil and will need to replace
the head gaskets (and if the heads are pitted the heads as well) Total price 
for mine
is $890 for the head gaskets and if the heads need replacing then add about 
$800 more.
This is Chicago costs too. But, such is love....
 



&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Perseverance my child....it's a Vanagon&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
