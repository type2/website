Subject: M-Codes Revisited

&gt;Subject: M-Codes Revisited

&gt;Whoever it was that asked me to email the M-codes to them so
&gt;they can set them up on a web page, ask again because I
&gt;misplaced your address.  I have it in raw unsorted form for
&gt;you, if you don't mind cleaning it up.

There may be someone else, but I will take them too.  Raw,
well done, or once over lightly.

&gt;Jim, if your Westy is a walk-thru, I think 425 may be
&gt;walk-thru seat belts, as that was the common thread for my
&gt;buses with that code.

My '67 Westy is non-walk-thru.

&gt;Anyone out there want to solve some option mysteries?
&gt;Anyone have mysteries that need to be solved?

I just love a good mystery.

&gt;These are the buses I had access to &amp; codes I looked up last
&gt;night...

&gt;Dave
