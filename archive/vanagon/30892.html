&gt;Yeah, I wrote the company.  But why is it that I got this feeling we'll still
&gt;see this piece of crap in their catalog ten years from now?  Anyone with a
&gt;lick of sense knows better than to sell a CAST IRON hammer, so if they're
&gt;selling the things it's a good bet you'd have to hit them over the head with
&gt;a squadron of lawyers to get their attention.
&gt;
&gt;This is a dangerous tool, fellers.  If you got one, throw it away, cuz it
&gt;won't give you any warning before it tries to kill you.

Just outa curiosity (and maybe to start a new thread), can you tell from
the casting, etc. where that puppy was made?
