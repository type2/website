Subject: Re: Ebberschlaber heater don't work...

What happens when you turn on the heater? Is the engine running? Have you
reset the safety relay tucked in the area behind the glove box? What
happens now? Do you hear any fans running? Can you hear a continuous tick
noise from under the van?

&gt;about these things but if there was juice going to the coil wouldn't the
&gt;fuel pump for the heater be working too?  any help would be appreciated.
