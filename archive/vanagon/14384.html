Subject: RE: Out comes the motor...

  I poked around last night for a few minutes surveying what I will have to
do
&gt;  to remove the engine from my '74 Westy. Can anyone tell me whether it is 
&gt;  easier to remove the engine and transmission together, as a unit - which
would
&gt;  go more or less straight down -  or to take the engine out by itself -
back 
&gt;  and down - . There doesn't appear to be much room behind the engine to
pull
&gt;  it clear of the transmission input shaft. Has anyone tried it both ways?


Although popular opinion seems to be with dropping the donk only I have done
it both ways and IMO its actually easier to pull the whole lot (engine with
tin intact and transmission) and break it on the floor.  I  do this with a
bottle jack, and a flat trolley (in lieu of purchasing on the those big floor
jacks - one day).  


The Easter swells are also hitting Bells.  Six to eight foot over the last
week Off shore very morning! Gees I Iove going to work some days *GNASH*
