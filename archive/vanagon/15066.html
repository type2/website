&gt; All this talk about cracked heads and leaking head gaskets is starting to get

&gt; what's the typical trouble-free lifespan for an aircooled Vanagon engine?
&gt; 

My heads and gaskets were replaced 20k miles ago at 133k miles.  I just got 
word that VW is willing to cover 80% of my cost of gaskets that just went 
out. So that says 20k miles. I'm also told that new gaskets are available 
as of six months ago which are better. I have a 1985 Westphalia.
