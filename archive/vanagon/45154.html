 Subject: 1970 VW bus

  For sale: 1970 VW Bus
  Vehicle is in fair condition and was a daily driver until it was taken off
  the road in July 1993 (it is not running).  Good for restoration or repair
  to daily driver condition.  1600cc Type I engine, recent shocks, some
  camper equipment (ice box/sink, fold out bed, cabinets - these items were
  added by a previous owner - it is not a Westfalia camper).  Car is located
  in Eastern Suffolk County on Long Island (it has a transferable New York
  registration) and may be viewed on weekends with 3-4 days notice.
  $700 / new owner is responsible for the removing vehicle
  For more details or an appointment to view the vehicle, please call David
  _at_ 718-788-1729.  If I'm not home, please leave a message and I will return
  your call.
