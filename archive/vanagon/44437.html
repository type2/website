Subject: Re: Wasserboxer Engine Rebuild

I thought I saw a previous post you put on the list about being in Virginia.
 Is this were you're located?  I know of a few good shops for repairs
(especially machine) in the DC metro area.

I used a parts house called Olumpic Imported Parts when I rebuilt my 85
wasserboxer last year.  They couldn't get everything I needed but I'd say
they were able to order about 95% of the parts I required.  The prices were
great.  If they gave me a price that was higher than a competitor, they would
drop the price for me.  (I paid $150 for two head gasket rebuild kits)  I
never found the rebuild kits for less than $135 EACH in my area.  They were
the same brand that other parts shops had quoted me on.
