Subject: Re: Bench Seat, Reasons, Child Seats, other things.

Regarding the rear facing jump seats, one thing to consider, they 
have a bit of a rep for making people carsick if you are so inclined 
which I am not, but a previous SO was.   I had an '87 as a loaner 
briefly and she could not ride in them, I later was talking to the 
dealer who was loaning me the car and he said he had noted the same 
thing with one of his kids.  I think it is the fact you are staring 
out that big rear window or something, who knows.
