Subject: the parts place.

dear bus-people,
    it seems i'm the only one who doesn't know what this PARTS PLACE is. do
they have parts for the bus ? i'm so annoyed with the local veedub dealers
(they're the most unfriendly, least knowledgable and by far priciest bunch
i've ever seen...), i figure ANY other source must be better, in spite of
some of the problems some listmembers apparently encountered. so is this
where you folks get your parts when you work on the bus ? or are there other
secret sources ? if anyone has an address or phone # of the PARTS PLACE or
any other source like that, let me know ??
    schoenen dank auch,
gregor \ 73 westy &quot;FESTUS&quot;
