Subject: *** VW bus'77: engine trouble ***

Hi all

this is a resend of a message a while back, I'm afraid I've been off-line
so I didn't catch the answers :(

I have a 1977 2ltr vw van. Recently the fan detached itself, shearing the 
three bolts that hold it to the crank shaft. The middle bolt was also loose.

On investigating the extent of the damage the following two facts have been
found:
1) van in gear:     when turning the ignition key the van lurches forward as 
                    you would expect.
2) van not in gear: when turning the ignition key the starter motor sounds 
                    as if it is not engaging. Looking at the crankshaft 
                    when turning the key reveals that it is not spinning.

An assumption for this could be that when it is in gear, the clutch has 
pushed the flywheel into position so the starter motor engages. When it is
not in gear the flywheel is not in position, ie something has broken!

Any ideas as to how to continue? Is there anyway of telling what might be
wrong before I drop the engine or is it simply best to drop the engine and
take a look?

Many thanks,
Ian
