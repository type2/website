I took a look at Camping World. The best option there is a small propane
Catalytic Heater for $200.

Where are you getting the &quot;Propex&quot; heater? Isn't that an unvented heater?

&gt;Currently we let the engine run all night. This uses 1/4 tank of gas and
&gt;seems to really do some engine damage.
&gt;
&gt;Are there any accessories available for heating the interior using the
&gt;alternate 12V battery, LPG or unleaded-gas. At this point I am about to
&gt;start searching for an external AC generator.

Ron,

What a can of worms!  This is a question that really should be addressed by
the FAQ, and I'll work on it sometime soon.

In the meantime, you might want to ask this question on the Vanagon Mailing
List.  (You'll find information in the 'Links' section of the FAQ.)  There
are more answers than I can go into here.

One solution that I'm taking is a tiny little propane heater called the
&quot;Propex&quot; heater.  It's about 8&quot; x 14&quot; x 4&quot;, and fits under the bench seat.
Unfortunately it's about $500.  There are other heaters (available through
RV outlets such as Camping World) that go for less, are larger, and throw
more heat.

Most people seem to feel that unvented heaters are too dangerous, so I'd
avoid those.
