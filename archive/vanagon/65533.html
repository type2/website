Subject:      O2 sensor, Help Needed

Howdy,
My O2 sensor on my 87'Wolfburg seems &quot;stuck&quot;  I tried removing it with my
O2 sensor socket and a 3/8rachet but the darn thing won't bulge at all!
Anyone has any killer ideas?  Taking off the cat will be a real pain, I
hope isn't the only way.

Anyone wanna take a crack at this?

Thanks
Jack
