Subject: Re: Go with the split

	I tend to agree with Bob's conclusions but not this time-
The best wrench I know (my brother) drives and services a waterboxer
Vanagon
	It is easier to find airheads :) who are experienced and 
enthusiastic mechanics than waterheads. Price of entry for the T3 
enthusiast is significantly higher than T2 or T1, and aftermarket 
support it thinner. Mistakes cost more and are less likely to be 
risked.
	On the other hand, welding isn't on the summer maintenance 
list of the average T3. They're 10-25 YEARS younger than the loaves
and splits. They still have original paint and interiors. They
still have significant resale value to non-enthusiasts. They don't
need replacement fiddly bits for the brake system.

	HEY JOEL! Keep the Weakly Stats combined, and note how many 
and what they drive are either separated list, or both? What do you say?

	Granted, the waterboxer is not a paragon of mechanical virtue, 
lasting only 30%-100% longer than a typical aircooled motor while making 
only  25%-50% MORE power. Oh, the defect? Waterboxers are expensive to own 
and maintain, and truely are orphaned. (though isn't the T3 still made 
in South Africa, with inline motors?) But if I can't find or can't afford
an EV/T4 next year, I'll probably buy a waterboxer T3 for those whom
are dearest to me.

	VWoA HAS orphaned the EV, in the USA, but the rest of the world
has 'em and I know, from personal experience, that water cooled inline
motors aren't significantly harder to work on than flat aircooled. I'll 
put up the inline 1600, with K-Jet or later, what the Mexicans put in T2s, 
as VWs best motor of all time. Alas, but for DOT and the Big Nannies, I 
could have one.

	Go drive a 6.7l turbo diesel GMC pickup, or a Chrysler Voyager,
or a Chevy Astro van. Look under the hood. Look at how its screwed 
together. Talk to the owners. T1-4 still have more in common than not.
The only FWD watercooled van owners I know who do their own maintenance
drive, surprise, Eurovans. Personally, I think the watercooled community
will miss voices like Bob's, and will know that they miss them.
