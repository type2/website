Subject: synthetic update
Date: Tue, 23 May 95 21:29:58 EDT

Today, I changed the synthetic oil on the 82 Westfalia and here is what I
found.

The rocker covers and the rockers were very clean with virtually no sludge
of the kind that I am usually find in the KG. In fact everything looked
very clean. The biggest difference was the condition of the rocker cover
gaskets. They appeared to have shrunk slightly and appeared somewhat
&quot;drier&quot; than usual. This could account for the small leak on the left side.

The sump plate, the drain plug and the oil strainer all looked good. There
was slight build up of &quot;varnish around each of the gasket areas. Could
this be due to the sythetic settling in around the gaskets?

The condition of the oil (5W15) was lighter than usual after the six
months of sitting in the engine. Normally oil becomes dark after several
thousand miles.Not this stuff. I am now going to put in 15W50 for the
summer and also install a secondary oil cooler thermostat and oil temp
sender while  the oil and parts are
out. This should help keep the engine running through the summer. We plan
on driving down to Ohio if GNATT is passing through... we could hook up
with you.
