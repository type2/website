_at_That's pretty desolate country -- I haven't been north of I-40 along
_at_that stretch, but I've been to Amboy, which is south of I-40 between
_at_Ludlow and Twentynine Palms. Nice volcano!

_at_How about an AZ/NM bus trip to the Chiricahuas?

As the sole (posting) member of the New Mexico bus-dudes/dudettes, I 
ask:  where (&amp;what) are the Chiricahuas?
