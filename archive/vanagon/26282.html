 Bay Area Bus Bozos &amp; Bozettes,

 If Bob's return route to his home takes him through the Bay Area AND if he
 is feeling so inclined, perhaps this would be a good time to schedule
 another pizza and beer get-together, similar to what we did when Sami
 was in town.

 So, whaddya think?  Bob, can you be lured off of Interstate 5 for some
 some camaraderie, or maybe a valve adjustment and an oil change? 


 Dave
