Subject: VW Advertising

In the latest issue of &quot;Print&quot; (Print XLIX:I), there's a wonderful
retrospective on VW advertising, mostly featuring bugs and breadloaves.  The
examples range from a 1930s picture of Dr. Porche and Hitler admiring a bug,
to a 1972 picture of a full camper including tent and canary cage, to a 1986
Syncro ad.  There are 31 ads in all analyzed from a graphics design point of
view, over 10 pages.  Very nicely done.

In the Bay Area, I found my copy at Computer Literacy (of all places.)
