Subject: Re: diesel alternator, same?

VW only used a few different alternators for their diesels. The minor
differences are the amperage, higher amperage alternators for the cars with
AC and all the other stuff. Which also necessitated the bracket changes.
Look at the mounts on your alternator. Most of them have the pivot at 6
O'clock and the adjusting ear at 12 O'clock. Any VW alternator with the
same mounting configurations will work. HTH

&gt;Another problem for me! Yea! :(  simple question: is the alternator in 
&gt;my diesel the same as the gas models? If not, is it the same as a diesel

&gt;probably could get a used one under $50 (I hope).
