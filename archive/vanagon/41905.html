Subject: Re[2]: Bus Boys comes thru Pt 2

     and Jim did tell us the whole story...
     
     &gt;I did forget to mention that we do have 2 other people that work in 
     &gt;our Manufacturing Shop, but don't go anywhere near the phones 'cause 
     &gt;they're workin' their butts off 6 days a week building beams, swing 
     
     [snip]
     
     &gt;Keep on flamin' :)  Jim / BusBoys_at_aol_dot_com
     
     hoorah for Bus Boys, I wear their sticker on my Samba :)
     
     If i'm ever in Redding, or even in the USA, I'll be popping in to see 
     the boys.
