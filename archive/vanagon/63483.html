Subject: Drive-in Night - Saturday August 9


Wouldn't you know it....just after I have Joel get me a list of Vanagon 
members in the MA/RI/CT area so I could send them e-mail about drive-in 
night...Gerry gets the old list up...but who's complaining!! I've been 
suffering from serious list withdrawal myself....  ;-)


Here's the info:

LiMBO/VANAGON/TYPE2 night at the drive-in movies
Saturday, August 9
Rustic Drive-in, Rt 146 Smithfield, RI
1 mile north of the intersection of I295 and Rt. 146 (easily accessable from 
RI, MA and CT via I95).
Three screens show three different double features (They'll have the weekend 
line-up on thursday....and I'll try to post)

Try to arrive between 7 and 7:30....bring lawn chairs...blankets, etc....oh, 
yeah...family, friends...and your vans!


Ric
