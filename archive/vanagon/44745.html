&gt;The air conditioning fan/thermostat switch (VWA part # 175 272 327, cost
&gt;$42.00) on my 86 Westfalia last about 14 months before it fails due to
&gt;overheating of the switch internal components resulting in loose terminals
&gt;and charred insulator material around the &quot;B&quot; terminal of the switch.  The
&gt;ac fan works ok and the correct fuse is in place.  This is a different
&gt;switch from the non-Westi air conditioning unit.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone experienced this?
&gt;
&gt;

No. But it sounds like you have way tyoo much current going through that
switch somehow.  I'd get out the wiring diagram and start checking all of the
components &amp; wiring &quot;downline&quot; from that switch for partial shorts which
could increase the current but still not pull enough current to blow the
fuse.

Good luck,
