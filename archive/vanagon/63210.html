I talked to Kennedy last week.  They do no have any internet access at
this point in time.

&gt; Does any one know if Kennedy Engineering has a home page or e-mail
&gt; address?
&gt;
&gt;   If one of the articulate list member would compose a breif, concise
&gt; letter expressing our needs and concerns, it could easily be cut and
&gt; pasted into letter form.  Then both an electronic and hard copy could be
&gt; sent with little effort by the list members. The effort would consist of
&gt; an investment of twenty minutes of time and the cost of an evelope and
&gt; stamp.
&gt;
&gt; It would be interesting to see a their reaction when they receive 300 or
&gt; more letters.   The shock value alone would be unmeasurable.
&gt; At this point the response to the mailing has been insufficient proceed
&gt; with the action. If anyone else is interested please drop me a note.
&gt;
&gt; Some people may feel this activity falls into the SPAM catagory. But I
&gt; feel this is a legitamate interested expressed by several list members.
&gt; This seems like a good opportunity to utilize the powers of supply and
&gt; demand to create a situation that can benefit both Vanagon owners and
&gt; Kennedy Engineering. The latter being for them to decide.
