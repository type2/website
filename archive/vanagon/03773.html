Mine does the same but only  in cold weather (for CA that's below
60 degrees).

&gt; For some time now the clutch pedal in my '79 Bus
&gt; creaks, groans, and feels (especially if you're
&gt; taking off in first) like there are little notches
&gt; catching it.  The clutch itself seems to be in
&gt; good adjustment, but I did it again anyway.  Also
&gt; soaked the pedal assembly with WD-40 (helped for a
&gt; while) penetrating oil (ditto) then cleaned it &amp; lubed
&gt; it all up again.  Now it's creaking and &quot;notching&quot;
&gt; again.  Advice from ace mechanics, cheerful crackpots
&gt; and all others earnestly sought.  BTW, the clutch is
&gt; fairly new (30K) and I take good care of it...
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.
