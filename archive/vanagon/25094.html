Subject: RE: Need Numbers



&gt;I promised a lady here at the office I'd bring in some catalogs - she has
&gt;a '67 and '66 camper - and I forgot.  I wanna placate her with numbers
&gt;for RMMW and Wolfsburg West so she won't Lorena me or anything...
&gt;
&gt;Can anyone help out?


RMMW: 1-800-544-1066
WW: 1-714-630-9653

and if those aren't enough,

Police Emergency:  911  (Rapid Reaction)
Mercy Hospital: 1-619-260-7000  (Surgical Reattachments)

Good luck, and don't sleep in an unlocked room, bro... good, if unexpected,
reason to own your own camper.
