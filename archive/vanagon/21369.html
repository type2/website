Frankly folks, I think we're missing the boat on this one.  Since the Wall
came crashing down we've been trying to establish contact with Russian
veedubers, wondering if those rumors of cast iron Rumania 36hp engines were
true, or the one about a whole field of Wehrmarct swimmer-wagens moldering at
an armory near Trabdva.  

Here's are big chance!  We all know the best Russian mechanics are women.
 All we gotta do is find one that can provide information about Russian
air-cooled veedubs then elect one of our subscribers to woe the secrets out
of her, a neat reversal of the old Honey Trap.

And what about a Russian Tour?  Hell, it's only a couple of miles between
Little Diomide and Big Diomide; we'll caravan to Alaska, hire a car ferry to
plop us down on the other shore and drive down to Moscow for the weekend.
 (Martha?  Think 'magnesium'.)  Buses under the Arch is fine.  But howzabout
Buses in Red Square?

Come on, guys!  (And you gals, too.)  We owe it to our bugs and buses.  (I
nominate Joel.  Russian gals love a poet.)
