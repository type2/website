Hello,

I have been rebuilding many problem areas on my '71 Westy and have run 
into a problem I cant seem to figure out.  I have a servo/vaccuum assist 
master cylinder after filling and bleeding the system I decided to take 
it out.  Well when I use the brake it lugs down the engine and will 
quickly kill it.  Is there something anyone can tell me 
as to why it does this?

Thanks,

Stephen Schmidt
