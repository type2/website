Subject: '79 Camper Bus Main Drive Bearing Prob, etc..

I've got a '79 VW Camper Bus that I bought very recently.  Upon taking
it to a mechanic I am dismayed to learn that that noisy whine the
transmission makes is in fact the sound of a main drive bearing gone
bad.  

How bad is this?  I mean it still shifts and doesn't slip out of
gear...  It's noisy, but does this mean I shouldn't go on long trips
until I get it fixed?

Speaking of fixed, they estimated it would cost $65 for parts and $280
for labor.  Ouch.  That seems like enough to buy a whole new
transmission!

Any insights would be greatly appreciated...

Oh, I almost forgot... The reason I took it to a mechanic was because
it wouldn't pass DEQ because the idle is to high.  But the idle
adjustment screw is apparently bottomed out.  Is there another way to
slow the idle down?

Also, the mechanic said that the gear shifter was WAY too sloppy and
that chances are the gear selector plate is broken as well as shifter
bushings being bad.  He said I should go for an after-market shifter
that isn't VW but supposedly works better than trying to find the
right VW parts.  Does that sound reasonable?  The kit to replace the
shifter costs $120.

Thanks,

Pete
