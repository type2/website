Subject: Update: Why's One Side Hotter?

Looks like the mystery has been solved.

Had to pull the engine to get the generator out, so I decided to retorque 
my heads, fix some exhaust leaks, and generally look over the situation. 
(I know I could have pulled the generator without pulling the engine; I 
even tried, but I finally decided it was more trouble than it was 
worth...and I had these other problems...and I have the week off but 
can't go anywhere since my wife's working...etc.--lots of good excuses 
for pulling the engine.) 8)

While investigating, I discovered that one of the valves had slid out of 
the spring retainer a little and the oil deflector ring (?) was floating 
back and forth on the valve. Pulled the head and took it back to the guy 
who originally did the work. He's going to fix it and I'll get it back 
tomorrow. I'm not sure, but I believe this problem may have been at the 
heart of one side being hotter than the other. This head was  the hot side.

Thanks! Joe
