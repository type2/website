&gt; 
&gt; . but I know that replacing the missing panels behind the grill on my 81
&gt; Vanagon made a big difference in how much air comes through the fresh air
&gt; system at highway speeds.  For those of you who haven't looked, the fresh
&gt; air intake only uses about 1/5 of the area of the grill.  The rest is supposed
&gt; to be blocked off by waterproof cardboard pieces that fall off and disappear
&gt; unless the spare tire catches them.


Could you clarify the &quot;big difference&quot; for me.  Does more or less air
come through the vents when the cardboard pieces are missing.  Mine
are gone and I've been thinking of replacing them, but not at the expense
of decreased air flow.
