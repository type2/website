Ok, 

	A tip of the barndoor derby to Pim van Loon for his contribution
of a pic of an interesting barndoor fire bus.  I also have pics of Tom
B's '53 Deluxe, thanks to David Schwarze.

	I've started the Microbus Resource Page (http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/resource.html) but I haven't added anything yet.  Perhaps if you'd like to
help... (hint hint)

Thom
