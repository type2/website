&lt;&lt; Any response appreciated.  On the road and my 90 Carat engine temp
 warning light started to flash rapidly.  Gauge needle reads just above
 half or 3/4- normal for this car for the last 50000 miles.

 Which can I believe, or is there a reason for the condition that might
 be known?  It has never done this before.

 Thanks in advance, &gt;&gt;

Keep in mind the following two things whilst diagnosing this problem.
1. The light is to indicate a low coolant level.  The coolant level sensor is
located in the cap of the plastic coolant tank at the left/rear of the engine
compartment. This is NOT the tank you can see through the license plate hole.

2. The circuit that activates this light &quot;latches&quot; the light on whenever the
coolant level drops - even for an instant.  To reset the light circuit you
must turn the van off &amp; then back on again, otherwise the light will stay
activated &quot;forever&quot;.

Good luck,
