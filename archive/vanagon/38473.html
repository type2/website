Subject: Advice needed on '74 Custom Safare


Hello folks,

I think I may be on the verge of fulfilling a 10 yr. dream - 
getting a VW camper.  But first, I figured I'd better bounce
some things off the friendly people on this list.

Here's what I know about the bus so far:

1974 Custom Safare (non-poptop camper)

Current owner (3rd) reports:

- Originally a California vehicle, moved to Ohio, then to NY
- Current engine has 32K miles on it
- &quot;compression is excellent - all cylinders between 140 &amp; 150&quot;
- Minor rust around windows, repaired
- Undercoating in good shape
- Mechanically sound
- 90% to 95% restored, according to him
- Has been ordered by parental unit to sell some vehicles or move out

Asking price is $2,000, includes spare doors and motor.

Now, details on me, the potential buyer:

- Will be 1st time bus owner, 3rd time VW owner
- Zero experience on air-cooled engines, but generally fearless
- Looking to use this vehicle primarily for weekend getaways
- Unencumbered by potential spousal evil eye
- Clearly have a few screws loose

So, whaddya y'all think?  Could this be the bus for me?  Is this
a fair price for this bus?  Everything else I've looked at in this
area (metro NY/NJ) is priced in the $5K and up category.  

I would appreciate any comments, especially on specifics to look 
for when I go check it out on Saturday.  Responses via this list 
or private e-mail are all greatly appreciated.  I'll post the 
outcome of my visit if anyone is interested.

Thanks in advance,

John Breitenbach
