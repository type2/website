Subject: Re: hydraulic valve lifters?

This is what I believe about hydraulic lifters.

They provide some cushioning effect to reduce impact and wear on rockers, lifters
and valve tips. Tappet clearance is totally eliminated. The hydraulic lifter also
self adjusts. The engine will run quieter and the valve train will last longer.
It eliminates the need of valve adjustment. Valve opening and closing is more
accurate. Engine performance is always at the best.

It works like a pump. when it is fully pumped up it will work almost like a solid
lifter. It will firmly press against the valve tip but not firm enough to push
the valve off its seat, which would cause the valve to overheat and warp.

However, if the car has been sitting around for too long (sometimes could be just
a few days or even in one day) the lifetr might collapse. When the engine is
stationary half of the valves are compressed and partially opened. This causes
the compressed oil inside the lifter to leak out. Cars with a lot of miles tend
to have worn lifters and will leak faster.

This is not a problem though. Once the engine is started oil will be pumped
back into the lifter again. It might take up to 30 minutes to fully recharge
all lifters. Do not drive the car if lifters are still clicking loud. the noise
will go away eventually. Replace dirty engine oil with fresh one if it takes a
long time to recharge the lifters. Once the noice is gone take a 5 minute driv
to fully recharge the lifters.

Lifters can go bad if they do wear out and can no longer withhold preasure.
This seldom happens really. Kepp enging oil clean is the key to keep them alive.
