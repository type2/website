 Can this be done? My Chevy (no flames please) truck needs a new transmission
 so I would like to use my '82 Vanagon as a tow vehicle to retrieve a split
 window van that I purchased. It about a 1000 mile trip, and I do not want to
 do anything too foolish.
 Thanks,
 Josh &gt;&gt;

I would not tow anything with an aircooled Vanagon.  Engine meltdown for
sure.
