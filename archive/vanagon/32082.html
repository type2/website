Subject: Early side view mirror

I need a little help finding a side view mirror for my old bus.  The one I am
trying to match has two rods between the mirror and the hinge.  One curves at
a slow 90 degrees the other goes straight at 45 degrees.  I have a picture I
can E-mail if you can't tell what it is from my description.

Thanks,
Dan
