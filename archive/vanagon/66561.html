Subject:      interesting book

I picked up a book which looks to be like a &quot;Muir&quot; for Volvo's.
The reason I'm mentioning it is that it has lots of general auto
maintenance and mechanical systems theory which appear to be applicable to
any car.
First chapter talks about rust, there are chapters on the different
mechanical systems, as well as a checklist for medium-term and long-term
storage.

Title is &quot;The Gothenburg Bible&quot;, it's on sale at IPD this month for $24.
It's basically a &quot;home press&quot; book that was clearly typeset on a Mac - it
uses Chicago font on the copyright page - the author was head of some Volvo
Club in Canada.
(IPD is a Volvo/Saab parts place: http:/www.ipd-usa_dot_com/ for info.)

(as you may guess, my other car is a Volvo, a 1984 with a little over 90K
miles.)
