Subject: RE: Hot Starting Solution

Might have been mentioned before: the large cable supplying juice to the
starter/solenoid gets green easily. Stripping back a bit of the insulation
sometimes reveals this. VW put in a new starter on our beauty, but the
intermittent hot start problem remained, until the cable actually fell off
the starter! (How they missed the corrosion is....). I cut 4&quot; from the
cable, crimped a 2-bit spade to the cable, and all is well, for now.
