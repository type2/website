Subject: Re: VW Vanagon Official Factory Repair Manual

&gt;  If someone has a used copy 
&gt;they'd like to sell, I'm an interested party. 

I have a used Vanagon Bentley manual I would sell for $40 (half of 
the new price) plus UPS.  However, it is an '84 edition, so it does 
not cover the 2.1 liter wasserboxer. It does cover the 1.9 liter 
water cooled motor, plus air cooled and diesel.
