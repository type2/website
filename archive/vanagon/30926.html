Subject: pressure testing cooling system

Is it worthwhile to own a tool for pressure testing wasserboxer cooling 
systems? I came across one today for $89 + $30 for VW/Audi adapter. Seems 
like it could be useful in the long run, but it's quite a bit of $ for such 
a special purpose thing. Anyone on the list have one of these?
