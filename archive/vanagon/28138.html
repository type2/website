&gt; my behind the seat plate reads:

&gt; November 4, 1961   production date
&gt; modifications  377 , 101, and 130 (hinged windshields)

I have the Mcode list from the latest NEATO newsletter, and 377
isn't on it.  101 is &quot;Snow tires, only with bus with M100&quot; (which is &quot;without
VW emblem&quot;)  Can you verify if this could be right?  130 is &quot;Type 24
without sunroof and roof windows&quot;  Sounds like a microbus with
deluxe trim--does yours have corner windows?

&gt; to   Mark  w/'62 Kombi,  what is the divided cab partition?  Is that the same
&gt; as walk though front seats instead of a bench seat?

That makes sense.  My bus is a walkthrough.  I thought it might be
a divider like in a panel van, but your explanation is more likely.
&gt; 
&gt; does anyone have a list of modification codes handy?
&gt; 

The NEATO list had a lot, but not all.  Anyone know how they
got the ones they did and if there are more?  I'd be willing
to coordinate Mcode listing efforts and put them on a web
page.
