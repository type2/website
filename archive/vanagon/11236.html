Subject: Re: westy auxillary battery

along a similar vein:

i would also like to put an additional 12 volt deep cycle battery in my
buses (65' and 73' both 12 volt) so that i can run my accessories without
killing my startup battery. Has anybody performed this (what i hope is)
reasonably staightforward operation. If so i would like to hear about it
too.

BTW Thom, can't think of too many people stocking 6 volt deep cycle
batteries. Most deep cycle batteries that i know of are for RV
applications, which to my limited knowledge are all 12 volt.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Has anyone else done this?  Should you use a deep discharge marine type
&gt;&gt;&gt;battery for the aux.?  Also, is there a way to figure the amount of time the
&gt;&gt;&gt;power will last before aux. battery drains?  Is it worth it, or will lights
&gt;&gt;&gt;and radio drain the battery in an hour or so anyway?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I set up twin batteries in the notcback I used to have, to power a
&gt;&gt;monster stereo.  Worked great!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I am thinking about doing something like this in my 56, but with a twist.
&gt;&gt;The bus is 6V, and I wanna run a 12V deep cycle for the fridge and
&gt;&gt;any other stuff I decide to put in.  What would I have to do to get the
&gt;&gt;6V to charge the deep cycle?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Thom-
&gt; I guess you don't like the two 6volt batteries in series.
&gt;about the 1 12voly deep cycle-
&gt;
&gt; You need a voltage doubler circuit (not cheap) or a DC to DC converter(not
&gt;cheap either.)  Or maybe two generators!  You could use two 6-volt or one of
&gt;each- 6 and 12.  I don't think you'll like either of these.  can you get
&gt;deep cycle 6 volt batteries?
