I want a knove.

I've got every tool known to modern man and a few that haven't been invented
yet but kno knoves.  (I'd like a shiny one, please.)

Indeed, if knoves are specifically required for Vanagon blower switch repairs
we should ALL have a knove in our tool kit, even if they cost three bucks or
more and were heretofore only available in the State of Main.
