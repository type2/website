Subject: Engine rebuild - heads

Is the cylinder head work offered by the shop guaranteed?  What experience
do they have with VW head work?  I have an older VW van, that uses a Bug
motor, and when I need a new cylinder head, I just buy a rebuilt one, and
trade in the old head as a core.  For 250 bucks, those heads might not be
such a bad investment.  But consider who is providing them.  Are they VW
specialists?  Do they guarantee their product? 

Shop around.  And ask many, many questions.

Wolf
