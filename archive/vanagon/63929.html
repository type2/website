Subject: Re: vanagon chat??

This isn't about vanagon chat, however if anyone knows anyone who has an air
flow meter for a 81 vanagon 2.0 L air-cooled, that is new or still factory
sealed, please E-mail me. PLEASE ! I am beginning to get upset with my
vanagon just sitting there in the driveway. I have got an estimate for over
$300.00 that seems a little steep.
