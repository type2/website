&gt;        Anybody else notice that everytime Steve posts about his V6anagon
&gt;he goes up hills just a little faster? Last post said 65 in 4th, now it's
&gt;70. Hmm, methinks the man is bragging...    ;-)

yeah. ever notice he NEVER says anything about going DOWNhill??? say ...
maybe he CAN'T go downhill!!! maybe that thing has like an old Saab
transmission with a free-wheeling overdrive (or as we say in the south,
a Georgia-Overdrive &lt;kick it into Neutral, so the motor don't overrev.
of course, the brakes melt and catch fire, but ... &gt;).
