Subject: Re(2): Rough running when Hot

Hi Larry,

What would be the method of determining if the O2 sensor is bad or not.  I have
heard that the engine will not run with a bad O2 sensor.  Like in the case when
the exhaust pipe leading to the cat. converter developes a hole, and the engine
will not run, since the O2 sensor becomes confused about the O2 level.  

Thanks,

Charles
