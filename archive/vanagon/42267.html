Subject: 1967 makes it to Ohio (long)

Hi all,
	Last weekend I took a trip to PA near Philly to pick up a 1967 
deluxe. Spent 8 hours getting there on Friday night and camped. Saturday 
morning went to look at the van and everything seemed to be in order but 
we had to replace (the seller and I) the generator belt. The belt belt on 
there was too big. The seller had bokught another belt, but it turned out 
to be the same size. When I finally did find a belt that fit, we put it 
on and the engine ate it right up. Huh? Well I looked at the belt and it 
was slightly wider than the original so I went back to the FLAPS to find 
a thinner belt. After 2 tries finally found it at the NAPA store. Got 
back and tried to put it on, it didn't seem as if it was going to work 
but then we realized we were putting the pulley half on backwards. (cool)
	Well after that it  was time to put this thing on the road. Took 
a little getting used to to drive, the steering was a bit sloppy but all 
in all not to bad. Every thing was great until the rain hit and it turned 
to 40 degrees out. The van kept going though, leaking, wiper-less, and 
cold. I was praying to every VW deity that this bus make it back to Ohio 
and it did. No problems except for running out of gas. (duh) Which 
happened to be right in front of an officer who had someone else pulled 
over. (the bus had expired (in '90) texas plates on it) Luckily enough I 
beat the officer to my bus and drove it away. The whole trip took close to 
12 hours. I was just very glad to get home, the next day the bus wouldn't 
start, but I figured it was just tired. Now I can't wait for this summer 
when my time not spent working will be fixing this van up.
