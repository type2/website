Subject:      Re: Sagging on one side - Westys

Okay gang. Tell me to what degree of craziness this idea is:

I have a liberal Westy (It leans to the left). (1988, 104K miles) It is
noticeable when the van is empty, more so when the water tank is full.  My
thinking is that the left springs have sagged a bit because of the extra
weight.

So, what would happen if I got a spring compressor and swapped the springs
left to right? The weaker left springs would go on the right. Would this
have the result of leveling out the Van?

Or is this an exercise in futility?
