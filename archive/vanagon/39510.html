Subject:       Things to see on Oregon Coast

I'm about 8-10 issues behind in reading the digests, I've been so 
busy getting the 88 Westy ready for our 2 week trek down the 
Oregon/Wa coast.

We've picked up some touristy stuff, but can anyone suggest some 
highlights between Port Angeles, Wa &amp; San Francisco (along the coast)?

We're most interested in 'off the beaten path' type stuff, away from 
the 40' rigs with gensets &amp; TVs....

Pls e-mail direct, we're leaving this Saturday. :))) 

Thx.

ps:

Our '88 Westy survived two nights of heavy rains at Buttle Lake last 
w/e! Only a few drips from the canvas where it had been patched. The 
highway do not fare so well - it was washed out in two places. Had to 
take a detour on logging roads to get home, which the bus also 
handled wonderfully :)

Shawn.
