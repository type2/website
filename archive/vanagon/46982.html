Well, I'm back from my trip, almost 8,000 miles in three weeks, San
Francisco to Mass. and back. First off I'd like to say that Petey (the
wonderbus) performed absolutely flawlessly, not a flat tire, never refused
to start, used only 2 quarts of oil in those miles, 1 oil change, and
coming back that included towing a 900lb U-Haul trailer with 600lbs of
stuff loaded in it.

        Heading out took about 6 days, running around 65-70 mph, oil temps
stayed between 180-220. MPG was pretty dismal at around 17. The return trip
saw slightly higher temps, around 200-240, this was with running the
secondary oil cooler with the 10&quot; fan installed in the engine compartment.
Coming through the Mohave desert was the worst part of the trip with the
temps outside running close to 120. This was pushing the engine temps up to
250 and higher, so I stopped alot through that stretch.

        At a rest stop in the Mohave a young hippie couple had their 70
Westy parked, engine out and stripped down. It seems that it had melted the
previous night after about 4 hours of driving. They had a friend coming
from Phoenix with a longblock to put all their stuff on. Definitely a
character building experience!

        I am now a firm believer in secondary oil coolers. I think I have
to do a little more work on location and venting, and I'm sure I'll get
more info from Bob on that. But having the oil temp gauge is a major
necessity as far as I'm concerned. A pressure gauge is next on my list.

        Petey handled fine for most of the trip, but through the windy
states, Nebraska etc...it was pretty white knuckle. I replaced the front
two tires today and will go back this week to get a good alignment done.
The exhaust system needs some tightening up with new gaskets and nuts and
bolts, but aside from those things the VW needed nothing, great feeling.

After living in it for so long I've definitely learned what changes I want
to make to it, as far as the camper aspects go, and I'll write another
letter on that next.

Anyways, getting tired, I'll continue this Friday if anyone is interested
in alittle more info about the trip and how putting 8K miles on in 3 weeks
was.  Good to be back...
