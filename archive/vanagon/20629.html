=========================================================
I have a spare camper top that is free to who ever
comes and gets it this week. It is literally the whole
top off a mid seventies bus. It is good condition
and deserves to be on your bus rather than a landfill.
I am moving and it has to go.  Give me a call.
The top is located in Kennewick WA, southeast corner
of the state.  It is a rear popup with the luggage
stowage shelf over the drivers area.
