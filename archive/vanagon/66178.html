Subject:      Westfalia 1991 or 1986

I am planninng to buy a Westfalia but I hesitate between a 1991
Westfalia at 18 500,00$ Cdn (156K Km/ good condition)  and a 1986
Westfalia at 16 000,00$ Cdn (107K Km/ showroom condition/ come with
braw, Repair Guide/ alarm system).I like both although the 1986 is
automatic transmission and has only one table. What would you suggest
me to buy? Will the 1986 be much more difficult to resell at good
price in 5 years for instance ?

I have noticed that the 1991 Westfalia comes with two tables.but not
the 1986. Was this second table optional or could a table be added
easily in the older model ?

Do the driver seat swivel 180% on all Westfalia Models ? The 1986 that
I am planning to buy has a driver seat that swivel only at 90%. Is it
normal ?
