Subject: Re: EV w/VR6

&gt; minivans for 1996. Of the six powertrain  models available, only the
&gt; Caravelle VR6 will be sold in the U.S.
            ^^^
  I want the TDI! Is VWoA's head buried you know where?

&gt; Upgrades on the VR6 include a styling change - a longer front for a more
&gt; passenger-car-like look - that differentiates it from the Transporter
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  Double triple YUCK!!!!!!!

I thought they were suppose to improve it?

Sorry, I just couldn't resist complaining.
