Subject:       Black Hills 1st 2 weeks in June

I and my family will be in the Black Hills in the begining of June.  
If anyone else is out there and sees a TITAN RED Westy with a 
schmucked driver's side it be me.  Oh, yeah, vanagon.lenti placard in 
back window!  Wave me down or stop by if you see us parked.  No 
schedule-- liable to be anywhere in the Hill's (love that kind of 
vacation).  Join us for a cold one.

thanx to all those who offered kind words to me (or was it to my 
van?) after the accident... insurance is still panning out, other 
party claims my wife crossed the road and hit THEM, y'all been there, 
right?  vacation still goes on tho!
