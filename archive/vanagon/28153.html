&gt;      All in all, it was a beautiful fall day. I'm high on the
&gt;      off-road learning curve, and picked up a lot.  Dereks rule
&gt;      prevails. Ready and willing to get stuck, the Syncro Westies
&gt;      went places and did things I never would have considered before.
&gt;      We all had a great time.

Funny if VW would have ever done such things and taken some
photo's for add campaigns maybe they could have sold thousands
of Syncros every month in the US.  Great story, great vehicles,
typically poor VWoA.  Were there ever Vanagon Syncro Commercials?
I barely even remember Vanagon commercials period.  I guess
they were to busy thinking up  FARDKJVOIALWMEKLVERLDKLKFDNULDKLGEN
which has to be the most recognized add campaign ever ripped off
by everyone but of course never associated with VW.  Of course once
it got a littler popular they dropped it.  Drivers Wanted on the
road of life now (especially ones that look like their dogs).  Oh
I'm in a bitter with VWoA mood today (if you haven't guessed) I
won't elaborate though.  Still great story, but leaves me wondering
just what could Tom do with that 200 Quattro and some higher tires?
Anybody ever see a Tresser 4000 Quattro conversion with the skid
plates, bumper bars, raised suspension?  Nearly bought one outside
of DC a few years back after the Quantum Syncro left, price was right
but too many miles, kind of wish I had, real bitchin conversion  plus
then I would be fighting with it not the #)_at_!%(* G60.
