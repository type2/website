Subject: Re: first drive with all the gauges(temps on 70 westie)

I bought a three gauge plate with the tachometer in the middle.
I mounted it under the dash just to the right of the steering column. It is
fine but if I am not careful I skin my knuckes going into first gear. I
mounted my ammeter and voltmeter just to the left of the steering column.
I found the wire that is turned on by the ignition and the wire to the
instrument panel lights that gets dimmed by turning the light knob.

The connections for the instruments from the engine compartment are easy but
dirty.
Do not forget that the tachometer and the oil temp need a wire from the
ignition.
