Subject:      Re: Low idle speed when cold

&gt;I got my replacement part to confirm the price.  She couldn't remember
&gt;exactly, but they said thrity-something dollars.  So, I think I got
&gt;mine one time for cheap ...

hmmmm. and my wiring harness gizmo went from $38 to $95. i wonder if vw just
recently had a big vanagon parts price increase? :(

&gt;cold starting to keep the engine from stalling. My '84 seemed to
&gt;have a &quot;high idle&quot; which this '87 does not.

it's possible that
1. your idle speed was adjusted wrong ... cause the dealer didn't know that
   the coolant temp sensor was bad.  probably have to get the CO content
   checked to get it fixed (adjusted correctly).
2. that little idle valve thingie (the hose-looking gizmo that is supposed to
   buzz/vibrate/hummm when you crank up) isn't working right.
3. oxygen sensor gone bad? needing to heat up before it works right?

i'd bet on the idle speed adjustment being bad. you could screw with it       yo
you what i did (we don't have any emissions testing here ... but i did get
mine tested last time i was in atlanta, and it 'passed').
