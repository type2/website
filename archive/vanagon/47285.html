Subject: Re: Greed intervenes on behalf of the EV.....

Ric says:

&gt;During our talk, he mentioned someone stopping by with =
&gt;greenbacks in hand and offering $1k more than I did. So he said he'd =
&gt;keep our deal as long as I came up with cash in 48 hrs....

Boy, I'd stay in contact with this guy while I continued to try to 
move the EV- that sounds like a  typical &quot;hurry-up-the-sale&quot; line, not 
necessarily to be believed. If he really had an offer 10% higher, why 
wouldn't he take the best offer? Makes no sense to me.

Anyway, going through this exercise at least you know where your heart 
lies ;-)!  Syncro Westies forever!
