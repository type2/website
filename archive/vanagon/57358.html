Thanks for all the replies to the akwardness of the rear license 
plate door.  It wasn't just limited to the early Vanagons.  I figured 
they would have fixed it later on, as were some other little things. 
VW never bothered to correct, what I believe to be a problem.  
Just left us owners to fend for ourselves.  So simple to fix too.

Sounds like the springs get removed next time the opportunity 
presents itself.
