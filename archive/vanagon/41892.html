All,
	To add to what Angell wrote about avoiding fuel injected buses 
and shipping a bus down from the States to South American.  If you do not 
plan on driving your bus back into the States, the US government has 
rules on shipping vehicles back into the States.  For example, taking your 
own US registered bus off of a ship at a US port.  If it is 1968 or later it 
needs to be &quot;recertified&quot; for EPA equipment.  This is not cheap or fun!  
If your bus is pre'68 you can just unload it.  Of course, you can drive 
your bus back into the US from Mexico without any such problems.
