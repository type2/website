Subject: FS: complete AC unit 

I recently purchased a 1981 Vanagon that I'm in the process of rebuilding. I
 do not use AC and am wondering if there's any interest in the unit - ?-  I
have seen this same set-up in waterboxers and air cooled straight vanagon's
(not Westfalias). It basically  consists of two sections that span the
ceiling - the one with temperature and fan controls and vents mounts towards
the windshield, the other behind the front seats. It fits beautifully.Wtihout
having removed it yet it seems to consist of compressor and mounting bracket,
two large hoses that run underneath the van to the front, the two units
mentioned above (controls, evaporator, fan), drip tubes and receptacles,  and
a hose cover that mounts on the pillar behind the driver's seat.
