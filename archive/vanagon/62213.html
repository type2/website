Subject: Reimo Tents

     Called Reimo this morning and found out two things:
     
     1. It costs almost as much to ship a single tent to the US as it costs 
     for the tent.
     
     2. They are hopeful that they'll have a North American dealer sometime 
     this summer.
     
     Meanwhile, are there 10 or 20 of us who would like to &quot;share&quot; a bulk 
     shipment of tents?
