Well, with the '71 you have the fortune of cheap engine parts.  They 
basically use the same engine as the bug.  So you can get a rebuilt 
engine for $400-1000 depending on how good.... and you can always spend 
more.  :)  If you want only new pistons/cylinders and rebuilt heads, it's 
about $200.  You just need to decide what you want.  No need putting new 
parts on an engine that has bad bearings.
