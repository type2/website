Subject:      Re:  oh, my poor aching fingers ... Re-FIR-gerators

now, now, children! :)  were i to even think about taking money, especially
from such a poor and destitute group as Bus Drivers (lord knows, us Vanagon
Drivers need to keep ALL the pennies we can!) ... well, it would just RUIN
my amateur status!  and then i'd be a PRO-fess-shunal ... and i really hate
that word (cause it means someone who concerns him/herself with doing the
job ... and never asking IF the job should even be done).

anyway, i gratefully acknowledge and appreciate the accolades (such as they
are) from the lunatic fringe of the group. :)  it's a dirty job, but someone
has to do it.

of course, any time the rest of you lurkers wanna jump in, PLEASE DO!!! ;)

Unca Joel  (nyuk nyuk nyuk)

(did i ever tell you guys i look kinda like Curly ... but with glasses?)
