Subject: Re: '66 bus mirrors

hi

maybe to shed some light on the mirror issue:

VW of America made &quot;elephant ear&quot; mirrors for vehicles shipped to the
states. The small round mirrors appeared on some busses over here, and I
*believe* that they came standard on European busses. I *believe* that the
genuine VW elephant ears have VWOA stamped on the back of them. Anybody
know better than I?

p.s. i am waiting patiently lee griffiths ;)

&gt;     ray,
&gt;
&gt;     hmm, sounds like you've got big mirror problems.
&gt;
&gt;     Well my '64 came with two small rounded rectangular mirrors which are
&gt;     the same size at the top and bottom - they are the original ones. My
&gt;     mates (Danny) came with two little round ones. Since I got mine I
&gt;     fitted West-Coast-Metric 'Elephant ears', now I wasn't very happy with
&gt;     them coz the arms were painted black, and the screws which hold the
&gt;     mirror to the swivel clamp went rusty in a week! There's a place over
&gt;     here called KDF Enterprises that do a either genuine EE's or very goos
&gt;     fakes. I'll dig out there number - oops I think I was supposed to do
&gt;     this for someone else as well (Michael.Heron?).
&gt;
&gt;     Anyway because my door hinges were worn out I made new arms for my EE
&gt;     mirrors out of stainless steel - I also made them 1inch longer and
&gt;     bent them further out so I could see more, I then replaced the clamp
&gt;     screws with SS ones as well.
&gt;
&gt;     Lee.
&gt;
&gt;     ps, my SO parents are on holiday in Florida at this moment.
