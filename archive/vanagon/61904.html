&lt;&lt; I have had an 84 Vanagon for about two years now.  I have had two
different
 people tell me that a Porsche flat six will fit in the rear (one guy owned
 such a monister).   Does anyone know if this can be done?   I am not ready
 to do it at the moment, but if anything serious happened to my engine, this
 might be an option.   I'm sick of being passed by everyone and not passing
 anyone!    &gt;&gt;

check your local junkyard for a wrecked Boxter...

Shyeahhhh  riiite!!!!!   :&lt;)
