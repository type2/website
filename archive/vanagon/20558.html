&lt;&quot;Your decision to use a tomato stake is no doubt due to reading too much St.

Clearly  the tomato stake is &quot;plebeian&quot;, and   just as clearly   VW  (and
those of us with taste &amp; refinement) prefer the  &quot;structurally and
aesthetically&quot; more pleasing grape stake.
We must, however, give Mr. Muir the benefit of the doubt.  We've had 20
years of  refining influence (Mr .Bush, Mr. Reagan, Madonna, Sarajevo
etc.). Surely if mr. muir had had these, he would have recommended (if not
insisted on) grape stake.....

best regards,   moe
