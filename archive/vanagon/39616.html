Well, just like any other used vehicle, you need to consider the
general condition of the vehicle, the number of prior owners (the more
owners, the more likely I am to pass on the vehicle), the milage, the
mechanical condition (have a trusted mechanic check the vehicle for
you, preferably one who knows VW's) and last, but certainly not least
- your wallet (how much can you afford).

I have a 1985 Vanagon GL with 112K miles on it. I am the second owner
and bought mine about 6 years ago. It is still on it's first engine
(knock on wood) and hasn't given me much grief at all. It is finally
starting to reach the age to where my wife and I need to make a
decision about it - was I going to learn how to work on VW's (I am
already comfortable with American and British cars) or were we going
to sell it and buy a VW Eurovan. After pricing the Eurovans, we
decided that we can do lots and lots of work on the Vanagon and still
come out ahead (those puppies are expensive!).

As to what the different things after the Vanagon mean (i.e. GL,
Westfalia, Synchro, etc), they stand for the following:

The following was borrowed from a message that Joel Walker send me...

however, in the case of the Vanagon, it goes sorta like this:
- base model is the Transporter. a work truck.
- next up is the Standard. sort of a really cheaply furnished family
van (but with a little better interior and/or more features than the
work truck).
- next up is the L (Luxury?). even better quality interior than the
Standard and with more features.
- then the top of the line was the GL (Grand Luxury?): cloth seats,
chromed everything, air-conditioning, etc.
- and then later on, they started with the WLE (Wolfsburg Limited
Edition)
    to put even MORE features (and higher prices) to attract buyers.
- and even later, the Multivan and Carat and Weekender and so forth
were brought out.

and when the Eurovan came out, they did the same thing, but decided to
change all the letters!! now it's CL and MV. go figure.
