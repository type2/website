I just received my elbow connector for my 84 Westy from California Import
Parts.  I paid 76.00U.S. and the thing looks like it was made for the U.S.
Army.  I mean I could not believe the size and strength of this pipe.  The
dealer(VW) wanted 225 and Midas wanted 159.00.  I was very impressed with
California Import Parts.  Good Luck.
