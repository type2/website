martha rubin quotes:
&gt; 
&gt; I simply pour ~3/4 gallon of regular temp water into the sprayer's 
&gt; container, bring ~3/4 gallon of water to nearly a boil, pour it in, put the 
&gt; nozzle/pump unit on, shake er up, pump er up and let the shower begin.  
&gt; Works like a champ.  You'd be surprised at how satisfying this small amount 
&gt; of water can be.  I don't fill it up to the top because there has to be air 
&gt; in the container because it's compressed air that provides the pressure.  If 
&gt; there's no enough air, you have to pump too often to keep the pressure up.

How about going that one step better?  If the canister could be fitted with 
a schraeder valve, you could use one of those 12V portable air compressors
to maintain high pressure and a steady flow of water!  I think I really
like this idea...
