Yeah. I'm one of those that feels that dumping cold air on the head of your
kids in the back seats is NOT nice. I never open the back FRESH AIR vents in
the winter.  Also, pushing hot air up is cunterintuitive to me.  I leave the
windshield one closed halfway when I really want to heat the van -- I NEVER
get fogging -- even with no blower fan (case right now) The air will rise by
itself eventually -- you don't want to push it there do you?  The &quot;flow&quot; is
FRESH AIR.  NO HEAT in this air.  Do we really want to push cold air to the
back of the bus? 

Help me out here -- I'm lost.  Of course, my heater fan's shot anyway, so 
I shouldn't even be taking part in this discussion -- I also have air in 
the system.

Later.
