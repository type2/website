Subject: '83 Westfalia or not

Hello all!
          My parents are looking for newer Westfalia.  I've told them to go
either air-cooled Vanagon or post '86 because of the bigger engine and power
steering.  But more than anything they need one that is reliable.  I told
them that I thought that the air-cooled ones would be the most reliable
mainly because  I have heard of all the problems the waterboxers have had
with leaks and such.  Yesterday my Dad and I looked at an '83 waterboxer.  I
was nervous because this is the first year of water-cooled vans.  But this
Westfalia is the best looking Vanagon we have seen.  I looked under the van
and saw no sign of leaks (except oil but they all do that :).  The engine
seemed to have plenty of power and the automatic shifted fine.  This van has
70k and appears to have been garaged and well taken cared of and is
immaculate inside and out.  Should my parents risk trading their trusty, no
problems '89 Ford van in on this '83 Westfalia?
If they dedcide to keep looking (witch they might since it does not have one
of my mother's requirements, power steering) what do you think is the best
year for Vanagons as far as least amount of problems.

All opinions welcome!
