Just that, if a door is used you get a 1 meter or so, of free spaces on the indside wall??

Pleas give me your input on this one, has anyone had the same idea or a similar one.???

&gt;&gt; Well just that, instead of a slidingdoor a door will give you more 
&gt;&gt; space inside or what!
&gt;&gt; and why not use a door from a crewcab????
&gt; 
&gt;  It sounds like you better get friendly with a good welder...
&gt; just curious....Why do you want to get rid of your slider??
&gt; there's no space advantage to a &quot;swing out&quot; door/s. (which were never an
&gt; option, anyway..)
