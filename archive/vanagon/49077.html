&lt;&lt; a question: is phosphate-free antifreeze necessarily NOT green? When I
test
 drove my Vanagon several months ago, the coolant level indicator came on.
 The dealer promptly filled the expansion tank from a jug which was labeled
 'phosphate free' but was bright green in color. Isn't the ethylene glycol
 responsible for the green color (as opposed to the phosphate)?
 
 Someone please enlighten me. &gt;&gt;
  Actually the color is added in all antifrezzes.  usual standard color is
green.  Some phosphate formulas are the same blue that VW uses.  The new GM
&quot;DEX COOL&quot; and similar phosphate free long lifes are an off orange.  I
recently changed my camper over to the prestone long life.  Have been using
standard green prestone for 130K changing every two years.  Pulled hoses to
drain collant.  Stil no signs of anything there that does not belong.  No
white lumps or sludge deposits or anything I have seen in other vans.
