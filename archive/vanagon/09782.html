... Stuff deleted about Jordan Lake ...
&gt;    So, what think the people? How many of us are interested? When do we
&gt; want to do it? Speak now, or forever hold your peace...

Since Jordan Lake is practically in my back yard, I would have to vote
a big thumbs up.  I have never camped there, but I have been to the lake.
Nice facilites and lots of pine trees.
