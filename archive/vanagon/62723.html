Hi all

I was wondering if anyone knew of a substitute for vw tool (voltage tester
US 1115).
I am trying to troubleshoot my non starting 86 doublecab and the bentley
book uses this device to test the hall sender in the distributer. The
dreaded beast seems to have an unreliable spark?????
Unrelated ques. there is a wire that goes around the left side head, what
is it for?
Thanks in advance.
