Subject: BugJam/NEATO gathering in FLA

Spent the weekend cleaning the shop. Hired one of the local rug-rats to
come over and degrease parts and generally clean old bits up for the shows
in Tampa/Land-O-Lakes this coming weekend. This will be my first Bug-Show as
a &quot;vendor&quot; instead of a &quot;vendee&quot; and I'm scrambling to get bus stuff in some
sort of order. We will be there with three buses for sale, possibly more and
lots of used bus stuff.

A `66 21 window walk through deluxe....
   2k on new 1776, good radials, rebuilt Rhino Tranny and rebuilt front end.
   70% resto'd..mostly mechanical..needs paint and final bodywork.....4,500.00
A `67 Westfalia Camper
   Basic project bus. Interior is orig except for a later model sink/fridge
   needs finish bodywork, pop-top frame and canvas....................talk/obo
A `67 Panel Bus
   Not for the faint of heart. Actually in decent shape, but needs front pans
   and wheel well skirts. Has good tranny, dual master cyl, and bench seat with
   divider/spare wheel compartment..worthwhile project bus............talk/obo

The gathering for the NEATO folk is Saturday, Nov 11th from 8:00 am - 3:00 pm
the place is &quot;Reeves Volkswagen&quot; 11333 Florida Ave, Tampa, Fla.

The 95 BugJam is Sunday, Nov 12th from 7-ish till 4:30-ish and is held in
conjunction with the Land-O-lakes &quot;Flap-Jack Festival&quot; in L.O.L. Fla.
