&lt;&lt; Can anyone say of the VW system uses a resistor, or is this an old 
 fashioned method?  &gt;&gt;
The VW vanagon ignition system does not use a ballast resistor...which is
usually present for starting purposes.The coil can fail w/o having a ballast
resistor.Do not be confused w/ the resistor attached to the coil for radio
suppression.This will not affect the coil since it merely filters the ecess
ufarads to ground.
