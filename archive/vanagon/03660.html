Subject: rust, nuts, and bolts

Just tried to remove the old exhaust system from my 75 bus, but --as
usual-- got stuck on trivial and not very exciting problems, such as
unscrewing rusted bolts. I'm talking about the six bolts that hold the
exhaust system to the heater boxes, so 3 bolts on each side. I can't get a
grip on them: the 12mm wrench is too large and the 11mm wrench is too
small. Tried using a vice-grip but it slips off. 

I'll try to be more creative tomorrow, but if someone, somewhere, has a
good idea, please let me know.
