Subject: CV advice needed

Volks--
	I was driving around this weekend and noticed a small clack, clack,
clack when I made right-hand turns and applied power.  I may have
noticed it while going straight, but it was so slight that I'm not
sure.  I've never had a CV joint go bad, so I'm not familiar with what
that sounds like, but judging from what others on the list have said it
sounds to me like a bad CV joint.  Any other possibilities?  I have had
to replace the rear wheel bearings and this doesn't sound like that. 
Also, what are my alternatives?  Can I just repack them?  Or do I have
to replace them?  Has anyone priced these parts lately?  What might I
need?  Is there any way to better diagnose the problem?  I've never
claimed to be mechanically inclined, so is this something I should leave
to someone else?  I'd really like to take an 800 mile trip this coming
weekend, so i've got to act fast.  (and if I repack, will I make it on
the 800 miler?)

thanks,
Ian
