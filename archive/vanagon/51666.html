Subject: survey of insurance rates/companies

A while ago, we had some discussion of how to lower your insurance rates
by declaring your camper a mobile home.  But we didn't really get into
what companies had good rates, etc.  Well, its time for me to renew my
policy and I'm going to check around here for better rates, but I
thought I might check with the list at the same time to see what others
are paying.  Of course, I understand that rates will vary by locality &amp;
state, so this info might be anecdotal, but you never know, we might
find a company out there making good deals...

By the way, my camper is my daily driver and my ONLY vehicle.  Here's
the skinny on my ride:  I've got a 90 Vanagon Camper with 92k (all the
extras), am 31, good driving record, $100 &amp; $250 deductibles, the van is
not used for work, and I pay $495 per year thru Liberty Mutual.

can anyone beat that?
