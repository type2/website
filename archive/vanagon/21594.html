&gt;J. C. Whitney has an oil temp gauge for about $25 (gauge + sender).  I'll 
get
&gt;one, see how accurate it is, post the results.

I just got one of those, with electric sender. Looks like it's even threaded
for the VW oil-pressure sender location. Maybe put it there and use a tee 
fitting?
Don't know when I can get to it, tho...
