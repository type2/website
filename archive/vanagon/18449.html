Subject: oil galleries


Do you think it would be OK to drill and tap my type 4 oil galleries without taking the whole thing apart.
You know how difficult it is to drill and tap freehand without mounting the case on a drill press  --and the 
aluminum (or magnesium?)  chips could get wher you dont want them.  Or would it be better to peen the 
hades out of the aluminum around the pesky plugs and run straight 40 wieght casterol to  prevent/mimimize 
oil loss.
