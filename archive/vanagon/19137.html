    Hi all
    
        Is anybody going to the Bug Jam this weekend. I will be 
setting off from Manchester about lunchtime tommorrow. Is anybody 
else going from this direction at about that time. I will be in a 
blue 71 camper which looks very similar to the one featured in 
the July Volksworld, (but a bit rougher). The reg. is BFU 822K, if 
anybody sees me please make yourself known. I will be looking out for 
Lee Grifiths Samba now that I've seen what it looks lik, (very nice!)

                   
                            Cheers
                                    Jon
