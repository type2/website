&gt;
&gt; The sporadic sightings and information about 97 EV's suggests that they
&gt;have already been imported, at least in a few places. As I recall, they
&gt;have been examined in North Carolina, Missouri (Bap?), and Seattle (Rick
&gt;Gordon). My local dealer says there are no plans to bring them in here
&gt;until at least next spring and that they haven't even gone into production
&gt;yet in Germany.


When I was in Germany last Spring, the new model Eurovans were in some
showrooms.  I have some literature on them from the dealers, all in German
of course.
