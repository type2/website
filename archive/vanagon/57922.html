Subject: Re: EV &quot;Winnie&quot; VR6 sighting

&quot;Yesterday I saw a parked Eurovan long wheelbase model with Winnebago pop
top conversion. It had windows on all sides but the left rearmost third.
Was all white including the front grill and looked nice. Most interesting
was the emblem on the front said 'VR6'. I didn't realize they are putting 6
cyclinder engines in these, thought it was a 2.5L 5 cylinder. Is this
something new? Also it had an additional grill on the right front fender.&quot;

This is the new '97 EV Camper.  The 5-cyl was the only engine available for
'93, and '95.  The VR6 and the new grills are also new for 1997.  The engine
is a 2.8 liter producing 140hp.  Some novel features of the new Camper are
low-speed traction control, revised and easy to understand climate controls
(pet peeve of mine about my 93 EV GL), standard Dual Airbags and ABS.  It
also gets side impact door beams, a couple extra tail lights.  Nicer hub caps
are also standard.

Down grades are the lack of a glove compartment, a cheap &quot;EuroVan Camper&quot;
sticker on the back instead of previous metal badging, and only being
available in the white color.  The missing rear window on left side is
normal, but I still don't know what the extra fender grill is for.  It is
also shown on my 1996 German Transporter and Caravelle/Multivan brochures.
