Subject:      TRISTARless

Some scum sucking %$#%$#%$%$%$%$$$%%%% stole, torched and put our TRISTAR
over a cliff yesterday. Wife had it down the local shopping centre came
out and it was gone. Insurance wanker said lucky it was is insured and
they will pay up - how do we find a replacement - anyone got a TRISTAR
for sale? Have to go and cry myself to sleep now.
