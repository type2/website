&gt; Has there ever been any consideration giving to splitting up the list in to a
&gt; couple different list like say one for each of the major models - split
&gt; windshield, Bay window, Vanagon, &amp; Eurovan?  That way an individual could
&gt; sign on to one or all depending on his/her interests.

Ho boy, I can see where this thread is gonna go.  

The problem with that is taking the basic list admin doodies and triping/
quadrupling/??? them.  Sure its nice to only see what you're particularly
interested in, but you have to look at it from the other side of the
fence.  I'm a SysAdmin myself, so I kinda understand the problems...

You might want to look into some sort of mail filtering.  You personally
are stuck with AOL, and I'm not aware of any mail/news filtering on
that &quot;system&quot; but people using other ISP's via PPP and Windoze can
use the filtering of say Pegasus Mail or Eudora.  Those REAL men (and
women) among us with shell accounts can use filter(1) or procmail(1).

But then again a barndoor list would be nice...

How do REAL men and women program?
