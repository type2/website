&gt; Hi: I don't know how common block heaters are in the States. The Tristar
&gt; I have came from Canada and it is equiped with a block heater that is a
&gt; 3/4&quot; thick plastic block 

I would have sworn that it was aluminum.

&gt; with heating elements in it that fits under and
&gt; against the engine block. I could climb underneath to see if I can find
&gt; any markings or part numbers if I was coaxed. I bring this up because
&gt; this is the only one I have ever seen and assume it is a VW piece. 

They are very common in Canada and yes I believe they are a VW part.
