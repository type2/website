Subject:      EUROVAN POPTOP CAMPER

Howdy again. Someone laid this on me at Westfalia Wanderers meet at Caeser
Creek State Park in Ohio about a month ago. It is pretty interesting. Here
goes:


                        EUROVAN POPTOP CAMPER

** Based on long wheelbase (131 inches, or 3.33 meters) Eurovan Panel Van
   (no center/rear seats, no side windows, etc.)

** Ordered &quot;conversion ready&quot; with such amenities as Front A/C; power locks,
windows and mirrors; cruise control and front swivel seats. Dual airbags will
be added as standard equipment when airbag production for all Eurovans begins
in April 1994.

** WINNEBAGO adds a &quot;poptop&quot; roof, windows with screens, and seating for two
(or four) more passengers. Standard and Optional (*) features include:

-Two burner stove -Stainless Steel Sink/Countertop -12 gallon freshwater tank
-8 gallon gray water tank (NOTE: I WISH I HAD THIS!) -74&quot; x 43&quot; upper bed
(1.88 x 1.09 meters) -generous (??) cabinet space -3 way, two cubic foot
refrigerator -rear bench/ 74&quot; x 43&quot; bed (2 person) * removable 2 person center
seat * 12,000 BTU propane furnace -5.9 gallon propane tank -auxillary
battery/110 converter


** WINNEBAGO has captured the essence of traditional WESTFALIA design while
updating it with many extra features that U.S. buyers will appreciate. Pricing
has not been confirmed yet, but the target sticker price of this 1995 model
vehicle (w/o airbags) is under $30,000, with many over $40,000.

** With its full cadre of equipment and traditional design, we expectmany of
our current camper enthusiasts to embrace this new camper alternative. In
addition, the availability of a removable center seat will widen our appeal to
more young families who need a single vehicle that fulfills both family
transportation and lifestyle needs.


DISTRIBUTION

** VOLKSWAGEN will sell the Panel Van only to authorized Volkswagen retailers.
The retailer will separately purchase the WINNEBAGO conversion directly from
WINNEBAGO.
