Subject: stupid starte mistake!
Date: Thu, 19 Oct 1995 16:51:25 -0400 (EDT)

Yesterday will replacing my starter on my 86 vanagon I made a really
stupid mistake.  I was inserting the small brash bushing that was to be 
installed before  inseting starter it slipped and fall between flywheel and bell housing. So know my guess is is at or near bottom of bell housing.
How can I get it out? Do I need to pull transmisson, bell housing, etc??
There is a small plug (1&quot;) under transaxle but I assume this is for transmissionfluid. It looked as if there might be small bottom section of bell housing that
might come off by itself but now i think its only lines of aluminumn casting.

Any ideas??

Anthony
