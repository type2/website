Any 12v relay WON'T work.  Most relays (rated at 3, 5 or 10 amps) simply
cannot carry enough current for a starter application which can draw
something like 30 amps.  The big Ford starter relays are used because they're
made to handle this application. A smaller capacity relay could either burn
it's contacts off and just not work, or worse the contacts could weld
themselves together, not allowing you the ability to stop the starter.
Be careful out there.
