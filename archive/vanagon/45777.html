Subject: Re: Nuts!...Axle Nuts!

Claralw_at_aol wrote &quot;As for the nut, I actually thin(k) that it has fused 
with the brake drum.  .   .   .   .   Does anyone out there have a 46mm 
axle nut for  a '67 kombi/westy?  I am beginning to think that I will 
have to cut this one off...&quot;
 
  Ok, I mentioned this one to one of my many years experienced truck 
mechanic wizards.  He said he'd take a chisel and place it on the side of 
the nut, with the chisel edge parallel to the threaded shaft's axis, and 
give it a nice cut.  He said this disturbes the threads and &quot;stretches&quot; 
the nut so that it can be loosened.  If that fails, using the chisel to 
help rotation with the &quot;blue wrench&quot; (torch) and the now familiar cheater 
bar offer the normal options.

  Compared with the stuff he considers big, this isn't, so dealing with 
this kind of effort is a regular event for him.
