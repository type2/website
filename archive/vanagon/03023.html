Well folks,  I am not a happy camper!  VW still has my '91 Camper
and are having the resistor pack which has supposed to be bad shipped
from the East.  This is the second one they are getting because the
first one was wrong!  This is Niello VW in Sacramento folks.  Please
remember that one the next time you need repairs and you're looking
for a place to get it fixed.  I DO NOT recommend them, AT ALL!  The 
part is $31.00 but the labor for getting up into the cavity where the 
part resides and the diagnoses is costing me $270.00!!!.  Needless to 
say, I AM PISSED!!  I'm supposed to go on my trip a 4:00AM on Saturday 
and I don't have my van!  In the future I'll put in some kind of access
panel (if possible) so that this piece-o-shit can be swapped out without
pulling apart the cabinets.
