Sounds like a vacuum leak. Check the rubber tubes between the intake
runners and the intake manifold. Spray a nonflammable carb cleaner on an
area while the engine is acting up and listen for the RPMs to change.

&gt;Hello;  Recently my 87 GL has taken on another character trait.  after
&gt;running enough to get the temperature up, the idle stays at 2000 rpm.
&gt;Sometimes (about 1 in 10) it will drop back to 1000. Another (possibly
&gt;related) symptom is when de-cellerating the van will hiccup, similar 
&gt;to
&gt;running out of gas sensation.  I checked the engine compartment for 
&gt;obvious
&gt;problems, nothing, everything is tight with nothing dis-connected.  
&gt;Oh, I
&gt;recently had the engine compartment pressure washed, and these 
&gt;symptoms
&gt;started after that.  What is the problem?  Where should I start?
