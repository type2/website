Subject: Re: Waterproof window sealant?

couldn't help myself but make a quick response to this one. I must confess
I am a total junkie of liquid silicon related products. That stuff can be
used for so many applications!!!

 Up here in the land of rust I keep many total rustbuckets patched up with
that stuff. While the structural integrity of a vehicle filled with liquid
silicone is debateable, it is far more likely to bounce when in an
accident! Seriously though if you own a shitbox daily driver that you don't
want to spend $$ on, buy a caulking gun and a big tube of liquid silicone,
and go crazy! BTW the large tube of caulking you use w/ a caulking gun are
cheaper (proportionately) than the same stuff in squeeze tubes (brands like
&quot;Goop&quot; especially!)

&gt;&gt;About a month ago, someone posted about a product by 3m which was some
&gt;&gt;kind of sealant goop you could put around/in/under your window &quot;seals&quot; to
&gt;&gt;keep the rain out. Anybody heard of this stuff or something similar? I've
&gt;&gt;had my windshields replaced as well as the seals, but they still leak
&gt;&gt;rain water onto my stereo. Help!!
&gt;
&gt;if it was 3M, it was probably me. :)  the stuff i use is 3M Heavy Drip-Check
&gt;Sealer, part number 08531 ... but you'll have to get it at the folks who sell
&gt;supplies to the body shop repair people. look in the yellow pages for the
&gt;Auto Repair Suppliers catagory.
&gt;
&gt;you'll also want to get some 3M General Purpose Adhesive Remover ... to clean
&gt;up any oozing out from under the rubber. this stuff works great on bugs and
&gt;road tar, too. it leaves a little white film, but that washes off with water.
