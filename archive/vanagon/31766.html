Subject: Re: f/  '65 Bus Coolant Hoses

I took a break from what is going to be many hours of library work on the 
computer and read the following.  Suddenly the day seemed brighter and I 
realized I could walk across the Locks and take a walk in Discovery 
Park.  Good humor frees vaporlock...Jeff Olson, Seattle...

&gt; To All:
&gt; 
&gt; I decided to replace the coolant hoses on my 1965 bus before making the run
&gt; to Big Sur this weekend.  
&gt; 
&gt; Left Hose: 89 cents
&gt; 
&gt; Right Hose: 89 cents
&gt; 
&gt; Total:  $1.88
&gt; 
&gt; Had I purchased the hoses from Volkswagen, they would have cost a total of $3
&gt; !
&gt; 
&gt; Now if I can just figure out how to keep water out of my cooling system...
