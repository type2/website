I don't believe its just contact cleaner.  I have not used that
particular product but it is more likely an anti-oxident and cleaner.  I
have used a similar product named Cramolin and it actually removes the
oxide layer on contacts and provides a protective layer.  Designed for
&quot;signal&quot; level lines like sensor contacts and such.  I have also used
&quot;NO-OX&quot; paste that electricians use when connecting Aluminum wires so
that they don't lose contact from corrosion. On small contacts I thin it
in solvent and apply with a Q-tip. Usually available anywhere electrical
supplies are sold and MUCH cheaper.
