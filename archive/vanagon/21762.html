Subject: HOW TO ORDER T-SHIRTS

I do not know how the printing people will respond, but, since they
will be doing all the necessary work anyway, I wonder if they'd mind
printing on those strange iron-on transfer sheets???  In case they do,
that should cost a lot less, and should leave us with a nifty cache of
iron-ons for future T-shirts...  I'd be interested in getting a couple
of those...
