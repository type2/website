Subject: Ireland VW Attractions

My parents are planning their &quot;Dream Trip of a Lifetime&quot; to Ireland.  
They will be there from late May thru June.  Are there any VW events 
and/or VW attractions (Old Tyme Dealerships, etc.) that I can persuade 
them to check out?  Lookin' for soo-VW-n-eers ...
