Subject: geographic subdivisions

&gt;I feel that I deserve a new catagory.  Nothern California is Redding North!
&gt;Jsut ask anyone who lives in Northern CA.  Call it CA.NN if you like. But
&gt;I think California is big enough to have more then just North and South.
&gt;Heck Siskiyou County (in which McCloud is the Gem) has to be as large or
&gt;larger then PA.C.  How about giving me my geographic due.

Don't let him do it, Joel.
This sort of thing has no end.  Here in Tennessee, there are really 
three states: East TN, Central TN, and West TN.  All different.
