Subject: Color sanding? good/bad?

&gt;From: martino_at_EARTHLINK.NET

&gt;I've heard guys say they color sand their cars prior to
&gt;buffing/waxing.

DB&amp;HVW had an article a few years ago that detailed (pardon
the pun) this procedure.  Those people swore by it.

&gt;Is this a good idea?  What grit paper #600 or #1000?

A *good* idea?  Maybe.  It is particularly effective if you
got a bad paint job (read runs and sags) and want to smooth
it out.  If you get a *great* paint job, you may not need
it.  As for grit, #600 at least, #1000 is better and finer
would be best if you can find it.

&gt;How long must I wait after painting my van till I can do
&gt;this?

It depends on the type of paint, but most current paint
should cure fast enough that you could do the work a few
days after painting.  Decide *before* you have the painting
done.  Let the painter know you are going to do it so he can
lay it on thick instead of thin.  The last thing you want is
*burn through*, that is sanding through the color coat you
just paid for.

&gt;Martin  '71 bus going into paint shop on Monday.

Yes, I tried it.  I painted my 1967 Deluxe myself with
DuPont Centari (acrylic enamel) with a *wet look* hardener.
I color sanded the Pearl White above the belt line and on
the roof, only had one burn through, and it looks alright.
I then tried (just the rear hatch) sanding the Velvet Green
below the belt line and stopped.  Now maybe it just needs
more sanding.  Maybe it needs more buffing.  Maybe it needs
more polishing.  But the rear hatch just does not look as
good as the rest of the green paint I did not sand.

My recommendation?  If you trust your body shop to do a
fantastic paint job, you do not need to color sand.  If
there are runs or sags when you get your bus back, try color
sanding in a low-profile area and see what you think.

If you need your bus for transportation next week, forget
it...you are in for a lot of sanding, buffing, polishing and
waxing.

My 2 cents.

If you really want more information, I might be able to
track down the DB&amp;HVW article.  Let me know.
