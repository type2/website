Subject: gopher announcement

Ok, guys.  I've put up a gopher server on this machine.  I figure 160 
people can't do too much damange :-).

It's not and isn't going to be a registered gopher server.
gopher to halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu
Path is 

Miscellaneous
    Vanagon

URL: gopher://halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:70/11/Miscellaneous/Vanagon

I can put other files there pretty easily.  
When I get a chance, I'll pull the tech bulletins and the pseudo FAQ out and 
put them in.
