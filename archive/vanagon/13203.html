&gt; Same thing for those people that pull out from a side street right
&gt; in front cause they think you're going to be too slow.  Ugh!!
&gt; 
   This one ticks me off the most, absolutely anyone thinks they
can pull anything out in front of a VW Bus, they obviously don't
realize that if it is going at speed (such that it is) it's pretty
hard to drag it down quickly with four drums or even solid front
rotors.  And as for emergency lane changing maneuvers, well good
luck and change your undergarmets.

Of course I have another problem, I always start driving the
bus like the Corrado, a nearly deadly habbit.
