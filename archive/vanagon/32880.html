Subject: Trip report-Inks lake, Texas

Hey now,
        The trip was a success! The bus performed well, near as I can tell
we got around 18mpg, with the spare carb that I put on last week (from
solex 34p3 to borsal 30/31p). That's up from the 14-15 we were getting the
last time I checked several months ago. Mechanically everything was kosher,
our ride transported us and the dog in style.
        We took off on Friday, about 6:30 pm. I'd wanted to leave at about
3 pm, but things just didn't work out. So we're half way to the lake, about
45 min. from home, when we realize that the directions we promised to leave
in the mailbox for Samantha's friend from work were on the coffee table.
Doh! Turned around, went home, put 'em back in the mailbox. Finally back on
the road at 8:30pm, I kinda put the hammer down. Did about 65-70 'cause I
was worried that they'd lock up the gates at 10pm. They do that down at
McKinney falls state park, I was worried it might be a normal thing. Got to
Inks Lake at 10:04 pm-no gates! Had all the usual joys of setting up camp
in the dark and cold. Done it so many times it was routine-I always seem to
run late...   ;-)
        Weather was great! Plenty cold at night-low 40's to high 30's, but
the daytimes were georgeous at 70+!  Had BBQ steak for dinner friday night,
steak 'n eggs for sat breakfast, hamburgers for sat dinner. Sam says she's
never eaten so much red meat in her life. Eggs, pancakes, &amp; bacon for
breakfast on sun.
        Spent most of the day sat. and sun. morning fishing, caught
nothing, zilch, nada. However, sat. evening we were out fishing and struck
up a conversation with the older couple next to us. Turns out they were
from California as well, so we chatted about things for a while. They
caught 3 bass, using shiners for bait, we caught 2 tires using worms for
bait. So they get ready to leave, &amp; he says (to his wife)&quot;Peg, you want to
do anything with these here fish?&quot; &quot;No, not really.&quot; &quot;Well, you mind if we
just give 'em to the kids?&quot;  So we ended up with 3 bass! Not as good as
catching them ourselves, but fresh fish is fresh fish! This was about 7pm,
which is why we iced 'em and had hamburgers sat. evening.  BBQ'd 'em up
sun. night at home-mighty good stuff, with no nasty fishy taste. Anyway,
the trip was good fun, hopefully next time we can get some more busses out
there, maybe start the Texas camping crazies!! Hope y'all had as much fun
with your weekend...

Peace,
