Subject: Power Locks Frozen Up

Ever since the weather got colder, the power locks on my '87 Westy seem 
to be 'frozen' - not as in 'frozen with ice in the lock', but like the 
electrical connections are preventing the locks from moving. When I turn 
the key or press down the lock button, there's a huge resistance, like 
with 2 resisting magnets, &amp; they just don't lock.  Not conducive for 
taking my van on outtings into the city!  This happened last winter too, 
&amp; finally cleared itself up around June.  Who knows, maybe it has 
absolutely nothing to do with the weather - I'm in Seattle &amp; it's not 
cold like Minnesota - but regardless, help!!

Any ideas?  I don't know much about VW engines, let alone electrical 
systems, but if somebody could point me in the right direction I'd 
appreciate it!

Also, it has become apparent to me that as a Vanagon owner I really need 
to learn how to maintain &amp; repair it myself.  Any suggestions for 
elementary books, other than Bentley, which I've heard is more for the 
already-initiated?

Thanks!
Kathy
