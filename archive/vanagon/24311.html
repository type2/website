&gt;&gt;Any thoughts (or lacking that, any experience) installing and using
&gt;&gt;non-stock ratio rocker arms?

&gt;&gt;What is the stock ratio anyway - ? 1:1.1 ?

Yep. Stocks are 1.1 to 1.
I bought a set of ratio rockers from Claudes Buggies about 8 mos ago for my
Notchback, and am quite happy with them. They do give the car a little more pep.
The set I purchased was less than $100.00, and are actual VW forgings that have
the socket for the end of the pushrod drilled just slightly closer to the
centerline of the rocker shaft, thus increasing the ratio.

Would I buy them again? Maybe. Buy them only if you have an extra buck laying
around. The difference isn't that dramatic, if that's what you are looking for.
