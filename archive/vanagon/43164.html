&gt;&gt;You could have the ring and pinion changed to match the performance of the
&gt;&gt;engine
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Well, yes, but the range of available R&amp;P sets for that tranny are VERY
&gt;limited. The V6anagon has a final ratio of 0.85. With the tallest R&amp;P
&gt;available, I could make it 0.82. The difference would be practically
&gt;unnoticable, and not nearly enough for what the V6anagon needs. I tried
&gt;putting big tires on it (215/75R14), but those didn't help much either.
&gt;In fact, the speedo is EXACTLY accurate, meaning not much has changed.
&gt;
&gt; You are lucky enough th live down where the tranny action is . Mendeola
Racing in Chula Vista has 4.57 ring and pinions that will fit a 002 box. I
belive the diesel tranny  has 002 shafts in it rather than 091 parts. Mike
Mendeola uses stock ring and pinions and cuts and welds them to the right
configuration to fit the ratio of choice to the tranny of choice. It sounds
kinda scary welding on the pinion shaft but most all small engined race cars
(1776cc _at_ about 120 hp) us his parts so they can use the 4.57 ring and
pinion with 002 gearsets with no problem. You also have Mike Thornton at ITS
in Santee close to you. They are a very quality shop that only does tranny
work and specialize in VWs. I recently had my Syncro trans rebuilt there.
They have done a lot of Syncros and showed me where someone else had worked
it and actually installed the wrong parts. They did a great job. I would
recomend them highly. 
 Mendeola is now selling a VW based tranny that uses a 9&quot; Ford ring and
pinion. Its killer. It won't fit into a stock VW without modification but it
is a really cool piece. I build the differentials for Mike and they are
huge. They utilize Ford spyder gears. There should be a spread in Hot VWs
next month about this new tranny.
