If the adjustment between the front and back latches is off, it may 
not be fully latching, thereby allow the door to open unexpectedly.
The primary latching is done at the rear.

To correct this situation, you'll first have to remove the panel on 
the door. There is an adjustment nut at the rear of the front latch 
mechanism.  Play with that, opening and closing door to see the effect 
on the ability of the door to stay closed.

&gt; I don't want to convert my slider to a hinged model BUT I have a problem
&gt; closing the darn thing, predominately in cold weather. It slides ok but will
&gt; not latch properly (normally when the temp. is below freezing, of course).
&gt; Just about lost the dog the other day going down the highway...
&gt; I've cleaned and lubed the tracks and lathes but it doesn't seem to help
&gt; that much. Does anyone have a solution to this problem?
