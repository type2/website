Glad to hear the Big Sur trip was a success, sorry I couldn't make it!

&gt; Voting time!  Possible dates for West Pretour Orgy # 2:
&gt; 
&gt; March 17-19
&gt; March 24-16
&gt; 
&gt; Register your preferences with me, and I'll try to keep track of
&gt; them.  Those failing to respond will get no beer.

Well, Janice is a full time student this semester so it would have to
be spring break for us (March 13-19).  Therefore, I vote for March 17-19.

The Twentynine Palms area is quite doable from Tucson, maybe even a little
further north...  Anybody know anything about Providence Mountains State
Recreation area (off I-40 between Barstow and the AZ border)?

As David says, Red Rock Canyon is nice (I've camped there once)
and I might be able to get there in a day's drive.  Its a great Mojave
*desert* location!  This is near the site of the biannual So. Cal. cannon
party that I have been involved with, but thats another, noisy, story.
