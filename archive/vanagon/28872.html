trying to 
&gt;     evaluate whether performance is up to spec or not.

&gt;     Seems like top speed under standard conditions would be a good
indicator of 
&gt;     power output.
&gt;     
&gt;     Does anyone want to share information on their Westphalias' top speed? by 
&gt;     engine size and trans configuration?

Pat, my '71 westy will go approximately 75 at break-neck speed. (Ideal no
wind -dry pavement- tepid temperature) While I don't make it a habit of
going that fast in a Vw that is the fastest I've had my Westy.  The engine
is an AH series Beetle 1600 dual port with a sstock stick. the only thing it
has is the 009 distributer, everything else is bone stock including trans.
Although I believe the trans is from a newer Bus than mine?
