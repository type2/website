Subject:      Re: 84 Westy

We are about to pick up our '84 Westy - today (!!!!!) - minor dings in
body and bumper, 148K, no engine rebuild (yet), needs 3 tires, no A/C.
We're also not sure the fridge works - propane tank needs some work.  He
has the front table, though.  We're paying $3000, but expect to throw
another $2000 at it over the next year or so.

Where are you located?  $8995 sounds high - I had asked listmembers about
price a week or so ago, and the consensus was $4-5000 if everythings in
excellent shape. (Thanks again, all - I would have been completely
clueless without your advice!).  Kelley blue book site gave retail as
around $4500, if I remember correctly (http://www.kbb_dot_com).

Hope this helps.

&gt; I'm looking at an 84 Westy with 70,000 miles (service records verify this).
&gt; It appears to be in pretty good shape -- minor dings here and there -- needs
&gt; a windshield, spigot for sink (owner says $30) -- there is a very slight
&gt; amount of rust along a seam at RR.  Front table is absent, but otherwise
&gt; everything looks preety good.  Oh yes -- he claims refrig. works on AC and
&gt; DC, but hasn't tried propane.  Hasn't tried stove either...
&gt; Owner asks $8995, but will negotiate...
&gt; Anybody have a feel for the value of this vehicle??
&gt; Any help would really be appreciated.
