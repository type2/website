Dear Harry,
   This is kind of an unconventional fix, but it sure leveled out my westy.
   I used the upper spring seat as a pattern and cut a round spacer of the
same size,
with a hole of the same diameter in the center.  I used a thin blade jig
saw to cut it out of a 1/2&quot;solid plastic board.  I inserted the spacer
between the upper spring seat and the car frame.  See chapter 42.2 in the
Bentley manual.
The washers are doing just fine.  The tires seem to be ok too.  The car
handles a bit nicer on right turns,  especially when heavily loaded. I
think VW should have compensated the spring strength on the left side for
the campers, particularly for the weight of the filled water tank.

&gt; Harald, thanks for your info!  Appreciate it.  Your idea of putting
&gt; &quot;washers&quot; in, did you put those in at the top or bottom of the
&gt; springs?  Are they wearing OK?
&gt;
&gt; Harry.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Can't you install some washers over the rear springs on your syncro?
