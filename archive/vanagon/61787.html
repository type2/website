Subject: Re: Asbestos in VWs

&gt; Volkswagen could still impress me. They could be forthright. They could be
&gt; honest.

They would not be VWoA in recent years.

&gt; They could say publicly what the private policy is, and there
&gt; obviously is a private policy. I hope they choose this course.

Ken is becoming subject to hysteria and delusion, he must have 
started smoking the horse hair padding falling from his seats :-)

&gt; If not, though, the information that does not come through them will come
&gt; around them. Volkswagen AG, meet the internet. Pleased, so nice you could
&gt; come. We've heard so much about you.

Yeah we thought you were dead, about the same time as K Moon.  OH YOU 
ARE DEAD IN THIS COUNTRY I'm sorry to bother you.

But shit, since Nick is bringing me boxes, valves, and tubes for the 
'77, '78, AND '81 (what I figure to be $2500 list from VW) for 
free and as I don't give a rats ass about asbestos, I am not 
complaining.  I'm really hoping for replacement of the asbestos seals 
on the BA6 as I've been meaning to remove it from the '81 but the 
joint connectors are rusted together, if he breaks, he fixes.  Am I 
abusing this, damn right serves them right to the tune of a $200 
driveshaft, $60 wheel bearing, and $250 O2 sensor on the Corrado G60 
that all SHOULD have been replaced under warranty, let alone the damn 
clutch, gee uh we'll replace them for a couple years then stop and 
deny knowledge we ever did, can you say a wasserleakin precedent.

bitterness still surfaces, saw 3 Corrado's today (real uncommon) missed mine
for about 30 seconds each time (well missed mine for 60 seconds when the 
one beside me at the stop light was driven by an attractive young professional 
female, driving the Bus wasn't much of a conversation piece.
