Ben,

Loctite Corporation provides two primers to insure proper curing of their
product, one is Locquic Primer T, the other Klean n' Prime.  You should be
able to procure either from the dealer selling Loctite.  And stick to that
brand, or use a primer specific to the thread adhesive you're using; the
Loctite primer is not compatible with the Hercules adhesives, etc.  

The Loctite p/n for Klean n' Prime is 2556.  It comes in a 6-oz spray-can.
 Rather pricey but one can lasts for years.  The cleaning is via
trichloroethane, so don't use it in an unventilated area.  The priming is in
the form of accelerants that cause the Loctite adhesive to harden more
quickly.

If you're speaking of a Type IV engine designed to use hydraulic valve
lifters, the oil galleries are of the proper size.  I can't say as to the
gallery size in the non-hydraulic 1.7 engines.  I know guys have retrofitted
hydraulics to them but don't recall any mention of opening up the galleries
(or of problems).

Noisy lifters are usually a sign of worn lifter bores (ie, low oil pressure),
overheating (low oil pressure) or contaminated oil.  If the noise is isolated
to a single valve, I would suspect a valve problem, such as a loose seat, an
improperly adjusted rocker, or a dirty lifter.  The first of these problems
would be persistant, the second would respond to inspection/adjustment and
the third might vanish with an oil change.  You are the Mechanic In Charge;
what's your opinion?

-Bob
