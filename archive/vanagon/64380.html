&gt;Shortly after embarking on our first trip in our new '88 Westfalia, my wife
&gt;commented that she would really like a 'pocket' on her door like the one on
&gt;the driver's side door.  Well, I could understand that right away, 'cause I
&gt;liked the convenience of the one on the driver's side.
&gt;
&gt;So I ordered one for the passenger side door.  Upon taking the passenger
&gt;side interior door panel off, to install the pocket, I found the panel was
&gt;pre-drilled, as I had expected to mount the door pocket.  Ah,,, all is
&gt;well, fits like a charm.
&gt;
&gt;It was a week later that I tried to open the glove box (on the passenger
&gt;side naturally) with that side's door closed.... Guess what.  The glove box
&gt;won't open now with the door closed!
&gt;
&gt;I may be able to make some small adjustments to both to enable enough of an
&gt;opening to stuff something in or grab something with a slim hand, but the
&gt;clearance is probably the reason why VW didn't put pockets on both doors in
&gt;1988.

I did exactly the same thing - &amp; suffered exactly the same embarassment;
replace it with one of those fabric pockets that has an elastic along the
top, or tell everyone it's a safety feature to keep the glove box closed
while driving!!
