Friday;
After getting various replies from the list about my housemates
leaking bell housing (thanx to everyone who replied), I went
home and played with the bus. It seems that in his case only, 
the oil leak is related to the crankcase breather being connected, 
but not the way round I would expect ie. when you disconnect
the breather, oil leaks out of the bell housing ??? Very wierd.
So in a very unlikley way the leak is now cured :)

Saturday;
A guy came round with a van full of vw related bits. He is
doing a round the world trip in a couple of weeks and was in a
hurry to get rid of the bits at any price, so I got two 1600
dual port engines, mostly complete (without tinware/carb/etc), and 
three heat exchangers for 25 quid :). Those two along with a sized 1600
single port in the garage means three engines to rebuild.

Sunday;
Went along to the VW swap meet at Stonleigh and got some bits
n pieces for the bus (including a clock) and a beautiful little 
pweter type model of a bay window bus. :)

Monday;
Offered most of an early 2.0 litre engine, when the owner has
finished rebuilding his replacement. :) Great, I'll take it (my 
bus runs a 2.0 litre and parts are hard to find here).
4 engines to rebuild.

Tue;
A work mate offers me his Honda CB400N at a very good price, :)
but guess what, it need an engine rebuild. Ok I'll take it, sort
it out, sell it and finance the bus road tax that is due soon.
5 engines to rebuild.
 
Wed;
Went to pick up the Honda. On the way back, my oil light flickers on.
Then off, then on again and stays on. Oh no, panic sets in, go to stop 
somewhere (I'm on a dual carrigeway with no hard shoulder). I pull into 
a parking area and go to see whats happened. There is very little oil 
on the dipstick; its all over the crankcase. Also cylinder 3 or 4 
appears to have given up the ghost. :( :( :( Sounds and looks pretty 
terminal. Ah well, 6 engines to rebuild......... 

This is Marcus rounding up 5 days of a vw enthusiasts life,
smiles=5, frowns=3. smiles win.
and now back to the studio...

cheers
Marcus
'70 bus and a lot of assorted junk.
