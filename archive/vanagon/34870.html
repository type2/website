&gt;The poll results are in - looks like the best date for the majority of

&gt;I'm trying to find a location which is sort of midway between S. CA, and N. CA,
&gt;and need some suggestions.  Thinking about trying to do winter camping
&gt;in the snow, but will probably need AC for heaters, etc.
&gt;
&gt;Give me your thoughts!

(I'm not blowing you off.  REALLY.)
