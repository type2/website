I may be in the process of working out a deal to trade my ''86 Cougar 
which has turned a bearing and is on the vergte of throwing a rod for the 
bus repairs.
&gt; Maybe you can start over?
&gt;  Can you get your bread back??

WE'll see today.  I'm going to press the whole, &quot;It's illegal to sell a 
vehicle with a broken speedometer&quot; thing.  I'll see if I can't get a few 
bucks back.
&gt;     Did you fall in love???
&gt;        If it spoke i to you, ya gotta stand by your  v  a  n  : )

I'll give it two arms to cling to, and someone warm to come to when 
nights are cold and lonely.      : )
