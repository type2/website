&gt;Sorry for the confusion.

Bob,

Thanks for the clarification. I assume that I should stick with the original 
bearings then (hoping they are good). The salesman at Wolfgang says that they 
are not mfg'd anymore. 
Is the procedure you described for the ball joint R&amp;R in general similar for 
the van?
