     Hi all,
     
     Just a word of warning for you split owners wishing to id. your 
     splitties optional extras.
     
     My '64 De-Luxe doesn't have any of the listed optional extras, but 
     clearly physically has them ie. Golde Sunroof etc..
     
     The point is that I beleive unless the options you have, eg. M75 - mud 
     flaps, were already part of your buses spec then you won't have them 
     listed as option extras. So my bus does not list a sun roof because it 
     wasn't a requested option on my bus, it came out of the factory like 
     that. 
     
     I also have some option numbers which aren't listed. my mate Danny has 
     about six option numbers as well, none of which are listed. As a 
     result of reading the Volksworld article we came to the conclusion 
     that we were no more knowledgable as to how our buses look when they 
     rolled off the line.
     
     Also Danny's chassis number starts with 224 (I think) which isn't 
     listed with the other chassis numbers as exsiting - weird,
     
     Lee.
