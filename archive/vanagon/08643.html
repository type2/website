&gt; &gt; OK so by that logic (to play devil's advocate) no. 1 should also run hot,
&gt; &gt; because in the suitcase engine the fan is smack dab in the middle and the
&gt; &gt; two rear cylinders even if they are staggered are equidistant from the fan
&gt; &gt; and the exit as well....I am wondering if the foklore about no. 3 carried
&gt; &gt; over to all air-cooled engines regardless of design, and I would believe
&gt; &gt; if I hadn't also heard about strengthening/welding no.3 cylinder in Vanagon
&gt; &gt; engines because of  some weak point.....another myth?    DC

&gt; &gt; -- 
&gt; &gt; To your first point, I don't agree. Cylinder #1 is further rearward in the
&gt;   car (okay, okay, it's only a couple inches). You can check this on your
&gt;   Vanagon by looking where the spark plug wires go through the sheet metal.
&gt;   
&gt;   I have heard mention too about welding up something in Type 1 cases around
&gt;   cylinder #3, but I don't understand why it is done. Could it be related to
&gt;   pulling studs?

Dave: could a couple of inches really cause no. 3 to run hotter? anyone
know? as for the second point, in both GEXs that I installed in the
westy, the no. 3 was welded at a point right around the studs, so that
could be it, hmmm no. 3 runs hot, stud loosens, small leak develops, no. 3
exhaust valve burns out due to lean mixture. recipe for disaster, nipped
in the bud? DC
