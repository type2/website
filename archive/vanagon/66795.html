&gt;sorry to repost this. it seems some servers don't care for the new
&gt;internet explorer, me either  :-/ !  so here goes using netscape...

I noticed that your first post had an attachement while your second post
did not.  On the assumption that you actively changed browsers to
eliminate the attachment, I wanted to thank you for being considerate to
list members.

If you were just lucky, well keep it up. ;)

I hate to receive attachments that just replicate the post. I have
received several of these from mailing lists over the last 2 months.
Though I do not recall them coming in droves from the VW list.

It seems that many of the new browsers are in the attachment business.

Thanks to everyone who takes steps to avoid sending them out. They are
definitely a nuisance to find and delete and a possible source of viruses.
