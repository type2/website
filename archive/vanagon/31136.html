Subject: RE: How to fix a rear window defogger?


&gt;So is there anyway to &quot;redo&quot; the traces, or should I find a good window
&gt;in the junk yards?


JC Whitney used to have aftermarket rear window defrosters of different
sizes/number of traces. Some were imbedded in clear plastic sheets, which
had a tendency to yellow with age. Others were just the copper traces
themselves, with some sort of adhesive to stick them onto the window.

Don't have a Whitney catalog handy, but might be able to find one if you
need numbers/prices. They were a lot less expensive than a new window, tho.

A FLAPS might also have them. Try Kragen, Pep Boys, Chief?
