&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I just took my EuroVan in for its 15K mile maintenance.
&gt; My dealer is saying it is $135.  My recollection is
&gt; that the '93 Eurovan had a 2 year no-cost maintenance
&gt; package.  Is this true?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; A speedy reply would help since my Van is in the shop today....
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in Advance,
&gt; 
&gt;

Yes, there is a 2 year warranty but if any 'normal maintenance' items
are fixed/changed, it is not covered under the warranty.  The 2 year
warranty covers factory defects, etc.
