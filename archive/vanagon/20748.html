Subject: Vanagon door locks [Q]

Hi, just want to find out if I am alone in this. '85 lock cylinders wore out 
in drivers and sliding doors, '87 same. You can open with a dime turned in 
the coverslot, high security. Is this normal/me, and is there a fix? I read 
the rekeying in the FAQ. Anything else? and.... why hasn't the ignition 
switch died to this level, since it gets used more than either lock likely?  
tim s.
 

ps: no one is to sneak into my van now, promise? please!
 Sure you can afford to steal it,
 but can you afford to maintain it, heh heh.
