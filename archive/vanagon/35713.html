Subject: Re: F/ Mr Hollands Opus - Bus

I just went to see this also, a very good movie IMHO.  But, it appeared 
to me that during the second scene (in front of their new house) there 
was a good sized crease on the front left edge and onto the driver's side 
door. I guess that I will have to go and check it out again to double 
check myself 8^)
