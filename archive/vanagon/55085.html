Subject: '86-up Water Pumps $42.50 (2 avail)

I'm stuck with two new Vanagon water pumps (OEM German) that I ordered for 
a potential customer, and as it turns out, do not need.  These fit '86-up 
Vanagons (and list for $216.00, not that anyone actually pays list).    
Would sell for $42.50 each plus UPS shipping. Any takers?
