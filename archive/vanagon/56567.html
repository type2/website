&lt;&lt; I'm thinking of installing a sunroof in the top of my 81 Westy.  Has
anyone
 had much experience with this?  Would this be an easy job to do myself and
 are there many problems, such as leaking, ect.  Thanks for any comments
 concerning this. &gt;&gt;

I don't know how much you want to spend, but theyre's a company out in AZ
called Street Beat that makes sliding (microbus style) ragtop sunroofs in any
size you want. Pricey, but they look cool....
