Subject: muffler repair story

&gt;&gt; they left off a few gaskets) it would amount to a grand total
&gt;&gt; of $1810.89 FOR PARTS ALONE!  Is it just me or
&gt;&gt; DOTHESEBACKBITINGASSHOLESREALLYPISSYOUOFF!!!!!!!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;        Try Midas.
&gt;
&gt;        I was responding to your msg. when it occured to me I'd like to have an
&gt;        idea of costs for mine. So, I called Midas.
&gt;
&gt;        Muffler =       $185
&gt;        Cat.=           $160
&gt;        Install=        $ 12
&gt;
&gt;        Plus any pipes.
&gt;
&gt;        The main reason I'd do Midas is because of the lifetime-we'll-replace-
&gt;        any-parts thing. Meinike also, I think.
&gt;

I went in for an estimate from Midas a few years ago and was shocked at the
final total. I drove off disappointed and on a whim stopped at the local
brake and muffler shop, just the local mechanic. He put the car on the lift
and before I told him anything he said, &quot;yep, you need a piece of pipe
welded in here for sure. Now, hold on, this might cost you. It'll probably
be about $15!&quot;
15 minutes later I drove out literally a happy camper. Midas was prepared
to charge me for the whole muffler, pipes and labor. I'm sure not all Midas
places are like this, but when you work on cars like MacDonalds sells
food...
Admitedly, I should have investigated the muffler myself, but I was young
and foolish. 
Moral: find someone you can trust. And be informed.
