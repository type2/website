     Bill,
     
     It solves the problem of your PO being too lazy to fix the broken 
     cable that shuts off the fresh air vents inside the cab of the van.
     
     You will probably notice that your vent controls don't seem to work 
     right (or you can't figure out how they work at all).
     
     Check the archives for more discussion.

I just removed the grill on my '84 westy and found that the PO had 
covered what appears to be the fresh air intake with duct tape.  I 
remember seeing some mention of this on the list.  What problem is this 
supposed to solve?
