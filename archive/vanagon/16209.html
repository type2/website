Subject: Re: conversions

&gt;Has anyone had or know of the 
&gt;costs and pains of converting a bus (esp 71 and before) to a westy 
&gt;camper, either one that's already a camper to a pop-top, or a transporter 
&gt;to a camper?  Can some of the work be done at home or must all of it be 
&gt;done at a shop? 
&gt; Erik

I've fitted a couple of pop-tops to bay-window buses. I've already sent out 
a long-winded description to the list a couple of times so to avoid 
repeating it all again I'll send it direct to you. And if anyone wants a 
dtailed account of the skinned knuckles/back strain/cold sweat you get when 
about to cut a huge hole in your bus, then just ask.
