Subject:      GNATT, and misc.

The busses by the arch being worked in is a good move. I haven't yet notified
anyone but I hope to join in parts of the GNATT in the east (will be at BBA).


My problem is that since the group traffic expanded exponentially, I haven't
been able to read 10% of the msgs since December! This traffic screams for a
newsgroup gateway. The notions before that too much traffic would result is
now moot. I like the group, the info and the effort but simply can't read 50+
messages a day w/o being able to sort, see headers, etc. The freedom for many
of us would be dramatically increased. I know folks on rec.autos.vw who can't
join here due to the traffic and inability to maipulate the msgs as one can in
a newsgroup. A gateway would help but if it can't be accomplished, I too may
have to either leave or plod on with the hit and miss reading 10% of what
happens here. Even using this method, it's hard to follow threads. I really
appreciate the efforts of Gerry and everyone else. I am one of the group that
has found it hard to stay with it. Digests aren't really an option for some of
us because it still does not allow much flexibility. Anyway, I say all this to
note that others like myself may have interest in GNATT but can't follow the
thread. I'll at least be at BBA. BTW, I may be looking at putting in a 3
window canvas. Anyone know what's involved and whether its a couple hour
project?
