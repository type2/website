&gt;Can someone please tell me the price and source for these, if a non-VW 
&gt;supplier exists?.  $190Cdn each for rotors that look identical to all 
&gt;breadloaf rotors is a bit high. 
_____________________________________________________________

I paid around $US 45 each for sychro ('90) rotors about a year ago.  My 
total (front axle) brake job cost about US$120; US$90 for 2 rotors, 
remainder for the premium pads specified for this application.  My supplier 
is &quot;AV Brake Supply&quot;, and they can be reached at 805/942-6461.  I suspect 
they would mail order.....check it out.
