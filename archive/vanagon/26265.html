&gt;We had some drenching rain the past couple of days here in Connecticut.  I
&gt;have a similiar leak on the left side of my 87' Syncro.  I replaced the
&gt;rubber seal approximately 6 months ago.  It seemed to work for a while but
&gt;its beginning to leak again.  Can water enter the inside of the van through
&gt;the fresh air vent??  Anyone else experience a similiar problem to ours??  I
&gt;don't think its coming from the windshield seal.

another place to check is the pivot point of the vent window on the doors.
my driver's side leaked in heavy rains, so i got some black silicon seal
and put a &quot;dab&quot; on the outside, where the glass and the pivot point met the
rubber. it's held now for 7 years. don't go getting &quot;gobby&quot; with it ... it
only takes a very little to plug the hole.
