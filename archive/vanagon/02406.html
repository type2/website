&gt;when importing these things into the u.s., our Friendly Federal Government,
&gt;in its unceasing effort to protect its Citizens from Themselves, and, at the
&gt;same time, protect its auto-makers from the Hordes of Volkswagen Trucks that
&gt;would descend upon these shores, will slap a twenty-five percent import tax
&gt;on that sucker! 25 percent!

What happened to the Canada/U.S. Free Trade Agreement?  The duties on
importing vehicles to Canada from the U.S. have been greatly reduced lately.
This must have something to do with the vans being German made, not U.S. or
Canada...
