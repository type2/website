Subject: curtains for 89 vanagon

hey, how hard is it to put in curtains in a Vanagon? I know campers 
get 'em but  I'd like em in my non-campmobile; if &amp; when I hit Vegas 
i dont bother with a hotel, I just unfold the back seat and 
voila!(god i LOVE my vanagon!!) And would anyone have a curtain set 
w/ hardware that I can purchase?  Gotta match either the grey 
interior! 

Thanks guys!!       Buslady &amp; thy Vanagon(NEEDS A NAME! suggestions?)
