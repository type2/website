Dan,  I, too,  thought of using the propane torch, but have so far refrained 
from it for fear of damaging/burning anything. But your suggestion now 
encourages me to try after all. Unless, of course, somebody on the list 
comes up with a good reason for why this should not be done.

&gt; maybe your fridge just needs the proper sacrifice and blood-letting.  
&gt; try gashing your hand on that turned up piece sheet-metal the PO

I like to employ other, weaker, beings for my ritual sacrifices &lt;&quot;Here, 
kittycat, come here...&quot;&gt;  :-)
