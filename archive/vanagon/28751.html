Subject:       Re: East Coast Inuvik alternatives

I like it!  I was stressing about how to get together the funds to 
drive all the way to B.C. before even going to inivuk from S.E. mich. 
Why not head straight north through Mich.  across the Macinac bridge, 
through the U.P. Across the blue water and on to some northern 
destination in canada.   Please don't make me drive south.  I would 
have to go through Ohio.  Anyway, I hear there are some incredible 
parks up that way. Or, (to the sesamie street theme music) can you 
tell me how to get.... how to get to churchill?
Just some ideas.  Le'me know.  I wanna travel.
Ed.
