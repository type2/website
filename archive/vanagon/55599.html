&gt; Hello Tony,
&gt; 		I hope Dave Tomassetti at Motronix Motorsport was of help to you.  If
&gt; not, I will look at your ECU if you can not find someone in your area. 
&gt; Since the problem is in the ECU, its worth looking at.  I will look at
&gt; it for no charge and tell you what I found if you pay the shipping both
&gt; ways.  If it is repairable, I will fix it (if you want it fixed) at a
&gt; very reasonable price.  (I usually charge a fixed fee of $250 CDN ) so
&gt; it would be around $200 US.
&gt; 
&gt; Hopefully you can find someone in your area to fix it.  I will be out of
&gt; Canada  (going to Cancun) from 8 Feb until 16 Feb.  so I will not anser
&gt; any e-mail sent during that period.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; 	Mark D'Sylva
