Subject: FS- Hard to find parts for Bugs, Busses, and Ghias

 I recently purchased a convertible Ghia project, so I ,once again,
am trying to sell some of my extra parts. I have owned at least 25
Vintage VW's over the years and have lots of extra parts for Bugs,
Busses, and Ghias. Please help a fellow aircooled addict out, all of
the parts are original, German parts, fairly priced and guaranteed.
Please E-mail if interested. Brian
