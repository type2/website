So Cetin Seren says:
&gt; place, and checked the oil level once again, almost full -- BTW, what
&gt; was that smell??? Then I slapped myself on the head: the oil smelled
&gt; of gasoline!!!! Somehow, it mixed in (the fact that the van idles high
&gt; until it warms up? the few times I cranked it too long and flooded it?
&gt; the fact that the engine now has 142,000 miles on it? some other
&gt; defect  somewhere else that I cannot think of?).  In any case, the
&gt; buzzer and the light were coming on because the oil was thinned down
&gt; by the gasoline that somehow mixed in.
&gt; Anyways, the 'cure' was an oil change with 20W50 oil...  I've been
&gt; 'sniffing' the oil reasonably frequently now, and no smell of gasoline
&gt; yet. 

Hi Cetin,

It sounds like your fuel injectors are probably worn and that the fuel 
is leaking past their seals/valve.  I would consider replacing them.  Check 
them first of course.
