&gt; Perhaps, I just don't know how use the propane fill valve on the '87 syncro I

&gt; I've had 10 filling stations attempt to charge my tank to no avail. The
&gt; propane just won't
&gt; go in. The red re-set button won't move in or out, and I suspect the re-set
&gt; button is not re-setting. I've squirted WD40 into the valve to attempt to
&gt; free the re-set button I think is frozen. I've spun the re-set with plyers.
&gt; Does anyone know how I can get my tank filled? I'd love to avoid buying a new
&gt; valve for the $300 the dealer wants.

Mine doesn't have a reset button, but to the right (rearwards) of the 
filler attachment, their is a small bleeder knob. Apparently on most 
car systems which use this type of filler, the bleeder only needs to 
be opened a bit. The first time I tried it the thing too $.20 worth 
of gas &amp; stopped. I told the guy to try opening the knob all the way -
this did the trick. It then took about 11 litres worth of gas (tank 
was right empty at the time.)
