Patrick,

Oh, isn't Yosemite Yellow a grand color! :) With the color code in hand, I
went to an All-Pro auto parts store, but any store that carries automotive
Du Pont paint should be able to help. Du Pont has an 800 number (call
1-800-555-1212 to find it) and they will refer you to the closest store. 
I am not implying, however, that Du Pont is the only possible brand; I
suppose the VW factory was supplied by German paint manufacturer such as
BASF, or Henckel, or whatever. 

The color I got might have been a perfect match when the bus was new, but
not after 20 years. A mild grinding compound will remove the upper layer
of oxidized paint, though.

Hope this helps, 

Sami

PS: Patrick, your return address doesn't seem to work. Please let me know
