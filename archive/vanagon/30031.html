Subject: Re: Vanagon snow performance

Vanagons rule the roads when there is fresh snow!  I get to payback all
the yuppies in their Miatas.  I try to stay under the speed limit on the
highway when there is a fresh snow.  I would hate to cause an accident by
forcing some &quot;friendly local&quot; police type to have an accident trying to
chase me down in a caprice or an LTD.  Snowtires?  I drove all winter with
a half bald tire (like from a bad alignment).  Never a problem.  I even
pulled a Caprice Classic out of the snow once.  To summarize vanagons are
kings of snowy roads.  Syncros must be Gods...

&gt; Since this is my first winter with my Vanagon, I would like to know
&gt; what to expect as far as traction and the like when it starts to
&gt; snow.  I will buy some snow tires, so can I get away with only two
&gt; rears, or do I need all four tires to be stable?  I have been told
&gt; that the Vanagons are actually quite good in the snow.  Your
&gt; opinions?
