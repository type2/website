Here in BC they have an add running for Mohawk Oil (a company that prides
itself on being the environemntal choice).  It has 4 or 5 people pushing
this orange and white bus (sorry don't know what year it is) past a gas
station to the bemusement of the gas jockey.  They keep pushing it down this
deserted desert-like highway until they get to the Mohawk station.
