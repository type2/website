the 82/84/85 vanagons! sneaking up from behind ... who knows what may
happen by the end of the summer. :)

and, for those geographically-impaired members among us, here's where
we all are.  kinda lonely down here in west alabama. :( not even one
other buser in alabama or mississippi (well,he said snobbily, i sorta
didn't really expect any THERE ...) ;)  sigh.

the beach-bums of the golden surf are still waaaaaay out in front
(must be all that nice weather than makes 'em like buses ... or the
ability to move everything they own in case of a) earthquake,
b) mudslide, c) brushfire, d) mudslide putting out brushfire. all WE
ever get is bugs, floods, hurricanes,and tornados!).

but the lone-star texans are slowly gaining on 'em! and our neighbors
to the north (should i break you guys up into provinces?) are also
gaining ground.

well, time to go visit my local FLAPS (they feel neglected if i don't
come by once a week or so). :)  hope everybody has a good weekend.
