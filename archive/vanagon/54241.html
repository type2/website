Vanagoners:

	This relates to the discussions about importing vehicles, mostly buses
from Canada. I saw two brand new Mexican beetles today in Loxley, AL ( 10
miles east of Mobile.) 
	From various lists I have been led to believe that it can't be done, but
there they were! The &quot;dealer&quot; said he got them approved for CA, so they
should be good for everywhere. They had AL plates on both of them. One was
the City model and the other the Classico (asking 10,995 and 11,700
respectively.) 
	If he can get beetles, how about buses? What's available in Mexico? I'm
not sure just where this post belongs; vintagvw? but they're certainly NOT
vintage. and they're not water pumpers...
	What should I ask to see to make sure that they're legit?
