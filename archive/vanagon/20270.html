Subject: RE: Keeping it cool, simple


_______________________________________________________________________________
Problem: Family going camping in East Texas over July 4th in '73 Campmobile 
wants to keep from melting during sleeptime at night.  Lots of pressure for 
cool air on bus owner by family members.

Solution: Purchased a used 5000 btu window unit air conditioner ($95), built 
small box which is duct-taped to cool air vent on a/c unit.  Took 2 dryer 
vent hoses and using proper sized pinapple cans with both ends cut out, 
duct-taped the hose/can assembly to the box unit on the a/c.  Ran dryer 
hoses into side vent window opening of bus, using cardboard (or 1/4&quot; 
plywood) cut to fit and seal vent window openings, with holes to fit dryer 
hoses.  Everybody cool and happy!

  ok, so you have to find someplace with power and plug the thing in?
  is that what the plan is???
