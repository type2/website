Subject: Re: CV Boots/Bolts Question

&gt;hiya friends,
&gt;
&gt;i just got an excellent deal on a 1974 Vw Bus with a rebuilt engine...for $300
&gt;from my roomate...excellent shape. i'm psyched, it's my first vw. there are a
&gt;few things that need to be done....right now i'm working on the cv boots.
&gt;
&gt;at least one is cracked...and i was going to replace the others since i'd be
&gt;doing one anyways. yesterday i got the inner and outter cv joint from the right
&gt;rear side off. now i've got a couple of questions.
&gt;
&gt;1) I can get the boots themselves for $9.00 from an auto parts store. or i can
&gt;get a 'kit' with the clamps, bolts (tho i don't know why they would give me
&gt;bolts), one boot and the grease needed. this doesn't seem like a deal for
&gt;$18.95. should i replace the bolts to the cv joint itself if they look okay?
&gt;should i go for getting just the boots, using grease i already have, and trying
&gt;to use the clamps from the old joint?
&gt;
&gt;2) The right rear joint came off easy. not so on the other side. i've got two
&gt;#$%_at_!&amp;! bolts that seem to be frozen. i was straining on one and kind of
&gt;stripped the head of one bolt...the head is still there but the ratchet doesn't
&gt;fit anymore. then i tried with some vise grips. no give. then i tried
&gt;saturating it with WD40. no give. any suggestions? i'm guessing if i can't get
&gt;it off, i'm going to have to put all the other bolts back on take the van to
&gt;a shop or something.
&gt;
&gt;is there any other way to clean up the ball barings and the cv joint itself
&gt;without using gasoline? i don't have a great way of disposing gasoline...
&gt;
&gt;thanks for putting up with my rambling here....

Johnatan,

I've run into the same problem on my '79 bus.  I replaced two boots with one
made in Brazil, the other made in India.  Thay both cracked within a few
months.  They're crap.  Buy only the GERMAN one-piece boots.  They'll last
for years.  If you use the cheap boots you'll end up having to do the whole
filthy job again within a few months to a year.

Regarding getting the stuck/stripped CV bolts out:  I used high-quality,
large, U.S. made Vice-Grips.  You gotta clamp on real tight and push/pull
like a MF to get them to start.  I think I used Knockerloose on them and let
'em soak for a while first.  You may have to resort to a propane or butane
torch to help loosen them (like shock absorber bolts).  After you've
bloodied your knuckles and used almost every cuss word in your vocabulary,
they should come loose.

Of course, you've got to thoroughly clean the balls and cages with naptha or
some other solvent.  If you want to get rid of the used solvent, you can
either let the crap settle in it and siphon off the clear solvent for reuse
or pour it into a metal pan and set it on fire (outdoors is best for this).
Inspect the balls and cages for worn/blue spots.  If not too bad, you may
get another 20K miles or more out of them.  Use CV joint grease only.  It's
usually included with a kit or you can buy a whole tube.

Have fun,


Cheese
