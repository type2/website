Subject:      Repair parts?

Hi, I'm new to this forum, but I find it interesting. I purchased a 1989 =
Wolfsburg new and service in Illinois has been difficult. I need to find =
a source of aftermarket parts. Can anyone help? Right now I am in dire =
need of a complete exhaust. I checked the dealer and it would be cheaper =
to have a local machine shop build a custom one from stainless steel!=20
