Subject: Update on engine installation: MT has 2 again
Date: Wed, 3 May 1995 11:28:27 -0600 (MDT)

Hello Vanagon List Members,
Here is a late breaking update on my engine installation.  You may recall
in previous episodes that the explosion of my engine on Bozeman Pass was
preserved in one of Will Self's stories.  My new engine has now been
installed and it is running very well.  Yesterday I was able to run it
about 300 miles and it performed flawlessly.

However, I now have a question.  I was allowed to keep my fuel pump
(it is a diesel engine) and I want to know:  How does one keep an unused
fuel pump in storage?  I think that I want to place it in a large covered
container of automatic transmission fluid, but maybe someone on the list
has a better idea.  I also have my water pump which I need to store and
I think that transmission fluid may work there also.  However, I need
advice from the list about this.  Has anyone successfully stored their
fuel pump?
