This is a copy of reply I have sent to several people on this subject. 
Hope it is some help.

'85 Westy,   &quot;S-CAPE&quot;

What we had to do was take the tank off, sand it all down, remove the ID
&gt; plate so to see that it isn't rotted through underneath.  I guess this is
a
&gt; common problem because there is enough room under the label for dirt and
&gt; moisture to get in and not get out again.  Resecure the ID plate, for
this
&gt; we used an epoxy-steel weld cement, &amp; repaint the tank. The fill valve on
&gt; ours was all coroded.  The valve that was on it originally had a little
&gt; tube coming off of it.  This is for the overflow.  They only fill the
tank
&gt; part way with the liquid propane and  this valve allows for any excess
&gt; overfill to vent out.  This is were the problem lies.  They don't make
this
&gt; valve anymore from what I can find out.  What our propane guy did was to
&gt; put a regular fill valve on it, just like you would have on a 20 gas
grille&gt; bottle.  Then in the upper part of the (when looking at it on its
side)
&gt; tank there is a little square.  As I recall, it was about 5/8th of an
inch
&gt; square.  In this place he put in what he called a &quot;spitter&quot; valve which
&gt; takes the place of the original overflow/excess valve.  Then they
pressure
&gt; tested the bottle and stamped it with the date. We reinstalled it and he
&gt; filled it.  It's perfect!  So, don't give up if it looks like a rusty old
&gt; torpedo from WW II.  (of course, that's exactly what they MAY be).
