Thanks Chris!

To the list: To clarify, the damage was done prior to painting. There is no
body damage other than some very minor dings and such on the van now.

Sorry for any confusion,

tony

btw - I'm in Cincinnati, OH. Boy, did I botch the ad up or what! :-)

&gt; &gt;'96, no rust, only body work done is a small spot behind the sliding
door,
&gt; &gt;looks like a short pole was swiped.
&gt; 
&gt; Tony,  just want to bring this to your attention - It kinda reads as if
there
&gt; was still body damage....
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; just an observation...
