Subject: Automatic or stick?

Another question for the experts out there.  Living in DC &quot;can&quot; mean tons of 
traffic.  I have an automatic now (hate to admit it, but not a VW) and love 
the convenience.  I used to have a '72 Bug (in high school) and got 
experienced real quick with shifting a few thousand times an hour.  So, 
given this, I'd love an automatic. UNLESS 70's auto trans have proven to be 
a nightmare in the buses.  Opinions??????
