Subject: Re: searching for potable water pump

&gt;We just got an '85 westy and have found that the potable water pump has
&gt;been frozen so as not to be usable any more.  Does anyone know where one
&gt;can be found?  Thanks in advance!!

Back in my younger days, I used a motor from 12v windsheild washer motor to
make the spigot in my '70 bus electric/push button. I just added the pump
in-line and ran the wiring to a push-button switch. The pump in the '70
still worked, I just found it inconvenient to use while driving...and back
then I was *marathon man*...1050 miles in 24 hours was my normal solo trip.
Times have changed; now I don't mind stopping to get some water *or* sleep.
