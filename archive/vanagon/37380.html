&gt;  Patrick headed back to Baltimore with the &quot;door prize&quot;.  His crew cab
&gt;     looks great,but the prior owner did a poor job of repairing bullet
&gt;     damage on the drivers side, and now Patrick can replace it with the
&gt;     door from the DOA Syncro - even the color is correct!
&gt;
&gt;

MUST..... FIND..... CREWCAB!.... SPOCK!  HELP ME!..... Wait!  There's one on
my screen.  Who does it belong to?  Patrick Eagan?  Well..... Patrick, if
your out there reading, I would love to see pictures and/or diagrams of the
elusive Crewcab Transporter.  I need to see how the body in the rear half
differs from the normal Vanagon body.  Did they offer a watercooled version?
 I would love to see pictures of the interior and such.
