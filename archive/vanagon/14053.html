I don't know if it is the rear hatch screen you want, if so then maybe this 
will help. We bought about 4 yards of 36&quot; wide ultra-fine bug netting from a 
camping store. Stitched it into a big square the size of the rear hatch 
opening, then cut it to fit + 2&quot; hem. Stitched the hem over with some nylon 
covered elastic shock cord. Voila.. the largest hair net on earth, just slip 
it over the inside rim of the rear hatch. Stows away in a very small bag 
too.    tim s.
