Subject: Carrying a canoe, Was: Re: Rain Gutter Adapter Locations
Date: Sat, 28 Jun 97 12:44:53 EDT

For &quot;absolutely-no-drilling&quot; types you can carry a canoe on your
pop top Westy by tying it in the front and back and using canoe
carrying foam blocks. The blocks attach to the rim of the canoe.

So where to tie it in the back you may ask? The answer is: the rear
hatch. With the hatch open loop a line around each of the hinges.
Tie down the canoe rear between the hinges. (In the front use
the Westy luggage rack tiedowns of course)

About pop top mounted racks: I'm sceptic to mounting false
gutters on the front of the pop top. Consider that the only thing
holding the top down in the front on the late Westy's is the
center latch. Forces applied to the side of the top is going to
cause considerable bending tensions on the top.

However I do like the idea of having a rack wich allows the
pop to be popped even with a light load on. I have a design worked 
out where the side of the top is locked down to the gutter when
in transporting mode. Now I just need some time to go down to
the machine shop and make it.
