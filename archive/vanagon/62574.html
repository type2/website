Subject: Re: Thule roof racks for Westie-Help?

Having once worked at REI selling racks, among other toys, I would opt for
the Yakima. Yakima cross bars are somewhat stronger than the Thule bars, from
what I saw. Also the Yakima bars are round in profile, so if you have
accesories like a ski carrier, you can loosen the clamps and fold the
carriers down, when not in use, for less wind resistance(probably a moot
point on the highly arodynamic Vanagon). Parts and accesories also seem to be
more available, better made, easily understood. I have the gutter mount 1A
towers with 77 inch wide bars on my Syncro 7 passenger, I can strap on a
bunch of stuff up there!
I'm noy sure what Thule part numbers go onto Westies, but Yakima does make
bolt on rain gutters, you drill, bolt and mount onto your pop top or truck
cap or whatever. Even though they come with rubber gaskets, I would insure it
was well sealed by gooping up the drilled holes with silicone eam sealer.
