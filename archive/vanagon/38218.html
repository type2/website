the panels are drying- theyll get three coats of
&gt;varnish.  The front door panels got Thompson's water seal on the backside
&gt;too.
&gt;

I'd suggest an oil based polyurethane that contains UV filters. It's self
leveling and dries in three hours. It'll last a lot longer than varnish,
and is heaps easier to apply/repair.

Thompson's water seal is NOT a very good product, and is much more toxic
than either varnish or polyurethane. A general rule of woodworking,
especially when dealing with thin veneers, is to do the same treatment to
both sides of the material. Over time, and given the wild temperature
fluctuations of a car interior, you WILL have movement problems (read:
cracking) with differing treatments.

I'd also suggest you seal the plywood before you varnish or urethane it.
This is done easily with a wash coat of 3 parts denatured alcohol and 1
part shellac.
