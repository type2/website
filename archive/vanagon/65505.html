Fellow Listees,
After having had my van back in my possession for one week, I have put
about 300miles on it and have found some interesting things about it. I've
really been elated with the performance with the temporary intake filter
and hoses. I now have all the guages ready to install. One in particular
kept nagging at me to be installed...The vacuum gauge. Even though the
hoses and filter were temporary, I decided to drill and tap the hose about
midway between the turbo and the filter...I wasn't to shocked to see 15 in.
of vacuum _at_ 2000rpm, no load. I figgured the very small (4 by6 in.)  K&amp;N
filter was the problem. After removing the filter, I still had 15in vac
_at_2000 rpm. Now istarted to worry.
The very small KKK turbo on this engine has an opening of 1 3/4 in OD,
about 1 5/8&quot; ID. I used a 1 3/4&quot; ID hose throughout. We're talking about
15&quot; overall with 2- 90 deg angles. I called a VW rep I know and asked what
they're using. Turns out they use 2 3/8&quot; hose to the filter. No problem, I
can do that... Well to make a long story a touch more interesting, I didn't
have any of the pieces of larger hose at the ready so... I pulled the whole
shootin match off and took it for a spin ( sans air filter)(which I
normally wouldn't do, period). Well, while the governor kicked in at the
same spot, it took a whole lot less time to get there... I thought this
thing was quick before,but, as soon as I get everything in place, I'm going
to go find me a late model 7 passenger to race...I can't wait...Mexican
busses won't be passing me anymore...
Much Later,
