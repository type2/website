&gt; &gt; Greetings,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Just purchased my first vanagon, an 87 westie synchro.  I Have a few
&gt; &gt; questions:
&gt; 
&gt; Congratulations!!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt; &gt; 3.  Where can I find the EPA emissions label?  I bought it out of CA
&gt; &gt;     (where i live) and am trying to find if it was ever certified for CA
&gt; &gt;     emissions (will save me $300).
&gt; 
&gt; Pull down the rear license plate door (where, conveniently, you can
&gt; check/add coolant and oil).  The sticker should be there.  And, I
&gt; believe I read somewhere that all 87's met CA EPA stuff and said so on
&gt; the label (I know mine does and it's lived it's whole life in
&gt; Louisiana).

As I understood it, VW was producing a Federal car (Fed Smog Rules) and
a California car circa 1987. This should be fairly easy to verify with a
VW dealer. Nearly all cars today are built to CAL EPA requirements as
other states are adopting the CAL EPA std., but they have been doing so
in phases and at different times by manufacturer.
