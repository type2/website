I can't believe that I'm coming to the EuroVan's defense, but...:)

While the rated hp is around 108, it puts out 170-180 ft-lbs of torque.
Thats not far off what the VR6 produces. It is this torque (which is
produced at reasonable rpms) that, in my opinion, gives the van the hwy
cruising qualities that Bill and Ric enthuise about.

Its been said before but it bears repeating :

	&quot;horsepower sells cars, torque wins races&quot;

Well, actually, I think reliability wins a good share of races too ;)

Alistair, bravely wading into the hp vs torque tarpit
