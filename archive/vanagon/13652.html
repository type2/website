Subject: Re: washer nozzle

The following worked well on the rear window washer on my 82 accord.  The
washer had been plugged for eons.  Eventually I got fed up.  I disconnected
the hose leading to the nozzle from the fluid reservoir (easy to get to)
and stuffed it into the end of a high pressure bicycle pump.  At about 60
psi a wad of dirt came flying out of the nozzle and everybody lived happily
after.  Any source of compressed air would probably work.


&gt;Has anyone removed the windshield washer nozzle on a vanagon? One of ours
&gt;is plugged and it needs to be cleaned from the inside out....TIA - DC
