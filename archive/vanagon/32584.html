Subject: re:  secret rituals


Someone wrote:

something about &quot;the nightly dateline news featuring 2 VW busses/vans
in a head on collision because neither driver had both hands on the
wheel....yada, blah, etc.&quot;

To which it suddenly occured to me to respond:  ok, well then, guys, how's
about changing the secret handshake to just one hand and just one finger.
The middle one maybe?   :)
