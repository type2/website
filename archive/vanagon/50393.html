Subject: Migrating Mirrors - help!!

Volks Folks,

When we purchased our Vanagon a few months ago noticed how the passenger side
mirror would slowly head south.  It keeps its adjustment about the X &amp; Y axis
but loses altitude on the Z axis.  Every couple hundred miles you have to get
out and pull the mirror back from its drooping position.  The drivers side
mirror is another story.  On a trip to Colorado we noticed that the mirror
doubles as a 75 mph indicator.  When you hit 75mph the mirror folds back
against the door.

We could live with these annoyances except for the fact that our 75mph
indicator has become a 70mph indicator.  I think it is time to do something
before it becomes a 50mph indicator.

Anyway, if anyone out there has any sugesstions on how to fix these mirrors
-or- if anyone has a pair of Vanagon electric mirrors with all the controls,
please drop me a line and let me know.

Thanks,
Dan
