Ok, my '71 camper is off white except the front is primer from a PO.  
There is a beautiful shiny patch on the top of the drivers door 
created my dad in an attempt to get me to polish the whole thing.  I 
decided against it because of the huge orangish/red stripe surrounding
the lower 10% of the bus.  Nothing hanging from the mirror.  After I 
purchased it I did find part of a bottle of Jim Beam in the glove box.  
Took care of that in short order, much to the horror of my girlfriend. 
She was under the mistaken impression that it could somehow spoil. :)

Oh, and it is currently drapeless.  The originals were quite rotten so
I shipped them to my sister as parterns for some new ones.  I have 
trusted the fabric color to her good taste.  I still have not seen 
them.  If anyone happens to be near the pharamacy at the downtown 
Safeway in Portland please ask Jodi that she step up the work on her 
brother's drapes.  He is getting tired of getting dressed in front of 
god and everybody at the local state park.
