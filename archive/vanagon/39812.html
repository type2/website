Subject: westy pop canvas source

Hey there!
I was able to purchase a repop canvas from:

Rex Eastman
941 Hansen Avenue
Merced, CA 95340
(209) 384-1910

The canvas is nice the windows and screens are well constructed and the cost
runs around $125.00. The color is OK but is not the stock goldenrod
orangey-yellow that the anal purist would wish for. The color though is a
perfectly acceptible slightly darker than khaki color.

Definitely call to confirm availability of the canvas. He also is well known
on the west coast for selling used shop shirts and overalls with &quot;VW
Service&quot; silkscreened on the back of them.

Rex has been known to advertise in the NEATO newsletter.
