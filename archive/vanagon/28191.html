Subject: I finally did it

All,

This morning I finally did what I wanted to do - shine the hub caps on
my new Westy.
They turned out pretty nice with a minimum of work (wipe the dirt off)
When I got the Westy I thought I was going to have to purchase new hub
caps that were shiny, saved me a few $$$.

Oh, yeah  I also put the engine in, and hooked up odds &amp; ends.
It got rather frustrating though, My wife and I were struggling with
getting the studs in the case to slide into the holes in the trans
bellhousing (we struggled for about 45 minutes!). She then went inside
to check on our daughter, and the moment she went inside, &quot;click&quot;,
the clutch, and trans shaft lined up, and bolts slid in the holes like
nobody's business. I guess if I did the whole thing by myself, instead
of getting help, I would have had the engine up in no time at all,
instead of an hour.  Not too shabby for my first time though, IMHO.

Tomorrow morning I finish shining the hub caps, maybe Armor All the
tires, change the oil. Oh yeah, I have to finish bolting everything to
the engine, and fire it up(hopefully). I did notice a few extra bolts
though (rather large ones too ;-))

Cheers,

David
74 Thing (next weeks engine out project)
79 Westy (maybe I'll be driving it tomorrow)
