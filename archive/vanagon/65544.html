Subject:      Aux. Battery Isolator Relay

I am in the process of installing an auxillary battery. I have read all I=

can find in the archives, but still have some confusion on how to hook up=

the isolator relay. The relay I purchased has four terminals but the
diagram shows one switching terminal goes to ground and one to the igniti=
on
switch. I had read in the archives that I could jump terminals 85 and 86 =
of
the refrigerator relay to the switching terminals of the new cut off rela=
y,
but this seems to differ from the wiring diagram that came with the relay=
=2E
Should I connect the ground terminal to ground or to termnial 86 of the
refrigerator relay (which I believe goes to the alternator)?
