I believe, at least for the US market, the 30 PICT-1 was used
for the non-emission controlled 1500 engined Typ1 and Typ2
vehicles. The 30 PICT-2s were used on the emission controlled
Typ1 and Typ2s equipped with 1500s from 68 &amp; 69. According
to the 1970 Clymer Owner's Handbook of Maintenance and
Repair (12 ed), the 30 PICT-3 was used on the 1970 emission
controlled 1600 engines in the Typ1 and Typ2s.

Hope this helps.
