&gt;Here my question: can anybody tell me what the normal and the maximum 
&gt;reading should be (the gauge is in Fahrenheit - unfortunately!).

I don't think there is one *correct* reading. Gauge calibration is often
poor. Moreover, there will be differences depending on where the sender is
located. Try to observe the readings after a good tune-up and under
various loads and you'll get your personal range. After that, just watch
for outliers.

&gt;Another question: I tried to unscrew the transmission fluid inspection 
&gt;and refill plug - with my limited equipment without any success. Does 
&gt;anybody have another idea besides the garage around the corner...
&gt;
I tried using the trick with the 17mm nut, but I bruised a knuckle. Then I
got the 17mm Allen wrench from Sears (about $10) and used my foot for more
torque.
