I'm a member.  The 15% off parts counter coupon saved me something like
$350 on the factory rebuilt 2.1 that I just bought.  Just used the $24.95
front end alignment coupon.  And the 15% off any A/C repair will probably
be used next. Definately worth my $25!  Almost as good a deal as the
Vanagon list for $5:).

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone joined the Volkswagen Club from VW? They offer a whole bunch
&gt; of benefits that seem like it might be worth the $25. The parts discount
&gt; is the one that stands out the most (even thought I hardly ever buy
&gt; parts from the dealer) Any thoughts/experiences?
&gt;
