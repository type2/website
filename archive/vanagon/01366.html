Subject: Re: engine substitutions


I have a catalog from Kennedy Engineering, and they suggest that there 
are a shitload of engine swaps one can make.  They say that the Subaru 
1800 engine is a terrific fit, and it is smooth and quiet.  Obviously 
some modifications would need to be attended to, but I have seriously 
thought of making the swap as soon as the stock 1600 grinder I have in my 
camper finally gives way.

Seeing that I just rebuilt it and it runs well (pat on the back), 
I hope I don't need to consider this for, oh, 50 thousand miles or so. :)
