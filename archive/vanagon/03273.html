&gt; On our trip, we waved at all of the VW Bricks we saw.  The number of friendly
&gt; return waves was dismally low.  I really thought I'd get a better response. 
&gt; Maybe it's because our van is brown (&quot;Taupe&quot; actually &lt;grin&gt;).

Sorry, I would have waved, but I had a soda in one hand and a jay in
the other. HAHA.

Next time I'll be ready when I see that Taupe box coming.
