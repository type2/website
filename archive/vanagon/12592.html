That's a fun topic, so I'll chime in. I've been thinking about doing the
same, except that in MO, we're limited to 6 characters. (Then again, it's
only $15, i.e., still $2.50 per character:).)

I would stay away from redundancies, e.g. MYMIATA on a Miata, or
BMW525I on a beemer. Similarly, MYBUS on a bus is not very informative.

Those are my present candidates. Lemme know what you think:
NC-1701		guess what shows I watch...
D-OHH		ditto
ICE-BOX		especially in the winter
AH-LECK		for the German tailgater
PROZAC		because driving my bus makes me HAPPY!
