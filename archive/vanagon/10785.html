&gt; Hi all-
 
&gt; 1) to the right of the spedo, there is a dummy gauge, was there a factory 
&gt; option gauge for this hole?

Yes.  The clock.  'ol dad had one on his '71 sq.back--didn't work in '75, 
already!
I'm thinking of putting a tachometer in there, just for kicks.  

&gt; 
&gt; 2) Just under the said gauge hole, there is a red light thingy with a &quot;B&quot; on 
&gt; it.  Anyone know what this is?
Well, that would be your &quot;brake warning test light,&quot; a rather humorous 
device which will simply tell you whether (or not) your &quot;brake warning 
light&quot; works.  If your master cylinder fails (yikes!), this sucker is 
supposed to light up.  Fun to test on occasion, just to see if it works.  

&gt; 3) I found out that I have a frozen heater cable on the right side.  Any 
&gt; ideas short of replacing it?
If beyond any hopes of a good &quot;liquid wrench&quot; dousing, I would guess a 
junk-yard salvage.
