What you saw was indeed a Eurovan single cab.  We have them up here in 
Canada, and they're fairly common.  VW also makes a double cab version.  
I don't know what the restrictions would be importing one into the US, 
but doesn't David Schwarze have a link to a Canadian VW Dealership off of 
his web site at http://www.teleport_dot_com/~des/vw ?
