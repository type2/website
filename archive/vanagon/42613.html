TF&gt;It makes me wonder, what is the longest life listmembers can report
TF&gt;for a wasserboxer? What is typical?

TF&gt;Tom F.

Talked to a guy once I stopped in a parking lot, 228k on a '87 syncro
never had a problem, never changed the coolant or the tranny oil, only
thing he had ever done was change the engine oil.  He lived out some
back mountain WV roads and beat the thing pretty heavily.  He did
replace the power steering rack at 150k though.

Conversely my '85 had the heads replaced at 65k only has 75k on it
today.  Our old '86 had slightly pitted heads at 60k which vw
glassbeaded
and replaced the head gaskets on as part of the ole &quot;secret almost
recall&quot;
of the early 90's.

No real rhime or reason IMHO but again all corrosion is electrical in
nature
unless of course it is an erosion problem instead?

John
