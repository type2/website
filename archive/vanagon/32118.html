Subject: Re: Alternator Bearings (90 Amp)


Ball and roller bearings are generic things.  If you take one to an outfit
like 'Wynn's All-Bearing Supply'  they will mike it, count the number of
balls (or rollers), and the number of rows if more than one, look up the
combination of dimensions, and obtain a replacement.

The 'gotcha!' is that some bearings are unique, as with the outer roller
bearing in early bus outboard gearboxes.  The folks at All-Bearing had no
trouble cross-referencing it but it turns out there is only one souce, the
same folks who supply Volkswagen.  Even so, the price is liable to be less
than you would pay if you went to VW or a VW-specific after-market supplier,
who always seem to tack on a little extra $.
