Steve queries:

&gt; I *have* heard from Vanagon
&gt; owners who had the ghost harness installed and it didn't make a lick of
&gt; difference; at least it didn't fix the &quot;cut-out&quot; symptom which seems to be
&gt; associated with the lurching and bucking.  Anybody else had the harness
&gt; installed to no avail?

For two more data points:

My 86 Syncro: No harness replacement, Cut out has occurred one 1 occasion
              in the last 3 years. (that was after a 2 hour 65 MPH cruise
              on an interstate.)

A friend's 87 Syncro: Harness replaced, Intermittent problem still occurrs
                      on a &quot;regular&quot; basis, about once a month.
