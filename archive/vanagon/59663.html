Subject: Re: consumer reports

Consumer Reports is not biased.  They report the true facts about their 
products.  Auto magazines sometimes omit information that will make a car 
look bad.  Compare the VW Trends magazine article of the first Eurovan 
with the article in Car &amp; Driver or Road and Track.  Then look at 
Consumer Reports.  VW Trends has a very favorable report, Road &amp; Track 
has an average report, and Consumer Reports has a less than favorable 
report.  It's the auto magazines that are biased, not the private testing 
facilities.  Also, many auto magazines receive compensation from the 
manufacturers for printing favorable articles on their vehicles.
