It was only 1 gallon.  And don't forget the mulled wine.  :)

It was really hot... and I wouldn't even say &quot;almost to hot&quot;, I'd say it 
was DAMN HOT!  Before the sun even came up I had to take off my sweater, 
and after it came up I had to take off the flannel shit.  I had to get 
out of there around 8am because it was so warm.  In contrast, the 
previous night I slept in the back of my bus...  And I wore full 
thermals, sweatshirt, down parka, and stayed in my sleeping bag, and I 
was STILL cold.
