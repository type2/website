Subject: Johns Car Corner...(was '86 ECU...)

&gt;BTW, John's Car Corner had one, I ordered it, waited 5 days, it never
&gt;showed, I called them, they said &quot;oh, that unit was defective so we didn't
&gt;send, guess we should have called&quot;, Yeah, well, no _ _ _ _!

Yeah, I just want to second that view on Johns Car Corner ( Westminster VT)
I have ordered stuff from them in the past - and never got it.
I had to even go as far as photocopying a retuned check (that they had already
cashed) and mailing it back to them because they did not believe I had paid
them. 
I have known others besides tony that they have given the runaround to. 
And it took me about a month to get them to return my money both times I had
ordered stuff from them - and one of those times, they never even had the part
to begin with, after they ASSURED me that they had it. Every time I had ordered
stuff from them, they have always screwed it up. 

My conclusion??   They are a bunch of A-holes, and would not advise anyone doing
business with them.
