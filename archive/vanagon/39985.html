&gt; Ok, here is another tire question for you guys.
&gt; 
&gt; I need new tires for my '72 Safare.  Primarily for this 3000 mile trip.
&gt; What make/model tire should I purchase that works well on later model busi?
&gt; 
&gt; Specs: '72 Safare Custom Camper
&gt;        '77 2000cc F.I Engine
&gt; 	80% Highway Driving

I bought some 205-70HR14's for about $100/pair.  The HR rating results
in really stiff sidewalls (felt stiffer than load range D to me) and
they handle absolutely great.  I have no regrets, other than I think I
will go with 215-70 or 205-75 in back next time to get a little more
ground clearance.
