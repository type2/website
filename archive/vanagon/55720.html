Subject: Local VW siteings!

I just wanted to throw out the the group what I had Observed the other day while 
test driving a Vanagon around town ( Santa Cruz Cal). I wrote a list of VW I saw and 
broke them down in different groups.

  Vanagon 7 Passenger  2
  Westy Vangons, 3
  Type 2 Westys, 2
  Type 2 passenger vans, 2
  Early bus campers, 1
  Bugs 9
  Vert Bug 1
  H2O VW's 15
  

   Now for the biggest SIGHTING of the AM!  I work 3 doors down from the dealer ( 
Figure that, a VW shop that can do a killer business 3 doors down from the dealer MUST 
be doing something right :) On a Flatbed behind a Semi Truck is a Threesome of 
Eurovans.  Quite a funny sight 3 White eurovans on a flatbed.

  38 VW's in about a 30 minute period I sighted.  I'm sharing this with the list for a 
couple of reasons; I have a hard time understanding when I see postings about someone 
seeing &quot;A Vanagon today!&quot;  I see SO Many Vanagons, let alone VW's a day!

  I'm NOT putting anyone down, just letting people know that there is a HUGE 
population of VW's, and Vanagons here in Northern California.  It's not uncommon for 
me to see 4 or 5 Syncros in a given day.  I'm not sure if it's due to the fact that I 
live in a colledge town, or just being Northern Cal or what.

  What was the funniest thing was that I was doing my little survey on the amount of 
VW's in town, then I see the Eurovans on the Semi was the best part :)
