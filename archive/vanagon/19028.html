So Drew B. Farenwald says:
&gt; Short story.  Sunday.  Parked Stella ('93 Eurovan) in an outdoor lot at 
&gt; the edge of little Italy near the Inner Harbor in Baltimore.  Enjoyed a 
&gt; funky evening of Average White Band/Ohio Players/War at Pier Six.  Woke 
&gt; Stella up a little after 11:00 to head home.  Backed up, no power 
&gt; steering, alternator light blaring.  :-0  

And another thing I hate about those EV's.  Those damn blaring alternator
lights!   ;p

&gt; the dangling pan.  Reaches down with the vicegrips and comes up with a   
&gt; ...     rat.  Yep.  The critter crawled up in there and got terminally 
&gt; creased by the belt and the compressor pulley but knocked the belt off 
&gt; in the process.  That dirty rat cost me $116 and an afternoon.  But, 
&gt; hey, Stella caught that rat.  Good girl.

And another thing I hate about those EV's.  Those damn rats!  What was
VW thinking when they put those in?!  I just don't understand.  Rats in
a Eurovan....  Who woulda thought?  ......

;p   ;)   ;p
