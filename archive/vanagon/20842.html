Subject:       Belzona experience??

now that i have your attention...

Belzona is an industrial 2 part epoxy that has (reportedly) quite 
high temp resistance and strength.  i got some from a friend that 
uses it to repair crack in a rotating kiln for drying wood chips.  
does anyone have any experience with this stuff or a spec sheet?  it 
is horribly expensive, like $50 for 2 pouches about the size of a 
Carnation Hot Chocolate Mix packet.

waiting with bait-like breath,

-dan
