Subject: pulling a trailer? &lt;splittie and vanagon&gt;

I know of a very cool smallish &quot;vintage type&quot; trailer that is available. The
title shows 600 lbs. (dry and empty). Comes with a 10' x 10' tent!

Please contact me off line if anyone has insights/experiences outside of the
usual warnings of heat and pressure gauges.
