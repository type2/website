Subject:      Tires . . . I know :(

So, here we go again . . . it seems the regional availability of tires
causes much discussion on this list.  I'm looking for reccomendations on
the right thing to do.

If I had my choice, I would like to get some 205 75 R14's with
reinforced sidewalls.  This does not appear to be available.  Options:

195 75 R14's w/ reinforced sidewall.  My understanding is that this tire
will affect the speedometer reading slightly and cause engine RPMs to
increase (over my present tire) for a given speed.

205 75 R14's non-reinforced sidewall.  Not sure the significance of
this.  I assume the vehicle will be more &quot;tippy&quot;?

So, which is the lesser of two evils?

Suggestions appreciated,
