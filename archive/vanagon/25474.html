Subject: vanagons DO drive better with sway bars

all,

Sunday I found out that my '83 westy had broken its connector in the sway
bar sometime in its past....I never noticed it because it broke right in
the bushing and only upon lifting did the ugly truth reveal itself.  
According to Big Green they changed the sway design in late '84;  this 
had me worried because it really narrows down the target date for junking.
The good news is that as long as you replace the whole baralong with
the two connectors {$75.00 at L&amp;T enterprizes Allentown PA} there is no
problem what-so-ever.  I realized during my test drive that that connector
must have been broken for quite a while...it now drives better than the
'92 Passat besides being much cooler.
