Subject: Engine has to be dropped

I have been trying for 3 days to accomplish the &quot;straight forward&quot; water
pump replacement in my '86. I even called in a mechanic for help.  The
allen head screws that attach the pipes to the water pump body will not
budge.  I tried to remove the crank pully also, thinking this would give me
room. It is put on with 250+ ft lbs or torque. I bent my 1/2 in breaker
bar.  I have never had such a problem with a small job.  I have decided to
drop the engine, for better access. I think the approach will be to cut
loose the allen heads.

I have a couple of questions for the group.  This van has 100k on it so I
think it is wise to replace the clutch ,Throw Out bearing, and pressure
plate. What else do I need to do in regard to preventive maintnance?  The
heads and seals are still the originals. What is the best source for the
parts that I need? I normally use mail order from Hoy-Fox in El Paso, but I
have had problems getting them to ship on the promised date.

ANY help on tips or parts will be appreciated.

Bill
