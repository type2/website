&gt; 
&gt; First I've heard of that. Which ones?

In addition to those that Thom mentioned, there are thousands of trucks
running around with aluminum body panels.  Ever look closely at that
U-haul van you rented last year when you moved?  Yup, Aluminum.  I think
(or at least have thought in the past) that the main reason auto makers
chose steel is that it is less expensive.  And the fact that it rusts
out eventually doesn't hurt either.  :)

I seem to remember that a few of the new cars coming out had aluminum
hoods and stuff... was it the Lincoln Mark VIII?  Cadillac?  I can't
remember, but I'm sure I heard that somewhere...
