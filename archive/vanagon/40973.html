Subject: [Syncro]:  K&amp;N filters 

Hey Syncro-nuts,  I can't say anything about quality and performance claims,
but hell the price is right if you get 2 years out of the filter, bargain if
it really lasts and works as well as the severe duty VW filters.  Tim Smith

&gt;&gt;Any listing for a 1987 VW vanagon Syncro, 2.1l 4cyl gas.  VW sells two Mann 
&gt;&gt;paper element filters.  Here in Canada the regular one is $44, the severe
duty 
&gt;&gt;one is $138, no kidding.  Intake system has a built in cyclone seperator and 
&gt;&gt;snorkel inlet, so I need a stock shaped filter element.  Don't want to ditch 
&gt;&gt;the system.   Whatcha got?   Tim Smith

&gt;Hello Tim,
&gt;
&gt;Thank you very much for your K&amp;N inquiry.  The drop-in replacement K&amp;N
&gt;filter part number for your Vanagon is E-2475 with special pricing
&gt;(below dealer cost) of $26.95 plus $9.51 shipping by priority mail. 
&gt;Please keep in mind that this is designed to exactly replace the stock
&gt;filter element.......so if you are currently using an old stock filter
&gt;element, it should be a perfect fit.  These K&amp;N filters are far more
&gt;severe duty than anything else on the market!
&gt;
&gt;These filters offer an honest 3-5% extra HP and usually 1-2 mpg better
&gt;mileage.  K&amp;N filters generally last up to 10 years since they are
&gt;re-usable and cleanable.  Over the long run, your savings will be
&gt;substantial for this reason alone.
&gt;
&gt;We recommend purchasing K&amp;N's two bottle cleaner/oil maintenance kit
&gt;for $6.95 plus an extra $1 for shipping.  Every K&amp;N order receives a
&gt;free copy of K&amp;N's 130 page catalog.
&gt;
&gt;In an effort to keep K&amp;N pricing to you as low as possible, we do not
&gt;accept credit cards.   Credit card processing is costly and would
&gt;bring prices up.  We do however accept personal checks from
&gt;internetters. (California residents please add local sales tax). 
&gt;Please send all inquiries and payments to:
&gt;
&gt;Performance International
&gt;Attn:  Bob Franzke
&gt;696 West 18th Street
&gt;Costa Mesa, CA  92627
&gt;
&gt;We ship via priority mail direct to your mailbox.  We have hundreds of
&gt;satisfied K&amp;N customers from the internet over the last 2 years.  We
&gt;confirm when your order arrives from the K&amp;N factory and when it ships
&gt;to you by email.
