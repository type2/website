Subject: Flywheel removal question

Hi all,
	I was just wondering if there is any other way to remove that 
36mm gland nut (I think that's what it's called) which holds onto my 
flywheel besides using an impact driver.  What does everyone else use?  I 
need to switch mine with an automatic driveplate.  You see, I'm putting 
(well, trying to put) a '71 1600 DP (MT) into my '73 bus/camper (AT) 
because I want to drive it again.  Waaah! I want my bus.  The closest 
I've been to driving a bus lately was sitting in the '66 Westy as we 
towed it to my house, leaving a lot to be desired.  Hey, can anyone point 
me to some 6v to 12v conversion info?  Please.

Thanks,
-Erik.
