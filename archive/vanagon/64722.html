&lt;&lt; OK Volks - here's the &quot;skinny&quot; on what you have been looking for.  First
 of all, it's been discontinued, at least at the dealers on the North
 American Continent (I checked with my contact at VOA in Troy, MI), so it
 may be available still in Europe.

 P/N 025-905-209A  Screening Ring (is what it's called in the fiche).
 Boot looks really funky in the fiche diagram.

 The coil also used one of these as well - P/N 251-905-209 (Also
 discontinued)

 &gt;Hi There.  I've owned our '90 Syncro since new, and all I know is
 &gt;that there is a black bag that fits over the distributor cap and
 &gt;ignition wires at the cap. &gt;&gt;

For what it is worth to those who want to waterproof their ignition systems,
BUGPACK and couple of other aftermarket types maket little prophalactic
distributor cap covers and coil covers for this very purpose.
