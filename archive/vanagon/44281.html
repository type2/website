Subject: 19 or 23 window Bus wanted

I'm looking for a split for a good friend.It must have the overhead windows,sun-
roof and wrap-around rear windows.Also; no rust or rust repair and preferrably
on the east coast(though not imperative) He's willing to pay absolute top dollar
for the right one.All responses will be considered. What do we have out there folks?
