Subject: 15K report on Redline MTL

It's been over a year and 15K miles since I began using Redline MTL
synthetic gear oil in my syncro transmission. There have been no leaks or
other problems of any sort. She still shifts really easily and smoothly,
even in 20F weather (about as cold as it gets here in Seattle). I remain a
satisfied customer.
