Hey that sounds great!  But I do have a question: How was the gas milage 
on your weekender?

&gt; There has been a message posted regarding replacement tires. I want to put
&gt; in my comments in case it could be of some help to someone.
&gt; When I bought my 86 Westy Weekender from my son-in-laws father, it had
&gt; ordinary car tires. They were almost new and he had put them on. Got some
&gt; bad advice from a tire dealer I guess. These are only rated for 35 psi and
&gt; were aired way above that to the amounts shown on vehicle stickers. In
&gt; addition to handling lousy in the wind , and being hard to turn wheels at
&gt; stop or slow speed (no power steering) I was concerned about carcass
&gt; damage to overinflation. 
&gt; I did some checking and finally settled on Bridgestone 185R14 LT ( Light
&gt; Truck) tires. These are 8 ply rated and each is rated at 1850 lb load _at_ 65
&gt; psi.
&gt; I inflated these per the vehicle instructions. What a world of difference.
&gt; Beautiful handling dry, wet or in wind. No more wander. Much easier to
&gt; turn wheels stopped or at very slow speed. These are tires made to handle
&gt; proper weight and psi. Price was satisfactory for quality tires and after
&gt; running them a while they would be cheap at twice the price. Wholehearted
&gt; recommend these.
