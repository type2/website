Subject: Re: tents? popups?  who cares?

Hi gang.  Mr. Language Jerk here.

Please stop referring to that fiberglass-roofed, canvas-sided thing 
that pops up atop your westy as a tent.  It ain't a tent.  It's a 
popup or poptop or movable roof or lichen farm or something, but it's 
not a tent!

Of course, Mr. Language Jerk knows what a tent is.  A tent is 
something you typically remove from your vehicle prior to driving it, 
right?  Unless, that is, it's a hang-on-the-side thingie and you're 
not going more than a few miles to the next site, and you kinda like 
the ability to tack on a four-lane road.

Poptops.  Tents.  Poptops.  Tents.

Having set the list straight, Mr. Language Jerk can retire to his lair for the 
evening.
