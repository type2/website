Subject: Re: VANAGON digest 755

&gt;on their webpage? And while thinking about it, I do not remember seeing
&gt;where anyone has put information about this list or VintagVW on their
&gt;page.  Maybe this would help others find this GREAT pool of knowledge.

        Check out mine. The Vanagon sub info was there in my very first
draft along with the Grateful Dead stuff. Didn't add info about *me* until
the 2nd and 3rd drafts...

Peace,
