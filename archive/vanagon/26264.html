Eric, I have a '71 Westy that I have had the trns and/or engine out more
than several times and i too have a considerable amount of play in the main
shaft of the trans.  while i could'nt tell you if it is normal or not, I
have I guess you could say intentionally ovwerlooked it and have indeed put
many thousands of miles, both far type miles and local type miles and have
had no problems with the bus.
