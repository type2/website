Subject: Re: EV Tire Report - Blizzaks

&gt; Over the past couple of years I have been recommending the Michelin MXLs for 
&gt; the EV as an all around tire. It's better in all conditions than the Contis 
&gt; that came with my EV, and others have rated it better than the OEM GoodYears 
&gt; as well.

Consider me a disenter on that.  Recently put on the Michelins and MUCH 
prefer the old Goodyears.  Haven't seen the long term wear but the 
Goodyears were far better at wet or snow in my experiences (well trusting 
memory on that).  It was a flat road but the Goodyears laughed at 30 
inches of unplowed snow last winter.  Not sure though I have the exact 
same Michelins as you did.  These did fine but not great on some real 
dirt road (I mean dirt not gravel) packed snow driving this year.  Got 
stopped on a hill I think the old tires would have gotten up.

Sounds like the snow tires are better than my experiences with the 
Goodyears though.  Don't have the ABS - and don't regret that either...
