&gt;&gt; and now a word from your Health Department....  cook poultry to an
&gt;&gt; internal temperature of 170 F, don't stuff the bird as it slows down
&gt;&gt; the heat transfer and creates cool spots.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; use a separate cutting board and knife (or just wash them well) for
&gt;&gt; raw meat.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Also, don't forget to cover that gravy when not in use...
&gt;warm thick broth like that is the perfect breeding ground for 
micro-organisms
&gt;
&gt;&gt; the BIGGEST reason some of us will get sick this holiday is because
&gt;&gt; Aunt Harriet, who hasn't been feeling well recently, didn't wash her
&gt;&gt; hands before buttering her buns.

Does this mean I can't put popcorn in my heater boxes any more?  :-O
