&lt;&lt; Anyway, this morning he brought me a copy of an article out of the
 April 1990 Car and Driver magazine on a supposedly one-off TriStar Syncro.
 Somehow, I thought there was more one, but obviously not many.  There's a
 quote from a VWOA person (&quot;Volkswagen U.S.'s Vanagon chief) - &quot;We don't see
 a market for the Tri Star at the price we'd have to charge for it.&quot;
 Supposedly that price would have been $35,000-$40,000.  But this is a loaded
 vehicle - a concept car type. &gt;&gt;

At that time VW was &quot;fishing&quot; for potential market for this rig.  Not long
after they began importing them into Canada.  I'm sure that they didn't sell
many, but in 1991 could be ordered at any Canadian VW dealer.  They did cost
PLENTY!!

The feature that the TriStar had that would be especially difficult to obtain
by trying to &quot;upgrade&quot; a dual-cab Syncro is its FOURTH door.  Typical
dual-cabs had a rear passenger door only on the right side of the truck,
while the TriStars have rear passenger doors on both sides!!  Wish I had
one!!
