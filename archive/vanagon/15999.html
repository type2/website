Subject: Safety Recall RV
              Replace Fuel Injectors and Components

Dear Volkswagen Owner:

This notice is sent to you in accordance with the requirements of the 
Canadian Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.

Volkswagen has determined that a defect which relates to motor 
vehicle safety exists is some 1990/91 model Volkswagen and Syncro 
vehicles.  Our records indicate that your vehicle is affected by this 
voluntary recall action.

DEFECT DESCRIPTION
Volkswagen has determined that the engine's fuel injectors may not 
have been properly sealed against outside influence.  In high 
humidity, moisture could enter the injector(s) and cause intermittent 
interruption of an injector's electrical operation, resulting in cold 
start difficulties and/or engine miss.

REMEDY
Your Volkswagen service technician will replace the engine's fuel 
injectors, including the connecting fuel distribution rails, fuel 
lines, hoses and clamps.

YOUR ACTION
Please contact the Service Department of your authorized Volkswagen 
dealer for an appointment to have the necessary work performed as 
soon as possible.  The repair will take approximately two hours and 
will, of course, be free of charge.  Necessary instructions and an 
initial parts supply have been sent to all Volkswagen dealers.

PRECAUTION
In the event you experience engine miss prior to having your vehicle 
repaired, please contact your nearest Volkswagen dealer without 
delay.  For your convenience, we have included a listing of the 
Volkswagen dealers located within your province.

We regret any inconvenience this matter may cause; however, as part 
of our commitment to ensure your safety and maintain your 
satisfaction with our project, we would like to repair your vehicle 
as soon as possible.

Thank you for driving a Volkswagen.

Sincerely,

blah blah

Already called the dealer.  The parts should arrive within the next 
two weeks.  Cool.  New injectors for free.  That will cost VW some 
pennies (profits ??).

Harry.
