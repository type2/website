&gt;This is for those of you who are &quot;fortunate&quot; enough to own a Vanagon with
&gt;an oil cooler.  CHECK IT NOW !  Before it's too late  !
&gt;&lt;horror story deleted&gt;
&gt;cooler to find the BROKEN O-ring behind.  Whether or not the -35 temp. had
&gt;anything to do with this is not sure.  All I know is that the van got started
&gt;moral of this story is, check your oil cooler and change that O-ring if
&gt;it's suspect.  Mine was cooked - hard - brittle - so the high oil pressure
&gt;at - 35 startup blew it, most probable scenario.  I guess I was lucky that
&gt;the noise was just a collapsed lifter, it COULD have been worse !

it could have been a lot worse! someone who used to be on the list already
lost their engine because of this!!! here's the tech info on it:
