Subject: Bleeding the coolant system/ heater core leak
Date: Wed, 18 Jun 1997 12:46:11 -0500

Does anyone know of any special procedures for bleeding a coolant system =
after the bleeder valve on the heater core has been removed (it broke =
and soaked my interior on the way home last night).  I would think that =
you would bleed the heater core valve just like the radiator, although =
that would get coolant in the car I see no other options.  Please help.  =
BTW the new bleeder valve screw was $2.15 and the o-ring was $.34 from =
the VW dealer, 1 of the 7 dealers here in St. Louis actually had both in =
stock!
