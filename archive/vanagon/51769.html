&gt; Hey! Stop laughing! This is serious! 
&gt; 
&gt; My buddy's Carat came with all the original cupholders broken or
&gt; removed, and I'd like to get four for the Syncro Westie as well. 
&gt; 
&gt; I saw the thread in the archives about OEM cupholders
&gt; being seen at K-Mart or Wal-Mart. Well, around here, no luck.
&gt; Wal-mart doesn't have anything like it, K-Mart has a cheap
&gt; imitation, no joy either at the local warehouse-type parts 
&gt; stores. So several questions:
&gt; 
&gt; (1) Anybody seen any lately?
&gt; (2) Where?
&gt; (3) Are they really identical to the VW unit, or just similar.
&gt; If that is the case, maybe it was the K-Mart version (with a
&gt; spring steel band holding the cup) was the item talked about earlier.
&gt; (4) Anybody actually buy one and know who the manufacturer is;
&gt; maybe I could contact them to find someone retailing them?
&gt; 
&gt; Any and all help appreciated.

About 5 years ago I found cupholders similar to the OEM ones, the only
difference is that these have a picture or a cup of the outside and are
adjustable for the size of the cup.  If you are interested call Camping
World at 1-800-845-7875, this number is fro a free catalog I think, good
luck.
