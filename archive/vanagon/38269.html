Subject: Carb rebuild time (34Pict3)


Hi All,

Bus season returns to Ottawa.

I just dug my '66 out of the snow (twenty feet, 3 feet high) and managed to
nurse her to the location where I do my work on her.  She needs a thing or two.

Anyway, top of the list is a card rebuilt.  I've now got a rebuild kit and
am ready to start.  Almost.  I read a book that recommended soaking the carb 
for a while but didn't mention what solution to soak it in.

Can someone please let me know what solvent to soak the carb in prior to a 
rebuilt?  And how long to soak it for?  

Thanks,
...Markus
