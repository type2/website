Subject: RE: Mid-Atlantic Micros, Sat. 22 Oct. 94

Sorry for the short notice, I should have posted
this sooner (but work has been very busy this week):

The Mid-Atlantic Micros are getting together again!
There is a group of microbus owners in the Baltimore,
MD area meeting at Blob's Park in/near Baltimore on
Sat. morning. They will be caravaning up to Gettysburg,
PA.

They plan to be at the Electric Map in Gettysburg by
about 12 or 12:30, where they can add additional buses
into the group (there's no way we are driving down from
NJ to MD to go back to PA!). The plan is to tour Gettys-
burg, caravan style - the flyer says to bring the 
family.

Rain date is Sunday, 23 Oct. Weather reports so far are
favorable for tomorrow, so I expect it will go off then. 

Lori

p.s. for those of you who saw this on vintagvw, sorry
for the duplicate post!
