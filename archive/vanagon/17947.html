Subject: Re: Need Help Power windows

&gt;My passenger side power window in my 91 Vanagon is broken....
&gt;I took off the door covering and found out what the problem is...but dont 
&gt;know the 
&gt;best way to fix it....
&gt;
&gt;There is a verticle metal bracket upon which the window rides up and down ....
&gt;sitting in this bracket is a thin guide wire/cable....at the bottom of the door
&gt;the cable makes a 90degree turn with the help of a plastic giude that snaps 
&gt;into the verticle metal bracket....however this plastic guid has snapped out 
&gt;of its guide.._dot_causing the cable/wire to not sit along the bracket...this 
&gt;results in
&gt;a stuck window....
&gt;Does anyone know how to losen up this cable so I can snap this 90degree 
&gt;plastic cuide back into place???

This is NOT fixable.  In my '92 Passat, the back windows (not the front for
some reason) are operated by a similar mechanism and one of them broke in
the way I think you are describing.  There is a secret warranty on this and
my power windows were fixed for free.  They did both sides, by the way, not
just the side that was broken.  Go talk to your dealer.

Well, this is the reason:
It's because on that night you are in somebody else's dream.
And the reason you can't be in your own dream because
you're already busy in somebody else's dream.
