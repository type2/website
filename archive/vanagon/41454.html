&gt;On Monday morning I started my '87 Syncro to discover an &quot;idle&quot; speed of
4400
&gt;RPM.  I drove the van for close to three hours and the problem was
&gt;consistant.  I've switched out the Idle Stabilizer Control Valve with one
&gt;known to be good and had the same problem.  Next I disconnected the pair of
&gt;wires attached to the Idle Stabilizer Control Valve and the van idled
&gt;normally while warm.  I suspect that this means that I have a problem with
&gt;the Idle Control Module or perhaps the throttle position switch. 

I've diagnosed this as a faulty (fried) Idle Control Module.  This is the
little black box that's mounted forward of the right/rear tail light.  It
looks like an over-sized relay.

So I need a new one.  The original part is 251 907 393 B.  VW's latest &amp;
greatest rendition is 251 907 393 D.  Does anyone have one of these for sale
at a reasonable price?
The dealer quoted $208.65 &amp; I have a 20%-Off coupon for a dealer sell price
of $166.92. I suspect Camelback in Phoenix might sell it for around $150 or
so.  I'm hoping to buy one for much less. I'm going to start calling wrecking
yards now.

Does anyone know why one of these electrical items would suddenly fail after
9 years of service.  One of the components on the circuit boards inside is
clearly burnt.

Thanks,

Jim Davis
