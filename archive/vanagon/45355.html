Subject: 88 Waterboxer exhaust
From: chawk_at_juno_dot_com (j g shepard)

Any suggestions on getting a new exhaust system for my Vanagon? All I
really need is the pipe between the collector and the catalytic
converter.  I will eventually get the whole system when the time comes. 
I'm  beginning to realise how much more expensive parts are for Vanagons
compared to splits and bay windows.  Having owned a 60 Kombi, 64
Sun(something) camper, 67 and 71 Westfalias and 70 Bus, I'm wondering if
i should have gotten an older VW instead of the 88 Vanagon.  I guess  I'm
just getting burned out on working on my new VW and no0t being able to
drive it yet. Enough whining, I feel much better now. Thanks for letting
me vent.

PS: Does Sundowner sound right?
