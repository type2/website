Well, for what its worth, I was a fireman with CDF for 6 years, and saw 
many a grinder, but never peeled a blue out of a bus.

Lots of gore in toyotas/nissans/datsuns/etc

And don't get me started on the harley vs cement truck stories.  On 680,
between Livermore and Fremont, you have a gravel plant on one side of the
freeway, and a biker bar on the other, and the two sometimes mix on
hwy 84.
