The esteemed William R. Kennedy, possibly representing, Kennedy, Kennedy, 
Kennedy &amp; Kennedy says:

&gt; Most of my &quot;camping&quot; experience is from the Army (which probably explains
&gt; why I have NEVER done any since).

Amen brother! It was a LONG time before we settled on camping as a family 
activity. Guess who was one of the last to be convinced that this is what 
'family togetherness meant'.

&gt; I read this thread with interest because I have a 6-year-old and
&gt; there is always some chance that he may want to be woodsy. ...

&gt; Is it really the case that generator usage is tolerated in campgrounds?

This past season, I was aware of more generators. I also observed (heard) 
more abuse and disrespect by generator users. I think it can go either way 
from now; more considerate use of generators will be met with considerate 
tolerance (and vice versa)!

&gt; I would think that some anonymous evil would befall a generator in the
&gt; woods, same as would befall a trombone played for most of the day out
&gt; there.

I still hold faith that campers and campgrounds have more respect for 
individuals and individual property than anywhere else. ;)
