Subject: Bug Screen (Joe)

Dear Joe|  I tried to set up a deal with Bill but no success. If you have
the screnn available, I would like to purchase from you. I am restoring my
78 Westy and the rear hatch bug screen is one of the missing parts.Please
let me know about the price you have for it and the cost of shipping via
regular mail or UPS 2nd. day. If you help me in this matter, I would be
deeply grateful to you.

Best regards,
Angel
