So sstones says:
&gt; Bad news folks... well not for any of you.
&gt; 
&gt; On the way to night school last night, In the school driveway,
&gt; I smashed the van...
&gt; Arrrgh!
&gt; The worst part is, because it's the front of my van...
&gt; People (insurance people) will assume it's my fault.
&gt; 
&gt; I hate morons, I hate morons, I hate morons.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not in the mood to have to deal with this shit right now.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll give details later.
&gt; 
&gt; 

Sorry to here of your mishap.  I hope it goes the other
way for you.

BTW, Why is it when I have a comparitively minor problem, someone
else has a much worse one?  ;P
