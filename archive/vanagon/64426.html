Robert,
Just incase you make it into Missouri, I put on a campout during the second
weekend in October, 10 -12. It is the 4th annual VW Fest in Mineola, MO. It
is at mile marker 170 on highway 70. That is half-way between St. Louis and
Columbia. The event is free, you just have to pay $10 per night per camping
unit to the campground. We take a scenic caravan to the historic German
town of Herman for their annual Octoberfest.

Have a safe trip,

Rick

&gt;
&gt; Well after literally years of problems in my attempts to move west, I'm
&gt; finally planning on leaving the 2nd week of September! I'll be traveling
&gt; with my girlfriend and dog in my 82 diesel westy.
&gt; I was wondering if anyone had any advice as far as things to see, do,
&gt; stay, etc... along the way.  We'll be leaving Cape Cod, traveling south
to
&gt; Tennessee to visit her parents and then from there its still up in the
&gt; air.  Our final destination is even ambiguous, probably the southwest,
&gt; but perhaps CA.
&gt; I've never been on such a long road trip before, in fact the farhest Ive
&gt; driven has been southern CT!! The van should be in good running shape
&gt; when we leave, but it would be good to know the names of any reputable VW

&gt; shops along the way, as well as any generous listees who could possibly
&gt; lend a hand, in case the unthinkable should happen! :)
&gt; We're in no rush to get wherever we land so anything is an option...
&gt; thanks
