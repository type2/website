Just a note that caught my attention in the off-road list re: Koolatrons
discussion.

A boat owner had an automobile AC compressor mounted on his boats diesel
engine.  Not for cabin cooling.  He ran the refrigerant loop though a strong
rubber 'bladder' full of saline solution?? which was in his fridge.  The AC
compressor would pump down and freeze the saline solid inside the fridge,
supposedly lasted a couple of days.  Bearing in mind a Westy in the sun is
likely hotter than a boat hull in water, and the boat fridge was likely
better insulated than the Dometics are it would help out a lot I'd guess.
Any reefer gurus want to explain to me how this could be plumbed and done in
a van? (without any AC presently) thanks.  Tim
