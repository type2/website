Subject: anti seize question

          seeing bill abbott's post about anti-seize brings up a
          question for me.  somehow i've ended up with two cans of
          anti-sleeze in the shop, one is silvery, the other coppery
          in color.  as i cannot find any info on the feelthy cans
          would someone kindly tell me the different uses of these two
          compounds?  when would i use one rather than the other?
          ray
