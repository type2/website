&gt; &gt; I can't get either of the rear brake drums off.  I've ordered the Bentley
&gt; &gt; book but haven't received it yet.  Is there some trick?  So far I've:
&gt; &gt; pulled the wheel, removed the two 11mm bolts, released the parking brake,
&gt; &gt; and yanked, banged.  The drum rotates freely and seems to be frozen on
&gt; &gt; rather than simply being held up by the brake shoes.  Is it simply a matter
&gt; &gt; of getting violent with it?  There doesn't seem to be a good way of getting
&gt; &gt; a good grasp on it to yank.  Thanks for any help.  (
&gt; 
&gt; When I worked on the rear brakes on my '87, I couldn't get the drums 
&gt; off the hubs either. I had to remove the big axle nut and pull the 
&gt; hub and drum together. Only by brutal hammering was I able to 
&gt; separate the drum and hub, which seemed to be rusted together. 
&gt; 

	When I worked on my 84 recently I had the same problem!

	Ultimately what worked was using 2 flat-head screwdrivers
	as levers.  I put them between the drum and the wheel
	&quot;plate&quot; (where all the brake components are attached to) and
	just pushed/pulled HARD! - It works after a while. Just
	try different positions: 12/6 o' clock, 9/3, etc

	good luck!
