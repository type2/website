Subject: RE: '66 Split Window (two)


&gt;Went out to Cave Junction, Ore this morning and looked at a '66
&gt;Has an &quot;F0&quot; engine possible original 1300. Rust: bottom of side doors
&gt;and I think a piece of the panel under the doors.Not gone but need
&gt;surgery. Drivers floor is cancer, about 12&quot; square. Right rear corner
&gt;is caved but fixable. This is the 4? windows behind door job. All
&gt;windows are there tho drivers window has full length crack.
&gt;Spare is bolted to front with 3 rusty bolts, no apparent cancer in
&gt;area (like the spare didn't fall on me when I pulled on it).
&gt;Battery area on right side rear is gone. Cute board to cover it.
&gt;Rear fender wells cut back tastefully to get the BIG RUBBER in there.
&gt;The head liner is in good shape. The wall stuff is gone and some one
&gt;has started stuffing insulation in. There is no interior except head
&gt;liner. Not even the driver seat. Dash is clean and all there.
&gt;
&gt;The other one: He tells me a guy gave him the other one and it is sitting
&gt;outside at Lake Selmac (few miles away) the whole interior
&gt;is gone he says and rust has settled in on everything. Has rougher body and
&gt;no engine. The windows are there but some broken. No title
&gt;abandoned on property and owner wants to sell property.So gave him
&gt;Van. Still has tranny.


Hmmm, let's see: A rusty, basically roached out splittie in the woods
of the Pacific Northwest, possible freebie, needs LOTS of work to even
get it roadworthy if that's possible...

Who ya gonna call?

Sounds in &quot;Good Condition&quot; to me!!!     :^)
