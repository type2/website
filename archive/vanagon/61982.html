Subject: Locking of Security

Hello, all

	Somebody has any idea in order to close the compartment for where the
levels of oil, water, are controlled etc.

	This this very easy to open, (alone throwing of the), and I have
thought of putting a locking of security in order to prevent possible
robberies (bar of oil, plug of oil or any mischief)=20
