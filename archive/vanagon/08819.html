&gt; Yep, the valves were real tight.  I did the right side, and then had to come 
&gt; in and warm my fingers by the fire before finishing the left.  The power was 
&gt; out today so I had no heat otherwise.

and...

&gt; At very low speeds, it sounds like grinding or scraping.  At higher rpms, it 
&gt; goes from a thunk-thunk noise to a growl.  I hear it at all speeds except the 
&gt; very fastest.  

Hmmm...  when you say fastest, do you mean engine RPMs or vehicle speed?
I assume the former...

&gt; It is most pronounced when the engine is accelerating.  

That indicates main bearing problems.  Actually, this will be one of the
cheapest things to fix, if that is the case (not counting labor). 

&gt; The green light is out at all speeds, although I do not have a pressure gauge.

That kind of DOESN'T indicate main bearings, but it doesn't rule it out.
My only other guess is that if the valves were tight enough that they
never touched the seats, you could easily have burned the exhaust valves
and/or scored the camshaft.  You might try to determine where the noise is
coming from, either by listening very closely in the areas of the heads, and
then the crankcase, or with a stethescope.  If the tight valves caused the
problem, you might get lucky and only have to replace valvetrain gear and
possibly have some work done to the heads.  At least you wouldn't have to
open the case.  Sorry if I'm rambling, but it's more interesting than
work.  :)
