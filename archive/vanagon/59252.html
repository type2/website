Dave,

I have a couple of questions ...

What is the complete designation for the tire size you are using?  What is the maximum tire 
inflation pressure stamped on the sidewalls of your tires?

Why are you running 40/30 psi tire pressures?  What does the owner's manual say for tire 
pressures?

Michael
