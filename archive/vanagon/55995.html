My '86 had the same problem.  Ended up being a bad connection to the fuel
pump.  Didn't hear a buzz when I tried to start it.

&gt; 
&gt; Oooops, was so whacked out by my near-perfect new '91 Syncro Westy not
&gt; starting, that I spaced out saying what vehicle it is.  So here's a
repost
&gt; with more details:
&gt; 
&gt; '91 Syncro, 2.1 engine, 49k miles, two month old battery, outside
&gt; temperature in the forties with strong wind, driving at an elevation of
&gt; about 6,000+', wet snow on the road.  
&gt; 
&gt; After driving a couple of hundred miles today, the final stretch of about
80
&gt; miles after having stopped for ten minutes, I turned off the engine, and
a
&gt; few minutes later it wouldn't start.  There was spark, it turned over,
&gt; didn't sputter, just wouldn't start.  After about 30 minutes it started
up
&gt; again and ran fine.  What's up?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm on the road away from home (Colorado) and my trusty super-hero
mechanic,
&gt; now in Northern AZ and hopefully headed for Tucson tomorrow AM, then
after a
&gt; few days, on to Mexico.  Had the van thoroughly checked out before
leaving
&gt; home and was told everything was in excellent mechanical condition.  I'm
a
&gt; mechanical nincompoop and don't want car problems down there!  What
should I
&gt; have checked out?  Anyone know where between Holbrook and Tucson there's
a
&gt; reliable and good mechanic? (Assuming I can run tomorrow to get it to
&gt; someone.......)
