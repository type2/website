Subject: Fuel Filter Worries

I just finished a 3100 mile round trip from Seattle to the Grand Canyon.  I 
finished with 123000 miles.  About 1100 miles into the trip in Panguitch, UT 
at a Coke stop I noticed the electric fuel pump (windows down) making a very 
loud whine.  We were just about to enter relatively uninhabited country on 
the Navaho Reservation for the next 300 miles so I was sweating a bit.  The 
pump also double clutched (ran 2 distinct times) when I turned on the 
ignition key like it took longer than usual to bring the fuel system to 
pressure.  On arrival at the GC I called my wife and requested that she 
express me a pump and fuel filter.

VW service told her that the fuel pumps rarely ever fail (what does the list 
think?) so she bought a used fuel pump ($45).  They further recommended that 
I replace the filter first and see what happens.  Following 6 days of 
backpacking I did just that.  I drove the 1600 miles home with no further 
incident; the loud whine is gone but the longer initial run time is still 
there.  This turned out to be a very easy field repair (borrowed vice grips 
to squeeze the fuel line, and needle noze pliers were the only tools).

Any other fuel pump stories?
