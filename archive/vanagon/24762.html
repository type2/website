Yes!  I have a '66 and need any parts I can get my hands on!!

Urgently needed items:

Front Nose Skin

If you can cut this off cleanly, I want it!  If not, over cut it and I 
will clean it myself.  I need this so bad I can taste it.  My current 
nose is 75% bondo and the window seals have nothing to grip to.  I will 
gladly pay whatever it costs to ship it.  According to several places I 
have looked into for a new replacement, they are UPS shippable.  I need 
this, it must be in better shape than mine!

Steering Box/Column

This is a one piece unit.  If it is in good condition, I need it.  Mine 
currently has about 2-inches of play.. not good at all!

Cargo Floors

Not sure if this is possible to cleanly cut out.  But if so.. I need 
cargo floor sections.

Needed, but not urgent items:

Steering Wheel

Any seats in restorable condition

Washer squirter bottle with hose

Wiper arms

Elephant Mirrors

You should see my '66.. it is sweet... frame is solid, no holes in the 
body, no bondo with the exception of the front nose.  Not even surface 
rust!  The only surface rust is on the pop-out window mouldings.  You 
parts would be going to a very good home.

I wish I was in Utah.. I would take everything I could carry! :-)

Thanks!  My voice phone is 612.551.1829.. call collect if necessary!  I 
need those urgent parts.  I want to weld and paint this winter while I 
build a new engine..
