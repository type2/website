Subject: '84 VANAGON A/C &amp; OTHER MYSTERIES

I could use some advice. I am fixing up our '84 Vanagon Westfalia. It 
has air conditioning wich doesn't work at all.

I am not familiar with AC systems in practice (but know the theory) 
since most of the cars I have worked on are English sports-cars.

Anyway. I believe the previous owner had something go wrong with the 
Ac and had it disconnected instead of having it fixed. At the moment 
there are no belts going to the compressor (I guess replacing them 
would be the obvious first step). The blower motor works (I believe it 
is in the compartment attached to the inside/back of the van facing 
forward). I tried turning on the AC and I don't think  that the 
electric clutch on the compressor is working (no signs of life when 
switched on and off). It doesn't click or anything. (Does it have to 
be spinning (belted) to work?) Anyway, Does anyone know how I can 
check out the compressor or test for leaks on my own? Does the Vanagon 
AC system have any idiosyncracies that I should e aware of? Where is 
the heat exchanger? Is it up front? If the compressor is kaput does 
anyone know how much they cost? 

It would be great to get the AC working before it starts to warm up. 
Since this won't be for a few months I thought I could tackle it 
myself.

Here are some more less critical questions...
1) Any idea how long the refrigerator can be run using propane? I 
think the stock tank holds 3 gallons? 
2) Can the refrigerator be run off propane whilst driving? The manual 
isn't specific on this.
3)About how much do the gas-struts which support the rear hatch/door 
cost to replace? Should I go to the dealer?
4) What are the pros and cons of installing a seconf battery under the 
drivers seat? (I camp often, but am not used to comfort.._dot_usually I 
camp from a motorcycle)
5)My petrol tank leaks when near full. I assume it is leaking from the 
level-sender. How do I get at this? There seem to be two great straps 
holding the tank to the frame; How are they secured?

One last great mystery...  On the dash just to the left of the lighter 
socket is a smaller socket. It is a type I have never seen before. It 
is only about a third the size of  the lighter socket and no mention 
is made of it in the manual? It could be aftermarket, but it doesn't 
look like it. Haven't checked it out with the multimeter yet or tried 
to follow the line behind the dash (if there is one). Is this familiar 
to anyone? What is it and what is it for?


Thanks for any help in advance...

Sean
