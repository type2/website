Subject: RE: Diesel Vanagon Starters


&gt;I've had mine for nearly four years and have been through 3 new starters 
and
&gt;one rebuild.
&gt;I wish I know what the problem was, but the starter is one of the weak 
points
&gt;on the diesel Vanagon.

Actually, the last two starter problems I've had (one on a VW and one
on a '66 Mustang) have both been caused by a bad battery ground cable.
On the Mustang, the cable was bolted to a less-than-completely conductive
part of the engine. I moved it to the smog pump mount, cleaned it up and
torqued it down, and have had zero problems since.

On the V6anagon, my starter sometimes cranks very slowly, particularly
when the engine is warm. I suspect corrosion where the ground cable
bolts to the body... as well as the incomprehensible positioning of
the battery under the right front passenger's seat??? For weight
distribution, maybe? I plan to relocate it to the engine compartment
similar to where my '71 had its battery, with new cables bolted directly
to the engine block and starter.
