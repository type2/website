Subject: '73 type IV rebuild questions

Okay, Hi everyone.
	In case no one remembers, I've been working on the engine from my '73
bus\camper thingy.  I had a lot of trouble getting the heads off but today I
finally succeeded.  Oh boy, it seems that the intake valve seat on #3 somehow
slipped out and got jammed askew in the head.  Not only that but the piston has
been hitting it and now has a nice dent on the face (it is right to assume that
the piston need replacing?).  For some reason, piston #4 has a similar but not
so big dent, also from the intake valve I guess.

So now, of course, I have some questions.

1. It's pretty obvious that I need heads, so I'll be getting a nice pair soon.

2. I need pistons right?  Do I need to get cylinders too?  Do I have to replace
all four together?  Should I?

3. In case I need to get pistons and cylinders, and I'm getting new heads
already, I'm thinking about getting something with a bigger bore.  How does
that sound?  Do bigger cyls require a different head or do they all fit on the
stock 1700 heads.  Or will I need different heads for what I'm thinking. 
Basically, I would like someone to tell me a decent piston\cyl\head setup which
will give me a bit more power but not cost too much because I am poor.

Thank You.
Erik.
