Subject: Re: Eurovan Tire Questions

&gt; Anyone have experience with these tires?  What are other EV'ers using for
&gt; tires?
&gt; 

Mine came stock with English made Goodyear G64.  Had one shredded by road 
debris when an accident occured right in front of me.  We had to get a 
new one from a Just Tires (owned by Goodyear)  Not cheap but great 
tires.  A bit noisy but they hold like a dream in dry, wey or snow.  Took 
mine through unplowed streets with almost three feet of snow.

After my experiences with car tires on my Chevy S10 I would never 
consider car tires on a truck or van again.
