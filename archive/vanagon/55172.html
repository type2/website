Subject: Fwd: Vanagon Engine Alternatives

I don't think the conversion would require a change in gearing.  Most
conversions I have read about are done using a diesel Vanagon.  Most put in a
transmission from a gas van to take advantage of better gearing.  With the
135 hp Subaru motor, a five speed would be sweet.

would a conversion to the Subaru engine (Legacy?) need a change in the
gearing... I'm thinking of putting in another engine and am curious about
alternatives to the Vanagon Waterboxer...
