My favorite is the Sumitomo HTR70 185/70 HR14 for the bus.  There are other
tires, but for the size that you need, this one fits the bill.  The sidewall
is stiff for good response (as are most H rated or better tires), the tread
is deep and aggressive for excellent water dispersion, the ride is quiet and
the tire is handsome.  They look like a million bucks on my '82.  The wear
rating is 320, traction A, temp A.  It is comparable in quality with the same
rated Michelin and costs about 30% less.  Sumitomo has been making racing
tires in Japan for some years now.

Try to avoid purchasing wider, taller tires for your diesel.  The wider the
tire, the more likely the vehicle to hydroplane, the harder the steering
effort while parking and turning sharp corners.  With a taller tire, the
effective axle ratio is steepened.  This decreases the acceleration and
passing power considerably.  Taller tires also handle more softly and
sluggishly, giving that &quot;detached&quot; driving sensation.

Sumitomo also makes an 8-ply light truck tire for about $110.00 each.  I've
never seen these, and can't make a recommendation.  These are supposed to be
used with light trucks and vans instead of passenger car tires.  I don't work
for Sumitomo, own stock, owe them money, etc.  I just like their product.  I
don't think that they make a raised white letter tire.
