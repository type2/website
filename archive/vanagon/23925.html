Well, Hallelujah!!

The eagle has landed!

We have met the enemy and he is ours!

(Insert other appropriate celebratory phrase here)

RE the '71 bus that was overheating and spewing occasional
opaque clouds of white smoke:

I disconnected the vacuum line that goes forward to the power brake
servo, and lo and behold, brake fluid came pouring out! Boy, does
that stuff do a job on engine compartment paint.

Cleaned it up, sucked on it cautiously, and it felt like the other end
was simply open to the sky. Well, no wonder the idle-air was screwed
down so much. Geez, I wonder what my valves look like about now...

Stuffed a paper towel into the vacuum line, capped the manifold tap,
fired it up, adjusted the idle, and suddenly it runs like a swiss
watch. Solid  idle, except for the idle stop screw keeps turning by
itself (anyone know how to fix that on a 30PICT-3?). Drove it to work
this morning (boy are those non-power disc brakes STIFF), no smoke
of any color, engine never conked out once at stop signs. And when I
arrived at my destination, the bus did NOT smell hot!!! For the first
time in a long time. Next, a freeway trip!

Ordered a new Master Cyl from  Kragen/Checker, $40.99 plus core,
lifetime warranty (I know, that means you'll spend a lifetime replacing
it). They don't have Brake Servo rebuild kits, or new servos-- I'll
check the VW houses around here. May or may not need it anyway, tho
that open-feeling line bugs me bigtime.

It's probably idling rich right now, since one of its air &quot;sources&quot;
has now been capped. That won't hurt it for a while-- when I get
the new M/C in and maybe the servo rebuilt, I'll set it up.

Boy, I'd almost forgotten how smooth VWs can be.

Thanks again for all your help, ladies and gents of the list.
Couldn't have done it without your sage advice and insight!
