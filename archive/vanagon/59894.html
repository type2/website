&gt;Has anyone ever tried placing the headlights in the oven (at low temp) to
&gt;bake out the moisture?

I tried it but it didn't work very well.
Mind you, this was on the rectangular headlight on a '90, but the internal
volume is similar.
I was doing this because I was repairing a rock ding with clear epoxy (to
seal the assembly) and wanted to dry out all of the accumulated rainwater
first. (Eventually wound up buying a new headlight housing - OUCH! -
$161.US at the dealer.)

What I found to work better at drying out the housing was a hair dryer,
blown through the opening where the bulb goes.
The air exchange rate increased the drying rate.

If you put it in the oven you have to heat it to a little over 212F to get
any reasonable rate of drying.
