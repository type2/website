&gt; Hi all
&gt; 
&gt; I may be dropping my engine soon and in following oher threads there
&gt; does seem to be a problem with petrol fumes getting into the cab from
&gt; a perished pipe near the petrol tank.
&gt; 
&gt; Could someone tell me how the job is done and which pipe I should be
&gt; looking to replace.
&gt; 

You can't do it without getting the engine out of the way. I found a
small rubber hose on my 73 that was easily replaced once the engine was
out.
