Subject: Smells like Gas

The interior of my 79 smells like gasoline fumes.  It is a daily driver,
and I noticed it about 3 days ago.  It only smells like gasoline on the 
inside of the van, not in the engine compartment.  While driving, the smell
is more obvious.  I did a pretty good inspection of the engine compartment
and the fuel pump.  No leaks turned up!!!1
The only things that I've done different to the car in the last week are
park it on a weird incline which it is not used to, and also drive on 
the highway at a constant 60mph.  Before this I would drive a 
constant 55mph.
The car did this once after I added fuel injector cleaner awhile back, 
but when I refilled the tank, the odor left.  I refilled the tank 
this afternoon , and drove for awhile.  same smell.  i parked and opened all
the windows and let sit for 3 hrs.  Came back and same gasoline odor
with no visible leaks.

Any ideas/suggestions
This is weird and kind of scary.

Thanks
