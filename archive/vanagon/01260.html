Subject: ceramic coating exhaust components

After reading many postings regarding the high cost of exhaust components
for a 1987 Vanagon, I doubt that I will ever consider owning one. 

But an idea did occur to me that might help those of you who like and enjoy
your late model Vanagons.  After spending a mint on various exhaust
components, why not get them cermaic coated?  Several years ago I received a 
sales brochure from a company called, Jet-Hot Coatings.  This company
specializes in applying metallic-ceramic coatings to automotive parts.  This 
aluminum-ceramic coating vastly improves corrosion resistance, high
temperature fatigue resistance, and high temperature oxidation resistance.
The coating was developed for use in jet fighter engines (for high
temperature/pressure applications) and submarines (for corrosion
resistance). 

I do not know what their current rates are, but several years ago they
offered to coat my heat exchangers (Bug engine) for $150 each. 

If you are interested, call for a free brochure at  1-800-432-3379.
They advertise in Hemmings Motor News.

P.S.  I am not affiliated with these guys in any way.  If anyone has had any 
experience with ceramic coatings, please share them with us.  Jet-Hot might
not be the one and only alternative.
