&gt;Sounds like a '60 to me, which would correspond to 612483.
&gt;I think '60 was the last year for the bullet front turn signals,
&gt;and the number 672483 would be later than '60 - according to 
&gt;the NEATO data at http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/chassis.html

Tom F,

  Bullet indicators finished in '62 but 612483 would definatly
make this bus a '60.
