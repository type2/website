Subject: Re: Center Console

I must admit that I thought of building a short center console for tool
storage, but I'm sure not married to the idea. I too really appreciate the
walk-through feature...and I have many more important things to do to the
bus before I spend time weighing the pros and cons of a center console. I
also thought of mounting my spare tire up front and using the tire well for
tool storage...too much cabinet space is being eaten up by spare parts and
tools.
