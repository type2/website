Subject: Re: Moo is leaking Big Time!

If your water pump went, coolant will most likely leak from the shaft of the
water pump.  You will probably be able to hear the bearings whining and coolant
will be spraying all over the inside of the engine compartment due to the
centripetal (sp?, not centrifugal) force of the rotation of the shaft of the
pump.

I think that pumps fail gradually more oft than not.  Have you noticed coolant
leaking before?  I think you really gotta find out where it's leaking from.
 Watch out for coolant getting in your eyes.

Sorry, but that's the limit of my knowledge.  I'm sure other members will help
more.

Good luck............

&gt; Hello All!   Moo, my 88 Westy has a collant leak.  here's the guff.  I
&gt; took her for her last run of the winter/fall a week ago.  800 klicks no
&gt; sweat.  I parked the camper and didn't start her for A week.  I started
&gt; it up last night and after the initial &quot;test&quot; blink, the flashing red
&gt; light started to blink and wouldnt stop.
&gt; The coolant tank was empty...  I refilled, started, and the same thing.
&gt;
&gt; I just came in, after letting the engine warm up to the point where the
&gt; indicator was at the midway point.  I had a look underneath the engine
&gt; and coolant was leaking at a radip rate from the right side of the
&gt; engine. FIF.
&gt;
&gt; Could a bum water pump be the problem?  How can I tell ?  what should I
&gt; look for?
&gt;
&gt; Help please!!
