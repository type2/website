Subject: Disconnect O-2 sensor&gt;&gt;Digifant II: Son of Digifant? Tell Me More

&gt; ======== Fwd by: Don Gibbons ========
&gt; When I had my syncro (and idle problems) I once took apart the ECU. I have
&gt; access to PROM copy and programming equip and thought that I could do some
&gt; changes. What I found was this: the processor chip is a very primitive 8 bit
&gt; unit with no provision for memory. This means that it can not &quot;learn&quot; the
&gt; engine or remember fault codes. There is no place to store the codes anyway.
&gt; And the PROM is soldered in. All this led me in a different direction:
&gt; Digifant II. The ECU's in golfs, jetta II are an updated system and while it
&gt; shares the same 8 bit brain as digifant I it has many other improvments. And
&gt; if you study the wiring for both cars the digifant II ECU will plug into the
&gt; vanagon and run with very minor changes.
Don, Volks,
Please clarify, Will a Digifant II ECU run the EFI on my 87GL -AND
record Fault Codes-? What if any alteration (you mentioned -very minor-
changes, please expand/define) to the ECU plug/pinouts may be necessary. 
Volks, this could be revolutionary. Be still my heart! Can this be
true?  Please tell me 'tis so, and specifically which Digifant II ECU
(is there only one Digifant II in the series) that will work on a
Vanagon. 
And yes my heart is still set on a Subagon (or Vanaru), but I now have
thoughts that my Japanese marriage aspirations for my Vanagon may not be
as time conscience as before.

Or: Give Me Fault Codes Man!
