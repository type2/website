Subject: Re:Pole Vaulting a Van

I recently took a very hard look at a Riata.  The graywater outlet ran
downward toward the front of the vehicle with a clearance of less than nine
inches at the end.  It looked like a good candidate for pole vaulting when
driving over a speed bump.  Jim McCarthy
&gt;If you fasten a safety strap under the drive shaft toward the front
&gt;universal joint, you can eliminate pole vaulting as a worry.
