&gt; Um, by the way:
&gt;  I don't own the store or know anyone that works there.  (I used to know
&gt; a cashier there but she works somewhere else now.  Besides, I didn't even
&gt; like her that much.  I was friends with her boyfriend who I'm really not
&gt; that tight with anymore either.)

Was her sister bitten by a moose once?

Sorry, non-Python people, couldn't resist.   :)
