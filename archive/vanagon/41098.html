Subject: VANAGON REAR HATCH STRUTS

with all the talk of these things and given my need for them [ouch:)], 
does anybody know anything about this place:

Mark
Adirondack Auto Brokers
e-mail: markaab_at_global1_dot_net

he says he carries new OEM units for $25.00 each, says they are 
&quot;Stabilis&quot; brand made by Fichtal &amp; Sachs in Germany and that they are 
the original equipment.

ps- thanks for the advice on the voltage stabilizer!
