&gt; &gt;In fact, the real bitch of this Microsoft gateway is I dont get to

&gt; &gt;able to read articles based on who wrote them. So I would tune in when 
&gt; those
&gt; &gt;I respected has something to say regardless of the topic.

&gt; &gt;The evil Bill Gates should be forced to fix his software
&gt; &gt;or at least forced to use it. Flee the mail gateway tyranny
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Well, not sure he's evil, or even his company. They've put out an
&gt; awful lot of popular, useful (note that I didn't say &quot;perfect&quot;)
&gt; software, and kept the company afloat well enough to back it up and
&gt; make more.
&gt; 
&gt; If he were to fold the company, close the doors, and throw 70,000
&gt; people out of work from the jobs he created for them, as well as
&gt; delivering a huge hit to every software distributor and store in
&gt; the free world and leave ALL his zillions of customers in the lurch...
&gt; that's what I would call evil. Or at least stupid.

&gt; The guy's not perfect, and neither is his software. But until
&gt; something better comes along, I'll use his stuff to get the job done,
&gt; because it does that quite well.
SNIP
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck, all...

ARRRRGH a disciple of the Anti-Christ!

&quot;WE ARE Microsoft, resistance is irrelevant. You will be assimilated&quot;

I am Happy to say that my Macintoshes are Microsoft free!
There are no more MS programs that are useful to me on the Mac!

My Volkswagen Bus is now completely MS free as well.(just to stay on topic)
