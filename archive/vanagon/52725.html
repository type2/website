Subject: Synchro Westy ('90) vibration update

Thanks for the excellent tips contained in previous replys!

Turns out the front u-joint is almost broken, causing vibrations.  This 
leads to new questions.  I've heard you can buy the u-joint separately, 
anyone have info on where?  Also, since the driveshaft and both 
u-joints are meant to be an integrated system, how do you change out 
just one u-joint?
