&gt; Dave, 
&gt; I have done the water pump on my 84 Vanagon and there were not any major
&gt; problems.   Before replacing the gaskets run a flat stone across the face
&gt; of the two surfaces to make sure they are flat.   There is one trick
&gt; though,  and that is filling up the cooling system afterwards.   It takes
&gt; two people - one to keep the rev's up and one to put in water and close
the
&gt; vent hole in the radiator.  Someone told me to jack up the front of the
van
&gt; at least 18&quot; (to help the air get to the vent).
&gt; While we are on the subject I have at times been driving on the freeway
and
&gt; had the needle peg and the light blink at me.   This happens without
&gt; warning (the needle goes from center to far right in a matter of
seconds). 
&gt;  If I pull to the side of the road and  wait for a minute, everything is
&gt; fine.  
&gt; Maybe my filling tactics are not totally correct.
&gt; Might there be air in the line?   Anyone had the same problem?
