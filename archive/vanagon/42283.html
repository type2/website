&gt;I'm getting ready to put a new clutch into my '68 Camper.  I see 
&gt;several different prices listed in the mail-order catalogs with 
&gt;the German parts costing almost twice as much as the Brazilian 
&gt;stuff.
&gt;
&gt;Has anybody had any experience using the Brazilian.  What is the 
&gt;major differences to look for?  Why would I be better off to 
&gt;spend the extra money - or would I.
&gt;
&gt;Any input will be appreciated.

I've used both.  I think the German uses a better lining material and the hub
looks stronger.  I've also seen and used discs made in china.  Had one blow
apart at the hub but I suspect a bad pilot bearing caused the failure.
