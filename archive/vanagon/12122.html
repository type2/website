Subject: Micro-bus option numbers

     Hi all,
     
     Now I've checked out all the usuall literature on the 'M' options and 
     there is no info. on my 'M' numbers and my mate (Danny) has six 
     numbers of which only one can be found.
     
     Does any one have a full list of all the M options, or know where one 
     is, or has had the same trouble id'ing their options.
     
     puzzled  :[
