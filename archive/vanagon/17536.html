Subject: Re: Gastester(schon wieder!)

I whiled away 1.5 afternoons this weekend doing the O2-sensor-as-mixture-
tester trick.  Paid $45 for generic three-wire O2 sensor, $25 for cheapest
Radio Shack DVM.  Wired so I could power the heater leads from the cigarette
lighter, and see the voltage display as I drove.

As I had read posts about the idea, I had pictured sticking the sensor into
the tailpipe (eg on a copper pipe to protect the wiring) but with sensor in
hand I realized this won't work:  pigtail end of sensor must be in outside
air for it to work.  I tapped the sensor into a pipe that is a press fit
into my tailpipe.  

Very educational to watch the display.  &quot;Sweet spot&quot; setting of mixture
(on 77 CIS engine) is very narrow and has nothing to do with best (ie
stoichiometric) setting at idle.  I can't imagine pulling the plugs often
enough to get it right without a tester that can go on the road.  Does this
match the experience of others -- that CIS system is rich at idle in order
to be neither rich nor lean at speed?  Or do I need to install clean plugs
and try again?
