Subject: ?Window Blinds

Hi All,

Yesterday while I was taking my usual nap over lunch in my 86 Syncro
I was wondering if anyone has ever installed a set of custom, retractable
blinds in their vans.  It could be attached along the bottom of the back
and side windows with a little hook on the top of the window for a quick
window covering for sleeping.  Just a thought.  The back window would need
to be tappered off towards the top to cover the window properly.
Presently I have some homemade curtains that work ok, but are a hassle for
the back window and the side door.  The PO made screens for the side
windows that are held on magnetically.  They work pretty good for keeping
the 'critters' out.

Has anyone tried the blinds approach for window covering?
