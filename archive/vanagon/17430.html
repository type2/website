Jeff (potential bus butcher),
(Kidding) Dude you deserve gas in the face! Man, don't cut the bus!!!

I am a member of the gas in the face, LAST one to leave the Escondido SOTO
show last year (miss the caravan up to the Classic with 200 bitchen buses)
because of a leaky fuel tank bib in the 57 single cab, replacement with a
full tank rat smelling no shower for 200 miles cigarette smoking afterwards
trapped in a single cab with a hysterical (I gotta find a bathroom) wife club.

Has anyone seen, used, heard anything positive about additional air
ventilation for the engine comp. on an aircooled in the following manner-
Holes cut through body, sides of engine compartment to be exact, 
with air &quot;scoops&quot; to usher in cool air?

NO!!!!!! How many buses have I seen that were pretty cherry except for the
damned air scoop cut out senario???? How many times have I cursed the dude
that did it? Millions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I am considering a road trip from here (Seattle) this summer 
&gt;through Baja (about 5,000 miles round trip), and would think this might 
&gt;help circulation... 

Face it, in southern calif, arizona, new mexico, and old mexico when it's
hot, it's butt hot and nothing like the scoop will make enough difference as
to justify cutting the bus. No matter what year it is. Buy and install a dog
house oil cooler, an external oil cooler, temp gauge, pull over and let 'er
rest/cool down (let momma pee) Don't cut the bus especially since it's a
camper. Oh it's a '78? Cut the SOB!!!

Only kidding. Really, Don't cut it.
