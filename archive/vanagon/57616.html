Subject: Eurobagoes, Winnies, or what?

List members seem to delect in using &quot;cool&quot; names
for their car models: Westies, Winnies, Wasserboxers,
Weekenders, etc.  When this insider jargon is picked up
by the list members, it may confuse the newcomers.  Maybe
we need a dictionnary in the archives.  Joel Walker, as one
of the founding fathers of the list, would you care to
volunteer to be its keeper?

I'll take the credit or blame, whichever, for having
started Eurobago = Eurovan + Winnebago in a private mail 
to Dan Herbert, at the time when he needed help and sympathy
on his cracked roof problem.  By now the term has been
used in 11 posts (keyword search in the 1997 archives); 
there are also 17 appearance of the equivalent term EV Winnie, 
as opposed to EV Westy = EV + Westfalia.

I count some 12 owners of the 95 Eurovan Winebago Camper on the
list, but many more recent lookers. Anybody care to make some
baptismal comments?
