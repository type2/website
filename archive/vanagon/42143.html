THats why I always get pictures first.

I don't even bother with busses that purport to have nice rims, etc,
because I know they are probably trash.  Especially in Southern Cal.

Your best bet was to have someone try and go look at it.

Also, you should have made it clear on the phone or when you sent the 
deposit that you wanted it refundable if you didn't like the car.  If
he could have sold it 10 times, then he should have no problem selling
it quickly.
