Subject: vanagon for sale want a 71

hi all ive decided to sell my 86 vanagon. my brother sold his 71 westi and i
wanted it, but no,he sold it to someone else. now i want my own. my wife
told me that 6 cars was my limit and so the vanagon is the first to go. i
would also entertain trades, but first ill list what i know about this beast.
***first the good stuff***
86 vanagon gl 7 passanger
2100cc waterboxer (no leaks -oil or coolant)
compression is within specs
no exhaust leaks, runs good with no problems 
new plugs wires car rotor,air filter,front brakes,rotors,wheel
bearings,races,front end alignment and tire balance.
no rust on underbody or on exterior. only in MI 1 year thats why no rust
new axle boots on cv joints,cv joints inspected and good
sliding door slides like new
new windsheild
new rear hatch shocks 
new bently manual the expensive one
tires in good shape

***the bad stuff***
rear wiper does not work
front blower fan squeeks but runs threw all the speeds 
fair share of small dents on rear and booth rear sides
no rear bumper (i do have it but its bent up)no damage to motor area
rear pass. compartment heater smells like its leaking(planing to repair)no
lose in coolant
clutch master cylinder needs to be bled.( still shifts threw all the gears
without a problem)

***misc. stuff to know***

drives and handles well
have a few extra parts (little stuff)

price- $ 2650.00 or best offer

if interested e-mail me at strtbug_at_ibm_dot_net

or if are willing to trade let me know maybe we can work something out.what
i really want is a 71 std bus with sunroof or a 71 panel van. must be rust
free like my vanagon. also i live in michigan.
 later Jonce
56 single cab
66 bug
66 squareback
86 vanagon
92 jetta
94 probe wifes car

p.s. i also have a 1900cc water boxer i bought for 175.00 that i was told it
ran but i dont know. i found out it was a 1900 after i bought it used and i
had no use for it. so 175.00 takes it. it also has an alt. still on it.i
havent played with it to find out anything but as it sits it doesnt turn over.
