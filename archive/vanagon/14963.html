Subject: Re: Recall / Heads??

&gt;I wonder if their has been any recall or tech bulletin or other unusual 
&gt;policies or offers by VW regarding heads, because:
&gt;
&gt;My local VW dealer service dept. just determined that my head gaskets are 
&gt;goners, and are checking for any related problems, like condition of the 
&gt;heads now. Interestingly, they offered to contact VW regarding having 
&gt;them pay for 50% to 80% of my costs on this problem. I appreciate their 
&gt;offer but now wonder if they're doing it because of some problem or 
&gt;obligation they're aware of or if I'm sort of a special case.

I've been talking with a couple of VW mechanics in Vermont who tell me that
VW has been paying 80% of head gasket repairs.  (Which they tell me can run
up to $3000.)

If there is any information on this, I'd also be interested in hearing it,
as I'm looking into buying a '90 Syncro Camper up there.

Ron
