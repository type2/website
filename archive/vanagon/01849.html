Subject: on cost benefit


(regarding post on CVs repacking vs replacing)

If you are going to do a full blown cost analysis, then it never pays
go to the dealer unless you make (in my area) $45*(tax rate) does it?

Of course if you cant do the operationin question it may become worth
it - my experience has been that people really undersell themselves on
what they can and cant do - quick cure for this is to sit in the dealer
(esp VW) and listen to the knuckles scraping on the ground as the 
mechanics 'walk' by.

With a good source of tech info (bentley) and  a good source of practical
info (this list  for example) most anything is covered.

I run a fully-depreciated third car so that I can deal with any problems
between the two daily drivers with an hour after dinner, taking as money
(sorry, many) days as it takes to get the job done.

Costs me about $300 extra on insurance (thanks upstate NY) which I 
usually recover in about 2 or 3 months of NOT mechanics bills.
