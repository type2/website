I am looking at a jug right now and it is phosphate free, however I found
out yesterday that I need to replace my flange.  It is dropping a few
drips every once and a while from the nut and on the flange.  Is the
flange plastic?  I have been using Sierra for two years, could the Sierra
have caused it? Thanks for all the help.

&gt; &gt; As I recall, it's phosphate free, but I'll look at the bottle when I get
&gt; &gt; home.  I used to put it in a Honda.
