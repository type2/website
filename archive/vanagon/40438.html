Subject: Assembling pistons &amp; cylinders


&gt;I sprayed the cylinders with WD-40 before using the ring compresser... 

To All:

WD-40 is handy stuff around the shop but it is basically kerosene.  And
kerosene isn't a very good assembly lubricant.

Before installing our pistons into the cylinders, wipe the cylinder bore with
a good coat of straight-weight motor oil, either 30W or 40W.  Be sure the
entire surface of the bore is coated with oil.  Don't overdo it.  Too much
oil will defeat the sealant you'll be applying to the base of the cylinders;
sealant works best applied to a clean, oil-free surface.

Grease of various kinds is used as an assembly lubricant on the engine's
bearings, which can deal with the small amount of grease, but cylinders must
be oiled -- the piston rings were not designed to deal with grease.

Before installing the piston rings, oil the grooves into which they go.  The
tops &amp; bottoms of the grooves are sealing surfaces and must be covered by a
film of lubricant when the engine is first started.

After having a couple of start-up failures, some mechanics over-react and
literally soak the assembled piston in a can of oil before installing it in
the jug.  This prevents dry starts but is far too messy and that messiness
can lead to other problems.  Your jugs only need about a teaspoonful of oil
to do their thing at start-up time but it has to be in the right places.

I've made this a general post because it is the second instance of someone
using WD-40 as an assembly lubricant. Like I said, WD-40 is handy (and a nice
stock to own!) but don't fall in love with it.  A flit gun filled with
kerosene will do the same job, and has for the last hundred years.
