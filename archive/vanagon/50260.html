Subject: Coolant Replaced with non-VW brand

Hi everyone!

I just replaced the coolant, but I think I made a boo-boo... I used
Prestone rather than the VW-recommended Autobahn brand coolant...  I'm
thinking gosh... I gotta do that whole thing over again?!  I might as
well have gone to the dealer (well maybe not ;-).  

Question:  Anyone else not using the VW-recommended coolant?  Any
problems with not following the VW recommendation?
