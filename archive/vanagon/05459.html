Subject: Re: Aux. heater questions.

This really isn't about Aux. Heater Questions anymore, but our Vax system
still isn't quite right and I can't edit the &quot;Subj&quot; line...

The 65 Campmobile was snatched up by a Jr. Deadhead while I was busy being 
indecisive.  This kid paid the guy $200 more than he was asking, and since
I hadn't paid anything, there it went.  C'est la vie.  The $ is better put
er put

This screwy Vax mess is going to make me crazy real soon.

Ahem.  The $ is better put into the &quot;Paint the 68 &amp; Make the Body
Beautiful&quot; fund I suppose...

BTW Ackworth, Iowa is about 175 miles north of Kansas City &amp; 35 mi. east.
