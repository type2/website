You're absolutely right.

&gt; a) Are there black ones available?

Actually, as it says on the web site, the fenders Helmut is arranging are
BLACK.

&gt; b) What exactly are they made of?....plastic or rubber??

Good question.

&gt; c) How exactly do they attach?

Good question.

&gt; d) Where can we see a picture/ read a description of them?

http://www.vanagon_dot_com/ (Click on 'Info', then 'Fender Lips'.)

&gt; e) How long do they tend to last?

Hmmm.  Depends if you're Derek Drew, probably.

&gt; d) Has anyone done business with Zeidler successfully before?? &gt;&gt;

Yup!  ('d' again?)
