&gt;      Bill Killian has documented how well his EV did in the recent
&gt;      snows we've had, here is how the Syncro Westie fared:

&gt;      Acquired in August, this was our first time in significant snow.

First 'significant' snow in this area in years...

&gt;      Diff lock on, I put it in first (the granny gear) and proceeded up at
&gt;      a stately pace, running 3000 RPM. It was anticlimatic, really, we
&gt;      just went up the hill...until we came to the &quot;windrow&quot; of snow across
&gt;      the street at the top, where it intersected with a well-plowed main
&gt;      drag. We went into the icebreaker &quot;back and ram&quot; mode, and on
&gt;      the third try got onto the flat and level. The plow followed me!

His snow was worse than mine.  I do still have syncro-envy...

&gt;      Got to get those chains for the LT27x8.5x14 AT tires.  Stores do not
&gt;      carry chains around here, and  JC Whipme offers a whole variety in
&gt;      sizes matched to specific tire sizes, but does not mention my tire.
&gt;      Their order-takers were not helpful. Any ideas what size chain to buy?

I hate chains.  Really suck when the roads are half plowed dry and half 
barely plowed.
