&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Also make sure the oil level is proper - not empty (since you're leaking) 
&gt;&gt; and not too full, since that will put extra pressure on the seal (or
&gt;&gt; what's left of it...)
&gt;
&gt;How much trans. oil should be in there? I was always told to fill it
&gt;until the level was even with the filler hole on the side. Is this too
&gt;much? If so, how does one tell how much to put in?
&gt;

According to the the Gospel of St. Muir, 8:12 (ok, I made that up)
that is the proper way to do it.  Make sure the *bus* is level, tho.
