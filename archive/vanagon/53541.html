Subject: Cracked Winshield Glass Q's

List,

	Over beers, my friends and I were debating how glass repair companies
fix small cracks and stone chips on auto glass. (we have too much free
time!) Anyway, I was wondering if any list members know of the
techniques used and could relate them to the list. It could come in
handy knowing to what extent VW glass can be fixed.
	Our conscenses was something between a type of penetrant, (like WD40)
and some level of heat. But what do we know, we were drunk. 
	Also, If Derek is reading this, I'm still trying to track down my
source for viscious fluid we talked about.
	Thanks in advance and have a great new year everyone!
