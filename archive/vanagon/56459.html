Subject: Radiator Fan Ballast resistor harness 


My radiator fan was not working on the low speed. The problem was
diagnosed as the ballast resistor behind the driver's headlight.

So I ordered one from Camelback and it arrived in a timely fashion and
at a better price than the local dealer.

But, it also had a another ballast resistor and they were connected to
a wiring harness. I was expecting just the resistor.

Should I replace the entire harness, or can I just take the resistor
off the harness and use it on the old harness?
