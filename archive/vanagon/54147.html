Subject: coolant crossover pipe

I am replacing a leaking crossover coolant pipe flange--a leaking plastic
(nylon?) fitting with the metal replacement. This is the 90 degree flange
below the alternator on my '89 Westy. My wife picked up the part for me and
I was unable to question the parts guys about this--the gasket supplied
with the flange is rather hard, not the type of gasket material I'm used to
seeing in water applications and since I generally don't like using
silicones and such junk on gaskets, is this thing going to leak if I
install it as is?
