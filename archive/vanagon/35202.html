Subject: Re: Subaru 2.2 in Vanagon?

I have been trying to keep in touch with a non-listmember who is putting a
Subaru in his vanagon, he wrote this to me about the transplant.

&gt;Kennedy Engineered products has a &quot;KIT&quot; for the transplant. you DO have to
&gt;have a complete subaru engine, wiring harness, and a LOT of other parts. It
&gt;WOULD be the same cost to do your engine over...that said the Suby has 135
&gt;HP, the parts cost less, and it is fuel injected also.I assume the 150 HP
&gt;newest model will mount the same, so here is where to contact them.

&gt;Hello all
&gt;
&gt;I have been reading for a couple of days so I feel I can put both feet in 
&gt;without cause for concern.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone put a Subaru Legacy (I think? Called Liberty here) 2.2 boxer 
&gt;in a Vanagon?
&gt;
&gt;It &quot;looks&quot; the same yet produces 100kw (130 bhp) on unleaded 89 octane. 
&gt;In Aussie we can get a low milage Japanese import for around $1200 Aus
&gt; ($900 US.)
&gt;
&gt;I haven't found any hard specs but I have been toying with the idea.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone had any experiences??
