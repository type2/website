Subject: Cal Look Vanagon

Well I don't want to open up a can of worms here but, last week I removed 
the plastic silver (orange yucky) trim around the windshield and rear 
window and cleaned the rubber and wow what a difference. 

Instead of looking at my Vanagon and thinking &quot;Oh that trim looks bad!&quot;, 
now I think &quot;Wow, why didn't I do that before?&quot;

The rubber is healing up nicely. The opening left from the trim is 
completely closed up in most areas and is not noticeable from a distance 
and it REALLY looks better. I may pull it off the side windows next but 
then I might be inclined to do something (like paint) the chrome around 
the front door window and the sliders in the middle and that's more work 
than I can tackle at the moment.

BTW, for those who posted about this earlier, the windows haven't fallen 
out and I don't think that doing this will cause them to. 

Also BTW, I have the bumpers off. They have been blasted and are now in 
the process of being primed and painted Satin Black. They look GREAT!

Peace,
