Trip Narrative:

Departed Vista, California about 1000 Wednesday heading north on
I-5.

The trip had four general goals.  The first was to visit my son
in Modesto, the second was a shake-down run for the tranny and
overhauled outboard gearboxes, installed just prior to departure. 
The third was to canvas junk yards in the the Central Valley for
Thing parts that could be used on an IRS-conversion on an early
bus.  The last goal was to attend a gathering of Vanagon-list
subscribers to be held at Pfeiffer-Big Sur State Park.

I traveled north to the vicinity of Bakersfield where I visited a
number of auto-recyling yards on Union Avenue.  No joy finding
Things but I was told there were 'several' Type 181's in a fenced
yard in Maricopa.  Drove there, arrived about sundown.  Weather
had been exceptionally good all day with clear skies and mild
temps.  Fantastic display of lenticular clouds over the Sierra-
Nevada mountains.

Maricopa, with a declared population of 1,245, had apparently
suffered a serious decline since the last census.  I ate supper
at Kathleen's Kitchen where I pestered the patrons with questions
about Volkswagen Things, resorting to making a sketch of one to
jog their memories.  Properly jogged, they all agreed they'd seen
such things but never in Maricopa, although they directed me to a
fenced yard that contained a Type III station wagon, and to an
unoccupied house that had a '68 Type II behind it.  Several of
the patrons were pretty sure the fenced-yard I sought was in one
of the towns farther north along Highway 33.

I spent the night in the bus, parked in the center of Maricopa
accompanied by a couple of big-rigs, using the deserted gas
station as an RV park.  The restaurant is next door to the
abandoned gas station, making it handy for truckers.  It also
made it handy to tap the telephone lead going to the pay phone
with lineman clips, allowing me to do a FlashMail session... if I
had really wanted to.  

Thursday, I meandered north on Hwy 33.  Somewhere between
McKittrick and Blackwell's Corners the bus began to hiss at me. 
A propane cylinder had become wedged against the heater duct
under the rear seat and become so hot it blew out the pressure
relief valve, filling the bus with propane gas.  I ditched the
bus and bailed out while it was still moving.  When the thing
didn't blow up, I crept back and opened the cargo doors.  By then
the propane had formed a defintely explosive mixture.  I fished
my tools and jack out from under the seat, terrified of making a
spark, until I could get a grip on the gas cylinder.  I tossed it
out of the bus where it hissed a merry plume of propane while I
aired out the cargo bay.  It was still hissing at me when I drove
away.

At Avenal a trucker directed me to a 'whole bunch' of VW Things
at a junkyard in Clovis, north of Fresno.  I back-tracked to Hwy
41 and headed for Fresno, stopping to look at a breadloaf I
spotted near Lemoore.  

Clovis turned out to be a bust.  Everyone knew there were a bunch
of Things real close by but no one could provide any first-hand
information.  I ran out of daylight before completing my quest
and decided to head back toward the coast.  Being some distance
north of Fresno, I used county roads to get back to I-5 and spent
the night at the rest stop south of Coalinga.

Friday morning I explored the area around Coalinga for junkyards
and veedubs, finally heading over toward the coast on Hwy 198. 
Beautiful country.  The weather had closed down and the clouds
hugged the hilltops, with occasional rays of sunlight
illuminating the hidden valleys.  Traffic was almost non-existant
on the picturesque but seldom-traveled road.  Saw cowboys
rounding up cattle using Austrailian Heelers.  Stopped to watch. 
One man on horseback, one man in a truck, and two dogs neatly
gathered up about eighty cattle in less than ten minutes.  The
dogs returned to the truck on command, leaping onto the flatbed. 
Driven around the herd, they would leap off and harry strays out
of the brush, bringing them back to the herd.  My first
experience seeing dogs work cattle in California.  The dogs
looked very pleased with themselves.  

I came down from the hills at San Lucas to discover it had lost
it's freeway.  It used to be on Highway 101 but the new four-lane
highway is about a mile to west, isolating the town.  It still ha
its Post Office, general store, school and church, but the grain
elevators appeared abandoned and the gas station is gone.  

On the road connecting San Lucas to the highway I came upon a
Chevy with the hood up, a distraught woman standing alongside
hugging herself against the chill wind.  I didn't see the two
kids in the car until I'd stopped.

She didn't know what was wrong, she said it had just died.  It
was her sister's car.   She had run down the battery trying to
start it.  It had fuel and everything appeared normal but jumping
it with my spare battery produced no spark.  I gave her a lift
into King City, dropping her at a station with a tow truck out
front.  It was about three in the afternoon.

I stopped at a taco stand and cleaned up the bus, putting the
spare battery back in its place and straightening up a minor mess
made by the kids, who had ridden in back.  Going back to the
freeway, I saw the lady huddled by the pay-phone at the station. 
Her Chevy was there but outside of the shop with the kids in the
backseat.  I stopped and asked how things had gone and got a
confused story about the car's electronic module being fried and
no spare available until Monday and she had to be to work
tomorrow and they were really her sister's kids and she couldn't
reach her...  She was close to tears and I offered her a lift to
her sister's place which turned out to be in Coyote, a town near
San Jose, about a hundred miles north.

I had some Hersey's miniture chocolates in my tucker box and
doled them out to the kids to keep them quiet.  The woman became
increasingly nervous as the trip progressed, worried about
'payment' for the ride and the form it might take.  She was
Hispanic, outwardly very self-assured but uncomfortable with my
silences.

We got to Coyote only to find no one at home.  The woman was now
very nervous, partly from my warning the children not to play
with the explosives in the black bags.  My tools are in a pair of
black tool bags but the mild joke was taken seriously.  The rest
of the trip was remarkably quiet.  I drove the woman to a second
address and we found the sister there.  Happy ending for all; the
sister even offered me $10 for delivering the goods.  I took it.

Heading back south, I got as far as Salinas before I crashed for
the night in a parking lot.  The next morning I broke my fast
with a Granny Smith apple which proved to be a big mistake. 
Since leaving home I'd been bothered by a minor gum infection.
The tough skin of the apple became lodged in a permanent bridge
at the site of the infection and I couldn't deal with it without
a water pick or the proper tools.  Poking at it with my pipe
tamper didn't help although it did tear up the gum nicely.

After eating a handful of Tylenol I drove to Carmel, hung a left
and pulled into the State Park about 1030.  I enjoyed the company
of the group, along with a hot shower.  I ate a cautious can of
soup for lunch but the gum disliked Mr. Campbell as much as
Granny Smith so I shifted to a diet of rum in a coffee cup, which
I consumed steadily for the remainder of the day.  I hung around
until after the fireworks then took off for Modesto.  Sunday, I
made a quick trip home, arriving about 2130.

Conclusions:  

The tranny and gearbox installation, while a bit noisy, is
working properly.

Based on wind-wander and driver fatigue, it's time to rebuild the
front-end.  

The 'cow-pie' insulation works and will be applied to the
remainder of the ceiling.  

The sliding windows need to be rebuilt.  There is an annoying
wind-whistle and draft at anything over 60 mph.  

The cargo-area heater duct is the perfect place to heat a can of
soup.  

Much of Highway 198 does not have cellular telephone access.

I used a blade-type fuse for the cooling fan circuit... but
forgot to add spares to my kit.

Never eat a Granny Smith apple unless you've got some way to
clean the debris out of your bridgework.

Never feed kids a pound of chocolate if you expect them to be
quiet.

Don't allow David or Bradley near anything made of magnesium.
