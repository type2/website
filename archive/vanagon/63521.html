Subject: RE: A Stretching Clutch Cable?

Erik,

The boden tube has a female end (chassis side) and a male end
(transmission side).  

The female end slides over the clutch tube in the chassis and the male end
slips into a bracket that is bolted to the top of the side covers of the
transmission.  

The tension between these two points creates the angle in the tube and
also holds it in place.  There should not be any other brackets.  I have
had a case where the clutch tube rotted away at the end and the boden tube
at the chassis end was not secure.

I would recommend removing the boden tube and examine the clutch tube.  If
it does not stick out beyond the chassis to slip over the boden tube you
will have to replace the clutch tube or figure a way to extend the clutch
tube.  If you can clean up the clutch tube by trimming it and If enough of
the boden tube extends beyond the trans-bracket you can also make up the
angle and tension by slipping washers (big) over the male end and
reinstalling the tube and the cable (as a unit you will have to muscle
it).  If the boden tube is broken/bent or to small you will have to
replace it.  If the stock boden is not long enough (if you chosen to
trim the clutch tube) The beetle tubes came in many different lengths and
may fit.

Rember, to grease the cable and remove/install the boden and clutch cable
as a unit.

Good Luck,
Dan

&gt; Yeah, there is a flex tube under there and the bracket that holds it to
&gt; the car looks broken, someone's put a clamp around it to hold the tube
&gt; against the car.  Dan, you're a kind man--this must be it!  
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From the looks of it, the little bracket is welded on one side to the
&gt; car and the other end the boden tube is held by it, but the bracket it
&gt; broken in between where it is welded to the car body and where it holds
&gt; the tube.  Is this as simple as getting it welded?  Seems like there'd
&gt; be a lot of tension on the bracket, it's a pretty whimpy lookin' little
&gt; thing.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I do not remember if a 79' has a boden tube (tube the guides the cable
&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; the clutch arm) or not. But you might want to check it to see if is at
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; proper angle and or not worn (coils in the tube might be stretched or
&gt; &gt; bent, when you have these problems.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have owned beetles for many years and have replaced
&gt; &gt; a number of boden tubes as a result of many types of clutch/shifting 
&gt; &gt; problems.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Let me know the result.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 	In my '79 Westphalia, I notice that on hot days (I swear this
&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't happen in cooler weather!) after driving and the engine
&gt; &gt; getting
&gt; &gt; &gt; hot, the clutch cable will grow too loose, making it grind when I
&gt; &gt; try to
&gt; &gt; &gt; go into reverse.  I'll crawl under and tighten it, everything seems
&gt; &gt; &gt; fine, and then a few days later the same thing will happen.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	The weird thing is this:  I've had the cable replaced recently,
&gt; &gt; &gt; same problem. AND, it can be really bad on a hot day, grinding when
&gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; try to get it into gear, but if I leave it be and drive it the next
&gt; &gt; day,
&gt; &gt; &gt; it's fine, not too loose at all.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	If it's just a stretching cable, why would it be out of
&gt; &gt; &gt; adjustment one day and then not the next?  And what the heck could
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; hot day have to do with it?
