for about $4 there is a fill-valve rebuild kit available that 
replaces the o-rings and gives a new supply of lubricant.  search the 
'95 archives under &quot;houg and propane and valve&quot;

consider too, that your tank may just be full.  maybe it only needed 
a little toping off and once the tank IS full, that button doesn't 
move.
