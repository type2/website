Subject: New VW truck sited in US


	For those of you that are on the lookout for new VW models in the US.  I
saw one this week, but not what you would expect.
	I was arriving at a customers shipping dept. this week to clear an error
code for them, and noticed the vehicle  that I had parked next to had lines
very similar to my '82 van.  I commented on this to the driver and he
laughed, then proceeded to show me the manufacturer ID plate.
	Guess what? The Kenworth 22-210 is a VW, it's made in Brazil.
	It's probably a bit bigger than most of you are looking for, it's a medium
class truck.  It falls into that area between BIG semi-truck and light truck
called a PUD (pickup and delivery) truck.
	Now, what I am wondering.  If they can import this thing (I would assume
free of the truck tax (otherwise they couldn't sell it on the truck market
due to price alone)), why can't the import other trucks, IE a commercial
van, a double cab, ect.?
