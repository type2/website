jackson.harvey_at_support_dot_com writes about having a Bentley manual with
mostly pictures and little verbiage.

At a swap meet last year I saw, but did not buy :(, a &quot;preliminary&quot;
Vanagon Service Manual by Bentley, which sounds like what you have -
lotsa pics and drawings, little text.  The first &quot;full&quot; Bentley I could
find covered the 80/81 models, and was about twice as thick as the
&quot;preliminary&quot; manual.  The &quot;preliminary&quot; manual might have had more
drawings regarding the body than what wound up in the regular version.

Over the years, the Bentley kept growing in size (and price!) to cover
the diesels and waterboxers (and maybe Syncros?).  I haven't seen the
final Vanagon Bentley, but from some of the postings, it sounds like it
might include VW's tech bulletins.  And I think it costs more than $100.
