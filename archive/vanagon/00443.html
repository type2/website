&gt; 
&gt; Now my Vanagon is running better I'm interested in making some other
&gt; improvements.  Unlike the other two I've owned, the '87 I have now came with
&gt; a pretty nice looking &quot;VW Design&quot; radio/tape player combination.  Is it any
&gt; good?  The stock speakers in Vanagons are so lousy it hard to tell !  I
&gt; don't like the front panel design with all the little buttons either,
&gt; cuz I can't see 'em conviently when driving (forget it at night, then it's 
&gt; completely touchy-feely &amp; as luck will have it).

I've got to where I can find the button I want by feel.  I have a Heidleberg
brand that came with the '91 Camper.  I don't have any problem with the sound
system.  What I am concered about is how warm/hot a cassette will get after
being played in it.  I'm also concerned with how to clean it.  The manual
just says to use a head cleaning cassette.  I'd rather do a manual clean but
It looks pretty tuff to get at the head.  Any suggestions?
