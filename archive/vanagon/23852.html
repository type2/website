Subject: Bus gas mileage (was: Vanagon motor swap???)



&gt;&gt;  -Steve Maher    smaher_at_gi_dot_com     '71 VW Transporter (13 MPG)
&gt;&gt;                                   '66 Mustang Coupevertible (18 MPG)
&gt;&gt;                                      go figure!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Steve, what are you haulin' in that bus?
&gt;
&gt;Haven't checked the bus mileage lately, but my '70 campmobile used to get
&gt;a whole lot more than 13...more like 17-23.


Not much-- that's the puzzle. Yeah, yeah, I know I'm overweight, but
not by THAT much...

I got this bus about 6 months ago. It's a '71 with a '70 single-port
engine in it. Passed smog test, has great power for a stock 1600. Has
always started beautifully when cold. When warm, you have to hold it
nearly floored (no pumping) and crank it for 5-10 sec before it starts.

Gets lousy gas mileage as you see, and tends to run hot. And recently,
it's been very unhappy-- a few times, after long freeway runs, when
slowing/speeding up, I'd get HUGE clouds of white (not gray or black)
smoke out the back end. A Jeep behind me yesterday swerved to miss the
cloud, and almost had a wreck. The rest of the time, it seems to run very
cleanly, and with excellent power. Yesterday after that long run,
it dieseled and ran on for several seconds after I shut it down in the
driveway-- first time I've EVER seen an air-cooled VW do that.

The problem has gotten me so worried, that my last 60-mile freeway run
was done with the engine hatch open for additional ventilaton. No help--
still smelled hot, and did its smoke-screen thing a few times, and the
dieseling at the end.

If it were valve seats or a burned valve, I'd expect smoke after every
long slowdown followed by a speedup. But usually I get no smoke, and
then every tenth time (maybe) a huge white burst.

Gen belt seems correctly tight-- 1/4 inch deflection when pressed, and
doesn't appear shiny.

For several months it had an idle-air adjustment problem, running real
rich I believe. Replaced the O-ring around the screw and readjusted.
Also adjusted valves-- they were pretty tight. Now set all to .006&quot;.

My possible guesses on what this thing is doing:

1.) A piece of cr*p in the cooling fan??? this could cause hot running,
which might lead to the rest.

2.) Here's a stretch: Maybe the power brake servo has a hole, and the
engine is drawing brake fluid all the way down that huge vacuum line
from the front of the bus to the intake manifold? And burning it
(occasionally) to form those huge white clouds?

3.) Badly worn valve seats, and I don't know what I'm talking about?

4.) Cracked or broken rings? (haven't heard any rattling or crunching).

5.) Badly worn or mis-seated rings?

6.) Vacuum leak somewhere (Tho idle is pretty smooth)? This could cause
overheating/messed up exhaust valves.

Well, I'm puzzled. Will begin to investigate these when I have time,
like next year or so :-/   If, that is, I don't just say the h*ll with
it, and throw in a dual-port engine with doghouse and alternator.
Financial problem there. Stay tuned.

Anyone like to hazard a guess as to what this engine is doing?
1600 SP, 30PICT-3, 009 (46 dwell, 8 BTDC), stock bus muffler and air
cleaner. Yes, I plugged the carb vacuum line.

Help, I've fallen and I can't fix my bus...
