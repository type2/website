Subject:      artwork needed

hi volks,

the tri-state transporters needs a logo!  we are a local chapter club for
both neato and limbo serving southwest ohio and surrounding areas, so i was
thinking of something that would represent all type 2's. any ideas? anyone
care to submit a design? due credit will be given!

thanks!
