Subject: Re: poptops

&gt;BTW, how long does it take to deploy (I love that choice of verbs) the
&gt;Westy pop-top?

Howdy!  I'm thinking of getting a Winnie conversion van, probably the '96
version.  I'm hoping that the '96 vans will have a 6-cylinder engine,
airbags, and ABS.

My question, however, is:  How the heck do you climb up into the bunk bed?
Do you step on the stove?  Sort of jump?  What?

Ron
