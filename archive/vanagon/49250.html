In a message dated 96-09-05 17:56:57 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; Is this trip correlated with the 2ft of snow in Montana?  
Yes, But Ive been there 5 times
If so, then the
 good traction is more likely due to all that weight. 
Not always this many people, or gear.
 
Of course, all snow is not equal.

That is true
 
 Two feet of fresh Montana snow (light and fluffy) is much
 different than frozen hard packed snow/ice which is around after the plows
 have been through. &gt;&gt;

I am a native New Englander(relocated West for 20 years) and can attest to
the quality of Crappy East Coast Snow(ice, slush, mush) not very dry or
fluffy, but I can also say, i think the wider tires would push through that
crap too.Obviously a skinny tire will reach the pavement quicker than a wide
foot....that is if you can reach the pavement.................
