Subject: Help: Oil Pressure Light ('89 Vangagon)

Hi,
The oil pressure light on my '89 Vanagon is worrying me a little.  After I
have been driving on the freeway ~65-70 mph for a few miles and then slow
down to an idle (~800 RPM) the oil pressure light comes on intermittently.
If I increase the RPMs to ~1,000 the light goes off.  I've checked the oil
...  What's the problem?

Thanks in Advance,
Bo Kersey
