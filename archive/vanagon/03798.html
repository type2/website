&gt; '84 vanagon camper, 103K miles, bought used in '87 at 33K miles.  The only
&gt; problem is head gasket leaks between cylinder sleeves and heads, happened
&gt; at approx 34K, 66K, 102K miles.  I have communicated with you earlier
&gt; about this.  Am probably going to get the rebuilt engine VW is offering
&gt; currently, use only VW coolant, and flush/replace coolant each year.  
&gt; 
&gt; I would love to receive the results of this survey.  My (non-authorized)
&gt; VW mechanic thinks *ALL* vanagons in these years have this problem.  I
&gt; would be very interested in knowing the statistics for this and other
&gt; problems.
&gt; 
&gt; Best wishes,  George
&gt; 
My question is: is it really only the '83 - '85 Vanagons that have this
problem? Or should those of us with later models pay attention to the
concept of flushing the coolant each year?
