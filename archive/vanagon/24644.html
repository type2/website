Subject: specs for Vanagon '86


Hi,
	I'm going nuts trying to do anything with my Westfalia
here in Switzerland. Back home (Canada), I could just say I had
a Vanagon '86 and everyone knew whether they had the right parts
for it. Here it seems there are so many types of VW busses that
they want all sorts of details I have no idea about. For example,
Vanagon doesn't even exist here, so I'm at a loss to give them 
a model name they might recognize. Then they want to know how
many cc the motor has.. ok, so I should know this.. but I don't.

	What I'm looking for now in a hurry is a starter as mine
seized on the *boat* trip over from Canada to Belgium (anybody 
care to try and explain why it would seize while it's not even
running??) I was hoping not to have to drive around to the sparse
scrapyards around, since you apparently can't cannibalize wrecks
yourself here but have to buy the parts at the counter. I was
hoping to let my fingers do the walking and the dialling and just
go to the place with the right part/price. Can someone advise me
as to what I need to ask for (i.e. what years/models will do)?


Thanks a bunch.
Please cc me directly as I have difficulty keeping up with the 
flow of mail from the list and store it in a file 'till I
find time.
