Subject:  speedometer progress

OK, I went to my '78 and pulled the speedo cable out of the back of the
wheel.  I took off the circlip that holds the cable end to the hub, expecting
the removal of the cable to also pull this thing out, but the part that goes
through the hub stayed in the hub.  I guess it was supposed to come out
and this makes the reason for the speedo not working quite obvious. 
The cable was no longer attached to the hub thing.  Anyway, I pulled out
that kick panel to get at the speedo cable and found out there are two
halves.  So I unscrewed the lower half from that box thing and took off
that pan under the front of the bus to work that cable out.  BTW, the
cable itself works, I turned it with pliers and the one going into the back
of the speedo turned.  It's just detached from that hub thing.  So I guess I
have to buy a new lower half.  

Right?

Sean
