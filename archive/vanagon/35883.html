hi gregg, 
	I have an '81 Westy, ie. air cooled, not much to bleed. It's funny 
the box my thermostat came in also told me to bleed my cooling system 
and fill the radiator with the engine running. These thermostat must 
be used on water cooled engines too. 
	Thanks for the information, I'll look at my Bentley.
