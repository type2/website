Interesting question but insufficient data. 
Who manufactured the replacement water pumps?
Who installed them?
What is the condition of the engine i.e. overheating?

&gt;Dear Experts:
&gt;
&gt;   I may be approaching the 3rd water pump changeout on my 84 
&gt;Vanagon..
&gt;   
&gt;   What gives?
&gt;   
&gt;   Why does my bus eat water pumps every 35k miles?
&gt;   
&gt;   Is there a heavy duty version available?
&gt;   
&gt;   Is this a do it yourself job?
