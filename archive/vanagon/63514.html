Subject: Re: A Stretching Clutch Cable?

I do not remember if a 79' has a boden tube (tube the guides the cable to
the clutch arm) or not. But you might want to check it to see if is at the
proper angle and or not worn (coils in the tube might be stretched or
bent, when you have these problems.

I have owned beetles for many years and have replaced
a number of boden tubes as a result of many types of clutch/shifting 
problems.

Let me know the result.

&gt; it's fine, not too loose at all.
&gt; 
&gt; 	If it's just a stretching cable, why would it be out of
&gt; adjustment one day and then not the next?  And what the heck could the
&gt; hot day have to do with it?
