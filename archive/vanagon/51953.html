Subject: SA's AUDI 5 Cyl. thoughts


Hello Listees,

According to another request about technical information to
Vanagon to AUDI 5 Cyl. engine conversions I received this
friendly answer from the VW South African people. Because
the different bellhousing is well known, I like to ask for
the engine support and give them some information about my
almost finished conversion.

&gt;Dear Helmut
&gt;
&gt;I have been in contact with our Service Technical Department
&gt;and they have returned the following results to me for your
&gt;attention:
&gt;
&gt;a)  You should be more specific in terms of the information
&gt;you require, as well as the route that you will follow to
&gt;effect the conversion.  The powertrain specifications that
&gt;detail all the changes are in fact tied in with the water
&gt;cooled chassis i.e. 2.1 bus with Digijet fuel injection.
&gt;
&gt;b)  Even though it is possible to do this conversion there
&gt;will be major structural changes to the body, we are not sure
&gt;of your local legislation is this respect.
&gt;
&gt;c)  The engine bay floor needs to be raised 100 mm and the
&gt;length of the bay increased to accommodate the longer 5
&gt;cylinder engine, also the transmission must be moved forwards.
&gt;
&gt;d)  Perhaps you should obtain our engine and transmission
&gt;combination, and then mock up the vehicle around this.
&gt;This is the simplest route to follow.
&gt;
&gt;Kind Regards

Some comments to c)

In my conversion the engine and transmission support are
lowered by 30 mm and I figured out, that the engine deck lid
needs to be raised by 40 mm. The AUDI 5 Cyl. engine comes
with two block length, 541 mm and 583 mm (This is from my mind).
I got the shorter one and I had to cut the front end of the
hole for the lid to get some space for the ignition distributor.
This was a 10 mm forward cut on the length of 100 mm.
The aircooled tranny don't need to be moved forwards. This
is different to the Diesel boxes.


Stay tuned for further information,

Helmut
