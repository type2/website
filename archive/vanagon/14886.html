&gt; Richard,
&gt; 
&gt; We showed up Sunday at about 2pm to see if anyone was still at
&gt; Umstead and to do a little hiking. Sorry we missed the rest of you.
&gt; I think the '76 that Janet and Dave were driving is the one I sold
&gt; them back in December. Glad to hear it's looking good!
Man, it is great! got any more? :)
&gt; 
&gt; Originally we were headed to New Bern to camp this weekend but
&gt; plans have changed and I might go to Farmington for the day. Do you
&gt; have the details available: location, time, etc?
&gt; 
Farmington is past Winston-Salem, on west I-40. it is about 15 miles or
so past. just get off on the exit for highway 801 (I'm not sure what
exit # it is) and turn right off the highway. Drive for a few miles, and
you will see the Farmington Dragway on your right. It costs $12 per
person, and things start early, except for the drag racing, which starts
around lunch. Hope to see you there.
Richard
