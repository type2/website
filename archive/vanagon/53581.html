Subject: 97 EV/Winnie Sightings

Just stopped by Royal (was Gateley) VW in Orlando. They have two 97 
Winnebago's in stock. List price? $38,500 Broken down, it's 24K for the EV, 
10K for the conversion, 500 for a middle seat, 3K for Market Value???,  plus 
1k in dealer prep (Paintguard, scotchguard ie...). Only one cupholder inside 
(right rear back seat), and when you put the second seat in, you can't get 
into the fridge. No glovebox (airbag), but deep pockets in both doors. Has 
some type DC/AC inverter onboard but was unable to determine wattage.  Didn't 
take a test drive (had the baby and didn't want to swap out car seats) but 
with the VR6 it should be a respectable performer. Drove a Passat wagon with 
the VR6 last month and was very impressed. Maybe I can finally get the wife to 
trade the Previa.

Happy New Year to all!
