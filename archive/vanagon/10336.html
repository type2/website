&gt; Now, about this Ferrari-esque horse on the Westfalias &quot;everyone&quot; was 
&gt; talking
&gt; about a few weeks ago (I know, I'm a little behind the times!), while
&gt;  labeling
&gt; a box of new books/tapes for the Department the other day, I saw a pa
&gt; ge in a
&gt; book that had the &quot;coat-of-arms&quot; for all the German &quot;states&quot;.  Westfa
&gt; liawerke
&gt; is in Nordrhein-Westfalen, I beleive, (either that in Niedersachsen--
&gt; either way
&gt; my theory works...) and the &quot;coat-of-arms&quot; for that state has the Fer
&gt; rari-esque
&gt; horse in it.  Hope this clears up the mystery.  (the coat-of-arms for
&gt;  Nieder-
&gt; sachsen also has a Ferrari-esque horse).  I'd certainly be curious to
&gt;  find out
&gt; if this is indeed how the horse got there!

Permit an amateur herald to respond: the arms of the German
State of Westphalia are :
 
WESTPHALIA.  Gules, a horse courant argent.

That is, On a red background, a white horse on its hind legs.

The Ferrari horse is black, as I remember.  It may or may not
be the same as the arms of Stuttgart -- I don't have a German
Armorial with me.

Thanks for the help with the curtain tabby things, by the way.
