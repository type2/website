&gt; Ok i got my '73 bus up and running yesterday.  It had been sitting for
&gt; quite some time - like a coupla years.  Occassionally i would start it up
&gt; and tool down the drive.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ater hitting the road for about 15-20mins yesterday, i smelled burning
&gt; brakes.  Sure enough the front pads were firmly against the disc. 
&gt; Hammering against them would loosen them, but once i pushed on the brake
&gt; they would lock up again.  
&gt; 
&gt; Is this problem fixable?  Has anyone else ever had this type of thing
&gt; happen?  
&gt; 
Yes, calipers do that, especially rebuilt Mercedes calipers. If you have
the time, rebuild them.
