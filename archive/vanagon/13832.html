Subject: alcohol burner question

Does anyone know much about alcohol burners?  Do they
produce as much condensation/moisture as propane?  What
about their consumption of oxygen?  Do they produce
as a byproduct of their combustion CO, the way that propane
does?  Therefore recommended to be ducted/vented?  Pros?  Cons?  

thanks....
