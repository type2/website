Subject: More Wannabus turns Gottabus

Add my name to the ranks of new/used owners

over the weekend I scored a 1984 Vanagon GL for $1,600. I thought it was
kind of on the cheap side, when I did the checks everything was ok. After the
test drive coolant was leaking from both sides of the engine (looking from
the rear
bumper front under the bus. I can only imagine that this means Head gasket
failure
and is going to cost me up the whazoo. Also the water warning light was
acting weird 
as well (see earlier post: Wacky Warning Light).

The owner wanted 2,800 for it and I said this is was I was going to pay him.
To be honest, I am good with small engine repairs (I had a Rabbit GTI and
worked on it) This is way-way outta my league. Can anyone give me a ballpark
(can we say that since they're on strike?) figure on the repairs? Just so I have
an idea of the shock to expect. Any local quotes (Chicago area) are cool to. 

Thanks in advance (Since I'm sure I'll be here alot!)
