&gt;It varies from state to state.  However, the general rule seems to be
&gt;that when a vehicle becomes twenty-five years old, it can be
&gt;registered as `classic', `vintage', or `collector'.  The common
&gt;significance of this is that you get a different style of license
&gt;plate.
In WA state if you have a TAG from the year of the car with the year of make
sticker (TAB) you can register it for like $30 and then have to pay no
yearly taxes.  The car must be 30+ years old.  At the VW shows there is a
dealer who sales early tags. A '64 in rough shape is running like $60.  I
think there are limitations on the type of driving you can do but I am
un-sure on this.

Pre '67 cars in WA don't require emmisions checking. My '68 bug is about to
get a new engine for a day so it will pass, and then back goes in the old
one...yeah yeah so it's not to nice but it's the same eninge as our '66
kombi, the law sucks!

&gt;The varying qualities of such a designation may include lowered (or
&gt;no) emissions standards, different registration fees (may be higher or
&gt;lower), changed insurance rates, etc.
