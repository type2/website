I second the motion, Dyer. Excellent reading, lots of great B&amp;W pics.,
intersting history.  Wait 'till I tell my wife you got it for $1... she paid ten
(4th printing, but excellent condition with dust cover).
The book, Small Wonder, The Amazing Story of the Volkswagen, is by Walter Henry
Nelson. There is no ISBN #, it was first printed in 1965. Library of Congres
card # is 65-10899.

Highly Recommended to All!

&gt;I'm reading the book &quot;Small Wonder&quot;, a history of the Volkswagen written
&gt;in the '60s.  I found it interesting that when Adolf Hitler layed the
&gt;cornerstone of the factory at (what would later be called) Wolfsberg
&gt;in ~1938, he pronounced that the new volksauto that had been designed
&gt;by Porsche would be called the KdF-wagen.  KdF is an acronym for a
&gt;german group at the time whose name translated as &quot;strength-through-joy&quot;.
