Well, I've looked at most of my tech references.  What are the
Tri-Electrode Plugs gapped at?

Thanks

&gt;&gt;what's used in the Mazda RX7's.  Upon inspecting them, it appears 
&gt;that

&gt;
&gt;yeah, but don't NEVER trust that factory gap. if Bozo and Bubba 
&gt;dropped the
&gt;case of plugs when they put it on the shelf at the FLAPS, one or more 
&gt;of the
&gt;plugs can be squished. always check the gap on any plugs you're 
&gt;putting in
&gt;your bus. &lt;the Voice of Painful Experience and Lost Trust!!&gt;    :)
