Subject: Re: crank bearing removal

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I need to remove the #3 main bearing from the Bus crankshaft.  However,
&gt;&gt;I am without a press of any sort.  Anybody know a trick, using common
&gt;&gt;household appliances or rocks, on how to remove this bearing?

Is this #3 main bearing special that it takes a press to remove? When I worked
on bug and BMW engines all main bearing halves can be removed by a light tap
by a piece of wood block. Of course you could use a sledge hammer to do it (
just kidding). Maybe I am wrong, I don't see what the difficulty is.
