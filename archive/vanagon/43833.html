Subject: 1938 VolkswagenWerk Groundbreaking Pins

Hi all:

Picked up a couple of these over the past month and am wondering how 
to tell the repros from the originals.  I suspect I paid a bit much 
but then my brain shut down when I ran across them.

These are the pins with the Beetle silhouette (3/4 view) with 
swastika-in-cogwheel (labor front logo) rising like a sun behind it.  
Lettering is incised in base and filled with red paint; the rest of 
the pin/badge is unpainted metal - pewter looking.

Most excellent items; never seen one in person.  Odd that I found two 
within two weeks of each other, one in the nazi/wwII junk section in 
an antique store in Fernandina Beach, FL; the other at the good old 
Tallahassee Flea Market.

If they're real, I got 'em for a song; if not, boy did they see me 
coming....:^)
