&gt; So martha rubin says:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; On the next trip, I'm going to enlist the help of the other females
&gt; &gt; to do a beer frisk - GAWD, you guys had SO MANY bottles.  How can you
&gt; &gt; drink that stuff in the cold?  I mean, there was glass and caps 
&gt; &gt; EVERYWHERE - that alley between our vans looked worse than skid row.
&gt; &gt; Disgusting!  ;)

Since when is policing the area women's work? And since when
do men drink all the beer?  Oops, I forgot. NoCal is cheap
white wine country! ;-&gt;

BTW -- is anyone in SoCal familiar with the Twentynine Palms
area?  I haven't been there in years, but it sounds like a 
desert area which would be moderatly close to both the NoCal
and SoCal people, which the four of us in Zonie-Land could 
make as well!
