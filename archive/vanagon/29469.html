                    Doing It to Grendel


Sunday, 19 November 1995


It has been about a month since Grendel brought me home.  The
six-week duration of what was meant to be a quick trip created a
host of problems for me at home.  But problems are patient
things.  They were waiting for me when I returned.  I used
Grendel for a few short trips as I tackled the mountain of
chores.  

Grendel said she would get me home and she did but once home she
let me know that using her for a daily driver was pushing my
luck, so I parked her and have only now found time to start
fulfilling my side of the bargain, which was to return her to
something resembling good condtion.

Whenever I had a few minutes I worked at stripping her interior,
learned more of her checkered past with each panel I removed. 
One reason for her heavily rusted sills was the layers of plywood
and carpet on the floor of the cargo bay.  Portions of the multi-
layered mess were still damp despite being parked for a month in
the California sun.  

Behind the interior panels, the stock styrofoam insulation had
come adrift in every case.  It provided no insulation since it
was no longer glued to the body.  Judging from the shape of the
hardened adhesive, some of the panels came loose within minutes
of being installed.

When time permitted, I cleared a place to work where Grendel will
rest on jack-stands for the next five or six months.  Friday, I
maneuvered her into the space, the last time she will run under
her own power until her overhaul is done.  The space is behind
the shop on a rough concrete pad laid down to reduce run-off from
our unpaved back driveway.  I spent considerable time getting
Grendel's feet in the air on an even keel, with jack-stands under
the front and rear torsion tubes.  I removed her wheels and
stored them under her belly.  The tires must be dismounted and
the rims sandblasted &amp; painted.  If the budget allows, I'll buy
her a new set of skins and keep the pair of Michelins as spares;
you really need two spares if you plan to spend much time off-
pavement.

Today I began Doing It, stripping Grendel down.  Since her engine
hatch has no hinges removing it was a snap -- just untwist the
bailing wire.  Ditto for the rear sheet metal.  One of her many
collisions had been bad enough to tear out the nuts welded to the
chassis.  Cut the bailing wire and let the thing fall off.  It is
so rusty and battered and chopped up -- modified to allow use of
a sedan muffler -- that it's not a good candidate for repair. 
Into the junk pile, along with the engine hatch, which has
extensive internal rust.

I removed the boat-trailer light fixtures I'd installed to get us
home, along with the garden tractor headlight I'd mounted as a
back-up light.  The Boom Tube muffler came away next, its
underside coated with a layer of fried tranny lube.  Disconnected
the battery, carried it into the shop.  Disconnected the engine,
removed it, put it on a scooter and wrapped it in several layers
of plastic.  I'll remove the tin-ware, clean it up, keep it
around the shop as a utility engine.

The sky was cloudless and there was no wind at all.  The
temperature hovered near eighty.  Out over the ocean a heavy bank
of fog hid Catalina from view.  Although it's more than fifty
miles away, on really nice days Catalina stretches out on the
horizon like a lazy dragon in the sea.

Evening fell swiftly as I was hunkered in Grendel's engine
compartment draining gasoline into a jerry can.  I've pulled the
bleeders and brake fluid is draining quietly into a couple of
cans.  Ditto for the gear boxes and tranny.  All must be removed
and it's best to drain them first.  Time is on my side.  I'll
leave them to drip for a couple of days.

Grendel's brake drums are off.  Only one is reusable, the others
out of spec for turning.  The front bumper doesn't want to come
off.  I'm coaxing it in that direction.  The lower front body
panel is eaten up with rust and will have to be replaced. 
Grendel's nose has suffered at least two collisions and I'm not
sure if repairing it is worth the trouble, I've a good nose clip
in case I get lazy and decided to replace the whole thing.

In order to know what repairs are needed I must first scrub away
the layers of dirt and grease that have accumulated over the
years.  Both of the sills and much of the cargo bay floor will
have to be replaced but that's fairly straight forward, cut out
the cancer and weld in new metal.  Fortunately, all of the panels
I'll need are available either from J. C. Whitney or one of the
other after-market suppliers.  The driver's side sill repair will
be rather tricky since the entire length of the sill, both inner
and outer, are rotted away.  The only difficult point about
repairs to the floor stem from the fact the lower portion of the
door posts and internal side-frame members are also destroyed. 
I'll have to fabricate patches for those sections before I can
tackle the floor since cutting away the rotted portions of the
floor would leave the posts &amp; side-frame members without any
support.

Back aft, Grendel has layers of bondo up to an inch thick. 
Instead of repairing her damaged sheet metal, someone merely
filled in the dents with bondo.  Unfortuantely, she had other
accidents that did additional sheet metal damage but even worse,
caused the slabs of bondo to crack, allowing the metal beneath to
rust.  

Finally, there is the structural damage to the rear frame member
on the driver's side.  One of Grendel's accidents was so powerful
it buckled the frame member with enough force to fracture the
metal.  This will have to be cut away, straightened and welded
back into place.  But first, I'll have to deal with the slabs of
bondo.  Then I must dismantle the crumbled sheet metal under the
bondo in order to cut away the damaged frame member.

Up front, the repairs are relatively straight-forward.  The
cockpit floor must be replaced along with the rear of the front
wheel wells and the base of the front door pillars.  The only
difficulty here is removal of the clutch and brake pedals, master
cylinder, gear shift lever and emergency brake.  I think I can
work around the steering gear.  Part of the up-front work will
bee to fabricate a skid plate in anticipation of Canada's unpaved
roads.

All of these tasks call for a fairly low level of body-working
skills which is fortunate because I'm not much of a body &amp; fender
man.  But the cargo bay doors are rusted out along their lower
edges.  Repairing them is going to be a challenge since I'll have
to fabricate the door's inner-lower sheet metal, a rather tricky
shape having several compound curves.

I'll tackle the body work a bit at a time, I'm really more
concerned with the tranny and running gear.  Yet the mechanical
repairs will take only a matter of days whereas the body work is
going to take several months.  Part of the task will be to design
and build a one-man camper interior suitable for the Inuvik trip,
taking into account the short-wave radio, computer, printer,
Terminal Node Controller, antenna tuner and so forth that I'll
need to keep in touch with the list from downtown Moose Knee,
Manitoba, or wherever Tobin leads us on his merry chase to find
the world's thirstiest mosquitos.
