Subject: '56 kombi - moaning wheel

Ok,

	Its time to revisit the moaning wheel:

	My front right wheel makes this moaning, groaning kinda noise.  I just
put new wheen bearings in last December.  I fixed a master cylinder problem
last week, but it still sounds like its rubbing or something.  The noise
is consistent with speed.  I've re-greased the wheel bearings a couple of
times.  It will make the noise even if I just put the drum on the spindle
with my hands, and wiggle it back and forth, without the nuts.

	Any new gueses?  This is the _only_ mechanical niggly I have right
now!

Thom
