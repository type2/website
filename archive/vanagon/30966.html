Subject: Re: *Women don't understand (was SO convincing)

Rusty comes to the defense of the Ladies!
Bob threw out some obvious flame bait and said &quot;Many women will not
understand this.&quot; Some do. Bob didnt say no women would understand. So dont
jump on the Hoov or I. I know several fe-persons who are or were into VWs
and their husbands, SO's, or SOB's have no interest. Linda B. on the
Vintagvw list is in this category. For the record, her husband is a nice guy
and lets her do her thing. He's bigger than me also! ;) 'Sup ladies, what
cha think?
I recognize a potential thread change when I see one. Also it depends on the
&quot;waif&quot; and the &quot;wife.&quot; Sorry in advance Gerry 8I

&gt;Of course, no two Volkswagens are even in exactly the same state of repair.
&gt; That's where we come in.  If we have part of a set of Volkswagens, we have a
&gt;moral obligation to round out the pair.  And if the only way we can do so is
&gt;to bring home some waif and restore it, then that is right and proper.  After
&gt;all, there are some things a guy just has to do.
&gt;
&gt;Many women will not understand this.  Perhaps it's a guy-thing.
