Subject:       Re: Chemical hand warmers

Bill relates:
&gt; 	I've got one of those super saturated sodium acetate hand warmers
&gt; - the kind with a clear gel in a plastic bag, and a clicker, and you
&gt; snap the clicker and the gel crystalizes and you get the heat of
&gt; fusion. You can recharge it by dropping it in boiling water for about
&gt; 10 minutes, to redesolve the salt. Its cool to watch the crystalization
&gt; proceded too!

Actually, those sodium acetate warmers are  my favorite for 'around 
the house'  and yes, the crystalization is neat!  Does anyone know 
where to get (cheaply) food-grade sodium acetate?  It seems they'd be 
easy to make.
