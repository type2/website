So Larry R. MacPhee says:
&gt; busted.  I wrote to &quot;Delta Six Industries&quot; which makes replacement camper
&gt; parts but have gotten no reply so far.  

I recieved a pamplet from them after I called.  How long have you been
waiting?  

&gt; 5) Hot laser to zap cars that pass me even when I'm keeping up with traffic.

Man, this one really ticks me off.  I'll be passing someone going a few MPH
less than me and all-of-a-sudden, they can't stand the thought of a VW
Camper passing them and so they speed up.  What's with these people?  
Then there are those that cut you off all of the time as if your not
even there.  I like to give those people my brites.  Then they wonder
what they did.  Totally clueless.  

Same thing for those people that pull out from a side street right
in front cause they think you're going to be too slow.  Ugh!!
