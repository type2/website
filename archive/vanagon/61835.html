Ed, Your story reminds me of when I sold cars New Orleans in '75. I
brought some friends in to buy a used car. I told the sales manager I
wanted to give them a &quot;good deal&quot; and without batting an eye he told me
&quot;If you can't make money off your friends, who CAN you make it from?&quot;
It's hard to say from what you have described if you got a bad deal. An
'85 camper with only 113,5K probably sat for long periods. You have to
expect soft parts like hoses, canvas, moulding, etc. to deteriorate if
not cared for. These would be normal maintenance items for a 12 year old
vehicle. As for the exhaust system if you go by the VW price list it can
be very scary, however these parts can be purchased  very reasonably at
foreign parts stores and installed by you.  On the other hand, if you are
not inclined to do your own work, you can expect to PAY for someone else
to do it. Or you should buy a newer vehicle that doesn't require so much
maintenance. I know the &quot;pocket book&quot; rules, especially if you have had
some large medical bills.
As for the front windshield washer unit, I thought mine was cracked, so I
removed it yesterday and found out that it is a two part thingy, with the
neck form the floor going into the tank, it didn't seal properly so it
appeared to leak, actually the tank was fine.
  
I know this is still a tuff decision, so weigh all the info you get from
this wonderful list and go from there.

Don't forget junk yards!!
