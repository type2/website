Subject: 1972 bubble-bus


I know a fellow who is seeking to sell his 1972 bus.  It has a 
&quot;Vantastic&quot; conversion (bubble-top).  It has a solar-powered fridge and 
stereo (hooked in-circuit with a deep-cycle batt.), stove (Coleman), 
sink, and westy-bed.  The body is in good shape, paint too.  The front 
end is in good shape.  The transmission is in good shape.  

The problem?  Siezed motor--the oil pump failed _at_65mph.  

At any rate, the guy is looking to sell, and fast.  The PPO was quite a 
mechanic (I mean that in a good context), but the current owner is not, 
and is thus tired of paying a professional mechanic to fix it.  Myself, I 
would buy it, but my '70 Kombi project keeps me too busy (&amp; poor!).  

The bus is in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Please e-mail me direct 
(jhopp_at_mail.unm_dot_edu) for more info.
