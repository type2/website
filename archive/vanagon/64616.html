Jesse,

On my 86 water-cooled I was having very similar problems, the o2 sensor was
the culprit, your symptoms would show up in the winter and when ever the
van was driven in the rain, I finally got out the squirt bottle after
various suggestions from fellow list members and doused all the wiring
hoping to see the light show. It was relayed to me that if any ignition
wires were bad then they would short to ground when wet, no luck on the
simulation. Until I sprayed the top of my o2 sensor, then the van idled
lousy, but upon start up would be semi normal until the o2 sensor dried
out,  then normal. the sensor is an after market one that was recommended
to me, doesn't have the heater wires, yours may be a single wire design
compared to a three wire design. To check the effect of the o2 sensor, I
connected my + lead on the volt meter to the sensor connection (when the
van is turned off) still connected, the neg. lead goes to  a grounded spot
anywhere. the results are:
van running at idle approx. 5.5 volts dc(varying up and down a bit, less
than 1 volt), spray the top of the o2 sensor and got water inside, =drop to
less than one volt, van running rough. I found that if the voltage was
below 4.2 vdc then the van would idle really rough, as the water dried the
voltage would rise, letting me know that it responded to temperature and
water.

I cannot vouch for the correct voltage measurement, cause I don't have that
factory $265.00(can) o2 sensor.

this all might not be your problem, but my eyes were opened to the need for
a working o2 sensor.

just my o2cents worth

&gt;&gt; Cold starts are fine
&gt; idles erratically if left idling for a few minutes, eventually stalls
&gt; drives fine at highway speeds
&gt; stalls when slowing down to a stop
&gt; won't start right away after stall
&gt; will start when left to sit a few minutes
