&gt; I have never heard anyone use the term &quot;bus plus&quot;. Most of the list
&gt;  refers to it as the &quot;weekender&quot; package. Actually, I like the term bus
&gt;  plus better, but I usually call mine a Westy because it has the pop-top
&gt;  (with Westfalia on the front and back). 

Speaking of 86 Vanagon model names:
VW's name for this model was the &quot;Vanagon Camper&quot;.  The Westys with the full
compliment of camping stuff were called the &quot;Vanagon Camper GL&quot;.  
The term &quot;Weekender&quot;, while reasonably descriptive, is confusing because VW
never used this name to describe any Vanagon with a pop-top and they did use
this name to describe the fold-down rear seat &amp; cushion option on the
non-camper models.

While I like the term &quot;Weekender&quot;, don't be suprised if someone else has a
different interpretation of what it means.
