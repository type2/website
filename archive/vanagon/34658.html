Okay everybody in the Southeast:

I know it was 4 degrees yesterday morning, but it's supposed to
be in the 60's this weekend, so....

This weekend is the campout sponsored by Peach State Transporters.
Campout will be held at Cloudland Canyon State Park in Northwest
Georgia.  A caravan will be leaving from Southern Tech in Marietta,
GA at 10:00am, don't be late!  Hope to arrive at the campsite
between 12-1pm if anyone wants to meet us there.

We will be camping Saturday night and probably will caravan to
Little River Canyon near Fort Payne, AL on the way back on
Sunday.

Cloudland Canyon info:

75 tent &amp; trailer sites
16 rental cottages

Open 7am-10pm year round (office 8am-5pm)
