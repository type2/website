&gt;Hello, my wife was parking the Vanagon by the braille method and
&gt;banged up the rear bumper pretty bad. Luckily there is no body damage.
&gt;We priced a new bumper from the VW dealer and the price was over
&gt;$400.00. That seems like a lot of money for the thin piece of chromed
&gt;metal that makes a bumper.
&gt;
&gt;Is there any chance of finding a good bumper in a junk yard? Or is
&gt;there a better source of new bumpers?

Wives.... he he :)

The Bumper Mart in Dallas, TX (214 or 972(not sure)263-3676)will straighten and
re-chrome your bumper for about $150. plus shipping. They did ft and rr of mine
- my wife had nothing to do with it :( - and they look better than the factory
finish .
