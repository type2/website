Subject: Don't laugh (GNATT)

OK folks.  Thanks to Gerry's gentle prodding, I'll be joining the western
leg of GNATT at Washington, Iowa, probably driving good old Frau Blucher.
Note, however, that you all must solemnly affirm that you will not laugh at
the Frau--she's sensitive about her &quot;liver spots&quot;.  Meanwhile, I've
unsubscribed since I'm going to Calif. for a conference, followed hot on the
heels by finals week here at the college.  (By way of interesting
coincidence, we'll be staying with a fellow Vanagoneer whose SO was my best
friend in high school... indeed a small world...)

Back on the list soon.  See y'all in May!
