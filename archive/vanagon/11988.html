Subject: Ooooooh, that wascally pilot bearing!

After endless hours of cleaning, the engine is finally going back together.
Tuesday  night the case went back together withou t a hitch, although it
took a few tries to get the crank bearings lined up properly.  Last night I
set up a makeshift doohickey to measure the crankshaft axial play, and
wonder of wonders, it went smoothly also.  Not only that, but with the
original shims, the end play was exactly .004&quot;, just like it's supposed to
be.


But then....

I decided, &quot;Oh, I better pop out the pilot bearing (in the end of the
crank) while I'm thinking about it.&quot;  Well  the damn thing wouldn't budge.I
finally managed to destroy the bearing by yanking on it with various NDFTST
implements (not designed for that specific task).  However, the bearing
shell remains in the crank.  My not so cunning plan is to buy a ASD drill
bit (appropriate sized diameter) - 20 mm at lunch, and drill the damn thing
out.  Anyone got a better idea?
