Sure, you have that done.  When I had to replace the handle on my bus, I 
pulled one off of a bus in a junk yard.  Obviously my key didn't work in 
it.  So I opened it up and rekeyed it myself.  It's almost easy if you 
understand how a lock works.  I think the locksmith would charge about 
$15-20 for the job... the VW locks are pretty easy.
