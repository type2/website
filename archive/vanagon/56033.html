Dave, the interior layout of your 7 passenger van is called the &quot;wolfsburg
seating&quot; layout, or the &quot;Carat&quot; seating layout.(two removeable rear facing
jumpseats) both Wolfsburg 7 pass, and Carat 7 pass. are basically the same
thing. And, yes, for some reason the '87-up Wolfsburg/Carats said
&quot;Westfalia-Werke&quot; under the back seat. I think it was because Westfalia made
the left side panel that has the fold out table in it.  That does not mean
it's a Westfalia, though.....
