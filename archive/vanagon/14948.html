No.

&gt;&gt;OK. Here is my $0.02.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;..their rubber floor mats! These cost only about $30 plus shipping; they
&gt;&gt;are made for Vanagon.
&gt;
&gt;Derek, do these cover the whole floor, over the hump/shift lever base and up 
&gt;the front wall? If not, do they sell a full size one, like my panel has in 
&gt;it? I hate carpet!!! tim s.
