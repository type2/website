So is being a wise cracker a part of owning EVs?  At least three of us
have this trait...

&gt;The mounting replaced various amazingly heavy metal bits which I think 
&gt;used to hold the rear bumper on.  No muss, no fuss.

Nothing except bolts that were too short replaced when I added my hitch 
(yeah did it myself) as it bolted onto the sides of the frame.  Had to 
bend one heat shield out of the way and then bend it back.

&gt;In seeming contrast to the soft paint on the EVs, the Golf has not shown any 
&gt;signs of peeling, fading, or cracking.

Diverging to the paint - is the golf paint different because it is from 
Mexico instead of Germany pehaps?

Oh and a local dealer has a Vanagon painted up like the Harlequin Golfs 
that they seem to use to shuttle customers and such.  Guess it makes it easy 
to spot in the Metro (subway) parking lots which is where I usually see it.

&gt;Also,  can someone give me directions to the bug out?  I would be coming from
&gt;DC on Rt 66.

Least turns is go until you get to Rte 234 Manassas than go South.  Stop 
when you get there.  Alternatively you can go South on 95 and turn North 
when you get to rte 234 Dumfries/Manassas.  This is show is just a few 
minutes from my current house soif you want &quot;shorter&quot; but with more turns 
send me private email...
