Subject: Re: Fridge temps

Hi all!

Have been away from the list for awhile. Caught the Indians Fever here
in Cleveland, and was rendered temporarily insane. 

About fridge temps - I haven't put a thermometer in my fridge, but
here is my experience. Pre chill your food before it goes in the VW
fridge. Put it in the house fridge at least 24 hours ahead of time.
Also, plug in you van to shore power, and turn on the fridge a day
ahead of time. Or fire up the propane power. If you do this, your
food will stay cold. In fact I still haven't used it long enough to
figure out what the right setting is. So far I have only used it
on maximum cold, and that was cold enough to freeze soda cans on the
top shelf. So it was in fact colder than 40F up at the top. I
intend to put in a fridge fan next summer. It will be my winter
project to see if I can rig one up. I can't see paying $25 for one
at the RV store when it's made up of about $2 worth of parts.
