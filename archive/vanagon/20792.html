Subject: another update on my dead '73 bus

Okay, so this weekend I will take out my engine to see if it really needs
heads.  Oh, by the way, how can I tell if it is the heads?  What will I see? 
I'm hoping this will be fun since I never did this on a VW (I exchanged a
Mustang engine once, though).  Should I take the engine and tranny (auto) out
together?  Which book(s) should I follow most?  I have Bentley and Muir (oh
yeah, and a worthless chilton's).

If it is the heads it seems that everyone thinks that I should replace both at
the same time.  Where should I get them from?  Is GEX my best bet?  Should I
order it direct from GEX (i.e. is it cheaper?) or should I order them through
The Bus Stop (RMM)?  Could I just rebuild my own?  I'm just a poor grad student
so I want to go cheap, but not sacrifice quality (yeah, who doesn't).

Off the topic but does anyone know where I can get a muffler for a Type III? 
My Squareback is great fun to drive but it's just a bit noisy and I feel bad
for the neighborhood.

Thanks all,
-Erik
