Kevin, 

When my EV Contis gave up the ghost, I replaced them with Michelin MXL
205/65 R 15s Reinforced tires. The unfortunate thing about EV tires is the 
reinforced sidewall requirement.

I got my tires mail order thru either Tire Rack or Tire America, both of 
which advertise in Road and Track. I believe I paid under $90 for each.

No matter what you are going to do for tires, don't scrimp...make sure you 
get the reinforced sidewall!!!!

Ric
