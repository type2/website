Thanks for the warning, I've always wondered about that!  Nothing bad
has ever happened to me with that, but I always freak a little bit when
driving in those garages and seeing the ceiling so close to the top--it
provokes my natural protect-the-bus instinct!

&gt; 
&gt; Last weekend I attended a conference in the D.C. area where I stayed
&gt; at a hotel with a basement parking garage. Since this was the only
&gt; parking the hotel offered free, I very slowly and carefully pulled the
&gt; van ('87 Westy) up to the overhead yellow barrier indicating the
&gt; amount of clearance required to park in the garage. I jumped out and
&gt; inspected the situation and ascertained that I had about 4 inches to
&gt; spare to get under the bar.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, call me naive, but I said &quot;OK - go for it&quot;. I rolled under the
&gt; barrier AOK, then proceeded (very slowly) down the entrance ramp and
&gt; made a right-hand turn into the garage proper. As I was approaching
&gt; the ticket-dispensing machine it happened - scraping sounds from the
&gt; roof area!
&gt; 
&gt; Oh dear. I immediately stopped and inspected the situation; the garage
&gt; ceiling was smooth so the distance btw. the ceiling and floor was
&gt; obviously narrowing. Well I wasn't wedged in (if I had been it would
&gt; have been let-some-air-out-of-the-tires-time), so I began the process
&gt; of reversing out of the garage. And that was a very tedious,
&gt; nerve-racking experience which wasn't helped much by the fact that
&gt; there were 2 cars behind me that had to reverse out as well!
&gt; 
&gt; No real damage was done to the van, so there's a happy ending to this
&gt; tale.
&gt; 
&gt; Moral of the story? Don't blindly trust those height barriers at
&gt; parking garages!
