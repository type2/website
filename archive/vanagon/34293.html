Bradley makes a a very good point here:

&gt; This kinda makes me wonder what the real amount of regular readers
&gt; we have. I know there are at least a few people that read it on the web
&gt; site also.

Besides the unknown sniveling lurkers that subscribe, there is an
entire other group of people not subscribing who read the list off
the Web. If Joel wants to have a more complete statistical picture
of the influence of Gerry's creation, he ought to periodically 
post a request to Web readers to send him a reply,if nothing else
so he could count'em every so often.

You were getting bored, weren't you, Joel. ;-).
