&gt; Hi again.  I'm still trying to put my '81 into factory condition.  I have
&gt; some stuff coming from the Parts Place.  Are they usually reliable?

	I have never been happy with those guys. Twice I tried to order from
them and the price quoted was at least double their catalog price. A
mainshaft bearing was quoted over three times higher than their newest
catalog. They even had the nerve to say the price in the catalog was
three years old. Well then change it, don't keep me on the phone for 20
min to try to scam more money. I don't even consider doing business with
them anymore.
