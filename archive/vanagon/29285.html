&gt;I recently got my hands on a 1989 Westfalia Camper here in the US, and would 
&gt;like to possibly purchase some unique European parts for my Vanagon while 
&gt;I'm over in Denmark, (maybe Germany) over the Christmas holidays.  Any 
&gt;ideas?

Thanks,
Peter

Wow,
someone from the list is coming to Denmark! 
I don't know much about '89 westfalias or unique European parts, but give me
a call and I'll treat you to a cold beer and show you my 1961 221, and try to
put you on track to local suppiers.
