&gt; 
&gt; Hey volksfolks,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm in search of a 93 Eurovan Westfalia Weekender to replace the one I
&gt; rolled a few weeks ago.  The weekender (without the stove, etc.) is VERY
&gt; hard to find, as they were only imported in 1993.
&gt; 
&gt; Please email kndgrn_at_manoman_dot_com if you know of one available for sale.  Or
&gt; call 415-626-6626.  I am in northern california, but will extend my search
&gt; to the lower 48.  I really like these vans.
&gt; 
&gt; Ever evolving and ever hopeful,
&gt; 
&gt; Carter
&gt; 
&gt; .
&gt;From the Seattle Times Classified Ads website this weekend:

'93 Eurovan MV - Westfalia Wkender, Wht, AT, A/C, poptop, slps 4, new tires &amp; timing belt $17,995. 425-644-0523

Good Luck,
