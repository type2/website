Subject: Older Fridge unit found in junkyard (79?)

I was poking around one of the local yards the other day and came across 
a Dometic Model RC152 standalone fridge.  If anyone on the list has an 
interest in it I'll find out how much they want for it.  It looks like 
it's intact, but I can't vouch for it's running ability.  I have an 81 
and have no use for it.  It's sitting in a 79 bus which has had some 
connections cut at the floor, but I don't know whether it actually came 
from this bus or not.
Jack
