Subject: Cool Auction Score!

Went to a bankruptcy auction today. I felt sorry for the couple, but I 
knew someone would buy their stuff. Why not me?

For my $15.50 I managed to score one of those aluminum flywheels (someone
whined that he didn't see it go on sale and it was worth $100), 2 vacuum
advance distributors, a stock voltage regulator, an adjustable (still in
box) voltage regulator, an EMPI oil pump with attachment for an external
filter, three filters, new tailpipe clamps, three VDO speedometers (one
probably good) for bug, bug wiper motor, rocker arm, valve cover,
miscellaneous engine tin, lots of still-unidentified engine or
transmission parts--look like gears to me, a couple of chain-on bumper
hitches (to pull my 200 lb. boat once I get a trailer), miscellaneous
tools, and a bunch of other non-VW junk. It was cold and the auctioneers
were in a hurry, so I had to keep asking them to pull this box or that box
out of a building before selling everything in one lot. Guess it paid off. 

One guy managed to buy two engines (one complete but locked up) for
$27.50. I was bidding agin him, but i had to drive my Ford and wasn't
looking forward to loading the engine into the trunk by myself. That and
the fact that the engine was locked up and had some unrecognized
after-market carb on it. I looked all over it for markings but couldn't 
find any. Who knows? I probably just passed on a weber progressive or 
something.

Oh yeah, they sold a '74 &quot;convertible&quot; bug for $175. It was made
convertible with a blow torch. Only problem: it doesn't convert: top
always down. I didn't even think about bidding on that one. 8) Joe
