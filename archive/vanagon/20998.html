Subject: Re: oil temps 200what?

          when my bus was running (&amp; it will again SOON) my oil temp
          gauge read right around 180, except when stuck in traffic
          for any length of time when it would go to 210 or so.
          almost never to 250 (scary).  this was a 1600 SP in a '66
          kombi in central florida (no cool ocean breeze) 90+F.  the
          trick was installing a deep sump pan years ago.  it lowered
          the temp by 20-30 degrees.  no fooling.  will use this sump
          on my new motor when it arrives (SOON, i tell you).
