Hello Folks! My saga continues with a myriad of little misfires and no
starts. To date I've had more help from this list than from both of the
shops I've taken it (80 Vanagon-CA with CA emission controls)-and lot less
expensive. But never the less a intermittent problem exist.
List of replaced parts
1) coil
2) air flowmeter
3) cylindar head temp sensor
4) thermo time switch
5) dual relay
6) cap, rotor, wires
7) fuel pump-it was making lots of gurgitating sounds
8) ecu module (Halls control module)
9) key starter switch on steering column
.....
I've found a loose wire on the starter solenoid that both shops missed that
seem to affect the way the van idles-fixed
Wednsday it rained pretty hard here(Santa Rosa CA) and water soaked the
computer through the air vent at the rear of the passenger side of the van.
The van didn't start till I dried the compartment with a fan. It kind of
freaked me out thought it might short out the entire wiring harness. After
the blow dry it started up.
So I really don't know where to go from here, maybe another ground, but
where and how do I add a ground?

I appreciate all the help so far-it has been more help than the pros
