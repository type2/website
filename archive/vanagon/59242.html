Subject: All engines running


For everyone who knows what I'm doing on my camper,
what I can tell more...

1st engine: Heater blower
It starts it's first run weeks ago during a first test if
it works. I got it from '87 crewcab wreck. It squeaks very
loud the first seconds, but then it runs well. Nice, the
van got it's first blower.

2nd engine: Fuel pump
Nothing unusual. Runs as expected. No leaks on the fuel
system.

3rd engine: Radiator fan
First time I needed the battery. My electronic power
supply doesn't provide the current the fan needs. But the
fan runs fine on car's battery.

4th engine: The 5 Cylinder
It starts the first time yesterday after a whole days
discussion with Murphy: All, what can be done wrong,
will be done wrong. I hate him...

The starter does not turn the engine. The gear switched
in, but nothing else. Battery empty? But the lights are
still up.

I know that I painted the gearbox support, but I cleaned
the contact terminals for the ground strap. But I don't
think about the connection between the support and the
gearbox. I disconnected the ground strap from the support
and screwed it onto the gearbox itself.

The starter still do not turn the engine. I checked the
terminals at the starter. The terminal washers are painted,
who does something like this? I got this wire extension
from a friend to fit the different starter location. I
will ask him next weekend. I cleaned the washers and tried
again. Engine is turning!

I expected some noise from the fuel pump, but there is no.
I found the fuelpump relay is not working because of
missing pulses from the ignition system. I added a connector
under the dashboard for a second wiring harness from the
engine bay. On there I had to use two wires of same colour:
blue/red. What happened, they are swapped, Murphy laws.

Next try, but the fuel pump still doesn't work. I found
the fuelpump relay must be blown by my previous mistake.
I took a short wire and shortened the relay. The pump
comes up.

The engine turns, get fuel and sparks. But it fires to
everywhere. Through the whole exhaust system and into
the air cleaner box. Wow, a loud sign from the engine
that spark wires #4 and #5 were swapped. Bad mistake,
corrected it and start the engine again. Some adjustments
to find the right timing and voula:

ENGINE IS RUNNING, great sound of a 5 Cyl. out of a
Vanagon. I'm missing a small hose for the air by-pass
(the old one doesn't fit) and the engine dies at idle,
but this, at all, was a great day for me.
