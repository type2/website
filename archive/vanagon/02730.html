&gt; Hmmm... I thought the only camper option available in the US was the
&gt; &quot;weekender&quot;, which has a small wannabe-fridge under one of the seats.
&gt; It's not a true fridge, but one of those thermostatic or whatever thingies
&gt; that only cools 40 degrees below the outside air temp.  So if it is
&gt; 90 degrees inside your camper your food will spoil :(
&gt; 

Yeah...that's why I was surprised. This vehicle was NOT a '94 weekender. 
It was a full blown camper style with frig., shower thingee in the rear, 
pop top....and Norcold frig....1995 model.
