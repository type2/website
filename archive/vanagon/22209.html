Subject: Re: crankcase sealant

&gt;&gt;For mating the crankcase halves Muir says VW case glue or &gt;&gt;No. 2 Permatex.
 I bought the latter _I think_. To be exact, &gt;&gt;the box says 'Permatex
FORM-A-GASKET No. 2 SEALANT ... &gt;&gt;nonhardening pliable sealant'.  Is this OK
to use?   The VW &gt;&gt;stuff gets hard pretty quickly, Muir says.

People who should know at the shop where I buy my parts said to use
Gasgacinch.  I haven't tried it yet.  Anyone know if it works?  I'd
appreciate knowing before I try it on my 40HP.
