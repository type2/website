Subject: oil for a 2 litre air cooled  F.I. engine

I have been running 10-30 dinosaur oil for the last ten months. Now I am
embarking on a trip through the United States on two North.  Should I use
the current blend, or should I use something like 15-40 or its equivalent?
Even if you don't currently own an air cooled version of German perfection
or not , and you have had experience with air cooled oilmotors please
respond.
