Subject: techie.phys.sfu_dot_edu up?

Has anyone been in touch with this site in the past week?  I been 
trying for a couple of hours, and had tried a time or three in the past 
week with no response.  Skip Montanaro's www server is up, but cannot 
connect and an attempt to get there via FTP also failed.  Anyone around 
this listserv from sfu?
