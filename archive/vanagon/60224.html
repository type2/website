&gt;     Okay-
&gt;  I'm a first-time Vanagon Westfalia owner (91 Westfalia with all 
&gt;the  options - but have owned VWs all my life).  Question is, can I 
&gt;expect  much out of the Air conditioner or the fridge (on 12V)?

   Blaine, in my experience, even if the AC's fully charged, in a Westy
you're expecting quite a lot, especially if the van's been sitting in the
sun for very long.  It's adequate, if you begin using the thing before
the van has had a chance to become hot as an oven.
All in all though, here in Atlanta, we're better off with it than
without.

   The 12 volt setting on the fridge is designed for maintaining an
already cooled fridge, not for cooling down a warm one.  Before leaving
on a trip, I plug the van in overnight, then in the morning,
fill the fridge with pre-chilled items, and switch to 12 volts before
leaving.  If we're making an extended stop while underway, I'll switch it
over to propane and park with the fridge side out of direct sun.
