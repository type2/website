&gt;   Could someone tell me more about this &quot;piston-slap problem&quot;?  I guess it's
&gt;   rather common with the Eurovan?

The sypmtom is a diesel-like sound from the engine on cold starts.
Depending on severity, it can very very faint or very audible.
Someone sent me a description of the problem and the problem # as
listed by VWOA (Ric?), but I must have deleted that piece of mail,
I cannot find it.
anybody got it out there?
