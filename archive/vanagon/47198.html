Subject: Re: '93 Eurovan

Hi all,

My EV has 34k happy miles on it. I love this van and so does my family. It
is absolutely the best vehicle I've ever owned for long-distance travel. To
date I've had my pistons replaced due to &quot;piston slap&quot; (done by VW at no
charge to me) and the relays for my windshield wipers had to be replaced.
That's it. Oh, the seal on the passenger side door starts whistling at about
55 mph.

34k miles is still pretty low, so I wouldn't draw any conclusions yet.

&gt;&gt;I've had lots of trouble with my 93 EV in the past (thankfully), but it's a
&gt;&gt;5-speed.  Lately I love mine.  It just turned over 42K miles and is still
&gt;&gt;running well.
