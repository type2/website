&gt; Our new baby ('81 Westy) just got its report card from the mechanic.  I
&gt; lost track of the dollar amount that it is going to run, but I think it's
&gt; safe to say we won't be going on that round the world trip anytime soon.
&gt; Actually, there is little wrong with the engine, per se (except some
&gt; misguided previous owner removed the cooling flaps from the engine and to
&gt; replace them is $350), but the fuel lines need replacing ($375) and the
&gt; brake rotors need replacing (I'm not sure how much this is going to run
&gt; us).  Plus we need a lot of other long term stuff done (front shocks, etc.)

ALL of this work except for the rotors can be done yourself. Replacing
the fuel line is easy on the 81 because the bulk of the fuel system is
metal tubing not fuel line- just that portion that runs from the tank to the
regulator at the back...and then back to the tank- not a difficult job
if you have a decent manual.

&gt; My first suggestion is to scout around for a decent VW parts shop,
there are a few on coast towards SF...

&gt; He mentioned a few things that are just expensive because VW parts are such
&gt; a rip-off.  Does anyone think I would have much luck getting the following
&gt; things from a junkyard?
&gt; 
&gt; Driver's side window regulator

junk yard - no problem
&gt; Sliding door locking mechanism
junk yard &gt; 

replacment muffler (can we replace the muffer ourselves or is this a pro job?)
&gt; 
yes and it would be cheaper (only the exhaust headers are expensive,
because they rarely break).

EGR box
&gt;
maybe but scout around for a new onw or call Kohlweiss in Menlo Park.

 windsheild (we have two small cracks in ours)
if these are star shaped consider fixing them yourself

&gt; engine cooling flaps
important w/without a thermosat.

&gt; 
&gt; I would appreciate advice from the wise ones on the net as to which if any
&gt; of these parts will be practical to get from junkyard dealers.
If you need a name of a SF area junkyard with vanagons let me know....DC&gt;
