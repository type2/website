Subject: RE: Greasy Kid Stuff in a '90 Vanagon


&gt;I've had some sort of grease leaking into my van from where the utility
&gt;shelf hits the clothes closet.  Does anyone understand what this is and
&gt;where it comes from?

Remember that candle you couldn't find at the last camping trip?
Weather's warming up-- now you know where it went.   :^)
