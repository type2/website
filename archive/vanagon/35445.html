Subject: Re: Heat Ex. Ques. '79 bus


HI Dave. California Import Parts is a company out of Vancouver, B.C. 
Their the main supplier of all my parts for my westy. I've had no 
problems since I've been buying from them. Everyone that works there are 
vw enthsiasts so they know what their talking about.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 	I am trying to order some heat exchangers for a '79 bus and since 
&gt; they appear to be a one year only, I am having a hard time finding them.  
&gt; One place has a &quot;type4 heat exchanger for '79&quot; but it is for the 
&gt; 411/412.  Will this work on a bus?  (I'm guessing that it won't, but I 
&gt; wanted to check to see before counting it out.) 
&gt; 
&gt; 	A place called CA Import Parts LTD has the correct exchangers but 
&gt; they are $40 more apiece than the ones above. If I need to go here has 
&gt; anyone dealt with them and what do you think about them?
&gt; 
&gt; 	I am hoping to order these today so that I will have them by the 
&gt; middle of next week so I can get this bus back together and back on the 
&gt; road. 
&gt;  
&gt; Thanks in advance for any help.
