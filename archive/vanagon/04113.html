Yeah, Ric.  I do remember Redding - GROSS!

Some of the more chronoligically-gifted of us on the list (b. 1954)
DO on rare occasions get a detail wrong here and there (like
ittsy biitsy bikinis, and no, I won't be posing in mine in front
of the vanagon on the brick tour, in fact if I don't get a little
more respect around here, I may add long underwear under the flannel
shirt, plus some hiking boots).  Anyway, vag-north-hemispherians
have so much going on in their heads most of the time anyway,
that we sometimes let an inaccuracy slip, but it is because of
the large volume of QUALITY information we have in there fighting
for space in the temporal lobes.  OK, more songs:

Hot-Rod Lincoln
Beep-Beep
Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavor on the Bedpost Over Night?
