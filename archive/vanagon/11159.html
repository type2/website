Subject: Another coolant leak!

Well, this morning I found a small puddle near the side door of 
my 85 Vanagon near where the A/C condensate line usually drips.

&quot;Hmm .. That's strange, I haven't been using the air conditioner
in months&quot;, I thought, while remembering how I promised myself 
to run it every two weeks to keep the seals from drying out.

On closer inspection, the liquid turned out to be engine coolant!

Seems the rear heater core under the back seat developed a leak
and proceeded to drip precious blue stuff all over the floor
boards.  It had run under the foam pads beneath the carpet and
eventually found its way through the floor and into the D-beam
that runs along the right hand side.  Finally leaked to the floor
near the A/C drain.

Anybody got ideas for repairing heater cores?  How about sources
for new or rebuilt cores?
