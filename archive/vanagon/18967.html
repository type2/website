Howdy

	Well, at Bug O Rama I bought an ashtray for the bus 'cause the
clips on mine were busted.  When I got it home, I promptly put it in my 
home-brew acid-bath to clean it up a bit.  I promptly forgot about it.  I
took it out yesterday, and said clips were gone, and the whole aparatus
was several ounce ligther than when I started....  Oh well, $2 down the
drain...
	
	I have 2 acid baths, in 40qt tubs (with lids) one is Hydrocloric
Acid and the other Phosphoric.  I put the really rusty stuff in the
HCL first, and then in the phosphoric bath.  This last weekend I cleaned
up some wheels I bought for my SO's BMW at the junkyard, soaking them
in the phosphoric bath for about 3 hours each, and they cleaned up like
new!
