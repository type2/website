All:

Sorry but I must vent on this one.  I pay a flat rate for I-way access (some
people pay by the minute) but I do have to contend with a bitchy roommate
for phone time.  Anyway, the moral is this:  Don't spam the list with large
attachments, GIFs, JPeGs, pictures of your cat, whatever.  I have [T1] and
[T2] busses and a [14.4K] connection at home.  I don't wanna see a picture
of a hitch for a [T3].  Besides that, I couldn't really see it anyway.  If
you REALLY have to mail a picture at least convert it to a .JPG first.  I
got a 320K message that contained a 236K GIF that I compressed to a 44K JPG.
Hmmm.

Maybe post a message asking if anyone is interested in such a picture and
e-mail it to them directly.
