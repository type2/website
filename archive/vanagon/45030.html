&gt; ...                                                    I've always run my VWs
&gt; on el cheapo 87 octane gas with no problems, no pinging, etc.  Anybody that
&gt; puts 91 octane in the tank of a VW is just burning money, in my opinion.  Of
&gt; course, in the event that I am wrong, someone please correct me!

one thing to remember about OLD vw's is that the u.s. has changed its method
of labeling gasoline octane: what USED to be 91 octane in the &quot;old days&quot;
(back in the 60's) is NOW 87 octane. so, yes, VW's are designed to run on
the lower pump octane (87) that is available NOW.

but many people &quot;feel&quot; that the higher grades of gasoline give them more
performance, cleaner engines, less trouble, better smelling exhaust, and/or
whiter teeth. ;)  it's their money, their choice. :)

the point is that if you have an older VW and you read the owner's manual
and it says &quot;91 octane&quot;, be careful to look at which KIND of octane ...
usually it's &quot;91 RON octane&quot; which is the old way of figuring octane. the
new equivalent is &quot;87 (RON+MON)/2&quot; (or some folks call it AKI octane rating).
