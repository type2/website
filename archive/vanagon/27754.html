&gt;The kit will give you a whopping extra 2311cc in capacity (to around 19100cc
&gt;from memory) and is probably the biggest bang for buck you can get with a
&gt;1700.

Uh I think I should make that 'a whopping 231.1 cc in capacity (to around
1910.0 cc from memory)'....doesn't seem to matter as much when you leave them
off the end of a sentence....
