Subject: Mailer problem -- sorry

I created a link to a different spool file today, since I was
running out of space.  I guess Solaris doesn't like that.  I suspect that
many of you had bounced mail messages from natasha, my Sun at home.
Hopefully, they are gone now.  The whole directory of /var/mail is
now a link, with real files under it.  Sigh.  I sometimes hate unix,
in its many variants!
