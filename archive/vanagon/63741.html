&gt;&gt; I would appreciate any suggestions from my venerable Seattle area
Vanagon
&gt;&gt; brethern for reliable, capable and economical Seattle (preferably
north
&gt;&gt; Seattle) VW repair shops specializing in watercooled Vanagons.  

Carter does know their VW Vanagons. They also know just how much $$ they
can get away with charging for used ones. When I was first looking for a
Westie I spent some time in their lots but the sticker shock almost sent
me into a coma. But I digress.

The shop that comes with the best recommendations for VW's by people I
know is Louis Foreign Auto at 7310 Roosevelt Way NE (ph 524-3366).
