Subject: need exhaust system for 87 syncro

The exhaust system on my 87 syncro has just about rotted out.  I've taken it
to a local muffler shop and the guy refuses to put a blow torch to it.  The
dealer advises that it wil cost many $$$$$$$ to replace the exhaust pipes.  I
am unaware of any after-market manufacturers who make exhaust parts for
syncros.  All the local salvage yards are devoid of a single syncro.  

Any Ideas Here????  I am completely frustrated at the prosptect of paying big
bucks for exhaust piping but as things stand I don't seem to have much
choice.   

All ideas welcome.

thanks
