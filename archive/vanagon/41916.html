Subject: siezing brakes (was: '68 front-end into '59 Bus? Disc brakes?)


&gt;The discs will go straight onto the '68 beam as well. Although you
&gt;should really change the master cylinder for the one with the pressure
&gt;release (Jim (BB) might be able to advise.). Any conversion from drums
&gt;to discs requires the corresponding master cylinder. This is because
&gt;the hydraulic system for discs means that the pads are in, almost,
&gt;constant contact with the discs. In town driving the hydraulic fluid
&gt;can expand, and without compensation for this expansion, the system
&gt;can become pressurised into locking the pads on and you get to a
&gt;seized state.
&gt;
&gt;The point is whilst I know a lot of people that have done the disc
&gt;swap thing, none of them have experienced the seizing problem but I
&gt;have heard about it several times on beetles.


I have run into this several times, on '66-older beetles. Never seen
it on a bus, although maybe that's because I'd finally gotten it through
my head that I shouldn't adjust the shoes right up next to the drums, and
so never caused the problem any more by the time I got into buses.

Is this why it happens on older beetles, but (apparently) not on '67-newer
ones? Do newer beetles have such a pressure-relief doohickey? Where- in
the master cylinder? From your post, I guess buses had the same problem,
and solution? In what year did the pressure-relief start, for buses and/or
bugs?
