Subject: Everybody sing!


To the tune of &quot;Hanky Panky&quot;. My baby loves her new engine! My baby 
loves her new engine! My baby loves her new engine! My baby loves her 
new engine! Yahoo! The engine is in the '81 Westy and she purrs like a
kitten!!!! Only took about 18 hours to do the job. So how come it 
takes 3 to drop the engine and forever to put it back together? Anyway
it was worth all of the effort. Can't wait to road test her this 
afternoon. Thanks for all of the help and suggestions to every one of 
you! Will write and tell you of our adventures in it the next 2 weeks,
we're on vacation! Yip, yip yipee!
Lisa
