Subject:      finding new listmembers

Ever see another great looking vanagon/eurovan and
think....hmmmmm, they should be on the list.  Well, here is a
little invitation i leave on their window.  I think we especially
need more Eurovan owners.  Anyway, i leave it in my wallet.

Am i &quot;VW&quot; crazed now or what?

PS.....any suggestions for improving my note?



Nice Van!

Thought you might be interested in joining the Vanagon/Eurovan
chat group.  We also own VW vans and talk about:  problems/fixes;
likes/dislikes; travelling; and ask questions/share answers.  It
really is a community.  The listserver (an email chat group) is
nonprofit and free.  If you are interested check out
www.vanagon_dot_com under mailing lists or email me at
chrilow_at_enoreo.on_dot_ca.

Good Day Eh.
