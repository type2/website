Subject: Joel Change the Stats! '77 Westy

hey now,

well....amanda and i put a deposit down on this beautiful orange '77
westy today. thanks to stefan for his help on inspecting it.....much
much muchly appreciated. the interior on this van is perfect. no rips,
tears, etc. the pop up canvas is in excellent shape..with just one or
two tiny holes. i was quite suprised. the only thing missing is the pump
and water tank. anyone got some spares they'd like to sell me? :-)

the engine sounds great. we determined that the starter is okay..but the
solenoid is bad. we could get power to the starter by hooking it to the
battery. it turned but didn't catch. will have to work on that. one cv
boot is cracked and will have to be replaced. i have a whole extra
transaxle for a '74...will that work on a '77? all lights except the
brake lights work. we will have to work on that as well. no rocker panel
rust or any floor rust. a couple small places on the body have be derusted
and need a bit more work. but on the whole, the van is virtually rust free.

to get the van started, we had to push start it, started immediately even
though it has sat for a year. the 2.0 engine has power! wow, i was impressed!
good brakes, steering is good. ball joints and tie rods look good. timing
was right on. compression couldn't be tested because we couldn't start
the van without rolling it. but i think it will be okay. needs an oil change.
we had to adjust the clutch because whoever put the clutch cable on didn't
do it right. no biggy.

the passenger seat does indeed swivel. the owner was suprised. had a top end
engine rebuild i think 10,000 miles ago. can't remeber exactly. van has
160,000 miles on it.

he was asking $1600. got it down to $1450. left him a $100 deposit and will
get the rest to him monday. yahhhhhhhooooo!

i missed the threads on cleaning westy tops. what's the best way?
