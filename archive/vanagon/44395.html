Bill,

I'm very happy that you found something of value in the articles.  But I only
wrote the things.  Mr. Richard Kurtz took the trouble to collect and archive
them, expending his own time and money to do so.  (rmk_at_sky_dot_net)

I bought a low-time '70 Ghia for my wife.  She loves it more'n me :-)  I'm
more the bus type.  All of the articles were first uploaded to the Vanagon
List, which is open to all. (vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu .... for distribution,
'listserv' to speak to the controller program.)

-Bob
