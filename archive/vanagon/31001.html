Well the 71 Westy is back together.  I'm not sure I fixed an oil leak or not
but I am please it still runs after tearing it down to a long-block and
reassembling it.  Discovered a CV-Joint split boot while re-attaching stuff
underneath.  Needs to be replaced before my January run to the left coast.

The Bugs still runs, so I will let it alone and tackle the 70 Bus clutch
tomorrow.  I did the 71 Westy outside, except for the motor work.  I'll
make space for the 70 before the predicted 5&quot; snowfall tomorrow night.

Hope I get all of these running soon.  Only six more shopping days till
Christmas.

Richard
