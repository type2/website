&gt;Local VW salesman says that the Eurovan is *not* selling. (I went in to say
&gt;&quot;hi&quot; to him - he sold us our Vanagon, and he twisted my arm into test
&gt;driving a Eurovan (sporty model, rear-facing-removable-mid-seats, special
&gt;paint).  It was interesting... strange to hear the motor up front (and it's
&gt;not particularly quiet).  The salesman said that he'd skip the VR6 and go
&gt;with the work-horse (Audi) 5-cylinder, if it were up to him.
&gt;Can we have the Vanagon back? (VW start manufacture again...) Are Vanagon's
&gt;still being made?  Will the dies be shipped to Mexico and Brazil to bring
&gt;them into the '80s?

from what i gather, looking at and thru some of the junk i've got, the only
place that is still (maybe, just maybe) making the vanagon-body is South
Africa ... which drives on the, ahem, other side of the road (so the steering
wheel is opposite as well).  as far as i can tell, the vanagon-body was never
built in Mexico or Brazil (they are STILL making the bread-loaf body, but
with a water-cooled engine!! and a strange extra big square grill up front).

i guess those of us who like the vanagon (and don't particularly care for the
eurovan ... the driver's position felt cramped to me, and i kept hitting my
head on the a-pillar getting in) had better start gathering 'em up about us.
before they start getting rare, like the old split-window buses. :(
