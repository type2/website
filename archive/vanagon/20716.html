Subject: 1971 Bus Engine Number/No Idle

Hi! I'm a new bus owner (though I've owned one in the past) and I can't
figure out where my engine came from. Instead of the standard  AE-0-000-001
number, I've got  an engine number of AD with no trailing numbers. Was this
some sort of aftermarket case? Does anyone know?

I'm also having trouble getting the idle right...actually, I can't get it
to idle at all. I've gone through the carb rebuild, checked points and
plugs, checked intake boots for cracks (visually), etc. I'm planning on the
valve adjustment this PM. ?Could there be a correlation between valve
adjustment and idle, or am I fishing in the wrong pond? (I haven't done the
compression check because I have the aux heater and my compression gauge
won't fit in the suspect #4 cylinder...but I'm planning on getting a gauge
that will fit.) If I do get the 8-( dreaded rebuild high sign, should I
scrap this case and look for another, true '71 or later?

BTW, does the list netiquette request a bio? I'll be happy to send one if
so. (I joined the list yesterday.)

Thanks! Joe
