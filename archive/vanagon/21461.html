Subject:      didn't get much traffic today??

well, if you didn't get much traffic from the list today, it's cause the
software crashes every time gerry goes out of town. :)  and, of course,
he went off on vacation.

but finally i was able to get through to some of the other guys up there
and get them to restart it (but it was about 1930 before it got refired)
... so if you sent something out today, and it didn't make it (and it
looks like nothing did), then please send it again.

sorry for the delay, folks ... but i had to go pay for the dentist's other
kid's tuition. :(

joel
