Subject: Re: clutch cylinder - help

The rubber boot on my slave cylinder popped about a month ago, shooting 
hydraulic fluid everywhere, and locking me out of gear.  Also, the 
plastic bearing shot down the pinion shaft, which required removal of the 
transmission for reattachment.  All this just because of a blown 
slave cylinder.

&gt; &gt; One thing that bugs me is the &quot;linkage&quot; between the clutch slave cylinder
&gt; &gt; and the clutch lever seems to be missing.  It was never complete since I
&gt; &gt; have owned the van.  It was kind of home rigged, and I don't know what the
&gt; &gt; real setup looks like.  Pictures in the Bentley are pretty vague.  All
&gt; &gt; there is now is a steel rod pushing on the ball on the clutch lever.  I

&gt; Steel rod should have a socket assembly on its end that pushes on the 
&gt; ball on the lever.  Best sign to rebuild, when they leak, 
&gt; particularly the slave.  Change the fluid out with your brake fluid 
&gt; every 2 years.  And a good hint, work on and remove the slave from 
&gt; the engine compartment, MUCH easier, on air cooled you are forced to 
&gt; work from below.
