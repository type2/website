&gt;On the road yesterday, I saw a very late Vanagon in Carat
&gt;     trim. The interior layout was unusual; club seating.
&gt;     Two rear facing seats backed up behind the driver and shotgun
&gt;     seats. The usual three person bench in back. If I'm not
&gt;     mistaken there was a table set up between the two rows of
&gt;     rear seats. Seems great for a family with kids, they can all
&gt;     color or whatever on the table in backlike our son does in
&gt;     the Westie, but it still seats seven.
&gt;
&gt;     My neighbor likes the idea. Is this a standard configuration
&gt;     on the Carat? If not, what is the configuration called? What do we
&gt;     search the ads for?
&gt;
&gt;     Can you get a carat with a stick ;-)?

Tom,
This seating arrangement can be found in Vanagons from 1987 to 1991.
In 1987, 1988, &amp; 1989 it was in the Vanagon GL Wolfsburg Limited Edition
vans.
It turned out to be popular enough to make it into a &quot;regular&quot; model.  
So, in 1989, 1990, &amp; 1991 it was in the Vanagon Carat.
Yes, in 1989 it was both in the Carat and WLE versions.
Automatic transmission was optional in all of these models.
