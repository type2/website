Subject: Re: for robert brown: borla exhausts (stainless steel)

&gt;and also for all vanagons ...
&gt;

&gt;or air-cooled) right now, BUT &lt;drum-rolllllllll&gt; IF anybody orders 20 or more
&gt;of them, they WILL make them. said it would take about six weeks to get the
&gt;specs, gear up, and fit it into the schedule.  the 20 units is the minimum
&gt;order for special stuff.

&lt;snip&gt;  $200....

Joel,   was this offer for mufflers only, or would they bend up SS tubing 
into the 3 pieces we need, from cyl. heads to catholicperverter?
         And... question # 2) Does the 2.1litre exhaust system fit on the 
1.9litre engine. The reason I ask is that my '87 requires only one brace to 
support the pipes, while the '85 has (had!) six or seven braces. I'd 
consider ordering 2 '87 systems, without mufflers, if the price was right 
&lt;$300/set.
         And further more... anyone else ever seen stainless steel J-tubes? 
J-tubes will fit the front exhaust ports nicely, lots of weld-up needed for 
back ports.  tim s.
