Subject: Re: Decreasing Gear Ratio

OK, I'm confused.  What is meant by final drive ratio?
I understood FD to be overall engine revolutions per tire rotation.  
Is it:

        FD = R&amp;P * 4th ?

or 

        FD = R&amp;P ?

where   FD = final drive ratio
        R&amp;P = ring and pinion gear ratio
        4th = 4th gear size

or none-of-the-above?  If the latter, how does one compute
engine revs / tire rotation?

On a related matter, in the equation that was posted previously,
I was also confused with regard to measuring the rolling radius 
of a tire.  I derived an equivalent equation that may be easier
to measure:

                CIRC * RPM
        MPH = --------------
                1056 * FD

where   CIRC = distance traveled by one tire rotation [inches]
        RPM = engine revolutions measured on your VDO
        FD = engine revolutions per tire rotation (R&amp;P * 4th? )

I found a local shop that will rebuild my tranny for me.  I'm
considering having them install a lower ratio ring and pinion,
and then widening the spacing of the 4 gears, so that I recover
the mountain ability and acceleration of the current 1st and 
2nd, and then use the existing low 4th gear (.82 ?) for good highway
mileage and low revs.  Any comments?  Has anyone had this done?
