Subject: 84 Westy propane problem

Hi all,
I'm new to the list and just purchased an 84 Westy.  Was hoping to take the
kids camping this week but noticed that propane was leaking after filling and
bleeding the tank.  Seems to be coming from a small pinhole below red
button(? safety valve) on inlet valve. Do I need a new valve? Don't want to
blow the thing up on its maiden voyage!

Any help would be much appreciated.
