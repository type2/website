&gt; How about the vintagVW crowd as well? We could set the trip itinerary,
&gt; then invite all VWers??

I plan on posting notices to the VW groups when we are a little farther
along in the planning stages.  I am also going to write letters to all of
the clubs in case they happen to be having any events that we can hit. 
Also, Dr. Carment and I are eventually going to work on a letter to be
sent to VW of America and VW of Canada.
