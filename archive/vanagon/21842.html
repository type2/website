Subject:       Re: Vanagon refridge runs in heat!?


&gt; Last week someone described a senario wherein their Vanagon Westy
&gt; refridgerator would &quot;run&quot; even though the &quot;C&quot; switch was set according to
&gt; the instructions on the refridge door (Gas=off, not 120v, not 12v). I
&gt; noticed the post but didn't pay attention to it. Well, guess what. I have
&gt; joined the club. The thing tends to run whenever it wants (heat of the day).
&gt; It has not occured yet at night when it cools off to only 105 degrees or so.
&gt; The refridge is not cold inside at all. Is this a safety feature to prevent
&gt; the freon or propane from blowing up the bus? If it is related to the freon
&gt; why is this safety item not available on vehicles with regular air
&gt; conditioners?

BECAUSE the thermostat that controls the fridge fan is wired to a 
continual 12v, not going thru the panel switch.  if your van be hot, then 
it comes on.  cool, huh?

one could pull the fuse behind the drivers seat to stop it.   or just 
live in a cold climate like some of us  :)
