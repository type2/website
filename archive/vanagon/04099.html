&gt; A run of my mbox through the spell checker produced this
&gt; relatively inane, and useless info:
&gt; 
&gt; Westfalia
&gt; Westfallia
&gt; Westphalia
&gt; WESTY
&gt; Westy
&gt; westy
&gt; Westys

Both the first and third terms are correct. The first spelling is the
americanized version applied to the German made people carrier, I suppose
named
for the place of manufacture. The term using ph is the European spelling
for the place of the same name in which the Treaty of Westphalia was
signed in 1648 (thus ending the 30 years War). This treaty conferred sovereign
independence on
princes and basically set in motion the modern nation state system we know
today (thereby allowing such states like the US to exist so its
peoples could freely and democratically
simplify  apparently complicated words using ph).

class dismissed - DC

&gt;  &gt; I seem to remember
this spelling question on the ACT...... &gt;
