Subject: RE: Alloy wheel deal

WAIT...
	
	before any one buys these wheels...

	are you aware that the Audi 5000 is a front wheel drive car??

	the off-set is totally opposite from rear wheel drive vehicles such as
Vanagons...
	the incorrect off-set will cause numerous problems such as strange tire
wear, incorrect wheel bearing loading ( premature failure...), may
affect handling...

	so before you buy, check with a tire/wheel expert to see if the
difference in off-set will work on your Vanagon...

	I personally would not do it...
