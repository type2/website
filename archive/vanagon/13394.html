&gt; No engine.  It is in superb shape.  The guy wants $3500 for it.  
My brother just bought a `58 23-window (disassembled, but complete.) for
$995, but it probably needs a lot more work than this one.
&gt; 
&gt; I have to go look at it and make a deposit by 2:00 MST or else another guy is
&gt; going to get it.
I'm always leery when someone tries to rush me into a decision. If they won't
let you take your time, they might be hiding things
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone has _any_ suggestions, mail me now!  I really appreciate it!
&gt; 
&gt; Is this price in line with the rest of the country (excluding CA, of
&gt; course!)?
There was another `58 23-window for about 1,000 bucks here. Not sure 
about the completeness of it, but the ad said it ran. Usually they go
for about 2-3K in good running condition here in WA state, if you can
find onw for sale. But, if your hands are trembling, and you can miss
next month's mortgage payment, I'd say go for it!
