Subject:      Norcold High Elevation Kit - Eurovan

Canadian Thanksgiving was the occasion of our first camping trip since
adding the high-elevation kit to the Norcold fridge.  I would like to
ask the other listees who have made this modification whether they had
our experience.

The weekend was unnaturally warm.  In order not to freeze food (yes,
really) we have to set our thermostat at about &quot;5 o'clock&quot; on the dial.
 We found that the diode on the panel would &quot;drop out&quot; from time to
time, and the fridge would make repeated clicking sounds, then reignite.
 This was especially apparent (and annoying) at night.

Can it be that the second exterior vent is leaning the mixture too much?
 We were at the Bruce Peninsula National Park, which I estimate to be
300 feet above sea level.  Were you given any special instructions with
the elevation kit on proper operation at low elevations?
