 I've had the &quot;stubborn starter&quot; phenomenon on two of the three buses I've 
 owned, and I've spent plenty of money on parts foolishly. The problem has
 always ended up right where Steve Maher has said it is. In addition to   
 the need to tighten the grip that the connector has on it's mate, on my
 72 the crimp where the wire is joined to the terminal had corroded/loosened
 enough &lt;same terminal at starter solenoid&gt; that a significant voltage drop
 occured across it. I cleaned the junction with acid flux &lt;it was really ugly&gt;,
 soldered the wire to the terminal and washed it all off with water laced
 with baking soda. End of problem. Cost of repair: Zip. 

 Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that the problem occurs here. That junction
 is exposed to both the weather and spray thrown up by the rear wheels. There
 is motion as well since the end of the wire is connected to the
 engine vibrating and moving on it's mounts and a short distance away the 
 harness is secured to the chassis.
