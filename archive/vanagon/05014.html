Subject: water pump for 76 Westy

I just had all my camper stuff checked out.  Replaced the aux battery, filled
the LP tank, etc.

2 snags still unresolved:

1) The water pump is getting juice but is dead. :-(
Anyone know where I can get a replacement?
Is it a hassle to install? (I'm a very MINOR mechanic).

2) The fuse in the control panel where the battery recharge timer is located is
missing.  What kind of fuse does it take and where do I get one? ( I'm guessing
this is why the battery recharge isn't working. BTW, the fridge has been
removed).
