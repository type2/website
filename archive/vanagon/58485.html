Subject: Re: Needed: Rear Chrome Bumper for 86 Sy

The bumper looks good without the strip.  I'm trying to find some
chrome bolts as the original fasteners are now exposed.  fit was
marginal to the end caps.  Although I bought end caps too, so the
fit problem could be the caps, not the bumper.

considering the price I'm satisfied.
