Yessir, they do!

And don't forget to replace the seal INSIDE the cup in the flywheel and to
put a wee smear of Moly grease in the input shaft pilot bearing. 

If you don't have the contraption to *meaure the end play* once you have
bolted up the flywheel don't bolt up the clutch until you've rented (or taken
the engine to someone who has) one of these. Too much or too little endplay
will ruin the mainshaft bearings thrust faces in short order. You will change
one of the shims if the end play is wrong.

Best o' luck,
