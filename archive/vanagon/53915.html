Subject: CCC's Tahoe 1/17-19


The Tahoe trip is on, yes.  I'll be forwarding you the directions
Jeffrey Carver has given to me soon.  In the meantime, be thinking
about your potluck culinary contributions.  The theme this time
for the weekend is &quot;Asian.&quot;  PLEASE don't everyone bring top
ramen.  :)
