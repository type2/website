Subject: Smelly (burning wire/plastic) Fridge Question

So I have a &quot;new&quot; 90 Westy.... low miles and refrig little used.  I fired it
up on propane and it smells a little like warm / burning plastic or
wiring.... Any suggestions?  Could it just be residue or ?? from not much
use???

TIA, James
