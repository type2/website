SUPERCEDES TECHNICAL BULLETIN 24-92-01 (February 29, 1992)

CONDITION
After driving for an extended period of time at a constant speed, the
vehicle may, on occasion, experience a deterioration of performance
which may be accompanied by a hestiation or surging.

In many cases, after turning off the engine and subsequent re-start or
without having taken any action, the symptoms disappear.  These symptoms
may not recur for several weeks or months.

SERVICE
To resolve this condition, wire harness Part No. 025 906 302, should be
installed.  This harness provides improved signal voltage stablization.
* remove electrical connector from air flow sensor
* install wire harness, Part No. 025 906 302, between main harness
  connetion and air flow sensor connection.
*****************************************************************
* CAUTION                                                       *
* Part numbers are for reference only.  Always check with your  *
* Parts Department for latest information.                      *

NOTE
When troubleshooting this system and performing continuity checks, the
following should be noted.  Due to active components in the wire
harness, Part No. 025 906 302, there is not continuity between pin two
of the connectors.  The following chart on page 2 lists the resistence
of each circuit.
  ---------------------------------------------
  Terminal      Approximate
  Number        Resistance
  ---------------------------------------------
    1           Zero Ohms
    2           Greater than 1 Meg. Ohms
    3           Zero Ohms
    4           Zero Ohms
    5           Zero Ohms

NOTE
If customer complaints persist after performing the above repair,
contact your Zone Product Support Specialist for assistance.

........................... end ......................................
harness costs about $100! very simple to install. takes about three
minutes maximum. the new harness fits between the old harness and the
silver air-flow meter box attached to the air cleaner box. remove the
silver clip, wiggle out the big wiring connector (from the side of the
air-flow meter), connect the proper end of the new harness to the big
big wiring connector you just wiggled out, put the new clip into the
new connection; then take the other end of the new harness and plug it
into the air-flow meter connection. put the silver clip back. and you
are done.
