&gt;I used to have a Coleman handwarmer as a paper boy in Illinois.  Worked on
&gt;the same principle, about the size of a cigarette pack.  It had a cloth
&gt;case and a hole in the metal to light a cigarette.  Used to carry it in my
&gt;pocket on sub-zero days and it worked great.

I used one of these in Colorado in my '69 bus for a few winters, and it
did indeed work great. It was called a &quot;Jon-e-warmer&quot;, and came in two
different sizes, from a sporting-goods store. As far as I know, they are
still available.


&gt; Wish I still had it, but I
&gt;doubt if it is EPA or OSHA or FCC or SEC or FDA approved.  Maybe GOP will
&gt;bring em back.

It would make sense.
