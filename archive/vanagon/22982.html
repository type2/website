Subject: RE: Oil Temperature Gauge/ air cooled bus

re temp gauge: the VDO model works well enough, if you run the supplied wire
through the firewall, over the axle, and into the passenger compartment. It
just barely reaches.

re oil pressure sender: VDO has a dual connection model that lets you keep
the light in the circuit as well. But it is very wide diameter - too wide
to fit into the hole left in the tin by the other - also it rubs against
the distributor making it hard to get a good seal. Solution: brass tubing
with tapered pipe thread to lift the connection point above the tin, with a
45 degree angle connector to tilt the sender away from the distributor.
Seems to work well.

re oil temp sender: the VDO model screws right into the drain plug hole on
the air cooled Vanagon - no need to drill the sump plate.

re tach: very easy to connect the VDO model, just a wire to the coil I
think it was.

re mounting them: again, VDO makes a part which is a big multi-holed piece
of black rubber, with an angled edge. Once its installed it looks nice than
it sounds, and because its rubber its harder to hurt yourself on it.
I put mine on the lower edge of the dash, near the center, positioned so that
the steering wheel doesn't block my view of them. Moving them any further
to the right is out of the question - already I'm trying to decide which
gauge to move out there because my oil temp gauge is out there right now
and I get a skewed reading from it with stretching.
Setup now is like this:
head temp : tach : oil press : oil temp : voltage : spare (for 2nd batt?)
Looks like a damn cockpit in there now. Another nice thing is I can read
the gauges from the back of the bus while accessing the engine. (Okay, I'm
a slightly farsighted!)

There seems to be a common thread here. I just bought VDO gauges, and payed
dearly for them I'm afraid, but they work and look good. I made up for the
price by installing them all myself - and after the usual 5 trips to the
hardware and FLAPS I got it all together.

And for those that remember my earlier postings - I've switched to straight
30W oil on the advice of a local mechanic who insisted that 20W-50 could
blow the oil filter off! It *seems* to run a little cooler as a result, but
that was only in the city - I haven't given it a lengthy mountain test yet.
Next week and we'll see.
