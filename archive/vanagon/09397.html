Sob!

	As you recall, last night I got the tranny in, and just had to install
brakes, etc and then the motor.

	So tonight I put fluid in, and sure enough, it started leaking in 
the exact same spot (from under the 6 bolt side plate)

	I called the tech references I had available, and I seems that I must
not have the axle in right, or there is still a larger problem I can't
see.

	Also, the wheel will NOT turn independently from each other, which 
hints at a more sinister problem.

	So i put the brakes and wheels on and pushed it back out of the garage,
in bitter defeat.  I'll be back though!

	Tomorrow I have the day off, the day I was s'posed to be going to
Pfiefer, but no such luck.  So I'm going to make a few calls for
tech support and a parts run for yet another set of gaskets! Oye!

	I'll have to split the reduction boxes again, and take everythign
apart all the way back up to the tranny. :(

	Do any of you swingaxle people, bug or bus, know anything about the
nylon spaces that go inside the tranny, under the axle tube?  I don't have
any on this tranny, and my split case didn't, but the last one I took apart
did have them, and I was told, by the only guy who seems to know what
he's talking about, that I need to have them.  Since nobody seems to 
know what they are, I can't find them anywhere!

Thom
