  Thanks for your thoughts on the sound system installation.  I just 
thought you might be interested to learn that one of the top of the line 
Boston Acoustics little systems that includes a crosover, a 5 1/2 inch 
driver, and a high frequency unit for each side has been selected by one 
of the car audio magazines reviewers two years in a row as the best 
sounding basic system he's ever heard.  I don't recall the price, but it 
was several hundred dollars for this little set.  
  Yes, I have full range Acoustate monitor 4's as my home system, and car 
equipment can't compare to a set of full range electrostatics.  But I've 
heard some nice vehicle sound systems.
  John
