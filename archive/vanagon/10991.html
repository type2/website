Subject: Getting a vehicle into California - How hard?

There is a possibility I will be moving to the magical land of earthquakes,
mudslides, floods and droughts.

How hard is it to bring a vehicle from Canada into California and how much
does it cost?  Does all the original emissions equipment have to be present
and functioning, or do I have to pass a smog check?
