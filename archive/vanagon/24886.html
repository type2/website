Subject: Jalousie BUS window tip

Great way to make 'em look spiffy in a jiffy:
Brillo, SOS pad or such. Pinch it between your fingers, so as not to touch
the paint. OPen your windows, and scrub in direction of metal grain. Do
this until the pad slides smoothly. You won't beee-leeeve the difference.
(If you're really into it, top off with silver/aluminum polish.) About 10
minutes, and they'll look like new.
