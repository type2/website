&gt;Mark,
&gt;
&gt;I bought a bottle of Rain X anti-fog treatment and it seems to work ok.
&gt;I've used the Rain X that goes on the outside of the windshield, and
&gt;noticed that it needs reapplication about once a week to remain
&gt;effective.

Rain-X works great, and can even replace wipers in an emergency. But, in my
experience, it makes the wiper blades jump and skip if it is more than a
wek old. I had to use denatured alchohol to remove it from the wind screen.
It caused enough 'stiction' on my window to strip one of the wiper arms!
Once I cleaned the window, the blades run quite smoothly. My suggestion is
to keep your  wiper blades in good condition and save the rain-x for when
the motor burns out.
Ken
