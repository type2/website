Subject: Re: died, barely runs

rick&gt; I opened it up, checked things out - distributor was tight, no
rick&gt; obvious fuel leaks, no obvious loose wires. Got in and cranked it
rick&gt; some more, it was &quot;trying&quot; to catch but just wouldn't. Almost
rick&gt; sounded like it was mistimed. Finally it did, but I had to keep
rick&gt; the engine revs up around 2K rpm to keep it running. And when I
rick&gt; used my hand to hold the gas pedal steady, the engine was revving
rick&gt; up and down by itself. When I let it go, it would die again.
rick&gt;
rick&gt; This engine was just put back in a couple of weeks ago, but I
rick&gt; took it for a couple of road trips soon after to see how it
rick&gt; behaved - fine then. Has a new coil, points &amp; plugs too.
rick&gt;
rick&gt; The fact that it would run at all makes me think the spark is
rick&gt; okay. I'm thinking that something is in the fuel line or somehow
rick&gt; the FI is screwed up. Particularly mystifing is why it would be
rick&gt; revving up and down (just a couple of hundred RPM) by itself.

        Uhh, not to belabor the obvious, but have you checked vacum leaks?
I hate it when I overlook somthing obvious and tear everything apart, and I
do it too often for my taste. Good luck.

Peace,
