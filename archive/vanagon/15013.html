Try &quot;Zap a Gap&quot; (or just ZAP) which is a cyanoacrylic glue designed for model 
airplane applications.  Try to get it a a good hooby shop.I knew a guy once who
 zapped his engines into the  models rather than using bolts.  Use very little 
and do not get any on your  hands or you will glue them to the work.

&gt; those front grills are brittle, eh? I've broken off a bit of mine while
&gt; trying to pusht the van out of a muddy spot. I managed to glue it back on
&gt; with polystyrene cement (what memories that stuff recalls!) which worked
&gt; for about 8 months. I don't think toluene is the best solvent for whatever
&gt; plastic the grill is made of. Ive just re-glued it with fly tying head
&gt; cement (Loon brand). At the wreckers, you never seem to find a complete
&gt; grill, but I am toying with the idea of cutting up a broken grill for
&gt; replacement bits for my grill, which if left unhelped, will probably end
&gt; up looking like a photo from the Big Book of British smiles.
