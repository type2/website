Subject:      Re: din (whoops! VIN) numbers


&gt;i saw once upon a time a list of din numbers
mike do you want DIN's or VIN's????

DIN = Deutsche(sp?) Industrial Norm (a number that is assigned to say an
item is up to German Spec's- thay have these DIN numbers on just about
everything in Germany, even crapper paper!!!!)

VIN = Vehicle Identification Number, (vehicle serial number)


silly me, i'm a skier at heart and
din (ed)
when i shoud have
vin (ed)
sorry for the confusion

p.s. i've received the vin description

    thank you for your help.
