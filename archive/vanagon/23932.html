Subject: Re: Ohio Junkyard near Marietta on I77?

&gt;Does anyone know the name and phone number of this yard, or any
&gt;other yard in Ohio that specializes in VW's? I've been told about
&gt;this place by several friends that have driven past it. It's north
&gt;(?) of Marietta Ohio off I77. You can see it from the freeway.
&gt;There aren't any VW's left in the yards in NE Ohio. We live on top
&gt;of 2 salt mines here, so it is used in large amounts on the roads
&gt;here. Most old cars die of cancer, the bodies rot off of the
&gt;frames before the engines die in many cases. So, the old VW's
&gt;dissapeared from junkyards a long time ago.
&gt; 
&gt;Thanks,
 
Lisa

Lisa, I'm not sure of the junkyard's location that you are speaking of,
But there is one that I know of thats loaded with bay windows and
vangons on the Pa. line south of Youngstown.
Here's the info:
Feezel's auto wrecking, 412-336-5755 

Happy hunting!
R.J.
