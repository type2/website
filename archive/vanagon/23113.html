Sounds like the 1st Annual Bob Hoover West Coast and Down Relay Caravan.  
If I was anywhere close, *I'd* give Bob a ride!  How 'bout it you 
Westies?  It's payback time.

&gt; Sorry to bother you with this but I've got a little problem.  A
&gt; personal kind of thing.

&gt; I've got personal business in the Seattle area.  It involves a dead
&gt; shipmate.  I can't afford to make the trip right now but it's the
&gt; kind of thing a man has to do whether he can afford it or not.  So
&gt; I've been working on that and came up with a way to get TO Seattle. 
&gt; But I'm plumb out of ideas on how to get home.
