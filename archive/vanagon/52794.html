They
&gt;just eat and have sex, and eat and have sex, and then they wonder over to
&gt;the highway

Hey! Now just wait a minute!! What a great life! Anyone know how one becomes
a deer?  Is it a club or something?  Do they have a secret handshake? Do
they wander over the highway to have sex?  or to look at vanagons? I just
want to be deer...
