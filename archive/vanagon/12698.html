So William R. Kennedy, NJIT CIAT, 201-596-5648&quot;_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu says:
&gt; S. Johnson asks about gas auxiliary heaters, of which I have one in my
&gt; Vanagon.  I've seen several air-cooled Vgons with this option, so it was
&gt; certainly available, maybe even widely available, in the U.S.  The only
&gt; caution in the owner's manual about it is not to run it so much you run
&gt; down the battery, so I would think it is campable.  It has a timer on
&gt; it just like gas heaters in Things, etc.  Should not be TOO big a chore
&gt; to retrofit: it takes the place of 3 or 4 feet of ducting and has its own
&gt; little fuel pump etc.
&gt; B.
&gt; 

Okay, I've gotten a couple of answers that so far seem to pertain to
an air-cooled setup.  I drive a water-cooled vanagon.  Does the same
still apply as far as adaptibility is concerned?
