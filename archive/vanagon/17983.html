I would like to propose and volunteer to host a Meet at an RV site close
to New York City (near the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island). 
Anyone interested pls email me with preferred dates. I will post
the results of the polls if there is strong interest.
Since the objective of this meet is a self-help gathering I will
also try to get VW experts available to assist in problems relating
to your vehicles especially type 2's and Vanagons.
If you are among those who has been take for a ride by vw and
their dealerships in getting your vanagon or other vw fixed, you should
consider this gathering seriously.
 If we can get together and have a good time the effort would have
been worhtwhile !
