&gt; Subject:       brake booster diagnostics
&gt; 
&gt; I'd posted this earlier but it seems pertinent again...
&gt; 
&gt; Vacuum-assist problems can be diagnosed by following a logical
&gt; sequence of steps.  The first step is to make sure that the unit is
&gt; receving the proper vacuum.  A restricted and/or cracked hose would
&gt; result in little or no assist and after repeated brake applications,
&gt; the pedal would become more diffficult to depress. Another test is to
&gt; check for vacuum leaks on the power booster itself and for faulty
&gt; operation of the check valve.  With the engine turned off, listen for
&gt; a vacuum leak.  If no vacuum leaks are heard, wait two or three
&gt; minutes, then depress the brake pedal to see if vacuum is still
&gt; present in the reserve system.  A leak is present if there is no
&gt; assist on the first brake application.  The leak will be through
&gt; either the check valve or an external leak.  To test for a
&gt; malfunction of the check valve, close the vacuum hose off after the
&gt; egine has idled to make sure full vacuum is in the system.  The
&gt; above steps are then repeated.  If vacuum is held in the unit with
&gt; the hose closed off, the check valve is faulty.
&gt; 
&gt; A check for assist can be made by first depressing the pedal several
&gt; times with the engine off to make that no vacuum is in the system.
&gt; The brake pedal is then held down and the engine is started. This
&gt; should cause the pedal to 'give' and move down slightly.
&gt; 
&gt; If the unit does not leak during the reserve check it is possible the
&gt; problem then exists inside the booster unit.  With the brake pedal
&gt; depressed and the engine running, listen for a hissing sound caused
&gt; by vacuum leakage.  If it cannot be heard, stop the engine and
&gt; continue listening.  A steady hissing sound with the pedal depressed
&gt; that goes away with the pedal released indicates a diaphragm or
&gt; poppet valve (a thingy inside the booster) malfunction. replacement
&gt; of the booster is required to correct this problem.
