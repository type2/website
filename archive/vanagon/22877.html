Subject:       New A/C refrigerant

Hello All.  I was reading the Aug/Sept 1995 World of Wheels magazine 
today, and it had this interesting article about a new refrigerant 
that is ozone friendly that works in old R12 type systems.  I thought 
I would post this to the list.  The article, in part;

.....All air conditioners on new cars launched in the past couple of 
years have used R-134a, a refrigerant that cannot damage the earth's 
protective ozone layer.  However R-134a is not compatible with most 
older a/c units designed to run on the previous bad-for-the-ozone 
R-12 refrigerant.  Converting to R-134a often means replacing the 
entire system as well.

Meanwhile, production of R-12 will soon be banned altogether.  Any 
remaining quantities that have been stockpiled will likely leap in 
price.

The new refrigerant, FRIGC (pronounced &quot;frigick&quot;) FR-12, is claimed 
to be virtually as environmentally benign as R-134a, but can be used 
in existing R-12 based systems with only some minor changes to 
service fittings.

FR-12 has been approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency.  
It is being marketed initially to fleet operators but will in due 
course be available to individual motorists.

For more information call 1-800-555-1IGC   (that's.. one eye G C)

Things look promising...

Harry.
