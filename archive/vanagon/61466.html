Subject: Syncro Bilsteins Survey

 BatSubject:     Syncro Bilsteins Survey                6/16/97    6:08 PM
OK, the front of my Syncro is now sufficiently apart to measure the shocks. 
So I did that.  I am now interested in finding out how many of us are
interested in Bilsteins for the front of our Syncro's.

I spoke with Bilstein East coast about this, and sent him the pertinent
dimensions.  Worst case, I am hoping he can come up with an appropriately
sized/valved shock for the Syncro.  It would then be up to some enterprizing
person (maybe me, or some interested shop???) to purchase shocks and cut the
body in the appropriate place to mount a standard Bilstein Spring Plate.  Best
case, the rep. will come up with a real Bilstein shock that is available in
Europe, or SouthAfrica, or Canada, or wherever.....????

SO, PLEASE RESPOND to me directly, and I will repost to the list the interest
level, and repost status as this little adventure of mine continues.  Let me
know if you are interested in a Bilstein front shock for your Syncro Vanagon.
