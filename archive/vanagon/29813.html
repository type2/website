Would anyone know whether transmissions can be inspected for wear? I'm
talking about tests that would be akin to checking compression on an
engine, for example, and that can be performed in, say, less than an hour,
without taking everything apart. 

If the only way is a test-drive, what experiments would you suggest?

Curiously Yours,
