I'm back and I WAS kind to old people.  Made 2500 km on the trip and saw
only two Vanagon Westys at the Roadster Party.  These beasts are rare ! 
Around here , Ottawa, I see them all the time !!  I tried to find a hubcap
for my missing one and no luck.  I stopped at a few of those roadside
hubcab flogers and they just looked at me as if I were from outer space. 
&quot;Never saw one of those things around these parts&quot;  Then I called 20 or 30
scrap yards around the Pittsburgh area and came up with nothing.  Only two
yards had a Vanagon , one was already stripped of all the goodies and the
other had just been sold in whole.    Oh well !!   Then I tried to find
some off thos $60 Michlen tires that some of you folks were raving about
at Sears or Tire America.  Ha ! big joke that is.  Mosts places did not
even know what I was talking about.  I finally found one Tire America
place near Pittspurgh that had two of them and would &quot;TRY' to get two more
but he wanted $115. each plus taxes installation and transport for the two
he would order in.  Well, that turn into about $175. each my Canadian
money.  Thanks but no thanks.  I found no one else, anywhere with any
reinforced sidewall tires in stock,  they all said they would have to
order them, a week or so plus UPS charges.  Thanks  but no thanks
again.
I guess I will look for some tires around Ottawa.  As for the Hubcap I
have a nice one from a Thunderbird on there now,  I picked it up along the
road , on the I-80 where it meets the I-81, there are some god awful
rumble strips there and my buddy in front of me with his VW fox lost one
of his caps so we stopped to pick it up and found the ditch filled with
hubcaps of all descriptions.  NO VW Vanagon ones though.  I picked up
three good ones though and they all fit but I like th Thunderbird one the
most.  So those of you looking for hubcaps, check the ditches by the
rumble strips.    So,,besides all the hubcap and tire woes all else went
well and the Westy ran well.  Sure showed it's VW heritige when we got to
the mountains of Pennsylvania,  third gear had a good work out!  We
wouldn't want a VW van climbing a hill in fourth gear now would we !!
Only a V-8 conversion  will do !

Well enough BS I gotta go back to work.

Cheers,

Frank
