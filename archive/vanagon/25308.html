Subject: Re: PC300 inverter



remember, when the PC 600 is putting out 5 amps, then (110*5 =
550Watts) it is drawing MORE THAN 45 amps from the
alternator/battery.

Scares me to think that the PC 1500, at full blast, could draw more
than (1500/12 = 125) 125 amps from the alternator/battery combo.  

Better get an extra laternator while you're at it!!!!!

 &gt; I have the PC 600 inverter.  It cuts out right at a 5 amp load.  I
 &gt; wouldn't bet on the PC300 doing more than 300 watts.  It's not a bad
 &gt; inverter for the price, but I would only count on the continuous rating
 &gt; at best.  Kinda wish I'd splurged for the 1500 watt model.
