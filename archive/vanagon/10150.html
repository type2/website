&gt;My fuel consumption was 38.5mpg, with about 50 miles of city 
&gt;driving included.  (can't wait to read the replies to *that*!)
&gt;
P.J.,

would that g in mpg be Imperial or US...?   ;^)

Joachim
'90 GL (gas/essence/Benzin/petrol and definitely not 38.5mpg, Imperial
        or US or otherwise)
