&gt;&gt;I believe they sell direct (615-833-4101). Anyone else ever try this stuff?

Kroil? Great stuff!

Before I got into computers, i used to work as a boat mechanic in the Chesapeake Bay (MD) area. Needless to 
say, the salt water wreaked havoc on the running gear..corrosion in a big way! Kroil and the &quot;blue wrench&quot; 
(also known as the acetelyne torch) were the only way to get things apart in one piece! 

Since many of the bolts that boat engine manufacturers using were made of stainless steel, we would go to great 
lengths to avoid breaking them off. Only thing worse that drilling out hardened stainless bolts are broken off 
taps or extractors!

Kroil was the preferred penetrating oil. I used to heat the offending part, then apply Kroil while still hot. 
Some of it would vaporize and burn off, but some would cool the part and seep in during the cooling 
(contracting) process. Repeat as nesc!

Kroil is cheapest non-areosol, by the gallon. I think it was about $26 last I bought some. Now that I work on 
cars and boats as a hobby, not a professional...that gallon should last me 10 years or so!

Down side of buying the stuff is that you are on a mailing list from hell. Not a month goes buy without a 
direct mail ad for Kroil in your mailbox...

Once again, excellent stuff! Rates right up there with Heli-Coils (another boat mechanic favorite)!
