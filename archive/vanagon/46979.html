Subject: Re: Westfalia Dometic fridge and sink bowl trouble

&gt;I've owned my 81 VW Westfalia for 11 years and have taken it from Yukon
&gt;Territory to Matzatlan Mex.  For the first time my propane mode fridge won't
&gt;remain operational during the night and the sink drain plastic housing to
&gt;hose has broken making it kaput for use.  Any advise on repair of both would
&gt;be appreciated.  Found a RV center who will for $150 service Dometic fridge.
&gt; thanks

The fridge's flue, burner and jet probably need cleaning.  Here's my story:

Over the years, the fridge in my '86 Westfalia became harder and harder to 
light and keep lit.  I would have to open the drain plug and attach a little 
hose and bicycle tire pump to light it.  Last year the drain tube got 
clogged with what looked like reddish brown sand; dirt, rust and ash.  I 
Took it to one of the &quot;Camping World&quot; chain stores (a Dometic dealer) but 
they were overbooked and couldn't get to it the day of my appointment which 
meant spending an extra night in a motel!  I asked the Service Manager if 
there was a high altitude kit for the burner (I live in Colorado); he 
checked around and told me there was no such kit available.  I got him to 
admit that the mechanics don't like to work on fridges in VW's, everything 
is small compared to what they're used to and there's very little room to 
work in.   The mechanic broke a corner off of the cabinet trying to get the 
fridge out but it he repaired it acceptably.  If you still have the fridge 
owner's manual, you might want to make it available to the service dept. 
just in case they need it for the service info that's in it.  The mechanic 
told me that the pressure regulator has to be set just right or the fridge 
won't operate properly.  The total bill was $105, all labor, no parts. 
Apparently it was pretty dirty in there as now the fridge starts right up 
with one click of the Piezo knob.
