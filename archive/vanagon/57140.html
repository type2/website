Subject: '81 Westy Deep-cycle/group 41 combo Q's

Hello.
I have equipped my '81 Westy with an Eveready Premium marine deep-cycle
and starting battery (850 MCA, 120 Amp Hours) oohaah! I have it hooked
up to the (pathetically inadequate) 65 amp alternator by way of a dual
battery isolator.  I can now monitor the charge of *both* batteries with
the LEDs on the stove panel, because I replaced the SPST micro-mini
switch with an SPDT with a center 'off' position. (BTW nobody seems to
supply these anymore, so you have to modify an SPDT to have an 'off',
e-mail me if you want to know how)   
 I've noticed that while driving, the main battery (the group 41, which
is brand new) is not charging fully. It's LED remains on yellow most of
the time. I suspect that the 'el cheapo' isolator has too high a
resistance for the (pathetically inadequate) 65 amp alternator to
overcome sufficiently in order to charge both batteries. Believing this
to be true, I rushed out and purchased one of those fat relays that
links both batteries together only after you turn on the ignition.    

 Okay here are the questions...[drumroll]

 I am concerned that the real problem is that the two batteries are too
different in their respective resistance's to charge equally. So the
greedy deep-cycle battery is hogging all the charge and not leaving any
for poor Mr. Group 41! 
 #1-Is this a factor in my dilemma? 
 #2-Do they sell and isolator that provides an appropriate charge to
each battery depending in what type it is, eg. deep-cycle/group 41?
(sorta like those master cylinders made for cars with front disc and
rear drum?) 

 I also figured that in order to prevent the deep-cycle battery from
sharing in the burden of cranking over the engine, I would find a place
to connect the relay that only becomes 'hot' after the engine is
running. I believe that the wipers go off and possibly the headlights
too, I'll have to check. 
 #3-Does any one want to save me the time of searching and tell me the
approximate location the relay that does that neat trick of temporarily
shutting off the wipers and lights? I noticed a 'load reduction relay'
in the WISE AND POWERFULL BENTLY MANUAL's wiring diagrams, is that the
one that I seek?? Please don't make me look at those wiring diagrams
anymore, they make my head hurt!! ;)

 Is there anything that I'm overloo...no, let me rephrase that...what am
I overlooking?

 Oh, and yes, I am aware of the kit that boosts the output of the stock
alternator by leaps and bounds, but I don't wish to spend the $125 to
get one. Well, not unless I have too...

Thanks in advance, during, and after.
