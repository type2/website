Subject: two questions ...

A few questions;

1. I recently broke the head off of one of the bolts while removing my
73 Camper's bumper. Any suggestions about what I should do now?
2. Also, I have a Webber progressive, but lack the appropriate VW linkage
to hook up the accel. cable. Does anyone know where I can buy one?

 Thanks a bunch,
Dan
