Subject: CV Circlip removal tool!??!

Hey hey,
   I have removed my driveshafts and CV joints in order to repack the CVs 
and replace the boots.  The circlips are a problem.

I rented a CV clamp tool from my FLAPS, but all I have managed to do is 
Mangle one of the circlips.  Exactly how should i go about removing these 
durned things?   Am I using the wrong tool?  I will be next going to the 
archives in search of old advice.  Wish me luck.  If there is a trick to 
thiss, I'd love to get a clue.... would I ever!

TIA
-Greg
