&gt;switches Monday to replace. Any idea what the life of a master cylinder is -

I replaced the m.c. on my '73 Westy last week.
After checking all the service records I found that the alternator and 
master cyl. have never been replaced in the 217,000 miles the car has driven. 
I'd better call Ripley's.  ;-)                  YMMV

And now for something completely different...
Maximum speed on flat ground? 95mph on I-10 East in Calif.
It's International Orange; the same color they paint utility vehicles
and garbage dumpsters.
