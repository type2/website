     &gt;      Greetings Vdubbers - can anyone help with a frustrating 
     problem?
     &gt;      It goes like this - my '78 van has the window winder mechanism 
     missing &gt;      from the driver's side door so I go and purchase the 
     mechanism which 
     &gt;      is indeed an ingenious device.
     
     Please, where did you get the new mechanism?  I need to replace one in 
     my van, and it gets damn hot in NC not being able to roll down the 
     driver's side window.
     
     Gary,
     I bought this part from a branch of a Volkswagen spares dealer called 
     Volkspares who have quite a number of shops all around the UK. Their 
     main stores and Head Office (where I bought this part) are at the 
     following address:
     
     Volkspares Ltd
     104 Newlands Park,
     Sydenham,
     London,
     SE26 5NA
     
     Tel: 0181 778 7766/0710
     Fax: 0181 676 9619
     
     Thanks for your reply. It looks like a tricky job to remove the 
     channel. If you attempt this tell me how it goes
     
     Cheers.
     Sun is shining and its Friday YAAAAH!
