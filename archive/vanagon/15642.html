Subject: List Moderation On

In order to stem the tide of posts designed to imflame and malign others, 
I've turned on moderation for the list.

 (I can't _believe_ I'm doing this!)

I started this list to discuss Vanagons and felt that VW buses were also
an acceptable topic.  I don't feel that long discussions of comparisons of
different brands of cars fall into that topic area. Some discussion of
that ilk makes sense, but not the posts which seem to be deliberately
designed to make people angry about what kind of car they have. 

I originally shut the list down entirely, but was informed by my wife 
that that really wasn't very fair to the people who really did enjoy the 
on topic discussion and had had the courtesy to not join in the &quot;my car 
is better than yours&quot; and the &quot;you're an idiot for working on your car in 
the street&quot; frays, so this is my compromise.

This has been an awesome group of people to have reasonable discussions 
with, and I sincerely hope that we can continue to exist without 
resorting to name calling.  I'm not going to run a list in which people 
do that on a regular basis.  It doesn't matter if you agree or not, just 
don't be rude to each other on a mailing list.

Thanks, and for those of you who are not happy about this decision, I'm 
sorry.
