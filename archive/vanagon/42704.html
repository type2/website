Subject: 	Re: awnings, what I've learned

When I started to investigate installation I
saw that the diagonal arm that holds the awning up when pulled out would
interfere with the front door(you can't open the door with the awning out).
It seems that all of the awnings that I see only go to the rear of the 
front
door. I have been very busy lately and haven't really studied this
instalation completely, so it might be possible to install a 10 footer but 
I
think it will be a problem.
