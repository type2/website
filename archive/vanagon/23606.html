&gt;My mechanic showed me a catalog from a company called Kennedy Engineered
&gt;Products, they offer a engine-transmission &quot;peice&quot; (i cant think of the
&gt;proper word now) it adapts a Chevy V-6 to a vanagon transmission.  the
&gt;company has ads in hot vw's, i am very curious as to everything about this
&gt;swap, would more cooling be needed? would everything fit? fuel injected or
&gt;carburated?  i plan to do this after my engine dies.

I'm very interested in hearing more about this solution.  I'd really
appreciate any direct knowledge the list has to share on the V6 swap and
Kennedy Engineered Products.
