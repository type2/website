Oh boy, I'm having a rough morning for some reason....As Chris points out...

I'm not Josh, ( you posted this to everybody) but what do you mean by
&quot;auxilliary passenger heaters&quot;  -  a gas heater?   or a rear H2O heater 
core?
'81's and '84's aren't the same.

Hi Ron

Yes, I know I posted my reply to everyone.  With the volume of chatter 
distributed on this list, I'm comfortable posing questions to the list (even 
when part of the response is directed at a specific person).  Also, I do 
know (or believe) that my '84 is the first year of the wasserboxer, so it 
was a fairly stupid question to ask if the passenger compartment heater 
(under the 3rd seat) exits in the air-cooled vanagons too.

Wishfull thinking got the best of me.

Is it Friday yet?
