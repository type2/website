&gt;Will 215/70 14's fit ok on a Bus?  My '72 to be exact?  Would there be 
&gt;any wheel well clearances?  Or is 205/70 about as big as you can go?  
&gt;Would like to try some 215/70s from Goodyear (The Workhorse label) but 
&gt;would hate to have problems due to size.  
&gt;

The 215/70-14 will work fine.  The extra size will compensate for the reduced
load range of the standard tire.  Even though this is a truck labeled tire,
it is actually rated as a pasenger car tire, load range B.  Truck rated tires
have the size marked with an LT. Pasenger cars are marked with the P.  When
using the P standard tires, they must be de-rated 10% when used on a light
truck.  Considereing all this, a good set of high performance tires will
probably give a better ride and handling over the &quot;Work horses&quot;.  Pirelli
makes a tire called the APT400 in this size.  It is called a light truck
touring tire.  May be worth checking out.  Goodyear aquatreads work well
also.  Yokohama A378 is available in this size and only costs about $60.  H
speed rating also.  Hope some of this helps.
Dennis.
