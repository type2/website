Yesterday I wrote about my Vanagon tranny, dealer said it sounded like the
 carrier bearings were bad.  I mistakenly wrote that the sound occurs when I 
lift
off the gas pedal.  Actually, it's when I depress the gas pedal, not when 
the
van is coasting.  I notice it most when I keep the van at a constant speed: 
it's
a grinding sound, not a smooth engine-only sound.  (Can you tell I'm not a
gear head?)

Tim Smith and Gerry Skerbitz both offered good advice (try to isolate the 
noise,
or consider a rebuilt tranny for half the price quoted by the dealer).  Any 
other
thoughts about tranny noise from a 4-speed vanagon?

Thanks in advance.
