Subject: Camping in Prince Edward Island this Summer

Howdy,

I have been on the Vanagon list for about a year now and have noticed quite a
few list members are from Canada or traveled in Canada. So maybe someone out
there could help me.

 I have always wanted to go to Canada. So, I am think of taking the family to
Prince Edward Island in August and camping for a week.  My family consist of
2 Adults and 2 teenage children and a dog,  we are not the most rugged group,
we just need to get away from the TV, telephones and running around. Do a
little fishing and sightseeing. Last year we stayed at a place in Maine that
had sites with a shelter with a small outdoor kitchen area and an enclosed
bath/shower area.  This made our stay very enjoyable.


Does anyone have any recommendations?

Thank you in advance
