Subject:      FENDER LIPS read again...

ok..
soooooo.......
after all this hashing and re-hashing......   (and re-re-hashing.. and
getting a kazillion different vague answers..)

-WHAT is the &gt;&gt;FINAL&lt;&lt; price for US listmembers that are ordering the fender
&quot;lips&quot;?? (not mebbe we should send 40 or 50 extra bucks &quot;juss in case&quot;...most
of us cannot afford that..I'll be doin good to get the initial money
together..)

-WHEN is the DEADLINE to have the money to Martha Rubin??

-HOW do they attach? (screws? glue?)

-WILL THEY come into contact w/ the fiberglass rocker trim of the late
Vanagons...(NO... I CAN'T tell this by looking at a picture of 4 fender lips
sitting on the floor or whatever)

the answers to the aforementioned questions would be GREATLY appreciated
before any money is sent..
