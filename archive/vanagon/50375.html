&gt; the winder to take up the extra slack.  After spending a couple of hours
&gt; and numerous finger punctures trying to untangle the cable, 

I have never seen Vanagon power windows, but have had excellent luck
replacing the cable on the FWD cars power systems by careful dissasembly
and replacement with new cable from hardware store when necessary.
Rebuilt both rear '90 Passat winders and one front winder on the
'86 Quantum Syncro.

Merely FWIW
