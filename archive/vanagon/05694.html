    The heat issue is quite simple (I didn't think of it though).  All he is
going to do is weld up a &quot;Y&quot; to bring the output from the two Porsche Heater
boxes together.  Then run a PVC (or something else) insulated pipe up the
center to tap into the blower up front.  TADA ... he has heat...instant heat
at that.
