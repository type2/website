sorry if i offended anyone with opinions on what I consider to be sacred
vehicles.  Whoever possesses the title to the vehicle can certainly do
whatever he/she pleases.  I was not trying to be politically corrsect,
merely expresseing an opinion.  If I am to be kicked off the list for
expressing opinions, then so be it.  I am definately not trying to offend
anyone.  And just which God are we talking about anyway??
