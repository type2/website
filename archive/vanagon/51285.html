Subject: Engine, Trany, &amp; Interior Sources for Westy's

Item Subject: Text_1
     I am about to purchase my first VW -- a '85 Westy.  However, it needs 
     some work.  I have searched the net to find sources for good quality 
     parts.  However, I have not found any useful information.  Can anyone 
     point this newbie in the right direction.  Thanks in advance.
     
     Vince.
