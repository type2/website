Subject: Re: Window tinting

Tim H. responded with:

&gt;I had 80/20 tint installed on the rear windows and 65/35 installed on
the 
&gt;front door windows. This meets state law requiirements in Florida.
Check with

I likewise have 20% on the rear hatch window, 35% on the four rear
side windows (actually, it's six because they're sliding), and 50%
on the two front door windows.  Limo tint (5%) was a little too scary
for me, but the above tint grades that Tim and I chose give the van
a nice look.  More importantly, it really helps keep the interior
temps down in summer and saves the upholstery from UV.

There're at least two different types of tint, too, so be aware of 
what you're shopping for.  I think there's like regular smoke film,
and metallized (titanium?) that's supposed to reflect more heat.
If you have a shop do it, shop around and make sure you pick one
that knows what they're doing; it's not rocket science, but there
sure is a big difference between doing it right and doing it for
a price...  And don't forget, if you do get tinted windows, do NOT
clean the tint w/ an ammonia based cleaner (unless, of course, you
happen to like the look of purple windows on your van).
