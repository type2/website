Subject: WTB Used Brown '81 V-gon Seat Covers

Howdy all,

 I am looking for stock brown vinyl/cloth ar just plain vinyl-only front
seat covers to use in my current reupholstering project. 
 Essentially I am sewing (yes, a man that sews!) new brown cloth seat
covers to go over or replace my stock ones. The stock covers are that
strange multi-colored striped cloth that came on early brown interior
Westies. Even though they are well...um...let's just say *unique*, they
are still in nice shape but are showing signs of wear and I want to save
them. 
 
 All that I am looking for is the brown vinyl seat cover BACKS, so if
anyone is recovering their front seats or has replaced their seats due
to rips in the fronts or in order to upgrade to the newer armrest style
and might be interested in sending some my way for a reasonable fee then
let me know. 

Thanks,
 
Noel Leavitt
