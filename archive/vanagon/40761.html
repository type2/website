Subject: getting closer on the crew.

finally got a new wing window latch in the crew yesterday.  i ended up
haveing to refinish a NOS chrome one as black ones are not easy to find.
i put the glass back in the frame and reasembles the whole door.  looks
complete now.  it looks like all i have to do know is get my safari latch
base's (a continuing saga with the chrome shop) and detail it out and she
will be ready for the show this weekend.  maybe i can get a certain mag
interested in a photo shoot.  we will see.

Take care and God Bless

the chrome shop saga.  

i went down to pick up the bases that were suposed to be done 2 days
earlier.  well, they still were not done.  AARGGG!!!!  i am getting a
little tired of this.  what ever happened to things being done when they
say they will.  especially after claiming to have lost the parts for 2
weeks.  man......  Well anyway, they are the best shop around as far as
doing good work.  i guess i will have to keep waiting.

i also may have a line on a set of NOS left side safari latches.   that
would be a great find as the crew could use new ones.  we will see.
