Subject:       Re: throttle switch &amp; heater cable

&gt; According to them, it is running rich at start-up, due to a failing 
&gt; throttle switch.  This is causing premature wear of the distributor 
&gt; rotor, which is relativey new.  Does this sound reasonable?  If so, is it 
&gt; something I can live with &quot;for a while&quot;?
I'm no expert, but I fail to see how these two items are connected...
 
&gt; And, I complained about the low heat output, and they declared the heater 
&gt; temperature cable to be bent/kinked/whatever.  I am doubtful.  Has anyone 
&gt; experienced this problem?  The van passed their pressure test of the 
&gt; cooling system, no leaks, despite the sweetish odor from the rear heater.
I've heard of the mis-adjusted heater cable problem, so it is 
possible. However, the pressure test will NOT reveal a leaky rear 
heater core. Mine passed 3 tests before the dealer replaced the core 
and the control valve. Remove the plastic cover and look for white 
residue on the heater fins. I'd push this issue if they will cover 
the cost.
