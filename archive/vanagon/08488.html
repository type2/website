Yeah. That's right. Mention my name. It's Gerry Skerbitz, and I run the 
vanagon list.  Since I don't have enough money to join ANY of those 
clubs, that'd be nice if you mentioned my name since without me running 
this list, you wouldn't have a captive audience of 240 bus owners. Yikes. 

&gt; END OF CHEAP PLUG FOR VW CLUB
I think we needed to see some smileys on that one, right?

End of bitter selfish tirade &lt;smile&gt;
