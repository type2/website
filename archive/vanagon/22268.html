Subject: Re: sway bar or stabilizer?

Has anyone had any more luck than I've had in ordering the aftermarket
sway bars that WHellmer mentions?  JCWhitney includes the Vanagon on the
list for which they are supposedly available, but if you order says that
it's a catalog error (left unfixed lo' these many years.)  My hunger for
an aftermarket bar has lessened since I used P. Albrecht's trick of drilling
the broken loop/elbow piece for a bolt, but I'd still be interested in the
details on an aftermarket bar, especially one more rigid than stock.
