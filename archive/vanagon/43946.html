Subject: Seat Questions: 84 GL

Hi All,

I was 'cleaning house' in me 84 Vanagon GL &quot;Brownie Bus&quot; and I found the 
horizonal slider for the middle seat.  This does ease the removal of the 
middle two passenger seat and also allows for the revering of the middle 
seat.  Is there some advantage to this 180 degree move?  The back seat 
top pivots down nicely, but it doesn't turn into a bed.  Is this just the 
'standard' seating adjustments or am I missing out on something that 
allows for a 'weekender' type of bed?  The seats are rather contoured 
for the passengers, so it seems rather lumpy for stretching out.  Any 
insights into this are welcome.  Thanks.
