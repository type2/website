High Idle on 87 2.1 l Digifant
I did some more trouble shooting today.  I checked the throttle return =
spring, it works fine.  I checked the vacuum lines, When I disconnected =
the white or purple vacuum lines, the ones that come from the big =
canister in the passenger side rear wheel well, nothing happened.  Yes I =
mean absolutely NOTHING.  This would cause me to think that either the =
lines were cracked or there is a problem with this canister.  The lines =
were not cracked and the connections are good.  So what is this canister =
what does it do, and how can I check it?
