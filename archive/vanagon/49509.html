Subject: 90 leaking oil out of drain plug
Date: Mon, 16 Sep 1996 12:16:55 -0400 (EDT)

I took my van into get the oil changed two weeks ago and now the its 
leaking oil out of the drain plug.  Its the 2nd time I've had this 
same place do it (only had the van 4 months).  Before now it never 
leaked a drop.  I've been on the road for 2 weeks, so I couldn't 
really give it the attention it needs, except to top off the oil.  
I'm taking off an hour early to get this place to take a look at it, 
and to my knowledge, it could only be one of two things: an 
ineffective grommet, or a stripped drain plug.  If its a grommet, no 
problem, but if it is a stripped drain plug (which I suspect), is 
that a big deal?  I understand that there are self-tapping 
replacements for this, but is that a big deal?  big expense?  
potential problem?  I'm holding this quick lube place responsible for 
it no matter what, but I thought I should check with you guys first.
 
And before you get onto me...I know, I know, I should be doing it 
myself, but I supply the filter and for $12 its hardly worth me 
getting dirty and having to worry about recycling my oil (or perhaps 
it is).  

Thanks!
Ian
