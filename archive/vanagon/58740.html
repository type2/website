&lt;&lt;Whirrr, Whirrr&gt;&gt;

I had a similar problem with my 87 syncro GL. As it turned out, the
contacts in the starter solenoid were gummed up. I had the starter
replaced, but before they sent the core back I took a look and there was
quite a bit of gunk on the contacts - it was the original starter 112k.
My advice: pull starter, crack her open, clean her up, stick her back
in, don't worry be happy.


John
