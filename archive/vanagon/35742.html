Subject: list stickers and web pages

I got my list stickers in the mail today and they look great.  I even 
braved the driving rain outside to put them on.  After all the discussion 
we've had lately about sticker placement, I put them on the lower 
driver's side of the front and back windows.  Thanks Richard!

Also, I've got pictures of my bus up on my web page, incase anyone's 
interested.  Feel free to add my URL to any of your lists as well.  i'm 
trying to add eveyone's to mine.  Visit my vw page and if you're URL 
isn't there, send it to me and I'll add it.

Craig
