Subject: Engine transplants, radiators on bay-windows

	The other day, while parking to go into Berkeley Hardware,
I spotted a bay-window Westie with a radiator on the nose. Thinking
this unusual, I asked the driver and passenger, who were just walking
away, what kind of engine they had. 2.8 liter Ford the driver said.
Plenty of power, and very reliable. The radiator was in a channel-iron
square with heavy metal mesh as a grille, all bolted to the
bumper and nose sheet-metal. A fan about 9 inches in diameter
was mounted behind the radiator, with clear space behind it.
The fan was driven by a shaft which emerged from nose sheet metal.
Probably driven by an electric motor mounted inside.

	The radiator box was painted a nice industrial orange which
went well with the orangish paint on the rest of the bus.

	The radiator was a conventional looking taller-than-wide
job, with the cap doubtless the highest point (no cooling system bleed
issues that way...) I didn't see what kind of hoses it used.

	The Mexican-made Caravelles have the same kind of upright
radiator in a radiator box on the front. Next time I go down
to Tijuana, I should try to get a radiator box :)

	Bill
