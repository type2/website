Subject: Engine Governor Installation

Well this afternoon I bought a couple of studs and put the engine 
governor in.

I had to clearance abut 1/16&quot; of an inch off the acclerator pump pivot
arm, cause it hit the governor and restricted the throttle.

Other than that it was pretty straightforward.

You can run it without the cover on, and see how it works when you rev
the motor.  It doesn't seem to make much difference when you're just 
standing still revving it - it doesn't bog out or anything like a rev-limiter
will.

I set it all the way generous, and took it for a drive.  Not much of a 
difference, really.  I pulled over and set it to be more restrictive, ie
kick in earlier.  I actually set it all the way restrictive.  I went to
take off, and MAN what a difference!  The bus would barely move!  I cut 
the power down before I could even get it up to speed to shift!

I set it back real quick like and went on my way!

I'm goinf to experiment over the next couple of weeks to see how it 
actually performs on real life - like Hwy 5 and Hwy 80.  I know I've 
been getting the revs up on some of the downhills!
