It must be diesel week at the Munro household. 

After soliciting for help on the '86 Golf I'm picking up tomorrow, I figured
I was washed up on &quot;new&quot; VW's for a while.  Then last night my wife found an
ad in the local Nickel Ads for an '82 Vanagon Diesel that needed a clutch. $750

We went and checked it out today.  The body is straight, the interior is
perfect.  Starts and runs just fine.  It's currently owned by a pastor who
has lots of receipts, an extra injector pump, an extra head, and some VW
tools.  I asked lots of questions and he wasn't struck my lightening during
the conversation.  It was rebuilt by a very competent local shop 30,000
miles ago.  

While I need a diesel Vanagon like I need a size 11 boot up my butt, these
vehicles are the easiest of all to put a non-wasserboxer motor in.  I plan
on putting a gasoline Jetta/Rabbit motor in it.  I will keep anyone posted
who is curious on how it goes.

In the process of checking out alternate motors for our '79 Westy, I had
determined that the Rabbit/Jetta motor would be a great choice (after
wearing out two Rabbits, I'm convinced there is no engine with more zippy
miles per dollar than a Rabbit motor.  They are cheap, and plentiful.
