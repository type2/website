Subject: Rebuilt blocks from &quot;Fast German Auto&quot;

I'm hopefully far away from needing a rebuild, but does anyone have 
experience with &quot;Fast German Auto&quot; or the &quot;Vanagon Engine 
Connection&quot;?

They have an ad in &quot;hot VWs&quot; and a web page:

http://www.fastgermanauto_dot_com/

They advertise rebuilt longblocks for $1595 with a rebuildable motor 
trade plus $250 roundtrip shipping.
