Subject: Re: Carat Table Problems

If the table has the same lock as the one in my MV you have VERY slim
chance of forcing it open.  The latch is like a one-way clicker.  I.e. 
push and release to open, push and release to latch shut.  I had to keep
trying for two months to get my table loose.  I haven't let it latch back
since.  It looks like it may only need some lubrication to work correctly. 
But there is absolutely no backup method of releasing the table. 

Good luck,

&gt; I've never seen one of these tables before. It seems there is some sort
&gt; of catch behind the table low on the side. Is it a positive catch, or
&gt; some sort of jamming or spring mechanism: should he try to force it?
