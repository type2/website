Well, I've done it again.

Wrote an ode to the wonders of the Toyota 22R engine, and managed to get
nearly every important point wrong. It's NOT a DOHC engine, and doesn't
have a timing belt-- it has a chain instead, which lasts a lot longer
but is a lot tougher to change than a belt.

It's still a nice engine, though.

Henceforth I will confine my remarks to VWs and the various engines I've
dealt with personally, so that I can be wrong only about them. But that's
still a lot.   ;-)                                                ,
