&gt;I sure do hear differing stories on this.  Now I'd be more inclined to believe
&gt;someone that lives there rather than one that doesn't.  Do the rest of you that
&gt;live in the LA basin agree with Jim on this?

I lived there for 18 years, and it was always bad.  I can't honestly say it
is much better than it was in the late '70's, but that's as far back as I
can remember.  Of course, there are probably at least triple the number of
cars there now, so just the fact that it hasn't gotten worse is saying
something.  The LA basin is just &quot;designed&quot; to hold in smog.  I think there
would still be plenty of it even if nobody drove their cars for a week.
