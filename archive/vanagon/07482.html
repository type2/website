&gt; The editors also add that they had an article dealing with modifications to
&gt; the &quot;Wasservoxer&quot; engine for performance in the August 85 issue. 
&gt;
&gt; Anybody got this article or know what it says. It might be a good idea to
&gt; have it posted to the net.

I found that article in the Aug 85 issue last night but I forgot to bring
it in this morning.  So the following highlights are from memory.

It talks about an offroad race team using the wasserboxer engine because it
can produce more horsepower as comared to a similar aircooled engine.  
They use a Berg crank with type IV bearings, 100mm pistions with steel sleeves,
Engle camshaft with straight cut gears, Scat type IV solid lifters, and Engle
1.4 rocker arms.  The heads use stock valves, stock inner valve springs, and
Scat outer springs.  The case uses a windage tray, Melling oil pump, 
009 distributor, stock water pump, type I fuel pump and alternator.
Zenith carbs are used on a custom manifolds.  There was no mention of the
exhaust system.

There are lots of pictures which so much of the stuff being bolted on.
It looks like using type I and IV parts are interchangable on this engine.
The article has a name and address for more information.  There is also 
a picture of an another engine on a dyno with a supercharger on top of it.
The caption said it produces 385 horsepower _at_7800 rpm!

Since its been almost 10 years since this article was printed I am surprised
that no one has not produced any vanagon performance parts.  I guess there's
no market for it.  If anyone is interested in more info I might be able
to type it in or scan it at work.
