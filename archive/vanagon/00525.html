&gt; I have this same question.  I have about zero use for an air conditioner 
&gt; here.  Is there any possibility of running hot water through the air 
&gt; conditioning system?  Has anyone done something as crazy as this?  I 
&gt; guess I can't imagine just the dash vents keeping up with the cold when 
&gt; it gets below zero.
 
How about running an air conditioner but with the condenser in the cabin
(instead of outside) and the evaporator (which is normally inside) in the
engine compartment.  Essentially, you have a heat pump here.  Heat pumps work
great anywhere that the temperature (outside) is above 40-45 degrees.  What
you are doing - for those who don't understand an what a heat pump is - is
trying to cool down the outside (helps on global warming ;-) ) and trasferring
that heat inside.  Think of putting that home window A/C in the window
backwards.  A/Cs don't create cold - they just transfer heat from one place
to the other.  Reverse the direction of the transfer.  I would guess that a 
VW A/C unit would probably be rated at about 20KBTU (average for a midside
american car,  van is much bigger that that).  Run in reverse, you would get
about 20KBTU of heat in the car - about the same as a 4000 watt 
(333 amp _at_ 12 volts) electric resistance heater.  By putting the evaporator
in the engine compartment, you should have temperatures above 40 degrees even
in the dead of winter.
