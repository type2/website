I believe electric shock therapy is in order for your son!  ;-)

in the words of CSN&amp;Y....&quot;Beat your children well...&quot;..or was
it &quot;Teach your children well&quot;....

Perhaps it is some of your fault...all my boys were taught the
way of the Volkswagen (or brainwashed) from the cradle...if
this is your first 
VW, then you did not plan ahead...you should
have purchased one 14 years ago or so!!!  ;-)


Now if you got a WAY COOL GTI, then I bet it would be a different
story.

My deepest sympathies on your plight!

Ric
