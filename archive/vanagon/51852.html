&gt;&gt;The stupidity of that line of thinking should force all 'free thinking'
&gt;&gt;beings (or plainly - any being that thinks at all) to boycott Wal-Mart.

true. but the financial aspects of it all seem to be that Wal-Mart comes
into a smaller town and pretty much wipes out the local mom-and-pop stores
that had been there for years ... so much for American Values.

&gt;I think Erik was joking, but his jest was based on a real event.  WalMart
&gt;pulled sweatshirts from their shelves after deciding that the shirts were
&gt;detrimental to &quot;family values.&quot;
&gt;The design?  Margaret (from Dennis the Mennis) saying &quot;I believe one day a
&gt;woman will be president!&quot;

hmmmm. well, i can certainly see how that would be detrimental to family
values!! i mean, that's a poorly drawn comic strip (ever LOOK at the people?)
about a kid who has NOT had a proper upbringing, bothering everyone, getting
dirty every time he goes out of the house, has a FILTHY beast of a dog,
and simply has NO manners at all!!! i mean, REALLY!! ;) the neighbor, Mr.
Wilson, is the only one with any sense atall!

Beetle Bailey has MUCH more to offer in the way of socially redeeming values.
:)

&gt;The Right makes me sick.

yup. and the Wrong are even worse. reminds me of a Johnny Cash song from
years ago, about a Singing American Folk Group:
&quot;and the one on the right was on the Left, and the guy on the left was
in the Middle, and the guy in the back burned his driver's license.&quot;

or something like that. :)  maybe more like Kris Kristopherson's song
&quot;The Law is for Protection of the People&quot;. :)
(the idea here, folks, is that you should go hunt this songs and listen to
them).;)

(i burned my library card. does that count??) :)
