Subject: Re: engine removal 71 bus

i've seen busses with D head bolts through the starter,  and also 17mm heads.
 The Ds hang up on the starter.  But some starters are shaped differently,
and it doesn't hang up.    My first split (59)  had the 17mm and I'd start
the nut,  put a vice grip on the nut, then crawl under the bus, turn my arms
into elastic, and tighten it from under, with a long and a short extension on
the ratchet.

With the 71 you can tighten that bolt without climbing under.
