Subject: Re: '78 Bus heater Project (continued)

&gt; I considered this line of reasoning for my Rosie, but then it occurred to me
&gt; that the time when you need heat the most (dead of winter, 5:00 am, -10 deg. F)
&gt; is when the oil has the least to give. The complexities and impracticalities of
&gt; attempting to draw excess heat from the exhaust system led me to the
&gt; recirculating heating system. There has been extensive discussion of this in
&gt; previous threads, so I won't consume any more bandwidth.

Yep, I have been one of the strong proponents of the recirculation 
scheme,  frankly the oil radiator might be a much better idea, but you 
might have to use the interior unit as your only cooler in truely 
cold weather.  Even recirculation has not helped the '81 effectively 
during some of the ludicrous cold snaps we've had this winter, just 
too damn cold, even with 8&quot; of foam jammed into the pop-top hole and 
very solid heating system.
