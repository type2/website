Subject: New to list, need info on Syncro's

Hello Everyone,

I stumbled across this list about a month ago and would like to introduce   
myself because I am a Westy wantabee.  I live in Boulder, Colorado and   
spend many weekends in the mountains.  I am starting my research for a   
new, or like-new, car and have a strong hankering for a camper van (you   
know us guys, the hunt is more fun than the kill).  I've never own a   
Westy, or a Volkswagon for that matter.  I been trying to find out the   
history of the Westfalia via the web, but no luck.  Because I'm looking   
for a used model, I've been trying to find out the breakdown of different   
model types and what years they were made.

I am interested primarily in the 4WD version (Syncro?) because I spend a   
lot time off road and in the snow.  Can anyone tell me the following:

 - What was the last year the Syncro was made?
 - Are some models of the Syncro better than others?
 - I tend to put a lot of miles on my vehicles, about 250k.  If a Westy is   
maintained, what   kind of mileage can I expect?
 - Is the 4WD version worth it or will the 2WD go about anywhere (within   
limits)?
 - When did volkswagon switch to the EuroVan style?
 - I've looked at some of the new models and noticed that the engine is in   
front instead of    the rear.  When did they make that switch?
