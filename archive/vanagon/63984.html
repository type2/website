Hello all,

I found a large puddle of water on the driver's side floor mat of my '84
Westy this morning.  Having had heavy rain the night before, I checked all
the windows, they were all closed.  I did notice a small amount of water
collecting on the dash next to the lower left hand side of the windshield.
The water seems to have come from under the seal.  The Windshield seal is in
great shape, and there is no visible rust around the outside of the seal.  I
was wondering if there was a sealant I could use around the seal to keep
this from happening again.   I really don't want to replace the seal if I
don't have to.

Any Ideas??

Thanks
Mike D
