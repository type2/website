&gt;hi, its me again with the chirping van.  i investigated many of the
&gt;possibilities suggested by various listmembers, and everything on the
&gt;outside seems ok (spark plugs tight, no trash in fan, not
&gt;alternator/belt/muffler).  i ran a compression test, and the results were
&gt;(in order) 90, 104, 125,124.  the first two retested wet went up to 114
&gt;and 120.  so it's probably not the valves, right?  another thing i did is
&gt;remove plug wires (only one at a time) and rev the engine to try to
&gt;duplicate the chirp.  when i removed plug wire #2, the chirping almost
&gt;completely went away.  head gasket leak?  i didn't retorque the heads
&gt;(as was recommended last fall before storage) because i wanted to ask
&gt;for advice on this first.  is there anything further that can be done
&gt;without pulling the engine?
Maybe an intake or exhaust leak on #2?  Just trying to think of things that
wouldn't require a rebuild...
