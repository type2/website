Subject: Re: 5-/6-cyl in VW vans, bell housing numbers

John Wakefield asks:
&gt;
&gt;  Do you know if the factory 5 cylinder Audi powered Kombis are available 
&gt;with both 4 and 5 speed manual boxes?  Someone raised the issue of final 
&gt;drive ratios, suggesting that both have the same top gear ratio, rather 
&gt;than the 5th gear being higher.  This sounds wrong to me.  Does it seem 
&gt;possible to you that VW would have selected ratios like that?

I don't know, but I guess I can check. Joel should know... :-)

I rolled around under my father's van yesterday, with the result: The number
on the bellhousing he has (Audi 2.3 5 cyl to 4 speed box) is BCY 301103. But
the guys down at the local VW agents say BCY 301107A is the right part.
Special price, just for you :-) is R509, ex VAT, so say R580-ish, so about
$150 if I remember the exchange rate right. And shipping, of course. Not too
expensive for an experiment, if it doesn't fit the diesel you can still sell
it to someone who wants to use the petrol engine.

Helmut asked about the exhaust pipe. The (standard audi looking) manifold
feeds two downpipes, which then goes to the rear of the audi, or the front
of the kombi. Everything looks stock up to the point where these two pipes
feed into the Y. After that a single pipe runs to the front of the kombi and
does a U turn into a box hanging approx. under the sliding door. (Of course
the sliding door is on the left hand side of the vehicle) From the box the
return pipe runs parallel to the feed pipe, to a second box next to the
engine, and out via the cutout in the rear panel. Looks pretty easy to weld
up, and I would assume that the boxes are chosen for fit, i.e. eyeball the
space, select a box from the shelf.
