Subject: Highway paint

With all the speak around here of the correct paint code for
the white on wheels and bumpers, I have a question.

For a while I have been formulating the possibility of adding the
little glass spheres that are in highway paint to the paint
on my bumpers, and mabye even the wheels.

Does anybody have experience with this? Have you ever seen these
additives in body shops or paint stores? Mabye the sign-painting
business would be a good place to look....

Just a random though on increasing the nighttime visibility 
of a Bus with very small taillights without changing
the daylight look too much.....
