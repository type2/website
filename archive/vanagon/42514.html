Well, I've had these Wolfgang safaris a total of 2 days, and broke 2 latches
already.  I've closed them 3 times in the whole time I've had them.

Not very good averages, IMHO

I'm s'posed to be able to get new latches for free, but we'll see.
(BTW - I beleive these latches are different from the &quot;real&quot; safari 
window latches.)
