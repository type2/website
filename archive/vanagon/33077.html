Subject: new toy-- Fluke Mdl 78 Automotive DMM

Just had to share this with a few that care!

I picked up a bran' spankin' new DMM specifically tailored for 
automotive use.  it measures frequency, duty cycle, dwell, temp, in 
addition to the usual fare.  Fluke's top line automotive DMM is the 
88 but at a list price of $479, i'd have to do dishes a LONG time in 
our house.  this model 78 has fewer features but i paid $239.

i'm so excited, i can hardly wait for something to go wrong!
