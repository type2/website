&gt; It's funny how so mnay of these threads apply to one or another current 
&gt; projects of mine.  Maybe that's because I seem to be having to fix 
&gt; everything...
&gt; 
&gt; What's the best way to drive out the old starter bushing? Screwdriver and 
&gt; hammer?

I used an allenhead bolt.  You might be able to get it out with a bolt
thats the right diameter and about 8&quot; long.  Thread it in and then try
to pull it out.
