&gt; 	In the Pacific NW we are blessed with Les Schwab Tire Stores. And, I
&gt; 	mean that positively. I'm very impressed with there business policies
&gt; 	particularly when compared to dealers and other shops.
&gt; 
&gt; 	I take all brake-tire-shock work to them.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Honestly, a couple weeks prior to putting my '91 on the market, I took
&gt; 	it to Schwab's for brakes and align.. I figured with 45K miles, it'd
&gt; 	need brakes soon.
&gt; 
&gt; 	At work they called me and asked why I wanted brakes. I said 'well, uh,
&gt; 	well, at 45k......'
&gt; 
&gt; 	They said it was only 50% worn and keep my money. No charge.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Most businesses woulda just done the work for the business.

My experience with Les Schwab, albeit limited, hasn't been nearly so 
favorable.  I took my '91 Westy in to repair a persistent tire leak (a 
previously plugged puncture).  The idiot who did the work tried to put 
the wheel cover, which is VERY obviously made of plastic, back on with a 
mallet!  Gave it a big WHACK, knocking off about a 10&quot; chunk of the wheel 
cover rim.  Then he threw the mallet, came storming by me, and told me it 
was &quot;a piece of f**king sh*t&quot;.  He denied he'd used the mallet - though 
I'd been watching the entire thing, and he was fully aware of this, and 
then tried to scare me into buying a new tire, saying the plug that had 
been installed could have damaged the steel belts, causing the tire to 
de-laminate while driving!  Do I want this idiot psychopath doing my 
BRAKE WORK???  Sorry...  I think I'll save the time and money, and just go 
drive off a bridge.  (P.S. - their prices aren't that great either.  Here 
in Seattle, I'd recommend Discount Tire)
