&quot; I considered making the front tubes as well as the rears (even out of 
     stainless steel) but I thought that they were relatively easy to come 
     by so i didn't bother. I knew that the rears were mega rare and the 
     ten that I made all sold at Bug Freeze last year.

i think it is much harder to find a DECENT front tube than the back ones,
 even though it is easier to find front bumpers.
