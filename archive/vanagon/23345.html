Subject: Stafford says Wailaki is fine!


Jack Stafford called and left a message on my tape today.  Unfortunately
I missed him, but the jist of his message was that the Wailacki
campsite will suit our group just fine and to go for it. Here's
who's coming.  If they are in the first category, it's definite, if
in the second with a &quot;?&quot; preceeding the name, they are still up
in the air.

Now, Jack had some more details to add to the instructions beyond
those which I already posted a week or so ago.  I'm running around
like a chicken today, but will try to decipher them from off
the tape late tonight, and post them then or early tomorrow.

BRING FIREWOOD - they are a big fire ring.  Bradley:  I guess this
means you'll need your tranquilizers, huh?  :)
