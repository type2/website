&gt;BTW, there was a bus sitting up there, 68-71 I think. No wheels or engine,
&gt;but otherwise appeared complete. Probably still there. This is also near
&gt;where the B-29 Kee Bird sat for 50 years until recently, R.I.P.

I feel another PBS special coming on:

&quot;The Rescue of the V-Bird&quot;  (made possible by a grant from West Coast
Metric, and viewers like you)

Opening shot, a panoramic view of the icy mountains of Greenland, slowly
zooming in on a lonely VW bus, without wheels or engine, but still
graceful even in this sad state.  Voiceover:

&quot;The VW microbus, a legendary vehicle, descendent of the engineering
genius of Ferdinand Porsche and the unique vision of Ben Pon&quot; (etc., etc.,
insert more pompous stuff here)

Cut from view of bus to meeting room, somewhere in USA, tempers are high:

&quot;Look, we'll never save it, look at that rocker rust.&quot;
&quot;It's a BUS, goddammit, we can't just leave it there!&quot;
&quot;Yeah, Bob's right, no bus is not worth trying to salvage&quot;

Soon, a rescue mission, organized by the &quot;vanagon list crazies&quot; as
they are known, sets out for the frozen wastes, carting metric tons
of tools and parts, with plenty of homebrew and prunes for the
long task ahead.

Heated arguments ensue over the best engine to install in the bus,
now lovingly referred to as &quot;the V-bird&quot;

&quot;Stock, I say, Stock, anything more than a 1600 single port is
heresy&quot;
&quot;Oh, come on, at least slap a 1776 in it&quot;
&quot;Hey, I have an idea, and a spare Chevy V6, hmmmm just might work!&quot;
&quot;OK look at this plan:  I have a theory that a magnesium fire,
confined to a small space, say about the size of an engine compartment,
with the only exit being an old Stinger exhaust pipe, would be a novel
and exciting method of propulsion!!!!&quot;
&quot;I say a modified steam engine would still be best, and free hot
showers, too!&quot;

The final decision, a 1600 dual port with doghouse cooler, is decided
upon and carefully implemented.  The day comes for the first test
flight of the V-bird.  All seems well as the motor roars to life:
the vanagon list crazies are beside themselves with excitement and
intoxicated by the sound of the powerful flat-4 motor.  They start
to move, when suddenly smoke pours out of the engine compartment,
the crew bails out, and they all sadly watch months of planning
and work burn to a crisp.  The dread brass tube had worked its way
out of the 31-PICT 3, spewing gasoline everwhere.  Fade out to
a really sad bunch of folks lamenting

&quot;Shit, my tools were in there&quot;
&quot;Yeah, mine too.&quot;
