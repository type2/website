My buses VIN doesn't follow the xxx-xxx-xxx (although it looks 
similar).  My tag looks as follows:

My chasis number is 325192.  According to the chart here, do I have a 
'58???

The year (Baujahr) is blank!


according to the Book of Progressive Refinements,  

324 344   -  end of Jan 58
332 599   -  end of Feb 58

looks like your bus was built in early February 1958

it was not until August 1964 (1965 model year) that the xxx-xxx-xxx system
was introduced.

the first three digits of the later system indicate model and year of
production

the initial 2 means it's a type 2 - transporter
the second number is the model -
     model  21 is the delivery van  (no windows on sides, no seats in back,
one tone paint)
     model  22  is the Microbus  (headliner,  3 windows on sides,  interior
panels, rear and middle seats, two tone paint)
     model  23  is the Kombi  (3 windows on sides,  no interior panels or
headliner,  rear seat standard)  These were made into Westy campers
      model  24  is  the Microbus Deluxe  (4 windows on sides, trim on
beltline &amp;bumpers, more shiny trinkets, sometimes w/ sunroof &amp; skylight
windows)
      model  26  is the pick-up and double cab pick-up
      model  27   is the ambulance
      model  28  is the  walk through front seat Microbus

the third number is the last number of year of production

so my old 73 poptop's VIN  started with 233...
a  66 deluxe's VIN would start with  246...


are you REALLY still thinking you'll sell your bus.   really?
