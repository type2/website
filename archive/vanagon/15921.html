&gt; &gt;Hmmm... I don't think my bus would go 60 in third without blowing up.  Even

&gt; &gt;this that you are talking about?
&gt; 
&gt; Most buses I've driven '63,'67,'71, (this one is 1971) I have taken to 60 in
&gt; third, I used to take the squareback to 70.  I will rev that high if I have
&gt; a loaded, (this means four or five people and gear) and I'm on a long hill
&gt; that I know fourth won't quite hold if I shift.  I'd rather a lightly loaded
&gt; high rev than a bogged down 2250 rpm.  I reprimand any driver of my bus that
&gt; shifts too early, or too late on a down shift (~48-52mph into the hill).
&gt; I've followed trucks down hills at 90 and the engine sounded great.

You've taken a '63 and '67 but to 60 in 3rd?  How high was the cliff?
Or were they 'slammed to the ground' with a Bus Boys kit?
I'm going 4000 in 4th at 60 mph.  And 4000 is about 45 mph in 3rd.
I'd guess that David is doing about 4500 at 60 mph in 3rd... I'd be 
doing about 50 at 4500 in 3rd.

&gt; I believe my Haynes book, 4400 rpm limit on the bus, after that, HD singles
&gt; or duals.

That's nice.  I've done 5000 in my bus with regular springs.  But I 
prefer keeping below 4500.  And for regular driving I try to not exceed 
4000.  Mainly because it gets so noisy.
