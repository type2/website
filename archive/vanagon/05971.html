Well, this weekend I wen down and had a chat with the place that builds the 
good engines, and I explained my situation.  Of courese they recommended a 
new engine, and steered me away from the short block solution.

I'm going to get (as soon as savings allow) a &quot;rebuilt&quot; 1600.  For $650,
this baby comes with a NEW AS21 case, NEW heads, NEW P/C, NEW oil pump,
NEW Bearings, seals, etc.  It seems the only things used are the crank 
and flywheel.  _And_ I'm going to get it with a 6V 200mm flywheel. (not
the 180mm)

Sometime this week I'm going to put down my deposit.  Only bummer is, I
also need to get the SO (subliminalmansezballandchain) a d-day I mean
d-day present, so that'll will subtract from funds available for my new
toy.

So thats my decision.  I'm going to keep it 6V for now, but I'm really 
leaning towards changing to 12, 'cause that fridge is looking better and 
better every day!

BTW _ Did you know that you have to re-hone the cylinders if you take
the motor apart after running it - even if you run it a little bit?  I
didn't know it either 'til this guy told me.  It seems the rings wear
a pattern in the circumference of the cylinder, and if you put them back in,
you more than likely aren't going to get them back exactly in the same
position, and then it'll burn oil from mile 1!
