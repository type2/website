     Dogs should be on a leash all the time in any outdoor enviroment.
     Why you ask?  Simple dogs have a BIG advantage over all nature:
     living with humans, getting feed well, in warm homes in the winter.
     Then for a monent they are let free in the wild, they really cause
     great harm to nature, just there smell on a trail is enough to
     keep most other animals away for a week. 

     If you go to parks with your dogs, keep in mine many other animals
     are trying to servive there.

&gt; &gt;I just consulted my guide book on where to take dogs in CA, and it indicates
&gt; &gt;that Inyo National Forest is fine for dogs as long as they are on a leash
&gt; &gt;while in the campground and on the trails. When out of the campground they 
&gt; &gt;can
&gt; &gt;run to their hearts content. Hope this is accurate information.

&gt; You are partially correct. On *this* Forest, doggies have to be on 
&gt; leashes in developed areas and are free to run wild on trails in the 
&gt; front country as well as the backcountry. But - when I take Bianca into 
&gt; the backcountry she is free to romp as long as we are alone... but as 
&gt; soon as we encounter other people, she goes on a leash - One never 
&gt; knows who the dog haters are - and I, for one, don't want to get into 
&gt; it with them.
