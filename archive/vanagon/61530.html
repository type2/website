Hello,

Being from Colorado, I use a large caliber German Shepard who was raised
with this vanagon.  NOBODY gets in &quot;his&quot; van without me (includes
mechanics!).  No problems for 6 years now :)

&gt; Well, being from the Bronx, we tend to put &quot;protected by 357 Magnum&quot;
&gt; sticker on the window.  However, it usually doesn't work. So, a friend in
&gt; Brooklyn with VW who uses the cigarette lighter as the cut-off switch.
&gt;  He simply takes the lighter when he parks the car.  Another friend had a
&gt; removable steering wheel.  It is supposedly designed so that even if the
&gt; wheel is not present, the thief can't put a wrench around the column and
&gt; drive off.

&gt; 
&gt; After reading a few stories of car and van theft on the VW USENET
&gt; groups, I'm wondering what people on the list are doing to minimize
&gt; the risk of theft.  I realize that a determined thief will get your
&gt; vehicle, no matter what.  But how to best deter the small time
&gt; hotwire and smash 'n grab variety?
&gt; 
&gt; Alarms, hidden cutoff switches, steering wheel locks, or just
&gt; &quot;fuggedaboudit?&quot;  I know we're not driving Testarossas here, but I'd
&gt; like to hang on to the vehicles I have.
&gt; 
&gt; Ideas?  Experiences?  I've been fortunate not to have been a victim
&gt; of any vehicle related crime, so statistics would say I'm due.  :-(
