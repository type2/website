Joel, you can change the stats.  I'm bringin' TWO with me!
One is an '86 Syncro 7 pass.(which I plan to offer to worthy
listmembers for sale) and a mongrel Chevy 2.8l V6 powered ex-diesel 7
pass. which won't drive due to some head gasket failure that the ex-ex
owner experienced.  I plan to go through it thoroughly as money
permits.  I live just outside of Macon, Ga now and I'm so glad to be a
listmember again.  My former screen name was VdubDude_at_AOL_dot_com  How
I've missed this list and the friends that I made with it last year.
Someone tell me some appropriate way of how to show affection for a
list of friends, most of whom I've never met.
