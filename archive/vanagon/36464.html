Subject: Leaking fuel

Sorry for the preliminary post- closer inspection shows a leaking fuel line
above starter motor.  It is leaking at the junction directly above the
starter, on the line that runs from the fuel pump forward.

Working from the rear of the car to the front, a metal fuel line goes through
a metal anchor point at the front of the engine compartment, and is clamped
to about an inch and a half of rubber hose.  Out from that is another metal
tube, that goes a couple inches into some sort of flexible tubing, without a
hose clamp.  This flexible stuff is darkened with gasoline for the last inch
or so.  That is where the leak is, I assume.

It only leaks with the car running.


Questions:

How hard is this line to replace.  It's up there and looks like kind of a
pain in the *ss.

I'm assuming I should not drive at all, as the leaking fuel would be near the
exhaust pipes.

Any tips or tricks or advice?

Thanks

Peter Krogh
