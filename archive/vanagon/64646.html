&gt; Subject: Who makes a good awning for '85
&gt;
&gt; Anyone know of a manufacturer of a good awning for an '85 Vanagon?
&gt;
&gt; scr
&gt;

A&amp;E (the parent company of Dometic, mfg. of the standard Westy fridges)
makes a very nice awning specifically for small RV's and vans.  I have a
Catalina Model 2500 in the 8' length mounted on the rain gutter (using the
special van mounting kit they provide for this purpose) and have been very
pleased with it so far.

Quite nicely constructed and a very clever design:  All components fit
snugly into a solid (and fairly compact) aluminum case.  Surprisingly, very
quiet on the road (no rattles to date).  Easy to mount and dismount, though
so far I've just left it in place.  Tight clearance to the van though, so
it does require some care in extending/retracting the awning (the van door
must be closed to allow the struts to clear when dropping them down from
the case).  Spare parts and/or repairs are available from local dealers or
the factory (though probably pretty pricey).

Got mine from Camping World for about $300 w/ van mounting kit.  A couple
of tips:  1)  I highly recommend that you do the installation yourself
rather than let the hack RV techs at CW decide on placement and mounting
methods.  2)  Cut small strips of protective vinyl to cushion the van
mounting brackets in and around the rain gutter attachment points (I used
3M &quot;Safety Walk&quot; Home &amp; Recreation Tread - a very useful product, BTW). If
you mount them bare, you will chip the rain gutter paint.  3)  If you're
not  satisfied with the color selection offered in the catalog, ask about
special ordering 'custom' colors.  Many additional colors are available -
for no additional charge - from A/E, that may go better with your van than
some of the typical cheesy/festive colors from RV palette.

Only real question to date has been whether to mount the support strut
clips to the Vanagon body (requiring 4 holes to be drilled!!) or continue
securing the support struts to the van wheels (using an elastic shock cord
device I made), which limits the extension of the awning somewhat.  Any
feedback from other Vanagon awning owners would be appreciated.
