&gt; 
&gt; I've just finished going over the van &quot;repairing&quot; superficial rust spots,
&gt; (you know, the little dings on the edges of doors, esp. the leading
&gt; edge of the sliding door), with a product from &quot;plasti-Cote&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; I can't remember the trade name, but it is a milky-white, almost latex
&gt; looking liquid which you paint onto the affected area (after removing any
&gt; loose rust, but not sanding down to bare metal), and as it dries, it turns
&gt; the rust a black colour and leaves a slightly amber plastic coating. I did
&gt; it purely as a stop-gap remedy until I can do the proper touch-up paint
&gt; routine. The resulting coating seems, so far, to be quite tough.
&gt; 
Rustoleum makes a product called &quot;Rust Reformer&quot;, which goes on white,
and then dries black. As a split window owner, Iswear by the stuff!
