&gt; Particularly galls me when I go in and they ask how much I want to spend.

I had that experience several times.  Several years ago while looking for a
used car for my sister sales vultures would come up and ask how much was I
willing to spend.  And that's before even looking at anything!

Now, in my area it seems, they don't want to be bothered.  So instead they
have &quot;greeters&quot; that will send you to a salesman only if you are willing to
buy.
