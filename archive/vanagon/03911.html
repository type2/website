&gt; What happened to the caravan thing?  Was it just one
&gt; of those things that died?  Was my name taken off
&gt; the list?  Just because I refuse to travel in the
&gt; USA doesn't mean that I'm not interested in the 
&gt; discussion or the final plans you all might come
&gt; up with.  Huh?  Someone fill me in please.  I
&gt; forgot who's managing the list.  But whoever you are;
&gt; why did you take me off?  I don't remember asking to
&gt; be removed.  Or did the logistics of the thing just get
&gt; to be too much and it died a quiet death?

That was me , David Schwarze, that was (and still is) organizing
the BAA (to be named more appropriately, soon, I hope) tour.  You
have not been taken off of the &quot;list&quot;, nor has anyone else.  Interest
has just waned lately in general, and I haven't been doing much thinking
about the trip.  The fact that my bus isn't running doesn't help my
enthusiasm either, but I'll post about that nightmare separately.

I attended a vintage vw show here in San Diego yesterday at Mission Bay
Volkswagen.  It was bigger and better than I expected.  There was the
usual assortment of bugs and type III's, and seven or eight beautiful
transporters.  Turns out there is a local type II club here, but it is
only for pre '68 busses :(   I did talk to the president about our
trip, though, and he promised to disseminate (sp?) any information
about the trip to his members that I give him.  There were two beautiful
Westys there, a 66 and a 67.  There was also a 50's vintage crew cab
restored to immaculate condition - beautiful!  

I also looked at the Eurovan Winnebago that was on display.  32K for
that puppie (ouch!) but it was, indeed nice.  Especially the little
shower nozzle thing in back.
