Subject: Paging David Schwarze!....

Does anyone out there plan on talking to Mr. Schwarze in the coming 
couple a days?  We want to meet up with him and whoever else is planning 
to go shooting thru Washington State on the 11th, but don't know where 
these folks are staying.  June 11th, Olympic Peninsula: where, exactly, 
on the Olympic Peninsula is my question.
I'm rambling now.
	Just thought it would be cool to see folks for an evening of 
colorful yet oh-so-noxious burning magnesium and exploding Chicken of the 
Sea -- Joel, your coverage of the BBTA took me away, brother...
	And!  I have a Dead-stickered camper which I maintain with utmost 
care (due for a paint job in 2 weeks!).  Upon seeing umpteen bazillion 
thrashed buses at last weekend's Deadfest _at_ Memorial Stadium in Seattle, 
I may indeed be in the minority (one feller I met said he picks up a bus, 
drives it til it dies, then somehow finds another and same deal- drives 
it to its death.  Here's the kicker: 4 buses from Las Vegas to Seattle 
that week :-0   ).
	Oh yeah- if ya see Dave, ask him where he's staying in Washington :-)
	Jeff
