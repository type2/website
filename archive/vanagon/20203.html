Subject: baja dates


I've just returned from a short vacation and have looked over all
the input on the Baja dates.  The preferred date seems to be for
the last weekend in October (apologies to Diane Wagner, but we
promise her the celebration of a lifetime).  For those of you
who suggested going Wed. before the weekend, and returning the
Monday, after, this would put the dates at:

Wed. October 25 - Monday October 30, 1995.

Those of you who cannot make that large of a time span can join and
leave when necessary.

I know that many of you need to know these dates as far in advance
as possible to arrange vacation time, etc.  So, am hoping this
works out for all of you, and suggest that we all put the dates
on our calender firmly at this time.

As I know relatively little about Mexico/Baja, I'd like to suggest
that those of you on the list who have more experience/interest in
this (Reilly, Garth, Hoover, etc.) do the actually planning
and itinerary, and I'll volunteer to help with the roster, mailings,
posts, food, whatever, etc.
