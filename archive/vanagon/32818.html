Subject: Need Advice on Fixing Rust Spots


hey now,

we've just about gottent the interior of my '74 Retrowestie done...in the 
meantime, while the weather is decently warm and dry i'm going to take care
of some rust spots. nothing major, just some small areas. 

i've removed some rust using a rust remover and sanded the rest off. i 
now have a nice smooth metal surface. i assume now i just prime it and 
then try to get a paint that matches as close as possible to the original.

so the steps are to:

a) remove the rust
b) sand it down
c) use newspapers to block of all but affected area
d) prime
e) sand if it's a sandable primer
f) paint

could anyone offer some suggestions if this ain't right? want to get this 
done sometime today or tommorrow. 

as usually, i appreciate your help!
