Subject: [A] '73 Westy help - THANKS!

I wanted to thank everyone for their help with my pushrod tube

(and previously, carb) problems. As it turned out, I hadn't pushed

the tubes far enough into the engine. The new seals made it a little

too hard to do with my hand, but a few very light taps with a screwdriver

and hammer popped them right into place. Also, thanks for the advice

on the spring-retainer ... that wasn't quite in properly either.

My starting problems with the carb turned out to be bad gas. On a hunch,

My dad filled up the float with new gas, and it started right up. We drained

the tank, and everything is OK. The van had been sitting for some time, but

I never suspected the gas. wow.

Thanks again, I really appreciate everyone's help. By the end of this week,

there will be one more ''73 Westy on the road.
