Dear Vanatics;
Has anyone had any dealings with this company?  I briefly spoke with the
proprietor, Bill Liggett, when our paths crossed at the filling
pump.They do custom work and service on vans and campers. He gave me the
nickel tour of his syncro Westfalia. It was loaded down with every gadget
imaginable. Their phone number is 1-800-VANAGON. I am going to try and
check them out this weekend.
Good Luck
Ken Lewis
