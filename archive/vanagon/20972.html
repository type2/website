&gt; Now I find that the wiring kit that came with the head temp gauge is about

&gt; sensitive this thing
&gt; is to the length of wire? the instructions mention not shortening the wire, but
&gt; nothing about lengthening it! I'm assuming that the increase in resistance
&gt; will simply cause the readings to be subject to a simple translation  -
&gt; I'll try to
&gt; measure it once I finish hooking up the other wires. Just wondered if anyone had
&gt; already done so.

10 *ft* too short? I assume you mean inches. The wire is 15 ft. long and 
it was just the right length (not 2 inches too long) for my baywindow 
bus. It goes from #3 spark plug through the fire wall (same hole as fuel 
line), under the bus and back into the cabin through a hole in the 
floor next to the shift lever, then under the carpet to the front and up 
to the dash, above the ash tray.

Later, because I wanted to add a second wire with a sender from cylinder
#1, I added an on/off/on switch between the gauge and the wires. The new
wire from the switch to the gauge is 1 foot long and quite fat:  #10
gauge. The reading on the gauge has not been affected in any way.

Hope this helps.
