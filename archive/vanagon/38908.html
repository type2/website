Subject: Buses on the Blue Ridge

NEATO information for BOTBR is on my Home page for those interested
http://www.teleplex_dot_net/cwebb/buses.html
There is a map and contact person. They had around 45 last year.
I've stayed at this campground and it is real nice. The Mt Pisgah Inn 
has the best buffet with a view.
