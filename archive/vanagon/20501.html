     &gt;The other one is called &quot;Volkswagen Camper&quot;.  It's No. 34 in a series 
     &gt;from 1965 I seem to recall so it's a split window (cool).  The color 
     &gt;is silver with yellow tinted windows (including the sunroof in a 
     &gt;slightly raised roof area). The interior is orange and has facing 
     &gt;seats in the rear with a table between. Once again this van is 
     &gt;right-hand drive with the side door in the left side (these open!).
     
     I'll check it out in my Matchbox collectors guide tonight.
     
     &gt;Uh, I also found my die-cast Millenium Falcon but you guys probably 
     &gt;wouldn't care about that.
     
     extra cool ship!
