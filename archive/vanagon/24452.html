&gt; 
&gt; While I have a ' 71 Kombi that has the canister removed and have noe problem
&gt; with it---there is my ' 73 Super that has had her canister removed and I ma
&gt; having a great deal of a problem with Gas odor. So bad in fact that she has
&gt; been retired to short trip duty.  There is another post regarding my problem
&gt; on the Vanagon list as well as the Vinatgvw list. and again any help with my
&gt; gas odor problem will be greatly rewarded with a donation of some of the
&gt; brain cells that I won't be burning up while smelling all of these gas fumes.
&gt;  Peace :{0&gt;

It is probably not your misssing charcol canister that is causing the odor.
A gas smell that occurs typically with a full tank and/or left turns
is caused by a leak in one or more of the gas tank hoses near the filler
spout. Check it out. I had a really good left turn indicator for
several months before I figured it out and replaced some hoses on one of
our '72 supers.
