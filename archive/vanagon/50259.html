Subject: Re: Kombi question again


To keep you updated:

Yesterday I spotted a Syncro Eurovan Panelwagon
with factory high roof and long wheel base. This
will be a nice candidate for homebrew campers.

A description of the 'Vanagon Syncro Kombi' and
the 'Vanagon Multi Van', which seems to be
different of the German version, I like to send
next.
