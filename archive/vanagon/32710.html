Hello All,

When it comes to this possum stuff, I don't have to take them home.  =
With the '74 P-27 Deluxe Campmobile, I can cook 'em on the spot with the =
propane stove and store the leftovers in the fridge!

Best possum recipe &quot;Ernest T's Possum and Sweet Taters&quot;

1 1/2 pound baking potato
1 young possum (2 1/2 lbs) Dressed
4 tsp Salt
3/4 tsp black pepper
1/8 tsp red pepper
3 Tbsp all-purpose flour
2 lbs sweet potatoes, peeled

Peel baking potato and place it inside the possum.  Place the possum in =
a large kettle and cover with cold water.  Boil gently, uncovered for =
about 30 minutes.  Pour off the broth and add fresh water.  Return to a =
boil and cook slowly, partially covered, until tender when pierced, but =
not falling off the bone. Remove the possum to a roasting pan and =
sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Blend the flour with cold water until smooth.  Combine the flour mixture =
with enough of the hot broth to make 2 cups of gravy.  Arrange the sweet =
potatoes around the possum.  Pour the gravy over the meat and potatoes.  =
Cover. Bake in a 375 degrees oven until the potatoes are nearly done, =
about 20 minutes.  Uncover and bake, basting often, until the meat =
browns and the potatoes are soft, about 40 minutes.
Serve hot.  This is good with turnip greens, cornbread, and baked =
apples.
