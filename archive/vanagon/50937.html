Subject: Re: Unstick Lock Key Holes?


Try using penetrating oil...WD40 is only a water displacer/lubricant...what 
you need is something that will disolve the crud in your lock and free up 
the mechanism. Use lots of it....once the lock is freed up, spray some lock 
graphite into the lock, that will help to prevent any future problems.

BTW...where on the Cape do you live?
