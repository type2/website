Subject:  saw(ed) bus

i was on my maiden adventurewagen northern michigan camping voyage
this weekend (only saw one other vw van, we both waved), and drove
through a little town called scottsville, in the middle of nowhere.   the sign
said 'home of the world-famous scottsville clowns'.  interesting (not
really), no further thought was given to it.  on the other side of town i
passed a small import auto repair shop, and they had one of those
scrunched buses (only a few feet between the front and rear wheels)
in front, a splittie no less.  of course i had to stop and check it out, and on
the engine door was a picture of a hamster in a treadmill, running the
flywheel. the thing was pretty much trashed.  how repulsively cute and
depressing, i thought.  must have been some clown's bus.
