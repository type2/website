Ok, here's mine:

	I had to pull the engine of a '67 kombi I had, in order to 
fix an oil cooler leak.

	I've got everything ready to go, I just have to pull the fuel line
off.  I climb under, pencil in one hand, screwdriver in the other, and 
start taking the line off.  When I got the clamp loose, I tugged on the line
to pull it off, and it did come off, spraying gas all over the place,
and pouring all over my shop light - one of the ones with the screw-in
incandescent bulb.  Instant fire.  

	I jumped out from under, and tried to figure out what to do.  I
had no extinguisher, next door neighbor was parked on the garden hose,
so I was screwed. So I decided the next thing was to push it out of the 
garage.  Well, my friend had his car parked in front of the bus.  With 
the car locked!  And the bus in in back-end first.  So he goes to get 
his keys, I go in to call the FD and inform the SO, who is in the shower,
what is going on.  I can't get in the front door because it it _locked_, so
I have to dash past the burning bus (between it and another car) to get into
the house.  Go back out after getting off the phone with the FD,
and tried to go thru the door between the garage and the kitchen.  Mistake.
Smoke comes billowing into the house.  At least I had the presence of mind to
shut the door.  I then have to go aorund the front, release the brake, and
pull the bus out of the garage.  The bus is now about 50% involved, because
the rear hatch was open, and it basically lit the entire inside on fire.
As the bus startes rolling down the driveway (luckily it had a good slope
away from the house) the rear tires blew.  It I had waited 5 more seconds,
they would have blown with the bus _inside_ the garage and I would have
been screwed++.

	So then I got to sit there and watch the bus burn while waiting for 
the fire department.  By now the entire neighborhood, which watched me 
restore this thing from the ground up, is watching.

	To add insult to injury, all my surf gear was in the bus.  We were
going surfing that morning, but I turned back when the oil line blew,
and limped home to fix it.  Surfboards, wetsuits, the whole nine yards
was in there.

	There's a picture of whats left of the bus on

	Another factor was that I was a fireman for 6 years, so I was 
s'posed to know better.

	I've never loved any bus like I loved that '67 kombi (which was
my first bus)

	And thats my idiot story.  I'm going to go be depressed now.
