Subject: Was flakey heater fan switch now broken heater door wire!


Plunked down $14 for a new switch so I now have forced front heat in my  
'85 van but to my dismay the cable/wire that opens the flaps for interior 
heat broke. Is this the one where you have to take the dash completely 
apart to replace?

Thanks for all the replies to my prvious post about the switch. The parts 
guy suggested that I only run on speeds 1 &amp; 2. Well that's all well and 
fine until the freezing morning commute. Maybe I'll just hardwire a crowbar 
switch in for that nice form fits function look!
