Subject: Re: 79 Water-cooled Bus?

I don't know about the catalogue, but on a trip to Baja with a buddy in 
his '71 Westy, he said something about 
being able to have this conversion (retro watercooling w/a radiator where 
the spare goes) done in Mex, but not being able to 
bring it back into the US.  I don't remember the details of what he said 
(I was probably nursing a vicious tequila hangover, or something ;) 
except that it was supposed to be inexpensive.

factory he calls work :(

&gt; I just got a J.Crew clothing catalogue in the mail (the Vacation 1997 issue).
&gt; And on page 117 there is a light blue (actually I guess it's gray primer)
&gt; late 70s Westfalia bus with a fairly large black radiator grill on the front.
&gt; In the center of the grill is the VW symbol. It's hard to tell from the photo
&gt; but it looks like it is more than a cosmetic alteration. If anyone has this
&gt; catalogue or knows of the actual bus and knows the story of it, I'd love to
&gt; know. I'm guessing the photo was taken in California. Or if the catalogue is
&gt; kicking around your house check it out this oddity. I realize it's not a
&gt; Vanagon but it piqued my interest and I thought it might interest others.
