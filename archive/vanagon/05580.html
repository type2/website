Subject: Re: Street camping

This summer we did 2.5 months of street camping on the west coast w/ no 
problems - just loud sometimes. -ok usually it was out of town on top of a hill,
ridge, side road etc.  In most cities it is illegal.  Santa Cruz has become 
fascist about and even telluride is gettin' rid of it (too much money in that 
town now)!  Cheap/free campgrounds aren't easy to find (CA state is $12?) and
would you stay in a KOA?
