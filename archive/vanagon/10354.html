&gt; &gt;&gt;Does someone have the 'specs' on compression for a 2.1L  per VW?  I know the real 
&gt; &gt;&gt;world ones run around 110psi (low end) on up but I'm curious as to 
&gt; &gt;&gt;what the actual spec is.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;TIA --  Dan
&gt; &gt;&gt;

 How about this for a &quot;rule-of-thumb&quot;? Take atmospheric pressure and multiply
 by compression ratio; For a wasserboxer that would be 14.7 times 8.something,
 ending up a little over 120 psi, right? For a type IV it would be 14.7 times
 7.3 = 107. Any thoughts, men and women of automotive science?
