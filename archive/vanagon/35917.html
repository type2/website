Subject: While on the subj of VWs on tv...

...anybody watch recent episodes of that PBS show where the guy travels
through Europe and shows how to do and enjoy things the non-touristy
way?  The show is called something like &quot;Rick Steves' Travel Through
Europe&quot; (quelle surprise, eh?).  Anyway, to link this back to Vanagons,
this guy is tooling round Germany in a Westy (or is that Westie? Nah,
can't be, that's a dog.)

Cool show...nice car, too!
