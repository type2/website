Same thing happened to me - on a saturday night!

Camelback VW/Saab
1499 E. Camelback Rd.
Phoenix,  AZ  85014
(602) 265-6600
(800) 876-5199

Fast, friendly service. 20% Net-user discount. Use 'em all the time. Make a
note of the 800# - call 'em when you have the problem, two days later you
have part, mostly.
