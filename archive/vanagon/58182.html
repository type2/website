    Man I think you found my problem!!!! My mixture screw doesn't
    do much backed out, just the same!!!!

     Please post this to the list!!! I'am sure that others would
     benefit!  I would but I have been kicked off!


        Thanks

&gt; &gt;     Hummmmm..... return spring in the sensor.... Could you be more
&gt; &gt;     specific as to what this is, and what you did?
&gt; 
&gt; In the &quot;swing arm&quot; type sensor (like L-Jetronic) the movement of the air 
&gt; vane is resisted by a wound spring which looks like the spring in a old 
&gt; clock.  Over time this spring weakens, which results in the air vane 
&gt; staying in a more &quot;open&quot; (i.e., rich) position than when it was new.  In 
&gt; my case, the spring was weak enough that even with the idle mixture screw 
&gt; backed out fully, the mixture was still too rich.
&gt; 
&gt; If you pop the plastic top to the air sensor you can see the spring.  
&gt; It's below a toothed wheel to which it's attached.  The wheel is kept 
&gt; from spinning by a spring-steel lever arm which is lodged in one of the 
&gt; teeth.  The idea is to turn this toothed wheel in a clockwise direction, 
&gt; which &quot;winds&quot; the spring, more effectively resisting the movement of the 
&gt; air vane.
&gt; 
&gt; If you try it, mark the position of the wheel so you can put things back 
&gt; the way they were if you need to.  Put the idle air mixture screw in the 
&gt; middle of its range of adjustment.  With the engine completely warmed up, 
&gt; detach the O2 sensor and attach a volt meter to it.  Then turn the wheel 
&gt; (it helps to have a third hand) clockwise until you bring the voltage 
&gt; from the O2 meter into the .5 volt range.
