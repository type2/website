&gt;The noise does not care a bit about engine speed. Doesn't matter whether
&gt;I'm in fourth or third. But I can make it cycle with the accelerator,
&gt;putting it under load and backing off. It's much louder under load.

&gt;I replaced the right rear wheel bearings. If I had to guess, I'd say it's
&gt;coming from the rear, and the right wheel had lots of play in it. Lovely
&gt;new FAG bearings and seals with lots of slippery grease. Took five hours.
&gt;The noise perseveres.

Well I had a similar noise comming from the back of my Tercel up
until yesterday. It was _definitely_ coming from the _BACK_.
Exactly like you described. After checking back bearings, and brakes, 
to no avail, changing the FRONT wheel bearing fixed it. Just
got it back last night, and coming to work this morning, the silence was 
deafing.
MORAL of the story. Check the front wheel bearings if the noise seems to come 
from the back??
