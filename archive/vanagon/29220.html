Did you REALLY want to know this?  Not sure I did.  When I
saw the post that ONE PIECE of green glass for the roof
windows of a deluxe was going for $125 and that it would
take $1,000 to replace them all (minus rubber of course) the
future of our *hobby* came into focus.  I have never been in
this for the money but you have to know there ARE people who
are.  There are also people who have finally realized what
we knew several decades ago but they now have the money and
desire to pay for what they once considered to be junk.


I don't know who wanted $125 for one skylight window,  but does that mean
they actually sold it for that?  It's rediculous.    There's also a sucker
born every day.
