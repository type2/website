Subject: Wannabusser No More!

Saturday we picked up our first VW of any description, the 82 Vanagon
Poptop.  

After many months of perusing the list, For Sale Ads, etc., the decision
was heavily influenced by the &quot;comfort factor&quot; of it being local, here in
Toronto, knowing (hopefully) what we're getting ourselves into, with the
mechanic/dealer giving a 90 day warranty on the work (I'm not mechanically
inclined, and will have to rely on/pay others to do most work).

Fridge, stove and sink were all there - still have to confirm that
everything is working.  238,000 K. on the odometer.  Some rust on the seams
and front, but less than others we've seen of that vintage.  Small tear in
canvas to be repaired, and many holes in mesh to be replaced (any ideas how
to do this without removing the canvas)?

Mechanical parts/work done supposedly included:
- 1 set pistons/cylinders
- 1 engine gasket set
- 8 push rod tubes
- 2 rebuilt cylinder heads
- 1 clutch slave metal line
- 2 brake cables
- 1 used muffler
- brake lines
- clutch main line

With &quot;safety check&quot; (Ontario gov't requirement), install parts as listed,
bleed brake system, service front/rear brakes, sale price was Cdn$4000.
Add about another Cdn$1500 for our various taxes, license fees, and a years
worth of insurance for the 2nd vehicle, and, after a major cleaning of the
interior, we should be all ready for action.

Any suggestions for a cleaning/shampoo of the upholstery?

On the first day out, we already experienced the &quot;start/stop/start&quot;
syndrome from recent postings - more details to follow.
