Subject: FS: 68 bug 

I picked up the 68 bug today.  My bus now has an engine donor!  The engine 
is a 71 1600 DP, and the car is up for sale.  The swingaxle tranny is in 
good shape, and it has 5 good tires, like very low miles.  4 lug wheels.  
The rest isn't much to write home about.  The body is real rusty, I guess 
there is more that could be had in the way of glass and such, but you'd have 
to have a look and see.

Way cheap here, I'll sell the whole car for $50~100, or in parts.
 
If anyone is interested, mail me at the address in my .sig file.

I'm in Christiansburg, VA which is about 4 1/2 hours from DC.
