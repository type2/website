Mine leaked where the valve is you use to turn the heat on and off, I don't 
have the Bently with me but I do remember one of the screws (or threads) was 
stripped where the hose connects.

Subject:  87 Vanagon- Antifreeze smell


Hello to all-

Every time I use the rear auxiliary heater (under the rear bench seat) in my 
van, I smell antifreeze!  I recently removed the rear seat to gain access 
the heater core and let the van idle for an hour or so and couldn't see any 
leaks or indication of leaks...   The antifreeze level has slightly dropped 
over the last couple of months (approx 0.25 inch in the overflow tank).

Has anybody else experienced this?  Have any ideas?

Thanks
