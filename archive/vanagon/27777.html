Subject: need vanagon westy table leg


I thought I had a lead a few weeks ago on acquiring a vanagon westy table
leg.  Unfortunately, the person couldn't locate it, and I've still been
unable to find one in a junkyard.  I'm in need of the pipe-pole, and hopefully,
the thing it fits in to, on the under side of the table.  I already have
the thing it fits into which is attached to the camper.  I'
am interested in either leg, front or back, and the height doesn't much matter.

TIA,
