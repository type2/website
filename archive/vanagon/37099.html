&gt;My circlip &quot;tool&quot; was a big screwdriver and a small needle nose pliers...
&gt; works for me.  I'm sure the &quot;proper&quot; tool would work best, but sometimes you
&gt;work with what you have!  Vise is mandatory, especially when working solo.

        Well, I did my 1st joint with the screwdrivers. Took me 1.5 hrs to
get the dammned thing off, kinda bent it in the process. Went to Sears,
spent $17 on the circlip tool, had the other 3 off in 45 minutes. Well
worth the $17 to me.

Peace,
