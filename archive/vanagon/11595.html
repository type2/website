Subject: Zinc Spray Works.

&gt;On the zinc front, why not just spray cans of those 
&gt;cold galvanizing sprays  all around under your van from 
&gt;time to time. This would distribute the zinc  all 
&gt;around instead of only at the few points that you could 
&gt;bolt a zinc  anode. Right?

I got some of this stuff and sprayed it liberally over a 
compressed fracture of the sliding door that the blue thing 
suffered when I tried to reverse into someone's front yard.  
Clever people that they are, they neglected to inform me that 
the shrub was not a shrub but a camoflage net for a concrete 
pier.  :(

The scratch was about three-quarters of an inch wide and ditto 
in depth.  It was right through to the metal but didn't 
perforate the door.  I used the zinc spray on it immediately (I 
always carry it in the Transporter - just in case) and, one 
year later, the door has not got any rust.  Here in the Emerald 
Isle, we get enough rain to dissolve even the strongest metal 
...

I go to the sea-side (almost) every evening in the summer to 
dive and such. As the blue thing is used as a changing room, it 
gets quite salty.  A light spray of the zinc on the door sills 
has kept them corrosion-free too.
