Subject:       Re: restoring interior chrome

Hi All.  I use a product made in Germany called Wenol.  It can be 
used on all metals.  They even make one specifically for Automobile 
Chrome.  I use the regualar (red box), and it does an excellent job 
on stainless steel in the van, and our pots/pans, etc.  It's good for 
copper, brass, ss, chrome, etc.  Even silver, gold.  It is a cream 
and comes in toothpatste like tubes or in a can.  A 50 ml tube is 
around $10 CDN, but a little goes a long way.  I even use it on our 
knives.  

Harry.
