Have tried thickeners only in a bug engine. Result? They seem to work for
about a tankfull and after that you are back where you started. You are
better off running a single weight 40 or a 20w50 than an oil thickener
addditive. A 40 weight might be even better for an engine burning
oil...if cold starts are not an issue. DC 

I would not recommend anyone using 10w30 above temps of 50 degrees for
extended periods in
any air-cooled engine....that's not my opinion; that's the manual's.... 
That is why a 5w50 synthetic intrigues me...the best of both worlds?
