  Our EV MV is almost the same age as Don Drisdell's and has about 42k miles.
I just noticed rust blistering at the bottom of the passenger's front door.
The other places Don has found rust are not problems yet. Not that I've no-
ticed anyway.

   As for warranty coverage: don't know; doesn't &quot;perforation&quot; mean a complete
hole through the sheet metal?

   Thanks to all the EV owners who answered my last request for info on
screens and gas mileage.
