Subject: Re: Peanut butter in oil?

&gt;Today when I went to add oil to my bus ('76), I noticed a strange substance
&gt;on the inside of the filler tube. It looks like slimey peanut butter. Does
&gt;anyone know what this is? Also, what does this mean? Is my engine filled with
&gt;peanut butter and soon to self destruct? Has anyone else ever seen this?
&gt;
&gt;Currently boycotting Peter Pan until this is resolved.

Hello Bryce
     What you found is most likely emulsified oil.  Oil with water mixed
into it.  Do you do alot of short drives?  If the oil does'nt stay at
operating temperature long enough, it won't drive the moisture out, it
accumulates.  It is most noticable in the cooler areas of the engine, ie the
filler tube. After short tripsl, moisture laden air is pulled into the
engine as it cools.  It condenses on the inside of the engine, like the
moisture on a cold beer can.  The result is the formation of sludge,an
acidity increase and the production of peanut butter. :-J
