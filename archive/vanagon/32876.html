Note:  the previous story related to a VW _Bus_ being broken into...mine 
is about the opposite.  

Twice now, we have inadvertently left a door unlocked in our '92 Jetta (TD, 
mind you) overnight.  It is usually parked in back of my Kombi or right 
in front of the garage.  On these occasions, &quot;thieves&quot; have rifled 
through the glovebox and that's it--except for an old calculator and a 
chain (which carried my picture ID for work).  Both times they completely 
ignored my unlocked Kombi.  

I think it's the same guy, and I anticipate no further problems, even 
though 3 years and 8 city blocks separate the incidents.  

JKH--New Mexico
'70 Kombi (Ok, so it's a little ugly and sans a stereo)
