Subject: CV Boots


&gt;Also, how difficult (time and tools) is it to replace a boot on the cv
&gt;joint?  Mine is cracked.

I was doing mine today (bay window). It's not expensive--$6.00 at Sears for
the tool, $2.50 for a huge tube of grease, $15.00 for the boot kit. Get two
kits and do the whole axle. The kit has a chintzy tube of grease with it
but I like to make a *real* mess. ;)

It isn't difficult but it's damned nasty. You never saw so much muck
everywhere. Just take out the bolts with the tool (ten each, upper and
lower?), the axle falls out, disassemble and clean out, reassemble and
remount.

I expect if you were exceedingly careful of grit you could change the boots
out without disassembling. That would be much more elegant but you couldn't
inspect the joints that way.
