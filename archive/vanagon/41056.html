Subject: '71 Beetle for $100.00  AND IT RUNS!

All,
   I have a friend in the area, that want's to get rid of a '71 Autostick
Beetle.  The engine runs, but will need work to be safe on the road.  The pan
looks good but the wheel wells are nasty.  Exterior body looks good from a
distance, but when you walk up to it, you can see that someone did a cheep
paint job.  The color is cream.  Interior is ok.
     He needs to get this thing out of his driveway, so if anyone is
interested, please Email me with your phone number, and I'll have him call
you.
     The car is located in Plymouth, Michigan which is half way between Ann
Arbor and Detroit.
                                             Thanks,
                                                     Eric
