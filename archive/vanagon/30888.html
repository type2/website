Splittie in airport car-park in &quot;The Net&quot; &lt;groan&gt;
It was still there when she got back from wherever :-)
Most exciting bit of the film.

It doesn't count as Hollywood, but the new CompuServe ad in the UK features a
lengthened 27-window (or something!) Samba with &quot;compuserve-ized&quot; paint-job. Are
they trying to tell us something about their connection speed?
