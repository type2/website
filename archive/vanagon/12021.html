Subject: Re: trailer hitches and towing


There seems to be some interest in towing options, so I thought I
would tell everyone my solution.  I fabricated &amp; welded together a
piece that goes in the place of the front bumper on split window 
buses.  Bolts right to the frame for a solid connection.  I welded on 
attachments to the front to attach the pivots from a super beetle 
tow bar.  This works GREAT for towing split buses.

I use the same super beetle tow bar to tow bubble windows.  For them
I have steel plates that bolt on either side of the front tow hooks
on the bus and the tow bar.  They don't tow as smoothly as the splits
because the connection at the tow bar is not as rigid.

I tow them using my 77 Westfalia which has a trailer hitch which bolts
onto the frame at the same points where the bumper mounts.  I get a
lot of waves, peace signs, and weird looks as I tow a bus with a Bus!

Word of caution... take it slow and easy, and make sure your brakes 
are in adjustment because you have to stop twice as much weight.
