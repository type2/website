Subject: Cow magnets?? was: Backup halogens?


|after spending too much for the halogen replacement bulbs, i have to
|admit that they really don't do much different than the standard
|ones.  on paper, i'm sure they have twice the light output but
|combined with a cheap reflector and lousy back-up lens optics, they
|are marginal.
|
|definately, the best way to go is with a spare fog light.  fleet
|stores sell vibration resistant, waterproof, halogen &quot;tractor&quot;
|lights in fairly attractive housings that run less than $10 and can
|be bought individually.  these tractor lights have a broad, diffuse
|beam pattern for lighting wide areas.  perfect.
|
|and a perfect example of agricultural cross-technology.  just like
|taping cow magnets on your fuel line.....

******cow magnets on the fuel line?  what is that rumored to do?*****
