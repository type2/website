Subject: Re: Balky starter

&gt;Any thoughts on why my starter won't in this current -25C (-13F) weather.  
&gt;Battery fine, toasty with electric blanket around.  Solenoid fine, wiring 
&gt;fine, dual batteries BTW, spare is cold though. Yesterday it worked 
&gt;perfectly after I tapped it a couple of times, happened twice, 6hrs apart.  
&gt;This AM no go, nada.  Until I took a propane torch and warmed up the starter 
&gt;casing and the solenoid. Then instant start, no slow spinning, just like 
&gt;summertime, so I know the wiring is fine.  Is there a grease problem, 
&gt;sticking brushes, baked commutator?  It will spin fine 6+ times in a row 
&gt;once its been running too. Thoughts?  TIA, Tim
&gt;
&gt;
Problem might be weak solenoid or resistance in solenoid circuit from
ignition switch.  Check voltage at solenoid when ignition switch in  start
position and no go.  This most likely would be caused by corrosion at
solenoid connection on starter. Try cleaning connection.  Weak connection
saps solenoid of necessary current to work and it never activates far enough
to engage starter connection at the end of its stroke.  Heat applied by
torch would reduce current requirement to operate properly and/or could
affect poor connection.
