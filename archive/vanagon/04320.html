Gery skerbitz asked
&gt; &gt; &gt; Can someone tell me exactly what the vents at the bottom of the front
&gt; &gt; &gt; doors are for?

That's what I thought I heard &lt;grin&gt;

&gt; Well, I can say (again) that on my Syncro, they definately suck air from the 
&gt; cab and the air goes &quot;somewhere else&quot;.  It sucks enough to blow out
&gt; a lighted match at low speeds, and will consume all the smoke from a
&gt; cigarette (when traveling at high speeds, and the cig is within 6 inches
&gt; of the open part of the vent).

On mine, they absloutely do NOT do this.  If I open them up and put my 
hand by them, I can't figure out which way the air is going.  Geez, we 
have the fiche for this thing; we aught to be able to figure out what 
it's supposed to do.  Yikes!
