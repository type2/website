&gt;Subtle difference. Only Chris can deal with this, I expect.
&gt;Chris, is there an aliases file for situations like this?
&gt;
&gt;I'm CC:ing the list for two reasons.
&gt;1. So people realize these problems exist.
&gt;2. So people realize that sending this kind of query is more appropriately
&gt;   done to the admin - csmith_at_sdsc_dot_edu -- instead of to the list.

Gerry's almost right.  The admin account is vanagon-request_at_vanagon_dot_com.
This will go to both Chris and I, so your problem has twice the chance of
getting fixed :-)
