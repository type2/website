Am I missing something here?  I think that I can buy a Porsche 915 for 
under $1,000.  I think that I would have to fabricate a front mount, a bell 
housing adapter and get some custom length axles, but it probably wouldn't 
come near $2,200.

Comments?

Hi,

Indian Vic has some, he's a parts dealer of some sort in Florida.  He
wants, $2200US/.  Save your money.  Buy bigger tires to go faster, buy
smaller ones to accelerate faster. :)  See? wasn't that easy!

Tim
