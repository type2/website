Subject: '76 Camper in Washington-update

It was great to get so much advice and support about what to with my bus. 
Thanks everyone.  After a little more research I found a place to get the
work done that is alot nearer to Ocean Shores then the places Eric O.
mentioned.  I wish I had some references about their work, but they seemed
experienced and really straightfoward from the phone conversation, so I'm
going to take my chances with them.  They're willing to come pick up the
bus for a reasonable tow charge and are going to give me a full
diagnosis/estimate before starting work.   When I get out there for the
holidays I'll most likely have transportation waiting for me, which is a
major plus.  Eric--thanks again for the offer to help me tow/repair it,
sounds like it would have been fun.    I'll give you a call when I'm in the
area, maybe we could have a beer or something. 
 
--Evan
