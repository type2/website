&gt;
&gt;        The 12V Sink pump and switch are completely shot, need new 
ones.
&gt;Any suggestions as to where to locate these items or suitable 
replacements?
&gt;
Not to bring up a bad name, but JC Whitney sells a pump that fits 
in the original location, and has done just fine for me, plus a 
faucet/switch combo, for about $30 or so for everything, as I 
recall.  I've seen what appears to be the identical package at RV 
supply stores (generally for more money).  My only complaint was 
that the water pressure was just a bit too high (splashed out of 
the sink).  I constricted the outgoing water line with a hose 
clamp.  Feared this might overheat the pump, but it lasted the 
whole camping season without a problem.  For about $20 for the pump 
alone (I didn't buy the faucet/switch), I think I got my moneys 
worth already.&gt;


&gt;
&gt;        Future plans...Put in a gas stove, maybe have the Propane 
tank
&gt;under the stove where the spare tire is normally kept, and gas 
heater. Any
&gt;problems there?       Also would like to hook up another Marine 
type
&gt;battery in the back, with an Inverter and Isolater. 
&gt;
&gt;I've done the stove, the 2nd battery/isolator, and the gas heater 
(BA6) in my '77 Westy.  Let me know if you have any questions.
&gt;
