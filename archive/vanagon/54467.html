Subject: Friday!

How about some&quot;I can't believe I .....&quot; in or to my vanagon?!

1.  I can't believe I tried to kick snow off my mudflap when it was 5 
below zero!  (I now have a nice three inch tear in the flap).

2.  I can't believe I didn't check my brake fluid before I left on the 
three hundred mile trip!  (Especially when I knew I had a leak!)

3.  I can't believe I backed out of my garage with the roof vent propped 
open.  (That was a $165 mistake!)
