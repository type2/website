Subject: About CV Joints

If you remove a joint from the driveshaft, can you just mount it back on 
the splines, or do you have to &quot;line it up&quot; against the other joint??
Should you mark the axle and the joint before disassemble? 

On joints that are not constant velocity, this is very nessecary to 
avoid vibrations in the axle. Like old rear wheel driven vehicles.
