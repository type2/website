Subject: Re: FTP via Mosaic

/can this stuff be accessed through mosaic, I don't think I have and gopher
/stuff, I am working on a sun station.

Sure can. Just open a URL to gopher://[ftp.site.name]/[directory]
(eliminate the square brackets)

Vanagon is
	 gopher://halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu/Miscellaneous/Vanagon

This is the way that I do it. My Mosaic is faster than my Gopher.
