Howdy!

	Tonight I put in a little time on the bus, and even got the SO to
pitch in!

	Amy worked on doing the filling on the new rocker panel after I ground
the welds down.  She's quite good at the bondo-thing, and quite consertative
at it as well.

	We also put the driver's window back in, after a frantic search thru the
entire house for some string.  I ended up using a strip of RJ11 instead.  I
still worked, but I couldn't loop it back over properly, so it took a little
bit of persuasion to get the last 3&quot; in (Doesn't it always! :) 

	Putting in these windows is definitely a 2-person job!

	I then started on the passenger side rocker panel.  This one looked 
almost OK from the outside, but was actually rused worse on the inside!  The
inside of the rocker panel under the cargo doors is just plain, bare metal!
No wonder they rust out in only 35 years! Geeeez!

	Also, a word on replacement panels.  I bought the out rockers from
Wolfsburg West, and I need to point out a couple of things.  First, Its
gonna take some fiddling to get them to fit right, and second, on the
cargo side rockers, the catalog is misleading.  It says &quot;includes inner rocker&quot;
but in real life it doesn't.   You still will need to put in a complete inner 
rocker, if the old one is rusty, and not just the section beneath the doors.
What they meand was the rocker pice for under the doors has a piece welded
to it, like the factory one, but that has to do with reinforcing the
door, and not being the inner rocker.  The other lame thing about WW is
they don't actually have the inner rockers, so you have to go somewhere else,
like RMMW ($38) or Das Bulli Haus ($23).  You decide!

	Well, Sunday is Guibo day for the BMW, so I don't know if I'll get to 
the bus or not :(

	Also, if any of you end up involved doing any of this stuff I've been
doing for mine, gimme a holler and I can prolly give pointers (++(*p))
