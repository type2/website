Subject: 71 Westy Correct Exterior Color/Tent

I have heard that the 1971 Westy came in only one color,red. Is this true
or were there other color combinations? Someone goofed mine up with
another non-VW red color. What was the correct factory red in 1971? I
hope to correct the color problem sometime in the future.
Also does anyone have a factory diagram picture with any instructions to
set up a factory tent? I have a tent, and all the parts seem to be there,
but I have never seen one, erect, in person or in a picture. Any do's or
don'ts to avoid any problems with wind, connection to the drip
rail,stress points etc.? I can figure it out, but a picture is worth a
1000 hours of frustration.
Thanks for any help anyone may be able to provide.
