&gt;
&gt;Ok Folks,
&gt;
&gt;  My son (13) had a hissy fit last night about NuBus ('82 Diesel).
&gt;These were some of his quotes:
&gt;
&gt;So, am I alone with this? Any net.experience on remoulding
&gt;recalcitrant posterity?

   No problem, just lash him to the front grill and drive him to school in 
the AM. When you untie him point out how much more uncomfortable it would 
have been to be tied that tightly to a puny Chevy Lumina APV.   tim s.
