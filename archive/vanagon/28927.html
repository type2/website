&gt; 
&gt; yes, they do keep a database, and if you write them, they will check to see
&gt; if your bus has had the recalls applied.

There is also a toll-free number for VOA that one can *call* and they
will check the various 'campaigns' of recall that your bus has
undergone, meaning they will tell you if the work has been
performed.  You must have your VIN when you call.  and of course, the 
phone number is at home, not where i am now (where ever the heck that 
is).  if my feeble brain remembers, i'll post it tomorrow.  others 
probably have the number at hand.
