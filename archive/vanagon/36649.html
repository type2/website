&gt;I have an 86 syncro that fails the emission testing.  There is too much CO2.
&gt;
&gt;Took it to one of the acredited repair shops listed on the paperwork.  They 
&gt;informed my wife that there was a bad injector.  
&gt;Questions:
&gt;1, Are the injectors different on the digifant than the digijet?
&gt;2, If one is bad should I replace all 4?
&gt;3, Napa sez they can get em for around $60(Bosch)?
&gt;4, Rebuilds are about $40 are they as good as new?
&gt;5, What is the difference between digfant and digijet?
&gt;
&gt;I am still gather information on my previous quest(vibration and lurch).
&gt;I will look at information then so what happens.  I will summarize and send 
&gt;and update to the list.  I am so fed with all these problems I went out and 
&gt;put $5000 down on one of them thar new Concept II vans.

How did they determine an injector was bad???  I doubt it.  What is the HC
level?  Was the engine proerly warmed up?  Idling engine to warm up will
often load up CAT to cause failure.  O2 sensor is probably the problem.
 Injectors can be changed singularly.  Do not mix digijet with dijifant
control system.  Dijifant has improved idle control,(throttle bypas vs
ignition timing),  ignition timing and coil control provided by brain, not
separate module.  # wire O2 sensor,(heated for faster response).  Digifant
more susceptible to erratic behavior from bad sensors/grounds
