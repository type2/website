Subject: Help On Intelligent Gopher Searches

Gerry pointed out an important functionality of the gopher search engine
which I didn't know existed so I thought it should be forwarded to the list.

&gt;&gt; These new Alta Vista products allow you to search your own hard drive the
&gt;&gt; way Alta Vista allows you to search the web--with complicated search queries
&gt;&gt; like, (&quot;Syncro&quot; AND NOT &quot;SYNCROHEAD_at_AOL.COM&quot;), a search which I don't think
&gt;&gt; I can do on the gopher server. (That guy messes up our syncro searches!) :-)

Gerry's response: 

Try this at the gopher search prompt
syncro and shocks not syncrohead  

Derek's new query:

Wow! Tell us, Gerry, where to get help instructions for the search query
language for the gopher searcher.
