I have the same wheels on my Notchback. It cost me $100.00 each to have them
fully polished. Basically, the metal shop had to grind down the anodized areas,
and buff them out. If the wheels you have are not repro, you will need some xtra
long lug bolts or studs. I made studs for mine by using Kubota diesel tractor
cylinder head bolts,and cutting off the hex end. Got the lug nuts and the center
caps from Barret Enterprises. They look way cool.

Thus spake Tom (formerly wealthy) Carrington.

Lemme see ~$200-$400 for the wheels themselves and $400 for the polishing.

That's a fair chunk of change for a shoes for a decrepit 30yr-old notchback.

Oh, you wanted TIRES too?

Who said used cars are cheap?
