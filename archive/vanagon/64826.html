Subject:      Syncro Owner's Manual/Shop Manual

I recently acquired an 86 Vanagon GL Syncro and love it already (where
have you been all my life?).  Took the family on a 1000+ mile trip in
the high sierras, and it performed flawlessly. Up and over Ebbetts
Pass - almost 9000ft - with a steep, exciting descent on the Eastern
Very gratifying!!
I managed to get a regular Vanagon owner's manual from the CA VW
distributor, but he claims there is no manual or supplement specific
to the Syncro.  This can't be true.  Please help if you know where I
can find one - in English please.
Also, can anyone recommend a shop manual - and tell me where to find
it?
