From: Gerald Skerbitz &lt;gsker_at_lenti&gt;
Subject: Wanted: Transmission for 1988 T3

He's in the UK now, but I don't know if the car is in Norway or not.

Message by Espen Lyngaas (espen_at_team17_dot_com) follows.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Sirs, I've contacted Tim Smith (smitht_at_unb_dot_ca) regarding a 5 speed
manual gear box for the 'VW Transporter' (or Vanagon, as the americans call it)

He suggested that I'd contact you. The message from Mr. Smith was:

&quot;Post your message to vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu  for a try at it.  We have a
Swiss member with a good used parts dismantler.&quot;

The van is a VW Transporter 1988 model, with the 112hp DigiJet engine. If
you could get hold of a gearbox for this van, please quote me the price.
Though your parts are probably high quality checked items, I'm really
looking for a gearbox that's cheap - I intend to sell the car as soon as the
new gearbox is installed.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
