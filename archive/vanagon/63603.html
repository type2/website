Have you taken a voltage reading before and after the occurrence of the
charging light?
Just curious

&gt;I've got an '84 vanagon that's got an electrical charging problem.  
&gt;The
&gt;charge idiot light comes on after about 15 minutes of driving (OK when
&gt;cold).  Thought it was the voltage regulator... replaced it, no good.
&gt;
&gt;Is the alternator going bad?  Where to find one?
&gt;
