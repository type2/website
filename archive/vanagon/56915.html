'80 Westi, '80 Westi Kids Playhouse
The Playhouse is in good body shape, 
and if someone desires to customize interior, it's an ideal candidate, 
available cheap.  Let's talk &amp; I'll detail condition.

Still a late loaf fixed hightop camper AS&amp;R candidate out there, if 
anyone is interested.  Seen it languishing, have not talked to owner.
