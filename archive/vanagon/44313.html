Subject: SF Bay Area Garages/Bat Signal

A couple of weeks ago I asked the list for leads on good reliable garages in
the San Francisco Bay area. I got some tips (thanks!), and now it's down to
two places: Atlas Motors in SF and Gandalf's (recommended by a list member)
in South SF. Before I plunk down big $$ for a front end overhaul plus other
stuff, anyone have any scuttlebutt on these garages? Thanks again.

On a lighter note, &lt;brandys_at_ichips.intel_dot_com&gt; wrote:

&gt;I tried to explain to him that whenever VW busses turn on their hazard
&gt;lights, a huge karmic VW symbol is projected from the roof into the
&gt;sky, notifying all other buses in the area one of their bretheren
&gt;needs help, just like the BAT SIGNAL.

Last time I broke down, a guy in a *Jaguar* stopped to get out and help push
the beast. Used to have a VW, he said.
