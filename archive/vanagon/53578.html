I have a collection of VW busses that I would like to sell to someone that
would
appreciate them more than myself. All are priced to go so I don't have to
pay 
storage on them any more. Prices are as follows.

Busses are in Portland Oregon!

1. 1962 Bus 15 window (just a shell, rolling but no motor or glass and
trim)
This bus has only a fair amount of rust but needs a lot, although it could
be restored if someone had a van that did not have a good body and had all
the parts to put on this one. Or it could be used for parts. 
asking price is $250

2. 1965 Bus walk thru type complete but does not run (engine out) minor
rust
but very repairable. Blue and White! Missing a few parts but mostly there!
asking price is $750

3. 1967 Bus Camper with pop up top. totaly complete minus VW emblem in
front.
Has rust in rockers and drivers floor panel but repairable. Camper kit is
all in tack
but bus needs total restoration. (runs but knocks).
asking price is $800

Will sell all or might consider parting out if there is no other
alternative.

If interested please e-mail me at GhiaConv_at_aol_dot_com
