&gt; IS THERE ANY INTEREST IN AN EASTERN LEG?
&gt; 
Iagree, that we should all try to meet in St. Louis, and then go
traipsing about the east coast. Perhaps if we could all get together and
figure something out. I for one can suggest perhaps driving/camping the
Blue Ridge Parkway, or perhaps the Outer Banks...
