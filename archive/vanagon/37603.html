Subject: RE: re 'so much love'+dysfunctional emotional attachment...


&gt;&gt; &gt;Sounds to me like a typical marriage....but then again, most people 
don't
&gt;&gt; &gt;marry their vehicles, do they?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Most don't. But, then, those that do, usually wind up joining mailing 
lists
&gt;&gt; for the cars, too.   :^)
&gt;
&gt;Grin.
&gt;
&gt;So Steve, are you expecting any off-spring?  Say a Bug with a
&gt;Chevette Engine?!


Well, I recently put a small radio-control set into one of those 4-foot-
wingspan styrofoam gliders you can get at Target. It even flew. An electric
motor is next.

That qualify?

:^)
