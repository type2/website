  There *is* a safety inspection in CA.  Vehicles that have been salvaged
from a total loss must be inspected to assure that they are roadworthy.

  I went to the DMV last year for registration renewal.  The DMV worker
said that since the vehicle was salvaged (in 1987) I had to get the car
inspected and re-registered.  I asked why this was not called to my attn
years ago.  I had no problem renewing the registration over the years.
They took my money and gave me a little sticker for the tags. DMV had no 
answer to my question and asked me to comply to get my tags.

DMV requested the following:
1. VIN verification certificate. (no fee)
2. Brake and lamp inspection certificate. ($90)
3. Smog certificate. ($25)
4. Surrender the current license plates. (original blue/gold)

  The most difficult hurdle was to pass the brake and lamp inspection.
The inspector failed me the first time for 'crazed' lenses on the front
turn signal lamps and H4 halogen headlights.  I pointed out that the rear
lenses had cracks at the mouting holes.  &quot;That's probably ok.&quot; he said. 
I replaced the H4s with cheap stock headlights for the next inspection.
  I searched around for some front lenses that had no cracks.  No new
parts could be found.  The inspector found some on the east coast at
$50 each.  I went back for another inspection, paid for the parts and
the inspection certificate.  The inspector installed the lenses for no
charge, but to my disgust the SOB overtightened the screws and cracked
them both.  I raised hell.   Stay away from C&amp;F motors in Costa Mesa.  

  Back at the DMV they said that I would have to surrender the old license
plates and be issued a new license plate number.  &quot;It's like starting
over from scratch&quot; the DMV worker told me.  They also collected $5 in order
to maintain the vehicle's prior history.  ?!
  My registration fee went from $35/year to $51/year and I had to spend
over $200 in fees and parts.  I could hear the cash registers ringing all 
the way from Sacramento.
