Gerry asked:
&gt;I have a problem now, however, 
&gt;because the tires I just bought have a max of 50 lbs, and the recommended 
&gt;is 48.  Is that cutting it close, or is it ok?  With bicycle tires, I 
&gt;could always inflate to exactly the maximum pressure and it'd be fine. Is 
&gt;this true of Automobile tires also?

I have the reinforced XZX and their MAX is 40 psi. This also happens to be
the pressure recommended by VW for the back. And they *did* have those
tires in mind when they made this recommendation. So I would guess that
this is still safe. 

Something else: VW also recommends 30 psi for the front tires. Again, this
recommendation is for those very tires. But that seemed to be too low to
the tire store guy and so he put 35 psi. Any comments/protests?
