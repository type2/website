&gt;DOH!
&gt;(snip)
&gt;Were the CVs replaced or just repacked? Mine were pretty worn.

Neither, so don't feel so bad, Jim! This was strictly a &quot;get me (safely) 
home to Washington DC&quot; (really, Steve) measure.  

Here is a more complete version of our CV story, again, from the archives:

QUOTE
August 25. Using the local map, found a tiny two track road, through 
gorgeous giant trees, down from Sequoia leaving us in the foothills 
northeast of Visalia. Lunch at a great mexican restaurant, reprovision at 
the most outrageous Walmart ever seen (includes a McDonalds inside the 
store, turns out the town is also the site of a major Walmart distribution 
center, and this is sort of a test location) in Porterville, and then 
headed east toward a route across the mountains shown in our local map, 
but not on the Rand McNally map of California. Climbing up a pass at slow 
speed, heard a very faint knocking, but it disappears before we can 
identify it. Spent the night on the Kern River, in a beautiful high desert 
campsite. 

August 26: (snip)  After numerous climbs, we reach Death Valley, where it 
was 106 in the shade. Clearly, the Vanagon Syncro cooling system is up to 
the task, which includes keeping us in the A/C on all but the longest 
climbs. I do not like the lack of numerical data from that water temp 
guage, so whenever the cooling fan goes on full, the A/C goes off. 

Climbing out of Death Valley, at the aforementioned air temperature, the 
aforementioned knocking returns.  I stick my head out the window; its 
coming from the drivers side front wheel area. I try to not think about CV 
joints, much less mention the possibility. 

My six year old son says &quot;What's that noise?&quot; indicating to me that it is 
no longer so faint. 

My wife recalls hearing a noise like that in Africa, when she was driving 
a Citroen 2CV pickup truck. &quot;I can't remember what they  called it, some 
sort of axle-arm thing, but it was expensive...&quot;. 

&quot;How about 'CV', or 'constant velocity joint'?&quot; I ask, allowing myself to 
actually mouth the dreaded words. 

&quot;Well, that was Cameroon, French speaking.&quot; No doubt remembering the 
article on Syncros she translated from German earlier this year, she 
finishes &quot; Automotive terms don't seem to translate easily or  directly.&quot;

I have slowed down a tad; the sound gets fainter, and then disappears.

We arrive safely in Las Vegas a few hours later, and install ourselves at 
the local KOA. Our camping area neighbors include a young German couple in 
a Mercedes Benz Gelandewagen (a very high dollar SUV) with German plates, 
he comes over to say hi and mentions that our cars were built at the same 
factory.

I call Joel, get his surly answering machine, and leave a message. I call 
hourly, and the line is busy. Finally, at 11:50 east coast time, he 
answers. After a long and interesting discussion, including vocal 
imitations of sound effects made by bearings and CV joints in various 
forms of distress far superior to anything done by Tom and Ray of Car 
Talk, he concludes: &quot;Get a place that has the tool to inject grease 
between the axle and the boot, add 6 or 8 oz, and you'll be OK till you 
get home...&quot;.

August 27: I spent part of Sunday going around/calling around the various 
Las Vegas auto repair places that advertise &quot;Open Sunday&quot;, getting no 
knowledgable responses for my request to inject grease into the CV.  
Looked in the Yellow pages for VW and Porsche specialists and found one 
called the Beetle Barn, open at 7:30 M-F.

Spent the afternoon at &quot;The Strip&quot;, mostly at the Luxor pyramid, which has 
much more of a family orientation than we had expected. Everyone had a 
pleasant afternoon and evening.

August 28: Top off the water, fuel and propane, and head over to the 
Beetle Barn.  This is a GREAT place, a combo junkyard/shop/used car sales, 
all VW. About 2 acres of dry country cars...they knew exactly what I was 
asking for, did all the CVs and had us out of the super clean shop in 1/2 
an hour, and the total bill was about $21.00.  Did not hear the slightest 
bump for the rest of the trip.
UNQUOTE

The only thing to add was that Joel made me *swear* on a stack
of lenti servers that I would remove, inspect and  repack the CVs next 
summer. Its on the schedule.
