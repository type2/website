&gt; I think you could get some argument from people on this list on this.
&gt; The engines were actually very strong and dependable compared to the
&gt; older Type I engine.   
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 		Not many....that's why I also own one. But, again, I'm not
&gt; &gt; 		so sure I would if there had been some competition internal
&gt; &gt; 		to the US. Our campers aren't perfect. I think they're way
&gt; &gt; 		too noisy inside; the A/C ducting is assinine as they shoulda
&gt; &gt; 		used the ducting that goes to the dash;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
&gt;                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; You sure got that right.
&gt; 
&gt; 	       no graywater sump.
&gt; &gt; 		But, yes, considering the lack of competition in the near-full-
&gt; &gt; 		service-camper, car-size, pop-top camper market, it's the best
&gt; &gt; 		on the road.
&gt; 
&gt; My sentiment exactly.
&gt; 
&gt; What were we arguing about?  ;)
&gt; 

	Debating, maybe.....

	I was first responding to what I perceived to be intense dislike
	of statements made on what I consider to be a comedy radio show. But,
	I know I'm sensitive to what I perceive to be elitism in folks. Working
	in the computer biz, I've grown weary of the emotional attachments
	folks develop to &quot;things&quot; and that also applies to vehicles. While I
	share Ric's frustration with the effect on the market by those average
	drivers, I guess I'm less interested as I get older to reject others
	values that don't match mine, meaning I don't take alot of this stuff
	as seriously as I used to. Probably part of some old fart syndrome.

	Stuart R.
