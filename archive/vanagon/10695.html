&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;One drawback to the full Westy vs the Weekender is the lack of 
&gt; &gt;seating.  Does anyone have the single accessory seat that mounted 
&gt; &gt;behind the front passenger seat for Vanagon Westys?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 

  What about using one of the backward-facing-folding-up ones that were in
  the Wolfsburg Edition Vanagons? Or would that get in the way of the 
  swivelling fron passenger seat?
