&gt;Beats the 1970 Bug my old man gave me!  Nice of him to help you out like that.
&gt; If I visit him will you buy that '91 Syncro I've yearning for?   Maybe Mr.
&gt;Garcia had something do with it......karma and all.

  A 1970? How lucky can one get? I got a 1965 and had to push it to start!
Being a student, I could push but not buy the starter that it needed.
