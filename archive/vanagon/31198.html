Gee, after Tim Smith savaged my new EV Winnebago, (see
clipping below), am I allowed to boast that I can check
the propane level automatically from the LED panel?
(Presumably while making coffee at 100 kph on cruise
control?)

&gt; Westie Propane Gauge?
&gt; Has anyone figured out a good gauge system for determining 
how much propane is in the tank?

&gt;Storage space sucked, same good rear corner locker, but 
&gt;under bench about 8&quot;
&gt;deep and not full width, rear area taken up by battery(s) 
&gt;and furnace
&gt;(Suburban brand, propane), small suitcase cubby hole 16&quot; 
&gt;wide in middle.
&gt;Rear mattress pad was say 1.5&quot; thick, groan.  They get 
&gt;thinner every model
&gt;change, loafs 4-5&quot;, vanagon 3-4&quot;, eurvan 1-2&quot;, (sorry 
&gt;splitties, never owned
&gt;one, yet!)
&gt;         Nice fridge, Norcold, big! At least the door was, 
&gt;I couldn't open
&gt;it, or much of the kitchen since the double middle seat was 
&gt;firmly against
&gt;it.  There is NO WAY anyone even mildly portly is getting 
&gt;into the rear
&gt;bench with that sucker in either.  Had H2O/grey water 
&gt;tanks. There is no
&gt;rear window on drivers side, badly claustrophobic (fear of 
&gt;santas) once I
&gt;had wedged myself into the back seat, shedding donut crumbs 
&gt;and grunting.
&gt;Surrounded by a uniform haze of muted gray colours, in 
&gt;pebble textured
&gt;plastic, natch. A Prozac experience?  And the curtains... 
&gt;plastic accordian
&gt;pulldowns, this van badly needs some wood/cloth trim, mind 
&gt;you baby puke
&gt;will wipe off easily.
&gt;         So, what did I like about it?  Well it's no 
&gt;Vanagon, felt cramped
&gt;overall, but the big triangular side windows in the pop-top 
&gt;are back!  Yes,
&gt;that's all folks, liked the side windows, miss'em in my 
&gt;vanagon.  $38K-Cdn
&gt;base, $42K as equipped, Oh, plus 18.7% taxes, let's call it 
&gt;$50 grand.  The
&gt;regional rep wasn't happy when I said I could buy 4 
&gt;excellent used Westy
&gt;vanagons for that money and never need to buy another VW in 
&gt;my life.
