Subject:      Re: VW EuroVan chassis &quot;Rialta&quot;

I priced one out back in June.  Had no problem getting the dealer down to $46k
fully equipped.  Including generator, TV, and the Microwave.  The low ground
clearance of the water pipe is a problem in most RV's.  With a little care, it
wont be a problem.  Personally,  I think this is a much better deal for the
money than the Eurovan Camper.  Consider also that is insured as an RV, not a
car.  You can also finance it for 15 years and the interest is tax deductible.
 The bad part is that for a little more money you can have a full size RV with
a freezer that keeps ice cream.  Some of these Class &quot;C&quot;s start at 21 feet
which is the same length as the Rialta.  Major problem with these is lack of
Fuel economy and in New York, they can not be driven on parkways.  Since I
needed a tow vehicle,  I opted for a used 27 foot Tioga.  Sleeps 6, seats 8.
460 cubic inches and 10 mpg.  I got a 92 with 36K on it.  Paid $22K.  Has
everything including the generator and boy is it fun to live in.  However, I
will not part with my Syncro Camper as it is to much fun to drive and bring to
shows.
