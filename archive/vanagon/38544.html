&gt;     I've got an 85 Westy, and I'm curious if anyone's every cut out
&gt;     the 'luggage rack' and installed a sunroof on one of these. I
&gt;     don't need the extra space, and it would make summer driving a
&gt;     hell of a lot better (no AC). Does this make any sense or is
&gt;     there some problem that I'm overlooking?
&gt; 
&gt; Interesting idea... Having just removed the 'rack' to replace the 
&gt; seal, I can comment on a few snags: Assuming you'd be cutting the 
&gt; shelf area out to make a hole - you'd need to extend the fiberglass 
&gt; sides of the shelf area down to meet the roof. The shelf sits about 
&gt; 2&quot; above the metal of the roof. Also, having the sunroof sunken into 
&gt; the rack area may produce some weird turbulence at highway speeds. 


You don't need to extend the cut lips down to meet the roof. The 
turbulence is minor, infact your hair is drawn up and out of the sunroof.



&gt; 
&gt; An interesting project would be to place the glass flush with the top surface
&gt; of the rack, then devise a way of sealing the opening in the roof and
&gt; the joint between roof/rack - effectively adding 6&quot; of headroom to
&gt; the cab area... 

Now thats a thought! Beehive hairdo's live again!
