&gt; Vanagon's came in flavors?  Wow, somehow I missed this feature.  Does it
&gt; come in chocolate too?  I'm going back to my dealer and demand to know

I would seriously consider buying one  in a few years. Several things would
convince me: superior safety record over vanilla van; ability to a handle
arctic like weather (hey Ottawa is the 2nd coldest capital in the world
next to Ulaan Batur); reliable and inexpensive to repair.

Before then i shall stay close to my IVORY-Vanilla 82. DC
