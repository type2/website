Subject: Bumper rubbers?


	Hi All :
I've just sandblasted and primed my bumpers, but before I reassemble them,
I'd like to try and find some replacement rubbers (the up and down type)
for them. The old ones, which have three implanted bolts, were too
corroded to save, and I'll only be able to use them if I can find nothing
else... My bus is a '72 by the way. Neither Parts Place, not West Coast
Metric has them available. Does anyone know of a source???
