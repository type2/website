Hi all,

	a couple of weeks ago I bought my first car ever, a '71 bus, and in very
	good condition for a low price. I drove the bus home from Switzerland to
	the Netherlands (over 1300km) without any significant problems.
	The weekend after I got home, I wanted to take the bus out for a drive
	to the coast. Unforunately, I never got there. Along the way, the
	engine got busted.
	My dad and me have spent a couple of days taking the engine out and
	apart and have found that one piston has broken and/or melted, damaging
	a lot of other internal parts (and another piston).
	Our first thought was that I had killed the engine by driving to fast
	(my speed was a costant 110km/h, flat road). Our second thought is that
	one of the sparkplugs may have been too long.
	It is not very important anymore, but does anyone have any ideas as to
	what may have caused this tragedy ?  The only extra information I can
	give is that, when I drove away from my house that morning, the engine
	didn't deliver enough power to get the car moving at a decent speed.
	I solved this by briefly flooring the gas-pedal.

	I am now searching for a replacement engine case, but am getting a
	little confused.
	Most of the shops say that I can't use a beetle engine, because it
	does not have the same mounting points as a bus case.
	Yesterday I talked to a bus owner, and he said that this isn't true
	and I can use a beetle engine without any problems.
	If there was an ample supply of bus parts (and engines) this woud
	ofcoure not be a problem. But bus parts are very hard to find over
	here.
	Can anyone please say if I can use a beetle engine without modification.
	Or, if not, what modifications have to be made ?
