Subject:  RE: Inuvik Mead request

huh, let me get this straight. you are going to give someone a bunch of booze 
to drive up past the arctic circle and drink?

driving to Inuvik is a fairly popular thing to do here (whitehorse, yukon).
many summer transients, (mostly university punks) make the trek...
six hour drive up to Dawson City, then around ten hours to inuvik up
the dempster highway. that is, if the ice bridge or ferry is in operation
(there is a time when the ice bridge is breaking up, but the ferry can't run
 because of the ice, when you can't make it to Iunvik by road)

a guy from work here drove to a point just past the arctic circle, then he
had to turn around because of a white out. he got two flat tires turning
around, hiked 25km back to the arctic circle, and waited five hours in 
an outhouse for another car to come along and drive them to a gas station...
the dempster highway is VERY hard on tires, it is surfaced with loose 
shale like stuff, and it cuts up tires very nicely. when the guy from work
turned around, doing the back and forth thing, some of the pieces of
shale turned upright, and cut the tires.
(he was driving a pathfinder, not a vw)

nothern lights...kinda a fall/late winter thing...no nothern lights in the summer,
or at least you can't see them in the summer, since it doesn't get dark at night.
