Subject: Bad Speedometers

A few months ago there was thread about the little plastic gear that 
wears out on vans.  I just had a new engine installed, and I really don't 
want to miss my 600 servicing.  Is there a part number associated with 
this piece?  Or is there another outlet for this.  I seem to remember 
someone here knew of a place where you could buy them.

                          
                               Later,
                                    Brad
