Subject: re : Cargo Hauls #6 at gas station

speaking of collateral to come back to pay for gas...

I used to have a 59 bus I drove around and one time I went down to the local
Chevron for 5 bucks of gas.  Unfortunately I found out I didn't have a cent
on me (doh!) So I left my friend Marc as collateral while I went home to get
the dough.  He said  they kept looking at him funny.   I wonder if they were
thinking of selling him for five bucks.
