&gt; Hello everybody,
&gt;         I just had a VW rebuilt engine put into my '86 Westfalia by a
&gt; local shop.  The mechanics at this shop used to work for the VW dealer but
&gt; defected.  Anyway, the engine transplant was completed on Saturday.
&gt; Sunday afternoon I went to take a look at it and noticed what seemed to be
&gt; a coolant leak coming from the passenger side head!  I started the van and
&gt; went to go put gas in it.  At the gas station, 1 block away, I noticed
&gt; that it was in fact leaking.  I had been hoping up 'til this point that
&gt; mabye it was spilled or something.  So I drove it back to the shop and
&gt; looked again.  It was really leaking pretty bad, much worse than the
&gt; leaking coolant I had on the old engine.  It also was not just coolant but
&gt; oil too?!  Yes, definatly greenish brown.
&gt;         This is very upsetting to me.  I'm going to be paying off credit
&gt; cards for some time and my car seems to be in worse shape?  Has anyone had
&gt; any experience with this?  I think that the Factory rebuilds have a 1-year
&gt; warranty, but I cannot afford labor.  I trust VWoA about as far as I can
&gt; throw them, and I can just see them saying that since they didn't install
&gt; it it's not their problem, or that I have to pay labor etc.  I'm going in
&gt; to see the mechanics tomarrow morning to see what they say.
&gt;         Part of the reason that I invested in this &quot;new&quot; engine was for
&gt; reliability reasons...so much for that theory.  That Subaru engine keeps
&gt; looking better and better.  Oh well, any comments greatly appreciated.

Cory,

Go back to the one who did the work and ask him to stand by his work. 
If that doesn't work, call your credit card company and ask them not to
pay.  You will have to write letters to the credit co., make sure you
keep copies.

A good mechanic will stand by their rebuild for at least the first 100
miles.

Be nice but be ready to be mean.
