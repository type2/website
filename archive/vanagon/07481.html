Subject: NEW Micro-bus WWW server !!!

     Ok you guys, it's time to let you loose on my WWW server.
     
     Fact is it's running on a 486DX2-66 PC so it might be a bit hesitant, 
     but give it a try and tell me what happens.
     
     The URL is:
     
           http://146.87.136.48/homepage.html
     
     I know it works from over here and I have had a friend connect from 
     over there ok.
     
     If you don't get any response try &quot;pinging&quot; it to see if it's alive.
     
     Well I'm gonna leave it running over the weekend so try not to break 
     it for me when I get back on Monday, please.
     
     Lee.
