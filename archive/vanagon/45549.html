Subject: Re: First breaker-bar of the summer!!!

&gt;I got up, the socket was still sitting on the axle nut as though this
entire event &gt;hadn't occurred.  Looking around, I retrieved the breaker-bar
from under the
&gt;bus... Yes Volks, the driver nib was still in the socket...sheared
&gt;clean off as though someone had cut it.  Determined not to let this
&gt;little set back ruin an otherwise &quot;good&quot; day, I immediately found an
&gt;optimistic angle to the situation: &quot;Hey, not everyone has sheared off
&gt;a 3/4&quot; drive breaker-bar...especially without using a length of pipe.&quot;


Nice work!  I've got two broken bars I leave sitting around, just to remind
myself what fun a bus is.  The cheap ratchet one looks like a really mean
medieval weapon, with it's curved, broken, splined head.

After my third bar, I ended up taking the swivel head bar (broken) to a
welder and had them put a full bead around the head with a bolt through the
middle.  Hasn't broken since, and has removed many rear axle nuts, with a 4'
long heavy square steel extension.   It also does gland nuts that are
solidly green-locktighted in place with ease, once the engine is held down
properly.
