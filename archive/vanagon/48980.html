Subject: Different Vanagon Radiator ???

Hi folks, a Christmas wish a bit early

Has anyone seen/heard of a vanagon compatible radiator with a cap up front
like a 'real' car??  Our vanagons are all getting old and replacement rads
will be in demand soon in larger numbers. The majority of cooling problems
in vanagons would disappear if we check the level of coolant in the rad, no
hidden airbubbles, no friggin' bleeding.  Just 4 screws to twist out and
remove the grill, then the cap.  Still not as good as a car, but way better
than a vanagon.  Perhaps a little trap door in the grill even! Kennedy
Engineered Products uses a front fill rad in their Subaru test van, an '85.
What about the Mexi or Brasil watercooled busses?  Put your ears on,
complain loudly to radiator sales folks, let's get a very simple
modification suggested to the right people.  Just wishing.  Tim Smith
