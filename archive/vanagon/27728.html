Howdy, y'all!

Can anyone give me an idea what's happening: '72 Westy. Only driven
occasionally since summer, when transmission was pulled, rebuilt and
re-installed. Brakes had been squealing--high pitched sound. Brake pedal
developed a &quot;kink.&quot; While depressing for the first 1-2 inches, it seems to
move, but &quot;stick.&quot; ALmost like one of the calipers is stuck, then gives.

It requires more force to push the pedal down, then seems to brake
sufficiently until the next time I have to use it, when the sticking thing
happens again.

A note: the vacuum hose to master cylinder is plugged off, and the brakes
could be considered in more of a manual mode. Brakes have been like this
for about five years, when last I replaced them all.

Questions:
What is happening and why?
How to fix?
Dangerous to drive now? Will brakes suddenly fail?


Thanks.

Louise
