Subject: RE: 911 motor in a VW transporter


&gt;that if someone leaves a good 3.0 liter engine in my driveway some far-off
&gt;day, I can swap the 2.7 and the bigger one in about 3 hours.

I missed the start of this thread.  What does one use to mate the engine to
the VW transaxle?  Wouldn't the added horsepower beat up on a stock trans?
