Mike,

I second Norman's thoughts on carrying bikes in the EV.  To me the van is=

just too high to use a roof rack.  I can stick a road bike or folded
trailer behind the rear seat and often times pull the jump seats out and
put a bike on the floor.  I plan on making some type of frame with  bike
tight fork mounts for the floor so I could sit up a few bikes in the floo=
r
area.  I've yet to figure how to put a tandem in the EV but it might be
possible with the rear seat folded.  (So much for seating 5 though).  I'v=
e
got the $225 Yakima tandem mount for my roof rack that I usually just use=

on the Fox.  My son is 2 1/2 so my biking isn't up to the level that it
once was anyway.
