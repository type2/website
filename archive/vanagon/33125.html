Subject: 86' GL stalling
Date: Thu, 18 Jan 1996 11:18:16 -0500 (EST)

hello-
I have an 86' GL that is having some strange problems.  All was
well until the fuel pump went.  Since then I have begun to
develop a problem.  After replacement of the fuel pump i
ventured out towards virginia and 400 miles later i broke
down.  I was going slow at the time and the engine sputtered
and stalled.  fortunately i was able to coast into a rest stop.
	after about 30 minutes and a mind full of worry i went
to assess the problem.  Nothing was obvious, so i tried to
start it , and it started right, running very smoothly.
Unfortunately, i was fooled by this apparent miracle and about
60 miles later the same thing happend.  Again it started back
up after only a short time sitting.  
	Now in west virginia and no van parts in sight, i was
forced to replace my fuel filter again (despearte attempt) w/ a
napa filter for some other type of car. Fortunately, it worked
and worked well (pressure was fine at idle and prolonged high
rpm) and i made it back to virginia.  I am still having the
same problems now, even though i now have the correct filter
on.  
questions:  The only times i have driven the van since
returning has been in wet, snowy weather.  The stalling
occurrs, but it will start back up immediately.  -- Could there
be some wetness related short that i am overlooking??
Fuel injectors??
Could it be exhaust related (ie.  once the converter gets
heated could it be putting pressure back on the engine)??
Timing???
OXS related??  
help me if you can --  many thanks in advance
