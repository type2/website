&gt;As always and per spec, I set the timing at 5 atdc at idle. Unfortunately,
&gt;this causes advance to be about 42 btdc at 3,000 rpm, a bit much it seems. 
&gt;For the quick and cheap fix, should I readjust timing to 28 btdc at 3,000
&gt;rpm or leave as is?  For the more costly (time and money) fix, do I need a
&gt;new distributor? For the overkill fix: can I replace the distributor with 
&gt;one of those elctronic boxes they advertize in HotVWs?
&gt;
&gt;I did check Bentley, but got a bit confused: a table shows the
&gt;*centrifugal* timing range for my 022 905 205 AB distributor (2,000 rpm,
&gt;11-17 deg. -- 3,600, 21-25 deg.), but doesn't say whether the vacuum hoses
&gt;to the vacuum chamber unit should be disconnected or not. Anyone know?
&gt;
&gt;

For the first question, does it knock or ping? If so, you need to reduce the
advance by repalcing the distributer.  The electronic conversions will not
affect the timing if installed correctly.  That centifigul rating above is
only ofr the centrifigal part of the distributer.  The vacuum advance gets
added to it.
