Subject: Help on importing a Canadian EV Double Cab

I've recently been afflicted with &quot;gotta have an EV Double Cab&quot; fever and
have been exploring the importation of one from Canada into the States
and I'm looking for any information from anybody on the subject.
 
To date, I have contacted the EPA and their response was no problem.  All
1988 and up vehicles sold into Canada meet US Federal Emissions
standards.

Things have fallen apart though after contacting DOT. They
suggest contacting the manufacturer to determine what if any compliance
issues there are with a particular vehicle.  So I contacted VWofA and
they basically said &quot;no can do&quot; and recommended I contact an auto
importer.  BTW, I re-contacted DOT after VWofA brushed me off to see if
they were required to provide this information and the answer was no.

Next I contacted and importer and was told that since VW never offered
the EV Double Cab in the States they would have to go through an
exhaustive certification process which could cost $6,000-$10,000.

I'm sick but not that sick.

So if there is anyone out there with any experience in these matters, or
thoughts, comments or chicken soup, your input would be appreciated.
