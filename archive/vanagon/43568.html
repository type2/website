The tranny should be aluminum.  And the prefered method of making a 12V
flywheel fit is a grinder.  If magnesium did catch fire, nothing you have
at your house would put it out.  

&gt; it.  It should be fairly simple to build a 6V reglulated power supply using
&gt; a 723 regulator with an extra power transistor on the output to form a
&gt; Darlington pair with the 723 internal output transistor to boost the
&gt; amperage.  I'll build that after I get all the windows sealed up with new

I have a plan for using an LM317T and a 2N3055 to handle the wiper load (up
to 8 amps). I can forward to anyone that's interested.
