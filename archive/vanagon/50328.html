&gt; &gt; &gt; All in all, I was pleased with the service from VWofA, and considered their
&gt; &gt; &gt; offer fair, if not generous (considering the 93,000 miles on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; out-of-warranty van).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Has anyone recieved feedback from VW of Canada on this issue, either
&gt; &gt; positive or negative? I'd like to be prepared in advance...
&gt; 
&gt; Alas there is no VW of Canada any more, apart from a phone number.

I really don't understand this one - There is a *much* higher 
percentage of VWs on the road in Canda, new and old, than anywhere 
I've been in the US, yet VW doesn't seem to care. Older VWs have very 
high resale value here, maybe because loyal VW owners are afraid of 
buying a new VW with such crappy dealer/VW support. I bought 2 new 
VWs in 90/91, loved the cars, hated the dealer support, and have 
since sold them and bought 4 used VWs which have been much better, 
mainly since I don't take them to the dealer.
I still drop by the dealer, and hope to drive the Jetta TDI someday, 
but why pay $30K CDN for a new car which doesn't even have factory 
reps in the country anymore? I'll wait 3-4 yrs &amp; get one then. Same 
goes for the vans, although I don't even bother looking at the new 
ones at over 45K!
Wake up VW!
