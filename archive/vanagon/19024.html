Subject:       synthetic trans fluid notice

The following notice is from a cautionary tag on a transmission 
recently put into a '90 Vanagon at the local dealership.  I'll type 
it verbaitum and let y'all thrash it around as to what it means.

&quot;CAUTION! This trans should be filled with 75 or 80 weight SYNTHETIC 
GL-4 rated OIL.  We recommend Redline MT-90, or VW synthetic ( p.n. 
G005 000); this is what the factory uses.

If you do not want to spend the money for synthetic, a straight GL-4 
oil, 75W or 80W, must be used, NOT GL-5, NOT GL-6, NOT GL-3*4*5.  Use 
of any oil other than a straight GL-4 voids the warranty on the 
synchronizers!  GL-4 oil is available from Pennzoil, Valvoline, and 
many other manufacturers.  Do not be talked out of GL-4 by your local 
supplier who may not have it!  VW &amp; Audi synchros were desinged for 
GL-4 oil; anything but GL-4 oil will cause hard shifting and possible 
damage to unit.  Really!  Trust us on this one.

This unit holds 6.4 pints of oil!
