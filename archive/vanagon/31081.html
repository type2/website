&gt; Has anyone found the web site out there that is talking about a trip in the Summer of 1996 from Vancouver north to the Artic Ocean in Canada?
&gt; I was looking around the other night and found it but now cannot find it again, I did'nt write down the address.
&gt; Any help would be appreciated.
&gt;

The address is http://www.chaco_dot_com/~coyote/trek

I'm the main contact for the trip, so feel free to email me.
