Subject: Puzzle me this ('90 Vanagon taillights)

I disassembled my taillights today, just for the heck of it.  Strangely
enough, I found that there was a bulb missing in each taillight.  Both were
the bottom-center bulb.  There is a socket there, and a lens, but no bulb.

Is there *supposed* to be a bulb there?  What is this lamp for?
