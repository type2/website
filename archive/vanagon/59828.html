I like the idea of a newsgroup. That way when I go away for the weekend 
I don't have 250 new mail messages waiting for me. I can easily browse 
a newgroup and look at the threads to see if I am interested.

If that is a problem, check out the &quot;most recent messages&quot; page
at http://www.automatrix_dot_com/~skip/volkswagen/vanagon-list/

I use this to avoid mailbox overflow, and reading all the spam you see
in newsgroups.
