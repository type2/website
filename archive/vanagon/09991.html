Subject: Request for info about a bus file

Does anyone out there know where I can retrieve a copy of a file called &quot;Should 
you Own A Volkswagen Bus?&quot;  I blundered into this file just before Christmas 
trying to learn how to navigate the Info Autobahn; by the time I could 
reconstruct my steps the file had been removed but the title was still in the 
directory.  I remember that I was in Telnet and at the University of Pisa and 
was just using the seach word Volkswagen when I found it.  In any event, it was 
very amusing and I wanted to share it with my local bus club.  If it is 
available, it should be archieved.
