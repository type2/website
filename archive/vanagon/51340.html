Wannabuser's on the east coast,

Let me add my $0.02 here, I have seen this bus quite a few times and it is
in *nice* shape.  I would say that it is a bit *under*priced and that I
recommend it as a &quot;buy&quot;. (Needs more &quot;Dead&quot; stickers, tho :-)

&gt; Hello all,
&gt; Still for sale, my 1978 VW Bus.  I bought an '81 Vanagon Westy and can't
&gt; afford to keep both buses :( .  Besides, how many buses can you drive at
&gt; one time?
