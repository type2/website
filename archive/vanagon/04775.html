&gt; Anyone want to theorize all the bad things that could happen if
&gt; you add TOO MUCH oil to your vanagon/bus?

Not Theory, Fact: 
Depending on how much you have overfilled you will:

1) blow your rear seal leading to massive leakage;
2) blow the seals around the oil cooler;

3) experience lower overall mpg and more long term wear on the engine.
