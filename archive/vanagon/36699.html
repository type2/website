Subject: Hello everyone.


Well since this is my first posting in the Vanagon 'serv, I'll take this 
opportunity to introduce myself.  I've been deeply interested in VW's 
(primarily bugs) for about 3 years now.  Before that, I hated the little 
cars, made jokes about them, thought that only real men drove American 
iron, etc.  But that was before I drove one (a friend's car) and here I 
am - a changed man forever. :-)

I bought a 66 splitty bus with the 2 extra windows on the back (4 down 
each side) and the jailbars, original insides and everything for $100.  
It's got the big VW logo on the front and the 2 curved chrome pieces that 
run on either side of the VW.  It needs an engine but as we know, that 
really nothing.  The interior is dirty but original and there is some 
rust but nothing major.  

So here I am.  I know hardly anything about busses other than what you 
can learn by working on bugs.  If I see any busses anyplace, I'll sure 
make sure I post them on here for the benefit of others.  I've been doing 
the same thing with my bug finds on the VW listserv.  All fer now!

Slater!
