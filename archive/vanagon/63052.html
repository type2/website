Subject:      Re: Looking for info from up north of TN

&gt;I recently test drove a nice looking Syncro from PA.
&gt;The body was beautiful.  But when I raised the deck lid the motor
&gt;compartment was covered with rust and corrosion.   Is this common in
&gt;cars from the north.   I was certain I was going to purchase the Van
&gt;until I found the rust and corrosion.  The few mechanics I spoke with
&gt;said every nut and bolt on the underside of the van will be rusted
&gt;solid.  Are they correct?
&gt;
&gt;These vans are hard to find.  I don't want to miss out a good deal.
&gt;Someone with rust and corrosion fighting experience please give me some
&gt;helpful information.  At this point I am afraid I will  Have to pass on
&gt;the Van ??????

Kenneth,

I live in Wisconsin were we have lots of salt, ice, snow, and rust.  A lot
of times what is important to someone in Wisconsin is the condition of the
body.  I don't mean that condition of the engine, underbody etc is less
important but mechanical components are much easier to fix (to a degree)
than bodywork, painting etc.  $1000 in bodywork does not get you much these
days but $1000 in mechanical repairs is another matter.   Also the fact
that the engine compartment was not full of oil and other fluids may
actually be a good sign meaning that their are no fluid leaks of any kind.
I have seen some vanagon exhaust systems that look pretty bad in terms of
rust and corrosion but this is regular maintenace stuff and something I
would expect if the van is say 5-7 yrs old or older with the original
exhaust system.  Did the mechanics that said this about corrosion actual
check this van over?  I find a blanket statement like &quot;every nut and bolt
on the underside of the van will be rusted&quot; a bit inflammatory.  If the
price is right, the body is original (that is bondo free, new paint not
masking underlying rust problems) I might take a chance on a van like this.
Properly maintained and detailed engines and engine compartments in the
north like were I live generally do not get rusted up even with minimum
care.  Spewing fluids, ignored exhaust leaks, etc which gunk up thge engine
compartment are more of a problem due to poor maintenanace than rust is a
problem.  If possible find someone familiar with vanagons to take a look at
it with you.

Good Luck
