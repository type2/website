Help!  Having real trouble shifting into all the gears.  Have you 
ever heard of this problem.  Seams to get better after warms up.  
Best way I can describe problem is that I loose the gate to go into 
gear.

Also looking for a good manual for my 1985 Volks Vanagon.

Chiltons stinks and cannot find Motors Manuals

Help help help!!!!!!!!!!!!
