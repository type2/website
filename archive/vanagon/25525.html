&gt;Anyone desirous to find information on how to blow up stuff can
&gt;easily get it from many sources.  I don't think posting the
&gt;aforementioned infomation on Vanagon is going to cause a breach in
&gt;national security.
&gt;
&gt;Just my old teenage hacker mentality re-surfacing...



Sorry, Mike-- didn't mean to offend.

You're right-- it was silly of me to post a partial info as I did. I
regretted it almost as soon as I hit the SEND button.

Personally, I like pyrotechnics, from firecrackers on up, and have done
stuff with them a lot. My concern arose from the vision of what I would
have done myself, if I saw this post, with the complete list of ingredients;
and didn't know what the result would be. If I had some time, I might
have tried it, just to see what would happen. This is what I wanted to 
prevent
in someone else... belatedly.


Of course, keeping my mouth shut, would have been a better way to do this.
