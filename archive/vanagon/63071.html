Greetings to all,

Back from European touring.  There are EV's there, sometimes in numbers but
there were more Ford camper vans; even Muitsubishi vans were more popular as
we cruised through 6000km of the continent.  Watched a fellow back his new
TDI powered motor home out of an alley in Innsbruk.  It was large and seemed
to be powerful enough but he was too busy to talk.  Couldn't break into
conversations with any of the owners because I have no language skills
(unless this one counts).  Spotted a TDI EV shuttle van in Iceland; hotel
said it was excellent and the colors are varied beyond the white we can get
here.  Maybe it would be good to buy it thru a broker in Europe to get the
latest thing?.

Gary
