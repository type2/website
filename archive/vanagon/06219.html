In my tirade about the Toyota, I completely forgot to praise the VW's
The '68 has 280,000 miles we think (sorry about the above--guess
whose e-mail ain't fixed yet...) and the '79 has 158,000, with a
rebuilt at 110,000 which included a new clutch.  It runs like a dream.
The 68 is getting tired all over, but I still wouldn't hesitate to
drive it several hundred miles on a trip.  Maybe this summer I can
really set to work on it...
