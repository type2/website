When i hear of stories such as the T-boned MB, I get the heeby-jeebies.
Look at what most of us on the list are driving. Side impact beams in the
doors? nooooo. Crumple zone up front - about 8&quot;. :(

Maybe the relative position of the driver/pasenger with respect to the
front wheels and suspension might offer some protection...

Horrible thoughts abound.

Although I did hear once that the injury/fatality rate (determined by
insurers), was lower in vanagons than other &quot;minivans&quot;. Could it be that
the old farts driving vanagons get into &quot;less serious&quot; trouble?
