Subject:      fuel problem

Hi all,

Well, thanks to everyone who responded about my oil pressure switch.
I've decided it's worth the $45 for the dealer to do it, I'll just have
both switches in hand when I bring it in.  Unfortunately, that is now on
the back burner.

Today I had well over 1/4 tank of gas (closer to 1/2 actually) when I
left my home.  Approximately 3 miles later, I was fuel-less.  You could
smell it everywhere however.  No visible leaks, so I'm assuming it was a
fuel injector (or more than one :)  So how hard are these bad boys to
replace?  If I can't do it myself, I have to have it towed an hour away
to get fixed, so I'm very willing to attempt this.  While I'm in there,
I'd prefer to replace all 4 than to figure out which one had the problem
(although I'm sure it will be quite evident) if they aren't too terribly
expensive.

Am I right that they are the culprit?  fyi, ran great yesterday, fuel
economy has been normal until today.  What's the chances that the o2
sensor got fouled?  plugs?  Weather is hot as usual, although it was a
brisk 70 this morning (kids were putting jackets on :).

Thanks all!!!
