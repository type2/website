With the 4 speed, non-turbo, non-westy diesel, around 62 mi./hr. is a 
good cruising speed, although I guess it depends on your definition of 
comfort.  The engine is pretty busy at that speed.  Of course, if you 
have a headwind, sidewind, or any kind of climbing, even that speed may 
be impossible.  Top speed is 65 mph, and I don't think the engine is 
affected by driving that speed continuously.  

&gt; 3) What are people's actual experiences with mileage around town and on the
&gt; highway?

I got 26 to 27.5 miles per gallon (US) in city or highway driving.  It 
never varied from that range.
