For those coming from the south, I'm planning on spending thurs. night at red 
Rock canyon campground where two of the past CCC trips have been.  It's right 
off 395 about 30-45 minutes north past the 14 &amp; 395 intersection.

&gt; To recap, some of us from the bay area will be caravaning up to the
&gt; mountains Thursday evening.  We're departing from my house in Moraga
&gt; at 6 p.m., then meeting up with others to depart from the rest area
&gt; of the Altamont pass in Livermore at 7 p.m.  Beg/borrow/steal/buy a
&gt; CB and get on channel 2, good buddies.  
&gt; 
&gt; Plan is to head on up to Yosemite and camp in the free camping spot
&gt; there Kathy Myers told us about.  Vague instructions on how to
&gt; get to Yosemite, and where this camping spot is will follow.  If
&gt; you can't join the caravan, but want to meet up with us at the
&gt; free camp space, please feel free to do so.

&gt; 
&gt; Take the most direct way from your place to Manteca. Then to Highway
&gt; 120. Follow 120 to Yosemite.

&gt; FABULOUS - FREE -
&gt; &gt;Forest Service campground on the west side, on the way into Yosemite on
&gt; &gt;Highway 120. It is called &quot;Carlon&quot; and it is about 1/4 mile off 120 on
&gt; &gt;Evergreen Road - the road into Hetch Hetchy. Just thinking that you could
&gt; &gt;meet Steve and spend Thursday night there. It does not have safe running
&gt; &gt;water so you'll need to schlepp it that far, at least. From there, your
&gt; &gt;drive to Mammoth would only be about 2 1/2 hours - give or take.
