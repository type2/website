&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Yes, but these executables have to be RUN in order to infect a machine,
&gt; &gt;right?  I think this is where the confusion is.  Just downloading
&gt; &gt;something through e-mail (and not running it) is an unlikely way to
&gt; &gt;&quot;contract&quot; a computer virus.
&gt; 
&gt; This sounds to me like a DOS thing.  You should always scan stuff with
&gt; your favorite viral software before you run anything you get off BBS's and
&gt; the net anyway.

It is rumors like this one that keep people like me in work (*sigh*)

  a. The Internet Work sent a file, a decode and then an execuite
     vie email (check the | command). No one ever read that mail. The
     _bug_ in SMTP was the subject of a CERT advisory and all sendmail
     code on all UNIX machines has been updated.
     
  b. Viruses only attack via an execuatable...there are no viral GIFs
     (for example). HOWEVER...running uudecode on something like
      _vw.gif_ that is really /etc/passwd ... but if you permissions
      are set correctly...this will not happen.
      
  c. Getting code off BBS's is always risky...I always v_scan every thing
     that comes within running distance of my machine...
