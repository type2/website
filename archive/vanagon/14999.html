&gt;
&gt;Sagging torsion bars?  About 4 years ago, one of those hot VW mags did a
&gt;71 westy restoration project and they described, quite nicely, how to
&gt;re-adjust the rear torsion bars.
&gt;I may still have that issue...

Do any of our 'bibles' go into this area?  If you could dig
up that issue and let me know which month and etcetera, Alistair,
I'd be most appreciative.  --Ralf
