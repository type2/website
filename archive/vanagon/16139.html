Subject: Administrivia

To make sure you are still subscribed to the list in the past, I've told 
people to just resubscribe.  This is ok, but if your account has been 
&quot;postponed&quot; you won't see that.  I'm going to change my mind and tell 
people to send the line
SET VANAGON
to listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu with no subject. This will give a report 
something like the following (mine):

Current settings are:

ADDRESS = GSKER
MAIL = ACK
PASSWORD = &lt;mine deleted&gt;
CONCEAL = NO
