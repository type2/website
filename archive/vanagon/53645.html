Subject: Re:Carrying Canoes

Does anyone have an opinion (ha ha) on roof top racks i.e. Thule vs Yakima. I
know that Yakima is local  and Thule is foreign, supposedly making a
difference for parts and service, but with so many dealers around me I think
that might be moot. I plan on using it to carry a 12&quot; kayak, only about
60lbs. 
Also has anyone heard of a new Yakima product called the &quot;holy roller&quot;, it is
a device for carrying canoes or kayaks, it has a roller for loading that then
flips around to make a cradle for the boat. They are just coming onto the
market. I haven't seen one yet.

Thanks

PS Regarding the REI sightings. Maybe someone ought to cross reference list
members with REI members to see what comes up.
