Subject: Re: '70 Door Locks

Im not sure i understand the problem.  At first i thought that the door
caNNOT BE UNLOCKED FROM THE OUTSIDE,  but then i had an inkling that once
looked and unlocked, it no longer opens?  hm..  The earlier problemm I had
encounted, and was a result of a broken spring in the door    lock mechanism.
 Once i reconnected the spring, the door would unlock w the key, like a good
bus.   

but, whether or not the lock has be activated should not affect the actually
opening of the door.   Locking with the key turns a dohickey away, meaning
that pressing the handle does not activate the mechism, unlocking it turns
the dohicky back, and allowed the door handle bit to activate the mechanism.
  Are you sure that the key is turning the dohickey back all the way?  Would
squirting WD40 onto the mechanism help?

happy tinkering
