Subject: Re: Tires for a Westy

&gt; 
&gt; I have a set of 195/60 winter tires on 14 inch rims.  Are these too wide
&gt; for a 1989 Westy?  Do I need special tires (ie: light truck tires) ?
&gt; 
Are these on Vanagon rims? 195/60 are quite a bit smaller diameter 
than stock for a Vanagon. I run 195/60r14 on my Jetta, and they are 
about  1 1/2&quot; smaller in diameter than my 195/75r14 Westy tires.
The width should be fine, however, if you don't mind the smaller 
diameter. If you put them on the rear only, you engine revs for a 
given speed will be higher.
