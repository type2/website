Subject: Q about cyl. head temps


What do you air-heads get as readings for your cyl. head temps while
cruising down the highway (warmed up) under &quot;average&quot; conditions?

 Current lust list: a TDI Passat wagon, DC/12v coffee-grinder &amp; blender,
  black currant juice, a moped, hot showers and a faucet top for my '81 westy,
   and last but not least:  a pair of those old-fashioned metal roller-skates,
    made, I think, by Winchester (but any would do) - the kind which fasten
     on to the outside of your shoes, and are length- and width-adjustable
      with a metal key.  They have leather straps for the ankle.  They were
       very popular in the 60's.  Thanks!  /m
