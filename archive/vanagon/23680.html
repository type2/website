Are there any Digijet FI experts out there??  My '83 1.9 Wasserboxer
is running extremely rich from cold start to about half warm (black 
smoke, etc.)  I thought that it was probably a cold start valve
problem 'til I checked Bentley's and discovered that the Digijet
system doesn't use a cold start valve.  I have checked the FI
system voltages and resistances per the manual and all are within 
tolerances.  Anyone had a similiar problem? (or maybe a solution?)

Thanks

jim
