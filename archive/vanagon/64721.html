&lt;&lt; The terms Vanagon and EuroVan are to my knowledge exclusively North
 &gt; American labels. They are unknown over here (in the old world). They
 are
 &gt; genericly called  'Transporter'. The 8/9 seater versions are sometimes

 &gt; labeled  'Bus'  and the more luxerious versions 'Caravelle'.

 And in South Africa 'Microbus' and 'Kombi'.  Are these the original
 German names - Helmut? &gt;&gt;

And on a personal note, Helmut, which ones were and are called &quot;Bulli&quot;? I
heard and have read a few books about the transporter being called by this
fabulous name.
