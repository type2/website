Subject: Poptop restoration

I've been restoring a '71 Westy for about a year and a half now, and while
I'm waiting on engine parts from JC Whitney, I've turned my attention to the
poptop.  The bus originally had one, but the previous owner thought it would
be cool to remove it and just snap a vinyl cover over the hole.  I found a
poptop at a junkyard a long time back, and now that the paint and body work
are done, I'm ready to install it.  Last night I cleaned it real well with
X-14 and Top Job.  It looks like it was painted lightly a long time back
with some cheap paint that's very thin and mostly peeled off.  I scraped
off all that I could and now I'm ready to seal/paint it.  Martha, I dug your
post out of the archives, where you had pretty good results with a product
called Kool Seal.  I'm planning on looking for it tonight around here, but
thought now that it's been a little while you might have some additional
comments.  So how's it doing?  Any leaks or peeling yet?  Thanks...
