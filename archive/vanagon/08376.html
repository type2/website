Subject: Water in gas caused noisy fuel pump

Thanks to everyone who offered tips on how to purge the water from my
fuel system.  After an initial drain, a rinse with a gallon of fresh
gas, a new filter, and a fresh tank with some dry-gas (non-methanol) 
added, everything seems to be back to normal.  I plan to run another 
tank of gas with dry-gas added, then change the filter again and add 
some Chevron Techron.

One interesting note, however.  When I first began to have a problem
I thought it was the fuel pump which had become noisy.  Now that I 
got the water out, the fuel pump is as quiet as it ever was. 
Apparently it did not like digesting those bubbles of water.
