Subject: Re: List of 'lists'


Due to another onslaught of requests for the Air-Cooled FAQ, I'm
going to post it to the list.  My apologies to Gerry. 

If some of you want the rest of the FAQs for Tools/Bus Summary/Rustoration/
Novice, let me know and I'll post them too.  (Unless Gerry threatens to
unplug me!)  :)

		   FAQ for Air-Cooled VWs: General

The Official Web site for the same FAQ may be found at:
       (Vintage Volkswagen World Wide Web)

  http://www.oroad_dot_com/volkswebbin/

There is also a Technical FAQ for general automobiles which is
regularly cross-posted to the various rec.autos.* groups.

The editor welcomes any comments or suggestions for changes, additions,
or deletions to the FAQ.  The email addresses are listed at the end of
the document.  Contributions are appreciated, and the author(s) will be
noted next to the question to which they gave the response- unless, of course,
they don't want to be.

Boring Disclaimer:
Although the information contained in the FAQ is generally the collected
experiences of many VW owners, there is no guarantee made as to the
correctness of this material.  Hence, it is up to the reader to use this
knowledge in addition to thinking, not as a substitute for it.  As Mark
Twain said, &quot;Be careful of looking for advice in medical books.  You
might die of a misprint.&quot; From now on, anytime a &quot;VW&quot; is mentioned, it
is assumed that we are talking about a 4 cylinder, horizontally opposed,
air-cooled Volkswagen engine.  ALSO: see question #1 under the entry for
the Idiot Book.


Looking for suggestions/articles for:
**  Buying a VW (How to purchase a VW?/Which VW should I buy?)
**  Aftermarket Shocks (coil-over, gas charged, air-adjustable, etc.) versus
    stock replacements.
**  What about aftermarket oil coolers?
**  How can I get more performance out of my VW?
    Which leads to:
**  Emissions and VWs 
**  More words for #13.

--------------------------------------------------------------
The obvious first question:
1.) What is the best manual to buy for my VW?

&quot;How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive: A Manual of Step by Step Procedures
     for the Complete Idiot 14th Edition&quot; John Muir.  John Muir 
     Publications: Santa Fe, 1990.  ISBN 0-945465-80-7.
     It is a Bible for novices and experts alike.  Fun reading too. 
     Muir (no relation to the naturalist) obviously was a hippie.  

Buying this book should be one of the first things you do after (or even
before!) you buy your VW.  This book will teach you to love your VW even
as you call it every blue word you know.  This FAQ is not intended to be
a reprinting of everything in the Idiot Book (although much of this
information can be found there.)

The following are the VW official service manuals published by

VW Beetle &amp; Karmann Ghia 1954-1979 ISBN 1 85010 729 7

General Consensus Says &quot;DON'T BUY CHILTON'S MANUALS!&quot;  They are crap.

2.)  Are there any magazines for VW owners/enthusiasts?

Try &quot;Dune Buggies and Hot VW's&quot; or &quot;VWTrends.&quot;  HVWs seems to be more
toward technical stuff, but both of them cater more towards mods and hot
rodding.  Their only saving grace is the wealth of advertising for
shops, parts places, and VW events.  Add a sprinkle of large breasted,
bikini-clad beach bimbos, and there you have it.

3.) Are there any VW Clubs for me and my variety of VW?

Many of these clubs offer newsletters and classified ads for members.

5.) Do I need to use a lead additive/lead substitute in my VW?

Volkswagen stated that all of their heads from about 1966 on have been
made with hardened valves, seats, and valve guides.  Therefore lead
additive/substitute is not needed.  If your heads have been rebuilt,
then the machinist probably used the good stuff.  Silicon-bronze valve
guides are the good ones if that helps.

6.) What does Type 1 mean anyway?
VW categorized the engines and body style together from Type 1-4.  There
is some crossover.

Type 1: Beetle(Bug, Kaefer), Super Beetle, Karmann Ghia, Thing (Safari)
Type 2: Transporter(Bus, Kombi, Camper, Truck, Station Wagon), Vanagon
Type 3: Squareback (Variant), Fastback, Notchback 
Type 4: 411/412 station wagon, sedan

Types 1/2 are characterized by an upright fanshroud with an upright oil cooler
inside it, with the generator sitting on a pedestal, and the fan mounted on the
end of the generator shaft.  The engine number is found underneath the
generator pedestal. (Under the 1-4-3-2)

Type 3 has a rear mounted fanshroud, a fan which bolts to the pulley, the
generator mounted atop the engine (but not on a pedestal, and a flat oil
cooler.  This is sometimes called a &quot;pancake&quot; engine since it is so much
flatter.  The engine number is found between the crankcase parting line and the
oilcooler mount.  Types 1-3 crankcases are made from a magnesium alloy.  The
Type 3 crankcase is structurally identical to the Type 1, and most all parts
will interchange.  However, there is no hole for the oil pressure sending unit
or the oil dipstick.  Type 3's have a separate dipstick hole at the bottom
right of the pulley. (The oil pressure sending unit screws into the oil
cooler.)

There are new crankcases now available for the Type 1-3.  They have
holes tapped for the Type 1 oil sender,  Type 2-3 rear engine hanger,
and the Type 3 oil filler neck, but not the Type 1-2 dipstick.  This can
be added by a machinist, or a dipstick holder is available which
attaches at the Type 3 location.  They are all dual relief and are
available for the 1200 (if you can find them) or 13/1600 engine.  

Type 4 is also called a pancake.  It too has a flattened oil cooler and rear
mounted fan shroud.  The fan is integral to the pulley.  All type 4's have
alternators (except 1970 and 1971 411's).  These alternators are mounted on the
passenger's side in front of the #2 cylinder.  The engine number is found on
the top of the crankcase near the fanshroud.  Type 4 crankcases are made from
aluminum.  Type 4's have virtually no interchange with Types 1-3.

Type 1 engines were installed in all Type 1 vehicles. Type 2 engines had
lower compression, but were the same.  In 1971, Type 2 engines had a
rear mounting brace to help support the engine.  Starting in 1972, Type
4 engines were used in busses.  1980-1983 Vanagons also had a Type 4
engine, but with unique heads and crankcase. Types 3 and 4 always had
their respective engines in them. Porsche 914 also had the type 4 VW
engine in it.

7.) So what size is my engine?

8.) Where can I find my chassis ID (VIN) Number ?

Types 1: Found on a plate in the luggage compartment behind the spare
         tire.  Also found stamped on the frame tunnel under the back seat.
Type 2: Found to the right of the engine in the engine compartment.
Type 3: Found on the tunnel under the rear seat.
Type 4: Found on the left windshield pillar, and under the rear seat.

Starting in 1969, most VW's have a metal plate on the corner of the
dashboard in front of the driver with the VIN number on it.

*******************************************************************************
Here is some more Porsche 914 info. from Dave Darling:

Where to find engine serial numbers:
Also, the engine numbers for 1.7 and 1.8 914s (the 1679 and 1775)
are on the right-rear top section of the case, on a flat boss.  The 2.0L
engine numbers are between the oil filler and the fan shroud, as described.

        Manuals:
        Haynes makes a pretty good 914 manual (the 1969 may be an error):
Porsche 914 4-cylinder 1969-1976 ISBN 0 85696 239 2

        Tires:
&gt;If you have a Porsche 914, 195/60R15 is the largest &quot;safe&quot; size.  If you
&gt;have wheels with the right offset, 205/60R15 may work (it didn't for me).
&gt;Again, 175/70R15 is the stock size.
        If you have wheels with the right offset (i.e., not Bug wheels like
the Riviera mags), a 205/60R15 will fit with some rubbing on the front inner
fender, behind the shock tower.  195's can also rub.  Stock size on some
914s was 165SR15 (== 165/78R15).

        Chassis serial numbers:
914

9.) I need information about the gas heater in my bus/bug/ghia.  Where can I
get my gas heater fixed?  Where can I get a gas heater for my bus/bug/ghia?

&gt;From: wpc_at_po.CWRU.Edu (William P. Claspy)
        Gas powered heaters were made available as a dealer 
option on busses/bugs/ghias for quite a few years for people 
who drove their vehicles in colder climates. These heaters 
work in addition to the stock heat provided by engine heat 
through the heat exchangers on the engine.  They are powered 
by a gas line from the gas tank and use a glow plug, spark 
plug, separate ignition coil and fan.

        Since they use gasoline, gas heaters are inherently 
dangerous, due to the highly explosive nature of gasoline.  
Hence, I have found that almost no one is willing to work on 
them, probably for reasons of liability.  The local VW dealer 
said that he &quot;would take a look at it and see what I can do.&quot;  
I think he has to say that since VW sold the heaters as an 
option.  It sounded like even if he could fix it, the cost 
would be prohibitive, above and beyond the normal high 
dealer repair costs.

        However, many people still have these heaters and 
want to keep them working.  During the fall/winter of 1991 
there was a discussion thread on r.a.vw concerning these 
heaters, initiated by myself and Jack Reed.

        What we found is that there are two places in the 
U.S. that will service/sell gas heaters. (Jack tried contacting 
companies in Germany with little or no luck, as I 
remember.)  The first advertises in HotVWs and VWTrends, 
J.B.'s Heater Service in Castle Rock, Colorado.  Both Jack 
and I spoke with him and both of us came away with the 
impression that he is, to put it mildly, not a person you 
would want to send money to.  Other &quot;blue&quot; words were 
used in describing his character, not only from Jack and I, 
but from others on the 'net at the time.  His prices also 
seemed quite high.  His number is (303) 660-9032.  The 
other person is Ark Mirvis in Hopatcong, NJ.  His name 
came from a guy on the 'net who met him at a show, and I 
have subsequently seen his name in either the newsletter of 
LiMBO (Late Model Bus Owners) or VVWA (Vintage 
Volkswagen Association).  I have not spoken with him, but 
from all reports he is very good.  
6363.

        I have also seen busses equipped with propane 
powered furnaces, and there was some discussion on this 
topic on the 'net.  The problems here are that you need to 
mount a fairly sizable propane tank under your bus, the 
furnace itself is fairly large and has to be put inside the bus 
somewhere, and you need to cut an exhaust hole in the side 
of your bus, which, if not done right, can cause the pilot 
light in the furnace to be blown out from blow-by wind.

        Personally, I finally opted to give up on the gas 
heater option.  I use a wool blanket.  Others have suggested 
that a tight heat exchanger/duct-work system, perhaps with 
an aftermarket blower booster (the kind that fits up front in a 
bus) makes for a perfectly acceptable, warm ride.

9.5 Getting the most from you stock heating system.

&gt;From: sjohnson_at_pcocd2.intel_dot_com  (Steven Johnson)

Here is my generic answer for checking out the heating system for air-cooled
VWs:

First, I want to state up-front that I live in a fairly mild climate
compared to the North-Eastern U.S. and (God forbid) Canada (Brrrrr!).
;)  Anyway, from what I've heard and discussed with people and my
own experience, it seems that heating up a bus does take quite a
bit of time, ESPECIALLY, if your heating system is not in proper
working order AND if your window and door seals AND air vent seals
are not sealing out air completely.

 *** Some people feel that some ventilation promotes better heating.
 *** I don't know for sure on this one.

Let me clarify what I mean by a working heating system first.
If the thermostat and hook-up is disconnected or not adjusted or
the thermostat is not functioning properly, then the baffles that
control the amount of fresh air to the engine are probably wide open
and you will not heat up your engine properly and will not have heat as 
soon as you would if it were working correctly.  Nor will you engine
maintain a proper operating temperature.  This will shorten the life of
the engine as well as lower the optimum amount of heat that could be 
used for warming up the cabin.  I will not go into detail about the 
system, you should refer to a later version of the Idiot book (How To
Keep Your VW Alive! by John Muir) for air-cooled VW's and the 
appropriate Bently manual.  

Next, it is important to make sure that the warm air hoses from the 
fan housing to the heat exchangers (H.E.) are hooked up and sealed real 
tight.  

I think one of the weakest links in this system is typically the H.E. 
because most of the buses are fairly old and most of the used ones you 
buy are worn out and are leaking exhaust into the outer cavity of the 
H.E.  So, most people just leave them off or plugged and live without 
them. (No pun intended).  I think next to brakes and a tune-up, the 
purchase of new or rebuilt H.E. is probably one of the best investments 
you can make for a VW.  Especially if you plan to keep it for a while.  
Even if you sell it sooner, I think these days, you can make the new 
H.E.'s a good selling point.  

The next section is the junction box on the front (front is front) of 
the H.E.'s.  Like all the rest of the system, it is crucial for these 
to be working properly and it would be a good investment to repair or 
replace them so that you don't loose much needed heated air.  

The hoses from the junction box to the car body are also a crucial area.  
Make sure that they are sealed well and that there is no chance for any 
heated air to escape.  The Idiot Book covers the connections to the 
junction boxes and how to adjust them.  

While I'm on the topic of heater controls, I just want to say
that you should not turn on the heater until the car (water or
air cooled) engine is fully warmed up.  I see people all the time 
turning on there heaters when they first start their cars and always 
get frozen before any heat comes out.  This is not only a waste of 
time and discomfort, but it also takes away much needed heat for 
the engine.  I would imagine in a cold climate that this is murder 
on the engine (excessive wear and tear) and as most car people know, 
start up is the most damaging part of an engines life and that it is 
important to get the engine up to it's proper operating temperature 
ASAP.  

Another, overlooked area is the battery and ignition system.  
Especially the integrity of the wires and the misc. electrical
connections.  On the older cars, they become brittle and corroded
such that the connections are not as solid as they used to be. So
the car starts missing, lights are dimmer, and things just don't
seem to work like they should.  Make sure that all of your wiring
is in good order and that there is good continuity between con-
nections.  A bad battery cable can keep your battery from fully
charging and/or keep your start from turning the engine.  Make
sure it is in good condition.  They're cheap.  Do a tune-up on the
car and replace the spark-plugs, points, condenser, cap and rotor
and plug wires if necessary.  Don't try to make them last forever!
Especially in cold weather.

If your door and window seals have had it, then you should replace
them if keeping the car heated is an issue.  Otherwise, you are 
going to loose precious heated air, especially at higher speeds
as it is literally being sucked out of the car.  You can get 
these seals from an aftermarket company listed in any VW rag.

Check the air ventilation box too make sure that the flaps are
sealing when they close.  It's a bear to get too, but again, if
it's cold where you live, then it's worth it.

The stock VW system works well when it is proper working order
and all your door/window/vent seals are working.  Most people
pay $500 - $1000 for a VW and expect all this stuff to work.
I think they're really comparing it to something that costs
twice as much and more than you will ever pay to restore a
VW to proper working order.

10. When I step on my brakes nothing (or almost nothing) happens.  What's up?

There are several possible problems, each with it's own solutions.  The
first thing to do is adjust the brakes (Look in the Idiot Book).  You
should have a little scraping on the front drums. (assuming you don't
have front disks which are self-adjusting.). Then fill the reservoir
with brake fluid.  Bleed the brakes a-la the Idiot Book, then adjust the
parking brake.  If your problems don't disappear, then you need to look
for leaking lines or wheel cylinders (there will be brake fluid running
down that inside bottom of the tires).  Barring that, you need a new
master cylinder.  Some will say that a master (or wheel) cylinder can be
rebuild carefully to be just as safe as a new one. My answer is
two-fold: 1.) You are an adult. Make your own decisions based on money,
availability of parts, etc. and 2.) Weigh the savings against a possible
failure of the system. (yeah, I'm being morbid)

11. What size/type of tire should I use for my VW?

Many readers have mentioned that light truck tires give the best results for
busses.  Several have cited Sears brand as being a good choice.  

&gt;From: tomh_at_metrics_dot_com (Tom Haapanen)
&gt;For a Beetle, a Type III or a Type IV, the best inexpensive choice is a 
&gt;175/70R15 radial.  It was optional on some Beetles and standard on Type
&gt;IVs, and fits well on the common 15x4.5&quot; wheel (and OK on the narrower
&gt;15x4 wheel).
&gt;
&gt;If you have wider wheels (such as 15x5.5), you can still use 175/70R15,
&gt;which sits well on this rim, but you may consider getting performance
&gt;tires (Pirelli is my choice, but they're not cheap) in either 195/60R15
&gt;(a little low, provides better acceleration but speedo shows too high)
&gt;or 205/60R15 (just about right height, but more expensive, and may have
&gt;clearance problems in some models).  You should *NOT* put 60-series tires
&gt;in a swing axle suspension car, though!
&gt;
&gt;If you have a Porsche 914, 195/60R15 is the largest &quot;safe&quot; size.  If you
&gt;have wheels with the right offset, 205/60R15 may work (it didn't for me).
&gt;Again, 175/70R15 is the stock size.
&gt;
&gt;Remember that as a rule of thumb, any given tire will handle better if it
&gt;is mounted on a wider rim.  60-series tires will handle better than 70-
&gt;series, but at the expense of some ride comfort.

Bulli - German nickname for the bus
Fahrvergnuegen = &quot;enjoyment coming from driving.&quot;
Faltdach or Stoffschiebedach - ragtop sunroof
Fliessheck - fastback
Fridolin - a special mixture of the types I, II and III for the postal service
Halbautomatik - auto-stick
Kombi = Station Wagon
Kaefer = Insect
Kuebelwagen = &quot;bucket car&quot;
Kupplung = Clutch
Nasenbaer - type IV (literally: coatimundi)
Samba - nickname for the pre-1968 deluxe bus
Schalldaempfer - muffler
Schwimmwagen = &quot;swimming car&quot;
Stufenheck - notchback
Variant - squareback (type III and IV)
Vergaser = Carburetor
Vierganggetriebe - 4 speed transmission
Volkswagen = &quot;car of the people&quot;
Winker - semaphores
Zylinderkopf - cylinder head
any more??

&gt;   messages delivered to you individually (the default), or you can
&gt;   have a digest of the days messages sent to you, or just receive a
&gt;   short index of the days messages, or turn off the flow of messages
&gt;   completely.  This is done by sending a SET request to
&gt;   listserv_at_sjsuvm1.sjsu_dot_edu
&gt;
&gt;     SET VINTAGVW option
&gt;
&gt;   where *option* can be MAIL (default), DIGESTS, INDEX, or NOMAIL.
&gt;   LISTSERV will confirm your SET request, and send you a list of all
&gt;   your current settings.
&gt;
&gt;   Note that if you have the DIGEST option set, all of the days messages
&gt;   will be delivered to you as one message, requiring you to manually
&gt;   extract a message if you wish to include its text in a reply. DIGEST
&gt;   is most commonly used when you want to avoid being interrupted by
&gt;   incoming messages all day, or you use VINTAGVW in a passive (read
&gt;   only) mode.  Remember, you can always change the options again with
&gt;   another SET command.
&gt;
&gt;o  Searching the List Archives
&gt;
&gt;   LISTSERV also enable you to retrieve any messages previously posted
&gt;   to the list.  You can use the example template below to build your
&gt;   search request in your e-mail message, simply add your SELECT
&gt;   specifications and send it to listserv_at_sjsuvm1.sjsu_dot_edu
&gt;
&gt;  //ListSrch JOB Echo=no
&gt;  Database Search DD=Rules outlim=5000
&gt;  //Rules DD *
&gt;  SELECT (generator or alternator) repair in VINTAGVW
&gt;  print
&gt;  /*
&gt;  //  EOJ
&gt;
&gt;   The above example would return to you any previously posted VINTAGVW
&gt;   messages which contained the words &quot;generator&quot; or &quot;alternator&quot;, and
&gt;   the word &quot;repair&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;o  Documentation
&gt;
&gt;   LISTSERV is very nicely documented. If you would like more information
&gt;   about using the various options within LISTSERV, you can send an INFO
&gt;   request to listserv_at_sjsuvm1.sjsu_dot_edu
&gt;
&gt;     INFO GENINTRO   (to request the LISTSERV General Introduction Guide)
&gt;     INFO REFCARD    (the &quot;reference card&quot; of frequently used commands)
&gt;     INFO DATABASE   (more info on retrieving archived messages)
&gt;     INFO ?          (retrieve a list of other LISTSERV documents)
&gt;
&gt;o  Other Lists
&gt;
&gt;   The rules by which LISTSERV runs prohibit their use for commercial
&gt;   (advertising) purposes.  There is a list starting up on the internet
&gt;   specifically for air-cooled VWs, intended to allow you to query and
&gt;   broadcast information about VWs and VW parts for sale.
&gt;
&gt;   To subscribe to that list, simply send a subscribe request to
&gt;   mailserv_at_cc.owu_dot_edu:
&gt;
&gt;     subscribe aircldvw
&gt;
&gt;   you should receive confirmation that your subscription was
&gt;   successful.  Messages to be posted to aircldvw should be sent
&gt;   to aircldvw_at_cc.owu_dot_edu.   Questions or problems with the aircldvw
&gt;   list should be directed to the list owner, Marcus Kruse
&gt;   (mmkruse_at_cc.owu_dot_edu).

15. Mailing list for Type II VW Enthusiasts  

There is a mailing list started in ~ April of 1994 that is called
the vanagon mailing list that was originally exclusive to vanagon
owners.  However, it has evolved to include all Type II's from
splits to Eurovans.  So if you are interested in discussions about
VW Type II's you should check out this mailing list.

Here's the info. on how to subscribe to the list:

to subscribe
mail to listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu
with one line saying
subscribe vanagon yourfirstname yourlastname
(leave the subject line blank!!!!)

to unsubscribe
mail to listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu
with one line saying
unsubscribe vanagon
(leave the subject line blank!!!!)

to post (now why would you want to do a thing like that?)
mail to vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu

to pester the list owner
mail to gsker_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu


16. Bob Hoover Sermons.

Bob Hoover is a gentleman that obviously has many years of hands-on experience
and has contributed many articles to the list that seem to be very popular with many 
of the mailing list readers.  Someone has taken the time to accumulate and archive these 
'sermons' so that I can point you to them for your own perusal.

Here is the Web address for the sermons:

18. Improving the starter/switch connection and reliability. (Bob Hoover)
       (c) Robert S. Hoover 1996

   [Following is an improvement to the Ford relay starter fix found in
    the &quot;How To Keep Your VW Alive!&quot; manual by John Muir]

   

                           &quot;Solenoid?  We don' need no steeking solenoid!&quot;
                                                     or...
                               St. Muir and the By-Pass Solenoid

((c) Robert S. Hoover 1996)
	 
This one really gets me hot under the collar, first because it ain't a
by-pass-anything, and second because the usual method, using an old Ford
starter solenoid a la St. Muir is dumber than hell, partly because it ain't a
solenoid at all but a contactor, and finally because you just don't need a
starter contactor for this particular job.

The problem is that Volkswagen feeds their starter solenoid 12vdc by way of
China.  They run the juice all the way up to the front of the vehicle,
through the starter switch which isn't all that reliable to begin with, then
all the way back to the solenoid -- which is where the juice started its
journey to begin with.

By the time those 12 volts have marched up front, squeezed through the switch
terminals and hiked all the way back to the solenoid about of half of them
are dead and the others have blisters.  They jump inside the solenoid, put
their electronic shoulders to the wheel but find they're played out by the
trip.  If the solenoid moves at all it does so sluggishly, often not enough
to close the contactor terminals that provide juice to the starter motor.

The fix is to keep those 12 volts from wasting their time and energy on that
useless hike by putting in a RELAY.  That's what that Ford contactor is
pretending to be.  The joke is, the contactor takes almost as much juice as
the VW solenoid!  A wiser choice is a headlight or horn relay.  Cheap, easy
to find and easy to mount.  Screw it to the fender well inside the engine
compartment to help keep the terminals clean.  

What the relay does is tell those 12 volts when to go to work on the
solenoid.  You wire your relay with the same wire originally used for the VW
starter solenoid but you install new, heavier wires -- with a shorter run to
the battery and solenoid -- from your relay.  Since a headlight relay only
needs an itty-bitty amount of power to pick or transfer, the original wiring
provides more than enough energy despite its long run.  And since your new,
heavier wiring provides a shorter, neater, cleaner, prettier, healthier and
politically more correct run between the battery and the VW starter solenoid,
it fires right up every time.

I understand Gene Berg started selling Ford contactors because he got tired
of trying to explain to St. Muir deciples that St. John didn't know very much
about elektrissity.  I know a whole bunch about elektrissity and I'm still
alive, even though I use a headlight relay to pick my solenoid and a horn
relay to turn on my back-up light and an itty-bitty microampere relay out of
a short-wave radio to tell my external cooling fan when to turn on, although
a Ford contactor would have done the job -- sorta -- in each and every case
and would have, if St. Muir had thought of back-up lights and cooling fans.
 (&quot;Back-up lights!  We don' need no steeeking back-up lights!&quot;)

                                                Sermonette

Cold weather brings home the problem of the voltage drop in the long wiring
runs common to a Volkswagen bus.  If you want reliable starts and brighter
headlights you need to know more about heavier gauge main buss wiring and the
use of relays.  You are the mechanic-in-charge of your vehicle.  Sometimes
that calls for you to be an electrician as well.
