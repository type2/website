Subject: 88 Synchro Exhaust and Engine ?

- I am looking for a complete exhaust system for my 88 synchro 
that will not rust even before I install it on the bus. Is there 
a stainless steel system available anywhere or of a good quality 
steel one?
 - The engine is getting a little weak 200k km (bad valve) and I 
would like to get some info on upgrading the amount of ponies 
the 2.1 puts out. I have read the upgrade to a Subaru 2.2 engine 
but I have reservation using a Japanese engine in a VW and 
perhaps that is silly unless someone has done it and finds it 
fantastic, I would rather find other methods (higher compression 
perhaps etc...).

Can anyone please point me in the right direction (positive or 
negative) Thanks !!
