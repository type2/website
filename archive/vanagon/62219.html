Subject: Rear Springs

Hi All,
Does anyone have any experience with replacing the rear springs on a 
Westie? My 85 has a serious sagging in the rear that I think has 
contributed to the front end problem of being unable to get a valid 
alignment. In any case I need to get it level within specs. Is there 
another potential cause for this problem? Thanks for any advice,
Rick
