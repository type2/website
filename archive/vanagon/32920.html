Subject: more on catalytic vs infra-red


Thanks to the many of you who responded with patient explainations for me
regarding different types of heat and their advantages and disadvantages.  One
repsponse in particular, from listmember Leonard Jones, I thought I'd post
to the list for all to see, with his permission...

Martha,

     Here's some scoop on these heaters:

     Neither of these terms are precisely correct.

     There is no chemical catalysis going on here - just combustion.  The
     heaters use a grid of heat resistant wire for two reasons:  1) the
     wire turns bright red or orange when hot and thence generates the
     radiant heat for which they are known and 2) the hot wire supports and
     stabilizes combustion of the propane or Coleman fuel on the wire grid.
     Either of these fuels would &quot;prefer&quot; to burn in one large flame than
     in a spread out way.

     Neither is this entirely &quot;infrared&quot; although there is certainly some
     infrared radiation involved.  Much of the energy from these heaters is
     produced as hot combustion gases and as visible light rather than as
     radiant heat.  (Frankly, any hot object will radiate heat into the
     surrounding spaces.)

     The best use of these heaters is outdoors or in well-ventilated indoor
     spaces that cannot be economically heated by conventional means.  They
     are reputed to produce less carbon monoxide in normal operation than
     conventional burners - although I've never tested one myself.  This is
     good, but they will still use up the oxygen in an enclosed space - and
     when oxygen gets short - then they'll start producing carbon monoxide.
     So, as you indicate, they're really not a safe means of heating up the
     inside of a van.

     Infrared or non-infrared, catalytic or non-catalytic, propane or
     liquid fuel - these things are all basically the same.

     I hope this answers your questions.
