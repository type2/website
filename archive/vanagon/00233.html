I'll try to find my receipts and check it out.

I threatened nicely to call regional management, which seemed to raise 
the attention level considerably. 

My vague recollection is the replacement of the ECU did it, but Ill have 
to check. What a pain in the neck that was to cycle through so many 
guesses and theories.

&gt;   PLEASE TELL US WHAT FIXED your van!!!
&gt;   As to the control unit, the only way I can think of testing it
&gt; is to find someone with the same year vanagon, then switch the units
&gt; [they plug in and are held in place with 2 sheet metal screws]
&gt; to see which van runs properly.
&gt; 
&gt;   Is there anyone reading this in Pittsburgh with an 85 vanagon
&gt; who would be willing to spend 15 minutes letting me try this?
