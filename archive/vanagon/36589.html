Subject: Emissions testing Failed **%%%##$_at_!!!

I have an 86 syncro that fails the emission testing.  There is too much CO2.  
Took it to one of the acredited repair shops listed on the paperwork.  They 
informed my wife that there was a bad injector.  
Questions:
1, Are the injectors different on the digifant than the digijet?
2, If one is bad should I replace all 4?
3, Napa sez they can get em for around $60(Bosch)?
4, Rebuilds are about $40 are they as good as new?
5, What is the difference between digfant and digijet?

I am still gather information on my previous quest(vibration and lurch).
I will look at information then so what happens.  I will summarize and send 
and update to the list.  I am so fed with all these problems I went out and 
put $5000 down on one of them thar new Concept II vans.

Later Dave
