Subject: FIXED: Slow Throttle response on 90 Vanagon

Thanks Tonya, Dan and Joel for your  prompt replies.

The prize goes to Dan! I know your not going to believe me....but I was
trying to get new spark plugs last weekend but the wasserboxer type are hard
to come by here.

The one fitted had only done 20 000km and when I checked them they were
about 0.040 &quot;. I re-set them to 0.027&quot; and test drove...all back to normal.

??? WHY would that cause the slow throttle? I thought I understood the
system but that one beats me.

Anyway, I'm all set for easter with NEW sparkplugs and a bit more knowledge.

Scott
90 Vanagon GL
67 LandRover SIIA
etc.
