Subject: Re: Time to upgrade...

&gt; BTW, can anyone tell me why the Vanagon was discontinued after 1991?

Wow! No-one took the bait?

VW retired that body for the same reason the retired the split window in 
1968 and the baywindow in 1980.  (or call it 1967 and 1979)

They thought they could make more money on an updated body.  The T4 or 
Eurovan.  Its opinion as to which is better and why...

Oh I have a 1993 EV MV and love it....
