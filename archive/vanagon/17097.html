Subject: 'falia sink pump q


 &gt; From: Scott Harvey &lt;CNETSAH_at_mvs.oac.ucla_dot_edu&gt;

V&gt; The pump for my sink has never worked since I purchased my
 &gt; 'falia.  So this past weekend I was on a mission from God to
 &gt; remedy this situation.

Scott, I went through this on my Mexico trip and found out the following:

1. You have to have water in the tank (fill 'er up) because the pump needs
to be &quot;primed&quot; by twisting the on-off knob several times toward the &quot;T&quot;.

2. The battery check switch over the fridge needs to be on.

3. My pump has a fuse that was blown, might want to check it.

That got mine going. Good luck
