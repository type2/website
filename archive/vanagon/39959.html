Subject: Another Tire Q

Ok, here is another tire question for you guys.

I need new tires for my '72 Safare.  Primarily for this 3000 mile trip.
What make/model tire should I purchase that works well on later model busi?

Specs: '72 Safare Custom Camper
       '77 2000cc F.I Engine
	80% Highway Driving

Thanks!
