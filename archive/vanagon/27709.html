Subject: Re: Advice on V6 Vanagon Steering Rack?

&gt;1.) Did/do any Vanagons have power steering?

Yup, my '87 does, don't bother, you need pump, reservoir, plumbing, rack, 
and the rack will likely set you back $500 alone. Buy good 6 or 8 ply tires 
all around for $400 total. Put them to 38-42 (44) PSI and you will have 
effortless steering, better handling and better mileage.

&gt;3.) For an '80 Vvanagon with nonpower steering, how do you replace
&gt;the tie rods? (aka inner tie rod ends, the ones that connect to the rack).

I _don't_ think so, other than seperating the ends from the arms, try 
propane torch and good hammer.


&gt;5.) For an '80 vanagon that's been experiencing wheel shimmy due to
&gt;worn parts, out of round tires etc., do you know of any particular front
&gt;end parts that can get worn as a result? (A pretty vague question, sorry).

Maybe the ball joints, but not if they were good to begin with.


Overall I'd say... you've got a V6, so when you need to turn, floor it, 
steer with the wheels in the air and then let off the gas real fast, it will 
turn effortlessly, round and round and.....&lt;g&gt;   Tim Smith
