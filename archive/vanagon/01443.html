Subject: how to replace rear suspension?


Could you give me the detail step-by-step of how to
replace an '83 Vanagon's (with H2O box) rear suspension?
It has 108K miles now.

Please forward your advice directly to my account.
Thanks in advance.

Regards,
James

p.s. I have the VW shop manual which is not useful at all.
