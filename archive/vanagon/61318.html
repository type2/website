 BatSubject:     auxilary fuel tanks - Syncro           6/12/97    3:41 PM
While at the VW show at West Side VW this last weekend, I ran into a fellow
Syncronaught who said he had seen a Syncro down at Rudy Luthers Burnsville VW
with Dual Fuel Tanks.  

I called Dan, the Syncro expert at B'ville and he came up with a name, but no
way to contact you.  

So Jim Thompson, of the 507 area code, are you a fellow listee, and if so,
please contact me.  I'd like to look at your auxilary tank set up since I have
been considering a similar set up myself.

If not, I promise to try to find him and let him know about our fine list and
that there are lots of others who would love to do the same.

'89 Syncro Beast
'86 Scirocco
'87 GTI 16V, still no power on take off, damn.
