A note from me to the folks who sold me Laredos for the westie.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.....~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Here's the poop on the otherwise excellent 195-75 UniRoyal Laredo LT
    tires.

    I have a 1989 VW Vanagon Syncro (4WD) Westfalia (Camper).  In your 
    reference guide the recommended tire for the Vanagon is the 195-75
    UniRoyal Laredo.  The rating for this tire is 1325 lbs MAX per tire.

    The campervan in question has weight rating of 3000lbs on the rear
    wheels working out to 1500lbs per wheel.  This is a bit more than the
    otherwise excellent tire is designed to handle.  Don in your tire
    department researched the currently available tires to no avail (bad pun). 

    You have had in the past, the capability of ordering tires from Yokohama.

    A suitable tire to replace the UniRoyal is:

The following are the specs on the Y370 that were in the FAX Yokohama
sent me.  The key is to tell your dealer to order tire #37047 to avoid
the possibly of getting the passenger tire.

Yokohama Part No:       37047
Part No:                LT195/75R14 8 Y370 XL OE BTL TL
Unit weight     23.10
Tread Depth     11
Tread Width     5.3
Ply rating      8
Load Range      D
Measured Rim size               6
Alternate rim size              5.0-6.0
Inflated overall width          8.1
Inflated overall diameter       25.6
Loaded Static Radius            11.9
Loaded Revolutions per mile     818
Mileage Warranty Miles          40,000
Warranty Type                   A

Load carrying capacity is 1710 lbs at 65 lbs of air pressure, 1530 lbs
carrying capacity at 55 lbs of air pressure, and 1435 lbs of carrying
capacity at 45 lbs of air pressure.

This will handle the weight of the VW but alas, you have been directed 
not to do any special orders from Yokohama.

What I would like you to do is order a set as described above (I'll buy 5)
and replace the UniRoyals.  You should also update your tire reference manual
to include a higher rating for Vanagon Campers.
