Subject: parts source for intermediate exh.pipe

My 83 air-cooled Westy needs an intermediate pipe that goes between the left
and right exhaust manifold and bends to meet the catylitic convertor. He has
welded all he can. It is so thin and rusty. He cannot locate one here in
Florida. Does anyone know where I can get a new one? Bob in Orlando. Thanks.
