Subject:      Electrolytic Derusting

Hello -

The subject of Electrolytic Derusting came up in the
Ford Truck group and it is an interesting process to
remove rust.  Looks to be a great process for small
parts.  The article was written by antique and old
tool restorers, but then again what is an old VW
anyway!  Anyone ambitious enough to build a
plastic vat for an entire bus?! or Type 3?!
