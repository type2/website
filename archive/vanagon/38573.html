&gt; just replaced my thermostat when i did head gaskets on the '87.
 previously,
&gt;
&gt;the water temp gauge was always smack dab in the middle of the red 
&gt;warning LED.  now it is running completely off but adjacent to the LED on
the
&gt;hot 
&gt;side of the scale.  heater output is wonderful but i'm wondering if i 
&gt;still have some entrapped air causing the system to run hot.
&gt;

The needle on my 87 covers the lower 1/4 of the LED, while the needle on my
88 just touches the top side of the LED.  I don't know if there are actual
temperature differences, differences in senders, differences in gages, or a
combination.
