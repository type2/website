Subject: platinums/clutch

Over the weekend we went down to NopE to get a set of Bosch 
platinums/wires and Mr. Know it all told us how terrible these were and 
that we would be really dissapointed with them(he has given us very bad 
recommendations in the past too), but we bought them anyway($2.96 each). 
So a couple of hours later we installed them and the bus cranked right 
up.  The next day we took a three hour trip to Atlanta and found that 
our mileage had increased(he told us to expect to get about 2mpg) from 
15mpg to 16.22mpg.  After Atlanta we drove another two hours to Athens 
with no trouble, but as soon as we started to leave to go home this 
noise started up.  I could hardly get it into gear and when I let the 
clutch out that growling noise crept up.  The manuals almost descibed it 
but not exactly (as always).  The noise goes away with the pedal 
depressed.  It is the loudest in first gear, a little quieter in 
second...  It can barely be heard in fourth.  What is this, and what can 
be done to fix it?  

Please help us
