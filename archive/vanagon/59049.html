Subject: Vanagon  DIY furniture?

Hey Guy does anyone have plans ? ideas for home made furniture for an 86 
vanagon ???

the PO had fitted a jumbo Hi top and made a simple box in front of the 
engine to create a huge double bed!!  (Great fun ;-) )
A simple frame holds two burner stove top and underneath a camping 
Freeze cool box,   that and a few half hearted hardboard panels complete 
it.  Above the cab a load space, above the rear, a pannel surfaced bunk?
the fibreglass top has no lining.   Too Damm Cold in the winter!

Any suggestions?   

The van its self is a 1600cc Turbo Diesel 4spd.  No Problems.
(good Gas millage)  not as slow as you think(g)

BTW I only have a couple of weeks before heading off to England for a 
month!  HELP,

Regards to all,  Alun
