Subject: Dynamic Oil Pressure System

My 86 Westy has an annoying glitch. The oil pressure light and buzzer come on
like clock work at 3000 rpm. I changed the sender units, both high and low,
the module on the dash and also had the oil pressure checked. If I rev. the
engine higher, the light and buzzer go out until the next time I reach the
3000 rpm mark. I searched the archives and did'nt find any solution. What do
you guy's and gal's think?
