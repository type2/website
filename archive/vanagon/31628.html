Subject: Re: Why do we all love our &quot;bricks&quot; so much?

Howdy.
 
Why do I love my VW so much? It's sure not the ride, or the comfort of
the cabin. I guess it's partly good looks (although these northern
winters are beginning to take their toll).
 
It's hard to describe my feelings more accurately than &quot;they are nifty.&quot;
By this I mean that they are simple, straightforward machines. Their
engineering is straightforward and easily understood by the common Volk.
 
The no-frills approach lends itself to first-time mechanics' problem-
solving (although certain things remain baffling to old-timers, too). In
this sense, they are self-sustainable. (Self meaning &quot;me&quot; self, not &quot;self&quot;
as in Christine, though I have done enough pushing of my bus to expect
a little bit of bodywork in return.)
 
Their basic, straightforward construction is also unpretentious. A bus
fulfills the need to get around, and to move stuff around, with few
accoutrements. Their is no posturing with a bus (well, at least with mine).
 
The bus is a total being, and the same feelings of niftiness I hold toward
the bus in general also apply to its beating powerplant of a heart (run
with my metaphor for a second). Sure, a basic V6 is not a mystery machine
either. It, too, is simple. I appreciate its design. But for me, to love
my bus is to also love its engine.
 
slight digression -- My pop drives a '66 Chevy pickup, just like Clint
  Eastwood in those &quot;Every Which Way...&quot; movies. Actually, that was the
  other GM, and my dad's is a shortbox, but you get the picture. Anyway,
  that's the same deal: basic transport. Metal insides, driver's side
  sunvisor only, small rear window, etc. When the engine died, he put
  one in which he salvaged from a combine. And when the water pump failed,
  he hiked it to Fleet Farm, and installed it on the roadside with a
  screwdriver and a 1/2&quot; wrench. OK, maybe 9/16&quot;. For you psych*sts out
  there, maybe he and his Ford 8N &amp; 9N tractors had something to do
  with my development.
 
I run a 2L type IV, which I rebuilt upon purchasing my bus. My very first
complete rebuild (my only other experience was a ring &amp; bearing job on a
Rabbit Diesel that needed a head gasket). (rebuild experience).
I took as much care as I knew how, following Bentley, Muir, and the Wilson
books. After the initial dread upon hearing the engine break-in rattling
passed, I am super-pleased with the reliability.
 
I used to have a 72 bug which kept running until after the body rusted away.
In sub-zero F temps, the little guy would fire at the first hit of the key.
Best $125 I ever spent.
 
Anyway, my point is this: For ME, transplanting a different engine into my
bus would not make me love it any more. The addition of heat, YES, but a
new engine, no.
 
I don't feel the same way about, say, putting a gas-powered VW engine into
a diesel Vangon. In fact, as soon as I get my head above water, I would
like to 'save my pennies and save my dimes' until I could get a diesel
Vanagon w/ or w/o camper stuff, and w/ or w/o diesel. I used to have a
rabbit diesel, well, still have. I also still have what's left of that bug.
And a coupla squarebacks to keep it company... You folks know how THAT goes.

P.S. For Christmas, my pop got me some of those there LaCrosse Iceman boots.
Good down to -80 degrees F. My feet still got cold during the 3 hour drive
home. And this is after insulating the cab and separating it from the rear.
