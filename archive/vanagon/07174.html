&gt; the campers, is questionable (due to the 'low' numbers sold over here).

&gt; now ... having said that, i have found that if you run the system at least
&gt; 15 minutes every week or two, it really really does make a difference. i had
&gt; been adding two little bottles of freon every June since i bought the car
&gt; .. and somebody convinced me that weekly running would keep the seals and
&gt; things all nicely lubricated so the system didn't leak. so i tried it. and it
&gt; worked. :)  it's been a couple of years since i added ANY freon to the system
&gt; at all.

I've been doing this for years, even in January in Ontario. About five
minutes or so every couple of weeks. I've even seen this hint in a manual
for a Maxima.
