Subject: Re: Forget the Drums, How do you get the Lug nuts OFF!

&gt;      VW, I have found, has a real problem with over tight lug bolts.
&gt;        I think this is because of the precision of the bolt rim
&gt;        interface, being to accrate. I always tighten mine by hand 
&gt;        or use a torch wrench.
&gt; 
&gt;       NEVER LET THE BRAIN DEAD CORNER MECHANIC TIGHTEN THE LUGS
&gt;       WITH AN AIR WRENCH.

I insisted the tire shop use a torque wrench, and I've done the same 
ever since &amp; not had a problem getting them off with a cross bar.
