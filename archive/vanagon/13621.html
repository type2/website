&gt;&gt;  I was just now changing the oil in my '74, getting it ready for the trek
&gt;&gt;  to Red Rock. I took off the sump and strainer and there are PIECES OF
&gt;&gt;  METAL IN IT!!!! Bunches of them, mostly small, roughly 2 mm in diameter,
&gt;&gt;  but some are larger, about 6mm by 3mm, bent and sharp. They are all very
&gt;&gt;  shiny and they are not magnetic. I'm guessing it is the aluminum timing
&gt;&gt;  gear on the camshaft.
&gt;

Do these look like the curls that a metal drill bit would take off, sharp 
edged little C-shaped bits. &quot;Bent and sharp.....shiney&quot; sounds about right. 
If they are fine curls it may be from someone tapping a thread into the 
block. If the bits are chunks with granular/pebbley (sp?) edges, then they 
have indeed broken off something. Clean them up, then see if you can 
distinguish any machined surfaces on the pieces, ie fine smooth surface 
marks oriented in the same direction, as well. This would imply broken bits. 
Maybe someone forgot to flush out all the oil passages after an align bore? 
Do the oil gallery plugs look new? Change the oil, clean the strainer, and 
since you didn't say you motor was complaining, try it for a short while, 
then check the strainer again.   tim s.
