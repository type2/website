Subject: 87 water pump

Just wondering---

My 87 GL has 131K miles on it now.  Seems like a water pump should go
out soon.  The 84 deisel Rabbit I used to have blew its around 135K.  It
was very obvious too, steam blew up and water leaked everywhere under
it.  Will it be as obvious on the Vanagon?  What will it's symptoms be
so that I don't damage my engine accidently?

Thanks--
