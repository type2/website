Subject: Re: Lousy idle and 009 dist.


&gt;I run the 34 PICT-3 and the .009 dist. on both my '71's.  They both idle
&gt;well, but have the same off-idle flat spots.  After experiencing this
&gt;setup (especially on the Bug), I wouldn't go back to the vacuum setup.

Ditto, and Amen....

&gt;Now, when I first got the .009, it took me quite a while to find the right
&gt;combination of timing and carb settings to get things to run right.
&gt;What worked best for me was a timing setting of 7.5 BTDC, and a larger
&gt;main jet.  

So where can we find alternative jets for our stock carbs?


&gt;As far as the off-idle flat spot, well, I've just learned to live with it.
&gt;Fancy footplay with the accelerator has become second nature to me.
&gt;The gain in performance more than offsets the annoyance factor.

This was an early form of Fahrvergnugen.  The air-cooled Bus - a car that
you DRIVE, not ride in....
