&gt;	Anyway, my new problem is that I cannot get the O2 sensor out of my 
&gt;cat. conv. it has rusted into place.  I went by Midas and they could not 
&gt;get it out.  They said that they could heat it up, but that it would melt 
&gt;the threads and I would have to get a new cat., which would be $300 or 
&gt;something.  I have sprayed the bee-jesus out of it with Liquid Wrench but 
&gt;it still will not move. I'm not panicked yet...for I know that there must 
&gt;be a way!  If any of you out there have any idea what that way might be 
&gt;please let me know.  Thanks.

Use the torch gently.  An insert can be welded to the cat for repair if
needed.  If damage not too bad, An 18mm ford spark plug insert works
perfectly.
