Subject: ListServ

All,
I have been thinking about taking over the list for some time now.  I
would
need your feed back on some of my ideas.  I propose taking all existing
threads
and importing them into a Lotus Notes Discussion database that can be
categorized by what ever topics we all choose, full text searched,
seperate
views for soliciations etc.  (Look at
http://domino.lotus_dot_com/area/discuss for a sample)

The information in the list is valuable and needs to placed into a
repository
that can be easily searched and added to.  In a sense the list would
nolonger
be a listserv but become a web site.

I have a site availble to me.  I would try do this free of charge to the
list
members but would also try to solicite funds from vendors.  My goal is
not to plaster
all pages with adds, but provide an area where vendors can post
information and
obviously get funds to support the site.

My MAIN concern is the information, I own a vanagon and have used the
list
and skip's repository countless times.

Please give me your feedback.
Thanks,
Dan
