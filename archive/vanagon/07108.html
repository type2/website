&gt;&gt; Trivia question of the day - In &quot;Alice's Restaurant&quot;  is there a year 
&gt;&gt; mentioned for the microbus?  This is semi-serious, as my record player is 
&gt;&gt; defunct and I have not gotten a CD of this album.  

No.  No year reference.  Just a red VW Microbus.

&gt;&gt; In addition, what other musical VW bus references does anyone know of?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I know of:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Artist			Song			Year	Type/Note
&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;&gt; Arlo Guthrie -	 	Alice's Restaurant	'??	Microbus
&gt;&gt; Kraftwerk		Autobahn			Bug sound effect
