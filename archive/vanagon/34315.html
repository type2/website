&gt;Impressive German ingenuity...
&gt;
&gt;The VDO (Kenzle) clock.  I took this puppy apart last night.  Some sand 
grains
&gt;were found in the casing.  I got it to werk almost for about 50% of its
&gt;&quot;stroke&quot;.  THis is where the ingenuity comes in.  It appears to me the
&gt;clock operates via a contact (point) system similar (visually) to the
&gt;points in the distributor).  As the clock ticks along the gap between these
&gt;&quot;points&quot; lessens until current is transmitted across the gab to reset a 
lever
&gt; (for lack of a better word) against a tension spring. The lever and spring
&gt;unit becomes engaged into a gear which provides the potential energy for 
the
&gt;intricacies of this clock... And the gap closes..

So it's a spring-powered wind-up clock, that periodically rewinds itself
with 12VDC (or 6VDC) power?  Kewl...
