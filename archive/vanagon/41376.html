Subject: Re: Key Serial #'s


 I know VW can make keys based on the
&gt;number, if you have it, but always wondered how you got it.  Also, 
&gt;can the lock be re-keyed to another serial number? 


I have taken lock cylinders to the VW dealer many times to have 
keys made from the key code.  (You can just bring in the code from 
the cylinder, but if you bring the whole thing they can test the 
key before you leave.)  The dealers charged between $3 and $7 for 
the key.  In a couple cases (with a '59 bus and a '63 bus) it was 
neccessary for me to go to a locksmith and buy a blank for a buck, 
and then bring it to the local VW dealer because he no longer 
stocked the blank.  Only once did I come across a dealer who no 
longer had the punches to make a key for a 60's or 70's VW bus.
Also, the local independent VW specialist, who also has the key 
punches, told me that it would be easy and inexpensive to 
disassemble the cylinders and rekey all the locks to work on the 
same key.  I plan to take him up on it wih my '63, which currently 
has 3 keys plus the churchkey, and will have 4 once I find the 
correct drivers door handle!
