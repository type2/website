Subject: re: Sources for ECU

I had to replace the one in my '85. Cost me about $200 for a rebuilt from 
Halsey in Portland. 

I kept the old one thinking I could repair it ($50 core charge). There's 
not a whole lot of parts inside the thing but to keep people out of it the 
parts are coded. Has anyone been able to repair one of these things or get 
ahold of documentation?
