Subject: VW-Job Interview

Of course I'd drive my Bus to a job interview.  It gives your prospective
employer an fairly accurate picture of what they are getting for their
money.  The real issue is FAILING to drive your beat-up and tired looking
crate to the initial meeting.  When I first applied to work here at RAND
in 1985, I drove our Fiat 124 because I thought it made me look half way
presentable (though I probably had to fix something on the way to the
interview; thank God for small tubes of hand cleaner).  I got the job but
on my first day I drove in the Bus.  Parked it in the lot, grabbed my
lunch, and went in inside.  When I came back out at noon, I went to where
I thought I had parked the Beast but couldn't find it.  I assumed that
senility had set in prematurely but when I searched the entire lot, nada.
Why anyone would steal my nine-toned, loud and obnoxious, and barely
running hulk was beyond me.  I went to the security desk to report a stolen
car and was flabergasted to learn that a secretary had reported that
strange people were living in that wreck and the guards dutifully had it
towed and impounded.

Hmmmmm.  Should have driven it to the interview, I guess.


Nick
