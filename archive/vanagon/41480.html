Subject: one more '66 question (dog-house fan shroud)


All,

One more question about my '66 fan shroud.  I'm mounting a dog-house
cooling system on the engine I'm building and the dog-house shroud has
a small (mebbe 1/2 inch) pipe sticking out the *top* of the shroud off
to one side a bit.  This is in addition to the two fresh-air-heating air
ducts on the *back* (back means back of the car) of the shroud that connect
to the heat exchangers and the duct on the *front* of the shroud for the oil
cooler exhaust.  What is this pipe used for?  (I guess this is a good
question for 1971 bus owners or for 1971 and later sedan owners since that
was where the dog-house cooling tin was used.)

Thanks for any info,

 -Dyer
