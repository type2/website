Subject: Re: 914 trans in a bus?

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;        &gt;I was wondering if it would be possible to swap a 914 5-speed
&gt;&gt;transmission into my 73 bus.  There is one for sale in the paper for
&gt;&gt;$100. It sure would be nice to have a 5th gear, and closer ratios (I'm
&gt;&gt;assuming with 5 gears the ratios would be closer).  Anyone have
&gt;&gt;experience with this?  I know the engine turns it in the wrong direction,
&gt;&gt;but I heard once that there was some shaft that could be reversed, or
&gt;&gt;something.  Help?

&gt;The ring and pinion can be flopped to the other side, but I would not recommend
&gt;it. If you were to look at the way the ring &amp; pinion mate, and you were to move
&gt;the R&amp;P to the other side of the tranny, you have changed surfaces of the gears
&gt;that will carry the load. This will work, don't get me wrong, but it will
&gt;probably be a noisy beast.Just my $.02

The gears will still be driving in the same direction though, so the faces 
will mate the same way. I don't know the specifics of putting one of these 
boxes in a bus but I do know several people who have put them in Beetles. 
There is a slight clearance problem but that probably won't occur in the bus.
