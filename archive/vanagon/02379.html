&gt; 
&gt; I hope someone can answer this.  I need to front tires for
&gt; my '91 GL and have been to the local Michelin shop here in
&gt; Sacramento.  He says the tires for the vanagon 205/70 R MXL's
&gt; (reinforced) are on back order and can only be ordered 2 at
&gt; a time.  Has anyone else had problems getting these tires?
&gt; Is there a good substitute?  I vaguely remember reading something
&gt; about Continentals.

	Yup, I've a '91 Camper and it's at 43K and needs at least (2) tires.

	After queries on options, I've determined the MX Ls are the logical
	choice.

	Price-wise, Surprisingly, I find Sears to be best at $86 per, but only
	(2) available.

	Sears guys says Michelin is discontinuing the MXL (Reinforced). So,
	grab 'em while you can.
