Subject: Whaaaa!!! I can't read the FI fix article!!!



  Hi list,
 
  I'm a new subscriber who's currently working on (i.e., replacing) the
  engine in my '81 Vanagon.  The &quot;Welcome to the List&quot; message I
  received after subscribing mentioned the archived articles, so
  I wandered over for a look.
 
  I was reading an interesting article written by hugie_at_lindy.stanford.
  edu posted June 13, 1994 entitled &quot;1981 Van running rich, FI problems
  SOLVED&quot;, but the article cut off in mid-sentence!  And just when he
  was getting to the point of explaining how the problem was fixed!
 
  Anyway, is there anywhere else in the internet where this article
  might be found?  (Or, if hugie_at_lindy.stanford_dot_edu is still on the
  list, and this article is still on your computer, I'd love to see
  it reposted.)
 
  Thanks all.
