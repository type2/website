Subject: lakeport update


Here's who's going to the Lakeport festival this coming weekend.  Note
that we've lost a few and gained a few.  Any more takers?  Please 
let me know ASAP....

Bradley Magnesium               bradleym_at_netcom_dot_com
Martha Rubin                    nrubin_at_s1.csuhayward_dot_edu
Jim Thompson                    busboys_at_aol_dot_com
Ken Bowen                       kenb_at_SIRIUS.COM  in SF
Albrecht Jander                 jander_at_hplgauss.hpl.hp_dot_com


Now, Jim Thompson won't be able to join us until Saturday,
when we're actually in Lakeport.  What I'm about to say pertains
to Friday evening, which is the time we've designated to
camp further west on the coast, hopefully at Gualala, and here's
what I suggest after talking to/polling everyone.

The last person to be free on Friday is Albrecht at 4:30 in Palo
Alto.  It would seem nice to be able to caravan, so I'm going to
suggest that we all meet at 6:30 in Marin at a place Bradley Prunehead
suggested, which I believe is called something like the Marin
Brewing Company (?).  There we'll of course have beer, and hopefully
there'll be a place nearby to get some pizza/whatever.  Thereafter,
we can caravan up 101 and then over to the coast to Gualala, which
is north of Sea Ranch.  

Now the problem may be that Gualala (which doesn't take
reservations) will have become full by the time we all arrive
late(r) in the evening.  But, the good part will be that we'll
all be together and can collectively search for an alternative
site without worrying about stray members.  The seems to be preferable
to two or so of us going up early and not being sure if we
can reserve more than one site.  Also, it was the concensus
of the group that it would be fun to caravan.  I have a CB,
and Prunehead has offered to wire up two of his portable CB's
for you (Albrecht and Ken), so that we can all communicate
while driving from Marin to the coast.  Also, at least having
dinner together will be more fun than being all separated
at this time.

Along those lines, I suggest since there are so few of us (and
certain members have specific dietary preferences), that we
not do as I had suggested earlier about the potluck for thie
trip, but that we just rather each bring our own food for
the entirety of the weekend.  If you want to bring something
to share in the way of snacks or dessert, this would seem
a nice idea, but no one will be depending on it.  Also,
keeping in the tradition of vanagon.lenti, I rather imagine
that many of us will be bringing brews, and those are always
interesting and fun to share and taste test, but again, this
is not obligatory.  Just bring what you like to eat and drink.

Keep in  mind that the weather over at the coast may be very
cold, and that in Lakeport quite the opposite.  We're going to
be taking some winding backroads to get from 101 over to Gualala,
as there is not really a direct large-type highway, so you may
want to bring your gas can, particularly as we will be travelling
latish.  

Think that's about it. Oh, Bradley - can you please post for
us the location (and hopefully directions) of this brew place
in marin (San Rafael, I think)?  See you all on Friday, and if
you have any questions, please feel free to phone me:  510.376.4321.
