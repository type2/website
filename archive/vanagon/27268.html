Subject: Electrical mysteries solved

After much confusion I read the maual carefully. There was a small section
about polarising one's genertaor. So I tried it. I removed the fanbelt and
wire up the generator as stated in the manual, and ran it as a motor for 15
seconds. 

When I replaced the connections and the fan belt and started the bus the
following happenned. (sp?)

The generator light went off when the revs went over 800 rpm and the voltage
showed a slight increase when the revs went up to 2000rpm. The volts remained
the same when I put on the headlights.

Thus the mystery was a lack of polarisation in the generator.

Now that things are running fine we can consider a camping trip and I guess
that it is now to Lake Isabella.

PS I checked the valve clearances and reset the point gap to 0.018&quot;, and
noticed that the timing was a little too much advanced. When you run with the
timing off the cylinder head temp runs a 500-550 instead of 350-500. so I
have to reset the timing with a timing light.

have fun and maybe see you camping
