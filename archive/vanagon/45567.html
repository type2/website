Subject: Wiring diagram needed for 67 Rusty

&gt; Subject: Wiring diagram needed for 67 Rusty [T1]

&gt; What I'm wondering is:  is the wire coming from the brake
&gt; switches supposed to plug into the flasher relay somehow?  That
&gt; would make some sense but it

The wire (BK/R) coming from the brake switches on the master
cylinder goes to terminal 54 on the flasher relay.

&gt; doesn't explain why I have an extra wire going to the tail
&gt; lights.  This wire is inside the original wire loom, too.  &lt;sigh&gt;

Unless you have the wrong wiring loom....or....the PO designed
his own approach.  I have a full-color diagram for the 67 US bus
in front of me and four 67s in the barn/garage.  The wires that
come out of the loom in the engine compartment for rear lighting
should be:

1)  RR Brake Black/Purple - from HR on T/S Switch
2)  RR tail  Gray/Red     - from fuse 6 (which comes from
                               terminal 58 on light switch)
3)  LR Brake Black/Yellow - From HL on T/S Switch
4)  LR Tail  Gray/Black   - from fuse 5 (&amp; 58 on light switch)

Note: #2 above continues from RR tail on to license light.

Note Also:  The brake light wire attach to the T/S switch via two
1-terminal connectors below the dash as all wires coming from the
T/S switch are soldered inside the T/S case with the other ends
terminating under the dash.

&gt; Any help would be appreciated.

Hope this helps some (67 only, folks).  Let me know offlist if
there are more problems I can help with.
