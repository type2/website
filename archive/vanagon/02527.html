Subject: Re: westy tipping?

I don't know if they all tip over on the left but my second westy '87 went
over on the left. (totalled, now in pieces in the attick, including all the
camper cabinets, seats, etc.)

This left thing is a piece of propaganda put out by Adventurewagon in the
late 1980s to support why their campers are supposed to be better than
westys. But perhaps he was right...
