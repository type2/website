&gt;From: Joel Walker &lt;JWALKER_at_ua1vm.ua_dot_edu&gt;

&gt;anybody want a beater 85 vanagon GL?  dove blue metallic ... uhhhhh, with
&gt;a large scrap along the drivers side rear half (got too close to a white-
&gt;colored building? truck?), windshield wipers were not tightened down,
&gt;engine pretty dirty.  guy wants $2300 (started last week at $2500). likely
&gt;will take less. car located in Tuscaloosa, AL.  &lt;over 100,000 miles ...
&gt;can't remember exactly&gt;.

85 dove blue, scrape on the left rear half, loose wipers (one of our cats like
to climb up onto the roof), over 100k miles.  That sounds like our Vanagon!
I guess VW engineering designs them to look the same years later. :)
