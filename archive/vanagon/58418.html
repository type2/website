Subject: black mystery box

I was removing the air conditioning system from my '81 today, and on the
passenger side, below the dash, and below the big plastic box that houses
the interior air conditioning stuff, was a little black box screwed to the
metal air duct.  It is maybe 3&quot; by 3&quot; by 1&quot; thick, very light, and has
several wires coming out of it that go to the fuse panel.  Doesn't seem to
be part of the air conditioning.  Does anybody have any idea what this is?
I have looked in both my manuals, but no luck.

Also, anybody need air conditioning parts?  The PO said the compressor was
bad, but the rest are probably OK.

Thanks,
Bill
