Subject: [F] rain-x and windshield polish

&gt; 
&gt; windshield polish: we polished my nephew's windshield with some extremely
&gt; fine paint/body polish (rubbing compound) and it made a tremendous difference
&gt; .. it got all kinds of stuff off the glass, made it really really really
&gt; clean. it also made the water bead up, like rain-x. eventually, it wears off
&gt; though ... and i thought surely it would smear from the wipers, but it didn't.

windshield?  Jeez, some people have all the luck.
