 I haven't found any garage that will even DO a front wheel alignment
without doing the rears too. They keep telling me that in order to do it
the rear wheels have to be correct first. Something to do with how their
ten zillion dollar computerized Align-o-matic machine works. The best
price that I was quoted was around $60 (4 wheel).
