&gt;Now is it true that in order to get in there and look around and solve 
&gt;this problem, I have to drop the engine?  Can't I just cut a hole in the

On a '78 I know that if you take the intake system off (in my case a
Weber progressive) and remove the bolts holding up the rear cross beam so
that the back of the engine can be lowered an inch or two, you can JUST get
the tank out.  As for what could be causing the problems, about the only
thing it COULD be (unless your fuel lines are leaking - that would be a lot
easier to fix) is the filler inlet which they supposedly fixed, and the vent
tubes.
