Good point.  The set-up to re-machine one of those parts is the same 
as if one was machining it from bar stock, but with less to hang on 
to.  Probably not cost efficient.  Also have to add in the operator 
time for inspection of a cleaned part to see if it is worth re-machining.
But an observation well made.
