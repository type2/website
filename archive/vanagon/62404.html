Subject:       Help! '88 Clutch problem (I'm back...;)

After a long restless period with our new baby girl and without V_at_L, 
I must re-subscribe.
Since my last posting, Josie (our baby) is now 8 weeks old and about 
13-14 lbs, and Kyra (our Westy) is now at ~ 342k, but complaining 
bitterly at the lack of attention...

To the point:

We just finished a 2 week long meandering tour through the lesser 
known roads of BC and Alberta, and were about to tackle the Duffy 
Lake road from Lilloett to Pemberton when the clutch decided to 
randomly disengage, usually during 3-2 shift on a 15% uphill grade...
A visual check showed brake fluid was fine, no master or slave leaks, 
pedal felt normal (and discovered a leaking PS line, but that's 
another story). I recalled that the pilot bearing had been done twice 
by the PO and started pondering just what the heck it does, and why 
this $6 part could be causing all this annoyance. 
Anyway, the problem was worst after 1-2 hrs of hard driving it 
seemed, but we made it another 300+ kms home with little drama aside 
from a few missed &quot;speed&quot; shifts.

My questions:
1. Will a failed pilot bearing cause the clutch to disengage 
randomly, and usually only for a few seconds? ie: If going into gear 
from a stop would not work, stopping engine, then starting in first 
gear with clutch in would usually lurch a few times, then clutch 
would release. Sitting at a light in 1st with clutch in would 
sometimes lurch or even stall, maybe one in 4-5 times.

2. I assume a failed pilot bearing is created more &quot;play&quot; in the 
input shaft, which does not sound healthy. How bad is it to continue 
driving say another 100kms? (I really need 2 vehicles for the next 
few days until I can pull the tranny)

3. While I'm pulling the tranny, what else should be 
checking/replaced? The trans/clutch is a VW rebuilt with ~170k kms 
on it. (4th gear whines a bit, but I can't afford to open the trans 
right now.)

Thanks for any advice, and please e-mail direct, as I'm not sure if 
I'm really sub'd yet.
