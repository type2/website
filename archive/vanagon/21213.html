Why would you want tent canvas? (If you are a resto head, my apologies,
carry on)

My Dad's boat needed new canvas awnings and stuff all the way around.
We could have gotten heavy, absorbant canvas. Instead, we got
some waterproof ripstop nylon (tent fly fabris) for the top
and regular rip-stop for the sides. Now, it dries out in about
5 minutes, blocks the rain just as well, wash the salt out in
2 minuts (not as important for vans) and stows in 1/10 the space
(important for westies). It was cake to sew (took me about 2 full
days to do 14 yards of canvas), and did not require a heavy-duty
sewing machine.

Think about it.
