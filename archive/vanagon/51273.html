Subject: sighting...

Well, last Friday, while returning home from grocery shopping, I saw
a nice gray Syncro GL heading up towards Yosemite.  I caught up with
him, eventually passed him, and did not get a wave )^:  So, another
of them thar uppity snob stinkrow drivers!  Was it you?  I was in my
GL (a non-syncro, mind you), on Highway 140...

Driver was one of them long-haired, bearded guys, you know the type?
Hair in a pony-tail?  Probably listening to Grateful Dead music.

Looked like me.
