Subject: Re: Cheap alarm system...

&gt; Hi Everyone.  I just bought a &quot;dummy&quot; alarm system for my 
&gt; mother-in-law's Golf, and thought I would report my findings.  I have 
&gt; full-blown alarm systems in our Golf Diesel and Syncro Westy, and 
&gt; don't think I would buy another alarm system for $1100 when I can buy 
&gt; this &quot;dummy&quot; system for $29.95 US.
&gt; 
&gt; This system has a switch blank with a red LED installed in it, wired 
&gt; to a flasher-diode thingy that is all sealed.  There are 3 wires 
&gt; needed to make it work... Ground, 12 volts switched, and 12 volts 
&gt; unswitched.  I used the headlight RED wire for the unswitched, and 
&gt; the rear defogger yellow/black wire for switched.  It blinks when the 
&gt; key is off, and stops blinking when it is on.  No false alarms.

Lets see about a buck (or much less haven't priced such components lately 
- 1 timer, 1 regulator, 1 LED, some wire, and what the heck a fuse) of 
electronic/electric parts.  No idea on the switch blank.  This is a panel 
to fit where an uninstalled accessory is or something I guess.  Looks 
like a tidy little profit.  No problem, its the American way.  His idea, 
his profit.  It is quite a bit easier to get it epoxied together than 
figure out how to 'wire' a 555 timer or what ever he chose.  Would cost 
quite a bit more for parts to get them one at a time rather than bulk 
too.  Still cheap if you can get them at a ham-fest or something.  If I 
decide to install one though I'll scavenge parts from a broken 
video-pc-radio gizmo.
