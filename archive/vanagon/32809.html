Subject: Re: 1600 used as lawn ornament...

Ran into a similar situation a few months back and Bob Hoover turned me on
to a good suggestion. Mine was a $50 engine that a local kid &quot;rebuilt.&quot; I
didn't trust someone elses' rebuild enough to plug it in and go, though I
probably would have gotten about 10 miles on it...well, maybe 10. One of
the heads was cracked, and there were a number of other problems (though I
did get a brand new set of pistons and jugs in the deal). Anyway, I had
never rebuilt an engine, so I wanted to stay clear of the lower end if
possible. Fear, paranoia, lack of tools, experience, time, or local
friends...anyway

Bob recommended that I get some diesel fuel and use that in the cleaning.
I put it into the case, sloshed it around as much as I could.._dot_used
brushes to scrup the parts I could reach. I sloshed, and sloshed, and
sloshed some more. I captured all the drippings and examined them for
metal chunks. What I found was mostly organic stuff and metal glitter; not
TOO much, but enough to make me pay attention...especially the organic 
stuff; sticks, leaves, etc. 

I rebuilt the top end. When I changed the break-in oil, I didn't see too
much organic stuff (very little, actually), but I did notice some
flakes---glitter. For a myriad of reasons...other problems that kept me
from driving the bus, I only put about 50 miles on the bus before I had to
pull the engine again. When I changed the oil that time, though, I wasn't
expecting anything strange...I didn't try to run it up to warm; I just
drained it cold so I could pull it. THAT's when I noticed the motherload
of remnants from the old, dried on oil.  Apparently, it loosened more and
more as it was heated. I've only put about 15 more miles on it since I got
the engine back in it, but I'm planning on driving it maybe 150 miles and
changing the oil again--HOT.  I'll repeat these frequent HOT oil changes
until I'm satisfied that what's coming out is what I put into it. 

If you've got the time and skills, or friends who have done it before, I'd
suggest you split the case. You really don't know what you're working with
now...and you won't unless you split the case and go through all the
steps. I still wonder if I made the right decision, and frankly, I've
spent enough time on this one to have rebuilt two completely. Part of that
was a learning curve for me...and a shoestring budget...and being
slow...and making stupid mistakes. Even with a set of rebuild heads, I
only have about $300 into my rebuilt engine, so I'm kinda happy...for now.

Good luck! Joe

&gt; I purchased an engine yesterday from a gentleman who looked me in the eyes
&gt; and told me that it had been pulled only because it smoked. Six months ago.
&gt; No rod noise. No knocks, really! At a hundred dollars, I deferred.
&gt; 
&gt; Having got the tin and heads and cylinders off, I can tell that this engine
&gt; has sat out for some time. A *long* time.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll do the rings, but I don't intend to crack the case until I try it out.
&gt; The question is:
&gt; 
&gt; What do you do about oil that has congealed into a gelatinous mass inside
&gt; the crankcase?
&gt; 
&gt; Run it, heat it up, and drain it?
&gt; 
&gt; Try squirting solvent into the top and out the bottom?
&gt; 
&gt; If I run it, I have to break in the rings at the same time I'm trying to
&gt; wash this crap out of the case. Any suggestions appreciated.
