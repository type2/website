&gt; Anyway, I see there being 3 options:
&gt; 1. Standard ceramic coffee mug - nice, decorative, and fun for the   
&gt;    office or home use, but that's about it.
&gt; 2. Wide-bottomed plastic insulated travel mug, with lid. This also seems
&gt;    appealing for bus drivers. This will not tip over as easily, and has a
&gt;    lid so you can use it while enjoying your bus!
&gt; 3. Funky tapered insulated plastic mug, shaped to fit in standard skinny   
&gt;    car cup holders.(with lid) This also seems appealing for Bus use, but
&gt;    my bus, (split) and I don't think late models, have cup holders...
&gt; Also, a design must be chosen, between the Air Cooled Search &amp; Rescue   
&gt; Team, or the standard 4 bus Netvergnu:gen design, which would cost a bit
&gt; more, since it has more colors. A new design would be cool, but also cost
&gt; a bit more for new artwork production.

Why not do something in insulated stainless steel, sort of like the one
from the Vanagon catalog?  Seems more 'keepable' than plastic.
