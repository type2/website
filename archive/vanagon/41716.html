Subject: Re: Eurovan Catalytic Conver


&gt;&gt;&lt;this individual states that as a
&gt;&gt;     result of the catalytic converter being beneath the passenger
&gt;&gt;     compartment, it heats the interior of the vehicle
&gt;
     &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;But seriously, I haven't really noticed an increase in heat in the
&gt;compartment. I think the EV's are great, highly recommend 'em.

Maybe that guy had an aftermarket cat, that was missing a heat shield or 
something?
