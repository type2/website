&lt;&lt; &gt; I used Audi 5000 lug bolts on the front at $3.50 each.  They are a
little
 &gt; shorter 27mm instead of 31 or 32 mm for the $9.00 VW chrome bolts.  Works
 &gt; fine; it has plenty of thread to be safe and secure.

 That's good advice. I take it that these have tapered heads in stead of the
 normal rounded heads (that is the back of the head where it 'centers' in
 the wheel).

 &gt; You do not not need
 &gt; to replace the rear studs, not even sure if you have to replace the lug
 &gt; nuts, but I had the VW chrome ones for the back already.

 I got contradictory info on this. Some say you have to get longer lugs. The
 nuts do have to be replaced though as the standards do not fit properly
 because of the above mentioned tapered versus rounded backside of the nuts.

first of all junked Audi 5000's are so plentiful here in the US (thanks CBS
60 minutes!!)  (well, every yard near me has at least a couple..) that you
can usually walk into any junkyard and pocket 10 with the usual 5 finger
discount..  ;&lt;)
the Audi TURBO lug bolts and the NON-TURBO lug bolts are the same, both w/ a
17mm head, but same thread pitch and dia. as a Vanagon.

Audi lug bolts will work as a replacement for the front Vanagon Carat alloy
lug bolts, with the Carat Alloys, and will work when mounting Audi TURBO
wheels on the front of a Vanagon.

Now on the rears, when mounting Audi TURBO wheels you must use elongated
studs..sure you can put them on, but with the stock studs, the lug nuts do
not grab onto enough of the stud to be safe.. ( know someone who did not put
elongated studs on the rears with his turbo wheels, and he just cranks down
the lug nuts every 3000 miles or so....doable, but.....ya know...PITA)..

Now, when mounting the Carat alloys on the vanagon, you dont need to replace
the rear studs w/ elongated ones.
you need the VW Carat alloy rear lug nuts.
If there was a way you could mount the vanagon Carat alloys on the rear of
the vanagon with just using the stock steel wheel lug nut, then why do you
think they made the special nuts just for the alloy wheels??

so, if you have a set of carat alloys without lugs, then you may be able to
save yourself a few bucks by using Audi lug bolts up front, but you will
still have to get the VW alloy lug nuts for the rear.
