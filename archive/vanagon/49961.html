Octoberfest time up in Solvang, Ca. on the 5th. About 30 miles north of
Santa Barbara.
     One of the best shows and swap meet I've seen, a good time always
had by all.
      At Stevenson field on Hwy.246 between Buellton and Solvang.
 Solvang is a old Danish town with shops , windmills and a cobblestone
street.  Looks real good when you see all the old volkswagens along the
main street.
 More info. at the vintage volkswagen club Golden Gate web page. I don't
know the URL, but you could use a search engine like yahoo to find it.
