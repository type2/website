Yep,

I have one on my '83 thats for sale. It fits your description and is a
shiny chrome color with black print, real cool! Wish I had one on the '86
I'm keeping :-(  If you want to see a picture of the sticker, go to:

&gt; I have not seen them yet.
&gt; 
&gt; My understanding that they are simular to oval international country
badges, but instead of 
&gt; showing USA, D, ..., etc., these badges show &quot;VW&quot;.  Then, along the
bottom and inside the 
&gt; border, is &quot;Vanagon_at_lenti,med,umn,edu&quot; is printed in 3/16&quot; letters.
