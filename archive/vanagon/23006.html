Bob,
	Taps and dies.  We've gone through a lot of these cutting tools in 
Detroit.  Did you know that we were actively recruited by the Soviets 
during the cold war.  They need people who could turn big nose cones for 
mrvs ect.  I guess what I would say is to not turn the tool or work too 
fast and keep them lubed.  Gary Gibson
