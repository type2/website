Subject: FW: pop top trim / /  drain plug sizes

The tranny drain/fill takes a 17mm allen head (hex). It's in a very awkward 
location and I found a hex socket for a 3/8&quot; drive ratchet works pretty 
well. I couldn't use the drive because of the restricted space, but was 
able to turn the socket using a 17mm open end wrench. Major yoga exercise, 
but doable.
