This is looking good already - 5 vehicles have signed up!  

We even have a general area of interest, since two of our list
members will be in that neighborhood at that time ANYWAY.   That
area turns out to be around the vicinty of highway 101, somewhere
between Mendocino, and further north, like Eureka.

Do we have more suggestions as to pinpointing a locating in
this general area?

Sincerely,

your cruise director (yes, saddled with it once again)
