&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;I drove about 4 miles from work to that same darned bank machine, turned 
&gt; &gt;&gt;the van off briefly, and it refused to start again.  It sits there now as 
&gt; &gt;&gt;I wait for both of us to cool off.  Can anyone help?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I had similar experiences with my 84 vanagon in the last few months. 
&gt; 
&gt; I decided to switch gas!!! I switched from Arco to Shell. The problem hasn't
&gt; bothered me since then (for about 2 months now). Shell costs a lot more.
&gt; Ouch!!! It is about $.10 more per gallon here in San Jose.
&gt; 

I don't know about San Jose, but a bit farther north in the Bay Area, the cheap
Arco stations all sell gasahol, which is why they're consistently 10-20 cents
cheaper/gallon than Shell or Chevron.  I think our owner's manuals warn against
using gasahol.
