Subject: Re: Fiche to Paper

Has anyone thought of fiche -&gt; paper -&gt; gif/jpeg?  Even better fiche -&gt;
gif/jpeg!  But I don't know how to do that one.  I might be convinced to
scan it.  I've got an '89 westy and I have some fiche (thanks!) but it sure
would be handy to have it at my finger tips out on the net somewhere!

Let me know.

&gt;I have a microfiche at work with a copier attached.  I'm sure I could see 
&gt;my way clear to make a paper copy.
