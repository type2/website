&gt; &gt; ...                                                    I've always run my VWs
&gt; &gt; on el cheapo 87 octane gas with no problems, no pinging, etc.  Anybody that
&gt; &gt; puts 91 octane in the tank of a VW is just burning money, in my opinion.  Of
&gt; &gt; course, in the event that I am wrong, someone please correct me!
&gt; 
&gt; one thing to remember about OLD vw's is that the u.s. has changed its method
&gt; of labeling gasoline octane: what USED to be 91 octane in the &quot;old days&quot;
&gt; (back in the 60's) is NOW 87 octane. so, yes, VW's are designed to run on
&gt; the lower pump octane (87) that is available NOW.
&gt; 
&gt; but many people &quot;feel&quot; that the higher grades of gasoline give them more
&gt; performance, cleaner engines, less trouble, better smelling exhaust, and/or
&gt; whiter teeth. ;)  it's their money, their choice. :)
&gt; 
&gt; the point is that if you have an older VW and you read the owner's manual
&gt; and it says &quot;91 octane&quot;, be careful to look at which KIND of octane ...
&gt; usually it's &quot;91 RON octane&quot; which is the old way of figuring octane. the
&gt; new equivalent is &quot;87 (RON+MON)/2&quot; (or some folks call it AKI octane rating).

Excuse me Joel, but can you provide a source for this information?

It is contrary to everything I have read in the past.

Thank you.
