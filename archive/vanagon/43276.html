Subject: Re: Syncro Fan!!!


&gt;Several wasserboxer and diesel-vanagon owners on this list, have told
&gt;me that their cooling fans almost never come on-- just in long traffic
&gt;jams, going up long hills at high altitudes, etc.

Only once in the two years that I owned my '84 did I ever hear the fan come
on.  Being paranoid after requiring the obligatory head gasket repair shortly
after purchase of the vehicle (from a dealer, no less), I wired in a two
position switch to activate the fan manually.  I used the factory two
position foglight switch wired directly to the temperature sensor on the
radiator.  The time the fan came on automatically was one of the few times I
forgot to manually activate it.  Let me know if you need any info on how to
install this.
