Subject: Speedometer noise

My speedo cable is sticking and I want to lube it.  Does anyone know
what VW used in the '87 Vanagons to lube the cable.  I don't want to use
graphite if they used oil and vice versa...messy!  I'm too lazy to check
for myself and the van is in another state.  I want to find out what it
needs so I can fix it next weekend and get to the fun things...like
repacking my 8 CV joints.
