Subject: Re: CB Antennas and stuff

I use a magnet type antenna. I cut a hole just big enough for the magnet in
the roof rack so I can get down to bare metal.


&gt;We were thinking of hooking up the old CB on our next trip out with the 
&gt;'85 Westy.  Does anyone have any ideas for antenna mounting/locations.  
&gt;Magneticare out because of the fiberglass top.  Has anyone done any side 
&gt;or bumper mounts, if so how did it work out, and where did you run the 
&gt;wires.  Also, any good radio mounting ideas?  Thanks!
&gt;
