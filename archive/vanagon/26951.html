&gt;&gt;however, there is a fellow out in california that makes a LSD for the
&gt;&gt;vanagon transmission ... costs about $300 plus installation (you've got
&gt;&gt;to find some tranny shop that can do it.) it's not really hard to do
&gt;&gt;(according to the article in HOT VWs magazine) since you are only fooling
&gt;&gt;with the differential end of the transmission.  i can send you the name and
&gt;&gt;address of the guy if you want it.
