Subject: Re: Group-41 deep cycle gel-cel battery -payback

&gt;Here is what I came up with.
&gt;
&gt;Optima Deep Cycle Battery (not gel, new spiral wound technology)
&gt;52 amp hours
&gt;700 or 750 cranking amps


This is the battery of choice for 4x4 electric winching usage, dual Optimas
and high output (120-180amp) alternators.  Rapid discharge/charge cycles.
300-400 amp draws from the winches, discharged after a couple of minutes.
Lots of abuse.  Tim
