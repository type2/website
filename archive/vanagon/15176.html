&gt; For those of you EVers who haven't attempted this little task, its
&gt; quite easy! First off go to your local VW dealer and get a set
&gt; of plugs (about $4.00 a pop), I would suggest the stock one as
&gt; they are dual electrode types. Unfortuanately, IMHO, they are
&gt; made by &lt;gag&gt; Champion...
&gt; 
Always used Bosch Platinum or triple electrode in my Quantum
Syncro, since it used the same Audi 5 cylinder I figure they
would be a good and cheaper alternative, sometimes you can get
the 4116 Bosch Platinum on sale for under $2.00 each at auto
parts places, anyway lots better than the $15 each Platinums
in my Corrado.
