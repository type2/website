Subject: Repairs, WA...thanks

I wanted to thank everyone who helped out with advice on where to 
get my bus fixed.  I'm keeping it in Ocean Shores, Wash.,  which is 
about 20 miles east of Aberdeen.  What makes it difficult is that I 
live in New York City and bought the bus from my girlfriend's  
brother, who only had it a couple of months.  I've only seen pictures 
of it, but  from his description it sounds like all it needs is a new fuel 
pump.  If I'm wrong and it needs like, major work, I wanted to know 
where to take it.  Ocean Shores is about a hundred miles away from 
most of the places people recommended, but I guess that's not 
prohibitively far if I can get it running.  Still, if anyone knows of 
anyplace closer,  like around Olympia for example,  I would be 
grateful.  

Thanks again,  Evan E.
