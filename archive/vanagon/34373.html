&gt;I just had a shop check out my engine and they said that there is evidence
on
&gt;both sides of coolant fluid leaking and evaporating.  Their recommendation
is
&gt;to just wait until it blows as long as I stay in the USA.  When I mentioned
&gt;my
&gt;anual trip to a remote spot on Baja Coast they said definitly have the heads
&gt;done before going.  The engine is a 2.1 on my '86 Syncro Westy.  Any input
is
&gt;appreciated as they quoted me from $800 to $2000 for the job.

If only problem is external leakage, and it is a small leak, I would not pull
the heads.  Radiator stop leak will cure if used correctly.  Engine should be
periodically checked for internal leakage as this is cause of all sorts of
problems such as holes in pistons, blown readiators, heater cores, etc. Best
way to test is with leak down tester, then apply full air pressur to cylinder
with pressure cap reomved, Engine must be secured at TDC for this).   When
using stop leak,  I only run engine long enough to distribute sealer in case
and heads, turn off before thermostat opens.  Do this three or four times,
then let engine sit over night. This will keep sealer from cloging radiator
or heater cores.  I've repaired many Vanagons this way.
