Subject: vwbus driver survives head on

hello all,

	Just as a note to the &quot;how safe is a bus...&quot; thread, this
weekend on highway 26 here in portland a VW bus was involved in a head
on collision with another car.  The two people in the bus were fine,
the other driver did not survive.  From what I understand both
vehicles also caught fire in a major way, and it was the driver of the
bus who was at fault.  Figured someone may be intrested.

take care and DRIVE SAFE!
