Subject: New 23Window Horror Story...

I just talked to a friend of mine who was following up on some ads in the
November issue of the NEATO Old Bus Review.
There was a fellow who placed a &quot;Wanted&quot; ad for essentially any kind of bus
and was willing to pay or trade for firewood. It turns out that he ended up
with a '61 Westy!  The same guy seems to have a pair of split oval 52 bugs.
(Ho hum, everyone has a set of these- Don't we?)  That's the cool part.
My buddy was checking with him to see if he was interested in buying his '63
Hitler Hatch Westy with the rare full width icebox that's right behind the
drivers bench and under the weird rear facing seat... The fellow had already
purchased the '61 Westy for next to nothing.  As a conversational aside, the
fellow mentioned that he had just finished cutting the rear wheel wells on
his '60 23 window.
DOH!!!!! My friend double checked to see if he was kidding and was told,
&quot;No, I like 'em like that so I can put those big 'ol tires on them for off
road and hauling firewood.&quot;
HOLY SMOKES, NO WAY!!!!!
Crud, even out here in the mythical &quot;dry&quot; desert of the SW USA we can't find
early Westys and 23s that don't need a total redo or haven't been redone for
the requiste big bucks. This fellow has a treasure trove and is hauling wood
in them and stands within one brain cell of Bajaing the '52 split ovals.
Cripes! At least he  isn't a flag burner!!
I don't know about you, but I would support the next constitutional
admendment to prohibit stupidity. Only two factors would stop me. 1. I
support his right to be free enough to do stupid things. (although I wish he
wouldn't)  2. I think I would be in jail every other day.
The location and phone of this nameless individual has been omitted. If you
are on the list then I beg you to not turn any other treasures into wood
haulers or bajas!!! Grumble, grumble, grumble...
Just my $.02 worth on a true story which is NOT an urban myth or some
typical VanBondo B.S. (bus story) that I'm proned to post...
