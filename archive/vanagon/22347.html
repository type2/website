Scrap of as much flakey stuff as you can, it just holds water behind it, so 
get it all. Use a putty knife. Body shop guy told me to use plastic 
drainpipe solvent to wipe down the remaining tar surface to get fresh 
stickiness and seal up small cracks, then spray on fresh undercoating. Nasty 
fume laden job, wear a mask, hat, goggles and shave off all scalp and facial 
hair before hand&lt;g&gt; Throw away all the clothes you wore afterwards. 
Eveything get covered in tar mist after 6 or 8 tins have been blasted on. 
I'd use a rust preventative spray also. I usually do this before 
undercoating and give it a day or two to soak into the cracks/joints before 
tarring them shut. I have a 30 year old Porsche whose underside is in great 
shape. From California, climate helps a lot! tim s.
