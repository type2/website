&gt;I HAVE to tell my vanagon purchase story again.  I apologize to those on
&gt;the list who have heard it already.
&gt;
&gt;I had been shopping around for a Vanagon for some time, with mixed results.
&gt; None of the vans I looked at 'felt' right, and I wanted to find a van that
&gt;called to me.
&gt;
&gt;I had heard from another Vanagon owner about Hoch Motors in Marin, which
&gt;specialized in Vanagon Westfalia campers.  I called up and arranged with
&gt;Roy to drive up (2 hours away) and see what he had on his lot.
&gt;
&gt;On the way up I listened to KQED public radio, as I almost always do in the
&gt;Bay Area.  About when I was passing across the Golden Gate bridge, &quot;Car
&gt;Talk&quot; came onto the radio.  For some reason, I thought to myself &quot;I like
&gt;these guys.  If they talk about Vanagons, I'll listen to what they say.  If
&gt;they say they like Vanagons, it will be a sign that I should buy one.  If
&gt;they say bad things about Vanagons, I'll wait another six months and think
&gt;it over some more.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;The second caller was a woman who said &quot;Hey guys.  I drive a van and I'm
&gt;worried about looking frumpy.&quot;  &quot;What type of van, asked the Guys.  &quot;A
&gt;Vanagon camper&quot;, she replied.
&gt;&quot;Whoa, no problem&quot;, they said.  &quot;A woman driving one of those Westfalias
&gt;automatically looks hip!&quot;
&gt;
&gt;I bought my van.  And I love it.

Thanks for the retelling! If I had not already been going around with a 
big grin 
on my face this would have done it! &lt;G&gt;
