Subject: Re: Interior Camping  Heater

A friend of mine lives on his boat.  His only heat source is an electric,
&quot;oil filled&quot; space heater.  He drapes towels over it to dry them.  There
are no exposed elements, no risk if it falls over.  I had not seen one of
these before and was most impressed.  I believe they are easy to find but I
have not gone shopping for one myself.

&gt;With all this talk about heaters, could somebody recommend a small 120V
&gt;portable heater to warm the inside of the westy during cold spells at
&gt;the campground.  Something safe.
