Subject: Re: towing the vanagon

&gt;Well, gang,
&gt;Here's a fairly important question ... How does one tow an injured vanagon
&gt;say 1000 miles?  What special things will need to be removed?


You may be able to rent a bumper hitch from U-Haul that grips around the 
bumper edges, although the tin is pretty thin. Or bolt on something solid, 
2&quot;x2&quot; steel box tube say, in place of the bumper. (remount the bumper over 
it?). Anyhow, this could be done in the comfort of home, prior to leaving. 
As for towing 1000 miles, I don't know, perhaps disconnect the drive shaft 
CVs at the wheel side and tie them up snugly. This way the tranny doesn't 
get abused at all. Again, try this at home first to make sure you can get 
all the bolts out. 
I've trailered a car 900 miles, rear wheels on a car dolly, front wheels 
rolling on the ground. You'd get a pretty tall towed vehicle doing this with 
a vanagon. If you have to do this, check out the drop off charges on a 
one-way rental, cause towing an empty dolly 1000 miles would be hell on your 
nerves, and on gas mileage. What about rail freight? Returning car carriers? 
Or take out gold plated AAA membership that includes a tow home???  tim s.
