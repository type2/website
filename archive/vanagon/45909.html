Subject: 83' fuel consumption is UNREAL

        While returning from my long weekend bush adventure I noticed that
I was consuming fuel at a very increased rate. Granted I did have one more
passenger, my girlfreind, but she weighs about the same as the amount of
water we had consumed from the tank, so I know it wasnt that. I checked for
leaks underneath, thinking that I may have puntured a fuel line or some
damned thing, but it offered no greater insight. The hills were bad coming
home, but again, not a drastic enough change to account for the dimished
fuel. The trip home to Edmonton was about 300km, and I used almost 2 full
tanks. SOMETHING IS WRONG!
        I now turn to you for insight o' wise list members.

even broker and now more worried,

mike.
