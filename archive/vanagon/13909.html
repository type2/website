Friends,
    After posting my message about my sick '71 camper who needs a rblt.
and/or heads and rings, I realized (via Todd) that I had not said where I
live!! I live in Mass., south of Boston in New Bedford.
    Here's something else: I was reading s'more of John Muir's manual, and
re-read the Rap on compression. He states quite signifigantly that it is
important that this test be taken on an engine being powered by a strong
battery.......only after the test was done did I discover my battery was
without life. It was quite dead, actually. Could that, coupled with the fact
that she has not been subjected to a REAL tune-up (i.e. valve adj., timing,
etc...) be an affecting factor in the results of a compression test???? Ought
I be holding out some glimmer of hope? The guy I'd bought it from had said it
was professionally rebuilt only 17,000mi. ago, and I had just assumed he'd
lied to me when I got the results of the comp. test. What should I do now??
Anybody know of a good local shop who could help me out with a tune-up that
won't charge a fortune? 
Thanks again for all the responses!!
You guys are great!!
Rachel-----'71 Camper
