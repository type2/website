Subject: cold start strategies

BBBRRRRRRR!!!! Woke up to an eye opening -12F (-55F wind chill) in Nebraska
today. Not surprisingly, although it was a first, the vanagon would not
start, not even with the help of a neighbors running truck.

This cold snap is expected to last well into next week, so I am soliciting
advise from experienced cold-climate listees. What are some good strategies
for getting going on sub-zero mornings?

When I lived in Vermont (pre-vw), I would take my battery in the house on
cold nights and that usually worked, so that is probably going to be my
first course of action. 

All opinions welcomed.

Patrick
