	As some of you may recall, i bought this baby without title, so I had
to do some legwork to get my papers in order.  BTDT.  Then they lost them.

	So, on a whim, I went back today, with the reciepts for the certified
letters from before, to try to get it straightened out.  I got in line
at 8:05AM, got to the window at 8:20AM, and was done and left at 9:50AM!

	Well, we went 'round and 'round about how much I was s'posed to pay,
I got to the point were we were arguing about money, and she gets the
supervisor.  She comes up and sez &quot;I see you want to register this as a 
historical vehicle.  On what basis?&quot;  Huh?   &quot;'cause its old and I think
it a neat car&quot; sez I.  &quot;Well,&quot; she sez, &quot;I could see if it was '40 Ford
or a '50's vette, but I don't think this qualifies.&quot;  So I sez &quot;look, I 
don't care about your propensity for American boat anchors.  You aren't t
the one who decides whether ot not i can register this as a historical
vehicle.  Furthermore, I registered my last bus, which was a '67, as a
historical vehicle, and didn't have to face nearly the same amout of
hassle or incompetence!&quot;  She didn't have anything to say about that...

	So, its finally registered, and now I have to wait for the plates...

	In other news, I've noticed a feature with the clutch.  I was trying
to start it, and I noticed that when I turned the key, the bus moved,
but just a little bit, like someone leaned on it a little.  Hmmmm.  And
its also easier to start if I put the clutch in - like _way_ easier.
Kinda wierd.  Time to look at the clutch adjustment, I guess.

Until next time...

Thom
