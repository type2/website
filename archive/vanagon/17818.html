Subject: Re: rebuild, temperature, fuel injection, and crankcase seal


&amp;&amp;My engine runs warm - like 350-375 cylinder #3 temp (VDO guage).  Why is
&amp;&amp;this, right after a rebuild?  

My '70, with recent rebuild and VDO guage like yours, runs at 350-400, 
during the winter with the heat on going uphill on the freeway (55mph).  
Tends to run cooler in the summer, without the heat on.  

&amp;&amp;1- the box.  I have this tall (2 foot?) tools, parts box bolted to the
&amp;&amp;from of the roof.  He said that not only does it have bad aerodynamics,
&amp;&amp;but it bolks the air flow that goes to the air intake chutes.

Where is the box?  I'd like to add some sort of rooftop storage to my 
van--anyone have a solid, free-flowing (air-wise) box idea to share?

&amp;&amp;2- the engine seal.  My engine seal is about 2' short, and I happened to
&amp;&amp;leave the gap in the rear of the engine compartment.  (front is front)
&amp;&amp;Right above the muffler.  So when the engine doesn't get air from the 
&amp;&amp;chutes (See #1) it gets hot muffler air.

Yepper, that's critical.  Seal that beast anyway you can, it makes a 
whopping massive difference in your engine temperature.  No gas-sucking 
with the heat on, either.
