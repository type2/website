Subject: where to put the 100,000km on a type II?



&gt;Accurate reproductions of the badges issued by Volkswagen to owners whose
&gt;cars had passed the 100,000km mark... mounted to the front quarter panel and
&gt;the St. Christopher was affixed to the dash. The 2-inch aluminum disks are
&gt;adhesive backed.

Where were these placed on a type II?
