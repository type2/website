Subject:       VW Sand Rails - good fun!

One more thing about our trip - my b'day present was to go riding the 
dunes in Ore., but I discovered the only thing you could actually 
drive were some H*nda toy buggies... After pondering this, I decided 
to go on a driven tour in a *real* VW sand rail - what a gas! The 
driver was the owner who had built all the buggies himself &amp; knew the 
dunes inside out. Well worth the $25 /ea for a 1 hour tour imho. :))
