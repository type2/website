Subject:      Sachs Clutch Chatter

Hi all,

Over the past week I've seen some posts on chattering clutches -
specifically Sach's. According to my source the manufacture is recalling
their latest clutches because of the chatter problem. While there are
conflicting stories, one theory is the introduction of a universal
pressure plate. The previous models had separate versions for different
years of cars. They have now adopted a universal model that has the same
specifications for all years therein lies the rub.

Just thought you should know in case you'd like to check further.
Later,
DM
