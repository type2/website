Subject: Any NC VW Volks wanna do an outerbanks trip?

hey now,

any NC...or for that matter...anyone at all anywhere wanna do a vw caravan to
the outer banks sometime early this fall? i think the fall is one of the best
times for a trip to the outer banks and a nice flat trip would be great for my
vw once i get it legal and running in tip top shape. i'll be happy to plan such
a trip if there is suffecient interest in one. let me know.......

thanks richard for teaching and helping me to bleed the brakes. all you people
are great...let's get together and go somewhere everyone!

eta time for my van to be up and roadworthy (legal with tags that is...Monday
8/28..fingers crossed).

get in touch folks..

jonathan
