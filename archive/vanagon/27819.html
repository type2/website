Subject: Re: Great Deals On Inverters

In a message dated 95-10-27 11:44:47 EST, you write:

&gt;&gt;I have identified the PC600 Focus Industries model as the best value for
&gt;general purpose use. The prices are unbelievable. Here's what I see:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;PC 300 $55
&gt;&gt;PC 600 $158
&gt;&gt;PC 1500 $358

  These are not the best inverters in the world (to be generous).  They will
work OK with simple loads, such as shavers, battery chargers, and most
motors.  The ratings they give are not quite true also, as the continuous
ratings are less (don't have a current catalog, but I recall that the 1500 is
rated at 1000 continuous.)
   They will work if you don't need much of a quality waveform, but I would
not use them for any electronic equipment, such as computers.

--------------------------------------

I am mindful of Lauzon's comments and suspect they are true. I note,
however, that the Danmark catalog contradicts Lauzon, speciically saying
these units are good for electronics, TVs, VCRs, laptops, etc. I called the
manufacturer and the fellow their reiterated this assertion. The Danmark
catalog also flatly states that the PC 1500 is rated at 1500 watts continuous. 

Nevertheless, other list members have tested these units and report that the
waveform is not perfect but it does resemble a modified sine wave. These
other list members do state, however, that these units are optimistically
rated so I wouldn't be suprised if the 1500 watt model can only handle 1,000
watts. 

1,000 watts is quite a lot of power, however! The biggest power item I want
to use is a 110 volt air compressor with a high CFM rating. There are 12
volt air compressor units available, (see Granger catalog) but they cost,
like, $500 or something and don't have as high a CFM rating as 110 volt
units, which can cost $100.

The ultimate idea for inverters is to pay up big $$ (double or triple the
amount) and get a Heart Interface model but I'm going to try the PC1500
first. I suspect it will work fine for most purposes. 

Hope this information has been helpful to you all.
