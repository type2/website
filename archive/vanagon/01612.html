Subject:      Yes, Folks, it's Friday ...


ok, will ... now i KNOW you've been in Montana toooooo long. :)
however, in a fine gesture of Continuing a Useless and Boring Thread of
Email ...

&lt;to the tune of My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean&gt;

My Vanagon speeds down the highway,
My Brick-bat just flies down the street,
My Transporter rolls on the blacktop,
And I think it looks kinda neat!   :)

Cores:                                  &lt;Chorus, that is&gt;
Bring Back, oh, Bring Back,
oh, bring back my Buses to me, to me!
Bring Back, oh, Bring Back,
oh, bring back my Buses to me, to me!

My Camper can drive through the country,
My Camper can drive through the town,
It can reach up to speeds Quite Astounding
As long as I put the top down!

&lt;chorus&gt;

My Microbus doesn't roll swiftly,
If fact, it won't go very fast,
But it's still in one piece and still rolling,
So I guess it was built well to last.

&lt;chorus&gt;

My Bus can go over the meadows,
My Bus can go under the trees,
My Bus can surprise many people,
Cause I camp anywhere that I please. :)

&lt;chorus&gt;

My Split-Window scoots through the city,
My Microbus zooms round the place,
And it makes people happy to see it,
As it smiles at them with its big face.

anybody else?
&lt;i would have preferred a better Chorus, but that's all i can think of on
my current level of caffeine&gt;
