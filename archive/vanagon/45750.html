&gt; As Bo suggested following the old manual is a great way to go.

&gt; The one thing that I did in accordance to the manual was to remove the 
&gt; manifold, just as well.  On removal of the manifold I discovered a small 
&gt; crack (near the mount) around one inch long.....I DID NOT replace the 
&gt; manifold as the dealer suggested BIG$$$$$, I found a good shop and got 
&gt; it welded.  The shop in CA told me that they had do many Vanagon 
&gt; manifolds with the SAME DEFECT in THE SAME PLACE!
Which manifold are we talking about here?
 
&gt; So, you may want to check out the manifold thoroughly on removal, BTW 
&gt; the manifold FOR ME was the hardest thing to get off!.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps,
