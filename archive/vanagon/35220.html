Thanks for the heads up about the minor paint cracks on the A and B =
pillars. Sure nuff, hairline cracks in the paint at the top of the A =
pillars, both sides. I never even noticed.

You say VW will fix this for free? Any experience with Carters in =
Seattle? That's where I go when I need dealer attention. They took care =
of my piston slap condition last summer-no questions asked. Did a good =
job too.=20

What is a Sidewinder II awning? Where might I find more info about this =
product?

Thanks,=20
