&gt;At first, the parking brake would activate and hold only one wheel (the
&gt;left, I believe) but not the other.  Then the wheel that it would hold
&gt;was getting &quot;stuck&quot;.  This is not an overly complicated mechanism, or at
&gt;least it seems to me--he still has it and I'm getting impatient.  Any
&gt;suggestions as to what the problem may be?

it might be something as simple as somebody before screwing with the
adjustment. there is one cable coming from the parking brake handle. that
one cable is bolted to a cross-piece. and the two cables (one from each
wheel) are also bolted to the cross-piece.  so you can adjust each rear
wheel independently, and/or adjust the whole gizmo (by adjusting the one
nut on the cable to the handle).
it's possible that someone has messed up the 'balance' from side to side on
that cross-piece.
