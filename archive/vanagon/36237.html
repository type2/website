Subject: Re: Some basic questions

On Mon, 26 Feb 1996 thorsland_at_bigvax.alfred_dot_edu asked:

&gt; 1.  Will the transmission from a '73 fit into a '77 without &quot;much&quot; 
&gt; 	modification?

If I remember correctly, the '73 engine has a 210mm and the '77 has a
228mm flywheel. This also means that the bellhousings will be different. 
Fortunately, you can use the '77 bellhousing on the '73 transmission and 
thus won't have to replace flywheel, clutch and pressure plate.

&gt; 2.  Will your run of the mill spray paint work to paint the engine tin or
&gt; 	is high temp paint needed?

I haven't met a high temp paint worthy of its name. Might just as well 
use the regular stuff. Actually POR makes a good high temp paint, but it 
must be applied to *perfectly* clean and shiny metal, or else it _will_ 
come off.

&gt; 3.  What oil is recommended for my '77 westy?  I live in western NY.

I use synthetic oil (Castrol Syntec 5W15) on my '75. Pricey, but the
belief that it will withstand occasional bouts of high temperatures and
not break down makes me fell all warm and fuzzy. Moreover, the wide range
makes it an all-year, all-climates, oil.
