Subject: dogs on next CCC's trip


Kathy Myers (thanks again!) researched this for us, and here's what
she has to say:

&quot;Doggies are allowed! But there is a leash law in developed sites...
when the feds are around, at least. I figure that since we rented the
entire place, dogs off leashes won't offend other campers... so we
should see how the group feels about dogs running wild. If the Feds
show up, everybody HAS to put there dogs on leashes or they'll get
tickets.&quot;

I leave this to you dog-owners to decide upon.

BTW, Kathy says we will be able to have fires.  There may be 
a possibility to collect some dead wood there, but it may also
be picked over, so I STRONGLY suggest bringing yer own.  LOTS.
Magnesium optional  :)
