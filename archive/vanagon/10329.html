Joel,
Might b nice to just know the break out of the &lt;68's. Now Im not tryn to mess
up your columns,but I actually have a 21 window rag and ya dont see many 
of those around anymore. Guess I just want to see if any one can discuss
rag mechanisms or really sealing those pesky moon windows.

                                              Steve
