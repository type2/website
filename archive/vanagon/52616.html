From: &quot;R. A. \&quot;Pete\&quot; SELLERS&quot; &lt;sellersp_at_midmonet_dot_net&gt;
Subject: Seeking Dan Nichols

There is a person (Dan Nichols, I think) who keeps sending me messages 
asking for information.

He does not give me an E-mail address for a response.

The inbound message shows the following in the FROM category:

		&lt;yourlogin_at_stolaf_dot_edu&gt;

If anyone know this person please let him know that I've tried several 
times to respond and my messages keep getting bounced.

If he provides an adequate E-mail address, I'll try again.

Don't hear much from any of you so hope this start of the holiday 
festivities is pleasnat and that the whole period ends with warm and 
gratifying memories for all of you.

regards,

--
