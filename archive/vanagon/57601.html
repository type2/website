yes  but not for damages  just repairs    anyone out there with the resources
for a class action suit   it's a defect and we can't let them blow us off
 like this     they already set a precedent buy repairing them for the last
10 years       lets keep this going on the list     someone call Nader
 please reply on list not me personally for all to become involved        you
lucky few that did'nt have the problem  are rare  in the northeast just a
prolonged cold spell can cause the gaskets to shrink and leak
