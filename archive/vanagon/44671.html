&gt; After trying everything from using the OEM filter to replacing the sending
&gt; units I bit the bullet and installed a VDO oil press. gauge. Low and behold
&gt;I
&gt; have an actual oil press. problem. After  the van reaches operating temp.
&gt;the
&gt; gauge reads about 6-9 psi at idle and about 22 psi at highway speeds. This
&gt;is
&gt; after a so called reliable dealer assured me that the pressure checked out
&gt;at
&gt; 32psi.. What I'd like to find is what my options are. The van dosen't burn
&gt; any oil or smoke a bit, and it still gets about 18 mpg on the highway. We've
&gt; taken it on some 1000 mile weekends and it runs like a dream, should I be
&gt; concerned or just let it be? It has about 125,000 miles on it. &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;What viscosity oil are you using?  If you are using 10-30 or 10-40, that is
&gt;the problem. Especially with a high miles engine.  Try 20-50.  Make sure the
&gt;relief valave is not stickingand has the engine been maintained?  If it is
&gt;full of gunk, the pump inlet screen could be clogging.  I've seen this a
&gt;number of times.  The only cure id a complete teardown,(YUK).  Maike sure the
&gt;cooling system is working properly also and the the oil cooler is getting
&gt;water,  Especialy make sure the crankcase is never overfilled.  I have found
&gt;that these engines run coolest with the level between the marks.  1/4 inch
&gt;above the mark will drive oil temps out of control, even with an external oil
&gt;coler,
&gt;

Um, if I were in this mans shoes I would move right up to a straight 40W oil
for summertime and see if it made a significant difference.  I'd also dump
some teflon junk in to try and gain a little bearing life before they're
gone for good.
