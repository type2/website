Subject:       Fridge Flame Question (a bit a. retentive)

not that i'm obsessing on this, i mean it bugs me but it doesn't 
consume me.  yeah, i think about it each time i see the flame 
indicator.  i just keep wondering if it's normal.  could it be 
harming something?  i don't mention it to my wife but i wonder if she 
notices.  ya know, this is really starting to bother me...

&lt;if the above thinking ever goes through YOUR head seek professional 
help immediately.  it IS NOT normal.  unless you happen to subscribe 
to a certain VW list...&gt;

Here's my question:
&gt;From the flame indicator, i notice an orange glow in addition to the 
blue flame.  i assume this is from either the tip of the piezo electrode or the 
safety shut off.  do others see this in their flames (What Do You See 
in the Flame, Grasshopper?)?  Did i re-assemble something wrong?  
Help me out so I don't have to stew about this over the weekend!
