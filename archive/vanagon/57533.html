Part of those circuits are the 'sub computer' for the ABV located behind the
passenger side tail light (may also  need the original Digifant computer
located under the rear bench seat).

 there's no IDLE SPEED BOOST VALVE for the AC.  
&gt;Well, I'm going to call VW on Mon. and see how much the valve is.

Costs ~ $225 (!!!!)

&gt;WHERE does this elusive IDLE SPEED BOOST VALVE &gt;live on the Vanagon. 

Sits directly above, and feeds bypass air directly into, the intake plenum.
