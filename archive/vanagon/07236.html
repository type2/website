&gt; Stuart: How do you &quot;accidentally&quot; stick your key in the silver
&gt; socket.....? DC -- 
Well it's sort-of like going back in time about 25 years to the time that
ignition switches were on the dash.  I did this shortly after getting this
vanagon.  True, that's a very good question to ask, but if it can be done
wrong, I've either done it or am going to do it. :)
By the way, David, except for the close scrutiny by Canadian customs,
the trip to your country was (as has always been the case) completely
enjoyable.  I wonder if I fit into some kind of profile because I was driving
a vw camper?  Stuart
