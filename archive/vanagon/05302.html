&gt;&gt; About 1/2 of the messages on this list have no business being here as it is
&gt;&gt; merely mindless chatter from lonely people. I feel that Joel can post any
&gt;&gt; message he likes because he regularly contributes very valuable technical
&gt;&gt; information. Some of the other people are just blowing hot air into this
&gt;&gt; thing and it has the potential to drive people with real jobs and real lives
&gt;&gt; off the list.

Is your message mindless chatter? I'll confess, mine is.
 
&gt;&gt; Please don't generate traffic just to generate traffic. There are plenty of
&gt;&gt; places for that sort of thing in cyberspace.

It is usually counterproductive to complain about this type noise.  I usually
ignore these type posts but I may want to make a run for most frequent poster
so I need to keep my id in the ring.
