Subject: Westy questions

We just got this brand new '85 westy a few days ago and there are a 
couple of things I was wondering about.  

First I was wondering if there is any way to put in a AUX battery under 
the driver seat because I was looking through the shop book and could not 
find anything about one until '86.  

Second On the fridge I could get it to light and the flame indicator 
light would come on but I could not seeing a flame through the view 
window inside the fridge.  Is this normal?  It also was not cooling though.

Third is there a transformer or something for when you have it hooked up 
to 110v power to run the 12v items without runing down the battery?

Thanks a bunch in advance
