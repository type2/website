&gt;For some unknown reason the dipstick in my 85 sticks in the tube if it
&gt;hasn't been removed for a couple of hours.  The first time this
&gt;happened, I gave it a good yank and the bottom part of the dipstick
&gt;broke off at the upper notch and fell into the motor.  It took a while
&gt;but I was finally able to remove the 3 inch piece with a magnet after
&gt;unbolting the oil filler pipe from the block.  Some time later I
&gt;discovered another broken dipstick that the PO had stashed under the
&gt;front seat.
&gt;What could cause my dipstick to stick?
