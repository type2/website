Subject: Re: Gas heater boosters

I disagree with the comment about exhaust air being drawn into the heater
and causing it to smoke.  These heaters are nothing more than a big
carburetor.  The _have_ to be set up for altitude just like a Holley does.
You can't go by the VW manual on the amount of fuel the pump puts out, 
that's apparently for sea level.  When I adjusted my pump to factory spec
it pumped out huge clouds of crap.  I'm up in CO so the system has to be
leaned way down from spec.

If people are interested in what I've learned so far about setting the BA6
up, I'll write something up.
