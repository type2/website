Subject: Tranny drain plug (idiot factor content)

How critical is that little magnetic protruberance on the tranny drain
plug (87 Vanagon).  While cleaning it, I dropped it and the magnetic
post snapped right off at the base (idiot factor in real-time).  A new part
is a week away and I need the vehicle.  One VW parts guy said, no problem,
most of the metal filings stay suspended in the oil anyway.

Anyway, my plan is to go ahead and change the oil and use the busted drain
plug.  Meanwhile, I'll order the part and change the oil again at my leisure,
unless you folks think this is a bad idea.  Thanks for any advice.
