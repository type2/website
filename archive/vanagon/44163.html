&gt;To all of you bus owners with CBs, where did you mount them?  Please note the

I mounted mine under the dash to the left of the steering column.  It works
okay there, but the speaker is a little hard to hear at speed.  I can run
an extension speaker, or move the CB to the roof of the cab (would have to
build a custom mount for it - I believe Sami Dakhlia has done this), or
just buy a hand-held unit.  I'm thinking I will go with the hand-held
because of problems mounting a permanent antenna and it's just so darned
convenient!  I can use it in other vehicles and remove it when parked so
people won't be tempted to steal it.  Just some thoughts...
