&gt; &gt;didn't lee griffiths or someone 'on the other side of the pond' suggest
&gt; &gt;using rhubarb leaves??? rhubarb leaves are actaully fairly toxic (it is for
&gt; &gt;this reason that you don't compost them)

&gt; Now that's an interesting potion.  If I were to experiment with rhubarb
&gt; leaves, where does one get these?

These are native to Asia, but have been spread to North America, found
at your better farms and gardens everywhere. The stems of rhubarb are
good with salt or in the form of rhubarb pie! However, my Nature Bound
Pocket Field Guide warns: 

   The leaf blades contain oxalic acid and oxalates, and are poisonous,
   both raw and cooked. Ocalate level can vary, but at times small
   amounts of leaf blade are potentially lethal.

   Symptoms: Severe irritation and corrosion of the mouth, stomach, and
   intestines resulting in nausea, violent vomiting, and bloody diarrhea.
   Potential kidney failure and urine blockage. Other symptoms include
   headache, backache, difficulty in breathing, internal bleeding, con-
   vulsions, and coma.

I've also heard that it can cause mild cases of death in some people.

If you look for it in the wild, watch for a broad heart-shaped leafy 
plant with red or purple-shaded stalks. The leaves are crinkly and the
flowers can get to one or two yards tall, branching at the top. The 
leaves can easily be one to two feet wide. The flowers are kinda green
or white... we seldom let them get that big... rhubarb pie is tasty.

This beasty is a perennial, so you can make a patch out by a shed like
grandma did around my house... ;)
