There are to late bus opotunities in my neighborhood:

1) '72, blue &amp; white, $200 +/- &quot;Used to run, but then it stopped&quot;
owned by a young kid with a mechanical aptitude of -5

2) '76, orange &amp; white, $500 +/- &quot;runs, needs some work&quot; 
across the street from said kid.  Owner says the steering is a little
sloppy.  fair shape, a couple of scrapes.  I've actully seen this bus
drive.  Sounded like a muffler is in its future.

both busses don't have much, if any, rust that I could see just by taki ng
aquick glance.
