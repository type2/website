I've got a couple quick questions for you guys. I've got a '72 westy 
with (luggage rack in the rear) and I was wondering if you any of you 
have ever changed from the cot bed to the 2 man bed found in the '73-'79 
westy's. Is it possible to customise the later bed to fit into my bus. I 
could really use the extra space. My second question has to do with 
seats. I've got the stock low back seats right now, but I would like to 
put the full bucket seats with head rests into my van. Would they slide 
into the existing brackets, or are they mounted different? Does anyone in 
western Canada have any of these seats that they want to part with? Any 
suggestions are gratefully accepted.
