Subject: T-Shirts-The New Deal

Howdy all, and thanks to everyone who is now expressing interest in t-shirts. I
must ask all your patience, as I don't want to start selling off anything until
all my pre-paid orders are shippe which will be sometime next week. Once I've
taken care of all those, I'll take stock of what I have left, and put it up for
order. It looks like I'll have about 5 XXL Search &amp; REscue shirts, as well as
10 XL's and about 5 L's. I'll have about 10 of the Split Window design as well,
all in the XL size. Anyway, think about if you want one or not, but Please
don't write me yet.
Once everything else is squared away, I'll make an announcement opening up the
rest on a first-come, first-served basis.
Anyway, many thanks for all the interest. I'll hopefully get all the mailing
done once I get back from Alabama, assuming I can get all the ducks in a row
for that without going completely crazy.
Oh, thanks for all the HTML advice also. I hope to get all that straight ASAP
Anyway, happy Thursday
