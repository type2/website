Subject: Re: window rubber question

&gt;the rubber intact so I will reuse that.  The seal for the heated rear
&gt;window was destroyed upon removal so I will need a new one.  I see that
&gt;Rocky Mountain Motorworks carries the seal with molding groove for
&gt;$29.99.  West Coast Metric lists this same part as being unavailable,
&gt;but they do have the &quot;Cal-Look&quot; seal without the molding groove for
&gt;$18.00.  I would prefer the molding groove as that's what's on there
&gt;now, so how good does RMMW's rubber tend to be?  Is there anywhere else
&gt;that I could buy some quality rubber from for less?

I've ordered rubber from both RMMW and WCM.  The rear hatch seal from WCM
fit/looked/felt great.  I wasn't too impressed by the nonOEM engine
compartment seal they sent but for the price it will do the job for now (I
don't know a source for the OEM seal off hand).

As far as the rear window seal goes, I ordered one from RMMW about 1 1/2
months ago and it's still on backorder.  I called on friday and they have no
idea when it will be in (the one I ordered is without the groove for trim).
Out of 10 orders from RMMW I end up with back orders 60% of the time (clutch
cable kit, rear window seal, front tire cover, shifter lever kit to name a
few).  I don't often do business with them because of this.  If time is
important to you, be sure to ask if they have it in stock before you place
your order.
