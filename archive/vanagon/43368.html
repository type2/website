Subject: Bushings II

Well I found another use for the nylon star shaped bushings from the gasket
set that I asked about the other day. Tonight I reattached the fan housing
and contemplated what to do about the thermostat controlled air flaps and rod
that seemed to just rattle around loose without benefit of any holding
bracket. Jim at BusBoys had given me the vw part number yesterday to go to
the dealer with but I just didn't feel like it for a pair of $1 parts and the
time delay etc. Hmmmmm..What about those star shaped bushings? Voila, they
snap over the rod and fit in the fan housing perfectly. Add a touch of grease
and now the flap action is very smooth and easily held open by the spring.

BTW, those bushings, or whatever the original parts are called, were not the
only missing items. Also missing were 1/2 dozen tin screws, 1 of the four
bolts securing the transmission, two of the 4 bolts attaching the motor mount
bracket, the screw securing the ATF dipstick, the oil cooler bracket screw,
and several others. I came to realize that what all of these had in common
was their pain in the ass locations as well as being hidden from view. I'm of
the opinion that no PO with the energy to work on this thing would also have
been so careless whatever his ineptitude. Instead I belive this is the result
of a PO being hosed by some $50 an hour &quot;professional&quot; who cut the hard
corners.
