Subject:       Re: Drain Plug?  What's a Drain Plug?

&gt; looks to have been made this way.  Almost like somebody didn't get
&gt; around to drilling and tapping a hole for the plug.
&gt; 
&gt; The questions become:
&gt; 
&gt; - does this seem weird to anyone else?
&gt; - why would you want to have such a plate?
&gt; - would there be any harm in replacing it with a normal one (this is
&gt;   probably covered by the answer to the previous question)?

That's how my engine came as well.  No hole in the plate.  I've never 
bothered to get one with a plug in it.  I just undo the 6 studs and 
watch the hot oil run down my arm and splatter all over the place!
