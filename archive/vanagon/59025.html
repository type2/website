Subject: Successful Solo 1.9 Rebuild!

Hi All,

After rebuilding quite a few air-cooled VWs, I finally ventured to the
realm of Wasserboxers.  After much trial &amp; tribulations and helpful
advice, my efforts have shown to be a success.  It didn't appear so after
getting things back in my 84 GL, the Brownie Bus.  It refused to fire over
and over again, even after much cursing!!   Turns out I had the spark plug
wires off by 180 degrees.  After that it fired right up!  If anyone wants
more details on a home-based Wasserboxer rebuilding, I'll be happy to
share any information.  The satisfaction of that first drive after the
hours spent in the garage is a wonderful feeling.  8-)  Also, I'd like to
thank listmembers Fred Dyen for my inspiration to buy h2o Vanagons and
Kyle Wade for parts and advice, and of course the whole Vanagon list/
community for keeping me motivated on the project.
