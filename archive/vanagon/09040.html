Subject: Posting Sweepstakes

This business of the posting sweepstakes is really too much. We gotta think
about this one real hard before letting it go any further. Gerry had earlier
said he wasn't going to publish the sweepstakes winners to avoid encouraging
people to post needlessly. 

The list should be regarded as a precious resource for those of us with busy
schedules--a resource that can be abused by people posting every thought that
pops into their heads. I know how this is--I get caught up in it and I see
that I have seventh place in the posting rankings. But this is not something
I am proud of. If anything, it makes me wonder if all those messages I posted
were really necessary. 

The procedure ought to be: 

1. ENGAGE BRAIN
2. DETERMINE WEIGHTINESS OF MESSAGE
3. DELETE IMPULSES TO POST JOKES, IDLE COMMENTARY, ENTHUSIASTIC COMMENTS,
etc., EXCEPT AS AN APPENDAGE TO A REAL POST WITH REAL INFORMATION

The above rule would allow a lot of horsing around, but it would impose a
discipline on people to deliver the goods when posting. 

What are the &quot;goods?&quot; 

The goods are information and analysis that people can use to survive in this
world with the curse of VW Van ownership and/or obsession. Put another way, I
think we can all agree that Joel delivers the goods when he posts internal VW
technical documents, types in a Trailer Life article, or much of the rest of
the time. 

If message quality were uniform, then too many postings would not be a
problem. The problem is that a select few dilute the quality of this list by
posting with abandon. This is the age of information filters and the Vanagon
list is a supreme example of the power of the Internet to deliver incredibly p
owerful and targeted information. For a Vanagon owner in this country to
start getting mail on this list is nothing short of mind-blowing compared to
the isolation and dealer abuse suffered from the pre-Vanagon List days. But
the the value of the information filter goes down when it gets diluted by
&quot;noise.&quot;

Someone a few weeks ago suggested that perhaps a list like this is sort of
like a bar and that you have to expect a certain amount of bar talk. I
thought this was an interesting idea but I still come back to the idea of a
degraded information filter. 

I think the list had a higher average quality level last summer and spring
before some of the frequent posters started going wild. For you new people on
the list, you really owe it to yourself to get the postings from back then,
especially Joel's.

The idea of the /f indicator in the subject heading was a great idea somebody
came up with and I see that some are now using this. I love this idea as it
saves me a lot of time. For those who didn;t catch it, an /f symbol at the
end of the subject message in a post indicates that it is a messages posted
&quot;just for fun.&quot; I feel that anyone who uses this symbol should be allowed to
post any message no matter how silly, brief, inspired, or whatever. 

Now, I wonder if my message will cause someone to accuse me of being a
Control Freak and cause them to have a public psychotic episode on the list
before unsubscribing. (That *was* weird, wasn't it?)

Perhaps it would add something to repost father listmaster Gerry's take on
this sweepstake thing: 

Here is a post that I argue should't have been made (even if it is funny)
except as an ending to a substantiative post:

&gt;&gt; We can't catch Joel, but there might be a race for 2 &amp; 3 place.
&gt;&gt; Does this mean a sprint to the end of the year?
&gt;&gt; Keep your elbows to your selves!

Here was Gerry's response:

&gt;The last time you guys did this, you broke a bunch of things. Let's 
&gt;concentrate on keeping the list running, eh?  If this mess eats up too 
&gt;much of my resources (or the U's) it may be an ex-list.

Incidentally, the news that Macklow is planning to sell his syncro is
stunning. I find it stunning because he is poster number nine on the list. He
says he is burning out on paying so much on upkeep to keep his van running. I
had sort of assumed that we all knew our vans were not practical vehicles and
that we employed this list to make them more so. If you are leaving us, Jim,
then I am sorry to see you go.

I wonder if someone could sign up for the list and become so terrorized
reading about hundreds of possible repairs and modifications that they would
immediately decide to sell their van?
