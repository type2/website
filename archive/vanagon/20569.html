Subject:  play in slider door handle 

last night i attempted to see what the deal was with my slider handle
before it got any worse or broke.  it has much play in two planes, both
toward the vehicle (enough to scrape the paint, which is what the
previous owner did) and vertically, so the handle hangs at a 45 degree
angle.  i attempted to tighten the bolt which seemed to tighten the handle,
but when i used it again the play reappeared.  there are a couple of
washers under the bolt head which don't seem to be stock.  if i take tham
out and tighten the bolt, the handle won't move, as it is too tight to the
body.  before i rip the assembly apart, i thought i'd ask if i am missing a
crucial piece/clue here?  has anyone had a similar problem?
suggestions?  thanks very much.
