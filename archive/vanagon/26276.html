Subject: Re: Oh no, the dreaded leak

&gt; Opal helped me find a leak i never knew existed. somewhere on the front left
&gt; site..prolly the seal. i'm looking into replacing the seal but what can i do
&gt; until i can get the time and stuff and decent weather to do so....will
&gt; sillicone seal it well for a temp. fix? that's what i've heard. i was driving
&gt; down I40 and felt water hitting my leg. after all the rain stopped i noticed
&gt; that the carpet is wet and now i've got that great wet smell in the van. need
&gt; something to stop it until i can get the seal replaced. any ideas?

It is o.k. as a temporary fix, but it can trap water under the seal and 
cause serious rust over time.  I'd replace it as soon as possible.
