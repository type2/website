Subject: 84 GL Weekender Needs Good Home

I'm throwing in the towel on my beloved 84 GL.  I've spent more time looking 
at it's underside than looking out the windshield.  I'm trying to get an 
idea if there's anybody out there that might be interested and also trying 
to determine what she's worth.

Here are the vitals:
What's broke:		  Clutch in-op - slave &amp; master OK
					  Tires mucho miles - must replace
					  Exhaust - need front pipe, connector,
					  muffler &amp; tailpipe (have Parts Place
					  catalog)
					  Odometer - Around 150K 
What's fixed:		  Head Gasket right side 1991
					  Power steering rack 1989
					  Water Pump 1993
The Cassette deck drive belt is broke, have replacement radio/deck.  Body is 
above average for this part of country.  Vehicle spent early years in VA 
before move to Ohio.  Interior good, been thru three kids and a lot of 
interesting trips, but always garaged.  The Engine runs fine, just need that 
clutch so that you actually watch the scenery go by. I'm located in Dayton, 
OH.  Would appreciate any thoughts. Just don't want to let it go to the 
crusher or a yard, it desrves better.
