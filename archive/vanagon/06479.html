I've bitten and bullet and so should the rest of you who plan to
attend Pfeiffer Big Sur Jan. 6, 7, &amp; 8.  The only way to make
reservations is to call mistix at 1.8.. 444.7275.  Have your credit
card and a pencil and paper handy.  They are gonna ask you lots of
stuff, and tell you lots of stuff you have to remember.  First,
make sure you are not going to change your mind, because the 
reservations are pretty unrefundable.  They may be partially 
changeable or partially refundable, but you'll lose something,
and it seems like it will be a lot of red tape.  After all's
said and done, they'll mail you a voucher via snail-mail, plus
on the phone give you a reservation #, in case the vouchers
get lost in the mail.  With that number and a photo ID, you're
supposed to be able to get in.

Things:  group sites are NOT available at this time.  They will
put us in individual sites, none of which as I mentioned have
hookups (= bring batteries + dress warm!).  Now comes the tricky
part:  all we can accomplish by making these reservations is
guaranteeing the positive space in the grounds, rather than
the specific site location.  However, I spoke directly with
the people at Pfeiffer, who don't expect it to be a problem
for us to get adjacent sites at this time of year.  Their
check in time is officially 2 p.m., but they say at this
time of year, there's no problem admitting people early, and
they said to just have the first person arriving to tell
them at the entrance that they are the beginning of the 
vanagon group, and for everyone to have the list of names
of everyone else in our group, and they will put us side
by side.

More tricky stuff:  per site, there is allowed technically
one vehicle, but one additional vehicle may be added for
an extra $6 (the first vehicle is included in the regular
fee, which is, I think $14 for one nite.  There may be
some extra surcharges for this and that, including mistix
(which is unavoidable), and there is a $1 extra fee per
nite for pets - must be leashed).  Anyway, max. # of vehicles
per site is 2, and max. # of PEOPLE per site is 8, so
there can be some doubling up here for people who want to
be &quot;close&quot; and/or save $$s.  I'm sorry this gets complicated,
but will try to make do, and hopefully the lack of visitors
in the park at this time will make our goals of togetherness
easier to achieve.  

More:  showers cost extra, although no one could tell me how 
much.  Bring cash, a lot of these places don't take checks,
and some don't even like plastic.  Firewood is available
there for about $6.  

For the vanless:  you can come along, too!  Call the Big
Sur Lodge and stay there!  Their number is 1.800.4BIGSUR,
and it will PROBABLY cost around $80-100 per nite to stay
there, but this price is just a guess and not official.  

Check out time is 12 noon, so I personally made reservations
for Friday and Saturday evening, guessing that we would 
all begin to disperse around noon on Sunday.  Also assumed
that most of us would be arriving on Friday afternoon and evening.

Anyway, call mistix and make your reservations, and remember
to arrange doubling up if that's of interest, which I assume
it is in our case.  If you wish to talk to someone at the
Pfeiffer park directly (remember you cannot make reservations
that way), you can reach them at:  408.667.2315.  

If anyone needs more information from me, you can contact
me via email or by phone (below).
