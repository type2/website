Douglas:
Just ran across a lot with dozens of Vanagons/loafs/bugs. They were just
north of Fort Bragg. Called:
A-B Auto Sales &amp; Garage
phone 491-1835
I did not have time to check them out very well but there was a bug
getting a new headliner in one bay and a westfalia getting some engine
work in an other.
Good Luck
