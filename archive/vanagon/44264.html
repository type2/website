That was wonderful and exactly what I was looking for!!! Thanks!

&gt; 
&gt;         Does you van have a diesel auxiliary heater? If so, I have a
&gt; few comments I'll make, on that conversion back to gasoline.
Nope. No diesel aux heater.

&gt; 
&gt;         Transfer your fuel pump over from the '84. The diesel doesn't
&gt; have electrical power for the gasoline fuel pump, I don't think.  I
&gt; suppose you can block off the diesel fuel return fuel line, as you
&gt; won't need that for the gas engine, will you?
Yes, as a matter of fact the way the fuel pressure regulator works is that
it sends some of the fuel down a return line to keep the pressur right.

&gt; 
&gt;         I suppose you will be selling the motor and tranny from the
&gt; diesel?
Yup!  Know anyone who might want them?
THanks again!
