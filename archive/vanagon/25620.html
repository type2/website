Subject: RE: Porsche Power (was: Self-Introduction)


I was wondering, what would it take to put a Porsche motor in a 72' to 
79' bus? Is it possible?

My old trusty VW mechanic put a desel (sp?..its been a long day) out of a 
dasher in a 77' mint bus.  I wonder where he put the Radiator, etc....too 
bad he left town before I could see it finished.

Dave,

(thanks to all for the winterizing suggestions)
