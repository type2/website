VW's ads of that period were still done by DDB. Their ads were
&quot;witty&quot; but not &quot;controversial&quot;. The language was essentially
poking fun at Teddy, and had absolutely nothing to do with
the car itself. 

The NL issue hit the stands, and VW and Teddy tried to enjoin the
sale of the issue, but the US District Court (NY district?), and
the US Court of Appeals basically refused to issue an injunction.

One of the only times that a DDB/VW ad actually used a celebrity
was with Marty Feldman, and they got Marty's permission to 
use his face in the ad...they gave him a beetle.

Another thing that I recall about the NL/VW/Teddy Ad was that in 
law school, the appellate decision was used as an illustration
of 1st Amendment and satire, etc.
