well, i don't know why, but the address for me SHOULD be
jwalker_at_ua1vm.ua_dot_edu
which is what i THOUGHT it was putting out. it's probably some tables
somewhere that don't have the short ua1vm version (yeah, like EVERYBODY
knows ua1vm is alabama!). so i'll leave the name field like it is above
until i get wake up one the system nerds to tell me how to fix this.
