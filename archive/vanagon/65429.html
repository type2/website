&gt;I have an '88 with the exact symptoms you describe. With one additional
&gt;feature. If I blip the throttle sharply up to about 3500 rpm I can get the
&gt;idle to drop to 1000. I'm taking it to a local mechanic tomorrow, as I
&gt;don't have the time to fiddle with it myself - but the mechanic said that
&gt;often the throttle butterfly gets coated with carbon and then does not
&gt;close easily - hence high idle. I had already checked the idle stabilizer
&gt;and cleaned that out - so I'll know tomorrow what the verdict is.

More likely is that the bearings and/or the butterfly shaft that rides in
the bearings of the throttle housing have become worn.
