Now, to start off with, I _know_ that people can do what they want
with their cars, et al, but I'm kind of a resto guy myself..

Anyway, there`s this guy here in Sacramento that has done 
the unthinkable to his '54 barndoor standard:

He lowered it, to the ground.  Put in a bug transmission and
some type of adapter thingy.  Cut and turned the front beam.
Took the 16&quot; wheels, and had them cut and widened, to 6&quot;
in the front, 8&quot; in the back.  He's running 40 series rubber.

This is the same guy who, when I told him he was missing
his fresh air tubes (different bus) said &quot;So?&quot;
