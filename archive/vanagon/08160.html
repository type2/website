Last summer I stopped for propane in Williams lake B.C. The store had many
propane accessories, including a propane fired engine heater. It was about
the size of 2 beer cans end to end and is plumbed into the engine's
cooling system somehow. It was kinda like an &quot;on demand&quot; gas water heater.
I cost about $300, I wish I had got more info.
