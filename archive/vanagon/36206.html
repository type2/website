Subject: Re:  Horn wire connection to steering column

&gt;
&gt;There is a brown wire with a female spade connector dangling
&gt;near the steering box.  This is supposed to connect to a male
&gt;connector that is very hard to get to.  I could not see the
&gt;male connector at the base of the steering column from under
&gt;the car.
&gt;
&gt;I tried to gain access from inside the cockpit by removing 2
&gt;screws that hold down a metal plate.  The steering column has
&gt;a plastic sleeve around it to prevent grounding to the metal
&gt;plate and the frame.  The metal plate seems to be held onto 
&gt;the steering column by the plastic sleeve.  I know the connector 
&gt;is &quot;right under there&quot; but I could not get to it from the inside 
&gt;of the van.
&gt;
&gt;I did not want to bust the plastic collar to get at the connector.
&gt;Intuition tells me that part is either obsolete or expen$ive.
&gt;There must be a trick or special tool that will allow access or
&gt;removal of the plastic sleeve.  Do you squeeze it and then slide
&gt;it up the column or something?
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know the trick to reattaching the brown wire?
&gt;
Hmm.  I'm pretty sure you DON'T want to take that plate/column/collar thing
apart, as it's kind of hard to get back together with the column in the
bus.  I believe, though, that in answer to your question that the plastic
collar is split longitudinally (sp?) and you can squeeze it together
slightly and then pull it up out of the plate.  But I think it's got a lip
on the inside of it that prevents it from sliding up on the column.  As I
said, it's best to avoid taking that apart.  It IS hard to get to the
connector you mentioned, but not THAT hard.  I believe that the connector is
attached to the metal plate you see inside, the one that's held to the floor
by two screws.  You should be able to put the wire on from underneath without
taking anything apart.  You need to turn the wheel slightly so that the
steering coupler (discussed some last week) is positioned such that it's
not blocking access to the male connector.  Hope this helps...
