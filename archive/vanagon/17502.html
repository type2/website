There should be no need to butcher your bus.  The stock 78 have scoops built
in when compared to the Earlies.
I spent money, added things (oil cooler) and gotten Zero reduction in  Oil
temp.
Is your engine overheating?
Try a Gene Berg Oil temp dipstick.  Less than $10.and 30 Seconds to install.
(90 seconds if you use a stick to hold up your engine lid.)
Listen to that wife.
