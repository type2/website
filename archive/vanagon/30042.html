Subject: Dash brake light

The dashboard brake light on my '87 doesn't work.  I checked the
obvious....the bulb and the fuse and both are ok.  Any ideas? I'd wait to
drive with the parking brake on since I just had the rear brakes redone.
 (The light wasn't working before the brake job either.

Thanks in advance
