&gt; Another observation....some cars have built in sensors, especially
&gt; the later computerized types. One sensor is attached to the 
&gt; steering wheel, and measures the amount of moisture on your
&gt; hand, the stiffness of the grip and your pulse. The other
&gt; sensor is on the back of the front seat, It measures your
&gt; respiration rate, and quantity, and the amount of sweat
&gt; eminating from your back.
&gt; 
&gt; When the moisture, pulse, and respiration increases the computer
&gt; in your car's engine management system goes into anxiety mode.
&gt; The computer then references its own internal records regarding
&gt; repairs, oil change, praise, nasty words, etc. It manipulates
&gt; this information to arrive at a &quot;treatment&quot; value. If the
&gt; treatment (or sometimes called respect value) value is low
&gt; and the anxiety measure is high, the  computer goes into
&gt; a &quot;F.Y.&quot; mode and shuts everything down. This renders
&gt; the car undriveable.
&gt; 
&gt; The only solution is to heap money at the car until the computer
&gt; goes out of &quot;F.Y.&quot; mode.
&gt; 

I always thought that the sensors were tied to a module that was 
a receiver which got binary messages over that airwaves that 
were transmitted from your bank.  The car always new exactly
when you had a large unexpected amount of money that you had
other plans for.  Somehow it is even able to pick up these binary
messages even though you hadn't deposited the windfall.  Be aware
that these sensors are also installed on large appliances and in
all parts of your house.  If you have kids, the number of sensors
is quadrupled and the dollar amount is at least doubled.
