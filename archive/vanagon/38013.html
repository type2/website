&gt; Now on to the meat: I'm looking to buy a double cab, preferably a 68-71. Thom
&gt; Fitzpatrick has already been helpful in evaluating some JPEG images of a '65

Wow! You got Thom to talk about a lag-wagon?  I'm impressed! ;)

&gt; I'm willing to travel to pick this beast up, and I'm ready to trailer if need
&gt; be. Anything within a weekend's drive of the San Francisco Bay Area should be
&gt; considered fair game (I guess that means the entire Left Coast).

I've been through this before.  Up periscope!  :)
