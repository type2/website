&gt; well you have certainly taken it to a new level of detail dave! i was
&gt; referrring the info. more on a choice of appropriate beds than anything,
&gt; but i do enjoy reading a more detailed account of westy's through the
&gt; years. Somebody should really create a book profiling the evolution on the
&gt; various incarnations (Westy, Dormobile, Devon etc.) yjrough the years. I
&gt; know i would buy a copy!
&gt; 

 I hope I haven't bored anyone with trivia. I ended up knowing more about this
 that I would have otherwise liked on account of having three kids. Most 
 Westfalias built since '76 only have seatbelts for a family of four - hence
 my more detailed survey of camper layouts and their passenger accomdations.

 I think a book on this is great idea. The last chapter of the &quot;VW Bus Custom
 Handbook&quot; has some info, but it has better coverage of what was available 
 in Britain and there is no mention at all of some of the US built campers
 like Safari, ASI or Country Homes.
