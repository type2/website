Subject: Re: Cargo Hauls

Actually found a few minutes to read the list (over 14M of unread digest
messages saved now).  Forwarded Bob's Epic URL to some VW buddies...

The Bozobus has carried more than his fair share of heavy and weird.

Brought my new Honda CB400T home in him in '82.
A 72&quot; long sofa hanging out both sides, with the trailing doors back
        against the sides and the leading doors acting as air-brakes.
An 8'x 8' pathology table with the top split in half and the base on
        the roof; the top stowed similar to the sofa (about 800lbs)
A five-foot-cube of Rice University yearbooks, plus five people to
        help move them.  What does heavy paper weigh?  This was
        probably the heaviest load he's ever carried; it was almost
        impossible to steer.  Somewhere around 2000-2500lbs.
Towed a Datsun 240 250 miles to Dallas on a towbar.
Towed a Toyota Tercel 90 miles to Houston on the towbar.
Towed Bertha and Frunobulax all over on the towbar.
An upright piano (inside).
Two Honda 600s (cars) to the scrapyard (separately, on the top); check
        it out at http://techie.phys.sfu_dot_ca/Volkswagen/jgladu.html
The interior completely stuffed with household stuff, towing a U-Haul
        4'x 8' open trailer with a refrigerator and other household
        stuff, with the roofrack lined  solidly with 2x4s and 2x6s
        (50&quot; divided by 1-1/2&quot;, minimum 8' and max of 20'), and topped
        with a 1/4-scale chicken-wire and papier mache Tyrannosaurus
        (5' high and about 10' long).  I was too tired to snap a picture.
...or just Quilla June, bolted to the top, with a Santa hat on and
holding Rudolph the Red-Nosed Rein-Moose's reins...
