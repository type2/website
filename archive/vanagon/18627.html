This was originally &quot;Ottawa Pizza Night&quot; but has now turned into a two
fold mission.  There seems to be a VW show coming up in Embrum, just East
of Ottawa, in August.  Markus tells me it's August 16th but he may mean
19th as the 16th is a Wednesday.  Anyways we can verify this.  There is
free camping available soooooo......  why not make a get together of the
Listers at the Embrum show ?  All of you interested please contact me and
I will get things organized.  Meanwhile back to the original Pizza or Ice
Cream night plan.  Any of you locals or non locals if you want to come
E-Mail me your ideas as to place and when and I will try to coordinate
this thing.  There's always the Monday night car show in the parking lot
of Canadian Tire at Bank &amp; Herron.  Meet there and go for Pizza and or Ice
Cream afterwards ?  Just another idea.  

Cheers

Frank
