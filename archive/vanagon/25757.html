Subject: 1960 Double Door

A local fellow has a 1960 double door sans windows and engine (some kids 
smashed most of his windows out). Supposedly, it's in pretty good shape, 
but starting to get some rust around the rain gutter. I haven't seen it 
yet, but I talked with his wife and she described it to me. He's a VW Parts
shop owner, so he probably knows about what it's worth. Anyway, he wants 
$1500 for it as is...whatever that turns out to be. Apparently, the 
guy's not in a great hurry to sell and that's good because my interest 
and my wallet don't agree right now. I'm guessing I could talk him down 
some, but probably not lower than $1200. Don't know; just guessing.

Anyway, I'm holding off no matter what you volks say, but I was curious 
about the degree of rarity for 1960 double doors. I was born in '60 and 
always wanted a vehicle from '60...a VW bus of that year would be the 
ultimate!

Your insights appreciated.

Thanks! Joe
