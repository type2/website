&gt;I lost the freon (R-12) charge in my 88GL and decided to recharge it with
the
&gt;R-134.
&gt;I had an old vacume pump (the old high school demo kind purchased from a
flea
&gt;market) with which I evacuated the system.  I made fittings to connect to
the
&gt;ports on the Vanagon system from pieces of hose that I had and common
&gt;fittings that I bought at the auto parts store.  Once evacuated, I put in 4
&gt;(48 oz) cans of the new  R-134
&gt;and 2oz of compresser oil [USE SAFETY GLASSES!].   The manual calls for 50oz
&gt;total. This was done with the engine running the air conditioner set to
high.
&gt;It works great - can't feel any difference in cooling power.  Total cost =
&gt;less than $50.

The 134A is not compatible with the refrigeration oil that was in your system
 In about 6 months to a year your entire AC system will be trashed as the oil
gums up and clogs the works.  This type of situation is why there are laws
concerning the use and disrtribution of CFC products.  Also, the 134A is more
&quot;active&quot;  than R12. This means that your hoses will allow more to leak
through.  Different hose materials are used in 134A instalations.  This is
one of the components that adds to the cost.  

BTW, people trying things of this nature is why it will soon be neccasary to
have a license to mount tires.
