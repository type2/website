Subject: HELP! Power for fan?

Since it's about 90 here on a cool day I thought I'd get around to 
installing the &quot;Poor Man's Air Conditioner&quot; fan I ordered a while back. 
Have it installed (I think) and I need to know where I can find a home 
for the push-on connector that provides power to the fan.

It's a piggyback push-on connector, the push-on clamp is not wide enough 
to go onto one of the fuse holder arms (there are no other push-ons there 
btw).

The ONLY place I can see to try the push-on connector is on a small 
(maybe 3&quot;) silver box tucked under the dash left of the steering wheel on 
my '76 Campmobile. What the hell is the silver box, and will anything 
major explode if I try and push on the fan power connector there? Yes, I 
am clueless. The sun set before I could try this tonight.

Full review of fan and choice commentary of companies that use cheap shit 
parts to follow (once I no longer find myself roasting alive _at_ stop lights).
