Subject: the bus that goes *ping*

From: Dieter Dworkin Muller &lt;dworkin_at_village_dot_org&gt;


The Gerbil has developed an interesting, nay, disturbing little quirk
in the last few days.  Whenever the steering needs to be cranked
around while not rolling (say, during a three-point turn), the
steering column emits a moderately-loud *ping* just as the rotation
starts.  It does it once, and that's it for that turn.  The next full
rotation (say, a six-point turn) will do it again.  I don't have
enough data points yet to know if it's only happening in one direction
or both.  However, I definitely find it distressing, as I'm getting
this picture of the *ping* turning into a *snap*, and having half a
steering column in my lap....

Ideas?
