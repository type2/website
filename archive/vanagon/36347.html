If you're handy with a soldering iron, pop open your ECU and look for
poorly soldered connections.  Cold solder joints on steel-leaded power
resistors in the ECU seemed to be responsible for the problems Don
Lancaster had with his early-model Syncro (described in his article from
Electronics Now from Jan. or Feb. 1995) and which he fixed by simply
re-flowing the solder on those joints.

Another cheap possibility: new Bosch plug wires - replacing these
solved hesitation problems in my '77 FI system.

Presumably you're putting known good gas in the tank?  If not, try a new
tank from the cleanest, shiniest station in town and add a bottle of
Chevron Techron to boot - got whatever it was out of a bad tankful I had
in my '89.

&gt; This is turning into the Million Dollar Van.

Come on, you haven't replaced any *drivetrain* parts yet! The really
expensive fun has only just begun ;-)  Good Luck!
