&gt; 	I too am preparing to stick non VW issued grease into my CVs. I have
&gt; chosen a few tubes of Vavoline Premium Grease (I guess this used to be called
&gt; special moly grease but has been repackage because the part number is the
&gt; same). On the back is the make up of the grease, and its percent lithium soap
&gt; content (I think, this is all out of my memory from looking over the tube
&gt; in the shop three weeks ago). Does anyone know the base of the VW stuff? I
&gt; have seen the 1 billion posts about any MoS2 grease is great, but never have
&gt; I seen any comparision of the make up of these greases... Anyone know where I
&gt; might find the make up of the greases, compile a little list and stick it
&gt; somewhere for all to see?

     Dave and CV joint packers,
     The Grease I use is &quot;sta-lube&quot; Extreme Pressure, part number 3141.
     The main makeup is Moly-disulfide. In small letter on the can
     it states for CV joints. You can get it at Trak Auto stores.
