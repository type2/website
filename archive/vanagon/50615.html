RE:	Copy of: Re: Bus drivers and waving.

There is, (and always will be) an &quot;animosity&quot; that some aircooled drivers feel
toward the watercooled drivers. The watercooled Vanagons are not in the same
&quot;cult class&quot;  as the aircooled buses. I've been ridiculed by a couple of my die
hard splitty friends for having a watercooled vanagon.  They tell me to &quot;drive a
real bus&quot; and would sooner give the middle finger to a vanagon driver who waved
at them. This is why if I were driving my Vanagon, I wouldn't even bother waving
at aircooled buses, but if I were driving my '77 or my '67, I would.
Aircooled bus drivers have sort of a &quot;cliche&quot; (sp?) that watercooled Vanagon
drivers will never belong to. It all stems back from the whole &quot;simple&quot;
aircooled bus, easy to work on, etc and the people who drive them everyday, as
their daily driver.  To some diehard aircooled enthusiasts, the Vanagon does not
imply anything &quot;simple&quot;, and they percieve the drivers of them are more of the
professional ( ie. &quot;yuppie&quot;) / don't do any of their own work- types.
Believe it or not folks, this is true ,and you know it.  THIS IS NOT MY OPINION,
I am just stating the facts. This list split into seperate aircooled and
watercooled lists, right? Some shows I've been to have been aircooled only shows
- no waterpumpers allowed.
(just to set the record straight- I have a '67, a '77 and a '87  VW vans , so I
am not biased to any which one, regardless of body types or engine cooling
methods. )
While I completely realize not all aircooled drivers feel this sentiment, it
does exist, so unfortuneately air and water will never really mix.        That's
just how it is, and that's a reason vanagon drivers don't get many waves from
the aircooled bus drivers.
