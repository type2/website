A stiff crosswind in falling snow is indeed hypnotizing. I damn near drove 
off the highway once when my senses told me to follow the direction the snow 
was going. The long ridge of snow on the roadside that stuck up through the 
drifting stuff told me I was headed off the road at a very gentle angle, but 
at about 60MPH. This occured while wide awake, free of consumables etc. 
Don't look at the snow on the road, look way up ahead. Night time makes this 
a very dangerous condition, little time for recovery moves.          tim s.
