Subject: Need a favor (Strange)

Dubbers:

I have a strange request:

I am getting marrried at the end of August, and I talked my
fiance to let me put a bug on top of the wedding cake, under
some conditons:

Between 5 and 10 inches long.
Convertible
Bride and goom in the front seat, either driving.
Can be a Ghia.

If anybody out there has something that will fit the bill, please
contact me. I will pay all shipping, both ways, and take
real good care of it. I promise.

Thanx.
