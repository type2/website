Hey Jim,  
 I second what Eug said about the preventative procedures.  Also, I 
strongly recommend that you check your compression and adjust your
valves to exactly .006&quot;.  I blew an engine within 400 miles once 	
because #4 valve adjuster was loose.  It blew in O'Fallon Ill.!  8{
I will no doubt have flashbacks when I go to BBTA!!  Sounds like a 
cool trip, except for the Kitties.  Cats generally tend to freak out	
on car rides.  Maybe they'll get used to it after a while.  Just be	 
sure you take a litter box! ;)
