&gt;I suppose VW could have put in a wasserboxer in the bug..like it
&gt;did with the Vanagon, but the design of the bug, in terms of
&gt;the market place, is so out of date.

interestingly enough, the customizing firm of Oettinger (also known as
OKRASA ... the folks who built the 6-cylinder engine for the vanagon)
did exactly that: put the 4-cylinder wasserboxer (vanagon water-cooled)
engine into a beetle. the picture i saw made it look as if it had been
designed with the beetle in mind.  makes you wonder sometimes about what
vw thinks about (but never does). :)
