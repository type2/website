2 TV VW sightings:

1) on that Pesio commercial with the Pepsi truck driver and the Coke
driver, etc, you can see a snow covered bug when driver A throws driver B
out the window during the brawl.

2) on the news story about the brazilian (?) soldier shooting the suspect,
it was a deluxe bus they dragged him out of before they shot him.  No
doubt to take the bus.
