Subject: Re: Safari Wipers

Does anybody know if those do-dads that allow one to fold down safari 
window wipers are being reproduced? - Thanks!
------
they probably are-

there are two kinds-  55-64, then 64-67 (lets ignore the barndoors)

I bought an NOS wiper pivot for my 61 for the unspeakable sum of $85.
