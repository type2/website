&gt;&gt;     Other women on this list, I'd like to hear from you. Any similar road
&gt;&gt; side tangos??? What should you do? What can you do?? It's improper to mace a
&gt;&gt; guy who insists on helping you change a flat, isn't it??????? *damn*   ; )

Comming back from the bug-out I caravaned with a 63 single cab, 64 21
deluxe, and a 66 Kombi, (I was driving an ugly 71 westy). When one of the
members was tired he pulled of the road and we would follow, and we would
all get out and talk. Well on one such occasion we pulled off the interstate
and some fellow pulled over in a jetta or gulf or something and said: &quot;I saw
all these VW's and thought I would pull over to help, hey are these those
busses that all have the rotted out floors and crapped put engines.&quot; we all
looked at each other bewildered and didn't know what to say other than &quot;uh
yep.&quot; then one of the party noticed that the fellow had a large mag lite. We
each used it to illuminate the engine compartment to check our oil. After a
while the guy said &quot;since none of y'all are broke down I guess I'll be going.&quot;

Moral of the story: Some people are weird!!
