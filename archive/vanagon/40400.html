&gt;&gt;I met today by accident a guy who has an early 70's Transporter with an 6 
&gt;&gt;cylinder corvair engine for sale. The body of the bus is pretty rusty but 
&gt;
&gt;I installed a 110 hp corvair *and* transaxle in a '70 bus back in '76 so I
could tow a racecar.  It was a four-sp w/3.89 gears and a positraction;  it
was dead slug reliable, bulletproof, 2.8 litres, flat-six smooth (ask Bob
Hoover about flat sixes in aircraft as opposed to flat fours).
&gt;
&gt;I got a very consistent 21+ mpg.
&gt;
&gt;The engine mechanicals - heads, pistons, combustion chambers, rods, etc are
very similar to typical small-block Chevy stuff, and are therefore
conservatively engineered for long life.  Even though it's air-cooled, it
was done right as compared to VW's version of air cooling.
&gt;
&gt;I blue-printed the engine to dead stock - took apart every single piece
while rebuilding it (myself), balanced it, rebuilt the transaxle myself to
install the posi &amp; the 3.89's, changed the oil every 3k miles(religiously -
even on trips), &amp; put 100k on the whole installation while only tuning it up
every 10k.
&gt;
&gt;I could start at the bottom of Waldo Grade at 50 mph &amp; be doing 70 at the
top - fully loaded!
&gt;
&gt;But '70 was the last year for drum brake front ends - &amp; it definitely
didn't stop as well as it went!
&gt;
&gt;Today I'd suggest you check local smog laws b4 getting into it too far .
&gt;
&gt;Today I have an '87 w/2.1l vasserboxer - &amp; yet I still pine for the +power+
of the 'vair.
&gt;
&gt;Clark's Corvair parts is still very much in business, also KEP will have
lots of info for you (they made the kit I used that utilized the Chevy
transaxle)
&gt;
&gt;Oh, almost forgot - you'll have a real, functioning heater lever - almost
as good as water-cooled's!  (ever try driving over the Siskiyous wearing a
sleeping bag?! - beentheredonethatgotoldquick)
&gt;
&gt;Good luck - do it if you can.
&gt;

ps -- I'm taking the liberty of a general posting in case there are other
people interested - sorry if this isn't kosher, disclaimer being that I'm
new at this .  .
