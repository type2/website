Jiri has the deflectors and loves them.  He also pointed out that 
they allow him to keep windows open a bit while camping in the rain.
(He doesn't have louvres).

I placed an order with HP Products (they answer the phone as a 
Christian book store (!)).  They are out-of-stock at the moment
but will ship when possible.
