Richard,

You listed many problems but they seem to fall into two categories: leaks, 
and brakes dragging.  Perhaps the dragging is caused by air in the lines, 
and perhaps the air gets there through the same leaks that the fluid gets 
out.

I can't over emphasize how important your brakes are.  Many people's lives, 
including your own, depend on them.

Before you take that trip, I think that you need to:

1) Fix all the leaks.
2) Re-read Bob Hoover's sermon about brake line connections and be
   sure yours are acceptable.

Perhaps at this point everything will be OK.  If not, either postpone that 
trip, or take a different car.

We will all thank you,
Mike
