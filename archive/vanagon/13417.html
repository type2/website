Subject: Re: Cuttin' a big ole hole in my roof...

Alert. Alarm. 

Uh...I don't think you can cut that hole. There is special reinforcements
for that hole in a factory westy and god knows what you would have to do to
replicate them. I don't think they are documented very well either. 

I think you have to consider cutting just a little hole.  

The consensus I have gathered from experts is that you really cannot cut
that hole.

&gt;Greetings-
&gt;	
&gt;	Well, I've bitten off quite a huge project.  I bought a 1982 Westy, 
&gt;wrecked, that I planned on having a bodyshop repair for me.  It is, apparently,
&gt;buggered beyond repair.  At least that's what 3 bodyshops have told me.  So now
&gt;to Plan B:  Transfer all the neat Westy stuff to a non-Westy vanagon.  I can
&gt;handle all the mechanical and interior and wiring tasks, but I will have to
farm
&gt;out the hole-cutting chores.
&gt;
&gt;	My quesion:  How is the Westy reinforced to allow for (1) loss of
&gt;structural integrity due to the gaping absence of roof, and (2) the weight of
&gt;the upper bunk to be supported by the remaining bits of roof?
&gt;
&gt;	One bodyshop has already agreed to cut the hole for me; I just want
&gt;to make sure I don't do anything unsound here.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;--Dale
