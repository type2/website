Subject:      he's after the Unknowns again!!! ...

ok. there are entirely toooo many &quot;unknowns&quot; on the list. an Unknown is
someone who hasn't fessed up as to which year/model/whatever bus they are
driving/pushing/living in/etc.

a Wanabus is someone who does not have a bus right now, but wants one and
is somewhat intent on getting one within the next decade or so. :)

so ... in order to shame enough of you into confessing as to which bus you
have, or that you are a Wanabus, i'm posting the list of names of the Unknowns
... so you can email directly to me and let me know what sort of vehicle you
have.

what happens if you don't? well ... i sulk and pout and wait a week or so
before i do something like this again. what happens if you do? well ... you
get included into the Grand and Gloriously Magnificent Manifestation of the
Weakly Statistics, posted almost every Friday, give or take a whim.

for example:

50 Microbus   0  59 Microbus   6  68 Bus   5  80 Vanagon  10  91 Eurovan   1

and for those of you who don't feel the Omnipotent Threat of Little Brother,
if you want to include your city and province/state/country, that would also
be appreciated. the other half of the Weakly Stats is a breakout of country,
state by numbers. so far, the california bay area seems to be in the lead ...
but the rest of us are not really sure where they are headed. :)
