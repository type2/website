Betreff: 	Syncro front shocks questio

Vie Gehts.    

Gut geht's ! Danke !

Then one of the list members mentioned that he had heard there were 3 shocks 
listed for the front of Syncro Vanagon's in Germany.  I need someone to verify 
this for me as I do not speak German.

I would like to know Part Number,

front: 	251 413 031 C	regular
	251 413 031 M	14'' HD package &quot;Schlechtwegepaket&quot;
	251 413 031 N	16''


rear:	251 513 031 D	regular
	251 513 031 M	14'' HD package
	251 513 031 N	16''

Peter Seikel in Freigericht near Frankfurt/Main recommends the &quot;N&quot; absorbers.
He could give you a quote and also details about the technical data maybe 
manufacturerer.

Auto Seikel GmbH
Herr Peter Seikel
Industriestrasse 5
D 63579 Freigericht
Phone: +49 - 60 55 - 52 82
Fax: +49 - 60 55 - 82 731

Seikel used to develop racing and off-roading suspensions for all kinds of VW 
and Audi also the T3 syncros he is probably the most experienced person about 
these items. Give him a call or better a fax it is worth while. He also offers 
reinforced coil springs for the T3 syncro.

Another adress you could try is:

Phone: + 49 - 81 91 - 92 77 - 0

I am sure they all speak english. If there is no reaction or help from them 
give me a mail and I'll try for you again.

hope this was of any help for you 

till later Tom N.
