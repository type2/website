=========================\
Been there with an '83 BMW - although I didn't actually ask the dealer about a
replacement O2 sensor, I could pretty well guess.  So I went to the local
FLAPS Club called &quot;Auto Parts Club&quot;.  They carry a full line of fuel and
ignition parts from a company called FILKO that is supposed to have been in
the business for some 25+ years or so, and their O2 sensor was about $30 to
replace the Bosch unit, a direct replacement in both threads and connector,
and the threads were already pre-coated with anti sieze.  It lasted 4 or 5
years until I sold the car and was still going fine.
