&gt; 	She agreed that: she will pay for the parts at cost.  They will pay for
&gt; any repairs that the dealer says need to be made.  She will pay for none of
&gt; the labor incurred during the previous work (close to 20 hours _at_ $55).  To
&gt; sweeten the deal, they _gave_ her a new battery for the car!  Done deal!
&gt; 
&gt; 	Amy would like to extend a big thanks to all who helped during this
&gt; ordeal.  We would probably not fared as well without your help!
&gt; 

Thom,
	While I am sure this was quite a frustrating ordeal, I must admit
that I'm *mildly* impressed with any shop that cancels 20 hours of labour,
agrees to pay for the labour to fix it, and hands you a new battery. If
nothing else, that shows their hearts and business sense is toward the 
consumer; even if they make mistakes.
