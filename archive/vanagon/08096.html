&gt;would like to hear from you.  If it isn't possible I guess I'd like to hear 
&gt;about that too.

You *cannot* replace the *front* seal (front is FRONT) without removing the
engine, then removing the flywheel from the engine.  If you mean the REAR seal
(which early Type 1 engines don't have, per se), then you can probably replace
it easily with the engine in the car.
