Subject: Calibrating a micrometer

Hi folks,

I bought a used 1&quot; outside micrometer that came with some small tools and a
standard.  While the standard is not marked, it appears that it is .250&quot; but
the micrometer measures .004&quot; shy of that.  It does, however, zero out
perfectly when I measure the thickness of air (!!).

How do I use the calibration tools to make an adjustment?  Reference books
in my library do a great job of describing what a micrometer is, but not how
to adjust it.  Advice or a source for instructions would be appreciated.  If
I don't hear from you I'll just head over to a machine shop and pester the
machinist till he lets me in on the secret.

Thanks,

Ron
