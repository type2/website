Subject: Re: Syncro Parts Costs FYI

&gt;BOHICA number (Grand Total less tax)    4544.00

&gt;I can buy several 89's for that but then they're not syncro westies.

&gt;How's this compare to your experiences, Derek?


Excuse me, I think I have to get sick.

P.S. Actually, I haven't had to have these services performed except a new
clutch, which I burnt out four wheeling because I slipped the clutch too much
traversing bolder fields. 

One reason I may get sick is that I just sold one of my three front diffs to
a lady for only $750. Now knowing that the viscous coupling itself was worth
$1,700 makes me think I shouldn't have sold it. Oh well, what do I need three
front diffs for? One of mine is a factory locking front diff so I wanted to
get rid of one of my lowly non-locking front diffs.
