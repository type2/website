Subject: NY/NJ out to get your VW's off the road.


I just found this in the usenet  .aircooled group.  I don't live in NJ/NY
but I'd say unless this gets stopped, your VW's are history.  It looks like
the habits of the BATF have rubbed off on the exhaust sniffing crowd.  I
haven't confirmed any of this by the way.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;Millions of Drivers to be affected by New Vehicle Confiscation Law.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;On June 2, 1995, Governor Whitman signed legislation #SCS-1700.  It is 
&gt;&gt;NOW LAW, and will be fully implemented against all New Jersey car and 
&gt;&gt;truck owners as soon as the necessary testing facilities and remote 
&gt;&gt;monitoring stations are constructed, expected sometime in 1996-1997.  
&gt;&gt;Briefly SCS-1700 states the following.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;All motor vehicles over four years old will report to new Centralized 
&gt;&gt;Testing facilities for &quot;Enhanced Emissions Inspections.&quot;  If your car or 
&gt;&gt;truck fails this test, the vehicle MUST be taken off the road.  Only 
&gt;&gt;three percent of those vehicles failing the test and having spent a 
&gt;&gt;minimum of $450 for repairs will be granted a waiver allowing them to 
&gt;&gt;remain on the road for two more years.  You have no appeal and no other 
&gt;&gt;options.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Now for the Bad news.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Motor vehicles will cost $24.  The I/M Enhanced Emissions Test, in which 
&gt;&gt;an operator drives you car through a simulated dynometer test is designed 
&gt;&gt;to fail 60% of cars, this according to the EPA.  Almost no vehicles over 
&gt;&gt;10 years old are expected to pass.  You have no protection against damage 
&gt;&gt;or the destruction of your vehicle by such stress testing methods.  97% 
&gt;&gt;of those vehicles failing the new enhanced emissions test will have their 
&gt;&gt;registration renewal automatically denied by the state.  Such vehicles 
&gt;&gt;cannot be sold to any other individual or dealer and essentially become 
&gt;&gt;FORFEITED TO THE STATE., which will receive 'pollution credits' they can 
&gt;&gt;sell to industrial polluters for every vehicle they take off the road.  
&gt;&gt;Owners of failed vehicles must surrender their license plates within 45 
&gt;&gt;days...And since NJ law already prohibits you from having an unregistered 
&gt;&gt;vehicle on your own property, local law enforcement can then seize it at 
&gt;&gt;will.  Assisting in this effort, NJ DEP recently revised the state's 
&gt;&gt;definition of &quot;quasi-public&quot; to include ALL residential driveways and 
&gt;&gt;parking lots.  YES, you've lose your private property rights.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Repairs can only be attempted by a STATE CERTIFIED REPAIR FACILITY...to 
&gt;&gt;which you have no say about work quality or cost.  You can no longer 
&gt;&gt;legally perform emissions related repairs yourself, nor can you take it 
&gt;&gt;to your trusted mechanic (unless they first receive state certification 
&gt;&gt;and invest $100,000 in equipment).
&gt;
&gt;&gt;As part of SCS-1700, roadblocks will be established through the state to 
&gt;&gt;randomly test a percentage of all vehicles.  Automated sensing devices 
&gt;&gt;will be installed along New Jersey highways to monitor your vehicles 
&gt;&gt;emissions as you drive by.  Violators of the new emmisions new stands 
&gt;&gt;will have their license plate photographed!  Thus enabling the state to 
&gt;&gt;issue summons through the mail.  Severe penalties, fines, and jail time 
&gt;&gt;have been attached to all violates of this new legislation.  IN fact, 
&gt;&gt;the state will be kicking back a commission to local police for their help 
&gt;&gt;in seizing your car.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Remember, SCS-1700 is aimed at TAKING YOUR CAR OFF THE ROAD!  It is aimed 
&gt;&gt;at producing one car families.  Collector, hot rod, and hobbyist cars are 
&gt;&gt;history.  A spare car for local trips, a teenage driver, student, or the 
&gt;&gt;commuter park and ride is history.  The classic Mustang convertible has 
&gt;&gt;been redefined as a 'gross polluter' and is now targeted by the state for 
&gt;&gt;the crusher.  Many car and truck related businesses will suffer or fail.  
&gt;&gt;Ironically, state officials are now recommending you start saving your 
&gt;&gt;money now to buy a new car, an impossibility for most individuals given our 
&gt;&gt;total tax burden of around 50%.  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The issue here is ever increasing government controlling not only your 
&gt;&gt;mobility, your life, and your freedom, but even your ability to work, and 
&gt;&gt;earn a living.  It has almost nothing to do with clean air.  Remember 
&gt;&gt;that you have NO LEGAL RIGHT TO DRIVE in this state.  New Jersey 
&gt;&gt;considers it their PRIVILEGE to allow you to drive on their roads...and 
&gt;&gt;starting sometime in 1996, they will be taking it back.  As state by EPA 
&gt;&gt;region 8 administrator William Yellowtail, &quot;Cleaning up cars on the roads 
&gt;&gt;is only half the solution...the much more difficult part involves getting 
&gt;&gt;people out of their cars.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Sound far fetched?  Can't Happen?  Remind you of a Soviet or Nazi style 
&gt;&gt;police state?  FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF.  Call legislative services at 
&gt;&gt;1-800-792-8630 and ask for a free copy of SCS-1700.  Ask for your 
&gt;&gt;legislator's phone number and voice your concern.  Call DMV director Dick 
&gt;&gt;Kamin at 1-609-984-9827 and request all administrative and DEP 
&gt;&gt;regulations associated with SCS-1700.  Call Governor Whitman at 
&gt;&gt;1-609-292-6000. Ask for a repeal of this horrendous legislation.  Most 
&gt;&gt;importantly, SPREAD THE WORD!  Copy and distribute this flyer 
&gt;&gt;everywhere.  Fax it to business associates.  Warn your friends.  Till 
&gt;&gt;now, you've heard few details regarding SCS-1700.  Since politicians 
&gt;&gt;desperately want to keep the nightmare they've rammed through the 
&gt;&gt;legislature quiet until after you re-elect them.  Remember this election 
&gt;&gt;day, that you finally have an alternative to the Two party system that 
&gt;&gt;once again stomped all over your rights...and VOTE!
