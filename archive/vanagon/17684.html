The Northwest damp has got to my '67 bus.  The &quot;stuff&quot; that the sliding
windows slides on--some sort of fabric, I'd reckon--now resembles
buffalo snot, or maybe pond scum.  Kinda green and slippery.

Anyone had experience replacing this?  Is there some suggested
source of supply for such an esoteric item?
