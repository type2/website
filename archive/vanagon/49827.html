&gt;&gt;I'm the ecstatic new owner of a primo condition white '91 Westy Synchro with
&gt;&gt;47k miles.  It's my first synchro after having owned three Westies (two '72s
&gt;&gt;and one '84 Wolfsburg) and a '62 Bug. Will need to put new tires on it and
&gt;&gt;would appreciate suggestions for a good on and off-road tire that can get me
&gt;&gt;out of the Colo. rockies, down to southern Mexico (Oaxaca) and around steep
&gt;&gt;dirt roads, sometimes muddy.  Good gas mileage might be a consideration,
&gt;&gt;too. if that's a factor in tire selection.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;The consensus seems to be BFG Radial All Terrain T/A, size 27 850 14. The
&gt;best price I've seen is mail order for $78 ea incl tax + $48 shipping for a
&gt;set (call 1 800 589 6789). Be sure to get a 5th tire for spare, this is a
&gt;syncro requirement. This is primariily an off-road tire, but has good
&gt;highway characteristics according to many on the list with this tire. I'm
&gt;running Michelin LTX 195 75 14 on my syncro Westy, but I don't do a lot of
&gt;steep muddy roads.

I love those Michelins which were rated #2 by Consumer Reports last Jan(?).
But the #3 tire was the same Michelins with the All Terrain tread!  I
think they're called the LTX AT but I'm not positive.  BFG were rated
fairly low by CR so I'd stick with the Michelins.  I got mine at Tire Rack
for $79.
