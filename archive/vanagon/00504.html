&gt; and i calculated a figure of 16.75 mph per 1000 rpm for my bus, based on
&gt; all that garbage i did, running up and down the highway. i figure it's
&gt; tires, friction losses, wind resistance, etc. that makes the difference.

Here's something you may find funny about friction and resistance.  Several
years ago I was traveling north on I-95 in Virginia.  There are long
hills along the away and I came up with the idea to see how 'aerodynamic'
the Vanagon is.  After going over one hill doing 70 mph and I let it
coast in neutral.  By the time I got to the bottom I was doing about 55 mph.
I guess if your brakes give out you can just let it coast until you stop.
