Subject: Re: RE: speedometer error

Thanks for thr erudite debunking of my estimate of spped. I have to find a
straight stretch of road with mile markers to check out the speedometer.
Until then I will be in blissful ignorance of my true speed and think that
when I show 65 with everyone zooming past me, that I really am doing 65.
