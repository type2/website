Subject: need ventilation in rear of vanagon

Speaking of rear vent windows for ventilation, does anyone have a suggestion
as to how I can get more air in my '81 westy while sleeping?  The mid
windows of course have the sliders with screens, and this helps, but
I'd love it if the 2 rear windows had this as well.  Is it possible
to find some of the midwindows at the junkyard and put them in place
of the rear windows?  Other suggestions?
