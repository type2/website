Subject:  81 update, back in michigan

i think the last time i wrote i was in vermont with low compression
(90-115) on a freshly rebuilt engine (2,000 miles).  i was also getting a
chirping sound on acceleration, and had difficulty starting (had to crank
the engine over for longer than normal).  i was worried about getting
home to michigan.  

i consulted the mechanic who did the rebuilid, and he said just to drive it
home and he would take care of it, no charge,  _if_ it was hiis fault. 
well, these symptoms are _exactly_ the same ones mobius had before
the operation, only on the other side of the engine.  and what mobius
was sick with before was dropped valve seats.  having procured the
rebuilt heads myself from mark stephens high performance, the
mechanic's offer would not cover this condition.

i also consulted the list wisdom, and the feedback i got
was that the case might be worn causing an improper head/cylinder
interface, causing the shim in between to vibrate like a reed.  the
mechanic seriously doubted that this was the case.

i was stuck, holiday weekend, vacation time used up, had to be to work 
on monday, nobody in town would check it out, so i decided i really had
no choice but to head for home.  i took it easy and made it alright, after
consuming three quarts of oil in less than 1000 miles.

the van has now returned to the shop, where it will be torn down by the
end of the week.  i'm interested to see what the problem is, as i suppose
many folks on the list might be as potential customers for rebuilt heads.

ps - many thanks to those who offered assistance, advice, and even
just a friendly reply when i was in vermont.
