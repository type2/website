Hello vanagon gang,
I'm back for a while after taking a sabatical in order to try to find
a job.  (Did I? Ha Ha) 

In this period of break from the list, my vanagon engine blew up sending
parts all over the rear of my engine compartment.  Anyway, I've now put
another engine in which also spews oil all over my rear.  I hope to fix
this particular problem tonight ... it seems that two rear oil seals have
leaks in them.
However, a most disturbing problem has developed.  My speedometer works
just fine but the odometer does not.  In principle, I guess I could leave
things like this but I'd really like to get the odometer fixed.  Has anyone
had this happen after replacing an engine?  What could I have done wrong?

There is also a second problem with my engine ... the temperature seems to
be just a bit higher than the other engine.  Could it be that this engine
has been fitted with a high temperature thermostat or should I be very
concerned about this?
