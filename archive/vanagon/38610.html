I used to love air cooled also.  Couple years after owning an 84 I suddendly
remembered doing valve jobs as routine prep for any long trip was no longer
neccasary.  Being able to tow cars without blowing anything up was nice too.
 Driving all day at 75mph is neat too. I'm now spoiled, I like my water to
keep me cool.  After driving about 300K in variuos waterboxer vans without
doing any head work, I'll fix the leaks when they come.  Good maintenance is
the key.  I,ve repairewd many leaky heads for others.
Dennis.
