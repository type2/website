Subject: places to put gauges
Date: Wed, 21 Sep 1994 22:53:14 -0500 (CDT)

Long time ago, there was a thread on what the best place would be to put
additional gauges in your bus.

Well, I'm installing a tachometer (3-1/8&quot;) in the empty slot right
alongside the speedometer. RMMW sells an adapter ring (#938-842) for that
purpose. The sales rep told me he has the same in his bus and that it
looks great, as-if-it-were-part-of-the-original-equipment. 

I'm also getting a cylinder head temp gauge in addition to the oil temp
and oil pressure gauges I already had under the dash. I found a perfect
spot for those three 2-1/16&quot; gauges: right between the radio and the
ashtray. Carefully cut out holes in the dash and now they fit very nicely.
The holes are tight enough so I don't need to use the back bracket (which
wouldn't fit anyway because the dash is so thick at that place.
