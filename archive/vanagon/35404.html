Transporter Renewed.
--------------------

Volkswagen has improved the Transporter. There is a economic
direct injected turbo diesel added to the engine program
and the suspension is improved. The exterior and interior
also got a few new things. The transporter is available in two
wheelbases, 2920 and 3320mm, and three loading categories,
800, 100 or 1200 Kg. The Transporter is available in many forms,
closed van, closed van with high roof, van with windows, van
with windows and high roof, pick-up single cab, pick-up doule
cab, chassis single cab and chassis double cab. there is a
choice between five engines: 1.9 diesel (50 kW), 2.4 five
cylinder diesel (57 kW), 2.5 five cylinder TDI (75 kW), 2.0
gasoline (62 Kw) and a 2.5 five cylinder gasoline (81 kW). All
Transporters come standard with the five speed transmission. An
automatic transmission is available in combination with the 2.5
five cylinder gasoline engine. The short wheelbase Transporter
fits on every normal parking space and in every parking garage,
but nevertheless, the passenger and cargo compartments are bigger
than other cars of the same size. The cargofloor is flat and low
because of the frontmounted engine. Small rearwheeltubs provide
a wide cargofloor. The closed van has a slidingdoor on the right
side and a big hatch in the rear for easy loading/unloading.
Two rear wingdoors are optional. They can open to 180 degrees.
It is possible to order the Transporter with an aditional sliding-
door on left side or without slidingdoors at all. The 2.5 direct
injected turbodiesel (TDI) is new for the Transporter. The TDI
has allready earned its economic reputation. The five cylinder
turns out 75 kW and averages 8 L/100 Km. Thanks to the high torque
it's very strong over a wide RPM range, even under the toughest
circumstances. With the new PLUS front axle handling is improved
by using a shorter steering-reaction radius and changed geometry.
The good handling, the stability and the lack of side wind
sensitivity are the gain of these improvements.
The Synchro option is available on all Transporter models for
better traction under all circumstances. The power assisted brake
system now also incorporates disc brakes on the rear axle.
A brake pressure regulator keeps the rear wheels from locking up,
it senses brake pressure and rearaxle load. Anti locking brakes
(ABS) are available in combination with an electronic locking
differential (EDS). The active and passive safety of the Transporter
are the same as of a modern passenger car. Dual airbags are
available as an option. The Transporter got bigger bumpers, they
are somewhat larger and have a new foam inside. Because of this they
resist small crashes upto 4 km/h without damage. The front fenders
are now bolted to the car for easy replacement in case of body damage.
The drivers position is improved and all switches are revised.
A reminding buzzer for lights and other electricals users is standard.
The new upholstry is even finer than before.

The picture shows that the new Transporter has new headlights and
grille, more Passat-like.
