hello!

i'd like that info too.  someone did this to steal a bike out of my
bus.  the peg on the bottom was obviously rusty and it broke rather
easily.

thanks,
	brandy


&gt;
&gt;    How do you replace the vent window in the sliding door on a 75 bus?
&gt;    Looks like it had a peg at the bottom and top and it pivoted there.
&gt;    Mine no longer has a peg on the bottom.
