Subject: RE: /f thank you for my neuroses


 &gt; Last night i Dreamed that i and my family were driving to Albe State
 &gt; Park (none exists of course but the name was very clear) in our Titan
 &gt; Red '87 Westy (yup, i Dream in color) when suddenly we came upon a
 &gt; tanker truck parked cross-wise in the road ahead of us.  I saw it too
 &gt; late to stop and drove right under it.  Just as we went under the
 &gt; belly of the truck i was thinking &quot;We're gonna make it!  We'll go
 &gt; right under.&quot; when we felt the splintering crash of fiberglass
 &gt; impacting steel.  I looked in the rear-view mirror and saw a snowshower
 &gt; of fiberglass fibers, twinkling like ice crystals in the air.
 &gt;
 &gt; None of this would've happened without you... the thoughts of van
 &gt; height, horror stories of low underpasses, continual threads on body
 &gt; repair and painting.  thank you.  i really must find a new group to
 &gt; hang around with.
