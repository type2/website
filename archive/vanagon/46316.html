Subject: '84 stalling problems

My '84 westy has developed an annoying stalling problem when it is cold.
It does not seem to be related to ambient temperature.  After the van is
warmed up it does not stall.  I recently replaced the oxygen sensor but it
did not help.  Does anyone have any suggestions what I should check next?

Thanks,

John Brown
