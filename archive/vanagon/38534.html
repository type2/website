Subject: emergency parts needed!!(74 westy)

Help,

I flunked my emissions, as I posted earlier, and need to get the parts to
get everything running.

Here is the problem.  On 72-74 Bus motors, the smog pump is driven off of
a clutch-mounted pulley coming off the crankshaft.  This part is necessary
to make the smog pump run, and to get an emissions waiver.  I can't
register my car until I get this part.  The bad news is that the part is
not available anywhere.  Nobody can order it new, it's not made.  No
junkyards have any of these anywhere.  I can't find it, and I've been
trying for 2 days.  Basically if you look at the engine, this part is the
part that the smog pump belt connects to.

A second problem is that nobody will rebuild my carb.  It is a dual-carb
setup, and I have no clue as to how to rebuild it myself.  Even VW repair
shops refuse to touch it.

If you have a wrecked 72-74 Bus, PLEASE let me know.  I need this part
desperately.  Or, if you know where to find one, let me know.  Has anyone
had their carb rebuiilt?  Who did it?  Has any other 74 Bus owner been in
my situation and if so, how did you fix the problem?

Thanks,
Craig
