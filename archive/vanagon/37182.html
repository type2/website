&gt; &gt; Her are some pictures of the class three hitch as installed on Joe's
&gt; &gt; van,(East Coast Joe).  Note he also had a complete exhaust put on his Syncro
&gt; &gt; the same day.  BTW, he is looking for a set of alloy wheels for this van.

I'm there!  Don't get me wrong, I'd like to see the hitch.  Hell, I'd like
to contemplate the rustout on somebody's dogleg some night after a couple
of beers, but maybe a web page post would be the theater for that, or
privately mailing to those interested.  That download tied up my phone for
at least 8 minutes, and I still had another 95 messages to go.  Couldn't
read the images anyway, as it turned out...
