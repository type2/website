Subject: Brazilian Bus: The Plan

i think this will work.  first i go to the junkyard and buy a junkie vw bus,
any year, and i use it for parts.  I register the junker and then take the VIN
plate off of it and take it to brazil, where i buy a new bus and attach the
VIN from the other bus.  i drive the bus from brazil to columbia, take a ferry
to panama (i am told that only a land rover can cross the border swamps) and
drive through mexico to the us. At the border they check my registration,
search my car because i look like a hippy, i just came from south america, and
i am driving a vw bus.  they find no drugs and let me on my way.

possible problems;
    i may have to buy a bus not from the junkyard because a reconstructed
    title on a brand new brazilian bus may look suspicious.
    i may get killed if i drive through south america with an american plate/
    registration.
    the mexican border may have some silly requirement that only cars driven
    out of the us may drive back in, especially if they are us registered. if
    they have some sort of carpassport thing and say &quot;if this is a us car how
    did it get to brazil&quot; and i say &quot;umm, hey these things can really fly&quot;


raise your hand if you think this plan will work
