Subject: High Brake Pedal Effort ('71 Camper)

Hi,

I'm new to the list so I don't know if this has been discussed 
before.  I have a '71 camper with power assist brakes.  I have good 
solid pedal feel with no fade, but it takes a lot of force to haul 
this baby down!  I though the front or rear circuit was leaking but 
front and back wheels bind when I raise the car and have someone push 
on the brake pedal.  I suspect it might be the assist diagphragm (or 
whatever you call it) on the master cylinder.  Does anyone know how 
to diagnose a failure of this unit, or have any other suggestions.

Chris
