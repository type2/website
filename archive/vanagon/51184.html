Subject: Re: Oil filler

Joel,

What's with the idea of putting the oil filler tube cap on the rear deck.
You should ALWAYS put it between the flap and the van body. First, it holds
the flap open just right and, second, you will not forget to put it back
on.(At least this works on my '91GL's.)

I have also found that a loop of rubber around the oil bottle and attached
to the rear hatch latch holds the bottle so almost all the oil flows out
while I mess around on other jobs. I haven't spilled any oil on the
flap...just pure talent.

Has anyone seen Castrol 20-50 in the 5 gallon jug for $5? Wal-Mart here has
only 10-30.

Herb
