&gt;&gt;&gt;Volswagen has a new video available to commemorate their 40th
&gt;&gt;it is available by calling 1-800-444-vwus. 
&gt;
&gt;Is it free?

&gt;Yes it is free. They have plenty of other stuff... just ask. I have previously
gotten a Eurovan introduction  and another video on the history of VW hosted by 
Tom Skerritt.
