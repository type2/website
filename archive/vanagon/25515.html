Interesting ad in this weeks Want-Ad (local classifieds magazine):

&quot;VW 84 Westphalia, Van/Camper, fully equipped, cherry inside, reblt
engine needs finishing, $3000.00/OBO, (Gaithersburg,MD) (301) 216-1248&quot;

Standard disclaimers apply. Also, my personal note: When somebody uses the term
&quot;cherry&quot; in an ad, I immediately become suspicious of that person. Maybe it's
just me. That word coveys as much fear in me as the &quot;I rebuilt it myself&quot; phrase
used by a seller. Also, the fact that this joker could not finish the rebuild
makes me wonder. But, if you could talk him down real cheap......

Just my $.02 worth.
