So Joel Walker says:
&gt; 
&gt; however, for those of you who do use it, also put it on your outside
&gt; rearview mirrors and rear window and drivers window: it keeps the morning
&gt; dew-fog from forming, so you don't have to wipe them off to start driving.
&gt; don't know if it will work on snow. ;)

Of course, (sounding as snooty as possible) if you have the heated outside 
rearviews, you may skip the above step entirely.  ;P

&gt; windshield polish: we polished my nephew's windshield with some extremely
&gt; fine paint/body polish (rubbing compound) and it made a tremendous difference
&gt; .. it got all kinds of stuff off the glass, made it really really really
&gt; clean. it also made the water bead up, like rain-x. eventually, it wears off
&gt; though ... and i thought surely it would smear from the wipers, but it didn't.

My main problem is with the wiper.  Even with new ones.  What happens is I
get them installed and after a relatively short time, the blade tends to
stay bent in one direction so that if there is not enough water on the
windshield, they chatter across their path driving both driver and passenger
insane!
