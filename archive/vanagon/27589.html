&gt; .013.  It's very obvious that my crankshaft would be slamming back and

Hey!!! YOU have my problem! Check the archives about end-play. It seems 
that the geometry of the components is such that if the crankshaft 
bearing that the shims rest upon is sloppy because it has been hammered 
(or the case underneath it is hammered) then what you are seeing will 
happen. I was ready to put my head in a vice.  I thought I was being so 
dumb.  It took a lot of thinking to figure out what was going on.  If I 
had the thing apart I would have figured it out quicker, but I couldn't 
figure out what was worn. (I couldn't figure out what kept the flywheel 
IN. (The shims keep it OUT). So I asked people on the list who had had 
the thing apart. On mine it is causing the seal to leak and I'm getting a 
bad clutch every 5,000 miles or so. eventually I'll have to fix it....
Probably with a new case at this rate.
