&gt;Aww, don't give up yet, Rusty!  Don't believe the parking garage wimps
&gt;until you try it out.  I've gotten our 6' 8&quot; westy into parking
&gt;garages marked as having as little as 6' 5&quot; clearance.  (And yes, I got
&gt;the camper out again!)  The trick is taking it slow and watching the
&gt;clearance between the top of the camper and the ceiling of the garage as
&gt;I drive.
&gt;
&gt;'Course, it helps if you're tall like me, so you can drive while sticking
&gt;your upper body out the side window far enough to see the roof of the
&gt;camper to make sure you don't scrape things up!  Shorter folks should
&gt;have friends with them when trying out new garages, I guess...

With all due respect to Tobin, DON'T DO IT!!! I drove a Chevy 14-pass. van
through a parking garage in which it had fit before. Unbeknownst to me, the
tires had been changed so that the van was about 1/4&quot; too tall for the
parking structure. After scraping under the clearance sign and several
parts of the roof, I find it hard to recommend the risk. The biggest
problem (other than the horrifying scraping on roof) is that with many
parking ramps, by the time you realize it's too big it's almost impossible
to back out or turn around. In my case, the entrance was at the bottom of a
ramp, just wide enough for one car, and several cars were already occupying
the space behind me.

And no, it didn't work (we tried) for everyone &quot;to think REAL small.&quot; ;-)
