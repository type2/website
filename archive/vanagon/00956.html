Subject: Re: SUBSCRIBE VANAGON JOSEPH T

joel...I guess my reply to the original post and your stat msg crossed in
the mail especially since my 1st attempt went to .ualvm instead of .ua1vm.
Anywho, you got my stats now and mine is an 88 GL in Dove Blue also.  I'd be
happy to see what mods you've made to yours just out of curiosity. I haven't
done hardly anthing to mine since I had the 76 Camper that I did all sorts
of little stuff to.
 
My wife thinks I'm a nut for just wanting a VW van of some sort or another
since she's known me.  If she knew that what I really want is a Mercedes
Westphalia van (vs the VW Winnie), she have me committed.  I've actually
dreamed of a Mercedes van ever since I saw one in Germany back in the early
70's.  Reality has forced me to settle for VW's and my new one won't
probably be a 95 VW Winnie unless I win the Lotto.  But here I go off in la
la land again.
 
My immediate prospects are a 91 Vanagon or a 93 Eurovan MV, which I'm not
too thrilled with either compared to the handling on the Vanagon or Type II.
In fact I prefered the Type II since it was much lighter on foot.  Too bad
it didn't have the Vanagon's power.  The Eurovan's are almost just like the
American minivans, tho a tad better IMHO.  As a teenager, I had a fleeting
infatuation with a microbus that I'd never admit in public.  I settled for a
56 Chevy, mods: 327, 4sp, etc.  BTW, the wife wants a Caravan or Voyager.
 
I'd prefer to post public rather private.  It brings the lunies out and
that's when the real truth usually comes out from left field somewhere when
you least expect it.  It keeps the mailing list worth subscribing to.
 
Thanx for the offer on the microfiche but I no longer have access to such an
obsolete piece of machinery.  They got rid of it at work since everything is
in the computers now.  However, shud you have that info in any kind of file,
I would be most appreciative of it.  Pls send it to
jtabaco_at_smtpgate.ssmc.noaa_dot_gov since that gateway for me has MIME for most
file formats.
 
The farm is great as long as I don't have to wear the straight jacket here
like I have to do at work.  Keep up the great service...Joey
