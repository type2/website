Subject: Re: Tires &amp; Pressure '85 Westy


&gt; My '85 Westy has tires put on by PO.  They are BF Goodrich P185/75R 14 
&gt; 89S M&amp;S.  I notice the max tire pressure on the tires say 35 psi.  I
&gt; have noticed in the camper owners manual it has one pressure, in the     
&gt; Bentley another and some people on the list recommend still another.     
&gt; Can anyone recommend what I should be using.

The recommended tire pressure varies greatly from one year to the next, for 
reasons which I can't explain.  Recommended pressure for an '85 Westy is 39 
psi front, 48 rear, and I have found that to be more than satisfactory on 
my '85. But since your tires can't handle more than 35, that's probably 
what you should run with.
