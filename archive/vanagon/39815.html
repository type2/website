Subject: FS: Westy tent, freestanding



After I sold my Westy diesel (I had it in the paper for only a day), I 
will also sell my tent.

This tent is freestanding (attaches to the van) and it has never been 
used (except set up twice in my backyard).

My brother brought it from Germany last summer, when I still imagined we 
might be going camping with our twin girls (born June of last year). It 
has never been used for the simple reason that we're so busy now that 
camping is simply out of the question and if we get a break, it's just 
too much work.

The color is grey (to match the canvas of the late eighties westies) with 
yellow stripes and big windows that can be zipped open or closed. It does not 
have a floor.

I'd like to get around $400 since it's in perfect/new condition (around 
$750 or $800 new, but a new one you have to pick up in Germany yourself). 
Make an offer.

Please e-mail me at

Joerg
