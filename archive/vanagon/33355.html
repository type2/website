This is how mine had been run by the DPO.  The rubbing on the line
bothers me a lot (particularly after all these gasoline-related fire
stories).

What I've had in mind for a while now, if I can ever find the parts,
is a pair of inline fuel cutoffs.  Put one on each side of the engine
tin, and you're done.  When you want to pull the engine, close both
valves, pull one end out, and all you'll get is whatever sits in a
couple of inches of line.  Of course, it's a perfect setup for more
idiot stories....

Picture:

               ___              ___
                |   &lt;-valves-&gt;   |
               _|_              _|_
     _________|   |____________|   |________
     _______________|________|______________   &lt;- fuel line

                        |
                        |
    metal tubing that goes through engine tin


Comments?  Suggestions on parts sources?  All the ones I've found
either expect to be given a vacuum to operate, or really want to be
mounted onto a tank.  I want free-standing units.
