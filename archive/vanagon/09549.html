Subject: Heater fan replacment description requested.

I need to replace or repair the heater fan (front) in my '84 Vanagon.
If anyone on the list has done this and would care to describe with some 
detail that procedure, I'd appreciate it.

Bentley's describes removing the dash, but they talk about &quot;drilling out&quot; 
the steering shear bolts.  Is this usually done?  Does everyone just go 
out and buy the new parts?  What does it mean to &quot;drill them out&quot;?   Why 
are they drilled out? Won't they come out by unscrewing them?

Inquiring minds want to know... *I* want to know.

Thanks for any help!
