&gt; &gt;As a novice, I recommending just getting the cheapest sockett set and
&gt; &gt;wrenches, screw drivers etc. you can get.  I say this because ya never

&gt; I don't know, Steven. For me, having to work with crummy tools just took a
&gt; big bite out of the fun. They bend, break, and slip: major frustration.
&gt; Now I use mostly Craftmen's. Lifetime warranty implies that they preserve
&gt; their value, i.e. you can hope to resell them without making a major loss.
&gt; Yet, at a less tangible level, sinking $250 into tools enforces your
&gt; commitment to finish your project. 

I have to agree with Sami.  There is nothing that will screw up a job
like cheap tools.  Those $4 socket sets are not worth the cardboard box
that they are packaged in.  My approach is to buy one or two high quality
tools that I specifically need for the job I am doing, and beg/borrow/steal
the rest.  This way I can build up a collection of good tools without
selling my mother into slavery.  Whatever you do, don't buy those cheapo 
swap-meet-special tools, cause they _will_ break and you _will_ have to 
stop what you are doing, get cleaned up, drive to Sears and buy a good-
quality replacement anyway!  Mac and Snap On are the best, but they are
really, really, REALLY expensive and you can't find them in stores. 
Craftsman tools are almost as good and available at a Sears near you for
a lot less.  Crew-Line (Checker Shucks/Kragen) have a lifetime warranty
but they still break!  Okay in a pinch, though...
