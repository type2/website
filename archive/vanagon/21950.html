Subject: re: camping on Bureau of Land Managment Property

Martha,

I once camped in the Mojave Desert(see Tobin Copley's post) but it
wasn't BLM land, though it was Gov't land, Fort Irwin.  I was there
for the NTC(National Training Center, near Barstow if I am not mistaken)
it was for the military to go and pretend they were fighting the Russians
Not so appropriate now, but then it was. Not that you could go on to the
land occupied by Ft Irwin, but there were plenty of &quot;roads&quot; where the
sand was packed hard from all of the tanks(20 tons +) driving back and
forth.  While I was there I thought that this area would make great
camping.  There was one spot in particular, where we literaly drove
our jeep up a mountain until it was too steep to climb.  This put us
about 200 feet over the desert floor. Since the goal of the army is to
camouflage, there was hardly anything other than the desert to see. It wa
was amazing.  There are thousands upon thousands of unused acreage in
the Ft Irwin boundaries.  If any base should close, it should be this
one, and the land acquired by the BLM and opened up to campers(VW).
Sorry for the lack of VW content, but Tobin's post reminded me of this
portion of my life, and I had no one here to share it with.
