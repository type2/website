Subject: Re: Aircooled Search &amp; Rescue Team

Hey everybody, I just want to remind you Northeastern and Mid Atlantic
listmembers that a certain used parts vendor (if you go to the shows you'll know
who I mean) did the same kind of thing, ( helping himself by means of tow bar to
a certain type of aircooled German vehicle that wasn't a VW, which wasn't his,
and was on private property) and is now residing in jail.

Of course there are those that think he ought to stay there awhile, but I won't
get into that.

Anyway, use common sense, hey, if they want the car to sit in their yard and
rot, then it's their loss, not yours. (be patient, it'll make a great parts car
in 10 years when the old man dies!)
