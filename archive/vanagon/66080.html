 Hi,

There are a pair of U shaped gadgets included with the Winnebago stuff which
are used to pop out the Sony radio.  I replaced the Sony soon after getting
my 95 Eurobago.  I was looking for a CD player and a really good radio. I
also wanted a remote control to use from back in the camper.  I ended up
with a Pioneer DEH-PH815 with a Supertuner V radio.  The single play CD
player is behind the face plate.  I've been really happy with it.  The only
problem is that its display is hard to see in bright light.  I don't think
that model is current but there seem to be similar units available.

Disconnect the battery during installation so you don't fry the ignition
switch accessory contacts like I did!

Here's the Pioneer radio page:
