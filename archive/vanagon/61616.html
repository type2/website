Subject: VW Electrical contact enhancer


Hi all,

This came up on the VW usenet group and I thought that I would pass the
info along for anyone(everyone?) else who may have problems with the
electrical connections on their FI.  The stuff is called Stabilant 22A and
has a VW part # of ZVW-186-001.  There was a TSB that calls for it's use
in solving a variety of Digifart problems.  It is really expensive, and
I've not tried it out myself.  VW wants $40 for 2oz.  Below I've attached
the manufacturer's phone number, address, and prices.  If anyone has used
this stuff I would like to hear about your experiences.  Supposedly it 
works wonders.  TIA.
