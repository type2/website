What makes that even worse is when you have fuel injection.  My dad's 75 went 
up in smoke when the fuel line broke and the injector kept pumping that gas 
over the nice hot heat exchangers.  The only thing that kept the bus from 
exploding was the full tank of gas.  So I guess the moral of this story is my 
dad should of checked his fuel line more often.
