&gt;        BTW: 1)what have you people busted/bent on the underside of your 
&gt;Syncro while off-roading, if anything?
&gt;             2) what is the standard size Syncro (steel) rim 5.5 OR 6.0 x 
&gt;14, I'm a bit peeved I have 5.5 wide rims, and the dealer wants 
&gt;$191.00Cdn/rim for 6.0 size!
&gt;
&gt;thanks all,       tim s.
&gt;

In order to encourage Syncro owners on the list to do what I do and smash
the underside of your vehicles on rocks as often and as hard as possible it
is important to make the following points: 

1. The factory skid protection rails need to have added them 4 reinforcement
pieces running up to the body of the vehicle to keep these skid plates from
bending upwards during severe pounding. There are mounting holes in the
frame that can be used for this on either side of the body above the rear
piece. One also puts 1 reinforcement per rail on the middle two rails. 

2. For maximum protection, after reinforcing these rails, 3/8th thick
aluminum alloy steel skid plates can be cut and afixed to the rails.
(T6-6061 aluminum) This aluminum material is very strong and very light
weight, enabling you to bolt as much of it as you want under your vehicle,
even to the point that the entire underside is covered.
