Subject: Re: Pre67 Sunroof Question

When did a bus have a sunroof (except a deluxe).  In the latest issue of =
HotVWs on page 74, there is a 64 Standard(Kombi?) w/ a sunroof w/ no =
smaller windows like a Deluxe.  Is this factory?  What models had this =
as an option.  I thought that the sunroof was an option only on the =
Deluxe version.
-----

as to when-  The deluxe sunroof bus was first produced in 51, through 67

yes- it was possible to get kombis and microbuses with sunroofs (and belly
pans natch) as an option.  they were not imported into the states, as far as
i know, so are rare here.  the ones ive seen generally were brought over by
individuals, and usually had loccking steering columns.

Sliding roof buses were available as early as 1 june 51, when they introduced
underfloor plates.

does this help?
