Subject:      ok  here we go...

I have been lazy this summer and didn't fix 2 things on &quot;STRIDER&quot;. My heater
blower knob is frozen (all the way clockwise). If I turn it on it will heat
(from levers) but I can't turn the knob off or on (it comes off). Also, I had
an extra wiper for the front and with much stupidity, put it on the back
wiper. It stuck a few times (straight up) and I just pulled it clockwise an
inch or so so that it could return. It returned....permanently. My back wiper
doesn't work now. My Qs, anyone ever have these problems? How hard is it for
us mechanically challenged folks. To answer a criticism before it starts, I
have BENTLEY but it's pretty sketchy re: the heater controls and Im not yet
sure about the back wiper.

Also, I got my ports (2 water, 1 electric) and stove flue cover and skylight
seal from EuroAmerican RV Products (Delta-Six) and while I REALLY hate that
damned little plastic key for the tank water door, the lock on the outside
makes sense. I also like the fact that the door forms part of a funnel. I did
put on the new electrical port. My other one was missing a door (it does work
though).
  The rest I'll probably not put on yet (mainly because of that stupid little
plastic key. Anyone seen any of the plate-like vanagon hubcaps at a salvage
yard? Also, we bought a small ceramic AC heater for campground camping (from
Camping World's catalog). We tested it when it was in the low 40s this last
week. It works great! Some of you may want to consider it. If only I could use
something like that AWAY from electrical hookups!
