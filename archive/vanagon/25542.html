Paul,
There are mobile techs that will go with you to check out the vehicle.  
If you can find one in the area that you're going to you wouldn't pay a 
premium for long travel times (for them).  They would probably be in the 
phone book under &quot;Auto Repair&quot;.  I'd check and see if they had any 
experience with older VWs before I'd commit.  Or just locate some of 
these guys and have them check the van before you even go and look.  That 
way there's no emotional quotient to get around if they nix the potential 
purchase.  Even if you have to spend $250 to check out 4 or 5 vehicles, 
it's cheap insurance against having to replace the heads or an engine 
soon after you get it.  I've read enough horror stories here on the list 
of people having the van go South on the way home from purchase that, if 
I needed the service, I would definitely use it.  
Just my $00.02.
Jack

&gt; or even three to find the &quot;right&quot; one.  I can't wait that long!!  Is there a 
&gt; directory of places I could use to have the buses checked out?  Even that's 
&gt; not cheap at $50 a pop.   Help!?!?!?
