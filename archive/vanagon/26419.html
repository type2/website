Subject: Anyone else have this problem (CO too high)?

Hi All,
I'm still trying to unravel what's causing the CO on my 81 (AFC, 
basically L-Jetronic) to come out too high.  I have a new AFC on it, have 
checked all grounds, voltages, etc.  I'm going to pull the injectors 
today and see if one of them is locked open or has a bad spray pattern.  
BTW, hydrocarbons are in spec, if that makes any sense.  I don't have a 
CO/oxygen sensor to use to figure out the problem.  I've leaned the 
adjusting screw all the way out and can only get the CO to 1.75 
(spec=1.5) at idle, higher at higher rpms.  Compression is ~100 on all 
cylinders.

Any suggestions, thoughts, ideas from the Bosch book (which I also don't 
have but should get), etc., would be greatly appreciated as I'm about at 
the end of my thoughts on how to proceed.

One question.  Bentley suggests looking for intake manifold leaks, 
injectors, etc.  Could leaky intakes cause a high CO and if so, how?

Thanks in advance,
Jack
