Subject: Re: 71 Westy - Alameda, CA -  $1,000

&gt;I've been eyeing a '71 Westy in Alameda, Calif for more than a month now, but
&gt;have decided to take a pass and let someone else have a shot at it.  It is
&gt;your basic poptop, appears to have all canvas (incl tent), and NEEDS A MOTOR.
&gt; The body is fine, no rust, and the red paint would probably rub out pretty
&gt;well.  Asking price $1,000; I think they would take half or two-thirds of
&gt;that just to be rid of it.
&gt;
&gt;Story (by owner's father) is that &quot;it started smoking&quot; on the freeway, so
&gt;owner pulled over, and had it towed to Dad's home nearby (where I have seen
&gt;it sit for several weeks).  I crawled all over it, but not under it.  Popped
&gt;the top, checked the canvas, screens, and zippers -- real good.  Looks good
&gt;inside, jalousies good -- not new, but good.  Odom says 60-something (160?
&gt; 260?).  Dad started it briefly, but it sounded so bad that I said to kill it
&gt;(so it would still have core value).  Didn't check steering, tranny,
&gt;front-end, or nothin' like that.  A real crap shoot.
&gt;
&gt;It's parked in front of 1417-5th Street, Alameda CA. 
&gt; (From I-880, go thru Posey Tube.  
&gt;Continue on Wester Street till it T's with Central Ave.  
&gt;Right on Central for a few blocks.
&gt;Right on 5th Street for 1/2 block.  
&gt;Red Westy is at the curb on the left with &quot;for sale&quot; sign on windshield.  You
&gt;can't miss it.)  
&gt;Sign says call (510)769-1089, which isn't an Alameda number, so probably
&gt;daughter's phone.
&gt;
&gt;I almost bought it for an immediate rebuilt engine swap, but I've got no
&gt;place to do the work.  Plus, for the money, I think I'm going to get a
&gt;Detroit van of same vintage and camperize it as the summer passes.  (Flame
&gt;on, but remember what a sweet guy I was to tell you about this.)
&gt;
&gt;Rotsa ruck.  
&gt;
&gt;Usual disclaimers.
&gt;
&gt;--Jeff

I've got an engine for it if there are still any wanna '71 westies around
the Bay Area.

Eug,
'71

with two spare longblocks

Say Dave, am I supposed to take the whole longblock as a spare part when I trip?
