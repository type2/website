 Would you pass this on to me at dkautz_at_hpsidms1.sid.hp_dot_com please. I'd like
 to read both from automotive curiosity and to be better informed about the
 vacuum pump oil problem we are having here at work. 

 Many Thanks,

 Dave Kautz



&gt; A couple of months back, on the Porsche list there was a similar discussion on 
&gt; synthetic oil, I saved a huge diatribe on synthetic oil.  I didn't want to 
&gt; waste bandwith by sending it out without seeing if people wanted it.  Or, if 
&gt; someone wants it seperately I'll send it straight to them.  It really is quite 
&gt; informative, but, the main subject is SLICK 50 (horrors).
