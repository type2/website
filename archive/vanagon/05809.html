&gt; 
&gt; Are we all humored, poemed, haikued, or burned out or what? Fridays
&gt; used to be so much fun 'round here....now the only thing i have
&gt; to look forward to on fridays is Joel's list....&lt;sigh&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Come on people, get with it...where's the songs, the mirth, the
&gt; picking on Martha's flannel shirts...
&gt; 
&gt; Does this mean I have to go to the book store to get a copy of
&gt; VW T&amp;A to get my jollies today????
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; A very bored Ric   :-(
&gt; 
&gt; 

Well .... I'm going to go see the Stones tonight and was supposed
to be off today.  But my boss just HAD to have me come to his class
this morning. :[ .  So I don't know whether to be happy or mad.
