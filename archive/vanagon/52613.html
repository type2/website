Fix it now!!!

This is a 'minor' situation that can (will) cause big problems;  a
stuck-open thermostat will increase engine wear like you wouldn't believe -
the poor thing never runs at design temperature, rather lt's constantly
running as if it has just been started (&amp; please don't ask how I found out,
at least it wasn't the Vanagon).  Also, thermostats have a bad habit of
getting 'lazy', i.e. they  open too soon (or actually never completely close
when cold) and the engine consequently starts taking a l.o.n.g time to warm
up.  Keep track of what your gauge is telling you, believe it, &amp; replace the
thermostat as soon as it starts getting lazy (cheap,~ $10, &amp; can be done on
a Vanagon in ~ 1/2 hour).
