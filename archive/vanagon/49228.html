 Is my '86 Wasserboxer's inadequate cooling partly due to trapped air in 
 upper engine compartment?  In aircraft baffling you must allow as much 
 air exit as entry; so I would think 3 loouvered cutouts each side of oil 
 tube access door extending to tail lights would help.  Has anyone else 
 ever considered this?  Rawson Murdock

Virtually all the engine cooling is done through the radiator.  Engine should
coool properly with no airflow in compartment at all.  The Vanagon cooling
system is actually oversized and I have personally driven in 123F temps with
the A/C on with no trouble.  If you are having cooling system problems,
something is wrong and needs to be corrected.
