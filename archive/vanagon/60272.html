Subject: Odd Sighting

This past weekend I spotted a passenger van which looked similar in design
to a Vanagon.  The labelling on it didn't reveal any manufacturer but the
model name was &quot;BESTA&quot;.  Looked like it could have been made by Lada or Fiat.

The sighting got the best of my curiosity.  Does anyone know who makes this?
