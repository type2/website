&gt;The gas stove (two burners and grill) folds away between the back of the
&gt;front passenger seat and the wardrobe; when erected it causes no
&gt;obstruction. The cook would normally sit on the driver's seat to work;
&gt;she could stand outside with the passenger's door open but would then
&gt;find the gas taps difficult to reach.

How interesting that the pronoun &quot;she&quot; would be automatically used with &quot;cook&quot;
