Subject:       Camping with the Pioneer

Like you all wanted to know, but perchance that a list member will be 
there...

I'll be camping/biking in Moab over the weekend most likely in the 
Pioneer (if I get the bolt fixed this week... FINALS!!  ACK!) 

So if yer ther...  Hollar!

I guess I don't feel all that bad about posting this, it's been a 
slow mail day on the list...
