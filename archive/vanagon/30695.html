Subject: Re: Heat in a '74

I also live in soggy Seattle and drive a '74. My heating system is in pretty 
good shape and once the engine gets good and warm, it will defrost if I'm 
cruising. But not during city driving or sitting in a traffic jam. So, I 
usually carry a towel or two.

&gt;Thanks for the tip.  It isn't really the heat I have a problem with, 
&gt;since it doesn't get below 35-40 too much here, but the defrost.  In the 
&gt;rain my windshield is a foggy mess.  I have a little fan attached to the 
&gt;dash, but it blows cold air on me as well.  Plus, it does nothing to melt 
&gt;the ice that occasionally forms on the windows.  Scraping removes it, but 
&gt;as I drive it reforms.  The heat gets to the interior ok, but without 
&gt;enough force to do much good.  It ends up fogging the windshield worse 
&gt;than if the heat were off.
