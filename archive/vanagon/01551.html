I had a similar problem with the rear brakes on my 1975 Camper. 

To get the drums off I tapped them from behind. There are holes in the
back, two to get to the adjusters and one to view the pad linings. Take
any one of them and insert a long screwdriver and just bang on it with a
hammer. Turn the wheel as you do this to unwedge the drum evenly.

My adjusters, too, were completely frozen. Liquid wrench did not help and
the vice grip almost busted the adjusters. Here is a solution that worked
for me. The adjusters rest in a metal block which in turn is attached to
the brake with two 17mm (wrenchsize) bolts. Try to screw off one of those
two bolts. If you can't, try to find one somewhere else. This bolt can now
be screwed into an adjuster. Once it reaches the bottom of the block, it
will push the adjuster out. 

Hope this is helpful. If I was not clear, let me know.
