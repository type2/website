Subject:      Fuel tank leaks -Reply

My local dealer, Metro VW, in Dallas, TX replaced all the leaking fuel lines on
my '86 GL (150K at time) both in the engine compartment and over the tank
without charge.   The service manager told me that VWoA had an advisory to
dealers to fix any and all fuel leaks on any and all VWs! Ya'll might want to
look into it.

BTW: I have heard that (in short) the new *reformulated* fuels are causing fuel
lines designed for the *original* ;) fuel formula to break down.

Also, the same dealer replaced my rear heater core last winter at no charge
under a similar directive by VWoA.

&gt;I just wanted to report to the group a success! My fuel tank no longer leaks
&gt;when full. But let me tell you, it is not a fun time doing the repair.
&gt;
&gt;I went to the dealer (who knew the parts to replace from memory - if that
&gt;tells you anything) to get the parts.  I wanted to replace everything if I
&gt;were going to the effort of pulling the tank, so about $45 later I left with
&gt; 4 seals the crossover vent tube. The parts guy suggested using a
&gt;transmission jack to raise and lower the tank.
&gt;
&gt;Well, let me tell you, dropping the tank is not the problem so much as how VW
&gt;chose to route the vent tubes and the general lack of clearance. It also
&gt;gives you a chance to find out first hand how much dirt collects in the
&gt;valley in the middle of the tank. Usually while on your back wrestling the
&gt;tank out and looking up. (wear goggles)
&gt;
&gt;I also replaced the cloth covered hoses to the vent tanks with fuel-injection
&gt;hose and replaced all the clamps with fuel-injection clamps. (Being
&gt;determined to erradicate all leaks.)
&gt;
&gt;The worst part was putting the tank back in because you have to route the
&gt;crossover vent tube OVER all sorts of plumbing, wires and cables. I am
&gt;convinced that black-forrest elves with long, thin arms did this job at the
&gt;factory.
&gt;
&gt;It was an interesting way to spend a day. It took me two days to get the
&gt;courage to fill the tank up - because I would have gone insane at the thought
&gt;of having to do it again if it still leaked. So far - no leaks!!
&gt;
&gt;For those of you considering it, it is not a job for someome without long
&gt;arms and patience. &lt;g&gt;
