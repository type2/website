Subject: Re: HELP!!-Pricing for '87 VW Camper

Seems like a lot to me too. I picked up an '86 Westy with 180K miles earlier
this year for approximately $4500 US with a few minor dings. I did have to
use my freq flier miles from Dallas to Little Rock,Ak to St. Louis,Mo to
Baltimore, Md to check out, buy and drive 1400 miles back (in two days). Keep
checking this listing, major city's classifieds, and rec.auto.vw newsgroup,
where I found mine :)  Good hunting, Vance
