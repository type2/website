My exhaust system is shot and I need to locate some pieces. Everything from
the heater boxes back needs to be replaced and I've found most of the stuff.
The problem is that the crossover pipe is over $500!!!!! My Vanagon is an '82
and looking over parts lists and such it looks like the pipe from a '79 Bus
is the same and it is half the price. Does anyone know the difference or
where I can get the pipe for less? Any advice would be great. E-mail me
direct if you would, and thanks in advance.



I am also interested in the answer to his question, so if anyone responds to
Jeff's question, please also post the answer to the Vanagon listserver.

Thanks
