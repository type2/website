Well, I happened to get them at Penninsula Automotive in Campbell, CA.
Out here in N. AZ, I haven't found anybody who carries them, other than
having a box of old, oily parts with a few mangled, drilled out ones in
the bottom.  Check in HVW mag.  I'm pretty sure you can find someone
who carries them there.
