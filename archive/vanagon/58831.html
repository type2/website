&lt;&lt; Has anyone had experience painting or treating the flexible air dam on
the bottom front of a late model Vanagon?  Mine is a 90 Carat and the
black is faded and ugly.  Thanks in advance &gt;&gt;

   Ed,  I've been using Westley's Black Magic, a thick silicone formula. 
It needs to be reapplied periodically, but does a nice job on the air dam
as well as rubber window moldings, door seals, etc.
