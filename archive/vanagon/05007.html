Subject: RE: 6-ply tires???


&gt; 
&gt; &gt; One thing to check. The Sears guys inflated my tires to 30 PSI all around,
&gt; &gt; rather than to the manual's specifications.
&gt; 
&gt; Sears said they wouldn't inflate them past 40, so I just let them put 
&gt; the 36 in them that they wanted to and then I put 45 in them when I got 
&gt; home.  Today I'll put 48 in them like is supposed to be.
&gt; 
&gt; 

	WARNING!!! 

	IF the max cold inflation pressure on the tire's sidewall
	is LESS THAN what your tire information sticker on the driver's
	door frame says... DO NOT INFLATE ABOVE THE MAX COLD INFLATION 
	PRESSURE!!!

	The VW sticker is specific to the tire specification issued by 
	VW for the Bus/Vanagon...
