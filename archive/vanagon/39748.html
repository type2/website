&gt;
&gt;Get over yourself, please! If you want a 100% serious, politically correct
&gt;
&gt;list, this isn't it. After all a lot of us are aging pot smoking hippies 
&gt;(who by definition aren't serious) who listen to the Dead and hang out in 
&gt;our VW vans....the only difference between what we were years ago, and who
&gt;
&gt;we are today is that we sit in our vans, joints hanging from our lips, and
&gt;a 
&gt;lap top attached to our cell phones....
&gt;
and we also work for ad agencies (have you ever wondered where all the groovy
rock scores come from man) and sit in front swivelling seats clutching
filofaxes and looking for windows of opportunity whilst listening to to Dylan
and Hendrix and checking out drivers of Spliff sorry SPLIT Screens whilst
watching reruns of Alices Restaurant......
