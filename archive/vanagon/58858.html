&lt;&lt; Has anyone had experience painting or treating the flexible air dam on
 the bottom front of a late model Vanagon?  Mine is a 90 Carat and the
 black is faded and ugly.  Thanks in advance, &gt;&gt;

I've had very good luck with some rubber/plastic treatment goop called &quot;Black
Chrome&quot;.  I did a little test a few years back on the black plastic fender
flare on my 86 Jetta (may it rest in peace) where I compared Armor-All, Black
Chrome, and two other similar products.  The BC was the clear winner then,
but there could be a better new product.
