Subject:       Re: insulation for Westy pop top

Hello Joerg.  A friend of mine had a '88 Westy and had one of these 
&quot;space blankets&quot; for the van.  It was a Westy part, and yes, it was 
expensive.  He used it in winters down to -25!  It was aluminum
foil covered.  

A suggestion.  Hardware stores sell these &quot;blankets&quot; by the foot.  
It's used for water heaters or garage doors for insulation.  In my 
opinion, this might be the same stuff used by Westfalia.  It sure 
looks like it anyway.  Just cut it out to size, and bungy cord it to 
the van.  A lot cheaper, and I'm sure just as effective.

Harry.

&gt; In a German Westfalia catalogue I saw a neat piece which goes around the 
&gt; tent part of the open pop top. It's like a large blanket or something 
&gt; which helps insulate the open top in cold weather. Trouble is, they want 
&gt; close to 600 Marks for it, about $ 400. 
&gt; Does anybody know if that part is available in the States, from an 
&gt; aftermarket supplier perhaps? Or, even better, does anybody want to sell 
&gt; me a use one? I am also looking for one of those guards for the top bed that 
&gt; prevent pillows (and kids =:O) from falling down.
&gt; 
&gt; Thx,
&gt; Joerg
