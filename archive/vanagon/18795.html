&gt;I have a slightly different problem with my '86 Camper GL.
&gt;My coolant light comes on every now and again although the coolant
&gt;temperature is, evidently, perfectly normal.  The coolant reservoir is full,
&gt;even over the tube to the overflow tank.

there is a tech bulletin on this (somewhere out on the gopher files) ...
it's not just the vanagons, but all vw models for certain years (and 86 is
one of them). one &quot;cure&quot; is to check the ground connection on that big
connector in the dash pod, where the circuit foil is connected to the wires.

on my 88 bus, i think it's the coolant level sensor itself that's gone a bit
wacko. sometimes it will come on, and if i shut the engine off, and restart,
the light will not come back on. but today, in traffic, i had to swerve
suddenly to avoid a nameless/faceless idiot (you know the kind: cut over in
front of you to make a turn immediately). and what-the-hell? the coolant light
came on and started blinking. ?? so i check the tanks and everything is ok.
i think the coolant level sensor is gone bye-bye (or i need to rattle the
dash pod wires again).

&gt;I lose virtually no coolant over extended periods of time.  I've not added a
&gt;total of a quart in over a year.

yup. that's about my loss rate. i'm still not used to this water-cooled stuff
... are we SUPPOSED to be losing coolant at all?? do LARB's (Large American
Road Barges) lose coolant? do Honda's lose coolant?  since i can't find any
leaks/seeps/weeps/drips/drops and there isn't any white smoke out the
tailpipe, and it's a very small amount ... i'm guessing it's just evaporating.

&gt;Now if I could just find a CHEAP (but reasonably conscientious) place in the
&gt;Washington, D.C., area (preferably Virginia suburbs) for some relatively
&gt;minor body work, I'd be a happy camper.  I can't believe they want almost
&gt;$500 to fix that little ding!

see if you can find a company called Press-a-dent (or something like that).
supposedly they do good, non-invasive surgery and it doesn't hurt the wallet
so much.
