&gt;When i hear of stories such as the T-boned MB, I get the heeby-jeebies.
&gt;Look at what most of us on the list are driving. Side impact beams in the
&gt;doors? nooooo. Crumple zone up front - about 8&quot;. :(
&gt;Maybe the relative position of the driver/pasenger with respect to the
&gt;front wheels and suspension might offer some protection...

my insurance company rates vanagons (and, i would assume, old model buses)
&quot;good&quot; protection in side impacts, because of the raised seating position.
as far as front impact, i have yet to see a bus or vanagon in the junkyards
with frontal impact damage ... they have all been side impact (into the
sliding door or opposite side), rear impact, or roll-overs (driving too fast
for conditions?).  now, obviously, i haven't seen ALL the buses, so it's a
very UNscientific survey ... especially since there are NOT that many buses
or vanagons in the bone-yards.

&gt;Although I did hear once that the injury/fatality rate (determined by
&gt;insurers), was lower in vanagons than other &quot;minivans&quot;. Could it be that
&gt;the old farts driving vanagons get into &quot;less serious&quot; trouble?

one of the reasons that i attribute my lack of accidents (in buses) is the
size (it's larger and easier for other folks to see me) and the small engines
(it's harder for me to get into trouble quickly). also, most folks tend to
grow accustomed to driving a very slow (relative to other traffic) vehicle
when they drive a bus, and perhaps are a bit intimidated by the perceived
size of the bus ... it does take a while to learn to parallel-park these
things :) ... so the bus drivers are a bit slower than other drivers.

which brings up a question: has anyone EVER gotten an insurance company to
tell you which vehicle is the safest? in 36 years of driving (i started young)
i've NEVER been able to get them to admit anything about the stats on a car.
all they will say is what it costs to insure it. :(
