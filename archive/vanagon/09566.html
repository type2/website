Subject: AZ Bus-in

Hey Dyer and Todd (and anybody else, for that matter), if you guys are 
serious about this, I'd like to get in on it.  I don't know much about 
AZ yet, though, so I can't make many recommendations.  There's also the 
little problem of my Bus being holed up in my garage, and not wanting 
to come out!  Hopefully I can get it fixed soon (don't know whats wrong 
yet), but if not, I'd use one of my other cars (yes, I admit to owning 
something other than VW's and Volvos!)  However, if you choose a spot 
close enough to Oak Creek, I can probably *push* it there!
