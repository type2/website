For the wind noise coming in the front door, if you can see or feel where the
wind is coming in, you might try aligning the door hinges to make the frame
fit better against the body.  Unless the rubber is shot, try this first:
 Roll up a  2X4 in a piece of carpet, so it won't scratch or dent your car,
and stick it in the bottom of the door (the open end, not the hinge end) and
push the door shut.  Once the door is firmly pressed against the 2X4, push
hard on the top of the door frame  until you feel some movement.  Pull out
the 2X4 and slam the door and take a ride and see if that didn't fix it
 Worked for me!
