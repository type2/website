Subject: Re: Ron's &quot;Free&quot; Eurovan


After driving the EV Camper 10,000 miles this year from California
to Chicago and back via the South and Southwest, I have to disagree
with most everything Tobin has to say. My only caveat is that my point
of reference for comparison is american type camper vans built on
US full size van chassis. The EV I drove is equipped similarly to
Tobin's, except it doesn't have ABS.=7F

&gt; Negative comments first:
&gt; It has absolutely no personality whatsoever.  Power everything, and the
&gt; power steering gives a &quot;dead&quot; feel with little feedback to the driver--I
&gt; hope this doesn't pose a problem when driving off-road.  It's quiet, but
&gt; the motor has a surprisingly high-pitched note to it.  The automatic
&gt; tranmission doesn't help matters--it'll be interesting to see how the auto
&gt; trans can deal with loose rough surfaces up hill on logging roads.  It was
&gt; raining steadily during the drive, and the wheels seemed to spin too
&gt; easily.  Torque-steer is noticeable when accelarating from a stop.  The
&gt; motor, at least as far as city driving goes, is really anaemic--and this=
 is
&gt; coming from someone who owns an air-cooled bus.  Sure, it's a bit quicker
&gt; than my own bus, but not by much.  I suspect a standard transmission would
&gt; go a long way towards improving performance in this regard.  Awkwardly,=
 the
&gt; automatic gear shift is mounted on the floor next to the driver.  Weird.
&gt; I don't think the plastic sorta-venetian blinds for the camper windows=
 will
&gt; last more than five seasons of camping.

One of the things I like about the EV is it's drivability. It never felt=
 &quot;almost
out of control&quot; in any situation, It handled high wind, too high a speed=
 into
a corner, city driving with no fear on my part. The steering is tight and
responsive, the brakes, chassis and tires handle the weight of the vehicle
with no problem.  On the other hand the suspension didn't do too well on
desert washboard. The whole vehicle feels like it's going to shake apart.
I would worry much less about the engine and transmission on the logging
roads than the suspension. I also suspect the mini-blinds will not last much
more than 5 years, only time will tell.

&gt; I found the driver's seat really uncomfortable--my back was hurting after
&gt; just a few miles.  To be fair, I'm sure I could fiddle with it to make it
&gt; more comfortable.  You can't do that great VW bus resting-your-forearms-
&gt; on-the-steering-wheel driving posture.  The steering wheel is out in front
&gt; of you like in a car.  You don't get that great &quot;happy bus&quot; feeling one
&gt; gets from being perched behind the wheel of a breadloaf bus.  With the
&gt; automatic transmission and the power steering, you don't drive this
&gt; thing--you just point it down the road.
&gt; (Donning Nomex underwear) Face it, kids, this thing is a big minivan with=
 a
&gt; camper interior. (Rolling on the ground to snuff out flaming clothing...)

I find the driver's seat very comfortable. This trip is the only time I=
 didn't get
a sore back driving 400-650 in a single day. The trick is to keep the seat=
 back
vertical and put your butt deep in the seat in order to keep your back=
 straight.
The steering wheel is noticably more horizontal than any sedan I've driven.
Despite my initial concern, I found the driving position very comfortable=
 and
relaxing.

&gt; Positive aspects:
&gt; It's very nice and quiet inside.  It has a heater.  :-)  I can steer with
&gt; one finger.  It has arm rests for the front seats.  Water doesn't come out
&gt; through the floor boards when driving wet roads, although that means I'd=
=7F
&gt; need to find another way to keep my feet cool.
&gt; It has a propane furnace with a thermostat to control temperature, and a
&gt; CO2 alarm to tell you you are about to die.  The large, front-opening=
 3-way
&gt; fridge is conveniently located forward in the galley, so that the driver
&gt; can reach back for a cold beer while driving.  It's got a shower-type=
 thing
&gt; that comes out by the raer hatch, and looks quite similr to Dave Garth's
&gt; hot-water shower he hooked up in his water-pumper westy and showed off at
&gt; the first annual Big Sur camp-out in 1995.  Maybe winnibago saw Dave
&gt; Garth's shower pictures on the web?  The area under the open rear hatch is
&gt; *huge*--I've never seen a hatch so large, and I have to say the pistons
&gt; that keep it from bonking your head are awfully stiff.  It's a bit of a
&gt; strain to open and close the hatch, especially if you're carrying=
 something
&gt; else at the same time.

The heater is nice, but the factory installed thermostat cycles on and off=
 much
too frequently. I replaced it with an adjustable model with works much=
 better.
Working overnight in cool temperatures (25-40 degrees) it used between 1/8
and a 1/4 of tank of propane. The &quot;shower-type thing&quot; in the back hatch is
cold water. I never used it. Another fellow EVer we met had a solar shower
bag. I agree about the rear hatch.

&gt; It has rear seat head rests.

The rear seat head rests obstruct vision out the rear window, and also need
to be removed in order to open the lower bunk. I left them at home.

&gt; They also added a bra after I warned them about flying rocks the size of
&gt; softballs, and how they will be covering the cost of all damages incurred
&gt; to the van.  :-)

The camper didn't have a bra on the front. As a result there are a couple
paint chips on the front. That and the sliding door netting are the first=
 things
I ordered when I got back. I'd recommend the netting, especially if you're
going into mosquito country.
