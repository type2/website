Subject:       Out of the snow at last!

Happy New Year to all!

I haven't yet caught up with all the list mail, but thought I'd post 
a note about our holidays in the Westy!

We spent 7 nights with our two cats and an electric heater in 
relative comfort, although Christmas Eve was -16C and a little cool 
inside the van. Icicles were 3&quot; thick and reached the ground all 
around the van! The van did fairly well in the snow, although we did 
manage to bury her in a snowbank a block from home. I did buy some 
chains, but never had to use them. We now want a syncro more than 
ever!

We arrived home New Year's Eve to about 6ft of snow, and no power 
until last night. Cooked breakfast in the Westy, even had to grind 
coffee with a mortal &amp; pestel! 

VW Content: Does anyone know how the Propex heater compares to a 
1500W electic, in terms of heat output? At -16C, the electric could 
barely maintain 15C (~60f) inside the van.
