Subject: Language Designation Filters


As a result of the plethora of responses from Rusty Van Bondo regarding
the use of languages other than the Vanagon Sanctioned Officially
Recognized Communication Standard of English, the following protocall
shall be effective immediately:

1. Messages in english will be allowed as before

2. If a language other than english is being used then a prefix code
must be placed at the beginning of each subject header, for example:
	[S] - Spanish
	[Fr] - French ...[F] cannot be used as it is already used
	as a designator for &quot;fun&quot;, and as we all know from high
	school/college, French is not fun.
	[GER] - German
	[RN] - Red Neck, especially that dialect prevalent in the
	Tusks are looser part of Allybammah...

3. Should a list member request a translation of any message written
in non-english (ie: above), the original poster will be required to
provide a translation of the text in question for ALL of the above
heretofore previously recognized languages. The same will hold true
for posters of responses to non-english querries should someone request
a translation.

4. Languages other than the heretofore previously recognized languages
may be added to the list as time goes on by a 2/3rds majority of
the then present list members voting. This vote can only be held on
the second Tuesday of each week assuming the individual(s) requesting
such a vote provide a &quot;Request to Change Language Petition&quot; in ALL
recognized languages (including English) to ALL list members exactly
30 days prior to the vote.


Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
