Subject: Clock rebuilders?

The clock on Opie ('68 crew cab) needs to be cleaned and lubricated.  The 
dial is OK, so it doesn't need restoration.  Can anyone recommend someone to 
provide this service?  I found someone locally to clean and lube the speedo 
(in TX they have to be licensed by the state), but he doesn't do clocks.

TIA,
