Subject: Re: Locking engine compartment latch?

i have a black plastic locking engine hatch (think that would be correct
for your 76') that i have on my 73'. I would actually like to find the
correct chrome locking latch. If you've got a locking chrome one w/ keys,
want to trade?

As i said in previous post, i beleive you can get a lock from RMMW.

&gt;I have wanted a lock for the engine compartment for years.
&gt;If anyone knows a source, please post it!  ('76 Westfalia)
