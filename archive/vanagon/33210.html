Subject: Humor: Microsoft Car (fwd)


&gt;From the Feb 1996 &quot;Car and Driver&quot;:

Ten things that would be different if Microsoft started building cars:

1. A particular model year of car wouldn't be available until after that
year instead of before it.

2. Every time they repainted the lines on the road, you'd have to buy a
new car.

3. Occaisonally, your car would die for no reason, and you'd have to
restart it.  For some strange reason, you'd just accept this.

4. You could only have one person in a car at a time, unless you bought
Car 95 or Car NT.  But then you'd have to buy more seats.

5. Sun Motorsystems would make a car that was powered by the sun, twice
as reliable and five times as fast - but it would only run on 5 percent
of the roads.

6. The oil, gas, engine and alternator warning lights would be replaced
with a single &quot;General Car Fault&quot; warning light.  

7. People would get excited about the &quot;new&quot; features in Microsoft cars,
forgetting completely they had been available in other cars for years.

8. We'd all have to switch to Microsoft gas.

9. The U.S. government would be getting subsidies from an automaker,
instead of giving them.

10. New seats would force everyone to have the same-sized butt.
