Subject: Split US spec bumper bit wanted

HELP! A friend in SSVC desperately needs a centre towel rail tube for a '66
Split so he can finish his US spec bumpets ready for show this season. Front
bumper, he has the bumper and side towel rails and the overiders, but needs a
rust free, non dented (or NOS ha dream on) centre tube to finish. Anyone help?
I will arrange etc and he will pay shipping etc, or I can enlist the aid of
some NEATO friends maybe to help with passing it along...? He'd like to have
the van kitted out for the new season. Apparently the year does not reallly
matter - they were standard during sixties..? He would consider the whole
bumper but shipping gets complex and pricey...
Incidentally US spec bumpers are very sought after in UK and people enjoy that
rather different sense of style...it offends a few purists but if ya like it
drive it! And bumpers are only accessories .._dot_come to that aren't vans
accessories?
Hoping someone can help....Dave
