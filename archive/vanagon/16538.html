Subject: Re: Coolant Temperature Gauges

&gt;&gt;I have replaced the sending unit (start from cheap) and this has made no
&gt;&gt;impact on the gauge.  The coolant gauge and fuel tank gauge are a single
&gt;&gt;unit on this car and have to be replaced together--$90.

&gt;&gt;I don't have any test equipment, what do you guys think the chances are of
&gt;&gt;this being a defective gauge?

First, remove the wire that goes into the sending unit, and ground it.
(Ignition on, engine NOT running). If the gauge jumps to full hot, the sender
is bad. If not, either the wiring or the gauge is bad. To continue the test,
get into the dash and find where the sender wire goes into the gauge. Ground
the sender post. If the gauge jumps to hot, the wiring is bad and you need to
look for loose or dirty connections. If the gauge does not move, the gauge is
not working.   Cheap tests!
