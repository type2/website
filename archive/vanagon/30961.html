Subject: Re: Might Need Help! Are you along I-40???


&gt;Under the &quot;Where's your compassion&quot; heading:
&gt;
&gt;Presently planning a trek across the US in a recently
&gt;purchased Vanagon (maybe . . . this is all contract
&gt;pending!).  If you live along the I-40 corridor and
&gt;would be willing to serve as a &quot;Safe Haven&quot; in the
&gt;event said vanagon bites the big one, please
&gt;contact me asap with your addr. and telephone
&gt;number.  Being stranded for a day or so isn't so
&gt;bad when you have a friendly soul to yuk it up with.
&gt;
&gt;(and remember, it's x-mas, so be christmas-y).
&gt;
&gt;I am heading out within the next 48 hours so let
&gt;me know.  Email asap with your name, general location
&gt;and tele. (did I say that already??)

Hey William, when passing through Memphis, if you have any problems,
call Gary Bowers at Bowers Garage.  He works exclusively on VWs of all
types.  Fantastic mechanic, and person.  I'd give you my number, but
we aren't going to be around X'mas time.  Happy motoring!! (oops,
didn't Esso become Exon?)
