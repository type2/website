This is only tangentially (tm) VW related, but...

What is the accepted means for counting &quot;hits&quot; on a Wb page?

Looking at the netcom ftp logs, I grep'ed over 400 hits, but when I
grep'ed for just html, it was only 120 or so.  What is the accepted 
means for counting, for bragging rights, etc.

Also, whats the best way to count hits under the http convetion, which
my calweb site uses.  Someone told me of a cgi-bin thing to use, but
I forgot.  I Think it was Schwarze, who has an odometer on his...

Thanks!

OBVW- Put a new gas filler neck seal on, got it from WCM, fits much better,
went on much better, and the rubber is more supple than the one from
wolfsburg west, which _broke_.  Yes, this big rubber donut broke on me!

I also got 6V bulbs for the fog lights, and a light for a license plate light
jobber which I'm going to adapt for my bus...
