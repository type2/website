&gt; car from, say , downtown to a major suburb like Surrey or Twawwassen is 
&gt; at least 1 1/2 hours and usually more since some bozo typically runs out 
&gt; of gas in the middle of a critical bridge along the way.  Three hours or 
&gt; more every day driving in rush hour traffic jams?  Multiply that out over 
&gt; a working life, and that's more of my life than I'm willing to give up.
