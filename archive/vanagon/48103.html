Subject: Portable fridge advice wanted

I'm after some advice on a fridge for my van (1989 Transporter -
not sure what these are called in the US). 

I want a portable fridge. I camp away from campsites so I can't
rely on campsite AC power. I want to be able to run the fridge
for (say) 2 days without 12V alternator current. I want to run it
while I'm asleep so it must be quiet and not gas me to death in
the night. I'm a lazy bugger so I don't want to have to
continually jump up and down switching between power sources.

I think I've got 3 choices:

1. Portable Gas/12V absorption fridge. But what about fumes
during the night? I phoned Electrolux - they say it's not a
problem so long as I leave a window open a little bit in the van.
But other vendors say not to use portable gas fridges in a van
under any circumstances - ventilation will not be sufficient.
What about the risks of leaving the gas on while travelling? What
is power consumption like at 12V DC?

2. Thermoelectric Coolbox (eg Koolatron). Will reduce interior
temperature to 40 deg below ambient - frozen milk for my
cornflakes in the morning, spoilt steak in the afternoon? What's
the current consumption like?

3. Compressor fridge (Engels/Norcold). Cost more than the van
(well... nearly). Again, what's the current consumption like? How
bulky are they? Is the compressor noisy?

I'd be very grateful for advice/feedback/anecdotes to help me
make my choice.  I'm off round Scotland soon - hey, why am I
worried about a fridge?
