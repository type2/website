Subject: Collision repair- large mammal.


Back in July we got hit by a deer.  No, really!!  IT ran into the
passenger side, rear.  was actually trying to leap OVER the van and
hit full on into the large back window.  my wife was sitting at that
window and saw the deer crunch into it-- about 6 inches from her
face.  still have the nose prints on the window.  the glass did not
break but the back vent area caught the deer and did body damage to
the vent area.

it is now in the shop.  a replacement body panel was ordered but the 
wrong side came in.  so, in the interest of time, they have 
straightened out the panel and applied body filler.  this isn't great 
but i felt behind the panel and they did a really nice job of 
straightening it out so the filler thickness should be minimal. 

i am also having them grub out any seam rust in the van.  this is a
problem common after about 8 years and mine was present but minimal.  
they sandblasted out the seams, stripping out the old seam sealer, 
primed them with a rust arresting primer, and it is awaiting paint.

based upon how rusty my Camry is, albiet with 100K more miles on it,
i'd say the van is holding up well.  it is by no means concours--
not when it is a daily driver with 2 kids.  but with all the bashing
about it does, it is very solid.  and besides, with the trick 
mods inside, i could never bear to sell it.  :)
