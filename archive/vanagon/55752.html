&gt; &gt; &gt; How about doing some phenomenal trip with both groups in the year 2000...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; How about a marathon trip to somewhere REALLY obscure for most of
&gt; &gt; &gt; us - like Tierra del Fuego?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Food for thought....

&gt; &gt; Today my wife and I started our Spanish Language Study program.
&gt; &gt; 2000 or bust, here we come.

&gt; I've just finished reading Ted Simon's &quot;Jupiter's Travels&quot; (again!) -
&gt; around the World on a Triumph motorbike in 4 years in the mid '70s.
&gt; Great descriptions of  'epics' at the bottom of S. America.  I guess
&gt; this idea came up at the right time!
&gt; 
&gt; Count us in!  Now how the hell do I get the van across from Europe?
&gt; 
&gt; BTW my wife is Spanish, so we have at least one  interpreter!
&gt;

FYI Try reading &quot;Investment Biker&quot; by Jim Rogers. Yes that's &quot;Biker&quot; not
&quot;Banker&quot;.
He and girl friend went from Ireland to Japan and back overland on BMW
bikes then went Ireland to Cape of Good Hope (overland), Australia (land
and sea), Tierra del Fuego and finally Alaska (overland) on BMW bikes.
IMHO Written pooly but a good read anyway.
