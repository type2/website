My dad was mentioning to me that he thinks that the chrome on my bus 
isn't on most of the other busses he has seen.  I have the chrome around 
the windows, which I know it common, but on the little bump from the 
bottom, to the top, below the windows, but where it is still white top 
has chrome all the way around the bus.  Is this common, or have we just 
not noticed it on other busses?      Dallas
