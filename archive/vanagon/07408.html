So Jim Have-it-your-way Macklow says:
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I suppose all you need to do is warm up that area of van.  I suggest buying
&gt; a 99 cent Whopper from Burger King, and duct-taping it to the appropriate spot.
&gt; 
&gt; That should warm up the sheet metal, allowing the compressor to engage.
&gt; 

Wow!, I was wondering why people paid good money for those thing.  Certainly not
to stick them in their mouths?  ;P
