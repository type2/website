Subject: Re: '71 single cab pickup?

My advice (yeah, like I'm an expert):

A. You don't want a single cab. Why don't you send me the number so I can 
call the guy and tell him to stop advertising such cr*p. (Heck, I might 
even drive out to CA and tell him in person) 8)

or B. Call the guy and tell him it's sold as long as it's not ate up in 
rust; then get in the car and drive fast. 

Good luck! Joe 8)

P.S. I'm pretty much the idiot Muir was writing to...so take my advice at 
your own risk.

&gt; It caught my eye, but the wife says &quot;I don't wanna pickup; I wanna
&gt; splittie.&quot;  I'm still thinking tho.  If it's in decent shape, is this
&gt; a deal not to be passed up?  I suspect they're fairly rare, but how
&gt; much so?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

&gt; 
&gt; P.S. It's near Auburn, CA.  If you are interested (and I don't wind up
&gt; with it :-), drop me a line and I'll point you at it.
