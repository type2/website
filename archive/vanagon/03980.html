	D Frau is a bright yellow 1973 bus in Cleveland, Ohio.  Originally
from somewhere in Florida but purchased in New Jersey.  Aside from wall to
ceiling carpet she sports an easy chair, futon deck, tool storage (under
deck) and the world's cheesiest stereo (i'd much rather listen to the
engine anyway - 1974 type 1 1600 - easy to fix).
	While we seem to be conversing in women's speak i'll add my two
cents.  Next summer i plan to put a couple planter boxes (with assorted
flowers and vegetables) in the side rear windows... 
	but on a more technical note.. anybody ever have reverse shut the
engine down. Of course i just plucked the wires off the tranny but i'd like
to get my backing lights back sometime.  Is it a sensor or a short (getting
around to checking sometime soon)?????
