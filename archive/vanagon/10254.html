  I wouldn't attempt cutting a hole in your 69 for
&gt; the poptop.  If you make a mistake, you're screwed.  It might leak, and I
&gt; think the roof around the opening is different than if you just cut a hole
&gt; in it.  Eg. I think there's some bracing or extra metal there.  Look closely
&gt; at the opening on one of the parts buses first and make sure this is
&gt; something you really want to do.  Besides, the poptop was an option anyway.
&gt; Not all campers had them.

  I think the way Westfalia did those pre-74 pop-top openings was to use a 
  sunroof body, without the sunroof. My '72 Westfalia &lt;with forward hinged
  pop-top&gt; had a &quot;double-roof&quot; behind the opening which formed a cavity like
  the one that a sunroof would be withdrawn into. It was a good place to carry
  skis, by the way.

  Soooo, if your present bus has a sunroof, you could go ahead with the 
  conversion to pop-top.
