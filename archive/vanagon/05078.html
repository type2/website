&gt; hi there,
&gt;    in reply to where to fix fuel gauge...seems that this is not an uncommon
&gt; problem, tho my '70(Old Bess) never had this prob.  Anyway, someone will

...rest of reply deleted...

&gt;                                   D.R.

On the 81, the sending unit sits on top of the tank, which resides underneath
the passengers.  It's a fair bear to get out until you've done it several times as
numerous hoses, filler pipe, electrical connects have to be disconnected first.

Once down though the sending unit is removed by hitting the &quot;tangs&quot; with a
screwdriver until it's loose.  They use a skinny (~1/8&quot;) metal rod attached to a
float which over time develops a slight bend which will skew the signal sent to
the guage.  Bending the rod very slightly gives big changes in guage readings.

Test the sending unit for EMPTY installed back in the tank to get a true reading
with the electrical leads hooked up and the key on.  Move the rod all the way to
the top of it's travel to find FULL.  There are some metal arms at the top and 
bottom of the sending unit  that inhibit full travel of the rod.  Again, bending 
these very slightly gives big guage changes.  Be gentle, if you break them off
you've just earned yourself a trip to the Parts Store for a new one.

Take your time adjusting the rod/arms since you only want to do this once.  I've 
gotten fairly proficient at the process only because I couldn't find the leak in the
tank the first dozen tries ;).

Any aircooled Vanagon should be setup the same way.
