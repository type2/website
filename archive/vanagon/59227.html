Subject: fixing leaks from head bolts

&gt;I have found a wet trail sourced at the top front and rear
&gt;head bolts on the passenger side(no apparent leak from top middle &gt;bolt). 
&gt;So if anyone's been there and done that on this, how do I fix it??

I had a similar leak on my 87 and fixed it successfully. Here's what I
recommend:

1. Get new head nuts from the dealer. Don't reuse your old ones.
2. Drain coolant from engine.
3. Remove one of your leaky nuts, scrape away any old sealant and dry
everything really well.
4. Apply the sealant, don't overdo it. Fel Pro bolt prep is what I used.
5. Torque new nut to specs (37 ft lb).
6. Repeat for the next leaky nut.
7. Let things sit for a while so that sealant sets.
8. Refill with coolant and bleed air from system.
