Subject: Re: Some 1600cc questions.

&gt; I pulled apart an AS21 based engine yesterday and the case, pistons 
&gt; and bores are in excellent condition, but the whole thing has been 
&gt; running really rich. The layer of carbon on the pistons and head 
&gt; is amazingly thick! 
&gt;
&gt; I noticed as well that the oil deflector plate has been installed
&gt; the wrong way round, probably not a problem but more a comment on the
&gt; care (!?) that the previous builder put the engine together with.
&gt;

Do you mean air deflectors?  The 1600 don't have no oil deflector.  And Muir
says the air deflector is totally important, though I've no experience with
one that's been goofed up.

&gt; Which leads to some questions. This engine has a 050 dizzy fitted.
&gt; Now Muir says this is a no no for this engine, as it dosn't retard
&gt; #3. Has anyone run a 1600 with a 050? Any problems?
&gt;
&gt; I would have to use the alternator from the 2 litre with the 1600.
&gt; I pressume that as the later 1600s had alternators, that they
&gt; were of the same type for both engines?
&gt;

The mount is different?  I use the 50 amp Motorola.

&gt; Having changed the engine mounting arrangement to suit the type 4
&gt; style (i.e.) solid mountings on the chassis, rubber mounting on the
&gt; engine, I now find the mounting bar for the 1600 is the other way round
&gt; (rubber on the chassis mounts, bolts on the engine). I'm unwilling to hack
&gt; the mountings around again, so is there a quick and easy solution to this?  
&gt;

You on fresh ground here, but I'm interested in how the type 4 fits.  Does
the bell housing fit directly? wOw.

&gt; (The more questions I come up with the more I start to realise I'd
&gt;  better re-mortgage the cat and go the 2 litre route, but anyway any
&gt;  answers would be appreciated)  
&gt;

Your cat is that valuable?  Ours just purrs and rubs it's head on everything.

&gt; TIA
&gt; cheers
