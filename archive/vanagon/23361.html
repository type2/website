Subject: Bug &amp; Bus winches



To All:

When installing an electric winch on an early bug or bus the usual method is
to fabricate a mount that utilizes the front torsion-tube mounting points.
 Unless you are working in the vertical (not recommended unless you have a
good ramp to come down on... and a gimbal-mounted battery), the two-ton units
can drag you out of most swamps.

But the problem with using a winch often involves where to attach the cable
rather than the winch.  Since the only real tree in Baja is busy shading the
plaza at San Ignacio, finding someplace to fasten the cable can stretch your
ingenuity to the snapping point.

Most of us just dig in.  Bury one of the spares, with the cable latched to
the tire-iron under it.  Pile on the rocks.  Sit on it.  

Some guys carry two-foot square plywood panels.  Handy for camping but not
much good as an anchor, except in pure sand.

Rope is handy.  A 100' hank of 5/8&quot; trucker's rope can solve a world of
problems, such as extending your cable to that big rock over there.  Don't
worry about the rope; it'll take about a ton of pull before it snaps.  THEN
you can worry about it, as in how fast you can duck.  (If you're lucky it
won't eat the windscreen.)

The truth is, if you've got a high-lift jack you'll be on your way long
before you can figure out where to anchor your winch cable.  But then,
winches are buf.  Macho to have a winch on the front of your rig.  And big,
BIG tires.   Jacks are just...  jacks.   And you were really only running for
the experience, right?

If your engine is still running, you're still in the race.  Jack that puppy
up, get some traction under it, and Drive ON!  (You EVER see a winch on the
typical Bajanese pickup?  Rusty old '50 Ford, drum of gas in back, two
cowboys in the cab along with a ton of gear.  Wave them down.  They'll pull
your sorry ass out, point you toward the nearest La Quinta motel with a hot
tub and cold beer, while they drive on.  To them, it's not The Baja with
capital letters, it's home.  The most modern tool in their truck is a lot of
common sense, rare stuff in modern-day Ami-Rica.)

But you say you've got trees?  Ummm...  maybe you COULD use a winch.  But the
ones I prefer are spelled differently.
