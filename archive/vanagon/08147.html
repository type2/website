Subject: RE: '74 bus, low compression

Yeah it's a tad low......Type IV's should return around 110-120 psi (from
practical experience I can check the specs if you like).  Although the MAJOR
problem signifying Engine wear (or a dicky valve) is when the compressions
*vary* between the cylinders by more than about 10 - 15 psi.

Have you tried with a couple a compression testers? (fingers crossed if you've
used only one it might be the guage that's faulty....)

If you have the first thing that springs to mind from your description is the
heads - how much did you have cut out of them? (hard to imagine enough was
taken out to cause this though...)

Did you change the rods and/or pistons?....if the motor was a 1700 and someone
has supplied/fitted 2 litre pistons (which are OK for diameter and will
physically fit in a 1700 - but the gudgeon pin sits lower in the piston) you
might well get the sort of effect you are talking about??????
