In a message dated 96-10-08 23:23:58 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; Noise in 4th gear only! Mainshaft bearing or 3/4 slider hub shot. &gt;&gt;

Dennis sometimes it is hard to hear the bearing until you shift to 4th.I had
a bad pinion (thrust side) bearing go bad in my 84 and you couldn't hear it
until 40 mph in 4th(the races were pitted).I have rarely found the mainshaft
bearings bad.
