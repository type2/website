Glen,
         Thanks for the info.  I am interested to know how you removed the
4&quot; of tube at the junkyard.  I know of a decent one about 30 miles away
and would like to know what tools I will need and procedure.  Did you
also get the boot at the junkyard.  I assume your mechanic drilled a whole
so you would avoid dropping the engine. 

                                                              Thank you,

                                                                         Patrick Flynn
