&gt;Answer to question 1.
&gt;Always buy parts that are designed for the year and model vehicle that
&gt;you are putting them in. This is espicially true for aftermarket parts,
&gt;but holds true for OEM parts as well. There are some parts for
&gt;different year vehicles that will work but unless your parts dealer is
&gt;well versed in which parts fall into this category play it safe and buy
&gt;parts for the vehicle make and model year.
        Yes, well, that's my problem. I've always bought parts for a '70
bus, found out yesterday the engine was originally from a '70 Type 1. Good
ol' Bob Hoover said I'm probably missing a shim-sounds exactly right for my
problem. In fact, I reasearched this last summer while still in Cal, all my
parts sources got blank looks on thier faces when I mentioned shims for the
Dist. Drive.

Peace,
