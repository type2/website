Subject: To Lower, or Not to Lower? 

Thanks Sarah for the suport, thanks BusBoys for the info, Steven J. lighten
up. All this name calling over a few inches, Wow!  Not sorry I started it
though.  Opinions and diversity are what's made the VW what is is today.  I
guess I fall some where in the middle,  I strongly agree with Sarah that what
I do with my car(s) is my buisness, Yet on the other hand I love, and I'm
dedicated to the &quot;restoration and preservation&quot; of all VW's so I, like Steven
would Beg others to preserve their Vw's, not cut, chop, or mutalate a
perfectly good VW. (there are pleny of rusty, wrecked, and already jacked up
VW,s out there for those who can't refrain).  I'm probably gona lower my '69
SCab a few inches in the front (tired of it looking like a Super Beetle)
 Yea, its been restored Resto Custom, Stock color, bolt on custom parts only,
all stock parts saved and stored so it can return to stock if I ever want.
 Wish me many happy &quot;butt scraps&quot; SJ,  opinions &amp; differences accepted,  Just
keep it fun.
