Subject: Re: Factory Tools List Vanagon

DEFINATELY!!


&gt;I was wondering if anyone would be interested in a complete VW tools
&gt;list for 1963-1967 micros. Or does anyone need to know that a
&gt;VW 737 is a Vent wing appliance?
&gt;VW739/1 (Glass installing tool)
&gt;Or the VW codes for all the paint? (Yellow-green is LKM 12)
&gt;This list would take me quite a bit of time to organise/enter, and
&gt;it would be fairly long, and I'm not even sure if the nomenclature
&gt;is still valid, (Although it would appear so from the vanagon tool 
&gt;list.)
