Subject: Big news for a sad goodbye

Everybody,
 (big news is later in this message, so you have to read this stuff first)

I just wanted to thank everyone on the vanagon list for contributing in
their own way to what has got to have been one of the coziest, friendliest,
and most supportive corners of the internet.  You've all been great, and
I'm going to miss those of you who go on a different path through the
split.  Gerry deserves all of our respect, since without his nurturing and
commitment, we would never have had the opportunity to share all that we
have.  Thank you Gerry, and I hope the beer holds out for a good long time!

On a personal note, thanks to all those who have helped me along the way,
including those who have opened their homes to Christa and me on our road
trips.   I didn't know *anything* about VW buses when I joined the list 2
years ago--except that I'd known for years that I had to have one--and you
folks helped me through buying, fixing, and learning about my bus.  I am
pleased to say that I am now a confident (even if sometimes incompetent)
mechanic, and the bulk of my learning has come from the list.  Knowing the
vanagon list was there for me gave me the confidence to take my
then-newly-acquired 1976 camper on a 15,000 mile trip around North America.
The supportive feedback from the list spurred me to complete my 14 part
report on that trip--a report that when finished appraoched 100 pages in
length and the writing of which helped me avoid depression while searching
for work on my return home.  Without the vanagon list, the Inuvik trip
would never have become anything like the outrageous event it has become.

And quite possibly, without the vanagon list Christa and I might not be
expecting our first child in February.

Whoa!  Bet that got your attention!  I'm not pulling your chains on this,
by the way.  How could a electronic mail mailing list play a part in us
conceiving our first (much-wanted) baby?  It's quite simple, really: the
community and support provided by the list has allowed Christa and me to
keep our camper on the road.  On the weekend of May 19, we took an
overnight trip in our camper up into the mountains along the Sea-to-Sky
highway north of Vancouver.  At about 8:15 am the next morning, a few
hundred million pounds of rock slid off the slope above the highway south
of us, burying the highway under 50 feet of rock and cutting us off from
Vancouver.

We spent that day doing what any young couple in a VW camper would do when
marooned up in the mountains, cut-off from the city and unable to report
for work.  Oh, and it was a looong day!

Oh, sure, we would have conceived sooner or later, some place or other, but
the point is the vanagon list had kept us enthusiastic enough about our bus
that when Christa phoned Saturday to tell me she got her shifts changed so
that she would be getting off work at 3:00 pm and wouldn't have to report
back until 3:00 pm the next day, we both wanted to pile into our camper for
a quick over-night trip up into the mountains.

So I want to thank the vanagon list and geologic faulting for both coming
together so nicely.

We don't have a name for the baby yet, but we're calling it &quot;Rocky&quot; for
now.  ;-)  ;-)

Thanks everybody!  May you all run smooth, cool, and rust-free.

See you down the road!  (Northward ho!)

Tobin
