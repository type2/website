Subject:      on the road

        I'm wondering the minimum tools and spare parts savvy list members
would recommend that a mechanical neophyte bring along on a 1,500 mile
round trip in an '84 Westy. In preparation for our vacation, we had it to
the shop for a checkup and it got all passing grades, but you never know .
. . .Although I wouldn't be able to do much about a problem, I'd like to be
prepared.

        Parts-wise, I'm wondering about specific belts, hoses, clamps, etc.
that I may want to stock. I usually carry a small toolbox along with those
old standbys, duct tape, clothes hanger wire, four-leaf clover and -- when
all else fails -- and my trusty &quot;VISA&quot; wrench (along with traveler's
checks).

        Thanks for your help. See you on the road (and hopefully not
alongside it).
