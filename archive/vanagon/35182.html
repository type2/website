Subject: 	How to win friends and read fire extiguisher labels

OK here it goes:

Fire Extinguishment Theory:

To extinguish a fire interrupt the essential elements of fire.  Doing =
one of these will extinguish flame.=20

1. Reduce the Temperature
2. Remove the Fuel
3. Exclude Oxygen
4. Stop the Uninhibited Chain Reaction  (Note: This method of =
extiguishment is effective on gas and liquid fuels, b/c they must flame =
to burn.  HOWEVER,  smoldering fires are not easily extinguished, b/c =
the moment the the hologenated hydrocarbons (HALON) is shut off, air =
again has access to the smoldering fuel and it continues to burn.

Class A:  Ordinary Combustibles  (wood, paper, rubber,plastic)
Class B:   Flammable Liquids (liquids, greases, gases)
Class C:  Electrical Equipment (live electrical equipment)
Class D: Combustible Metals (magnesium, titanium, zirconium and other    =
                                       &quot;iumns&quot;.

Class A extinguishers are rated form 1-A to 40-A depending on their =
size.  For a 1-A rating, 1 1/4 gallons of water are required.  a 2-A =
rating requires 2 1/2 gallons( or twice the 1-A capacity...see the =
trend?).  Therefore, a dry chemical extinguisher rated 10-A is =
equivalent to five 2 1/2 gallon water extinguishers.

Class B extinguishers are rated from 1-B to 640-B.  This is a =
complicated UL rating system best described by this example. A 60-B =
extinguisher will extinguish 60 suare feet of fire when used by a non =
expert.

Class C refers to whether the extinguishing agent conducts electricity.  =
You wouln't want to spray a flaming engine with a class A agent unless =
you wanted to chance electrocution or shock.

Don't worry about Class D because it is improbable that you would fight =
this fire anyway.

SO:

A fire extiguisher is rated as follows. =20

                4-A 20-B:C

This extinguisher should extinguish a Class A fire that is four times =
