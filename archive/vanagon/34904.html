Subject: Re: 84 Vanagon GL Update &amp; VW Tool ?

&gt;The problem is that the PO started disassembling the tranny and split the 
&gt;gearbox from the ring &amp; pinion area.  In order to replace the gasket 
&gt;between the two, I need to remove the ring &amp; pinion with the 'special' VW 
&gt;tool.  Has anyone ever bought one of these??  I don't have the tool # 
&gt;with me, but how much is this critter?  Thanks in advance,  8-)


You could try:  Baum Tools
                P.O. Box 5867
                Sarasota, FL 34277
                1-800-848-6657

A catalog for both aircooled and watercooled VW factory tools is $15 (or
free/less if you have a shop).  I haven't purchased anything from Baum so I
can't comment on their prices.  My guess is they are at least less than
buying straight from a VW dealer.
