Subject: RE: Yassir Arafat and VW Vans (F)


&gt;I saw in the paper this week that Yassir Arafat's Mercedes got into an
&gt;accident. The article buried on the inside section was real brief but
&gt;mentioned that the Mercedes got smacked into by a &quot;van.&quot; Accordingly, there
&gt;was a momentary confusion and worry that he was being attacked/ambushed. As
&gt;the incident was sorted out it was a ordinary collision situation.


One of the few instances where a hard collision would IMPROVE the state
of the world.
