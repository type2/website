Subject: Re: Replacing Stock 82 Van mirrors w/stronger model

&gt;I have an '82 Vanagon w/side mirrors that cant stay put in
&gt;winds over 70 mph (i.e. 10mph headwind while going 60...) If
&gt;I tighten the springs in the mirrors, I run the risk of ripping
&gt;the peg out of the molded plastic (done this once already...)
&gt;
&gt;Is there a later year vanagon mirror that fits the same screw
&gt;hole pattern or an OEM replacement that isnt such a brain-
&gt;damaged design?
&gt;
&gt;Any info appreciated!  Thanx!

Hey Matt,

I had the same problem last weekend while driving head on into a wind storm.
The mirrors basically folded against the body of the Vanagon. Other cars
zipped by us with their mirrors doing just fine. Let me know what you find
out if anything as I have no solution. Sorry.
