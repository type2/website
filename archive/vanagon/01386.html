Subject: engine substitutions

A couple thoughts based on recent subject comments:
1.  Engine substitution should not be thought of as a way to save money.  Re-
pairing the original engine is going to be less expensive in almost every case.
(When I say &quot;repair&quot;, I mean to include such repairs as replacing with a good
used engine from a wrecking yard.)  Downtime will be much shorter as well.
In my case, the adapter flywheel from KEP (no relation) was $290 alone.
2.  I would strongly recommend staying with whatever cooling your van came
with.  That means Rabbit engines and Subarus for the waterpumpers, Porsche 6
for the aircooled.  The list of problems to be solved is long enough without
adding engine cooling (and heat/defrost for you) to the list.
3.  Guys at KEP are very knowledgeable (as are people at FAT and MSDS, who
have also provided parts for many swaps) but it is not fair to use them as freee
consultants by phone.  As another member posted, read the catalog, make your
plans, then make your call to order parts.
4.  Porsche engine is heavier than the VW 4, but not heavier than the VW 4 and
a pile of luggage.  My Vanagon's brakes and suspension are stock, with no
problems at all in reasonably conservative driving.
5.  I would also be interested to know how straightforward the G50 transmission
swap is, but I probably still couldn't afford it.  The stock Vanagon transmis-
sion has good news and bad news with the Porsche engine.  From the sound of it,
the six likes 4000 rpm on the highway a lot better than the VW did, and is in
a responsive part of the power band, but it clearly has enough power to pull
a 5th gear comfortably.  Vanagon gears are so low that you really don't feel
a BIG difference between 4 and 6 until 3rd gear.
G50 transmission would also mean using Porsche clutch parts.  With the adapter
flywheel I chose, I'm using relatively inexpensive stock VW clutch.  Also one
less thing to adapt.
6.  I have seen a Type 1 engine looking lost and lonely in a Type 4 engine bay,
but I wouldn't recommend it.  By the time you fabricate a rear engine hanger
and sheetmetal to seal the airflow and a muffler that actual reaches the end
of the car, you might as well have put your effort into the right engine.  But
it does work.
7.  None of these swaps are really bolt-ins.  The worst of them require mods
to the body of the Vanagon.  Even replacing diesel with Rabbit GTI requires
cutting the frame a little.  The Porsche six swap I did doesn't cut the frame
at all, but about 50 sq. ins. of sheet metal behind the pass. side rear wheel
need to come out so the oil tank can go in.

5b. regarding performance -- note that the swap I did is about the smallest
4 to 6 step possible: from the biggest aircooled VW four to the 2.2 911 T, the
most conservative of the Porsche sixes.

8.  In preparation for a future posting with more detail, the problem areas I
had to solve in my swap were:
flywheel
heater box connections
rear engine hanger
oil tank
additional height of engine
gauges
muffler
engine tin
accelerator cable
For a bigger hotter engine you might also need a front oil cooler.  Commercial
solutions are available for the flywheel (KEP or FAT) and rear engine hanger
and engine tin (MSDS), although the MSDS kit at $1700 is pretty pricey.  Every-
thing else, you have to solve yourself.  See why the original engine is the
cheaper way to go?

Post your questions, your plans, and other examples you've seen.  The more
fast Vanagons there are in the world, the better.

B.
