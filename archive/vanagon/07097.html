Subject: Happy Thanksgiving !!!!



Well,

It's getting to be that time of the year when we can shed our 
feelings of guilt and eat as much turkey as we can.

Soo,  Much as the bright part of the day was reading the listserver mail,
I'll have to sign off.  

The friends we are going to be visiting in a short moment do not understand;
they say it is rude to take my dinner and go eat it inside the Vanagon
with Pongo (3yr. old Lab) ... sigh..... Oh Well, I'll make sure I sneak
some out for him .... (the best thing would be if they'd let him in,
but they're allergic to dog hair :-(

For those readers in the US, have a happy Thanksgiving, everybody...


Cetin
