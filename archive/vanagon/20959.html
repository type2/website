&gt;   The only problem with sqirting water on any type of radiator is that it

&gt; it's a short excersize in physics but if you think about it it makes a 
&gt; lot of sense.  Hence squirting water on an oil cooler will kill your 
&gt; engine twice as fast, on the heads doubly so!.  The reason your engine 
&gt; stays cooler when it's rainy is that the humidity is very high and water 
&gt; vapor carries heat away from the fins faster than air.  If you can find a 
&gt; way to prevent evaporation from occuring on the fins when squirting the 
&gt; water it may actualy help but I doubt it can be done easily.

Whoa, wait a minute, something doesn't seem right here. When it's hot out, like 
it was this weekend in the Bay Area, your body (which is really just a big-ass 
radiator) sweats like a pig. When the water evaporates it uses some of the heat 
from your body to do so, thus cooling you off. I think the same concept would 
apply to a VW oil cooler. Please explain how a nice cool radiator makes the 
motor hotter.

I'd like to hear this short exercise in, errr, fizzix....I'm not convinced.
