Subject: 2.0  Inline Engine in a 87 Vanagon!

Listees,

  My ever searching job took me to a place that not many get to go.  I won't give up 
the location due to the fact that I was Sworn to not tell anybody were I saw what I 
was seeing :(

  I saw a 87 Vanagon with a 2.0 inline engine installed in it.  I work on VW's daily. 
 The shop I work for (Volks Cafe) has done a # of 1.8 gas engine conversions in 
Vanagons.  We try very hard to make the installs look as clean as possible.  The 
install of this 2.0 engine was a work of art!  A Air-box instead of early injection as 
we usually use.

  I only got to &quot;POKE&quot; at this Van for a couple of minutes, my reason for being at 
this peticular place was for a different reason.  I spoke to the master-mind behind 
the install.  The day prior to my visit the van was taken out for it's Maiden voyage! 
 The tech told me that it was hard to get it slowed down!  He said it totally 
overpowered the braking system .

  The main reason that this van was being built was to offer a &quot;Kit&quot; to do this 
conversion.  The kit would be ALL the parts to convert a Gas or those who have a 
Diesel, and allready have the Oil pan Engine mount etc would onmly need part of the 
kit.

  I will be informed as soon as the &quot;KITS&quot; are ready to be sold.  I WILL inform 
everyone on the list as soon as I get the word.

  I know how the 1.8 conversion feels to drive, I can't wait to feel this 2.0 
conversion.  I've gotten info on switching the gearing in the diesel trans to make it 
Taller for the gas engine conversion models.  With a trans like that in one of the 2.0 
vans, I can't even imagine what it would be like :)
