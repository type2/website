Subject: Replacing Stock 82 Van mirrors w/stronger model

I have an '82 Vanagon w/side mirrors that cant stay put in
winds over 70 mph (i.e. 10mph headwind while going 60...) If
I tighten the springs in the mirrors, I run the risk of ripping
the peg out of the molded plastic (done this once already...)

Is there a later year vanagon mirror that fits the same screw
hole pattern or an OEM replacement that isnt such a brain-
damaged design?

Any info appreciated!  Thanx!
