So Joel so-ugly-that-he-scares-a-freight-train-down-a-dirt-road Walker says:

&gt; awww, you are both so ugly ...
&gt; .. you have to sneak up on a faucet to get a drink of water!
&gt; .. your momma slaps your daddy every time she looks at you!
&gt; .. you need TWO paper bags on your heads (in case the first bag tears)!
&gt; .. even a possum won't eat your garbage!
&gt; .. you could knock the Teflon off a skillet!
&gt; .. your parents had to close all the curtains at night so the Moon could
&gt;       come out!
&gt; .. your parents wouldn't let you have a pet dog ... cause it kept trying
&gt;       to bury you!

Now Joel, your just still mad cause when you were born the doctor slapped your 
face instead of your bottom to get you to cry. ;p

;)

Early friday, eh?
