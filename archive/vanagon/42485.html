This gibes with the owner's manual, which talks about the light
switch, but doesn't mention any need for having the ignition on.
FWIW, there's a lot of useful information in there -- it might be
worth a re-read for those that aren't stripping and reassembling their
bus every day.

Which brings up the next problem, arranging a free spade to slip the
wire onto (once I extend it).  Any suggestions on how to add one to
the existing connectors?  There's probably some sort of Y-adaptor
already available that I don't know about....

Thanks.
