&gt; and said it may be a political thing to do with stainless steel exhaust not 
&gt; being the norm for mordern autos, can anyone come up with a more likely 
&gt; reason why this is so.
&gt; 
Political, economic more likely, if your stainless system lasts 10 years
but the stock mild steel goes in four or five, you got to buy
replacemnet parts from our favorite parts company VW at $1000 for the
system, why would you want stainless if you were them?

Incidently, as the heads on Wasserboxers are so close in configuration
to Bug heads why doesn't one of these damn Taiwanese knock off companies
start producing something to fit Vanagons?
