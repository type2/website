Subject: Breadloaf tents

If anyone else out there would like to go camping, have some extra 
room, and yet, drive away and then return to that extra room, ya gotta 
look at these tents on Joe's homepage.  It is a small German company 
in Dussedorf and I am in the process of getting some help in 
re-configuring a fax request and questions to them about these tents.  
Hope you think they are cool.
