Subject: Re: cb range?


Regarding CB antenna on top of bus-  With our 2, we can talk to each other
(with a hill between) over a max of about 2 miles. (portable in car, to our
mounted one in van).  The placement of antenna is important- best in
center, on METAL roof, which helps send the signal on a good horizontal
path).   MB in NJ
