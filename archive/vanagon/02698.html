/martha laments:

&gt;My god! What's the matter with this list today? No caffeine?
&gt;No songs?  No drivel?


Gaaawwwwdddd  &lt;sigh&gt;  Martha....make up your mind...you moan and
groan when we have too much caffeine...or make up songs about
you...then you moan and groan when we don't!

Well make up your mind woman!!!   8-)

Gee...an inspiration....John Sebastian's &quot;Make up your mind&quot;....

Did you ever have to make up your mind...

Say yes to one and leave the other behind....

Its not always fair, Its not always kind....

Did you ever have to make up your mind.....


Some times you have to put up with the songs on Fridays...
With all of the drivel and all of the caffeine......
Then one empty Friday comes right along...
No trip plans...not even a song....


Ok...someone take it!
