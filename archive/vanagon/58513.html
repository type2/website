&gt;Personally, I'm ready to forget VW and my next vehicle will be a Land Rover.

&gt;&gt;You really are a sucker for punishment.  Check out the Land Rover 
&gt;&gt;mailing list. They have more problems than we do!

I guess I'm a double sucker as I currently have both.  Yes both are spewing
various fluids all over the pavement.  My neighbors think we run an auto
repair shop on the side.  Even our usually reliable Honda has a bad
alternator right now.  Bad luck I guess.
