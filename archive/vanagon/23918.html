Subject: '71 acquisition story

Filled up the '76 Campmobile (a &quot;Westy&quot; is a small dog of some kind, 
isn't it?) at a 76 station (brand of gasoline out here) early this morning, 
the guy in the bulletproof glass booth asked if I was a VW kind of guy.
 
He explained he had been GIVEN a '71 T2 with 1,600 original miles on it, 
garaged since '73 when the original owner, his girlfriend's father, 
began having problems with his eyesight and could no longer drive.

Direct quote &quot;that thing burns like a Stradivarius!&quot;
