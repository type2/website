&gt; I was going to reply to you personally, but I thought that a public
&gt; post was better.  I wish you and your wife all the best in these trying
&gt; times, and I do hope that this new experimental treatment works.
&gt; I don't want to use that trite expression &quot;I know what you're going
&gt; through&quot;, but I think you'll find a lot of empathy in our
&gt; (not-so-)little group.
&gt; 

i have been replying in kind to messages. private replies to private 
messages, etc.

thanks for your response.

when i mentioned to violet that was getting so many replies with words of
support in them, she said that from my descriptions of conversations 
going on in the list it was not supriseing that &quot;those people&quot; would be 
of the friendly, supportive type.

she's right.

i know i'm repeating myself, but thanks, to you and everyone that sent us 
something.

&gt; About the van-list, I know I lurk more than I contribute, and even then
&gt; I don't always read every message (time!), but I always enjoy 'opening'
&gt; my mailbox first thing in the morning and looking forward to sharing that
&gt; feeling of camaraderie that exists in our group.  My only regret is
&gt; that I won't be able to take part in the Grand Tour of the West (TM)
&gt; coming up.

well, the way that seems to keep getting modified and expanded, it might 
soon include visits to all our areas.

maybe with either pontoons, wings, or cargo-passenger ships some of the
other continents could be included. sort of &quot;farferdneugen around the
world&quot;. 

maybe theres' something to look into VW sponsership for...

....maybe not.
