&gt; Lawrence,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks! Is this the recall number? VWoA told me that is was a technical
&gt; bulletin/upgrade reference, not a recall number.
&gt; 
&gt; Any opinions?
&gt;

Any opinions? Yes I have opinions but my spelling checker crashes when I
print them.

The reference I gave you
http://www.automatrix_dot_com/~skip/volkswagen/recalls.html refers to the
item as &quot;Volkswagen Recall Campaigns&quot;. 

WARNING - THE FOLLOWING IS A RANT -
The sticker on my door jam (what's still readable) looks like a recall
sticker. However you should not question the integrity if the VWoA
folks. There just trying to do the best job the know how to do. But I
think a laxative may help their disposition.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have yet to turn up definitive proof that VW actually recalled the
&gt; &gt; &gt; digifant ECU's.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I've confirmed that VW did revise the digifant several times throughout
&gt; &gt; &gt; each production year and that all Vanagon Digifant ECU's are
&gt; &gt; &gt; interchangeable. The difference being that each later model is
&gt; presumably
&gt; &gt; &gt; better.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; So, if anybody actually has a VW recall number, PLEASE POST IT!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I've searched the archives and found lots of info, lots of numbers, but
&gt; no
&gt; &gt; &gt; official VW recall number.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the time and help!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; tony
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; btw - I ended up buying a used ECU from a '90 for $200, haven't gotten
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the mail yet.
