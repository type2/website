Subject: so-34 interiors?

i just obtained a mostly complete so-34 interior (commonly referrred to as the 
&quot;flip&quot; seat camper)

i am missing a few pieces and was wondering if anyone out there had any 
components (easily identifiable by the white formica cabinetry) or any 
documentation. i would appreciate hearing back from anyone w/ info or so-34 
componets. as far as i know these interiors were offered from 61-64.

michael
