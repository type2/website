Subject: Re: Headlight oddity

Had same (?) problem in my 86. Problem was in ignition switch. The contacts
have limited current capacity (and there is no relay)  and prolonged running
on high beam caused plastic part to melt around contact. Replaced plastic
part at back of ignition lock for not much $.

Maybe that's your problem.
 
&gt;
&gt;The headlights on the V6anagon (sorry to cause offense, Jim) have been
&gt;acting a little strange: after being on for 1/2 hour or so during a
&gt;long night trip, they lose power. Later they come back on, and then go
&gt;off again, etc.
&gt;

&gt;Anybody had any experience with such behavior? Any advice would be welcome
&gt;before I roll up the sleeves and rip into it. I privately wonder if the
&gt;PO who installed the Chevy engine, might have wired a few things to the
&gt;nearest convenient switched-power source, which was maybe the headlights,
&gt;and now the circuit is taking out its anger on me.
