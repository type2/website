Subject: 'falia Sink Pump Questions

The pump for my sink has never worked since I purchased my
'falia.  So this past weekend I was on a mission from God to
remedy this situation.

First,after removing all the crap stored in the cabinet and taking
out the pump shelf cover I noticed that the pump connector for the
hose going to the sink was broken off.  So, #1 - I need to get a
new pump.  Any help here on prices and resellars?  I noticed that
the pump manufacturer is in North Hollywood (I'm in L.A.) does
anyone know if this place is still in business?  Do they sell to
the public?

Second, I didn't hear the pump work.  Should it work w/o  any
water in the tank?  I was testing for other problems such as the
16 amp fuse under the drivers seat which the manual mentions.  The
pump fuse is easy to check (it was fine) but I didn't want to remove
the drivers seat at this time since I need a pump first anyway.  But
this fuse, I assume, must be for other items e.g. the light above the
sink?  So if the this light works the fuse must be o.k.?

Last, there is a hole in the side of the cabinet, behind the drivers
seat where the wires from the battery come through.  There is also a
white coated 24awg wire coming through but doesn't connect to anything.
Any ideas what this is for.  Thanks.

-Scott.
