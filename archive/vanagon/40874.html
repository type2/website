Subject:       Re: aerodynamics (Seriously...)

&gt; I thought that the early Buses actually had a lower drag co-efficient than
&gt; the Beetle sedans. I read that somewhere.

I want to ask a stupid question.

What exactly does the drag co-efficient number mean?  I have figured 
that higher is worse, and I assume that .00 would be no friction...

But beyond that... 

Thanks oh ye guru's of air flow.
