Subject: Catalytic Converter Failure

I had somthing strange happen to me driving home from work the other day.  All
of the sudden my van lost power as though I was running out of gas.  The van
would not restart.  I checked every thing including:  fuel at the injectors,
spark, compression, cap and rotar.  All checked out fine.  I had heard a slight
&quot;rattle&quot; in the exhaust system during the week and decided to check the muffler
and catalytic converter.  I rapped the converter with a hammer and could hear
somthing moving inside.  Upon removal of the converter, I discovered that the
entire core had failed into many small pieces causing a blockage at one end.
After removing the converter, not an easy task after 8 years, the van started
with no problems.  Pricing new converters almost caused me to have heart
failure.  ie.  Local VW Dealer  $750.00!!!!!  but he assured me that the gaskets
were included.  That didn't help a whole lot, however.   I was able to locate a
after market converter for around $120.00.  Whew......
