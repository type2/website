Mark,

Yeah you have to remove the enigine to get it out, but if you spent like 10
years of work moving it around you might be able to prevent the removal, but
then you have to put it back on, probably impossible.  So save a ton of time
and drop the engine to do the work.  It makes removing the gen/alt and fan
housing a lot easier.

I have removed an alt out of a '65 type 2 but not the whole fan housing
while the bus is in there.  I had to take out the carb, fuel pump and lots
of little stuff.

&gt;Well I finally got the thermostat parts that the dread
&gt;PPO (aren't they usually worse than the PO?) removed from
&gt;my bus. (though I still need a return spring and some of those
&gt;little clips that hold the connecting rod on, anyone
&gt;have any of these?)
&gt;
&gt;My question is, can I remove the fan housing to install
&gt;these parts without removing the engine from my bus ('62),
&gt;or is it just too big a pain?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance,
