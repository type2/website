Subject: Syncro wheel bearings

I just thought I would mention that the seals for the Syncro are the same as
the factory originals.  The factory originals have a dust seal on the
outside surface.  The CR seals lack this dust seal.  The inner edge of the
CV joint housing has a dust seal that keeps things out of the inner side of
the wheel bearing.  The outer seal the only one that realy needs a dust
seal. The bearing itself is sealed,  seems VW wanted to ensure that nothing
gets into the bearing.  The fit of the CR seals is perfect.

If you can't dazzle them with brilliance,
baffle them with bull sh*t.
