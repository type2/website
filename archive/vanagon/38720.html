Subject: re: FREE VW Mechanics &quot;School&quot;

Dear All,
Ric offered to let anyone in the greater Boston area learn to do 
cool stuff 
on his '56 Beetle...this is exactly what I've been wishing for but I live in 
Seattle, and am afraid the airfare to Boston would nullify the &quot;free&quot; part.
Here's my question,  are there Puget Sound/Western Washington list members 
who would like intelligent, but mostly &quot;phase 1 (ala Muir)&quot; help on their bus 
or other VW projects.  I'm available and interested.  You can e-mail me 
privately or maybe other people are interested too and a general posting 
would be better. Thanks to any and all,
Jody
