Subject: wiper motor question
Date: Mon, 29 Jan 96 23:12:19 EST

Hey all,
	OK, one more question.  On this bus I am looking at, the wipers
	work well on low speed but when you move the switch to high
	speed, the speed of the wipers does not change.  Does this
	indicate a worn wiper motor?  Is there any way to fix it or is
	replacement the way to go?  Is there anything else that might
	cause this, like too much friction in the wiper arm joints or
	something like that?  Any ideas?

	Sean
