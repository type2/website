It doesn't need to take two people to purge the cooling system: a standard 
wooden pencil has the right taper and size to wedge between the throttle arm 
and body to hold the RPM anywhere you need it for this process.

I think the 1.9 pumps originally had studs and nuts holding the cross-pipe 
flange to the pump body; but the 2.1 uses socket-head capscrews. There's very 
little clearance to get an allen wrench into at least one of these (due to the 
way the pipe bends over it) - so you need an allen wrench with one very short 
arm. When my '87 first pump went out (104K miles) in nowhere-eastern Colorado 
some years back I just happened to have one in my tool box - don't know how or 
why, but I still keep it there.

The water pump in my '91 also failed at just over 100K - and checking it a few 
weeks before (as I had on the '87) showed no bearing signs or &quot;weepage&quot; - so 
I'd suggest changing at about that interval before you need to.

By the way - I had to buy an Italian pump locally when my '91 failed, even 
though I already had a &quot;German&quot; one on order for a planned engine rebuild. The 
next week I got the mail-order in a box with a small &quot;made in Germany&quot; label - 
but the pump is in all ways identical to the Italian pump - same casting 
markings, same small silver &quot;tested&quot; label on the pully flange, identical 
plastic bag markings, etc. I guess people want a box that says Germany on it.

I've also used a different Italian-made pump that would fit either a 1.9 or a 
2.1 by changing a fitting - seemed to work OK.

Kip - your highway problem may be a small leak between a cylinder &amp; head. 
Highway cruising can let enough gas come through into the coolant to cause 
those symptoms.  During rebuilding it takes a lot of care to keep from 
&quot;clipping&quot; the o-rings that seal the top of the cylinders to the head, which 
can cause this.

&gt; Dave, 
&gt; I have done the water pump on my 84 Vanagon and there were not any major
&gt; problems.   Before replacing the gaskets run a flat stone across the face
&gt; of the two surfaces to make sure they are flat.   There is one trick
&gt; though,  and that is filling up the cooling system afterwards.   It takes
&gt; two people - one to keep the rev's up and one to put in water and close
the
&gt; vent hole in the radiator.  Someone told me to jack up the front of the
van
&gt; at least 18&quot; (to help the air get to the vent).
&gt; While we are on the subject I have at times been driving on the freeway
and
&gt; had the needle peg and the light blink at me.   This happens without
&gt; warning (the needle goes from center to far right in a matter of
seconds). 
&gt;  If I pull to the side of the road and  wait for a minute, everything is
&gt; fine.  
&gt; Maybe my filling tactics are not totally correct.
&gt; Might there be air in the line?   Anyone had the same problem?
