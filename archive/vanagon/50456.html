Aren't those original speakers a great way to insult sound?

Anyway, I purchased a pair of 4&quot; Fisher 80 watts speakers for $40 (The   
Wiz) a pair.  They sound great!  I didn't have to do any cutting.

HOWEVER!

The trim around the speakers are bit too thick and therefore collide with   
the window crank.

Solution!
1-  I ended up replacing my window cranks because they were looking   
really hurt.  The plastic cover around the crank tends to glide around   
the trim of the speakers and rolling down the window is smooth.
2-  There is a way of installing the speakers under the door panels but I   
lost the bolts that would have allowed me tighten the screws
3-  With a knife, expand the hole so that the speaker trim does not come   
in contact with the window crank.

I also bought these Optima external mount speakers (40 watts, $20 at   
Radio Shack) to replace the ones I had hanging on the back and these   
sound great also.  I just need to get a real radio.

Hey Guys,

I've been reading about the tricks involed in replacing the speakers in
the front doors.  I know I'm gonna have to do this pretty soon, I still
have the original ones in there and they sound like crap.

Does anyone have a good replacement speaker in mind?  I really want to
use the same holes and grills.
