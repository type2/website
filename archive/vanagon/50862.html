&lt;&lt; Does anyone know of rental possibilities for a Westfalia in  Arizona or
Texas
 or California? We'd like to try it before we buy it (preferably a '90 or
91).
 Thanks for any help. &gt;&gt;

There's a firm that rents them in Phoenix, Salt Lake and, Seattle.  I think
their name is Adventurewerks (or ...works).  I'd do a WWW page search with
&quot;westfalia and rent&quot; and you should find their WWW page.  They've been
mentioned before on the list, so a list archive search should lead you to
them as well.

Good luck,
Jim Davis
