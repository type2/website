Subject: Sliding door handle - outside

&gt;From: &quot;Brian Isherwood&quot; &lt;bci_at_ROADRUNNER.CIRCON.COM&gt;
&gt;Subject: Sliding door handle - outside

&gt;The outside handle is loose and it wiggles quite a bit.  There is
&gt;some serious paint removal along a circular pattern in the door
&gt;handle recess - obviously from the handle scraping the body when it
&gt;is twisted to open the door.  Is there a rubber grommet or something
&gt;that rots out over time?  Or maybe am I missing a crucial part which
&gt;the PO was too cheap to replace?  I've always wondered, but haven't
&gt;lost much sleep over it....

&gt;Anyone?

&gt;Brian.

You are *not* alone.  My scrape/rust spot is only at the top
of the arc in the recess, but it is the same basic problem.
I have an 84 GL.  I have heard that VW changed things in 85
to improve the whole handle assembly workings, but I know of
no *fix* and have not (yet) lost sleep over it.

The 85 *fix* may have made the door open too easily.  Just
ask Tim Schlaile who has a door on his 87 that opens while
driving (even when locked).  THAT I might lose some sleep
over!
