Subject: black smoke when starting
Date: Wed, 11 Jan 1995 18:14:17 -0600 (CST)

The 75 Bus makes a big puff of black smoke (almost?) every time I start
it. The smoke dissipates after a few seconds and then things seem fine.
Could it be worn rings? Can I afford to ignore the problem?

TIA for your input!
