&gt;Before anyone gets visions of dueling Vanagons, pedals floored, being

&gt;landing lights and a live cellular video link to the Web, let me say that
&gt;I have too much respect for the work that goes into an engine conversion,
&gt;and for my driver's license, to play that game.

I don't wanna do all that... but it sure would be nice to be able to hold
75 on the highway on some of these long trips.  I just got back from a
1500-mile weekend drive to Busses by the Arch.  I spent most of my time
doing 60-65, which is just about all my bus is capable of at less than full
throttle, even with the 2.0 engine.  Every once in a while when a truck
roared by me at 75 I'd floor it, catch up to him and draft for a few miles
- sure feels good to go that speed when you've got hundreds of miles left
to drive, but as my oil temp begins to climb (and gas mileage begins to
fall) I always have to back it off to 60-65.

Now I know my bus is a high-top, but I still think it should be possible to
cruise in it at 75 while getting 20mpg.  I don't want no fancy Corrado
engine - just give me a nice 1.9 Turbodiesel!  :-)

&gt;I do have fantasies of entering an autocross sometime, just for the
&gt;&quot;dancing elephant&quot; fun of it.

And I've been wanting to take my bus to the dragstrip, just to see if my
0-60 time will be longer than my 1/4 mile time.  But I'm not gonna be the
only bus there.  Hey Dean, wanna race?
