Vanagon Models, 1991 - USA
Jim Davis 11/96


Seven models of the Vanagon were built for model year 1991.  
These were: the base Vanagon, Vanagon Syncro, Vanagon GL, Vanagon GL
Camper, Vanagon GL Camper Syncro, Vanagon Carat, and the Vanagon Multivan.

Colors available: Pastel White, Flash Silver Metallic, Orly Blue Metallic,
Bordeaux Red
Pearl Metallic and Tornado Red. Not all colors available on all models.

Distinguishing Features:
While year-to-year changes to Vanagons have been slight since 1986, there are
even fewer differences between the 1990 &amp; 1991 models than usual.  I don't
know of any specific differences than can distinguish a 1990 from a 1991
except the VIN and new paint color choices.  Some have said that VW didn't
sell any &quot;real&quot; 1991 models (that VW just sold &quot;carryover&quot; 1990s) in the USA,
but that is incorrect.  1991 models have VINs that indicate the 1991 model
year and VW printed a new 1991 Vanagon brochure.

The '91 continued to have black window trim like the '89 &amp; '90
models. The 1991 has additional carryover features from 1990 including:
2 Black plastic front grills (common to 1986-1991)
Rectangular primary headlights, separate square high beam lights
(common to 1986-1991)
Large VW logo in center of upper front grill
Large VW logo in center of rear hatch
Black plastic vents at the rear of the rear side windows

The 1991 GL, Carat &amp; Multivan Vanagons had metallic 
silver aero styled bumpers with matching rocker panels and body colored
outside rearview mirrors.  As in 1990, there was no 1991 GL Syncro model.
The Syncro choices were limited to the base Vanagon and the fully equiped
Vanagon GL Camper Syncro.

Prices shown below are MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price) figures 
from actual window stickers and other reference sources.  Where a range of
prices 
is shown, this depicts the range of MSRPs found. The price ranges are not an 
attempt to indicate a selling price range.  These varied prices are likely
the result of
mid-year price changes from VW.
