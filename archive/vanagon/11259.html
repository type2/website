Subject: Re: TRANSPORTER

&gt; 
&gt; HELLO, I FOUND YOUR ADDRESS THROUGH THE VNEWS.
&gt;    
&gt;    I SAW &quot;VANAGON&quot; AND FIGURED THAT I WOULD SAY HELLO.
&gt;    I'M WRITING FROM BALTIMORE MD. I HAVE A 1986 VW TRANSPORTER
&gt;    CREW CAB TRUCK FROM CANADA. IT'S GOT A MILLION MILES ON IT AND
&gt;    I AM TRYING TO PUT IT BACK TOGETHER. BASICALLY LOOKING FOR CONTACTS 
&gt;    AND INFO...
&gt;   
Hi Patrick, more than willing to help out, Email me a shopping list, the 
crew cabs are neat and rare even here. The deep discount on Canadian $$s may 
make real VW parts available to the masses once again. I can pickup here and 
then take stateside to Maine for US-Snail or UPS. tim s.
