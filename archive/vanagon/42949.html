Subject: Push rod tube &quot;bent wires&quot;

I got the motor out of the 81 yesterday and today pretty much reduced it to
the basics. Lots of cleaning up to do and I'm compiling a list of items that
need to be replaced. One of those items BTW, were the push rod tubes which I
hadn't thought about but were dented etc and I bought those at Nopi today.
They were &quot;discounted&quot; from $14 to $9.50 in honor of a slow Memorial weekend
which doesn't sound like much money until you multiply it by 8 and compare
that to the bug tubes at about $2 ea.---yikes!

Back to the point---When I removed the rockers, there were no &quot;bent wires&quot;
securing the tubes. I've never seen one in operation before and old bug
people say they aren't necessary but I suspect that's because they haven't
seen them either. The old tubes didn't leak beyound what seems normal. Do I
need these and if so where do I get them?

Thanks,

Weston
