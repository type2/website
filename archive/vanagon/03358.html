I was just going through the  gopher FAQs and found them very informative. if
you are interested in finding out where your Van  was made check out
the FAQ on VINs. Anyway I noticed that many of the later synchros and
diesels? were equipped with 5 speed transmissions. Would it be wise to
install one in a four speed system?
