Subject: Re: Thermostat/Too cool

David Carment was kind enough to discuss the possibility of air in the 
system and I was wondering why air in the system might cause the combined 
symptoms of 
   1. Temp gauge shows low
   2. Passenger compartment heating is inadequate
Specifically, I'm confused as to where the heat is going.  If the problem 
is air in the system, is the engine running hot and the area around the 
thermostat is cool so it stays closed?  Is the thermostat open?  If the 
thermostat was open, wouldn't the termperature be high?  The sensor and 
the thermostat are in the same housing.  I guess I'm concerned about 
where the heat is going.  Is the engine actually running hot?  Should I 
not drive it until this is solved?

Worried.
