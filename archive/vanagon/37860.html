Subject: Re: ?? Power for stereo in my '86 Vanagon

&gt;Anybody know why the headlights shut off when you shut off the engine, but
&gt;the parking lights don't??? This seems to me to be the height of silliness.
&gt;Obviously, the headlights shut off so you won't find a dead car when you
&gt;forget to shut them off yourself (don't you love it when car manufacturers
&gt;assume stupidity?). But the parking lights will run the battery down just
&gt;as completely-- they just take longer to do it.


i believe in some countries in europe, when parking on the street, parking
lights live up to their name.  people are legally required to put on their
parking lights when parking at night, so when you turn off your vanagon in
europe, everything is done for you!
