Subject: Re: Wanted: '67 cargo door handle, Help removing steering wheel

&gt;How does one remove a '67 steering wheel without breakage? Special tool? I
&gt;tried a gear puller, but I couldn't get it to &quot;hook&quot; on anything under the
&gt;wheel. It's pointed about 1:00 o'clock and if I'm even in an accident, I
&gt;expect serious rib injuries with it this way (less compliant).

Dribble a good amount of liquid wrench round the threads, then tuck the wire
into the column.  Put a spare nut on, and with your thighs pushing up on the
wheel, smack it good with a hammer right on the nut.  Repeat as necessary.
Always worked for me.
