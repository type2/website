RE:	Copy of: Front speaker replacement

I asked the same question about how to remove the cheap,sorry excuse for
Blaupunkt, speakers from the front door panels ( I've tried to unscrew them - no
dice- they just keep spinnin') to another listmember who said there was a
certain little &quot;secret pin&quot; or something you have to remove first to be able to
unscrew them. Unfortuneately he declined to elaborate on what that little
&quot;secret pin&quot; was.                 ( methinks to spite me?!? )   Anyway, at
present, is seems that the only other alternative is to (a): bust off the
plastic tabs on back, or (b): Pry 'em out from the front with a large
screwdriver and totally shred the hell out of the doorpanels (which is what the
PO of my '84 did on his quest to &quot;upgrade the sound system&quot;
( ie. JUMBO Sparkomatic speakers in the front doorpanels with foam rubber
cemented over the now gaping 8&quot; + or - diameter holes ) Looks real cool and
sounds even better. Oh yeah! gotta have that premium sound, ya know. 

What gives? Does anybody know how to unscrew them without screwing something up?
