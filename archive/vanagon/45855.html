Subject: Re: Nuts!...Axle Nuts!


Ok..Ok! Before you start throwing axle nuts at one another...

I thought that I had already posted this on Monday....however, there
is a possibility that in my moment of euphoria, I forgot to share the
good news.

After breaking both a 3/4&quot; and 1/2&quot; Flex-head over the weekend, I
tracked down a friend on Monday [Holiday here in Canada] and borrowed
a 3/4&quot; sliding crown style bar that came with a skidder that a
neighbour stores in his barn.  

I got home, heated the nut [which had been soaked with penetrating oil
the night before...again] one more time for good measure, put the bear
of a socket on it, attached the bar, added eight feet of pipe, opened
the driver's door and climbed up, then transferred my weight onto the
pipe [Ok..so I jumped].  The pipe made the most amazing arc and then a
rather load &quot;groink&quot; echoed throughout the neighbourhood and the &quot;Nut&quot;
did move.  After that it turned the rest of the way without a problem,
but was that axle rusty under that ol' nut.  The nut is still in
pretty hard shape...as I mentioned in my original post, it looks as
though it had been beat off/on the last time [so Clara, I may take you
up on that offer of a new Nut].

Of course, now I am faced with the dilemma of how to coax those brake
drums off...The &quot;beat the back of the tyre with a rubber mallet&quot; trick
that was successful with the front drums had zero effect on these
babies.  I am thinking about having a couple of pieces of curved flat
stock drilled so that I can bolt them onto the drum and hook a two
armed puller under them [I cannot locate a drum puller for the life of
me ....damn disk brakes..the local FLAPS no longer sells drum
pullers].

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Bricks...Oh, my!

Roy
