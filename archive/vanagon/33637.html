Subject: Re: Gas spill on filling Vanagon

&gt; 
&gt; Every time I fill the tank on my '84 westy about a half of a cup of gas 
&gt; pours down the side of the van when the gas pump automatically shuts 
&gt; off.  In Washington we have those vapor recovery type gas pumps.  Is 
&gt; there anything I can do about this overflow.

and still have it work. Complain to the attendant...the inside of those
hoses have wires that twist around the inner hose that are important
to the shutoff feature.

&gt; nozzle in the car and used the little lock to hold the pump on and then 
&gt; let go.  The pump popped right out of the car and stayed on, pouring 
&gt; a couple of gallons of gasoline in my eyes, on my face and clothes.  Be 

I have learned that this is caused by sticking the nozzle in too far.
Us vapor hose people are used to sticking it in there far to get it to
work. Real fun, eh.
