Subject: Re: Bus Sightings...




&gt; Morbidly enough, this might be a great chance to pick up a 
&gt; real piece of history at a police auction in the near future.
&gt;


on the mobid thread i have heard of a nice split that was obtained from the (ahem) late PO's wife...... It 
tuens out that the actual PO who OD'ed in the front seat, and that is why the bus was for sale. Now there is 
a pleasant thought...
