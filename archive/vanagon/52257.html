&gt; Hey everyone.  I hate mondays.

&gt; I had a clutch put in my 85 transporter at the dealer (world's WORST VW

Now, now Gary.  One dealer is not necessarily the world's worst VW dealer
- as far as I can tell, they're all horrible.  (Want to hear about my $1,200
fuel injection job to fix a $50 part?)

&gt;                              and I guess they didn't put a new pilot
&gt; bearing (supporting the input shaft for the trans.) in when they did so.
&gt; Anyway it disintegrated after a while and my shaft got kind of chewn a bit.
&gt; Anybody know how much play it can have in the bearing? I doubt any, but
&gt; what kind of work (and cost) is it to replace the shaft?
&gt; 
I don't know what play is allowed.  If the shaft really got &quot;chewed
up&quot;, then &quot;play&quot; is probably not the issue here.

Looking at Bentley's, it doesn't seem like too difficult a job to remove/
replace the main shaft: Drop trans, seperate clutch housing from trans
proper (6 bolts), remove a circlip, push reverse gear backwards and screw
out main shaft.  No special VW tools or anything!
