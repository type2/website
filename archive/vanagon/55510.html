Subject: Re: Hydaulic Clutch &quot;Adjustment&quot;

Chris-

I had this problem (sort of) last week.  It ended up being a leaky
slave cylinder - located on top of the transaxle.

My van wouldn't shift at all (thought it was new tranny time).

If you are *compelled* to tweak the master cylinder - try
dangling your feet out the front window...

The adjust nut is there, but you need a right-angled open end (13mm ? )
wrench to get to it; hopefully you have enough leverage.

Also check your brake fluid resevoir as this is where the clutch gets
its fluid.
