So James &quot;How-many-Type II-owners-does-it-take-to-screw-in-a-light-bulb?&quot; Brill says:
&gt; 
&gt; are cordless.  So, before I go burn the place to the ground:  Can 
&gt; somebody tell me how many 100 watt bulbs I can plug into this cord?  
&gt; It says &quot;Use this medium capacity outdoor cord with garden or power 
&gt; tools and appliances that require 10 amps or less.&quot;  It also says 16 
&gt; AWG on there and down by the little UL sign it says 10A 1250W 16/3 
&gt; SJTW-A.  It is 100ft in length.  I recently consolidated my household 

Hmmm.... let's see 1250 watt cord divided by 100 watts per bulb.... 

Hmmmm...  I get 12 bulbs with 50 watts to spare.  What'd you get?

;)  

I hope I didn't screw this up....   Am I forgetting something?
