Subject: 84 WB Misc Parts Needed (U)

     Drivers side engine &quot;belly pan&quot; piece (this is a three piece thing). 
     This tin piece screws (2) to large tin piece which goes across rear 
     (muffler shield) and also attaches to body frame with more screws. I 
     have the passenger side one. Need shield and screws.
     
     Muffler brackets (supports). From what I have seen, no one has all 
     these installed. Need one from catalytic flange to header stud (there 
     are three support rods on drivers side, two go to a stud mounted under 
     pipe just past oxygen sensor, don't need these) and the long one on 
     passenger side engine that connects to front bolt (toward front of 
     van) that holds pushrod shield in place.
     
     UPDATE: flashing cooling light was bad gauge. IF you overheat and keep 
     the needle pegged and light flashing for an extended time, the circuit 
     inside the gauge will fail. This was a week long process testing every 
     thing in circuit. Gas tank leak, failed emission hose assembly on top 
     of tank (thing with two plastic tees and long tube). More of the time 
     delay plastic I think.
     
     AVAILABLE: Instrument Cluster with all tabs intact. 83-84 model.
