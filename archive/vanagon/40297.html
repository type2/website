&gt;Anywho, while I was at a junkyard looking for some various parts I saw the
&gt;most unusual bus I have ever seen.  As we were walking ...
... &lt;long drug-induced hallucination deleted for the sake of sanity&gt; ...
&gt;Inside there was the Cinzano umbrella ...
&gt;... a brick wall ...  a wood burning stove ... a piano in it.
&gt; ...  I have no idea what it was doing in that junkyard.

now, i don't know about the rest of you folks, but i recognize the bus from
Ernist in Wonderland when i see it! ;)  and i'll bet that White Rabbit was
just around the corner, right?

&gt;Still astounded,

sounds like SOMEBODY dipped into the homebrew while it was still fermenting!

once ... when i was little ... and i got some bad moonshine from a cousin of
mine ... well, i seen a big ol' pink hippotamus tap-dancing on the hood of
a Buick. no, really.
