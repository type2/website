&gt; 
&gt; My 4 speed transaxle is doing OK, but the diesel Vanagon REALLY needs a 5
&gt; speed, and I'd love to have one.  My understanding is a 5 speed was an
&gt; option; however, I have never seen one.

..Steve Smith (at one time Steve and I were the Vanagon-list's defenders
               of the bunker burners.....)

...had one (with the 5-speed...) He has left the list due to a great 
job...but if I remember, he said that the lowest gear on the 
thing was real low, and he didn't use it...What I never could figure
out was if gear #5 had a higher ratio than #4 on a 4-speed...
