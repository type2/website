Subject: Neat Christmas Present Idea (tangental VW content)



I realize that there is only tangental VW content...that is this gift idea 
is German...and so are VWs..(boy that was a HUGE leap of logic)...

Anyway, this story goes back about 30 years or more. My grandmother bought a 
new radio, and wanted to get rid of her old one, which was a late 30s model 
upright radio with shortwave. So I got the radio, strung up a wire antenna 
and got into shortwave. The BBC....Deutche Welle...and Radio Moscow. It was 
interesting in the late 60s to hear the &quot;Soviet&quot; side of the Viet Nam war, 
and stuff going on in the US....

but I digress....

When I bought my '56 back 20 years ago, it was equipped with an AM/FM/LW &amp; 
Short Wave Blaupunkt radio. It's a neat accessory to have...at night with 
the shortwave on, and a little imagination, I can &quot;be&quot; driving through 
Europe in my '56.

With this in mind, my wife bought me a neat birthday present...a Grundig 
50th anniversary 960 table model AM/FM/SW desk top radio. Its neat...got a 
wooden case, big tuning knobs, gold cloth speaker cover..push 
buttons...typical of German 1950sroduct design, much the same as my '56..

So if you are looking for a neat christmas or whatever idea...try this.
