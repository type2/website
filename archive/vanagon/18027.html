Subject: Storage on top of van....

Someone inquired as to the nature of my rooftop storage.  My 76 (and most 
68-80 ???) have a psudeo-lugage rack on the roof above the driver and 
passenger seats.  Actually, it is a slight (about 3-4 inches) depression 
in the turtle shell.  Also, it is level, unlike the rest of the shell.

Last year, I went to Sears and bought a big box.  It was plastic, and 
made by rubbermaid, I think.  It was designed for boats, trucks, etc.
I drilled 4 holes in its bottom, and 4 holes in my psudeo-luggage rack, 
and presto - instant storage.

But as I brought up earlier - this is apparently a problem.  Tacking a 2 
foot high extension to the already flat fave of a VW van just makes 
things bad - like intake for the engine.  So this weekend I think I will 
build a wooden box.  I plan on shaping it like a trapezoid, maybe 4 
inches high in front and 8 in the back.

Anybody have any advice on wood boxes on top of vans?
