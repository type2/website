&gt;According to Muir, my type I 1966 engine (the ID # starts with an F) should be 
&gt;timed to 7.5 degrees BTDC. The problem is, in the table that shows where each 
&gt;year is to be timed, it shows mine as having three timing marks (TDC, 7.5BTDC, 
&gt;10BTDC) but my pulley only has two marks. What do these stand for? TDC and 
&gt;7.5BTDC? Which one should I time to?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

You might want to consider buying one of the degree pulleys.  They're about $15
and easy to install, and make it simple to see where your timing is set and to
check your advance.  I'd recommend the original size instead fo the &quot;power
pulley&quot;, which will not only require a different size belt but as an added
&quot;benefit&quot; will also underdrive your fan.  :-)
