Subject:       Great Plate [f] 

Even though it doesn't apply directly to Vanagons/Busses.

All you physicists should appreciate this:

I saw the greatest license plate on a VW Quantum this morning.  It 
simply said, &quot;Theory&quot;

At first I was perplexed.  Then when it clicked in that it was a 
Quantum...  &quot;Quantum Theory.&quot;

I was indeed impressed that the owner had made use of his vehicles 
name to come up with something creative!
