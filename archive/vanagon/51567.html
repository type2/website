I purchased a kit from NAPA to test for exhaust gases in the coolant. It was about $30 but can be re-used many times. This was after I got tired
of taking the bus to the local garage . He (the mechanic) would use his
exhaust analyzer to &quot;sniff&quot; the coolant expansion tank for HC(always for
free). The presences of hydro-carbons the would mean a &quot;head seal&quot; leak.
As it turned out my symptoms, which were almost identical to yours, were
caused by a radiator in need of cleaning out.
Good Luck

&gt;What's the chances of the heads just needing re-torquing? Is this

&gt;experience with 
&gt;thems stopping VW Camper head-gasket leaks? If so which type? I've 
&gt;seen metallic aluminum 
&gt;(dry) types, liquid types, etc. Since the type of anti-freeze you use 
&gt;is so important to 
&gt;these aluminum head engines, I'd think the wrong type of stop-leak 
&gt;could also damage the 
&gt;heads?
