Subject: Shift rod accessory

Hi folks,

A friend of mine who was getting rid of his old bus stuff (he busses no 
more) gave me a neat shift rod attachment that works great for me and maybe 
some of you would like to use something similar.  It's a chromed shift rod 
extender that you screw on the end of your shift rod.  It extends the rod 
by two inches and then angles 45 degrees and extends another two inches.  
The stock knob screws on the end.  It makes the shifter much more 
accessible although by now I think my right arm must be at least 10mm 
longer from shifting without it for so long.

He told me he bought it many years ago from an aftermarket VW place.  It 
doesn't have a part number on it but maybe some of you know where these are 
still available.  I often wondered what those Berg shifters would be like 
but I could never justify paying $140 for a shifter.  This little gadget 
does just what I want.

BTW, when I bought my 70 bus the PO had a large plastic Budweiser beer tap 
handle attached to the end of the shifter which looked real awkward to 
grasp.  He warned me (seriously) when I took the bus out for a test drive 
that that was not included...darn..
