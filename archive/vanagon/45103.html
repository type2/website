Subject:  Available Tickets FurtherFestival/Nissan Pavilion/ Camping 

	         site $13 or $20

     I apologize for the non VW content but for those who are interested
tickets are still available for the June 26 concert at Nissan Pavillion.  I
personally have 4 extra pavilion tickets I will unload at price $39 each to
anyone who is interested. That is what I paid for them after parking fees
and ticket master charges.
   Additionally, there is a campsite two minutes from the pavilion down
Rte. 29. You can get tent spots for $13 and spots with electrical hookups
for $20. With the camping fees you have access to showers and a pool. 
I plan to take off Thursday and enjoy a day in the pool.
    I don't know about you all but I am extremely anxious to see a huge
gathering of busses along with the opportunity to boogie to the sounds
of the Further Festival!!!!
