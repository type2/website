&gt; Hey all,
&gt; I really really hope this is a joke :)
&gt; 
&gt; Taco Bell has taken out a full page ad in today's Washington Post with
&gt; the following text:
&gt; 
&gt; At the top of the ad there is a big picture of the Liberty Bell.
&gt; 
&gt; Below that it says:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;TACO BELL BUYS THE LIBERTY BELL
&gt; 
&gt; In an effort to help the national debt, Taco Bell is pleased to announce
&gt; that we have agreed to purchase the Liberty Bell, one of our country's
&gt; most historic treasures.
&gt; 
&gt; It will now be called the `Taco Liberty Bell' and will still be
&gt; accessible to the American public for viewing.
&gt; 
&gt; While some may find this controversial, we hope our move will prompt
&gt; other corporations to take similar action to do their part to reduce the
&gt; country's debt.&quot;

&gt; 
&gt; 	Now that's a practical joke.

&gt; 
&gt; 	P.S.  I swear to God I'm not making any of this up.  Look in the
&gt; 	A section of the Washington Post, 4/1/96.

I heard about this on a news blip.  Taco Bell got jammed with angry
phone calls and e-mail.  It is an April Fools Day joke.  I heard even
the parks dept. is miffed.  They did it to kick off a new add
campaign.  
On the plus side.  Taco Bell donated $50K for upkeap of the Liberty
Bell and monument. 
All according to what I heard on the news.
