&gt;In contrast, the slick unit in the 
&gt;'90 Wolfsburg works great - its relatively quiet, and manages to 
&gt;cool the cavernous interior with no problem, even on those dasterdly 
&gt;days when I have to drive the freeways to Los Angeles, and its 95F, 
&gt;smoggy and stop and go for ever. I guess the German engineers 
&gt;finally took it seriously.

This reminds me of a story about the development of the air conditioning in
the mid '80s Audi 5000.  Whether it's true or not, I can't confirm.  It
seemed that those developing it were satisfied with the A/C (probably worked
fine with the weather in Germany), but those higher up were not.  It seems
that they finally realized the importance of A/C in she wouthwest US.  It is
said that the engineers were sent to Arizona with a black 5000 with a black
leather interior.  Needless to say, the A/C was promptly redesigned...
