Subject: Re: Heat while camping??

    The Surbuban Furnace stock number is NT12s, this is a 12,000 btu 
heater mane for small popups and campers and has a front discharge 
grill ( i modified this to vent to two four inch ducts, one is moveable 
and ducting is dryer hose.
    In the EV I mounted it behind the driver seat where the little 
fridge went. I had to cut a 9&quot; x9&quot; hole in the seat which it mounts 
under and also through the inside wall, there are two 2 3/4/&quot; holes 
through the vehicle sheet metal.
    I installed it all by myself (look ma no hands).  This installation 
required only a special sheetmetal hole saw and a sick willingness to 
cut holes in your EuroVan; check, recheck, check again, repeat 
infinitum.
    The current draw is a dream, 2.3 amps, it will run for days on my 
deep cycle.
    I also installed a propane tank under the van, THIS IS HELL.  
Requires massive interior dissasembly, if you own an older VW bus and 
do your own repair work this is right up your alley.
    This installation (furnace) seems to me that it would be easier on 
almost any van other than the short wheelbase EV, the room is very 
constricted, the main concern is access to the wall of the bus for the 
exhaust &amp; intake.
    If Ive forgot any thing just ask.  I will be out of town, I'm 
leaving at 5:30 PM PST.

&gt;Could you post some more details on this?  Which model heater is it?  
&gt;Where did it get mounted?  Did you or another facility install it?  
&gt;Current draw when running?
&gt;
&gt;thanks!
