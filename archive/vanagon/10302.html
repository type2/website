Subject: Question

Gerry, I have computer question that I would like to put to the group.
My boss has told me that I will tell her everything I need to get a 
hookup to the WWW she will see about getting the money.  I know I will
need some software and some more hardware but other than that I am at 
a loss.  I know there are many people on Vanagon that have this stuff 
and so I would like to ask a few of them what they are using.  I could
go to a newsgroup or something but I think I would get the quickest, 
most precise and helpful info from the fine folks on the list.  So, if
I put in a subject header that says [off topic computer question] or 
some such thing could I give it a go?  Thanks, Jim
