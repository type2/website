Subject: Re: Isn't that 5', 33&quot;?

&gt;For me, the sound of my family's 68 Bus being downshifted is as much
&gt;the music of childhood as James Brown or Vaughn-Williams.

I second that reply! What's all this talk of &quot;music&quot; when you have an
air-cooled symphony of slappy cylinders, valve chatter, and exhaust leaks
at your beakon call? (Well, some of us still have exhaust leaks.)

I'm just wondering where I can get a recording of a perfectly tuned 1600
dual-port (as heard from the driver's seat) so I can compare tonal styles
to my own bus. I could turn on the stereo; turn over the engine--dualing
dual-ports! Maybe someone could put a sound byte on the web somewhere. I'll
be happy to record mine for an on-line diagnosis 8-).

Is it Friday yet?
