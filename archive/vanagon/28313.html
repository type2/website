My understanding is that the gross  causes are thus - 
o  Ignition timing off
o  Valve timing off
o  hot cylinder deposits igniting the mixture instead of the spark plug.
       ---------------------------------------------------------
Don't forget exhaust leaks! Remember, on the VW engines, there is some valve 
&quot;overlap&quot; with even the stock cam. (Overlap refers to a period where both valves 
are open.) Unburned fuel/air mixture is used to help force the spent gasses out 
to the exhaust. Allow some fresh air to enter this mixture...and under the right 
conditions (such as de-accelerating) you get BANG! Definitely not good for the 
EGR valve, if so equipped! On the type-I engines, the culprit is usually the 
joint between the heat exchanger and the muffler. Those little do-nuts sometimes 
don't seal properly, especially with aftermarket headers and the like.
