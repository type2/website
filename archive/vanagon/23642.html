&gt;Would like some suggestions on ways and means to get the van (the &quot;Villa&quot;)
&gt;level when camping, without too much fuss and jigs.

best thing to do is to go look at the RV places and see what they do ...
that will give you some ideas. their stuff is way too expensive, but you
should be able to figure out which methods you do or don't like.
