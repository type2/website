Subject: Re:  Gasoline difference

&gt;...About 5 years ago I shifted
&gt;to BP beacuse there was a BP station in my neighborhood and cheaper.
   Is cheaper really better or worse? Then, you found out...

&gt;...Is it true that there is a difference in different brand of
&gt;gas? I never believed this before. Now I am wondering.
   Of course.
