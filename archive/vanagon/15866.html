Subject: Original Owner '71 SuperBeetle for sale

For the first time in 24 years, my superbeetle is for sale...  Sadly, I no 
longer have the time nor money to put the motor back together and in order to 
keep peace in my household I have to part with my trusted friend.  

He is a 1971 Superbeetle, Clementine (Orange), with 2 extra sets of wheels 
(empi 8 spokers and wide custom chrome wheels), GoFar Gas tank, Cibie 45 Pencil 
Beams, original Kamei air dam (first on in the SF bay area circa 1974), Trick 
trans w/ 4.125 ring &amp; Pinion and a bus 4th gear (.82:1), 2110 cc motor (apart &amp; 
needs assembly), airhorns, tissue box, etc, etc, etc....   I'm looking for a 
good home for this fellow (and hopefully first right of refusal) where he will 
be restored to his original street condition.  

This is an ORIGINAL OWNER CAR from Northern California...  I personally rolled 
this car off of the showroom floor on 14 August, 1971 at Wes Behel VW in 
Sunnyvale...   US$1095.00 or best offer....  home #, 415-965-2599, work #, 
408-562-5578

       Jon
