Subject: Help make this bus run!

Well, my motor is back in, but I can't get it to run well.  I set the timing 
at notch, I think 7 degrees after TDC, and here the engine had a hard time 
starting, and seems to be running hot.  The brand new extractor system 
already has all it's paint burned off.  I'm coming from a real disadvantage 
in not knowing what the thing is supposed to sound like or how hot is hot.  
The smell of burned brazilian paint doesn't help either.  I think the carb 
is screwing up as well, this afternoon I took it apart and put a kit into 
it.  I don't think that helped at all.  It will not idle very well at all, 
and has a hard time starting when it's warm.  I know what pinging sounds 
like, and it's not pinging.  I had a hunch that the timing was too late, so 
I set the timing to 1 degree ATDC.  Here, the engine starts real easy, but I 
couldn't get any power out of it.  So, please give any advice you can.  I am 
seriously thinking about going to a different carb which is much simpler.

BTW I have :
1) 1600 dp with a 009 and 34-pict-3 carb.  The crank pulley has a TDC mark, 
so I can time it anywhere I want.
