Subject:      buses for sale: 71 p/u, 81 camper

in local birmingham, al sunday news:

VW Vanagon '81 Westfalia. Good cond. Newly rebuilt eng. $3850.
    call 328-3823.


in this week's Auto Trader:
1971 Volkswagen P/U &lt;single-cab&gt;, rebuilt eng., etc., needs brake work,
   some rust on rockers, drives good. $1550.
   (205) 855-9029.

yeah, i called about this one. :(  he said he'd take a &quot;couple of hundred
less&quot; than that price. no hubcaps. engine runs good, non-vw carb (2-bbl).
brake problem is leaking fluid somewhere ... doesn't know where ... keeps
having to add fluid every couple of weeks or so.  it's located in Phenix
City, Alabama (yes, that's how they spell it!) which is right on the AL-GA
border (across from Columbus, GA) ... about 4 hours from me, or about 2
hours from atlanta. interior is in 'good' shape, yaddda-yadda-yadda ...
same old stuff. he said the rust problem was the piece under the storage
compartment, but that one of the hinges on the storage door is rusted a
little and is kinda hanging.

yeah. i'm thinking about it. :) then i would have a 68 double-cab, and a
71 single cab and an 88 vanagon. but what i really really want is all
vanagon pickups!!! :)  so... if anyone else wants the 71, go for it! all's
fair in love and buses. ;)   or if you want my 68 double, well ... it doesn't
cost anything to talk.

ye olde Bus-pimp,
joel
