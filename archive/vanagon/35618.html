Subject:  Crashworthiness of Bug Vans 

 &gt; One last comment.  I was sitting in the drivers seat and looked ahead.
&gt; There is not much between you and anything you might hit besides the
&gt; steering column!

&gt;Kind of looked like point of impact to me.  I used an aircraft harness to
&gt;make myself feel more secure and kept meaning to put one of those spare
&gt;tire mounts on the front thinking it would be kind of be like a bigger
&gt;bumper.  You are up a little bit at least.

&gt;Re: Attention Bus Volks: part ??

I've often wondered about crash worthiness of  my van.
I also wondered if 20 year old seat belts are any stronger than wet
lazagna noodles.

I've rationalized it this way:

1. I weigh more.
2. I'm higher, so won't hit any solid parts of little cars.
3. I've got a massive frame, bumper, etc.
Therefore I'll use up the other guys crumple zones, hence I don't
need any of my own.

Weighed against:

1. Seat belts are old, and could break.
2. If seatbelts don't break, I'm directly connected to the friggin' frame!
3. I start the whole process out about 6 inches from the accident instead
   of 4-5 feet that I would in my car.
4. No shock mmounted seat belts
5. No air bag.

Conclusion: Unless I hit a Miata, I'm toast! 

Anybody have other opinions, or data?
