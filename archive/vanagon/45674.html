Subject: Do dealers know how to work on EVs

Howdy.....

Does the average vw dealer know how to work on a EV camper?  Is the 5 cylinder 
engine one used in another one of their cars?  Is it reliable.

We are in the market for a used or new EV camper here in Toronto Canada.
Any ideas or info?

Thanks
Chris
