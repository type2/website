Subject: Re: NEW Eurovan MV/Weekender clarification


Tim,


The full-blown Westy EV is no longer sold in the US or Canada. The US only 
received the &quot;weekender&quot;, while Canada had the Full Westy package from 1992 
until late 1994. The Westy is still available everywhere else in the world 
tho...
