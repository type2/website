Subject:       4-sale in VT,91 Carat

Friend of mine is selling a 1991 Carat.  They just had a kid on 
Monday and need the cash. Asking price $13500  obo.  But 
they do need the cash, sooooo i guess it is OBO!!. Excellent shape 
with 59k on the odometer.  It has been off the road in the winter. 
Marune with a light grey interior.  This Carat has two rear facing 
seats, bed/bench seat, table.  I'm sure they will accept a decent 
offer. The Vanagon is located in Johnson, Vermont.
