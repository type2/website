Cognoscenti,
Today my temperature guage decided to quit. I've checked my Bentley but
can't find where on our '86 Syncro Westfalia the sender unit is located.

Would someone please help me?

Because I'm on the List in Digest mode, would you please reply directly
to me at ljohnson_at_halhinet.on_dot_ca

Larry
