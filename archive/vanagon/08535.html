&gt; 
&gt; The address is 191 Castro in Mountain View. Patrick, would be so kind
&gt; and give us all some direction from the closest HiWay off-ramp?
&gt; 
&gt; Not having heard from Patrick, I'll volunteer the following directions:

  Exit hiway 101 at Moffett Blvd. and head west. As Moffett crosses Central
  Expwy. and the train tracks the name will change to Castro. Stuft Pizza 
  will be on your left shortly thereafter. From 280, I think it would be 
  best to get off at El Monte, head east down to El Camino, turn right and
  go south to Castro, where you would turn left and find Stuft on your right
  4 or 5 blocks up. Hope this helps.

  See you there,

  Dave Kautz
