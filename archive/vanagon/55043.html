This removable camper conversions are available from Tischer, Germany,
or two other manufacturers, even for the EV.

I saw a killer olive drab military double cab with mounted guns and all.
The back was partially covered by a canvas tent.  It was on a series of
flatbed train cars that had a bunch of hummers on them in a foriegn
country.  I saw it while I was flipping through channels on a religious
commercial that said the end was coming.  I would love to put a removable
camper conversion on that van.  Have a good weekend.
