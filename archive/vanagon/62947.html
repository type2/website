Subject: All Vehicle Tent - Day late and Dollar short

     All-
     
     It's too late!  I just got off the phone with Johnson's customer 
     service.  They have had the Eureka AVT in their catalog since 1989; 
     until this January.
     
     All the speciality tents have been discontinued, including the AVT - 
     poor sales.
     
     They also couldn't hazard a guess as to whether any of their vendors 
     have any in stock (probably not, was the answer).
     
     I explained to the customer service rep how difficult/expensive it was 
     to find a suitable vehicle tent.  And that how whenever I called a 
     camping store to ask, I would get referred to an RV store and vice 
     versa.
     
     BTW, I think she said that the tent sold for about $250!
     
     Time for a letter-writing campaign?
