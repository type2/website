Subject: 76 westy leaks oil like a mother

Hello:

        Maggie has sprung a serious oil leak.  It seems to be coming from
around the oil cooler, but I can't tell, because the oil filter is in the
way.  But it's a huge leak, and I can see it pouring down the left side of
the oil pan there, down to the bottom, where it drips of at a rate of about
a drip per second (holy cow!).
        Any help as to:
        A.  How do isolate the leak
        B.  Where it might actually be coming from

The necessary info:
1976 westy, 2000 cc AFC.  Already tried tighetening the oil filter.

TIA,
Eric and a sick Maggie
