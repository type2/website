My twelve year old daughter was at a flea market
and bought me this as a gift:

Popular Mechanics, July, 1955 issue

Cover (illustration) is a two-toned (white over orange)
Kombi parked at a lake shore, side doors open, with the
headline &quot;Volkswagen Camp Car&quot;

The other cover headline is &quot;What can we do about smog?&quot;

Inside the two-page VW article begins:
        There are cars, and there are cars -- and then
        there's the Volkswagen.  As one enthusiast described
        it: &quot;The VW is not just a car, it's a disease.  And
        a very contagious one at that!&quot;

Other information is that the Kombi is $2095, the MicroBus
is $2195, and the DeLuxe with fold-back sunshine roof is $2745.

I must also say how it closes:
        What about spare parts?  Take along an extra fan
        belt -- that's all you need.  VW engines normally
        go 100,000 miles without an overhaul!
