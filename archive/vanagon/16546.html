Subject: crack in poptop

My poptop has a crack which is visible from both the underside and
the top of the poptop, and leaks slowly during rain or carwashes.  Has
anyone else had this problem.  Regardless, do you have suggestions
on the best method to fix it?  I assume it should be filled/repaired
by something with a lot of flexiability and give.  Silicone?  And then
what?  Painted?  Gel coat?
