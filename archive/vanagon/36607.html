Subject: Rather odd EV `road test'


I found a rather odd road test of the current Transporter (EV to most
of you). Odd, because it was in a motorcycle magazine. Deciding that
the British weather was a bit under par, the magazine lot decided to 
take the five bikes they were road testing to the south of France, but 
instead of riding them, they put three in a Ford Transit van and two
in the Transporter and drove them down. The mag has several pages
on the bikes (unsurprisingly) and a couple of paragraphs each on the 
Transit and the Transporter.

The Transporter was a panel van Syncro and had the following specs;

2.5 litre fuel injection, 5 cylinder, 4WD, rear diff lock, electric 
windows, central locking, five speed gearbox, rev counter, 
heated electric mirrors and ABS. Cost in the UK 20,122.00 pounds(!)

They screamed from Calais down to the South of France in (a claimed)
under 8 hours, which is pretty good going. They quoted the top
speed at 115mph (with three people, two largish bikes and other junk),
and reckoned on 16.4 mpg from a 100 mph cruising speed.


(I don't know if any of this is news to the EV crowd, but I'll
post it just in case)
