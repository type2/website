Subject: RE: Why is &quot;reply to&quot; the poster, not list?

An advantage to reading on UNIX with Pine.  I hit 'R' reply and 'Y' or 
'N' depending upon whether to also send to the list.  And the VW van 
content is... is....  dang sometimes this is hard....  

&gt; Ha... my mail program (MS Mail) does just the opposite. It always names
&gt; the list as the sender, so replies go directly to the list with no
&gt; intervention on my part... and I wish it named the individual poster
&gt; instead! I guess the grass is always greener...
