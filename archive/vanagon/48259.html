&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Well I think I found my oil leak, and I could really use some advice.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Symptom: 
&gt; &gt;After stopping engine, persistent oil drops would fall from near the
&gt; &gt;engine/clutch/transmission junction. Seemed to be worse after engine had
&gt; &gt;worked a while at full heat. No noticeable drop in engine oil.
&gt; 
&gt; so it's gear oil? Smells a bit different from engine, and thicker.

Haven't smelled it yet. The consistency is more like motor oil (lighter than
gear oil) but I'l do the smell check!

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Found:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Two small cracks in the clutch housing, directly behind the starter motor
&gt; &gt;mount. One crack is extremely small (and probably doesn't extend inside
the
&gt; &gt;housing). The other is a larger crack (I couldn't really see how big,
with
&gt; &gt;what appears to be a small chunk missing, right on the edge where the
&gt; &gt;housing and the engine meet. The crack is on the top/left of the housing 
&gt; 
&gt; This sounds wierd, between the engine and actual transmission is the bell
or
&gt; clutch housing that the starter is bolted onto.  Inside that is the
&gt; clutch/flywheel, and about 6&quot; of air, NO OIL.  On the trans end of bell
housing
&gt; there is a paper gasket keeping the oil inside the trans, so a chunk out
of the
&gt; bell housing by trans side could leak gear oil.

Its definetly the clutch housing thats cracked. Its a real small, non
fracture type crack (though possibly a sign of stress for sure). And it is
on the engine as opposed to the trans side of the housing (directly behind
the starter motor).

&gt; 
&gt; Do you have a Bentley (or any VW manual) to see the engine-trans assembly
&gt; layout and verify what component is cracked/leaking (your trans? =:O ).

Got it. Did it. Even have the T-shirt!! Seriously, that was the first thing
I did. The thing that confused me on the oil issue is the Bently's shows an
oil drain on the clutch housing.

&gt; 
&gt; The Syncro trans has a long black hard plastic vent tube that pokes into
the
&gt; engine compartment, about 1/4&quot; diam, mine ends under lid rim at right
upper
&gt; corner (nearest airmeter box)  I've heard of Syncro trans getting water in
,
&gt; then whipping it into a foam with the oil which all pushes out the vent
tube.
&gt; The extra water also makes the oil foam more anyhow, due to higher level
and
&gt; splashing.  Maybe drain and refill trans carefully, then watch for drips
again.
&gt;  This has worked for one member I read of.

Hmm. OK. I'll check that too (didn't see any tell tail signs of oil from any
vent tube, but you never know...

&gt; 
&gt; The JDWeld epoxy will seal up cracks in trans etc, is made for automotive
&gt; applications, so it may be a cheap fix, as long as it is not a structural
crack
&gt; that will keep growing, then you need to weld it.  Around the starter it
may be
&gt; structural, due to starter torque.  I would weld it rather than go parts
&gt; shopping, find a bigger machine/welding shop that does a lot of aluminium
&gt; welding.

Thats a great suggestion! Right now its such a small crack and since I
assumed that oil was in the clutch housing, if I fixed the crack I'd fix my
oil leak. I think the housing may be weldable (which will prevent a long and
expensive parts search). But I still have to figure out the leak problem!


&gt;   good luck, keep posting.   tim smith

With this vehicle, posting won't be a problem :) :)
