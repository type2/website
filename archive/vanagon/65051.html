&gt; &gt; driving out to visit my cousin in San Diego.
&gt; &gt; by that time, i will have completed my engine swappage experience.
&gt; &gt; (for those who don't know, i will be putting a chevy 2.8l v6 into my vanagon)
&gt;            2.8L Chevy.....
&gt;
&gt;         Warning!   About 2 years ago there was a guy named Steve Maher
&gt;         that had that setup. He found the hard way that the 2.8 has
&gt;         a dynamicly balanced crank/flywheel. Are you familier with
&gt;         this headack?!!!!

i talked to the KEP people and they said that they would send me a
balanced flywheel along with the engine kit.
