Idiot Factor...

So we decide to go to Death Valley.  Mid May.  Driving the '62 Panel 
with the 1600 single port.  Have a wonderful time.  Head toward Ridgecrest 
about 2:00 in the afternoon.  Climbing out of the valley, my SO comments, 
&quot;It smells hot.&quot;  I pull over. Check oil level.  It's right up there and 
it is HOT!  Sit at the side of the road for about half an hour.  Fire it 
up and continue.  Two miles and it's hot again.  Pull over and wait again.  
Repeat until about 5:30.  No clue what's going on.  Finally reach into fan.  
Pull out paper towel used at beginning of day to wipe dipstick.  Motor
never quite ran the same. (But it did get us home...)  

Moral:  Don't leave paper towels, shop rags, old newspapers etc. in the 
        engine compartment. That fan moves a LOT of air!!!
