Steve:  I told David S whatever he and the rest of you/them decide
is fine by me.  As I've not seen any of those sites, they are all
equal to me at this point.  If I can rig up the shower, I won't care
where I am  :)

At any rate, I think Schwarze is still out of town on work.  Can't
remember when he returns, but guess the issue will be taken up
at that point....
