Ken,
A guy named Dave Garth did this on his '86.  Pics are available at David
Schwarze's web site, um...http://www.anet-dfw_dot_com/~ddes/ I think.

If not, you can get there from my links page.

&gt; I can't believe no one has chimed in with their invention that takes
&gt; advantage of engine heat. I can imagine a tank with coils that transfer
&gt; the heat from anti-freeze. Come on guys..A couple of tees in the lines
&gt; going to the rear heater, some rubber hose, voila'!
&gt; Good Luck
