Subject: Rebuild or Sell??
Any suggestions or tales of past experience would be much
appreciated.

Seamus,   
          Assuming the noise is a -

        LIfter... Drive it. Change the oil and drive it.
                  Change the oil and drive it. Get it good and hot
                  everytime you drive it. Change the oil and 
                  drive it more. If after 300 miles of hot running... 

    Worse case, The lifters can come out with out splitting the
                case, witch means all you have to do is find a 
                replacement push rod tube, the kind for the old
                bug motors....I haven't seen such a thing for the
                2.1L engine, does anyone know of such a thing.
                Maybe for push rod tube replacement for bugs will
                work?
