David replied to Will's obvious ASCII of vanagons in a CB convoy:
&gt;I have no clue.  On the way to get a pizza 1 hour ago my friend and I saw
&gt;a late 70s westfalia pinned between a brick wall and a tree, across a
&gt;sidewalk, on it's side.  This not two blocks from my house.  On a residential
&gt;street!  The tow truck driver was just standing there looking bewildered.  :(

Rusty can't help but think:

Cool, parts bus!

(obvious hard hearted flame baiting response from liberal minded sensitive
people who'd rather have health happy people living normal lives versus a
parts bus that the neighbors would hate you even more for bringing it home
no matter what screaming price you stole it for and how many hundreds of
*marked up* dollars you could get at the next swap meet selling to
uneducated young kids just scraping their way toward completion of their
first car.)
