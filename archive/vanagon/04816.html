&gt;Hey Jack,
&gt;
&gt;I'm having trouble understanding this flat piece of sheet metal part.
&gt;I have the fabricated luggage rack.  Is yours different? 
&gt;
&gt;Steven

    Forgive me for not being specific on this item.  :)
In my '73 Westfalia, the pop-top is in the front and the luggage
rack is in the rear of the vehicle.  The luggage rack consists of
a fiberglass frame with ~1cm dia. steel tubes running lengthwise.
The sheet metal of the roof is exposed to the elements between the
tubes.  Luggage rests on the tubes, not the steel of the roof.

BTW, it was easier to route the antenna cable by establishing where the
magnetic antenna goes FIRST and then routing (or fishing) the cable 
through a window in the the pop-top tent and eventually up to the 
cab/dashboard area.

I've heard that you'll get better antenna performance if it is mounted
in the middle of a large flat metal area connected to ground like
a car's roof or trunk lid.

Obviously, your Vanagon has a slightly different config. that may
completely cover the sheet metal of the roof.   Sorry, Steven I'm not
that familiar with Vanagons, but I'm learning!  :)

I've got the digestified newsfeed, so this may be getting out a tad late.
Have a nice weekend,

Jack
