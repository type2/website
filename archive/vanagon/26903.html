I mostly stay in the middle lane on a three-lane freeway unless I'm 
entering or exiting.
I've never really cared if someone passes me on the right on a
three-lane freeway.  I assume that they are exiting or in their judgment 
the left lane was a bad choice.   As long as they don't tailgate before 
they pass I have no qualms whatsoever.  Tailgating, however, makes my 
blood boil.

Calm down, Ger......
