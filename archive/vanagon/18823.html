To All:

I understand there is some sort of a bus/van thing this Saturday.  I would
like to meet any of you who might be attending if I can solve the following
pair of puzzles:

A:  Where izit &amp; how to get there from here (Vista, California [find
Oceanside; hang a left])

B:  Once there, how do we recognize one another (aside from the chalky white
residue of burnt magnesium).

A specific time would be helpful.  And should I drive the bus?  (It ain't one
of those pretty ones; it works for a living.)

-Bob
