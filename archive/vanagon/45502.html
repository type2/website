Subject: '64 21-Window getting painted!


Just picked up my paint for the '64 21-window.  1 gallon Turquoise 
(L380) and 2 gallons Blue White (L289) of PPG Delstar Acrylic 
Enamel, along with reducer &amp; hardener to the tune of $400 and 
change.  I guess that's about the going rate for paint...

After putting this bus in the Georgia franchise of the Body Shop 
&gt;From Hell (tm RVB) last September with a promise it would be done 
by Christmas...

Anyway, all the body work (somewhat extensive) is finally done and 
it will be sprayed this weekend!  (Good Lord willin' an' the crick 
don't rise).

I need recommendations for the headliner and skylight window rubber.  
*Honest* and experienced recommendation on skylight window rubber - 
don't just chime in WCM - a friend of mine just put in their safari 
window rubber in and it wasn't even close.  I have used some of their 
other window rubber and sometimes I have been pleased and sometimes...

BTW - For those of you who have been looking for Sealing Wax Red paint 
and have been told that it is unavailable...  PPG now has it in their 
top of the line urethane paint (forget the actual product name).  
Still not available in acrylic enamel or lacquer though.

Maybe next week I can actually get started on re-assembly!

Dave
