Subject: Packard-Bell Technical Help


To All:

The people I'm staying with have a Packard Bell 'Legend' 300SX computer.  It
has only 1 mebabyte of memory.  They don't have any manuals for the machine
and would like to install America On-line software but don't have enough
memory.  I would like to repay them for allowing me to work on the bus in
their backyard by helping them with their computer problem but the three
local computer shops I called say they don't know anything about Packard
Bell... but would be happy to sell me a Pentium, etc, etc.

Can anyone help me out?  Seattle is just a boat-ride away; I think Seattle
has heard of Packard Bell  :-)

-Bob
