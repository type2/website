Subject: VW Club Newsletters

I'm the founder and newsletter editor of our local VW club.  I would like 
to exchange newsletters with other clubs (if this doesn't constitute a 
commercial venture) for story ideas, artwork, etc.  We're all probably 
publishing the same Bob Hoover Sermons, but reading anything other than 
my own writing is what I'm after.  Respond privately to the address below.  
Thanks and forgive the blown bandwidth.  :-)
