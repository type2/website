Subject: Bosch 009 Dist. on pancake.

Is anyone using a Bosch 009 distributer on a 1700cc pancake engine?  
I was told that the 009's were made for a different engine(Bug 
engine) and that they retard the spark to the #3 cylinder.  I was 
told that this is not needed for a bus engine because the #3 cylinder 
does not have an overheating problem like the bug.  I bought a 1974 
camper with a 1700cc engine(hardly ran) an it has an 009 distributer 
on it.  I am in the process of rebuilding the engine now.  The same 
guy who told me all this about the 009 said that to put it in a 
pancake engine the right way you have to cut the tins a little. Has 
anyone had to do this.  He also said he has seen alot of people that 
have it put in backwards so that the #1 plug is retarded. If anyone 
knows the right way to put a 009 on a pancake(assuming there is a 
right way), will you please Email me with the info.  Thanks alot.
