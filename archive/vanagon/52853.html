Last fall there was an '83 Vanagon in Bearoff's used parts yard in Bridgeport, 
PA.  It had a brand new set of snows on it, good quality too.  The guy gave 
'em to me for $40 for the set WITH the rims ( he didn't know they were new).  
Well I was at a Friend of mines garage and saw the stud gun sitting there and 
guess what I did.... You're not supposed to stud non-new tires as some are 
going to fall out but they all stayed in.  As for buying them new, I think 
plenty of tire places around here will sell you studded snows.  If you want I 
can try to find some new one for you and get some prices.

&gt;(Just want to mention it snowed about 3&quot;&quot; here in the mountains near Valley 
&gt;Forge, PA and my studded snows performed excellent!)

Hi, Bryan, I'm in Allentown - Where'd you get the 14&quot; studded snows???
