Subject: Tom's Party

Tom,  Great to see your party photos!  Great shots and we even loved 
to see your first bug.  Enjoyed seeing Larry's syncro also!

Thanks for taking the trouble to post the photos.  What color is your 
syncro?  I think ours is the same color but I don't know the color or 
color code.

Don (90 Syncro Westy &quot;Leana Hula&quot;)
