Insert teary-eyed tome here...
&gt; Speaking of finishing, as this spring marks the completion of my 
&gt; degree, I will no longer have access to the net, nor to the list.  I have 
&gt; a few more days of account time, but little free time between packing and 
&gt; studying...so...Adios!  VW amigos, it has been a wonderful slice of life 
&gt; to read and learn and kibitz with you all!  Peace...love...and my your 
&gt; bodies never rust and your motors live forever!

Well, ya know Chris, if you really loved us you could get AOL (D'oh!). It's not 
free, but my mother-in-law loves it.
