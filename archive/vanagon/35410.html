Subject:  CD-ROM parts

** Reply Requested When Convenient **

I just read a post concerning having to buy more than one CD-ROM for
each car you have.  Well, that could get expensive if you have a few
automobiles.  So, someone should sell these things and make them
customizable.  Say you have a '78 bus, an '89 4Runner and a '95 Neon. 
Instead of buying three separate CD-ROMS, one with all VWs ever made,
one with all Toyotas ever made and one with all Dodges ever made, just
get one CD-ROM with only the information that you need for the models
you have.
