Hey everybodies!

I must say...I'm glad to be back in the land of the virtually-living!  I've been 
sanding, bondo-ing, painting the interior and doorjambs and the upper roof under 
the pop-top in preparation for a trip to Miracle.  Well, Edward (time for a 
name-change?)our '81 Westphalia AIRCOOLED Vanagon is there now, and I have some 
time!  I feel a loss of energy from the void of having a huge project 
finished...almost....for now..take a look inside your VW's, volks....picture 
yourself masking it all off, or taking it apart, out, etc....bleah!  Yet, for 
all its frustrating stuff, it was a labor of love...when we see him again, he 
will be &quot;Brilliant Teal Metallic&quot; NOT &quot;Vomitous Yellow&quot;!!

WARNING!  I found scads of rust lurking in places that I thought were sound....I 
was amazed to find that the bottom of the sliding door was totally rusted 
out....that's when I learned how to use Bondo!  Many nooks and crannies were 
flakey, and some of the &quot;pinholes&quot; that looked like simple spots of exterior 
rust had actually spread way under the paint without rippling the paint.  Under 
the window rubber, also, is really scary!  Check your busses (Watch the 
skies)....I've had a '62 Deluxe on loan that was a total rustbucket..poor 
Gus(met his end when a dumptruck lost brakes)....our present one is from 
1981.....I shiver at the thought of all those poor VW's that are older than 
that, and haven't been de-cancered.....and here I am looking at a cute little 
'66 bug with fine surface rust over much of the roof and FENDERS!

BTW, does anyone know of a good supplier for window/door/poptop rubber seals?  I 
don't think I can get anything good from Whipme, and have {HINT} not yet 
received a Busboys catalog, or word of how to get one....really, now!

Take care friends, and know ye that I, too, wave!  :}
