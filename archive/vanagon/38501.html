Subject: RE: EV &quot;birth certificate&quot;...


&gt;Interestingly enough VW thinks of its vehicles as &quot;beings&quot;. The sticker 
with
&gt;the construction info and VIN number is actually called a &quot;birth
&gt;certificate&quot;,

So VWs have finally risen in status to the level of... The Pet Rock???   :-\


&gt;and down the assembly line when the engine/drivetrain are
&gt;mated to the body that action is called the &quot;marriage&quot;.

This has long been the customary term for this joining, in both U.S.
and overseas car factories. Workers on the assembly line are known
to refer to it in another way.
