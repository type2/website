So Lawrence Stivers says:
&gt; I must interject to the list snobs here.  I have been wanting to lower my
&gt; '85 Westy Wolfsburg.  Before the snobs delete...The reason for this
&gt; desire is that my Vanagon rides 2-3 inches higher in the front than in the
&gt; back.  I know I am not the only one with this situation.  For the
&gt; snobs/purists, I believe that my Westy would ride better, and maybe even
&gt; look like an 80-83 or a 86-90 Vanagon. Why would that be so horible?
&gt; I am ready....Flame away  8-)

Since you took it upon yourself to call those of us who are disgusted
with lowering VWs and other such adolecent nonsense as snobs, does
that mean I can refer to you and others that do these silly things 
as 'dorks' or 'geeks'?  :)
