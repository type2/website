Subject: RE: Tires &amp; Pressure '85 Westy 

Tire pressure should be set to the pressure on the door jamb, do not
however exceed the maximum pressure for the tire. This is where the load
range comes in. Generally the 35 PSI max tire is a load range B tire, your
standard passenger car tire. The vanagon calls for a load range C tire, you
basic truck tire. I am currently using a set of Continentals that are B
rated and I just run them at the door jamb pressure or max pressure,
whichever is lowest. I have not had any problems with them. HTH

&gt;Wendy,
&gt;
&gt;Are there any load rating markings on tires?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;From the 35 psi max pressure, I would guess that these are standard load
tire.  Just wanted 
&gt;to make sure.

&gt;&gt;My '85 Westy has tires put on by PO.  They are BF Goodrich P185/75R 14 
&gt;&gt;89S M&amp;S.  I notice the max tire pressure on the tires say 35 psi.  I have 
&gt;&gt;noticed in the camper owners manual it has one pressure, in the Bentley 
&gt;&gt;another and some people on the list recommend still another.  Can anyone 
&gt;&gt;recommend what I should be using.  The camper is always RTR (ready to 
&gt;&gt;roll) except for food.  We don't carry too many extras and just 2 adults. 
&gt;&gt;I have a feeling that we are running on marshmallows.  The local &quot;tire 
&gt;&gt;store&quot; told us to put 33 psi in each.  Your expert advice appreciated as 
&gt;&gt;usual.
