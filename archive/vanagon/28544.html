&gt; An easy trap to fall into, Dave. As I recall, there have been lotsa
&gt; tanker spills over the years. I don't recall all the companies involved,
&gt; besides Exxon at Pr. William Sound of course. But I'd be surprised if
&gt; Exxon was the only one that ever spilled oil and messed up a shoreline.
&gt; Wasn't there once a big spill (more than one?) off the Santa Barbara
&gt; coast, involving a tanker, an oil platform, or a combination of the two?

Fear not, fellow listmembers, I am taking this one to e-mail at this
point.  But, before I do...

:P  Steve, I'm right and you're wrong!  Nyah Nyah!
