So Dan getting-twisted-and-bent Houg says:
&gt; STOP!!!
&gt; MIS-COMMUNICATION (...What we have here is a failure to communicate)
&gt; 
&gt; Don't bend the arm 'up and down' in a manner that would add or 
&gt; relieve pressure on the glass.  Hook the cresent wrench on the flat 
&gt; part of the arm and ROTATE the arm so that the blade angle changes 
&gt; along the longitudinal axis of the wiper.  I guess this would more 
&gt; correctly be called a 'twist' rather than a 'bend.'  It will make sense when 
&gt; you go out to do it.  Hint:  place the wrench as close to the blade 
&gt; end of the wiper arm as possible so as to give the maximum amount of 
&gt; arm length for the twisting to occur.  
&gt; 
&gt; Let me know if this still seems futz'd up.  I hate trying to describe 
&gt; things verbally-- if you could just see my hands....
&gt; 
&gt; 

So your twisting my arm eh? ;)  I don't see how this will help.  when
I get a new blade it starts out perpendicular to the surface and gradually
becomes biased one way.  Then you want me to twist the arm so it's perpen-
dicular again and then when I get a new blade twist it back?

Dazed and confused,

Steven
