Subject: (Campers) Tipping the propane fillers...
Date: Fri, 30 May 1997 17:30:34 GMT

They don't have to sell me a couple of gallons, they can just say &quot;your
tank's too small and we're too busy in the store&quot; and some of them do say
that.  Other places will attend to me immediately without a minimum
charge even if I tell them that my tank's not completely empty.

The filler usually has to lie on the ground to connect and disconnect the
nozzle to the auto-stop valve, and sometimes it isn't as easy as it
should be, but the propane goes in OK and doesn't leak back out, and for
$3 and change I'm all set for another month of cooking and refrigerating.

I'm not a big tipper generally, but I can't think of a better situation
to tip someone than this.  They don't expect a tip so it's sometimes
worth a buck or two just to see the surprised look on their faces.
