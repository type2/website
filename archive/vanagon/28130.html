&gt;Hey VW people,

&gt;I was wondering if anyone out there has ever delt with the parts company 
&gt;known as MOFOCO. I am looking for a rebuild kit for my 1974 Westy and 
&gt;this is the only company I could find that sells a complete kit for an 

  I'm sure there are others --- and MOFOCO is a little high, but not too
bad. OTOH, I live nearby, and used to stop in there for parts -- not 
anymore if I can help it. Their parts are okay, but they seem to try
to gip you by charging you more than the catalog price. I've called them
on it three times now, and the last time I went in, nobody seemed to 
want to wait on me. I had to actually ask, after waiting there with
the Weber manual I wanted in hand, and watching them wait on two 
other people who came up to the counter after me, if I could pay 
for it.
   I mean, there was a significant difference in the
catalog price and what they were charging me. So in addition to their 
already higher catalog price, they were really trying to gouge me. I'm
sure if you made an order using a credit card, you'd get the same
treatment. So -- if you order, send a check or money order. I've never
gotten this sort of a deal from other parts places -- in fact, my
FLAPS seems to always quote me one price over the phone, then charge
less when I actually get there to buy it. But they don't have all 
the goodies that a VW specialty house does either.

All is impermanent -- and this too shall pass away.
