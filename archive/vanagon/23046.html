&gt;Amen. Take the coda! Time to fill the ice chest, toss the surfboards
&gt;in the back, and bus on down to the beach.

I had just returned from the States to Germany, when a friend's snobbish
aunt wanted to know how Americans managed to survive in a country without
culture. (Mind you, she had never visited.) I replied that it was indeed
difficult, but that Americans had admirably adapted over the years:
whenever cultural void became unbearable, they would just grab their
surfboard and ride the waves. ;-)

(Uhh..., of course they would drive down to the beach in their **VWs**.)
