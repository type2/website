&gt; &gt; I was in a VW-only junk yard yesterday (Bud's Bugs, Concord, CA) and saw
&gt; &gt; an aux air regulator sitting on the front seat of a waterboxer Vanagon.

&gt; &gt; Start scouring those junk yards!

&gt; This goes for the air [intake] flow sensor. $360 new through VW dealer.

As for the air flow sensor--a local salvage yard found one on their
computer setup at a place in Wisconsin--$115 with warranty!

Might try your local salvage yard that advertises national searches.
