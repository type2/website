Subject: Nifty clutch/acc cable tip(?)

Hi everyone:

I wanted to relay an idea I had years ago that *worked*!  Mainly to see if
others have thought of it.  My 67 Mircobus (now sold) and my 60 Singlecab
(still have) were notorious for breaking clutch and acc cables every 6 or
12 months.  Sometimes getting German cables prolonged their lives somewhat,
but I discovered a way to blow off having to change the accelerator cable
pretty much forever in the process.  Since I had lots of broken clutch
cables (at the rear where the end is clamped on is where most of mine
broke) I decided to use two of them to make a semi-permanent accelerator
cable.  Can't remember off hand whether I had to change the front connector
on the cable, but it's not hard if you do.  Just saw off the old
accelerator cable and drill the remainder out to the size of the clutch
cable.  Then connect to the pedal linkage and thread the thing through the
tube.  The clutch cable is shorter than the acc cable, so you need to use
part of a second cable.  Join the two segments between the end of the tube
at the rear and the tube through the engine tin with an old piece of metal
fuel tubing about 4 inches long (I had lots of these over the years, maybe
everybody does!) by clamping the tube around the cable using a pair of
dikes to crimp it in several places onto the cable.  Thread the end of the
thing through the engine tin, and *carefully* cut it to the proper length
(the cable is about the same diameter as the original acc cable end).  Make
sure the strands are all together at the end, and solder the last couple of
inches so it won't be forced apart when you tighten the screw (actually, it
might be better to solder *before* cutting, now that I think about it).
After I put these in my splitties, I never had to change the acc cable
again (but you could remove it by pinching apart the crimped tube with
pliers if you needed to get it off).  Mainly needed to do this on my bus,
which for a while I had a set of 34ITC Webers on (I later gave up on these,
as the throttle bushings wore out pretty fast and the engine stayed in tune
and lasted much longer with the stock carb - I know, I tried several cheap
modifications over the 375K miles I put on the bus).

Hope this is a useful tidbit of info for someone.

Cheers!
