Subject: RE: need ventilation in rear of vanagon


_______________________________________________________________________________

Speaking of rear vent windows for ventilation, does anyone have a suggestion
as to how I can get more air in my '81 westy while sleeping?  The mid
windows of course have the sliders with screens, and this helps, but
I'd love it if the 2 rear windows had this as well.  Is it possible
to find some of the midwindows at the junkyard and put them in place
of the rear windows?  Other suggestions?

  Something I'd seen in London in office windows was a small fan
  set INTO the window... I wonder if that could be done with a
  fan or vent on a Vanagon window?
