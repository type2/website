Subject: ISBN, tools, ect.

 Hold the ISBN's and book names. I think I have them all, even in German,
which mine is a little rusty, but maybe I can read them.

 Thanks to the two people that sent me the list of books. You know who you
are and hope that you received my reply message.

 The only items I am needing are the tools required and at least one manual
for buses pre-1963. Since I have non of the ones listed, I could not tell if
any of them cover the 1962 and prior.

 Last but not least: sources of prices for old vehicles. Hemmings... was
mentioned. Are there any more?

 TIA.
