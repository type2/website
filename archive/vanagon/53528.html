Subject: digijet timing

Hello all
	I have recently rebuilt my 1.9 L Wasserboxer and have a 
question about the timing.  Before I disassembled the engine I marked
the position of the distributor.  Today I checked the timing and
found that It was timed contrary to what Bently says.  Bently says
that this sytem (digijet) should be 5deg ATDC with respect to
timing.  This engine was actually timed at 5deg before TDC.  I tried
turning the distributor to time at ATDC but the engine stalls!

A few notes:
The engine runs very well with this timing.
Is this a typo by Bentlry (ha ha)?
Or do I not know what ATDC means (after top dead center?)

Any response would be welcome...
I am no longer a list member so responses should be sent to

Thanks Robert
