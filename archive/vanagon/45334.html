Subject: Re: Steering Locks


&gt;&gt;&gt;they made optional ones for all years until they were standard (69?).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;My '73 doesn't have one.
&gt;- - - -
&gt;
&gt;well, this just shows my ignorance of late (post 67) vws.  note that i put 
a
&gt;? there.
&gt;
&gt;however, the 73 i had did have a steering lock.  also, 69 is the first year
&gt;for steering locks for beetles.      anyone know more?


My '69 bus had a steering lock, which was very difficult to defeat the
one time I tried (no, that's not how I acquired the bus).

My '71 didn't, which surprised me. But that bus was &quot;swept off the floor&quot;
as they say-- I found one receipt for the engine from a junkyard, another
receipt for the body from a different junkyard, etc. Maybe it had a
transplanted steering column, from a '68 perhaps?

Ah, the mysteries with which our loaves constantly titillate us...  :^)
