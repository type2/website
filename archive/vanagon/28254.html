Subject: Re: Fast idle Vanagon 1991


Julio queries:
 
&gt; I own a 1991 Vanagon (fuel injection) and for the last two months it has 
&gt; been idling at 2000 rpm. When the problem started last July (my God has 
&gt; it bee this long!) the car would only idle at high rpm when hot, but for 
&gt; the last two months no matter what the temperature it almost immediatly 
&gt; after starting it goes up to 2000 rpm.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anybody help ?

I'll give it shot. It sounds like the idle stabilizer.

I don't have my Bentley with me but this component can be diagnosed
using the procedure outlined in Bentley.

Maybe someone on the list can provide that info.
