Subject: Alert:Water tube

Just a Warning for the waterboxers on the list. Due to the recent 
rear-ending of White Wing II (86 vanagon) The water tube from the 
pump to the thermostat housing was jarred heavily. The rust that I 
thought was surface was foun to be internal and through the steel. It 
basically looked like a flute when we got it off. Mechanic said maybe 
20 feet to a mile before it blew and I lost all coolant. Sorry about 
the length of this but thought it might be helpful to pass on to the 
list.
