Subject: re:'79 bus:starts, doesn't start


&gt;&gt;ta-daa! It actually turns over and starts just fine.  So I drive it home,
&gt;&gt;shut it off and turn it over again. . .and it starts again, no problem.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I try it again this morning, and nothing.  I try several times in
&gt;&gt;succession, but nothing happens though the indicator lights work f

&gt;Disconnect your battery ground cable, remove the wires from the starter
&gt;solenoid and clean them up (and the stud) or replace the cable connections
&gt;with some high quality connectors.  If it works, you got off easy,  if not,
&gt;probably is the starter.

Second that. My bus did precisely the same thing when I got it. The
electrical connections at the starter get crust in them, try cleaning them
before you spend money. If it were the solenoid you could probably hear it
trying to work.
