Subject: Re:  Exhaust System- EGR filter on 82 Westy

hey tim,

i've got a '78 which has no EGR filter or catalytic converter since
the first rebuild six years ago.  it runs great but here in north
carolina where i recently moved, i've had some trouble with the 
new emissions requirements.  basically, you won't have a problem
rumbling around, so long as you plug the holes appropriately (mine
are welded).  just be aware of the possible future impact of any
clean air requirments.  

oh, and when the EGR filter was removed, I didn't live where there
were any emission requirements so think of your westy's glorious
future in your decision.

just a heads up...
