Subject: '74 Westy value?

Well, I've had no luck so far trying to sell my 1974 Westfalia.  I originally 
posted it at $2500/OBO and I've had nary a nibble.  The van is in good 
condition (not perfect, but darned nice).  Odometer shows about 150K miles, 
with a recent rebuild. 

I've posted it to this list, rec.autos.vw, the Grateful Dead newsgroup, and 
various for-sale groups, to no avail.  It's time now to start the expensive 
advertising.  We're in Pittsburgh, PA. 

What I *need* is some idea of what to expect from this thing.  The body is 
in good condition, with minor surface rust in spots.  The pop-top has a few 
small tears, but is mostly intact.  The interior camping stuff is not very 
original, but everything functions.  All upholstery is original and in
good shape 
except that the front seats need to be repadded. 

So, am I crazy to expect over 2 grand for this?  I'd have no interest in
selling 
it at all if it weren't for the fact that my wife and I are trying to
buy a house.
