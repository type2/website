Pete, 
I take it that you're going to use them. If not spread the wealth! ;) I need
to get tires for my Vanagon and the '67 westy that were doing. At least I
can make note of the tire size for when I go shopping. Let's hope that I can
score similar to your little find. Congrats and thanks for sharing the story!


&gt;In the lot, the dealer had a set of Goodyear G-64, 6-ply, 195-70 and had no
idea about what they fit or how to get rid of them.
