&gt; &gt; In the good(?)old days, radiators on Detroit iron used to be serviceable
&gt; &gt; at radiator shops:  one could have them &quot;rodded-out&quot; to restore cooling
&gt; &gt; system efficiency that had gradually been lost due to build up of
&gt; &gt; deposits in the tubes.  Can anyone tell me if the cross-flow radiator in
&gt; &gt; the vanagon (84 in particular) is similarly serviceable?  Or is it
&gt; &gt; another of those modern conveniences that is &quot;serviced&quot; by buying a new
&gt; &gt; one?  Has anyone had experience taking their Vanagon radiator to a
&gt; &gt; radiator shop?

I got several nice private replies.  The bottom line is that the
aluminum and plastic radiator is NOT a candidate for the old procedure
of rodding out.  But according to one reply, at least some radiator
shops have kept up with the times and use methods of cleaning which do
not require disassembly of the tanks from the core.  One mentioned a
technique that sounds like ultrasonic cleaning.  Check around and
actually visit some shops and ask questions.

My strategy is going to be to try to buy a good used radiator which I
can take to a modern, high-tech radiator shop (oxymoron or what ;^) and
have tested and cleaned.  Doing that will allow me to minimize the down
time on my van, as well as provide the means to get the radiator to the
shop in the first place.  I'll then  combine the radiator swap out with
a flush job on the rest of the cooling system.  Project goes on the
list  for spring maintenance on the BAJA VAN, along with a change to
synthetic tranny oil.
