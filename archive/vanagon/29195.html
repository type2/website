&gt;  feel better about this deal. It looks factory.  There is a nice green

Congrats on the new ride,
	I have the factory accessory heater setup on my '79 bus (which 
some may remember has the starter problem -- I didn't get a chance to 
work on it this weekend :( ) My mechanic buddy won't even work on it for 
me. It seems he once had an explosion which shot him out from under a bus 
while working on an auxilary heater and he is understandably a bit 
hesitant to put himself in such situation again any time soon.  
	Do you have an owner's manual with your Westy?  If not, I will 
gladly copy the relevant pages from mine and send them to you. The 
explanation of how to operate the system is there, but nothing on 
maintaining or fixing the system.  
	Good luck 
dave.
