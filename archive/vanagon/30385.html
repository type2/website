Just a quick note with respect to the leaking heater core.

There is a seal (square cross-section o-ring) at the joint between the valve and
the heater core.  This hardens with time and heat and may start leaking.  
Tightening the two small bolts won't stop the leak.  An easy test is to put a 
little side to side pressure on the joint which should cause a rush of coolant 
to squirt out.

So before you condemn your heater core, check it out.  $1.00 vs. $80 and up.

&gt;If these questions have been recent threads, feel free to just email 
&gt;me directly.  Any replies are greatly appreciated!

Actually, I think ALL of these have been recent threads.
     
In answer to your questions:
     
1)  Yes, Bentley seems to be oblique sometimes.
     
2)  Yes, if your rear heater core leaks, turn it off until 
you can replace it.  If shutting it off solves the leaking 
problem, then the core is bad, not hoses.  Prevailing 
viewpoint is that repair of these is difficult but doable.
     
3)  Defroster vent cable...now what was that solution?
     
4)  Yes, vanagon parts are expensive and everyone has an 
opinion on where to go for replacements.  Bus Boys has some 
Vanagon parts too.  Some have been unhappy with Parts Place, 
Inc.
     
5)  Driving in snow/ice with a Vanagon (2WD) is not a major 
problem if you have good rubber, but remember your weight is 
in the back when you turn or you fishtail big time.
     
6)  You should not need to block off your radiator on a trip 
to Milwaukee unless it gets way below zero (F).
     
7)  The Old Bus Rescue Squad (northern Illinois chapter) is 
here in DeKalb, Illinois if you need help in the area.  I 
believe your Vanagon qualifies as old enough.
     
Any one else?
