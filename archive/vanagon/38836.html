Subject: Re: Dormobile Tops &amp; other junkyard finds

Went to Alabama today to negotiate the price on a top off a '66
Dormobile to go on my '65 Sundial Camper.  The guy said it could 
be mine for $100.  Does this sound like a fair price?
-------

I don't know about price, but be sure you put in sub floors on your bus if
you will put in a dormer top.  i know i've posted this before, but to flog a
dead horse, it is needed for structural stability.  All splitty sunroof buses
had them, and dormobiles were built on sunroof combi bodies.


I popped it up and there were no tears in the vinyl sides and 
there were no broken bows.  There were two cots in the top, one 
with the canvas intact, the other with cargo netting.  Was this 
how they came?
-------

what i've seen had two cots, both made of the same stuff. i think it was
canvas, but i don't know for sure

The glass skylights were fine, but one of the ventilation lids 
was missing, with a piece of plywood in it's place.  Anyone know 
a source for the lids?
-----
Ric and Susan Crandall know an amazing amount about campers, westies and
Dormobiles in particular.  they reproduce parts for dormer tops.  I think
they advertised in OBR, as they are NEATO  members.
