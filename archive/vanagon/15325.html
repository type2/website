&gt; &gt; On my friend's 87 Vanagon Westfalia there is a propane leak coming out of a
&gt; &gt; tiny hole in the box just left of the main valve.  What is the purpose of
&gt; &gt; the box?  Is the hole part of a relief valve or does the box have to be
&gt; &gt; replaced? 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Where can I get spare parts for the propane system?  Is there a good place
&gt; &gt; to get this fixed in the San Francisco Bay area? 
&gt; &gt;

&gt; 
&gt; I don't know what that box is for at this moment.  Sorry.

Isn't it the plastic box/cover over the reg? Constant gas leak from
there means that you nead a new reg.
