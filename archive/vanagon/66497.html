Chris,

I've run Castrol (sp?) 5-50w synthetic in my last '86 westy and put 150,000
miles on it without one engine problem.  My SAAB 9000 has 250,000 miles
using synthetic and is going strong.  When I purchased my '91 westy it had
28,000 miles and I changed to synthetic.  I hope I can get 200,000+ from
this one. I change my oil every 5,000 miles and use a good filter.  I know
it cost more but I feel its worth it.

&gt; Hey folks,
&gt;
&gt; I am sure this topic has been batted around a bit on the list but I was
&gt; wondering what the general consensus is on synthetic motor oil vs.
regular
&gt; oil. It's about that time for our Westy to get relubed and I have been
&gt; pondering the pros and cons. Are synthetics beneficial for the Westy?
&gt;
&gt; TIA
&gt;
&gt; Chris
