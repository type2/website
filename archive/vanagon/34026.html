Subject: Re: quick question--- 

&gt;I stongly disrecommend the cheap ones that have a rubber plug you press into
&gt;the spark plug hole; I always hurt myself using one and I don't trust them to
&gt;be accurate; it's really easy to hold them off-axis and have them leak when
&gt;you are trying to avoid getting caught in the fan belts.

        Yeow! Sounds like crapolah to me... Mine is a screw in as well,
minus the adapters, and was around $20, as I said. I would agree that the
rubber plug one is junk, sight unseen. The design just plain *sounds*
crappy.

Peace,
