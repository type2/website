Check the gopher regarding VIN numbers: it can tell you where the model
was made and the original equipment. It's at gopher halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu

&gt; My VIN is WV2ZB0257FH051307.  In looking at some tech bulletins, they 
&gt; refer to VINs liek 25 FM 050 887 Dec 84 and 25 FH 037 898 Nov 94.  My 
&gt; camper was picked up on site in Germany in late January, 85, so I suppose 
&gt; it was built sometime in the fall of '84 - around the VINs shown.
&gt; 
&gt; So - how do I read my VIN to know whether mine is earlier or later than 
&gt; those show?
&gt; 
&gt; I assume skip everything up to the 25, then skip the 7.  Is that right?  
&gt; And how do I get a date out of that?  Thanks.
