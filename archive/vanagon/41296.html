Subject: Re: intermittant part II


&gt;Here's what the '79 switch has:
&gt;There are four wires that lead to contacts in the switch which
&gt;correspond to the various positions of the wiper switch.  However, as we
&gt;know it now (non-intermittant), there are only three positions:  the
&gt;first position where bump it up a little and the wipers sweep once, the
&gt;low position, and the high position.  That accounts for three of the
&gt;contacts -- check me here, I'm not sure I know quite how the
&gt;wiper switch works.
&gt;
I may not know what I'm talking about here, I haven't played with a wiper
switch.  But if it is as you say, one contact for the pulse wipe, one for
low and one for high, there should be a fourth contact which completes the
circuit (the ground wire.  Or possibly the hot wire even.)
