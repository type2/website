&gt;Question one-- I am concerned that I do not have an air-flow thermostat.
&gt;When I rebuilt the engine there was *no* control assembly for the air
&gt;flaps to remove. I did not consider putting one on. I have read the
&gt;posts on where it should be, and what it looks like, and its important
&gt;role in keeping the engine cool.  This could be a likely culprit, huh?

I know that there will be plenty of responses saying &quot;the VW designers put
this in there for a *reason*...&quot; but I don't think that it really effects
you, as you say.  I live in Houston, close enough climate-wise, and haven't
had any of that &quot;thermostat stuff&quot; since Thanksgiving of '78.  The only
problems that I've had with temperature since then have been improper
timing (too much advance) and too much boogie (sustained 70mph plus in
100-degree weather).  Your engine doesn't need this.

&gt;Question two-- *If* this is indeed the problem, what is your opinion
&gt;concerning removing the shroud and simply *scrapping* the whole air
&gt;control flap assembly?  Remember, I am currently in Texas--there is not
&gt;much of a cold-start problem here.

Like I said above...

&gt;Question three-- Apparently, the carb and timing settings are crucial in
&gt;helping keep the engine cool. I would just about bet my ass that I have
&gt;the carb and timing set properly.  Just to make sure, though, let me tell
&gt;you that I have the timing set at 7.5 BTDC, and it seems to run fine--no
&gt;pinging, smooth acceleration.  Your insight?

I'm running an 009 distributor set to roughly 30 degrees total advance
(using a Snap-On variable-advance timing light).  With this setting I do
pretty good, but I used to overheat at 35 degrees, which is what I was lead
to believe was the proper setting for this distributor.  Proper adjustment
of a carburetor is still tantamount to magic to me, so I just rebuild and
pray...
