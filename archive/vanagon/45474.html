Subject:  turtle is vermont bound

greetings.

i've now driven 1,500 miles since getting my newly rebuilt van back 2
wks ago, and i must say i'm very happy with the smooth performance
(aside from an initially disappointing total loss of power at one point, but
then i joyfully realized that i was an idiot and ran out of gas because we
were just going down the road so well and i hadn't felt like stopping).  i'm
confident that we're now ready for a real trip, so i'll be driving from
michigan through ontario to vermont saturday to pick up friends in
burlington, then possibly onward to maine.  if you see a white high-top
air-cooled vanagon with a bearded young man and beaded seats inside,
it's probably us. 

good spirit, matthew and mobius (81 adventurewagen)

ps - i think that mobius is kind of like a turtle with its home on its back and
its appropriate pace, and i don't usually like stickers, but if anyone sees a
cool turtle sticker for the window i'd gladly send you $$ to send it to me.
