Subject: Teflon tape &amp; oil fittings


To All:

Properly applied, Teflon tape makes an excellent sealant for oil &amp; gas
fittings.  Gene Berg's comments regarding its use failed to make clear that
the original problem occured when Gene or one of his staff wrapped too much
Teflon on a stock oil pressure warning light switch.  The key-word here is
'switch', as in electrical.  Teflon is a marvelously effective insulator.  If
the full length of the fitting was taped it would insulate  the oil pressure
warning light switch from the crankcase and thus fail to make the circuit.

Shards of Teflon tape have been found welded to the bearing shells in some
engines.  This results when someone wraps the tape too near the end of the
fitting causing bits of tape to be cut off when it is torqued into the
threaded hole.  Being a high-temperature plastic and insoluable in oil, the
shards of tape will circulate through the engine until trapped.  In the case
above, they got as far as the main bearing shells.  Teflon tape has caused
tappet and cam failures by blocking the oil passages.

When using Teflon tape in automotive service, always leave the first two
threads of the fitting bare and never use Teflon tape when installing
electircal switches that ground through the threads -- use Permatex.
