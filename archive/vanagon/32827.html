Subject: vanagon shock absorbers

Anyone besides Joel have any experience with replacement
shock absorbers for the vanagon. I've looked in the archives
and came up with Joel's recommendation for hard to find
Koni shocks. Otherwise the archives is a little lacking for
vanagon shock info. I'm looking for a good after market shock,
nothing that will raise the height of the van or anything too
elaborate, also this is RWD, so I don't have the same concerns
that Syncro's have.
Now that I have a garage I would like to take on some of the 
smaller projects like shocks, brakes and greasing of CVs.

TIA,
