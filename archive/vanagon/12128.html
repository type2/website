On Monhis list comes partly from a parts list, 27 Feb 1995 L.S.Griffiths_at_physics.salford.ac_dot_uk wrote:

Dear Lee and All--

In the next issue of Old Bus Review (if I can fit it all in!) will be a 
list of all the &quot;M&quot; options for Type 2s. This list comes from Transporter 
Parts Lists published in English &amp; German. The M list to be printed is 
for the pre-'68s, though some may be relevant for later ones, too. I 
don't have all the text yet, but will soon. It's fairly complete with 
numbers M1 to M729. There are a few gaps, which even the Bulli-Kartei 
club in Germany has not ben able to fill.
