So Matthew Drahzal says:
&gt; Ok Folks,
&gt; 
&gt;   My son (13) had a hissy fit last night about NuBus ('82 Diesel).
&gt; These were some of his quotes:
&gt; 
&gt;  &quot;I Hate that freaking car&quot;
&gt; 
&gt;  &quot;It's so ugly&quot;
&gt; 
&gt;  &quot;It's so loud&quot;  &quot;It's so stupid&quot;  &quot;I'd rather walk&quot;

So let him walk.

&gt; He threatened to ignore us if we picked him from the 
&gt; school dance tonight in the bus...

Then let him ignore you.


I liked the 'drown him in a bucket' advice best.  ;)

Cheers!
