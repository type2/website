&gt;I have a 1991 vw vanagon carat.  It is loosing coolant but nothing is 
&gt;finding its way to the ground.  My fear is that it's leaking into the 
&gt;head, which I hear is not that uncommon.  The guy who works on my van says 
&gt;if that the problem, it will cost about 4k.   Ouch!  Any suggestions?
&gt;
&gt;This is not my first VW. I've had a '64 camper, a '67 bug, a '69 and '70 
&gt;bus, and now this one, which has 75000 miles on it and still looks new.
