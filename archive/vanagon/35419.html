Subject:       Re: Something positive

&gt; have run without any real problems.  Has anyone out there been able to go  
&gt; one year (everyday driving) with a 15 year old or greater, high milage bus
&gt; without any breaksdowns or problems (besides regular maintanence)?  I would
&gt; be interested in the reliability one can get out of these &quot;classics&quot;.

I can honestly say my engine (1776cc) has run without any major 
problems for the 4 years I've had it.  It's been in two busses, and 
only had the obligatory oil changes and tune-ups.

Of course I should qualify myself and say that the engine was built 
only 1000 miles before I bought it!  So I dunno if that counts.

On the other end of the spectrum, I still can't cure my bus brakes.  
I've given up and just drive with the fear of God, hoping that I 
don't ever get called upon for a super fast stop.
