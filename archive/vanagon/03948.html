Me too.

&gt; I have two questions:
&gt; 1.  My 82 diesel Westfalia camper, which I've had for about 6-months, 
&gt; seems to pump out an inordinate amount of heat from the dashboard heater 
&gt; area even when the heater is off. Is this just something I have to live 
&gt; with or am I doing something wrong as far as heater lever settings or is 
&gt; something haywire mechanically. The BEDBUG seems to run great otherwise. 

I also made a purchase of a 82 diesel Westfalia in May.  My problem was 
figuring out how to get the heat ON!  I don't quite have it down yet, but 
moving the slider with the red square (or is it a dot?) on one end and 
the blue square on the other regulates the temp.  As for getting it to 
come out of the right vent (like the foot vent) I am still working on 
that.  Start with the pictogram next to the controls for defrosting and 
then expand your knowledge from there.

&gt; The BEDBUG seems to run great otherwise.
&gt; This is my first vw of any type. It fulfills a dream I've had for better 
&gt; than 20-years. I love it.

This is my first vw westy.  It's nice for camping, but I'm not so hot on 
the fact that I can only go up Stevens Pass in 2nd gear at 28 M.P.H.  
It's almost a dead heat with the bicyclists that pedal over the pass.  
Maybe I just need more time to slip into the vw state of mind.


&gt; 2.  I live in the Pacific Northwest (Olympia, WA, to be exact). 

Hmmm.  I'm in Bothell, WA ... to be exact.

&gt; Is there a dealer up here that sells awnings designed for vw campers or 
&gt; similar? 

Don't know.  I gave this a thought myself, I have decided to not add any 
more weight as the poor motor is working hard enough already.  If you 
really want it though, Try Bow-Wow in Seattle.  If they can't get it, 
they know where you can.  They are a specialty vw shop.  On most of my 
Westfallia requests they have referred me to the several RV stores in town.
 

                      LATER,
                             Brad
