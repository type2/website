Subject: Re: '78 bus fuel gauge acting wierd

Brian, I'd have to agree with the previous post.
Shot sender unit!

I've replaced two in the past that have had similar behavior. The only
design for the mechanism that I've seen do this is essentially a
non-conducting plate with wire wrapped in very close (but not touching)
spirals around the skinny dimension. A float sits on one end of a lever
and a button-like metal contact on the other. As the float moves across the
wire like a pick on guitar strings, that contact *eventually* either wears
itself out (allowing the metal tang it's attached to to touch the wire in
multiple places) or it frays the wire through (allowing the loose end to
float around and make intermittant contact with the tang). An older design
was made like a cork with a rod through it (in a tube)  with attached metal
contacts that clipped to two vertical wires. This kind was undoubtedly more
expensive to make, but I never saw one fail. Replacing sender unit through
access hole (can you say *nibbler* boys and girls?) is the way to go.

This is probably more than *anyone* needs to know about this subject. I'll
think I'll go hit myself on the head to forget ;)

What were we talking about?


&gt;        Hello all, my problem is that my fuel gauge is possesed, but only
&gt;when it hits 1/4 of a tank.  I bought this bus in November and have not
&gt;had any problems with it until now.  When my fuel gauge gets down to 1/4
&gt;of a tank it starts changing positions dramatically dropping to the
&gt;bottem of the reserve and then going back up to 1/4 and even sometimes to
&gt;1/2.  It never did this before and registers fine when stopped, but when
&gt;driving at constant speeds and not climbing and hill or bumps it just
&gt;freaks out and doesn't stop until I do.  This started last week and I
&gt;checked the connectiond for the wires in the back of the gauge, and they
&gt;are all snug.  It tends to make your heart skip a beat when you start
&gt;with 1/4 of a tank and then 10 minutes later you got nothing on the
&gt;gauge, and you don't smell fuel.
&gt;        So is this fixable, bus personality, or should I call a priest?
