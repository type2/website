Subject: East Coasters' Canadian Trek

     We should do this! Whatever/wherever!  Here are some thoughts on the
     details:

     The ferry from Portland to Nova Scotia is expensive. We took it
     a few years ago, then came back via the shorter, cheaper ferry
     running to St. John: whenever our next time for NS happens, we
     will take the St. John ferry.

     One great aspect of the Inuvit trip is the idea of the great strike to
     the far north. We should do something similar, something that is a bit
     of a challenge, and not just touring around the (very beautiful, from
     my experience) east side of Canada.

     The trek should be in August, but the tour end should be timed to
     allow enough time for participants to proceed to Busses By The Arch in
     St. Louis on Labor Day Weekend. Besides allowing us to attend BBTA,
     the prospect of a caravan return to the midwest might entice some
     central US listmembers.
