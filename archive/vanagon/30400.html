Subject: Official Band Announcement

Hey now,
        It's not 100% VW related, but close enough for me. There's lots of
Dead Heads on this list. Sorry to waste your time if you're not one of
them/us. I can't get through to the hotline to verify this, so I figure
it's for real. Bummer, but I kind of expected it. Jerry was too much of a
loss.
