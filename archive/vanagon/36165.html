Subject: A little red tag that kept getting tangled in her hair...

     I was 17, and had mentioned to my father that I was thinking of
buying a rubber boat for use as a scuba platform.  My father managed to
get me one from the F.A.A where he worked. (Don't ask, I never did).
     What he brought me was one of those Air Force survival rafts that
they issue to bomber crews with up to 10 men. I couldn't wait to test it,
so I called Jason, and told him to come on over. I took the back seat out
of my VW bug, and laid the seat back down. This makes a VW bug kind of
like a hatch back without the hatch. Jason got over to my place, just as
our girlfriends showed up. They had come over to see if we wanted to go
swimming. I crammed the raft and both girls in the back of the VW (it was
really tight), and Jason in the passenger seat up front, and took off. I
got onto I-35 in Oklahoma City to head for one of the area lakes. The
windows were down and the hot August wind was roaring through the car like
a minor hurricane. My girlfriend started complaining about the wind, and
a little red tag that kept getting tangled in her hair. I told her not to
mess with the tag, but she got mad and gave it a good hard yank, intending
to throw it out the window. Can you guess what that little red tag was
for? Yep, that damned raft started to inflate right there in the VW!  It
takes about 15 seconds for one of those things to inflate, and for the
first 5 seconds or so I was frozen with something of a mixture fear,
amazement, and a sense of this really can't be happening! In the 6th
second the raft started pushing my head down against the steering wheel
hard enough that I couldn't really see where I was going, and started
pushing the windows that weren't down out of their frames, and onto the
road.  By the time I got my wits back, the raft was fully inflated.
     I managed to push my head up enough to see where I was going, and
hopefully avoid creaming anyone else on the road.  By this time the real
chaos had started. The girls were screaming their fool heads off, Jason
was laughing like an idiot, and the Oklahoma Highway Patrolman that had
been follwing me when all this started had turned on his siren.  I finally
got the car to the center median, and stopped. I got hold of the door
handle to open the door and pulled. The door shot open, and the raft
exploded out of the car pushing me ahead of it. When I got to my feet,
the first thing I saw was the OHP cop laughing so hard he had tears
running down his cheeks, and having a hard time breathing.  I managed to
get the deflate mechanism activated, and the raft started to deflate. By
this time the cop was breathing again, and somewhat coherant. He came over
and told me that was the funniest thing he had ever seen. I asked if I
was going to get a ticket?  He said no, he just wanted to make sure no
one got hurt. We folded the raft as best we could, and went back to my
place. The real fun was trying to convince my insurance company that all
that glass damage really was because a life raft had inflated inside the
car. They did pay off, but only after the insurance adjuster had talked
to the OHP cop.  I can look back on this now and laugh. But for about 5
years after that happened, anytime someone (Jason usually) mentioned it,
all I could do was turn red in the face.
