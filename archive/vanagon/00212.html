Subject: Hunting idle, jerking bucking Vanagon woes!!!
Date: Mon, 11 Apr 1994 16:31:55 -0500 (CDT)

Well, I bought the wiring harness fix last Friday (thought that it couldn't
hurt) and the Van now has gone into it's idle hunt mode twice on Saturday,
and twice today (Monday).  It seems to be running better (when it runs
right).

I'm seriously thinking about selling this thing to some unsuspecting soul
and getting something different (Golf ///?)

What's going on???  Do I really have no other option than to replace the ECU
($$$).  

I've replaced:
Air Flow Sensor
Fuel pressure regulator
Plug Wires ($$$)
Plugs 
Oxygen Sensor
Fuel Filter
Air Filter
Oil and Filter
I've cleaned every ground I can find (Weeelll, now that I think of it I
havn't cleaned the front strap from the tranny to the frame, but I did clean
the one from the left head to the frame)
Fiddled with the idle stabilizer


The other thing that I was wondering about was those stupid throttle
switches... I tested them a while back, and at that time they were fine.  I
priced them also... they were like $50 each!!! For a f*ckin microswitch.  I
just assumed that if they were that expensive and they seemed o.k. I would
leave them alone.  But now I am thinking along those routs again.



Bottom line....   Has anyone else had this problem and FIXED it??????

If so what did you do????  Or did the dealer just finally get it right for
you by replacing the whole wiring harness?!?

Thanks.  I'm slightly annoyed!!!
