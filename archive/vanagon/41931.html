Subject: Another V6anagon?

I just saw the March-April issue of &quot; The Transporter&quot; (LiMBO's newsletter)
and under the &quot;Welcome New Members!&quot; column is a guy by the name of Steve
Crise in Culver City, CA who has an '86 crew cab with a chevy V6!

Could this guy be a kindred spirit to our illustrious Mr. Maher, or is it
his evil twin?

Whaddya think Steve, do you know this guy?

cheers,

Bren

I accidentally installed the deer whistles on my VW backwards. Now
everywhere I go, I'm chased by a herd of deer.
