Subject: Re: *Front* Engine *Compartment* Seal

&gt;Sorry for the misnomer in my first post regarding installing a new front
&gt;engine seal.  I meant to say engine *compartment* seal, that is, the seal
&gt;that keeps the engine compartment sealed against the engine tin--you know,
&gt;the one between the fan housing and the gas tank.  I would like to replace
&gt;this on my '71 Westy without removing the engine. (snip)

maybe i'm a techno peasant, but am still unsure of what gasket you are
referring to. The bell housing, the gasket around the engine trim, or the
rubber gasket that separates the gas tank bulkhead from the rest of the
engine compartment? i don't really understand
 &quot;the seal that keeps the engine compartment sealed against the engine tin&quot;??/




 Is it possible?
&gt;
&gt;If I could install a front *engine* seal without pulling the engine that
&gt;*would* be a neat trick wouldn't it?! ABRACADABRA.....
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
