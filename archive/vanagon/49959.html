Subject: 85 shifter problems

As a follow up to my orginal post;

At 140 K my van began to have some shifting problem.  Around town, fine, but
take it on extended trip at high speeds I have had problems getting it into
first, second, third.  Reverse, it tends to grind a little.  Bled the system
as people suggested (are you suppose to pump the clutch are just open the
bled valve and let it run out?).  Noticed no grinding for about ten miles
but then, back to the same old thing.  Cluth does not slip.  Could someone
post there experience in &quot;how to&quot; replace/rebuild the clutch master cylnder
and the slave cylinder?

Thanks,

Bill Lund
