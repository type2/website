The library here at the university gets VW Motoring every month and has 
every copy since it started. That was in the early sixties when it was 
called Safer Motoring. Its amazing to see some of the ads in those old 
magazines, like split window Beetles for 50 quid and new BRMs for 12 pounds 
each!!
