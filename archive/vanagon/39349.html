  Cool Stuff:

        3 early 60's taillights, with what I belive are glass lenses.
        1 elephant ear mirror
        1 late-50's-early -60's bug outside mirror.
        very, very early cast iron 009 distributor
        36hp distributor
------

I like the early cast mechanical advance distributors  (019).  They have a
better advance curve than the 009, though points are not as common.  The best
are the ones wuth the screw to *adjust* the points, instead of prying the
silly things.
