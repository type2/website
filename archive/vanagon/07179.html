Subject: busses in Chile

My significant other just got back from the south side of the world down in 
Chile and she said that there were VW buses all over the place, including 
pickups.  Don't know about splitties, though.  She saw some that were used as 
school buses no less.  The only pictures she brought back were of penguins, 
mtns and statues, but no buses.
