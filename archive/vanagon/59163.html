When I was checking the oil on the vanagon today, I noticed a strong
smell of gas.  I smelled the clean cloth I was using to check the oil
and found that the oil from the dip-stick smelled strongly of oil.  I
have been driving it pretty steadily the last two weeks since I changed
the oil, but there was no decrease in the oil level.  In fact, the level
was ABOVE the full line.

My basic (extremely basic) mechanical skills and knowledge of internal
combustion engines tells me that if there is gas in the oil, there is
only one way for it to get there: Past the piston seals in the jugs. 
And yet, I seem to be experiencing no loss of compression.  Lately there
has been times that the engine seems to be running extremely rich and
the exhaust has a strong smell of gas and is quite smokey.  It is an
intermittent problem.  I have checked all of the FI components and I do
not see any problems there.  Am I missing somthing?  Is the engine shot?
HELP!!
