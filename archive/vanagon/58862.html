&lt;&lt; Has anyone had experience painting or treating the flexible air dam on
 the bottom front of a late model Vanagon?  Mine is a 90 Carat and the
 black is faded and ugly.  Thanks in advance, &gt;&gt;


just remove it, clean it and spray it w/ &quot;Bumper Black&quot; or any comparable
spray paint found at your local FLAPS.
