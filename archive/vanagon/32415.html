Subject: What Is It??

You.ve heard it before and I'm sure you're gonna hear it 
again....&quot;I'm a newbe to this stuff, so please bear with me!&quot;

Anyway, I recently acquired a baby of an '80 Westie with only about 
240,000 km (68k on a factory rebuild).  I managed to find the Dyment 
Company in Ohio and ordered up the manuals (they had dissappeared) 
and this answered a lot of my questions.

However, there are a couple of things I still  need help with after 
reading the manuals and going through the various info available 
here.  Such as....

1)  There is a round hole trimmed in brushed aluminum and smaller 
than a cigarette lighter that is located on the dash to the left of 
the heater controls and it is HOT.  What is it ...some sort of a 
recepticle???  It appears to be factory installed.

2)  Tires, tires, tires....I see the one size the manual calls for 
and I've read some chatter about other sizes some of you folks have 
been using but I must have missed specifics of size somewhere.  
What's best for handling, mileage and performance???

3)  It would appear that I don't have a blower for the 
heater/defroster setup...is there such a beast and what is involved 
in installing one?  (My brother-in-law has one on his '78 and had one 
on his '73 so I want one too...bigger!!)

4)  Fridge doesn't work on either propane, 12VDC or 110VAC.

5)  I want to put in an auxiliary battery...should it be wired 
through an isolator, selector switch or neither?

That's it and thanks in advance for the help.
