VANRACKS of Norris, TN make bike racks that fit on the back of any type 
of van.  No drilling necessary.  Use the mounts off of your roof rack,
Thule e.g., to mount bikes onto your VANRACK.  email me for more info
or e-mail Mr. VANRACK himself at IDV1V.TVA.GOV/DD=IDV1V.TVA.GOV_at_mhs-tva.attmail

&gt;Hi all
&gt;I don't know if this has been covered to everyone's satisfaction, but.....
&gt;There are a ton of advertisements for bike racks that fit, via a variety of
&gt;means, to the back of a vehicle. Trailer hitch, rear window, etc.
&gt;The name of the magazine is Velo News and can be found at any decent bike
&gt;shop. If you can't find it I can give any info that is needed, I've got the
&gt;mag.
&gt;Hope this helps
&gt;
