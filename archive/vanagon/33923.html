Subject: Need advice on Westfalia purchase

Hi,

My wife and I are looking for a pre-1992 westfalia camper.

Are there any owners out there who could take the time to communicate
with us about various aspects of their campers

Model years we are likely to be looking at are 89, 90 and 91. I don't
think we can manage a '92 on our budget.

What we need to know is what does it look like inside? How does it
run? What is the fuel economy reallly like?

Things like that.

It would be very nice if someone could send us a video of the inside
of thiers, if they are very proud of the van.

We live in the Sub-Arctic about 1700 KM from the nearest VW dealer.

We are looking forward to hearing from someone.
