Could be either situation.  After warm-up, test the voltage output at 
3,000 RPM; you should see voltage fluctuation at this point.  If not, O2 
sensor is probably DOA.  Also, don't be shy about twisting that mixture 
screw to its extremes to see if you can detect a voltage change; just 
count your turns of the wrench one way and the other to bring it back to 
original setting. 

&gt; Reset mixture screw to original position.  Throttle screw is ALL the way 
&gt; in, no room for adjustment for lower RPMs, tho the idle RPM is correct.  
&gt; Adjusting out 2 turns made no change in RPM.

I'm just not convinced that spraying flamable stuff around is the right 
way to find leaks, which it sounds like you might have.  I sucessfully 
ran down a couple of leaks (which I didn't find using a propane torch) by 
pumping up the system with compressed air and going at everything with 
soapy water.
