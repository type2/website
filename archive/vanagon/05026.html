&gt; Just a heads up here -- the Trailhandlers ARE LT and C6 rated, and they

Does anyone have a (subjective) list of tires they've tried, with some
informative comments about each (great, horrid, bad traction, wear
quickly, etc.)  I'm not so concerned about price, because I can call
around and get the prices if I know a good tire to buy.

I recently bought some Michelin MXL 205/70R14R, which may have been a
mistake, because my old ones had their belts separating and were bulging,
and there was still a quite a bit of tread left ( on the non-bulging parts).

Anyway, at $74 a pop, I figure I could spend a few more dollars the next time
around and get either an all-weather tire, or nice big fat off-road tire
so my Syncro will get stuck in the mountains farther away from civilization.

Does anyone have comments or favorites to add to this list:

Michelin MXL Reinforced	205/70R14	6/B/40 		Good
Sears Trailhandler	?               6/C/50       	Horrid
