Subject: friday campspace for lakeport volksfest?


As some of you know, I've reserved a space at the Lakeport Volksfest
for Saturday evening right on the premesis at the local Fairgrounds,
which are supposed to be about 4 blocks from the lake.  I thought
it would be nice to camp elsewhere Friday nite, either at the Clearlake
State Park, or perhaps even over on the coast, maybe at Fort Bragg,
where we all might try to arrange a field trip to check out
the Adventurewagen business there.  Anyone interested?  Suggestions?

We should decide on this as soon as possible, as if we DO end up
preferring Clearlake State park, reservations will need to be made
thru Mistix.

Let me know asap..........
