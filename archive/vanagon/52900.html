Subject: Fridge problems


I have a 1979 Westy with a troublesome fridge.  It works when hooked up 
to house power, but doesn't want to work when switched to battery.  This 
one only works on electric, so I can't run it any other way.  

Is there anything I can check to see if the fridge is getting power, just 
not cooling?  General troubleshooting suggestions?  Any hints, comments, 
or pearls of wisdom are appreciated.

TIA,

Matt
