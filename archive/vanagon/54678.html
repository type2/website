 I'm using 5W-30, and have had no trouble starting. That being said, I
keep it in an unheated garage, and it is always plugged in when I am at
work. The few times that it has sat exposed to the elements for any period
(-20 C) it started fine. I also have an in-car warmer that keeps the
battery warm with the added perk that it keeps the cabin toasty
(relatively). Keep in mind that a lead acid battery loses about 50%
efficiency from room temp to 0 C (32 F); I've heard many claims that a
battery blanket is as good as a block heater.
