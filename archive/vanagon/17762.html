Guntram asks:

&gt;        is anyone going to the Michigan vw shows this weekend

Yes!  The VVWCA show on Sunday in Auburn Hills, anyhow.  A bunch of us from
VINTAGVW will be there.  Look for Greg Merritt's '71 squareback, parked in
the show.  It's yellow, and blue, and cyan, and... :-)

I've been twice before, and it is indeed a nice show.

Cheers!
Bill
