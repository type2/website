Subject: Re: 'roo bars?


&gt;The other thing I forgot to mention is that the Australian Government has 
&gt;found that the 4WDs and other chassis based vehicles are more dangerous 
&gt;to passengers because they don't have to progressive crumple zones built 
&gt;into them. Passengers come to a stop in a collision that much 
&gt;(millisecond) quicker, putting more strain on, and sustaining more damage 
&gt;from, the restraining devices, ie seatbelts (which the majority of Aussies 
&gt;wear). 'Roo bars only exacerbate the problem.

The same thing was found in the UK. 4WD owners (Chelsea farmers) seem
compelled to fit bull bars (similar sort of thing) even though they never
even see dirt and the only wild animal you're likely to meet on the road in
this country is a hedgehog. Their reasoning is that they save repairing
small dents and broken lights collected when parking and in light accidents
(if they drive that badly they shouldn't be let out of the house). The only
problem is, the bars transfer all the load straight to the chassis so
instead of bending a wing or grill you bend the chassis instead. Think about
it. Two tons of car, even moving slowly, has a lot of potential energy that
has to be dissipated somehow. The car is either written off because it's
uneconomical to repair or the owner doesn't realise, because the damage is
hidden from view, and carries on driving around with wonky suspension. Some
insurance companies are even refusing to pay for damage caused by the
fitting of bull bars. 
A more worrying problem is that the bars are about head height for small
kids. Manufacturers go to great lengths to make the front of cars deform in
accidents to be as safe as possible for both passengers and pedestrians. OK,
so its not nice to bounce a six year old off the bonnet but its better than
whacking him on the head with a hefty steel bar. 
Proper roo bars (like in Australia) aren't really meant to protect the car.
If you hit a couple of hundred kilos of kangaroo at high speed the car's
going to be wrecked anyway and bolting something to the front won't help one
bit. They angle forward, sort of like an upside-down cow-catcher, the idea
being to stop animals coming over the bonnet, through the windscreen and
killing the passengers.
