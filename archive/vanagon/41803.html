Subject: Will these wheels work on my '63 Bus?

	As I mentioned here before, I just put my '63 Deluxe on the 
road for the first time. The P.O. had put 14&quot; tires on instead of 
the 15&quot; size standard for '63.  Since I need new tires anyway, I've 
had my eye out for some 15&quot; bus wheels.
	Someone has offered me a set of 15&quot; chrome wheels that he 
says were on a Beetle he bought years ago.  They are significantly 
wider than standard Beetle rims, and are apparantly Brazilian. They 
accept the stock moon hubcaps, and have oval cut-outs around the 
edges (around the perimeter of the moon hubcaps).  The bolt pattern 
looks the same as the Bus pattern at casual glance. The owner wants 
$35 apiece for them, and they are in relatively good shape.
	Someone I asked said these might be aftermarket wide '66-'67 
Beetle wheels. He then laughed at me when I told him I was thinking 
of putting them on a bus.  Said he didn't even know if they'd work, 
and he's never heard of anyone putting any sort of Beetle rim on a 
Bus.  He advised that I hold out for the correct bus rims, even if 
they are not chrome. 
	Can anyone identify these wheels?  Is it a good idea to put 
them on a bus (or will they even fit)?  Also, is $140 for 4 a good 
price?

Thanks,
Ron Salmon
