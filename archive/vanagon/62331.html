Subject: A/C evaporator housing removal

I finally thought I'd check on those evaporator fan series resistors 
that someone suggested might be the problem with my A/C only working 
on the highest fan setting.  BTW, anyone have this problem before?  
Seems odd that series resistors from both motors would be fried.

Anyway, I started taking the left and right rear panels off and 
discovered that the evaporator housing flange on the right was 
cracked-no big surprise, from what I've heard, but it still sucks.  
Where's my erector set...gotta find an angle bracket. :-)

Anyway, I decided to reverse the process after checking around the 
various fuses and relays in the left rear panel.  Bentley says to use 
a support when lowering the housing.  It did seem rather heavy (I had 
to push it back up to get the right rear panel back on), but is that 
really necessary?  Is this whole thing gonna come down and snap off 
freon lines in the process if I don't?

Also, I know people say you have to take the whole duct system down 
starting at the front; is this really necessary too?  Seems like I 
should be able to slip it off the rearmost center duct.

Thanks,

-Karl, who's happy to at least have A/C in windtunnel mode (high fan 
setting).  :-)
