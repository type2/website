&gt; Except for those with Syncros, which have an 18.5 gallon fuel capacity.

Here's question for the other Syncro owners.  When my gas gauge reads 
almost to the bottom of the reserve area, it only takes about 16 gals 
to fill the tank.

It seems like the gas gauge is calibrated for a 16 gallon tank rather
rather than the bigger 18.5. Any other syncro owners notice this?
