Subject: Re: Splittie with wrong size wheels

I would go with all 15&quot; wheels.  Funny though, as long as the axles have the
same size on both sides, it should not make it handle that badly.

Are you sure your shocks are good/  The ride on a split is supposed to be
tight,  not sqishy like a car or a later bus.  Hows the play in the steering.
 You could jack it up and check wear in the kingpins (wobble when you push
pull at 12 and 6 o clock)  and tie rods etc (wobble from 3 to 9 oclock.)

just a thought
