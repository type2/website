&gt;Lap times equal to more than 75mph disqualify you for being
&gt;unsafe and not with the program.

Ba ha ha!

I guess I shouldn't laugh because you're including water-cooled
and later VW's.  When I try to imagine my '80 westy going fast
enough to *average* 75 mph, I have to laugh.  The '72 bus might
be able to get up to 80 tops, but that would give maybe a 60mph
average around the Bay...

I think the Tour sounds like a fun idea, even if it's a little
crazy.  I'm getting too old to stay up all night, though.

Good Luck!
Dennis
