&gt;I suppose theoretically you could get a hard top deluxe ordered with a
&gt;sunroof, but there is no number for that body type, and i think it highly
&gt;unlikely.

Yes, you could.  I've seen one.  A guy here in Sacramento has it.

Wierd!  Are you sure it's not a custom job?   What does the M tag say?  I'm
curious about the code for the body style etc?   I saw a 21 window with the
skylights bondoed over - the owner said they leaked and were just a hassle.
