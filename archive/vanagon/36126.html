Subject: NEATO Website looking good...

Dave Easterwood sent me the web access for the NEATO site still being
constructed so I could have a sneak preview...news is its looking awesome
folks! Sort of like a mix between info and and electronic ever updating
mag...I especially liked the backgrounds...makes me jealous :) :)
as the proverbial goes &quot;watch this space&quot; (or should it be &quot;that space&quot;?)
