I'm curious if anyone else has problems getting &quot;air pockets&quot; out of Vanagon
cooling systems. I raised the front end the required number of inches, and
went through all the gyrations the work manual recommends......but bubbles
come out the top bleeder of the radiator, then stop, then a while later come
out, then stop on and off. I never feel I have gotten them out, no matter
what.

Then when driving, all seems OK, then sometimes I find the overflow tank
empty, so I add some 50:50 Autobahn/water to the hot line, then later, it's
too full?? Then later empty again???? I'm not losing water on the ground, and
I don't notice any smoking to indicate any cylinder head problems. And yes I
opened the heater valve and turned the heat all the way up as recommended.

Any ideas?
