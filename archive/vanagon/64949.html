&gt; I recently purchased a Turbo Muffler from S &amp; S (602-847-9000).

&gt; S&amp;S manufacturers a top quality Turbo Muffler and tail pipe

&gt; for Vanagons.  I put one on my 1984 H20Boxer and, while slightly more
&gt; noise, gas milage improved by at least 1.5mpgh.  Better yet, the total
&gt;
&gt; cost is less than the replacement anywhere!!
&gt;
&gt; They also make headers that are high quality and reasonably priced,
&gt; much
&gt; cheaper than replacing all of the broken Volks header pipes.  Allows

&gt; If you call mention Davidb and you'll get a discount.

Any idea if their headers will fit a Syncro?
