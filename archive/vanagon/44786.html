Subject: Re: cb channel question

Channel 19 is universal for truckers and anyone else using the CB for road
info.  My experience shows that to be true west of the rockies as well.  I
drive to CO and back twice a year.  Channel 9 is the emergency channel and
only to be used to report emergencies and for help.

&gt;Those of you with cb's, what
&gt;generally are good channels to listen to as far as truckers, etc.
