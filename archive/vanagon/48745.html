Subject: Getting bubbles out of cooling system

About a month, someone left an excellent, specific procedure to get the
bubbles out of Vanagon water-cooled systems. Unforturnately, I have misplaced
them.

I have an '84 Camper, and when I have gone through the official owner's
manual by lifting the front end up, etc, I still have air in the system. It
appeared that bubbles would come out of the radiator bleeder for s short
time, then totally stop doing anything, then occasionally bubble up, then
stop, etc. It seemed erratic and unproductive, with then end result of about
a 1.5 inch bubble in the master tank by the engine.

Does anyone have a specific way to purge this darned system?
