I'd stay away from the copper lines due to the softness of the material.  
See if you can trade it for some stainless steel, it stands up better to 
rocks thrown up from the roadway.



The only problem ive seen with the metal brake lines is junk being stuck in
them, especially if the bus sat for ages.  Well,  they've been twisted when
someone carelessly took off the rubber line..  The bus came with copper
tubing,  it works fine..   Steel would be harder to shape into the
appropriate curve.   I have a source for OEM metal (yes, copper) lines for
about $5 each.

my two cents
