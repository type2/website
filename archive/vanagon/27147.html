Subject: A different height question
From: Peter&amp;Varshna &lt;ztgst_at_eden_dot_com&gt;


Citizens:

While goofing around in my '77 Westfalia project, my wife sat in the 
driver seat and noticed that she had a very hard time reaching the pedals 
without sitting on the edge of the seat uncomfortably.  You see, my wife 
is pretty short.  About 4'9&quot; barefoot.

To be honest, it's kinda hard to really judge how well she'll fit into 
the driver seat once the bus is on the road since right now she is quite 
pregnant.  Still, with the rather flat attitude of the steering wheel, 
I'm afraid I may need to modify the seat to get her close enough to the 
pedals without putting on some smaller (and harder to turn) aftermarket 
steering wheel.  I've got the later model loaf seats with the headrests.

So, are there any smaller bus folk (or anyone who knows any smaller bus 
folk) who could share their experiences/ideas?  As far as any 
modification suggestions go, I'm no lumberjack at 5'7&quot; so I could 
probably make it work.  I hope.

Much Thanks,

Peter.
