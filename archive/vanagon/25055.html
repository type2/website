Subject: Interbike '95 &amp; Bergs shop

Ladies &amp; Gentlemen,

Though this is not directly VW related, but I thought I would post the
results of my survey of Interbike '95's bike carriers.  Plus, I visited Gene
Bergs shop and got a tour.

First, the bike carriers.  I may have missed some, but I found no less then
16 manufacturers of bike carriers. I didn't bother describing all the
configurations, much less the addresses and phone numbers of each company.
I figured if you were interested you could do additional research.

Hollywood, receiver and rear mounts

BackPacker, receiver mount

Draftmaster, designed for vans so the bikes mount vertically on the back, I
think they were receivers.  Also used by racers because of the ease of
getting to the bike on the run.  I saw a tandem mount also.

Rhode Gear, Bumper/license plate and receiver mounts

Sport

RoofRax

AutoMaxi, roof mounts

Cycle Transfer (by Advent/Service Cycle) looks like a copy of others under a
different name.

Allen

OSI

BDI, rear mount on license plate/bumper

RedRock, Swagman and Rak-N-Lok lines, both receiver and ball hitch mounts.
Rak-N-Lok line uses a gas shock system to help lifting the rack away for
rear mount access.  They also have one that uses the spare tire mount.

Freidl

Zap

Grabber, bumper/license plate, receiver and ball hitch mounts.  This model
was diplayed by alot of distributors.

Bard-Wyers

Now I'm sorry I didn't do a more complete survey, but it was too much.  Most
of these are van mount type systems and alot of regular roof carriers were
not represented, such as Yakima.

Other cool things at the Bike show were several folding, or breakaway bikes
(that reduce the need for a rack).  The Moulton was fabulous, though
expensive. Also the Bike Friday, Dahon, Montague, Salsa breakaway.  Santana
also had a breakaway tandem displayed.

For those with less leg power there were a few power assists available, the
Chronos Hammer electric assist, the Edge gasoline assist (very fast and
noisy), the BAT electric bike, a Japanese designed rear hub electric that
was the second loneliest booth (BLM was the loneliest), and the ZAP electric
assist that was displayed on a police bike.  I'm dreaming of a Moulton with
a pair of Chronos Hammers.

While in Anaheim I dropped off my crank for Berg to polish, then returned a
day later to pick it up and go for a tour.  I met Clyde and Gary Berg as
well as Tim Walker who led the tour.  Looked at all the heavy machinery
lying around under blankets to keep them clean.  Saw the dyno/test stand
with dozens of sensors on a drag engine with 52 mm carbs.  Apparently fuel
injection was disallowed for VW drag races and they have had to return to
carbs.  Walked through the new building where they will eventually expand so
that each machine has it's own clean room, as well as an engine assembly
clean room.  Shelves upon shelves of raw, un-machined parts.  Several of
Gene's vanagon engines lying around.  Also Clydes drag car which will be run
in Phoenix.  Offered up a couple home brew pints to Clyde and Gary.  I also
took the liberty of wishing Gene the best from the Vanagon list.  He and his
shop are a museum and archive of VW knowledge that I, personally, rever.  He
is undergoing therapy and is still having difficulty speaking, though the
hopes are for a 95% recovery.

Eug,
'71
