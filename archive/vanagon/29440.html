Subject: great quote about VW's


Some of you from this list (Ron?) know me as a Northern Exposure fanatic.  On
today's episode they had a wonderful quote, which, because of its VW content,
I'll share with all of you.  The topic was bowling, and all spoken by Dr.
Phillip Kapra.

I can't remember the exact words, but it went something like this.

&quot;You can never get rid of bowling shoes.  They are like VW's; they don't
die, they just get 'recycled.'  Pretty soon they get fungus and begin to
rot.&quot;
