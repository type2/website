Yo Dudes! Authentic German on the line. 

 I sent a classified ad somewhere into Germany and this is the first I've
heard of it. I think I sent it to Bulli Cartel (spelling?), which is some
kind of Germany VW bus mag. 

I cannot remember why he is writing to me but perhaps I didn't put in the
information about how to subscribe, or perhaps he is new to email and
doesn't understand the instructions.

Anyway, Joel or Gerry, can you sign 'em up?

(I don't know why, but I seem to be determined to get the Germans onto our
list.)

Derek
