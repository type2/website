&gt;When I flew down to San Jose to pick the Convertible Ghia I bought, I
&gt;drove over the Golden Gate and didn't have to pay.  It was a Saturday.
&gt;This is weekday only thing?

In one direction, you pay. The other way is a freebie.


&gt;BTW, it was a gorgeous, warm, clear day with the top down and the bridge
                         ^^^^
VERY unusual for San Francisco!

&quot;The coldest winter I ever spent, was a summer in San Francisco.&quot; -anon.
