Subject: Re: '71 Idle fixed/still wondering about AD Engine

In a message dated 95-07-13 17:41:58 EDT, you write:

&gt;I still don't know about the AD stamp on my 1600 engine, but in the words
&gt;of Drew Bybee, &quot;Patience is a virtue and a virtue can't hurt-you.&quot; (You've
&gt;got to say it for the poetics to do their justice.)

AD Series Engines were produced from August 1970 (71 Model year) on for the
home (European) market without all those wonderful emission control goodies.
 Essentially a 1600 without smog junk.

Reference:  Volkswagen Production Survey taken from Microfiche  -

AD 000001 thru AD 0350045 - 1971
AD 0350046 thru AD 0612163 -1972
AD 0613001 thru AD 0990000 - 1973

dunno what happened to AD 0612164 thru AD 0612999 - the survey doesn't say

from '74 on to 1979, they were supered by the AF and AS Series of 1600's

Keep 'em runnin' :)
