Subject: Re: blow-by to the limit ... what limits?

&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone here actually gone ahead and ignored the wicked blow-by and
&gt; kept adding oil to their diesels?  What is the eventual outcome of
&gt; blow-by?  At what point will the vanagon engine absolutely have to be 
&gt; rebuilt?  You might wonder why I'd ask such questions.  Well I would
&gt; almost swear that my blow-by pressure actually turns my oil filler cap.

Blow-by consequences the *I* know of (and there are surely more)

1) The seals may not hold...and the VW will leave its mark
  on your driveway. Eventually you get real sick of watching
  new oil fall on the ground. Benefit: No more nasty oil chnages
  ever required.

2) The PCV system will blow oil into your air filter, which will
  then get sucked into the air intake system for combustion. It
   is posible that this oil will then burn in the cylinder, 
  causing uncontrollable engine RPM. You can't turn it off because
  there are no sparkplugs, and it ain't coming from the injectors, so
  removing your foot from the accelrator won't help.


3) The back window will be always full of oil-spots. YECH

You can always wait like I did..till the engine says goodbye.

btw: My valves were bent, so Valve Job is required on NuBus.  grr.
