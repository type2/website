&gt; Hello from frozen Montana,
&gt; 
&gt; I purchased an Olympian 6100a catalytic heater yesterday.  I installed it in
&gt; my Westy, but I'm dissatisfied with it's performance.

Hi Mark,

	In Montana, 5800 BTUs is probably not enough heat.  I have an 
Olympian 3100, 2800 BTU/hr in my '82 Westy, and the climate in Oregon's 
milder.  In the coldest weather, all I expect the heater to do is to 
keep the chill off the interior.   As a rule the vans are poorly 
insulated from the cold.  Lots of window glass and such.  If you're 
still disatisified with your Olympian, I'd be willing to purchase it 
from you.  Think of 5800 BTUs as one and a half standard home space 
heaters.  In montana, you're still cold!  Good Luck

Bill
