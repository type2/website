&gt; &gt; Since this is my first winter with my Vanagon, I would like to know
&gt; &gt; what to expect as far as traction and the like when it starts to
&gt; &gt; snow.  I will buy some snow tires, so can I get away with only two
&gt; &gt; rears, or do I need all four tires to be stable?  I have been told
&gt; &gt; that the Vanagons are actually quite good in the snow.  Your
&gt; &gt; opinions?
&gt; 
&gt; Until I put Verdenstein studded snows on the back and pumped them up to 
&gt; 55 psi, I didn't think it did very well at all.  Now I'm a believer.
&gt; 
Well having some real experience here, IE rolling the '86 2.5 times on
its side in the snow back in '91 I'll make a few comments.  The VW
transporter is an exceptional vehicle on snow, even with normal tires
like factory supplied Conti or XZX's but only with chains on the back.
With a good M+S and chains on the rear all tires inflated at least 3psi
high like the book says, unstoppable.  Conversely, when you forget your
chains, and unexpectedly drive into an early snow that has dumped 4
inches in 45 minutes, freezing the water on the roads to glare ice, and
further pick the exact moment to finally get off the road and slow down
corresponding to an interstate grade cooled by prevailing winds known
for its treacherous winter conditions.  DO NOT LET OFF THE THROTTLE
ABRUPTLY.  BUSES LIKE EARLY 930's (there is a comparison you won't see
everyday) are subject to viscious trailing throttle oversteer on reduced
traction surfaces, particularly when turning.  Still an out of control
Bus or Van spinning on ice is usually stable and recoverable, unless to
your further horror a rear tire happens to catch on a drain.  Oh well I
still say they are a fine fine winter vehicle, buy chains everyone, and
keep em in the Bus.
