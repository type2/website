Hi,

	Well, yesterday (Saturday) I got the sunroof put in.  It really
wasn't too difficult except that some of the fasteners I bought were too
short even though they were the exact length as the old ones, specifically
the ones that hold the cover to the bows.

	One major problem, tho, is that there is stil about a 1/3&quot; gap in
some places along the sides, and I can see a wind/rain problem there.
Has anybody else had this problem?

	BTW - Joel - please go ahead and send the instructions; It'll still
be helpful to know if I did it right or if I missed anything!

Thanks
Thom
