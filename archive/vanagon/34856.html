I paid $3,000 CDN for our '76 Westy a year and a half ago.  Rust where 
you describe, plus really rusted battery tray, shot front seat padding, 
cracked CV joint boots, needed to replace one CVJ, needed some exhaust 
work, rusted out heater boxes, sink pump inoperable, surface rust on 
front end and rusted under winshield.  Sliding door a problem, rockers 
rusted.  

But it spoke to us.  It said, &quot;Take me home and I won't let you down.&quot;

We listened.  It was right--15,000 miles around North America and nary a 
burp.  We take it camping nearly every weekend in summer.  And we'll 
drive it to the Arctic Ocean next summer.

We'll fix it up over the years, as we have so far.

Ours was about average condition for the price in our area (Vancouver).  
Get it checked out, but if it's as you say, the price seems alright.

Listen to hear what it's telling you.

Tobin
