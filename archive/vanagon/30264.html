Subject: hmm, i'm back/NYE trip?

hey now,

well, i thought this list had either dropped me or crashed...but seems i was
banned because i unknowingly violated the policy of posting about {censored}
and {censored}. i apologize to the owner of the list...i had no idea that
{censored} talk had been forbidden.let me say i've missed getting posts
greatly and was really scared that everyone had sold their vws or something.


anyway, before i was taken off the list, i had posted something about a New
Year's Eve trip down to the keys. don't think this made it out to anyone. would
anyone be interested? let me know....i was thinking about dec 27- jan 3. maybe
take the back roads down to florida....think warmth!
