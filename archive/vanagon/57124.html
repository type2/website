&lt;&lt;...What is the professional opinion on gas grade.  My manual (88

used nothing but premium.  Can I bump it down safely??...&gt;&gt;

   Thad,  87 octane has worked well for me in 52,000 miles of driving an
'89 Westy through 40 states.  Of course that's just my opinion; I could
be wrong.  (apologies to Dennis Miller)
