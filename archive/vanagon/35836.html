Subject: RE:  how to move a vehicle 400+ miles?


     Michael,

     I recently bought a DOA Syncro 600 miles away. I checked out the
     prices of renting a suitable trailer, driving there, driving back,
     towing with my non-vanagon car etc. Seemed with tolls, gas, trailer
     rental,etc, it was a $250 proposition, plus two days of my life.

     Before leaving, just to make certain I was on the right track, I
     bought a copy of Hemmings Motor News. Under the services heading, I
     found and called ten car delivery services ( most had 800 numbers) and
     got bids. The prices are a little variable, depends on where your
     vehicle is, where it is going, and what jobs the delivery person
     already has. I found one guy who would be passing through with a two
     car trailer carrying only one car, and we settled on $300. The syncro
     was sitting in my driveway before I could have LEFT to pick it up
     myself.

     Your situation may be different, but think about checking it out....
     Good luck,

     Tom F.
