Subject: Rebuilding Heads?

Hello all. Jiust found out about this group, and hope you can help.
I have an '81 Vanagon air-cooled with a 2000cc engine. She has 
143,000 miles on it and is in need of an engine rebuild. Does anyone
know who still rebuilds VW (411) heads? As far as I know of, no one
in the Cleveland area does this anymore. 
Lisa
