 &gt;&gt; Where was this weep hole? I crawled under with a minimag and looked about
 but I didn't see much in the way of the water pump, just the pulley and the ac
condenser.&lt;&lt;

 When I finally spotted it, my forehead was on the bumper, the halogen light
was beaming from below and my line of sight was through a small square formed
by a muffler component and other pieces.  Really, it took a while to find it. 
Find the pulley and try to follow the shaft back to the waterpump housing.  
If you've got long fingers, you may be able to feel it first.

 &gt;&gt; I have some coolant on top of my left head and cannot for the life of me,
figure out where is came/is coming from... &lt;&lt;

 It *could* be slinging fluid and settling on the head, but I'm no expert. 
Look on the underside of the engine cover, is it wet?
