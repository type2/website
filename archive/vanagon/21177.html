&gt;Can anyone suggest where I might look for tent/awning grade canvas?

also check the yellow pages for Fabric Finishers ... these are the guys who
make the raw stuff to sell to the folks who make the tents, sails, and such.
you can buy &quot;ends&quot; of the production runs ... which may have small flaws
in places ... by the pound! cheap! :)

and what about folks that make hot air balloons??
