$33.33 Did the trick !  (Dealer with 3's on his mind)

Now the radiator fan comes on at slow speed immediately the aircon is
switched on, so now I HAVE to use aircon all the time as i'm waiting on a fan
switch for radiator so that the slow speed fan comes on during normal
Operating conditions - currently it only comes on HIGH when engine gets
HOTTT.

I can think of worse problems given this beast lives with me in New Orleans.
