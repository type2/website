Subject: Re: 6v fuel guage in 12v bus

&gt;&gt; Fuel guage:  I don't really know how these things work, please advise.
&gt;&gt; If I get a voltage drop, does it power the sender, the guage, or both?

&gt;I think it works on resistance, I still have a 6V gauge running off of
&gt;12V, and it reads fine.  But I've heard other people complain about
thiers.    


My '63 bus has been converted to 12v, but the fuel guage reads max all the
time (except when engine is off when it reads 0)
A friend of mine has a 12v fuel guage out of a '67 (I like this friend
alot :))
Will swapping them over solve the prob? I'm confused that your 6v guage works
fine. Is there a sinister problem lurking in the elec connection to my 
guage?

Sarah.
