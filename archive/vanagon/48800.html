&gt;&gt;Help!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Has anyone removed the front heater blower motor.
&gt;
&gt;I exchanged one from an aircooled version into a
&gt;watercooled version. 8 hours reassembling, 8 hours
&gt;assembling the whole dashboard/heater.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have
&gt;&gt;managed to loosen the screws that secure the unit.  It
&gt;&gt;appears that the cooling hoses must be disconnected as
&gt;&gt;well the as the upper dash panel before the assembly can
&gt;&gt;be removed and disassembled to remove the blower motor.
&gt;&gt;Can anyone confirm this?
&gt;
&gt;First remove the dashboard, disconnect the cooling hoses
&gt;from the heater and remove the whole heaterbox.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Also, does the steering column
&gt;&gt;need to be disconnected to raise the dash up enough to
&gt;&gt;slide out the assembly?
&gt;
&gt;I had no tools to remove the two screws connecting
&gt;the steering column with the dashboard. I disassembled
&gt;the steering column near the pedals and the steering
&gt;column support near the windshield (two screws under! the
&gt;dashboard).
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Would appreciate any advice and assistance.  I looked for
&gt;&gt;advice in the archives, but could not find anything.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks,
&gt;

I use vice grips to pull those 2 steeing column &quot;special&quot; bolts.
I lay back the whole dash, (with the glove box, inst panel, heater controls,
etc, taken out)
I disconnect the heater blower assy, (mark the cable hookup spots) and slide
it out. (Leave the hoses attached)
Bust loose those plastic welds,(split them at the seam), pull the screws and
seperate the blower box.
Pull the blower motor out.
I keep the dash supported with a 2x4, and don't for get the special clips
for the blower box plastic welds you had to split
What a pain, hpoe you don't get good at it.
