Subject: Re: The Adventure of the Thrown Rod

tun the motor over by hand and listen carefully for a thunk noise.   if you
hear it, do not drive anymore.    it is easier and cheaper to rebuild
*before* the rod goes through the case.    

drain your oil and check for metal shavings?   is the plate clean?


good luck, and may St. Pon smile on you   :)
