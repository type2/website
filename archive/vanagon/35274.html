&gt; For anyone who hasn't dealt with uuencoded binary files, the pages that 
&gt; look like gibberish is actually a binary file encoded to allow sending 
&gt; via e-mail.  If you run it through a decoder (like Wincode) you will get 
&gt; a nice clear image.  Hope this didn't cause you all any probs.  

... and I hope the list admin doesn't mind me jumping in here and
reminding everyone to NOT to post these encoded files to the list.  They
tend to be quite large (as you may have noticed) and they clutter up the
archive.  These kinds of files are better distributed through a
newsgroup.

Thanks,
