Subject: Re: A '59 bus found

&quot;BTW:The engine is commonly referred to as a &quot;36hp&quot; engine possibly what was
considered the &quot;bastard&quot; engine. I think '59 was the year for this engine. I
was the short lived transitional engine between the 36hp and the 40hp
engines.&quot;
--------

the bastard 40 HP motor was used from 19 May 1959 (chassis # 469 447) until 1
June 1960 (chassis # 614 456) It has the bolt on generator stand, like the
later upright motors .

the likelihood of finding one of these motors is pretty slim as they tended
to self destruct quite quickly- which is why they were discontinued in just
over a year.   i think VW replaced the motor free of charge as they were so
embarassed. 

I have only seen one, which is now sitting in my garage.  It was in a friends
52 single cab when he got it, and the motor still turns round.    I was
convinced intohauling the ^%# thing all the way back from Alberta

BTW, the 52 truck is ye classicke storie of finding an old vw in a farmers
field.   It is said to be the 4th oldest truck, and the guy who has it now
restores horse drawn buggies, so the truck doesnt seem that old to him, and
hopefully it will be fixed up soon.  :)
