Subject: VW of A alleged lawsuit

Regarding that WWW-related lawsuit, it was hard to believe that VW could
be *that* stupid.  And apparently they're not.

&gt; OK, here it is from the horse's mouth.
&gt; It sounds like we over reacted to the comments posted initially on
&gt; the UofM's website.
&gt; VW's objections apparently stemmed from the &quot;girly&quot; picture with the
&gt; VW logo placed (without permission) at a &quot;strategic&quot; location. 
&gt; I guess they have a point...
&gt; 
&gt; This was a good learning lesson:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Unless you know the facts, don't judge. The information was only
&gt;    hearsay.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) We have to be aware of copyright and trademark infringements.
&gt;    Internet is not the secret little underground club shared by academics
&gt;    and some organizations as it used to be.
&gt;    Publishing anything on the net is similar to publishing 
&gt;    on traditional non-volatile storage media (paper).
&gt;    In our picture gallery, we need to make an attempt to: 
&gt; 
&gt;    a) identify the origin of the pic and give due credit
&gt;    b) ask permission to publish if for non-profit reasons
&gt;    c) share profits and get permission if anything will be used for profit
&gt; 
&gt; 3) The internet and this group is a wonderfully supportive club. Thanks
&gt;    to all of you.

&gt; Here's the reply I got. I'll be reopening the sites soon, after reviewing
&gt; for questionable data.

&gt; &gt; Jan,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The facts are:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1. It is not now and never has been our intention to close any website or, 
&gt; &gt; specifically, the website at the University of Manitoba.
&gt; &gt; 2. We are neither suing or censoring anyone in this matter.
&gt; &gt; 3. It is our desire to protect our trademark and to ensure that it is
properly 
&gt; &gt; and tastefully used. This was not the case in this instance and we were 
&gt; &gt; attempting to correct this matter.
&gt; &gt; 4. Volkswagen does not charge people to view information on its website.
&gt; &gt; 5. We look forward to working with anyone interested in developing
their own 
&gt; &gt; Volkswagen Internet application, provided that our trademark is used
correctly.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The site in question presented the VW logo not only without permission
but in a 
&gt; &gt; way which was patently offensive -- as a cover to the private parts of
a nude 
&gt; &gt; woman.  At best this is in extremely poor taste; at worst it is
offensive to 
&gt; &gt; our current and future female customers.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thank you for your interest in the situation.
