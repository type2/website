Subject: 87' Westy fs

It's got to go!   I've got 1 too many Westies!   In West Tennessee.. 1987 VW
Vanagon GL, Westy pop-top.  Auto trans, pwr steer, brakes, windows &amp; locks..
AM/FM/CD Player Air cond. .   100 k miles... Grey with grey plaid interior
and grey pop top.  New tires,  brakes, and battery..  Runs like a top.  No
leaks, no rust. Body is in super shape except for 1 minor dented area (5 sq
inches touched up) in rear driver's wheel well panel. All camper stuff, ie;
stove, sink,  fridge, pop-top, beds, etc. in great shape.. very clean with
little useage showing..  I've fixed up  some minor stuff, including pop-top
and luggage rack seals, had 2 holes in tent professionally repaired by tent
mfr,  cleaned and tuned engine  etc.  It's a hobby for me, but I need space
now for 2 canoes instead!.. $9950.00  firm!  if this doesn't do it, the kids
can call it the new city park!.......Call Ron (901)754-5812, or e-mail me at
