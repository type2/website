Subject: Re: List Sticker Update

In a message dated 96-02-05 12:44:31 EST, you write:

&gt;  Also, for those of you who haven't ordered, there are PLENTY left. Only
&gt;about
&gt;50 people have ordered, which is less than 10% of the list membership. So,
if
&gt;you haven't ordered yours yet, PLEASE do. I really don't need 300+ stickers
&gt;for
&gt;myself. (For more info, see my next post.)

Allright, I've decieded I need a few (5) of these!  I'll put my check (&amp;
SASE) in the mail this week.  I will gladly take the other 295 off your hands
just as soon as I buy 299 more vw's!

BTW, All you Virginia volks should get one of these,too.  Otherwise, I'll be
the only one in Virginia with one!  Everyone will know who I am, but I won't
know you.  And, hey, what if one of those misguided west coasters comes this
way in search of friendly vw enthusists and sees no stickers.  They'll
probably turn around and head home thinking nobody loves vw's here.  (Except
for Martha, she'll probably just push a magic James Bond button, turn her bus
into a boat or sub or something, and just keep on going across the Atlantic).
