&gt;        Alrighty then, I have now expanded my knowledge to include the in
&gt;and outs of these little critters. Dad took me out and showed me whats
&gt;what, but now I just need to know one thing, where do I get them. Is this
&gt;one of those things that I can get at Canadian Tire or any store or am I
&gt;going to have to order them from a VW dealer?

One tip: Only use Bosch, really, others have tested the cheaper alternatives
allready, you don't have to :)

Bosch 1 235 522 193 Distributor cap (or 1 235 522 056 this one is often the
                    common replacement the FLAPS will have in stock).
