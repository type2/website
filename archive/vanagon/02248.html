Subject: Da trip, NY leg


(is there another place to send this stuff other than the list yet?)

Things to do,see,scratch,sniff in NY

NYC ( i know its on the list, but dump your car and public transport in)
	Park in one of the malls on Staten Island, run our own personal
shuttles to the Ferry, 50 cents gives you a 20 minute boat ride 
(round trip - the best deal in NYC!) to lower Manhattan. Trains take 
you the rest of the way on the island. Reality check - do not ride trains
alone at night (after working hours). Ferry terminal on SI not nice at night
either but there are safe places to wait for a ride.

Decision time
	9W up scenic Hudson River Valley to Capital District (156 miles)
probably want to do an overnight excursion in Catskills area

				or

(a longer leg) Route 17 all the way up to my present location, the
Finger Lakes Region. Gorges, hiking trails for all legs/lungs, Wine tasting
trails (12 or so stops), State Parks and more. About 4 hours from NYC.

Either way, another 150 miles takes you up to the top of the state to
the Canadian border on your way to Montreal, Ottawa, i recommend 
Algonquin Provincial Pk (although havent been there in a long time - will
check on this) down to Toronto, Niagara Falls (my hometown!!) across to
Motown and ??????
