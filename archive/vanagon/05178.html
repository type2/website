&gt; Who's gonna be there, and what'll you be driving? I'll be driving my 
&gt; semi-roadworthy (cross your fingers!) `66 westywidget (bubble top. The
&gt; Oddest Camper-Looking Thing In Washington. It looks like a giant ice-cream
&gt; cone from the rear.) Hope it makes it! I'll be the short, fat swarthy
&gt; Italian guy in the obnoxious purple shirt! C'mon, there's 17(?) of us 
&gt; here in WA, Let's all get together, drink too much beer, and piss
&gt; off our SO's so we get to sleep in our busses! :)
&gt; 
&gt; 
Oh Geez, how do I get myself into these things....

Maybe.  When?  (BTW it'll have to be GOOD beer, none of that industrial 
swill, thank you, and I assume we'll have to bring our own.  Last time 
(about 15 years ago) I &quot;did the Puyallup&quot; the damm thing was totally 
DRY!  Some county fair!!
