&gt;Later, with a more modern engine (74?) removal and reinstallation took a
&gt;bit more time (another hour maybe?) and I used up a good friend and
&gt;could've used another. But it got done.   :-)  I probably shoulda left the
&gt;engine attached to the transaxle or something.

I find the fastest way to remove a Type 4 is the take off the schroud and
then pull the engine, leaving the trainey.
