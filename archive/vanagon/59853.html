Any of you air cooled chaps out there would do very well to heed the words of
Mr.Ark Mirvis (Automotive Heating Technologies).  This man is sharp and
quick.  I consider him to be the formost authority on gas heaters.  I have
dealt with him a couple of times over the past few years, and found him to be
fair, honest and astute.
Just don't get him going &quot;Tigers vs T-34's&quot;

Did anyone else see this post to the air cooled for sale list?

&gt; 
&gt; Hello, fellows,
&gt; 
&gt; Here is my first message to you and, when I speak, please, listen.
&gt; 
&gt; Many of you know too well what freezing in your bus feels like. When I
offered and not 
&gt; once to my shivering customers hot tea or coffee, it was seen by them as
the best 
&gt; care and experience! Do good people have to be miserable?
&gt; 
&gt; Remember &quot;necessity is mother of invention&quot;? When, more than thirty years
ago, I 
&gt; couldn't take freezing at - 40F anymore, a series of experiments began.  
&gt; 
&gt; Do you think there is a very big difference between -15 and -40F when it
comes to 
&gt; driving? Not really! Simply put: driving without heat is dangerous,
particularly on 
&gt; long and deserted roads.
&gt; 
&gt; Simple thinking and not much knowledge was needed to investigate sources
of energy for 
&gt; heating and these were found inpractical:
&gt; 
&gt; LIQUID GAS OR PROPANE. Why? Gas has low energy content, evaporation stops
at low 
&gt; temperature, special tank or bottle carrier needed, pressure regulators
do not 
&gt; do the job and freeze, piping has to be very well done, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; ELECTRIC POWER. Where is it? To warm the bus (no holes, no air leaks, no
draft!) you 
&gt; need minimum 18 - 20000 BTU/HR. This translates to approx. 5.3 - 5.8
KW/HR. We all 
&gt; have on board 12 volts source. For this source to develop 5.3 - 5.8
kilowatts it must 
&gt; output 441 - 483 amperes! Have you seen welders trucks, their generators
and cables, 
&gt; did you? Would you want to have all this just to have sufficient electric
heating on 
&gt; board? 
&gt; You can see ads (even in national publications), luring you into buying
an electric 
&gt; heater for the bus. This is nonsense! 
&gt; 
&gt; Till portable nuclear source will be developed, electricity for heating
is out.
&gt; 
&gt; ENGINE EXHAUST AND OIL. Even Volkswagen realized that these were poor
sources of heat, 
&gt; and it started to offer auxiliary gasoline burning heaters of minimum
capacity.
&gt; I have seen many attempts to get or improve heating without result.
Additional 
&gt; blowers, heatexchangers - what we try? To get heat from where it is not
in the first 
&gt; place!
&gt; 
&gt; A sure way to finish your engine is to suck heat from oil. Oil to flow
and lubricate, 
&gt; MUST to be warm. Cold oil sludges the engine when blow-by is high and
detergents do 
&gt; not work well.
&gt; 
&gt; WOOD AND COAL. Believe me I have seen good workmanship in implementing
this idea. 
&gt; NICE! Fireplace in the bus! And a chimney with a ruster on it. Sure way
to arouse ann 
&gt; attention of the highway patrol and onlookers. And you have ashes on
board to spread 
&gt; under wheel if you stuck! How about pulling a trailer with wood or coal,
like steam 
&gt; engines were doing?
&gt; 
&gt; ALCOHOL. This is taken inside for warming up. But drinking and driving do
not mix! 
&gt; Don't even try! There is statistic that 10,000 Russians die every year
freezing after 
&gt; vodka intake.
&gt; 
&gt; WARM CLOTHES. Good idea! But how much of it can you put on? Till you will
not be able 
&gt; to move. Even with warm socks you need to do SCHUHEPLATTER (german dance)
to keep your 
&gt; toes alive.
&gt; 
&gt; POLAR SLEEPING BAG, ADOPTED FOR DRIVING. Great! Anyone knows where they
are sold?
&gt; 
&gt; So, where to go for real heat? It is not far away - right in your gas
tank! That is 
&gt; THE ULTIMATE SOURCE OF ENERGY for THE ULTIMATE WAY TO BEAT THE COLD -
COMBUSTION 
&gt; HEATERS! 
&gt; 
&gt; Small,powerfull, efficient, nature friendly (very low emission level
because of 
&gt; abundance of air and low combustion temperatures), quiet, reliable and
SAFE.
&gt; Yes, safer than your house oil burner! 
&gt; 
&gt; Safe only after service by a specialist. Why so many stories about
&quot;heater inherent 
&gt; dangerous nature&quot; ? That a whole separate article can and was written by
me.
&gt; 
&gt; Believe me, the heater is dangerous because little knowledge is
dangerous. 
&gt; When I service or sell a heater a set of of instructions goes with it.
When these 
&gt; instructions are followed, you are safe, totally. 
&gt; 
&gt; Heater is dangerous when bought uncomplete and not adjusted. This is how
most of 
&gt; heaters are sold at shows and by friends. Do yourself and your loved ones
a favor, ask 
&gt; and do not rush to follow advices of the seller.
&gt;   
&gt; Years of heater service, restorations resulted in many modification
technics, trade 
&gt; secrets and approaches to make heater to start and to run better than
when it left the 
&gt; assembly line.   
&gt;  
&gt; Do not waste time! Electric car engineers selected combustion heaters.
&gt; 
&gt; How about watercooled cars, buses? Particularly those with diesels?
Preheat the engine 
&gt; and the interior! We have these engineering wanders! Miniature heat
gigants, weighing 
&gt; barely 10 pounds, you can find space to put under the hood in any car.
Completely 
&gt; autonomous.
&gt; 
&gt; What else do you want to know? Get in touch. 
&gt; Enjoy warm driving!
