Subject: Electric VW Information Resource

Greetings:

Interest has been expressed from time to time about electric 
vehicle conversions.  Reading my April/May 1996 copy of Home 
Power, I enjoyed an article about a 'VoltsRabbit' 
conversion.  For any other V_at_L readers who may be 
interested, here is the address for Home Power.

There is also an article about using EDTA Tetrasodium to 
rejuvenate lead-acid batteries.  This may be of interest to 
camper owners with sulfated deep-cycle batteries.


Usual disclaimers....
