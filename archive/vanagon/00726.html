Subject: smashed wheel well

I smashed my wheelwell extension so I pounded it out with hammers for a few
hours and then repainted it with factory paint I sprayed on with hardware
store do-it-yourself spay bottles with air pressure extensions. Then, to top
the amatuer job off I put a black wheelwell molding strip (about 1/4 inch
wide) around the very outside edge of the extension. The job looks 1/2 ok.

I added a 2nd antenna on the right side in the same location as the antenna
on the left side except this second antenna is for the CB/Ham radio. Before
putting this 2nd antenna in, I had it modified so that it would be optimized
for CB/Ham frequencies at a spy shop. It doesn't advertise the presence of a
CB at all because it is a factory antenna.
