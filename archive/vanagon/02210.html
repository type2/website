Subject: Re: The big &quot;S&quot;

There seems to be a sizable population in the MD, DC, VA area. We'd (I'd) 
like to see the tour come this way.

Of course we do have ample camping and lodging facilities, things to do,
things to see and things to eat in NATION's CAPITOL that may entice a
visitor or two.

  Quality is no guarantee of success, to do nothing is to guarantee failure!
