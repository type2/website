Hmm.. well, do you live in an area that is required to have oxygenated 
gasoline for the winter months?  I found that I get 4ish mpg less than 
regular gasoline with the stuff.  If so, that could be the cause.  Does 
your gas station sell an ethanol/whatever mix?   Did you switch gas stations?

Just random thoughts as I go through the 475 messages in my box.  I love 
this list. :)
