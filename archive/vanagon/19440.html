Subject: Re: rec.autos.vw call for votes

Joel opined:

&gt;regrettably, i don't get rec.autos.vw with any consistency, so i'm kinda of
&gt;the optinion that maybe i shouldn't voice a vote on this. THIS list is more
&gt;than enough for me (with a few side-trips to snoop around other vw-related

My browsing in there has been thin also, but every time the bus related 
questions were a small minority. Wasserboxer questions were almost 
non-existant. Splitting rec.autos.vw means little to me, I'd still browse 
both. I vote not to vote, how about that for apathy, Canadian eh. About the 
only suggestion I have is that once every week or so someone (Gerry?) sends 
the vanagon list address to rec.autos.vw.h20 /.ac to enable people to find 
us.   tim s.
