&lt;&lt; I HAD A SIMILAR PROBLEM WITH  MY 83 WESTY . IT ENDED UP BEING A 2 PART
 PROBLEM. FIRST THE PROBLEM WITH RIDING AND JUST  GOING DEAD WAS THE CYLINDER
 THAT THE KEY GOES INTO IN THE IGNITION LOCK. MY MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT THEY
 GO BAD IF YOU PUT A LOAD OF KEYS ON THE KEY RING THE WEIGHT SWINGING SCREWS
 THINGS UP. WHICH EXPLAINS THE INTERMITTANT PROBLEM OF IT HAPPENING FOR NO
 APPARENT REASON.  SO NOW I ALWAYS JUST KEEP MY IGNITION KEY BY IT SELF OR
 WITH THE GAS KEY ONLY. THE PROBLEM WITH HAVING TROUBLE GETTING STARTED AFTER
 SHE'S HOT FOR ME WAS A PROBLEM WITH AN AFTERMARKET CRUISE CONTROL, INSTALLED
 BY A PREVIOUS OWNER, THAT I PROMPTLY RIPPED OUT. IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE OF
 THESE THE PROBLEM MAY BE VACUUM RELATED. JUST A GUESS.
 THAT THESE 2 THINGS HAPPENED TO ME AT THE SAME TIME AND ARE VERY SIMILAR TO
 YOUR PROBLEMS MAY JUST BE A FLUKE BUT YOU NEVER KNOW. GOOD LUCK, I HOPE IT
 MAY HELP. &gt;&gt;
