i had a factory kit on my 71 bus that bolted up to the frame (into pre-
drilled and tapped holes). but my 73 didn't have those same holes so i
never got around to putting any hitch on it.

now, for the vanagons, check the rigid hitch folks (at the top). that came
from an article in the VW Autoist (vw club of america) ... it attaches to
the 'tow eyes' under the rear bumper, and so is out of the way of most
everything. but regardless of the hitch you get, always remember: it's a
vw bus!! you can't pull very much! ;)

for tow bars up front, i've seen a couple on buses, but they were all custom
jobs. no suppliers known at present. :(
