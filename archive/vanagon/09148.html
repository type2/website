     Hi dudes,
     
     I need to adjust the steering on my '64 Split. So I go to undo the 
     adjusting screw and it's pretty tight. So I thought that I didn't want 
     to strip the thread coz the casing's only Aluminium.
     
     So, can I undo the four bolts that hold the end casing off and take 
     off the casing without any worries. Ok the oil will all come out. But 
     are there any springy or small bits to err, misplace? The pictures in 
     the book look fairly straightforward but It'd be nice to here some 
     experiences.
     
     Also having trouble greasing my King-pins. Well I just can't get the 
     grease through on one of the grease points, the drivers side bottom 
     point. Any wise old stories about how to get that old grease out 
     without taking the engine out ?? ;-)
     
     
     cheers dudes,
     
     Lee.
     
     '64 Samba - yep the one you've read about
     '78 FIAT  - it's got a poorly leg at the moment
