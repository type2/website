Subject: wailaki potluck - urgent!


I need all of your help.  A number of people are leaving in the next
few days to go on vacation early, and will be meeting us up at Wailaki,
or wherever Jack Stafford finds for us to go, if he doesn't like
Wailaki.  

Several of you I'm not sure of regarding even your attendance at this
eveng August 25-27.  Others I know are coming, but I've not heard
about your potluck contribution.  Please let me know ASAP.   I know
it's
tempting to leave these things til the last minute, but in the case
of it being so hard to distribute this information this week on account
of so many people being gone, I'd appreciate hearing from you as
early as possible regarding attendance and food.  If this gets too
nebulous for too long, we'll probably have to go to each person bring
just their own food.

Hurry!

Thanks,

/martha
