&gt;be aware that you NEED to change your oil after two bottles of this stuff 
...
&gt;it supposedly dilutes the oil pretty badly ... so Steve, i think you need 
an
&gt;oil change right away, what with the STP AND the Techron. :)


Maybe if you put it in the gas tank instead of the crankcase...???   :^)
