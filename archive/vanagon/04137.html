&gt; &gt; Anyone have any maintenance tips besides vacuming the spider webs?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I thought my 'falia was the only one that takes two hours and
&gt; 1,672 clicks of the ignitor button to start the fridge on propane!
&gt; Guess not.  The stove burners ignite right away.

When I bought my 82 Westy in May, I thought I had a bum fridge.  I took 
it to a RV shop for servicing.  The dude there said that other than 
cleaning the fur of a golden lab off of it (previous owners) he said it 
worked fine. 
Following his advice (see steps below.), I can get it started on the 
third or fourth click EVERYTIME!

	1. Get front/rear and left/right bubble levels installed in a
convienient location.  I use the dash.  Cheap at any RV shop.  Be sure 
the van is Level prior to sticking these on!
	2. Spend whatever time neccessary to get that bug EXACTLY level.
 	3. Turn on fridge gas and switch to gas.
	4. Light both stove burners.
	5. clear a spot to see pilot light. Insure that it is dark enough 
to see it light.
	6. use the pump 20-25 times.
	7. holding in the safety button, click the igniter.
	8. If it doesn't start the first time (mine often does.) pump 
once and try 7 again.
	9. When it starts, hold onto the safety button for a little 
while.  Otherwise, it will go out.

The two important ones for me were leveling and insuring that it was dark 
enough to see the pilot light when it did start.  I probably spent alot 
of time lighting an already lit fridge.

P.S even my testosterone handicapped SO mastered this  ;&gt;

                      LATER,
                             Brad
