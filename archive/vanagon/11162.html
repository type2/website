&gt; Last night I finally healed one of my busses larges wounds.  Someone

&gt; I welded it up (luckily they'd left the original piece) sealed it with
&gt; some auto-body caulk and undercoated it.  It sounds completely different
&gt; in the bus now!  I estimate I got rid of 80% of the rattles this way!

I've noticed this `improvement' in several splits here in WA. The
only thing that this makes easier to reach (depending on how much of
the bus you want to butcher) is the shift linkage, I guess, but if
the linkage was installed correctly in the first place (facing down),
this isn't much of a problem. I suppose if the hole were big enough,
you could do clutch adjustments, which is a *major* pain without a
hole like this.
   Another `improvement' I've seen is the cutting away of the spare
tire to make an instant walkthrough camper. Anyone else have any
they wish to add?
