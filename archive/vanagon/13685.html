Subject:       Re: Westy Flue Vent Cover


&gt; A friend of mine keeps breaking the flue vent cover of his westy.  VW gets
&gt; something like $20 for these, as I'm told.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a cheaper source?
&gt; 
&gt; What do most folks do?  Just don't bother?

I never use mine.  The manual says only to cover the flue if you are 
going to wash the van or direct water around the flue itself.  If you 
cover it, you take a chance of letting condensation collect in the 
breather tubes.  I also leave my vent under the fridge (the brass 
end) off during the winter months.

The only time I put it on, is when I take the van in for service.  
Sometimes the dealer likes to wash the van, and they use high 
pressure.  Most of the time I remember to leave a note for them not 
to do that either!

Harry.
