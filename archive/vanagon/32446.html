Subject:       Re: Taller tranny for Vanagon (was: a snowy day)

When I bought my bus it had itty bitty tires on the back and 205/70's 
on the front.  I switched them to see what would happen and i did get 
a nice increase in pickup and a little help at top end.  I don't 
remember what size those original tires were but the ran at 44psi and 
were definately low profile.  if you are already using tires in the 
185 to 205 range you might have to make a substantial jump to see any 
results and then, i would worry about getting too big and wearing out 
the tranny when accelecating from a stop.
