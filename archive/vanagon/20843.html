&gt;Hi, just want to find out if I am alone in this. '85 lock cylinders wore out

Happened to me as well, on two buses (81 &amp; 85) - they are not worn out, just 
clogged up so the little &quot;blades&quot; in the lock are not pushed back to their 
neutral position by the springs. Thus the lock acts just like you had the 
key in there.

Take the cylinders out, be careful not to loose the small springs!
Clean them and get rid of the old grease layer, then put on some new grease.
