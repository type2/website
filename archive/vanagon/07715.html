Steve Johnson asks me for clarification on sealing that bleeder 
screw:
&gt; Thanks for the input Dan.  Umm, can you be more specific on which loctite
&gt; to use?  There are lots of different types ya know. ;)

I'm a Loctite nut (sorry).  some people get off on 3M, I do Loctite.  
Seriously tho, I use it for gasket replacements or just doping 
up the gasket for better sealing.  If the stuff seals leaks on 
British bikes its got my seal fo approval (it does-- my 
Norton-in-limbo is dry).  I don't have Loctite numbers at hand but 
you can buy it per the description as follows:

Ultra-Blue gasket maker/sealer-  good stuff, oil and anti-freeze 
resistant.  Dries to a rubbery texture.  Used on said bleeder screw, 
it also lubricates the metal against plastic threads on that tight 
fit hole (line too obvious to punch).  Follow the directions and 
dry off the threads of the bleeder screw hole by stuffing a rag into the 
hole before inserting the screw.  I use ALOT of this stuff and 
have been very pleased with the results. 

Ultra-Copper gasket maker/sealer- also good stuff but with higher 
temp resistance than the blue. 

Ultra-Grey-- supposedly an OEM type sealant for Asian cars, I don't 
know much about this but the package cautions against using it in 
 non-recommedned applications.  I can find out more later.

The back of the blister packs give a good description and application 
guide.  I suppose there's a FAQ on sealants somewhere, if not let me 
know and I can write one up with specificity.
