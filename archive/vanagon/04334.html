Subject:      ok here's the scoop so far...

OK. I called THE VOLKSDOKTOR here in Louisville. Using aftermarket parts and a
SIX MONTH/SIX THOUSAND MILE WARRANTY!!!! (VW offered 12 months/15,000 mi for
VW parts or 90 day/warranty on aftermarket.

The Volksdoktor offered the same work (and 6+6 warranty) for a grand total of
$265.00 (est.).

Can you guess where I'm going? Also, VW was about to charge me for the
alignment they surely didn't do BEFORE the other work they wanted to do. DAMN!
These guys piss me off. I've had a bad VW week! :-(
