Subject: RE: '73 1700 rebuild

Bob King has the right idea about Dan's valve adjustment (where the adjuster
had to be backed way off to get proper lash.)  Very likely the pushrod is
hung up on the front edge of the lifter, rather than seated right.  Get it
in right before you start the engine, or it won't be able to carry oil like
it's s'posed to.
