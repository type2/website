&gt;I saw this in austin.forsale and thought someone might want it.  I know
&gt;nothing about the condition or the seller.

&gt;Hey all you campers fans,
&gt;I have a 1977 vw camper, yellow/orange with pop top, no stove sink but no
&gt;pump.
&gt;The tent is in great shape (water stained but very much intact) good tires
&gt;etc. Beds upstairs and down, ice box and curtains all around, original.
&gt;
&gt;Motor, basket case, I think I droped a valve guide and she will need at least
&gt;a new jug/piston and a valve job on that side. The motor is out for you to
&gt;inspect. It ran proir to droping the motor but she bled oil out of the
&gt;muffler. The valve guide banged around in side the number 2 cylinder.
&gt;She has about 130,000 miles on the body, I am not sure about the engine, I am
&gt;the 3rd owner, it seems that is was rebuilt at some point??? Don't remember.
&gt;
&gt;Take it away!!!!! All of it!
&gt;I give up!
&gt;$350.
