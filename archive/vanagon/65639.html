&gt; OK, I know that you guys are probably getting sick of me poping up on
&gt; the list and announcing that my 82 is fixed and then coming back in a
&gt; couple of days moaning about how its broke again, but here I am.  Here's
&gt; the deal:
&gt;
&gt; Bought the Bentley book
&gt; Did the testing of the FI system
&gt; Replaced the bad Temp 2 sensor
&gt; Did all checks per the book
&gt; All checks are in spec
&gt;
&gt; Engine starts cold (of course down here in West Texas that means
&gt; approximately 70 degrees in the morning),
&gt; Drive it to work (approx 5 miles) with no problem.
&gt; The day warms up (80-85 degrees) by lunchtime and when I get in the
&gt; beast to go home, it runs really rich, smokes and hardly makes it home.
&gt; Disgusted, I leave it at home and drive the wife's Hyundai back to work.
&gt; The day continues to heat up (approx 90 or so by 5 pm) and when I get
&gt; home, I start the beast and there is no problem.  No smoke, no rough
&gt; running, nothing!  WHAT AM I MISSING HERE?  (sorry to shout, but I'm
&gt; REALLY frustrated).  Has anyone got a clue?  I've searched the archives
&gt; to no avail.  HELP!!
&gt;
Take TBill's all purpose advice: ALWAYS suspect the O2 sensor.  It may
not be the problem, but it usually is, and it's no bother or expense to
disconnect it and see if that solves the problem.
