&gt; Can anyone give me more information about those Canadian rebuilds?  
Who do you &gt; order from and what kind of warranty are on them?

My '88 had a VW Canada rebuilt installed by PO in '92. It has gone 
170,000 km since with no sign of trouble so far. No coolant loss in 
last 10k (since I bought it), burns about 1/2 litre of Mobil 1 every 
3000 km, compression about 125-135 on all 4.
It was installed by the VW dealer at the time.
