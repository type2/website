Of course it means less maintenance! Think about it for a sec; no crawling
under there every 4000 miles for a knucklebusting adjustment. Just that alone
is worth it. Generally a quieter engine too. I'd do it, I've owned both, in a
74 and now a 78 with hydraulics. The 78 is the way to go.

Guy with all this knuckles.
