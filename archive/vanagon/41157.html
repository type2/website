Subject: RE: Moose


&gt;I have a friend who nicked and thought he killed a deer (looked like a
&gt;moose) Let's say a 71 camper with a tire on the front
&gt;for VW content and to make the story believable. They put the
&gt;deer in the back cause they did not want to waste the meet.  Only to
&gt;find out after drivin away, the darn thing weren't
&gt;dead.


In fact, it would like to go for a walk.


OK, OK, Sorry...    :^)
