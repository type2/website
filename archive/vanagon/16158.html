Subject: new trip proposal!


Ok, folks with Gnatt and Bodega coming up, I can't help but think
we need to start &quot;considering&quot; what we're interested in doing next.
This recent post about Baja prompted B. Prunehead to mention that
a trip there would be fun, which I agree.

I assume we're talking about something more extensive than crossing
the line into Tijuana, so need some suggestions for places in Mexico.

Secondly, which months?
