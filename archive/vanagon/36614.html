&gt;      This is a wonderful use of the internet !   Great Pictures.

Well there's your problem right there.  Ooops wait a minute.  I guess
I should be posting this to alt.flame.win95.die.die.die

Boy, I can imagine the volume on that one..and people complain about 
the alt.binaries wasting bandwidth!

Now for the VW content: Being that it a busy Friday afternoon and the 
sun's shining, the flowers are blooming, and I can't get VWs off my mind... 
can someone send me the URL for those pics again - I trashed it I 
think...
Thx.

ps: Thanks, Tim for the comp numbers - I'll run the test tonight...

Shawn.
