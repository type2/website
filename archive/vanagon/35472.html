                                         Positive Things

A recent thread asked for positive examples of the benefits of bus ownership.
 That is the sort of question that reveals far more than it asks.  On the
surface it appears to be a simple request for information, to which I've
responed in the first part of what follows.  But peering deeper into our
navels, we're liable to come upon a lint-ball we're unwilling to touch.

Those of you who have seen my 1965 bus know it is not a thing of beauty.  The
paint scabrous and pie-bald.  One reason for its rough appearance is because
the bus is in constant use, there is no time for cosmetic things. Tasked with
a 900 mile trip several times a year plus an occasional longer jaunt, more
than 1,500 miles to attend the Big Sur outing, or hauling a ton of Portland
cement to the top of Mt. Palomar, the bus is expected and required to do all.
 And it does.

The simplicity of the engine's design makes it amenable to modification,
allowing incorporation of modern technological benefits not available when
the vehicle was manufactured, such as electronic ignition, a full-flow oil
filtration system, a better cooling system and more reliable electrical
components; it now uses an alternator rather than a generater and runs better
for it.

The bus handles better than it did when new, thanks to better tires and a
stronger suspension system.  Most importantly, the bus gets better gas
mileage, requires less maintenance and is more reliable.  Because of its age
the cost of insurance is low, as is the annual license fee and it does not
require the biannual smog inspection expected of younger vehicles, although
its emissions are an order of magnitude less than those allowed by law.

My bus has not had an easy life and I am at least its fourth owner.  It has
suffered from collision and all of its major mechanical components have worn
out through its years of service.  But as things wore out, they were
repaired, overhauled or replaced so that today only the front axle assembly
and chassis are original as-manufactured parts, and the front axle will be
replaced before I set out to drive to Inuvik, a few oceans away.

All of these things argue for the postive aspects of bus ownership yet to the
mainstream of American thought, my bus and I are examples of failure.  The
bus contains not a single molded plastic cup-holder.  It has neither
carpeting, air-conditioning nor stereo.  Indeed, it has no radio at all and
incorporates none of the supposedly necessary features, all of which were
designed for the lazy, thoughtless and immature.  My bus has neither buzzers
nor chimes nor even a light that springs on when I open the door.  All of
that falls to me.  If light is needed, I must turn it on.  I am responsible
for my own safety, and for the safe operation and maintenance of the vehicle.
In a society were no one is ever at fault, the buck stops here.  

And therein lies the message and the only valid answer.  The reliability --
the honesty and functionality -- of any vehicle, system, agency or anything
else, is nothing more than a reflection of the person in charge.  My bus.  My
responsibility.  If it craps out, it's my fault.  No excuses.  This applies
equally to every aspect of our lives.  We have the capacity to shape our
lives and determine our own destiny.  Not some group or governmental agency
or Book.  You are the person in charge.  You may accept or deny your
responsibilities.  The evidence indicates most have chosen denial.   
 
The purpose of this list is not to preach the obvious but to illuminate the
obscure.  Unfortunately, in the modern age the obvious is often obscured, and
not by chance alone.  If the logic of that is unclear it's good evidence your
life is not your own.  You need to achieve a higher plane to achieve a
broader view.
