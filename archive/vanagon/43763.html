Bill,

I say we duel it out:  My bungee of choice wrapped around my rear bumper
muscled by 1600cc of throbbing single port power vs any length of duct tape
you choose around your porsche-powered patootie.  The bus with the most mass
remaining after the tug wins.  And speaking of Genesis, I believe on the
seventh day, a big tour of the whole sheebang was planned in a Westy but
postponed due to starter troubles...


&gt;Ron Van Ness sings the praises of bungee cords, but I think duct tape was
&gt;created DAYS earlier in Genesis.  You can do lots of things with duct tape
&gt;that you can't do with bungee cords, practically nothing with bungee cords
&gt;that you can't do with duct tape.  Rear engine mounts are probably near the
&gt;limit of duct tape's capability, but with three or four rolls, if they were
&gt;fresh ...
