Subject:      coolant stuff ...

someone asked if there was a consensus on this coolant stuff ...

from what i see in the stuff that Dan Houg posted, as well as in the
stuff in the FAQ, and previously posted, the one over-riding thing is:

REPLACE YOUR COOLANT REGULARLY.

period.

which, if you think about it, makes sense. you replace your engine oil ...
because it collects contamination and &quot;wears out&quot;. and automatic transmission
fluid needs replacing after a while. likewise, manual transmission can
benefit from replacing the oil. and the brake fluid needs replacing. so why
not the coolant?

the question is: why does the vw vanagon owner's manual specify that the
coolant is NOT to be replaced??

the rule of thumb that i've always heard is:
replace ALL fluids in/on a car at least every two years.
