&gt; &gt; or two-day if possible. Good VWs tend to get snapped up fairly quickly.
&gt; 
&gt; Ain't that the truth.  Like by 8 am Thursday morning.  You really have

	A friend's mother snaps up all the papers &amp; recyclers in the
LA area (at like 5am, if she can get her hands on them that early!)
and is on the phone by around 6am to scoop up all the clean Beetle 'Verts
(and late model motorcycles...).  Shows up with cash in hand, gets
the title; associate picks 'em up later, takes 'em straight to San
Piedro.  They can shove 1/2 dozen (...hmm, or is it 8?) 'Verts, stacked
two high, in a container, and off they go to Holland.  The early bird
(or is it the Dutch?;) gets the worm.  Got to go &quot;shopping&quot; with her
one day during winter break from college.  Man, the cars they had there
on the dock ready to ship out... Jags, Ferraris, a '78 VW with 8k on
the clock (triple white 'vert...).  Crazy.
