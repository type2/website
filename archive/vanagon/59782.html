Subject: buying a vanagon camper in Europe

Hi!
I'm planning a trip to Europe for four months in the spring of 1998 and
want to buy a good, reliable used VW camper over there.  My plan is to
store it there at the end of the trip so that I can use it whenever I go
back.  I figure tying up the capital is worth it since to rent one costs
about $1000 a week according to all the literature I've seen so far.  Do
you have recommended dealers in Europe with whom I can correspond to see
what they can do for me in finding a camper within my budget?  Do you have
any advice or info that will help me with my plan to buy and operate a van
in Europe on a permanent basis?  I've travelled Europe in a VW van under
the old &quot;buy it there, drive it, and ship it home&quot; deal that went out a
couple of years ago when the models changed, so I know about driving a
camper over there... it's buying a used one that is worrying me.  I'd feel
much better if I could find a really reliable dealer in used VWs, and set
up as much of the deal as possible in advance of arrival.
Thanks for any help you can provide.
