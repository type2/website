Subject: Re: Window tinting

Princess of Flannel inquires whether she or a tradesman should take the old
tint off her back window.  I'd say tradesman, as I have no idea what solvent
will pull the tint but not the defogger traces.  And it will have to be 
solvent because the defogger traces will tolerate no scraping to speak of.
