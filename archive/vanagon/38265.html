Subject: '90 Syncro rear heater leak

Hi Everyone.  Well, I'm still obsessed with my spring cleaning, and I 
thought I would remove the rear heater so that I can clean out the 
snorkel that was filthy.

This is an easy job, only taking a few minutes to do, but when I went 
to lift up the heater, my left hand got wet.  Hmmm... blue goo... :(  
Coolant is leaking ever so slowly from the max/min valve.  It appears 
to be coming out of the shaft of the lever that goes into the valve.  
There were no puddles, but after I disturbed it, it would leave a 
drip about the size of a dime *when the engine was cold*.  As the 
engine warmed up, it didn't leak.  Yeah, sure... make me insane!

Does anybody know if these valves can be changed independently from 
the heater core?.. it looks like it all comes apart, but who knows how 
VW sells these parts.  The Bentley doesn't say much about this 
heater, and is rather disapointing.   

This is a major bummer... just had the cooling system pressure 
checked last week, and coolant flushed.  

Thanks for any words of wisdom

Harry.
