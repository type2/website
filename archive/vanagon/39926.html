Subject: Bus wanted / Ghia for sale (San Diego)

HI folks.  I'm looking for a '71 camper in good condition in San Diego, and
would appreciate any leads on this.  I'm not completely familiar with these
vans, so I'd also appreciate some local help - would any of the San Diegan
list members volunteer to help me inspect one or two cars?  (I would, of
course, be willing to compensate you for your time, with payment in the
form of wine, beer, house plants or other wares.)

Secondly, in order to afford the above bus, I need to sell my '72 Karmann
Ghia coupe.  $2400, please e-mail for details.

Cheers,
Ross
