Subject: Parting out 85 GL

Hello all
        Well if I were Irish, that would explain it but since I'm not I
must just be *%$# lucky.  In the last hour of an epic 16 day journey the
exhaust on my 84 self destructed in an incredible din previously likened
only to muscle cars.  The next day, seeing dollar signs in the clouds, I
happened across a great bargain; a tan 85 GL with a trashed
crankshaft/block but with a brand new exhaust.  The owner had just gone
through the van to get it road worthy, sparing no expense, when it blew
(most of us will now shudder at the thought).  Throwing caution to the wind
I snapped up the ailing van and that new exhaust now resides in 'babe the
blue ox canoe hauler' (my 84 GL).  &quot;Ah Hah&quot;, those of you who scored well
on the logic portion of the GRE are now saying &quot;what in tarnation are you
going to do with the rest of the van&quot;.  And that, of course, is my problem.
Derelict cars are not well thought of in Wisconsin as they take up
valuable space better filled by cows or surplus dairy products.  As it
stands now I'm going to have to work like one of Santa's little elves to
strip that tan van and get it to the boneyard before the city gets wise.
So 85 GL owners (or anyone else with an appropriate year Vanagon), have I
got a deal for you.  This van is in great shape (too nice to be a parts van
my conscience is telling me), nice interior (though of a bizarre brown
shade only Volkswagon could love), good metal, all mechanical is there
except for the block and all contained within (when the crankshaft blew, it
really blew -- not 'rebuildable'), manual tranny, AC, new brake stuff etc.
Just send me an E-Mail and help ease my storage woes.  Oh yeah, and by the
way, for all you 'West Coasties'.  V-Dub buses were made to carry canoes,
not surf boards, got it.
Hope I can help someone out
Chris
