On Tue, 17 Oct 1995 22:06:36 -0500 you said:
&gt;I was recently discussing winter vanagon experiences with a buddy of mine,
&gt;and he mentioned that a limited slip rear differential was a factory option
&gt;for two-wheel drive models.  I know a locking differential was a syncro
&gt;option, but was a similar rear diff available for two-wheelies?

yup. but only in germany. :( they (vw) have LOTS of stuff available (on
special order) which the u.s. and canada did NOT get. :(

however, there is a fellow out in california that makes a LSD for the
vanagon transmission ... costs about $300 plus installation (you've got
to find some tranny shop that can do it.) it's not really hard to do
(according to the article in HOT VWs magazine) since you are only fooling
with the differential end of the transmission.  i can send you the name and
address of the guy if you want it.
