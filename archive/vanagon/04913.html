Subject: Re: ticked off!!!

 
&gt; Anyway, the amazing thing is that this van was complete in every way, down
&gt; to the battery and air cleaner.  All original 6V stuff.  It had a vent in
&gt; the roof and 3 small louvered windows on each side.  I guess it had started
&gt; life as a panel van.  This bus is rusted to pieces!!! Seems odd for a bus
&gt; that was born and died in San Diego.  Maybe it lived it's life on the East
&gt; coast and came back to San Diego to die??  :)  Inside, it was not a walk
&gt; through, and had two opposing bench seats with a table in between, a closet,
&gt; and an icebox with faucet above (but I don't remember a sink...) and a little
&gt; flip up table next to the door.  All reasonably intact.  What a bitter end
&gt; for this beautiful little camper!!!
&gt; 

David, where in San Diego did you find this.  I have a similar interior
and am looking for some original tables, icebox, etc.  Was the interior
done in wood paneling?  Please let me know.  I live in SoCal so I could
pop on over there tomorrow.  Thanks.
