Subject: 2.0 litre vacuum conections
Date: Fri, 14 Oct 1994 13:33:06 +0100 (MET DST)


About 2 years ago, the 1600 in my bus expired and I was
offered a cheap 2 litre, so I thought I would give it ago.

Well its been in for some time and hauls me around quite
nicely, however, not having a manual for that covers this
engine (my Haynes only covers the 1600 version), and it
being Friday afternoon and work seems *very* hard to do, 
a couple of questions spring to mind.

Firstly, what is the correct way to connect all the vacuum points on
the engine. I've got the vaccumm from the left hand carb connected
straight to the dizzy advance/retard, the way I would expect it to
be on any other car. However, the right hand arm of the air box has
a thermostatic type switch which I think should be in the circuit
somewhere? Then there is the pipe that runs between the carbs. This
has a small `box' in the middle with another pick off point. I've
just blanked this off, and as the engine seems to run fine, it stayed
like that. Where should it go?

Secondly, I would like to balance the carbs. I took the van along
to the local carb place (with a big Solex sign hanging outside), to
see how much he would charge, but he refuses to touch vw campers?!?

So how can I go about this. I've a set of vacuum gauges, which work
fine when balancing the carbs on my bike, but the bike has pick off points
on the inlet manifolds which make the job easy. If I understand the carb
set up on the van, the left hand carb controls the fuel to all cylinders
at tick over, which leads me to wonder about where I should be trying to
get the vacuum reading(s) and at what rpm?

Well this all appears to be very confused, but any ideas/answers would
be appreciated and would give me an excuse to leave early and go and
play with the van :)
