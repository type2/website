Subject: Re: bus accident

i took a header myself, got hit by one of those dinky little satan toyota
pickups.  it hit me head on then spun around to the driver side mid section,
then someone following me to close hit my rear.   my bus, 72 westy, drove
barely afterwards and the insurance companies said they were going to declare
it totaled i fought with them about its classic value, and actually got 4200
bucks, even though it was worth roughly 6000 (i mean the work i did on it,
they are actually priceless as we all know). so i let her go and bought her
back from the salvage company stripped her and let her go again.
oh yes, no major injuries in the crash.  my girlfriend bruised her sternum on
the seat belt.
