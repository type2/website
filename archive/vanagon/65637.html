&gt; I have a very low mileage 89 Westy for sale.  Blue-gray with matching
&gt; poptop, automatic transmission, power steering/ locks/ windows/ mirrors.
&gt; Air conditioning works perfectly.  Elaborate stereo system with CD changer
&gt; (installed in compartment behind driver's seat) plus cassette and premium
&gt; speakers.
&gt;
&gt; Auxiliary battery (installed in rear cabinet) and alarm.  Never camped in,
&gt; still has plastic over stove.  Numerous other extras.  Could deliver to
&gt; most parts of the US. Email or call Bill at 314-539-1406 (daytime) or
&gt; 314-918-0720 (eves).
Now, THAT's a deal!! Please someone go for it. (Too bad its automatic)
Cris.
