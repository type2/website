Subject: FS: '93 EV GL

Saw it at a dealer in Orange Park, FL.

1993
Light Green
20,000 miles
Perfect condition
Automatic
Asking $16,500

They also have a '93 MV that looks like it spent the night on the beach 
and the tide came in.  Sad shape, but cheap. Probably about $13,000

Don't know anything else about it.
e-mail me if your interested and I find the number.
