Subject:      Vanagon transmission rebuilders/sources?

Hi all:

A few months ago I reported that the transmission in my '81 ( &gt; 200K
miles) was starting to whine in 1st and 2nd.

Guess what....  It hasn't gotten any better, and 3rd is starting to whine
too!

So at some point I'm going to have to bite the bullet and fix this.  Can
anyone recommend a transmission rebuilder in the SF Bay Area (or Northern
California in general) or other reputable source for a replacement trans?

Also, I have a transmission I took out of a wreak that I could put in, but
I'm not sure of its condition.  I assume there's no reliable way to tell
if it's OK short of installing it in the car and driving around?
