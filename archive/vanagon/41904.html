Subject: 2.1 Engine Swap(Pulsing idle)

        
Hello,

I just finshed swaaping a tired(130K+) 1.9l in my 1985 Camper with a
fresh(46K) 2.1 from a 1988.
Boy, what a difference. I am having a slight problem. After the engine warms
up the idle 
pulses up and down. It doesn't feel like it is going to stall, but it did
not do it in 
the van the motor came out of. I believe that all the wires are connected(no
extras).
I am using the 1.9 ECU and distributor. All plumbing was modified for the
2.1 motor. Has anyone 
had a similar experience with their motor. 
Any suggestions?

Thanks.
