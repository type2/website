Subject: Bentley/Bosch FI book

Hey all,
Tonight I bought a book put out by Robert Bentley Publishers entitled &quot;How to
Understand, Service and Modify Bosch Fuel Injection and Engine Management&quot; by
Charles O. Probst, SAE.

It covers LH-Motronic, Motronic, LH-Jetronic, L-Jetronic (that's us breadloaves,
beetles, and air-cooled vanagons), D-Jetronic (that's for the Type 3's),
KE-Motronic, KE-Jetronic, and K-Jetronic.

It seems to be fairly comprehensive, with chapters covering a basic overview,
engine management fundamentals, pulsed injection theory, pulsed injection
troubleshooting and service (has separate sections for each type of fi),
continuous injection theory, continuous injection troubleshooting and service,
and a section on tuning for performance and economy.

It seems to be very well written and is a bit more detailed than the Bentley VW
manual regarding troubleshooting plus the theory section is really nice.  I like
knowing how this stuff works :) .

I got mine at Books-A-Million, so I'm sure a regular bookstore could get it.  It
cost $30 which seems a bit expensive, so maybe you can find it cheaper.

Off to read...

Sean
