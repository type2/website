Subject:       Westy Refer - Overheated??

Well I finally screwed up yesterday and, in clear contravention of the 
Westy manual,  left both the gas and 12V heaters running simultaneously (for 
about 2 hours).  Nice cold beer though!!  Actually, nothing &gt;&gt;seems&lt;&lt; to 
be broken at this point, though I'm planning on checking out the poor 12v 
heater solo, just to be sure.  

BTW, this is a pretty easy mistake to make:  Just leave the gas control 
(the 90 degree rotating knob) in the &quot;On&quot; position and push the &quot;Battery&quot; 
selector switch button.  The selector switch does NOT shut the gas off - 
it will continue to burn - it just disables the piezoelectric gas starter 
and turns on the 12V heater power - instant dual heater.

I guess the two obvious areas of concern are overheating the 12V heater 
(insulation breakdown;  oxidation of the element; etc) and overheating the 
sealed refrigeration unit (overpressure/rupture of the system;  
deterioration of the refrigerant or absorbant; etc).  

Has anybody had any experience with running both heaters at the same time? 
Any problems?
