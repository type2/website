Subject:      Pa.  VW Show This Sun - See Ya There!

Well, a number of list members have e-mailed and said they're going, so I
guess I'll get off the fence and commit (barring bad weather).  To recap,
the show is at the Home Furnishings Outlet Mall directly off the Morgantown
exit of the Pa. turnpike (just east of Reading, and about an hour from
Philadelphia), this Sunday, from 9 to 3.  Sounds like it will be a fairly
good show.

I'll be set up in the vending area, on the main vending isle coming from
the entry gate.  You'll have to walk right past me to get anywhere so I
should be easy to spot.  I'll have my blue '89 Westy a big yellow banner,
and a trailer full of Bus and Vanagon parts.

If you'd like to make my site a List meeting place like last time, I'd be
honored.  Maybe 11 AM?   Also, if anyone needs me to bring something in
particular, let me know.  The weather forecast so far is 75 degrees and
sunny - a perfect day for a show!

See you then,
