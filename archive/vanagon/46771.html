Subject: Re: My '77 &quot;Vanagon&quot;


&gt;Sick of having to recharge my old no-name battery everytime I
&gt;wanted to go out in Samiam, my green '77 Westy, I auled myself
&gt;to Sears for one of those fine Die-Hards.
&gt;
&gt;In the catalog and the computer, it turns out that my '77 VW
&gt;Transporter is really a &quot;Vanagon!&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Which list (VANAGON, type2) should I participate in?  I wonder
&gt;if I get a free radiator from Sears! :-)

Clearly, you should be on v_at_l. Real busses don't have batteries. When we
want them to go, we push them. ;)

Hie thee to type2, and stop and get us some beer on the way.
