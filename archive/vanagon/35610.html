&gt;And, hey, when was the last time you
&gt;had somebody on the freeway ask you to open your window to ask you if your
&gt;ride might be FOR SALE, while driving 60m's per H?  (I've actually had this
&gt;happen twice with my 60 Singlecab, and you should SEE the thing!)

I get that a lot in my '66 'Stang convertible. You should see jaws drop
when I tell them I paid $1200 for it as a junker, with a metal roof!   :^)
