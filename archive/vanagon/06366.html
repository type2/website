&gt;well, i'm gonna be gone thursday and friday (maybe) so i thought i'd 
dump
&gt;these on everybody while i had the chance. and, besides, it's november 
and
&gt;i haven't begged and pleaded with the Unknowns to jump in and join a
&gt;model year. :)  we need a 57 bus, a 65 bus, and about 16 breadloafs 
(that
&gt;would put them up to 100!). i'd love to see over 50 microbuses, but i'm
&gt;afraid that might be wishful thinking. :(  and you eurovans need ONE 
more
&gt;to make it up to ten.

Intro:  I'm one of the new unknowns and I do have the missing 65 
microbus.  It's a Westphalia with the split front seats and a pop top.
Also have a 67 Westy, 59 Single cab and a 71 Karman Ghia convert.
I'm always looking for parts for any of the above so let me know if 
anyone has any extras.
