Hi Everyone.  Well, after a month off, I'm back.  We camped 22 days
during the month.

We travelled up through the Canadian Rockies via
Hwy 1 to Lake Louise, did a side trip to Calgary, and then up Hwy 93
to the Columbia Icefields, then onto Jasper, and back home via the
Yellowhead (Hwy 5), and Fraser Canyon, (Hwy 1).   This loop was 2445
km (1519 miles).  We stayed in an awesome campground at the
Icefields, about 1 km sound of the Icefields Centre.  It's a
primitive site, but just perfect for a Westy, tenters, or small
pickups.  The view from here was awesome.  I was recovering from a
broken foot, and couldn't do too much hiking this year, but we'll be
back to see more!  In Jasper, list member Tony Schiebel and his
family joined us from Edmonton. He arrived with his '87(?) Syncro
Westy, and his father-in-law with his '91(?) Multivan.  It was great
to meet the rest of Tony's family.  Tony just got some wicked steel
bumpers front and rear on the Syncro.  Like this is awesome stuff.
Pictures, please Tony!!

On the last part of our vacation we made two short trips, one to
Manning Park for 3 days of glorious sunshine.  It got down to 0C (32
F) at night, and was just beautiful with all the colours changing on
the trees.  We are up over 4000 ft there.  And yesterday, we came
back from Osoyoos, in the southern Okanagan where it was basically
sunny and 25C.  Very nice, especially since it was raining in
Vancouver the whole time :)  On our way back, we picked up some fresh
fruit.

So, after 3601 km (2237 miles), we had a very nice time.  The van was
awesome for us, and was a pleaure to drive during our trip.  We saw
many VW vans of various configurations, even a Syncro Westy
(excluding Tony's).

Glad to be back...
Harry.
