-- [ From:  * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --

Craig,

I had the same experience with a cheap, &quot;bargain,&quot; cap and rotor kit.  A
penitent return to Bo$ch settled the matter for me.  I think the
inexpensive kit was a Wells product.

The only thing wrong with it now is the cap and rotor contacts corrode in 
just a couple of thousand miles.  I wonder if anyone else has experienced 
this?
