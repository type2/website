Subject: Extra Type IV sump plate

  Matt Bushore is looking for a sump plate:

  I think I have a stock one &lt;no temp sender&gt; in my junk box. Send your snail
  mail address to me at dkautz_at_hpsidms1.sid.hp_dot_com and it will be on it's way
  shortly. BTW, have you tried the Porsche dealer? 914s and 912Es had 
  senders in those sump plates as stock I think. When my neighbor added 
  gauges to his '81, he told me he used a sump plate from a 914. The whole 
  process looked very expensive though - once he had installed the gauge, he
  decided that the oil was too hot. That cost him an aux. cooler, which of
  course had to have stainless steel braided lines and it's own fan, 
  thermostatically switched .......... Ignorance is bliss.
