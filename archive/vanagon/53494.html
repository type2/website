Subject: '85 vac lines
Date: Thu, 26 Dec 96 08:29:26 -0600


&gt;&gt;electronics, exhaust, FI, etc., but the problem I am having is sorting out
&gt;&gt;the extra vacuum lines. These are the larger ones on the air-cleaner side
&gt;&gt;of the motor. On is even has a Y-shaped fitting on it. 
&gt;
&gt;

there may be one or two &quot;Y&quot; vacuum lines.  each is hooked to a vacuum
solenoid for boosting idle speed during A/C use and when there is an engine
load from the PS pump.  if you're current set up doesn't have either A/C or
PS, then you don't need them and they should be blanked off.  they 'work' by
bypassing air around the throttle plate thus give the equivalent of
'cracking' the throttle open.  these solenoids receive power and thus
activate by a pressure switch on the PS pump and by the A/C compressor
electrical clutch power.  a cool low tech solution.


in terms of getting of the road quickly, neither of these functions are
totally essential even if you have PS and A/C... it just helps keep the idle
from bogging down when these devices are used.  worst case scenario is the
engine kills when the A/C comes on or when you turn the wheel to full lock
when at an idle.
