Subject: E-mail address change
From: vanamaniac_at_juno_dot_com (Bradley L Spear)

I have added a new e-mail address.  The AOL account is still open but
e-mail on AOL is time and AOL time is $$.  This Juno account is free, Free, FREE!!!  So, I won't be on  the AOL as much.

The new address is:  vanamaniac_at_juno_dot_com
