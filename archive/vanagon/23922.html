                      RE&gt;Re[2]: Re[2]- 6v fuel gauge in            8/31/95

Coupla inputs I saw this morning reminded me about the possiblity of a VOLTAGE
REGULATOR!!!  I'd totally forgotten about that!.  My '81 diesel rabbit had
(according to Bentley) a voltage regulator on the instrument cluster
somewhere, and I'm sure that it supplied, among other things regulated (and
probably current limited too) power for the instruments and gas Gauge!!!!!!
That would solve the &quot;mystery&quot; abberation of Ohm's law because the circuit is
not running at battery voltage (12 instead of 6) but at some less than 6 volt
regulated level!

By the way - the only reason I ran the gal/mile x miles drive calculation was
to do a check on the calibration of the gauge to be sure it wasn't lying to me
and to know just &quot;how close - really&quot; am I to true empty based on measured
tank capacity.  Running out of gas in a fuel injected engine, gas or diesel is
a real &quot;NO-NO&quot;.


A general caution - most voltage regulators designed to stabilize 6 volts are
dropping the voltage to some stable lessor value, say 4-5 volts.  The extra
voltage is dissapated as heat.  The total dissapation is the voltage drop
times the current drawn (plus whatever inefficiencies).  If the same regulator
is now being supplied with 12 volts, the dissapation goes up a bunch!  If
yours has been working all along, I guess it is sufficiently robust to handle
it, but if the gas gauges suddenly stops working some day, or suddenly pegs
high all the time -  that would be an item to check.
