Subject: 62 dust-caps (front)

	Sarah,
	You ARE allowed to separate the wheel and the brake drum! I've
seen them removed and replaced together, and separated. I always do 'em 
separated.

	At the front:
	Under your rear hub caps, you found big castleated nuts with
cotter pins through them. The nuts fastened the rear-axles to the
rear hubs. Under the front hub caps you should find the dust caps,
like small metal cups, where the big nuts were at the back. 
	If the caps are gone, you'll see the front axle nuts, which look
smaller than the ones in the back and work different. I assume you're looking
at and trying to remove the dust caps. 

	Try using a rubber mallet or something else soft- plastic-headed
mallet, hit the cap solidly from the top or side, maybe pulling the hammer
toward yourself as it his so the impact tries to pull the cap out.
There ought to be a ridge that prevents the cap from going deeper into
the hole at the center of the drum- if you can get a screw-driver blade
onto the gap between the drum and the ridge and hammer on it, you may
be able to lever the cap up that way. 

	The same sort of arrangement can of dust-cap can be found on
the REAR axles of the water cooled VWs and most front-wheel drive cars. 

	For me, some combination of whoping the cap with a soft-headed
hammer, prying with a screw-driver and pulling on the cap with my
fingers usually gets it out of the drum. Your friend Liquid Wrench
might have a part to play here. Don't give up, and keep trying what
ever seems to move the *()*$%)#$)* cap.

	Installation is the reverse of removal- you fool around with
the dumb thing and a soft-headed hammer, trying to get the skirts
of the cap to all go into the hole through the drum. You try various
ways, and eventually it works. 


	What's going on, why are front and rear different?

	The rear axle is attached solidly to the rear brake hub, so there
is a big bolt there, torqued to big foot-pounds or Newtons. Turning the 
axle-shafts from the transmission turns the gears in the '62's reduction
boxes and the driven gear in the box drives the rear axle, which drives
the rear brake drum and rear hub. The rear axle bearings allow the axle
to rotate relative to the reduction box. There's no bearing beween
the brake drum and the rear axle.

	The front axle is just a little stub on the steering knuckle, 
not connected to gears anywhere. Turning the brake-drum and hub DOESN&quot;T
turn the front axle- its welded to the knuckle. So the bearings are between
the hub/brake-drum and the axle. There are two bearings, inner and outer,
and the front axle nut holds down a washer that squeezes on the bearings.
Notice that the front nut is smaller, since it just keeps the pieces together
Power is NOT transmitted through the joint the nut fastens.
	Note also that the bearing and its grease are exposed below the
nut, hence the dust cap.

	Everything on a front-wheel-drive car is the opposite because
the kind of bearings on a wheel have to do with whether the wheel transmits
power or just rolls freely. On a '62 that rear does power, the front
just rolls. On my Corrado, the front tranmits power and the rear just
rolls. Synchros have four big nuts and no dust caps, right Derek?

	Bill
