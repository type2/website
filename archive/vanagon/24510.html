Oregon is also the state that gave us the Oregon Citizen's Alliance, that
neo-nazi group that is (like a virus) attempting to infect neighboring
states.  But at least it gives Lon Mabon's family a job and keeps the whole
gang off welfare.

Ron, who likes the *state*, but not the rednecks who live there.
