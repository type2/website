Most of the exhaust plumbing for a '78 bus is obsolete.
VW dealers have few replacement parts for this system.

Find a '76 - '78 at the junkyard and take the parts that 
are still good.  

Make your own with the help of your favorite metal fabrication 
shop and the old parts/fittings as a jig.

Buy used or remanufactured parts from a smog parts dealer.

Since they know you're over a barrel when it comes to Calif
smog law compliance, there's one of the above that has really 
high price$.
