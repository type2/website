Gerald,

Really, the domestic in my 1984 makes ice. I thought that was normal.

        I get a kick out watching the station hand put three pounds of propane
in the tank and then turn and say it must be broken.  He usually says he
has never put so little propane in a vehicle. I just reasure him that it
Ok and give him $4 and drive away with a grin on my face.
        I NEVER had that kind of fun while driving a 35 foot class A motor
home.  The station hand was the one with the grin after pumping $150 in
gas and 50 pounds of propane.

I LOVE the VW life Style.

&gt; &gt; Hi Scott, having just come back from the maiden voyage with my 85 Westy I
&gt; &gt; can report that the fridge (and stove) worked perfectly on 12V and propane.
&gt; &gt; No noise, propane made ice cubes every day and moves between campsites at
&gt; &gt; 12V kept the fridge adwquately cold.
&gt; &gt; BTW, my fridge doesn't seem to work on 120V and given the way it works in
&gt; &gt; the other modes I'm not even going to try to fix it.
&gt;
&gt; You made ICE with a westy fridge?  Is it a Dometic just like the rest of us
&gt; have?  This is just about unheard of. Mine certainly would never make ice.
&gt; Where did you make ice? Didn't the rest of the food freeze too then?
