Joel.  Add another bus for me besides the '67.

I bought the '57 Deluxe 23-Window (Sunroof) last night!  I am so 
excited!  Picking it up this afternoon!!!

Is it true that the only paint combo in the early years was 
Chocolate/Salmon?  (what are the official names anyhow?)

Also true that '57 did not come with a gas guage?  (The fellow I 
purchased it from had one added.)
