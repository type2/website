Subject: RE: Stabilizer Arm

Mike:   There's coverage of this thread a year or more ago you might want
to search for.  Short form:  I never had any symptoms except a clunk from
time to time cornering, but the van's emergency handling is probably com-
promised until you fix it.  Having a machine shop drill and tap the broken
link for a 10mm bolt is lots cheaper than buying the new part from VW.
Before you put the new part in, make sure that the sleeve the bolt goes
thru is free to move in the control arm.  If it is frozen in one spot, the
new part will break in a matter of days.  Email me direct if this isn't
enough detail, and/or read more in the archives.
Good luck.
