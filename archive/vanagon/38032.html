Subject: 86 Vanagon CV boots replacement

My van has one torn CV boot. I was wondering is it an easy procedure to
replace. Which is the best replacement part (original VW or other) for the
money to get? Does the tire have to be removed? What tools are needed? Is
it easy to do a whole set of 4 at the same time. Thank you for any info.
