&gt;   That's true for the Awanhee &lt;sp?&gt; but not so for the campgrounds. They
&gt;   will take reservations only  6 or 8 weeks in advance and it is through
&gt;   Mistix &lt;aka Mistakes&gt;. A guy here at work just got reservations for Mother's
&gt;   Day in the Upper Pines campground &lt;in the valley, near Curry Village&gt; and 
&gt;   was trying to talk me into going.

Hmmm, last time I tried to get reservations for the valley campgrounds
(through ticketron) I had to do it a year in advance - I can't believe
things have actually gotten *easier*, but hey, I'm not complaining!
