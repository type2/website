&gt;     I've got an 85 Westy, and I'm curious if anyone's every cut out
&gt; the 'luggage rack' and installed a sunroof on one of these. I don't
&gt; need the extra space, and it would make summer driving a hell of a lot
&gt; better (no AC). Does this make any sense or is there some problem that
&gt; I'm overlooking?

Michael, I saw a Westfalia Vanagon last summer that had a sunroof AND  
the luggage rack in front. The owner had cut a square out of the center 
of the luggage rack and put in one of those glass/removable sunroofs. It 
wasn't a very sano installation, but not noticeable unless you looked in 
from above.
