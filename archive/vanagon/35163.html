&gt;Here's a mystery for ya folks.
&gt;
&gt;I rebuilt my 85 wasserboxer recently.  I've just put 1000 miles on it and
did
&gt;my first oil/filter change.  Pressure is good (48 lbs under load).  Temp is
&gt;fine.  The problem is I've been having to add a full quart of oil every tank
&gt;full of gas.  I'm getting about 250 miles to the tank.  When I did the oil
&gt;change, I found a VERY TINY oil leak from around the oil pressure sending
&gt;unit.  There was about a 2 inch puddle under the sending unit on the floor
&gt;after sitting overnight.
&gt;
&gt;I don't see any blue smoke and I just passed my emmissions test.  Results
&gt;are:
&gt;
&gt;Test       Standard    My test
&gt;CO%      1.20           0.22 
&gt;HC ppm  220            194
&gt;Dilution   6.00           13.32
&gt;rpm        1600           804
&gt;
&gt;I have since adjusted my idle to 950 but the oil loss/consumption is the
&gt;same.  Anyone have any ideas where my oil is going?

If you are not leaking it, you must be burning it.  Oil burners can pass smog
tests beleive it or not.  Let it break in further.  I would be concerned
about a broken piston ring or valve guides not properly fitted.  Especially
the intakes.  Make sure you are not over filling the crankcase.  Keep level
between the marks.  Never go above the top fill mark.
