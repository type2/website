&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Vanapeople!
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there some way I can get my pass. seat's arm rests back on!?!?  or
&gt;&gt;&gt; should I take it to a pro? what dya think they cost?!
&gt;
&gt;Arm rests turn on a post - they are held on the post with a hex-socket bolt
&gt;hidden beneath the round plastic cover, which easily pops off (and rolls
&gt;out the door).  The post bracket is attached to the seat with a few screws.
&gt;If the bracket is loose, you need to take of the arm to get access to the
&gt;screws.
&gt;
Don't know what year your van is, but for 87-91, the handy
roll-out-the-door cap has been eliminated.
