Subject: fellow brick trippers!


I am compiling a list of things people should consider bringing
along on this trek.  Have already incorporated the postings
regarding that in the past few days, and have several of my
own.  Anyone wanting to add anything to that list, just
e-mail me, and I'll keep track of it all and post it soon!
