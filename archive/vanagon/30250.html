Subject: Canadians: Q-beam



Q-beams are on sale at Canadian tire more 35$CDN for the 1,000,000 Candlepower.

I just picked one up...it is bright.  Actually, too bright for any of
the applications I can think of.  (ie, I'm stranded and what to signal
aircraft...I would blind the pilots:-)

They also have a 500,000 (unsure of brand) that runs off 12v, comes with an 
AC adapter, and has a small (20min) rechargable battery in it, for short
cordless applications.  I haven't looked at this one yet, but it sounds
like this one could be what I'm looking for.  It is 25$CDN.

I hope this sale isn't just local to Ottawa.

Um, by the way:
 I don't own the store or know anyone that works there.  (I used to know
a cashier there but she works somewhere else now.  Besides, I didn't even
like her that much.  I was friends with her boyfriend who I'm really not
that tight with anymore either.)
