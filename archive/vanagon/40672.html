Subject: temp and leak

Two questions for my experts.  1. why is the temperature gauge only 
going a quarter up instead of halfway?  2. had the heads replaced a 
a few months ago and last month had the two oil pressure switches  
replaced.  Now, a third leak developed.  VW says it is leaking from 
the oil cooler which is behind the oil filter.  The o rings must be 
replaced and its parts plus one and a half hours.  Does this sound 
correct?  tia  Sherwin
