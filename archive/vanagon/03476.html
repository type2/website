Subject: RE: Dunlops (was Silver Secret)

Regarding the Dunlop tires I bought when I couldn't find replacement
Michelins:

The sidewalls show:

Dunlop SP LT5 Tubeless
185R14  6 P.R. LT Load Range C
Steel Belted Radial
4 Plies Tread - 2 Polyester + 2 Steel
2 Plies Sidewall - 2 Polyester

Capacity 1600 Lbs. _at_ 50 PSI cold

Sorry about my previous smart-ass comment on the British.  Turns out
THESE Dunlops say &quot;Made In Japan&quot;.

The tires were actually IN STOCK at a local independent (but large) tire
store.  I think I paid about $80 each, including tax, mounting, stems,
dynamic off-car balancing, and old tire disposal fee.

Like I said, so far I am happy - they seem to be better than the OEM
Michelins.  The Michelins squealed a lot during sharp but low-speed turns
when inflated to the door-sticker pressures - the Dunlops don't.  The
Dunlops are also quieter on wet pavement, yet I haven't noticed any
hydroplaning or other traction problems.

I don't see the phrase &quot;reinforced&quot; on the sidewalls.  I can't remember if
the original (1982) Michelin's said &quot;reinforced&quot; either.  I DO know they
said Load Range C.
