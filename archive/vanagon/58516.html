Subject: Re: Twiga has new shoes [Tires] 

I assumed, like most of us on the list probably do, that the Westy has a
rear weight bias.  I was shocked to learn when I weighed my Westy that the
front axle was 2010 lbs and the rear axle was 2000!  Maybe on the regular
Vanagon there is a rear weight bias, but the only thing I can figure out is
that on the Westy the camping equipment changes this...

&gt;
&gt;This does not apply to the Eurovan or any other front engined vehicles
(except for a very 
&gt;small minority (front mid-engined)).

&gt;&gt;I would like to comment on the recommended psi your tire guy recommended:\
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;According to my tire guy - who I have used for some 12 years, with tires on
&gt;&gt;2 Westies and 3 toyotas (2 of the 4 x 4s) you should never inflate front and
&gt;&gt;rear the same. Front tires (and the vehicle specs) require lower inflation
&gt;&gt;than rear to prevent &quot;over steer.&quot; That is, loss of control in quick moves
&gt;&gt;especially! This could cause you to loose control and . . . .
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Just offering this info for what it is worth - but if your tire people
say &quot;40
&gt;&gt;psi all round&quot; I would have to question their expertise!
