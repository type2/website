Richard,
Jordan Lake sounds great to me. So count me in. I'll bring my '76 camper 
bulli LILA and maybe some other friends. I also would be willing to 
participate in a pre-organizing meeting either in Chapel Hill or 
Raleigh. I have camped several times at Jordan Lake and I always have 
had a great time there. BTW Jordan Lake has one of the largest bald eagle 
habitats in the US, so bring your binoculars if you want to see them up 
close.
