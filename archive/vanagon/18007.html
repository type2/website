&gt;For Sale:
&gt;
&gt;1973 VW Van
&gt;Less than 20,000 miles on new engine.  Clutch, transmission also new with
&gt;engine.  Brakes replaced less than 2,000 miles ago.  Interior good, except
&gt;for front seats.  Back seat folds into a bed.  Great for trips, camping,
&gt;etc.  Fun car, must see.  I am only parting with it because I am heading
&gt;back East in Mid June and don't think it would be great in the snow. 
&gt;Although it would make the trip fun.  Has fridge and sink in the back. 
&gt;Lots of storage space, and some real snazzy curtains.  Excellent running
&gt;condition, paint ok.  Almost no rust.  It's been a California car all of
&gt;its life.

Dude, rear wheel engine and drives are excellent in the snow, they climb
like snowcats.  Heat is the only issue.
