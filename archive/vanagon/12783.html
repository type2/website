So Douglas Henry says:
&gt; Hi  all:
&gt; 
&gt; system.  Error messages on the pressure sensor and the control unit, or
&gt; &quot;brain&quot;.  The analysis cost $90 for 1 1/2 hrs labor.
&gt; 
&gt; guaranteed, for a total of $75 from a junkyard.
&gt; 

Doug,

Congratulations on your fix and better judgement to seek parts at the
junk yard.  I'd say the $90 labor charge is not too bad of an investment
considering that you're driving the car sooner than you would've had
you tried to figure it out yourself.

Cheers!
