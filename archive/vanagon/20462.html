Volks,
	My parents are visiting me this weekend from Germany, and they told
me something about the Eurovan I didn't know (but should have
suspected).  They have a '94 Eurovan Westfalia (marcella red?) that has
a 2.0 4-cylinder with a 5 speed tranny!  They say they have no trouble
keeping up a steady 85 mph on the autobahn, even when loaded down with
camping stuff.  They also claim to be getting 26 mpg with this setup.
They recently drove it into the Arctic circle (up through Norway).  Are
you listening Martha?  :)  Just thought the different powertrain might
interest someone...
