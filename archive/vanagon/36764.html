I dismantled the door hinges. The hinge component is being re-bushed and new 
15mm silver steel rod will be used for the pins.

What surprised me about the original pin is that it has  a vertical channel 
drilled into the centre of the pin, into which fits what looks like a red 
dust cap.  It looks as though it's purpose is to provide oil to the hinge - 
but it doesn't because the channel doesn't go anywhere. With the  new pins, 
I am also drilling a horizontal channel to meet the bottom of the vertical 
channel so that an oil supply will reach the hinge faces - rather than 
soaking the whole unit in the hope that some oil will find its way to the 
right place.

Anybody got any experience of this?
