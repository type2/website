Subject: Geting wired and lit with the EV


A few weeks ago, I did a little surgery on the rear bumper to mount the rear 
fog light. Today I decided to play hookey to mount a pair of front fogs and 
put in the necessary wiring......

Four and one half hours later the EV/MV now has operational front and rear 
fogs! When I was in Germany two years ago I was quoted $300+ for the factory 
fogs that mount inside the bumper.....a bit too much $$$$ for me. So I 
scrounged a pair of Hella 210 fogs from my old rally car. The fogs are just 
slightly smaller than the headlights on the EV. I managed to mount them in 
the indentations where the factory fogs are supposed to go. Only one minor 
problem, I'll have to make a bracket inside the bumper for them as the 
bumper tends to flex a bit, and the fogs have a slight vibration....

Now I can have fun with those dweebs in their Bimmers and Mustangs who think 
its so kewl and bitchen' to drive around all the time with their fogs on 
(ZZZZZZAAAAPPPP...100w of white light!)...and actually be able to see in the 
rain and fog (the real purpose for fog lights) for our upcomming 
Massachusetts to Grand Canyon road trip!
