Here's a repost of some excellent information from Jim Davis...

Here's what I've been able to assemble on this trip:

Dates: 
Friday 4-26 to Monday 4-29 depending on how much time you want to spend
there.  I'm planning on arriving Friday night and leaving on Monday
afternoon.  Others may want to just do a Saturday/Sunday thing.

Location:
Red Rock Canyon State Park.  25 miles north of Mojave California, along CA
Highway 14.  Mojave is about 25 miles north of Lancaster.  OK, Lancaster is
about 70 miles north of Los Angeles vai I-5 and CA-14.  Los Angeles is...OK
you know that.
Elevation is 2600 feet and the southern stretches of the Sierras are just a
short van trip away.

The campground:
&gt;From &quot;California Camping, The Complete Guide&quot; by Tom Stienstra:
&quot;There are 50 campsites for tents or motor homes up to 30 feet long.  Piped
water, fireplaces, and picnic tables are provided.  Pit toilets, a dump
station, exhibits, and a nature trail are available.  Two camp[sites] are
wheelchair accessible.  Pets are permitted on leashes.

Reservations &amp; fee:
There are no reservations, just first come, first served.  Cost is $7/nite.
If the campround fills up (I don't know what the likelyhood of this is) there
is plenty of non-campground camping in the surrounding area - bring plenty of
water.

Nearby:
Mountain biking, 4x4 trails.  Also from &quot;California Camping, The Complete
Guide&quot; by Tom Stienstra: &quot;Easy access makes this a prime attraction, along
with the chance to see colorful rock formations.  A side trip for
geologicallt-oriented visitors or rock-hounds is the drive up Jawbone Canyon
Road in order to explore Jawbone and Last Chance Canyons.&quot;  I plan on a trip
to see and walk through the nearby &quot;Burro Schmidt's Tunnel - a mine dug
through one side of a mountain and out the other.

In camp activities:
I plan to bring horseshoes, frisbees, and other games &amp; sporting stuff to
amuse both me and my kids.  I'm planning for a family-oriented weekend.

Syncro Trip:
I plan to go on 1 or 2  4x4 outings with my 87 Syncro along with potential
accompanyment of some friends in Jeeps, a Pathfinder and a Blazer.  If you
plan to go on the off-road trip, please contact me and I'll send you a list
of suggested items to bring &amp; precautions to take.
