Subject: Re:  Battery for Vanagon



Regarding gel cells, there are some that are made for automobile use.  
They are just like the old lead-acid, in that they are 12 volt and have 
the same terminal set up so you can just swap them with your current 
battery.  They also make an excellent interior battery for using when 
camping, since they don't give off any toxic gases.
