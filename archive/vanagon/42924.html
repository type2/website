Subject: Re: Cheap 86 Syncro Westie?



&gt;In today's San Jose Mercury (first time advertised)
&gt;
&gt;VW '86 Syncro cmpr, new eng $4850  (415) 493-0841
&gt;
&gt;Joel?

Called the owner. Not exactly a Westy, but sounds like a pretty 
good deal.  Original owner, 130k miles, Country Homes straight-up 
pop-top but standard Vanagon interior other than bed in pop-top.  
Motor was recently rebuilt by a local VW specialist.  No A/C.  4 
speed.  Good running condition.  Blue.  If it was a Westy, I would 
have bought it, but I need the full camper interior, so I'll stick 
with my '85.
