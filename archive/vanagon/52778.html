RE:	Copy of: Re: Dead Deer on a Syncro

Hi, James, 
Let's just get this straight.... I'm not a &quot;animal right's activist&quot;  I was just
remarking that it was just kind of unpleasant to see a dead deer hanging off a
car. I find roadkills just as unappealing. When I was younger I used to go
hunting w/ my grandfather myself.  I've had quite a few &quot;close calls&quot; too, and I
used to work part time at a body shop a few years ago, and have seen what a deer
can do to a car.  I guess as more new development of their natural habitats
increases, especially in rural woodand areas like that in N.E.  P.A., then this
problem will rise. Too bad there is no real solution. Hunters don't even really
make a &quot;dent&quot; in their population. I have read some study that said in the last
10 years, the  deer population is actually increasing.
