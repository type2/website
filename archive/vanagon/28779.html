Subject: 70 Westie &amp; 75 Adventurewagon _at_ wreckers, VW giveaways

	Friends,
	VW Used Parts Center, 1745 Villa Stone Drive, 408 294 5210
open 10-6 Tuesday-Saturday, had two T2 campers in their front yard
when I drove by today- a '70 Non-pop-top Westfalia with sink/fridge,
folding table, curtains, pretty good looking orange plad interior, 
rear-ward facing seat instead of a stove. 

	The body has terminal cancer rust and the front seats
are basicly worn out. No engine, but almost all the signal-lamps and
so forth were present. The grab-strap to the left of the side door
was broken, so I think the interior is probably original and whomever
wore out the front seats did a lot of driving it, as opposed to camping,
in it.
	Also present was a much sadder looking '75 Adventurewagon. 
Interior mostly gone, just the fold-down rear seat, and of course the
big top. Bunch of greasy junk in the center of the floor, but the big
top looked to be in good shape. 

	These guys normally dismantle and store everything, they
have piles of heads, cases, brake drums, etc. This was where I got my
air-cleaner support already cut out of a chassis... so they may well
remove and store the Westy interior. Hard to say. 

	I've got no connection with them, I was just hoping
to find some used heater boxes since the control arms for both of
mine are BROKEN OFF. I thought about buying a welder and decided
it was smarter ($50 verses $350) to buy a second set of heater boxes
and fix mine or give them to someone deserving. I can inquire on the
price for Westy interior parts when I repeat my trip tomorrow, since
they're not open Mondays. :)

	I called VW (1-800-444 VWUS) last week and asked for some current
literature and the Jerry Garcia memorial art. I got the art, in a
separate mailer that cost 'em $2.35, today. Just the cartoon splitie
with the tear and Jerry's name and dates. Subtle, pretty, I'm not a big
Dead head, I may give it to someone who is, or keep for my cannonical
memorabilia collection. I've been listening to a lot of Bela Fleck and 
the Flecktones this weekend and I think are at least as good bus band as
the Dreadful Grate-  not trying to start a flame, just opening some 
alternatives. I like Jerry ok, but I worship the 'Tones. And with 
no lyrics, I find I can let the view out the window supply the meaning :)

	Speaking of bus music, The Mermen will be playing a benefit
for KFJC on Saturday, December 16, 1995, 7:00 pm, almost certainly in 
room F-12 of Foothill College. $10 at the door and bring four quarters 
for parking. I plan  to be there wearing my very cool Netvernugen tee shirt. 
Other Bay Area bussers wanna meet for Pizza before hand? I expect the
show will be broadcast as the Phil Dirt show, live, so tune to 89.7 if
you want to check 'em out. Psychedelic surf music. Excellent for the
more stoked bus owner/operator/mechanic/investor...

	Happy motoring!
	Bill
