&gt;&gt; As seen in today's Minneapolis Star-Tribune:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; '93 VW EUROVAN MV
&gt;&gt; Hard to find 7 pass 5 spd w/dual air/tilt, cass, rear bed,
&gt;curtains, table,
&gt;&gt; etc!  Sale $17,995.  Schmeltz Countryside VW.  (612) 484-8441.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; All the usual disclaimers apply.  Never even been to this
&gt;delearership.

&gt;
&gt;We ping-ponged between Coutryside and West Side VW to get best price
&gt;on _our_ 
&gt;'93 Eurovan &quot;7 pass 5 spd w/dual air/tilt, cass, rear bed, curtains,
&gt;table, 
&gt;etc!&quot; The price in this ad looks high; we paid $18,500 for what seems
&gt;like the 
&gt;same model (w/o 'tilt'--if that means &quot;tilt steering&quot;) with 12K miles
&gt;on it in 
&gt;May of '94. Much as I'd like to believe otherwise, this model has to
&gt;have 
&gt;depreciated more than $505 since then!
&gt;
&gt;The salesman at Countryside gave us a little note with a &quot;One Day
&gt;Only--bottom 
&gt;line price, we're having a contest this month&quot; line. We took his
&gt;little notey 
&gt;and left for West Side, where we found and bought our van (same model
&gt;sans auto)
&gt;for about $1000 less.
&gt;
&gt;My dad and I have been buying VWs from West Side for years (Dad: one
&gt;rabbit, 
&gt;three golfs--one a diesel, a Quantum Wagon, a Passat Wagon; Me: a
&gt;Scirocco, Golf
&gt;and the current Eurovan). 
&gt;
&gt;I think the service department there is the most honest I've seen
&gt;anywhere. 
&gt;Good, solid guys, straight shooters (at least in our experience). We
&gt;buy cars 
&gt;from Bob Tusnia--nice enought guy, been there for many years. West
&gt;Side seems to
&gt;stay away from the worst sort of sales hype, and most of the sales
&gt;staff has 
&gt;been there for life (probably a good sign in the car business).
&gt;
&gt;I notice this ad Brad quotes says &quot;tilt&quot; -- does that mean &quot;tilt
&gt;steering?&quot; 
&gt;Never seen it on a Euro Van, but I wish we had it. My wife and I both
&gt;get stiff 
&gt;necks, shoulders and backs on long drives....

I just called about this MV and asked about the &quot;tilt&quot;.  The salesman I
talked to, John somebody, told me to remember the name and I didn't, said
that it had to be a misprint as no Eurovan has a tilt steering wheel.  He
then went into the whole thing about how it was sold there new, hadbeen
serviced there on a regular basis and that the only reason it was traded was
that the PO saw an MV on the lot with a pop-top and the one they had didn't.
 It also doesn't have the cooler under the seat.
