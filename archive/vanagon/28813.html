&gt; anybody know if you can drive all the way to Churchill, in Ontario, on

Ummm.  Driving on Hudson's bay is probably dangerous with anything
other than a dogsled or snowmobile... I'd rather take roads.  :)

Also, Churchill is in Manitoba, not Ontario.

&gt; 
&gt; of course, even in the summer, it might still be frozen in ... 

No, It gets yo be above freezing for a few months in the summer, but
the mosquitos are pretty nasty, it's not pleasant untill it gets down
near freezing.

&gt; or still
&gt; surrounded by polar bears (which, by the way, are just about the same size
&gt; as a vw bus!). :)

Yes, they are around all fall, winter and spring, and occaisionally in
the summer, but they tend to stay outta town when it's above freezing,
the garbage dump is thawed and they hang around it like mall rats.

Not quite as big Volumetrically... But the big ones are more massive.
They crush the roofs in on small cars when they walk over them.


&gt; 
&gt; just a thought.

I've never been to Churchill (But I've been to one healthy) but my 
father has been many times in the summer, and a friend of mine spent
a few years there as a kid (you should hear his Polar Bear stories).
