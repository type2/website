&gt;Right to the problem: Every time I exit the freeway, the oil pressure

&gt;stopped the engine, and checked the oil (always fine). I turn the engine 
&gt;on again after a minute or two and everything is fine (no light, no

&gt;freeway? 8-) Any advise of information is appreciated.

I had exactly the same problem with my '91. It turned out to be the oil
pressure relief check ball was sticking causing chronic low oil pressure.
The pressure was always low, but within spec, so the buzzer/light didn't
go off until it got very low like in the summer, when running 10W-30, etc.,
etc., and when I hit an exit ramp, just like Patrick. My dealer replaced
the check ball and spring and it's been perfect since.

I should point out that the dealer I bought the Vanagon from screwed
around with replacing the dynamic oil pressure system circuit board,
put on a VW oil filter, and then scratched his head and said &quot;duh?&quot;.
The dealer I use now swapped out the oil pressure sending unit then
zeroed in on the check ball.

Good luck, Patrick! I'll bet you a beer it's the check ball and spring.
