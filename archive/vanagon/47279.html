Subject: Greed intervenes on behalf of the EV.....


On my way into the office I stopped by to see the Syncro Westie and talk =
to the seller. During our talk, he mentioned someone stopping by with =
greenbacks in hand and offering $1k more than I did. So he said he'd =
keep our deal as long as I came up with cash in 48 hrs....I told him I'd =
need a week to sell the EV...

The end result...the EV is staying in the fleet. Can't blame the seller, =
I'd probably do the same thing...as they say: &quot;money talks...bullshit =
walks&quot;...
or at least drives away in an EV  ;-)

....did I mention the Ferrarri 308 I saw today? I wonder if the owner =
wants to trade even for the EV...   only kidding!!
