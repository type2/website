ahh, the shallow persuit of vanity...  you're in good company.

&gt; 
&gt; As you guys already know, the 85 Vanagon has the round headlights.  I 
&gt; however, love the German look of the rectangular lights.  Any tips on 
&gt; such a facelift?

pause to consider:
first off, having owned both types i have to admit to liking the 
looks of the rectangulars better.  and the high beams are great.  
BUT....

from an optical standpoint, you can get some outstanding 7&quot; round
headlights.  the low beams on my rectangulars suck.  these high-end
7&quot; rounds also have a very 'Euro' look to them which is obvious to
the trained eye (and to heck with the rest of the madding crowd, i
might add).  additionally, if your rounds get pasted by a rock,
replacement is cheap and available.

also, rock guards are readily available for the rounds and look kewl 
(that is the first time i've ever used that word, i swear) IMHO.  
maybe even look sano or bitchin' but i wouldn't be qualified on to 
make that judgement.
