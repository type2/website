So Christopher Bridge says:
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks-
&gt; a couple of things- $650 was what I haggled her down to.
&gt; how do I know the trannys' condition If it doesn't have a good engine.
&gt; Right now It's sitting in a FLAR yard.  (where she had it towed after it 
&gt; seized.)
&gt; They told her 1500 to put a engine in it.  They also know who has been 
&gt; working on it.  
&gt; Thanks.

Well, in a nutshell, ya don't know.  But it probably is okay.  But don't
be suprised if it has problems.  If she had it towed for the engine, then
chances are the tranny is still good.  Heed the advice of the other poster
(Todd I think) who answered your post.  I just assumed that you had been 
reading the list and had narrowed down your choice of VW you wanted.  I 
agree with him that the bus can be a can-o-worms, but they are still 
relatively cheap to maintain and are quite a joy to own.
