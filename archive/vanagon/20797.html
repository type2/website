Subject: Van names...


Our white EV MV has been alternately called &quot;Moby Van&quot;...the
great white van...

and when we have all the kids and their associated stuff in it..
&quot;Mommy Van&quot;.


Didja ever notice how EuroVans (and I'm sure other VW vans) seem
to run &quot;happy&quot; when its hauling the family and out on the
highway? Mine does!
