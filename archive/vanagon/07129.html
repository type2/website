Subject: '56 Kombi Update - Rockers and Undercoating

Howdy!

	Got the outer rocker panel on the passenger side welded up, and then
started doing some cleaning on the underbelly.  This made for a nice diversion
while I try to figure out how exactly to solve a couple of minor problems
that've come up with trying to put the outer rocker on.  My SO has been 
working on the finishing bodywork on the driver's side.  Just a little
more wleding on the driver's side - gotta fix a miscalculated trimming...

	I also accomplished an almost impossible feat - i got my SO to crawl
under the bus with a wire brush and help with the cleaning!  There is a lot
of light surface rust, and a few minutes with of elbow grease with a 
wire brush takes it off and reveals the paint!  I then undercoat it.

	I started using the Permatex undercoating, and then switched to Wesley's
tonight 'cause thats all I could find.   I actually like the Wesley's better,
it seems to go on easier, and to be a little less susceptible to chipping.
I'll prolly do the rest of the belly with it, now.  It took three cans to do
one half, not including the very farthest back region nor under the farthest
front area.  And I haven't even touched the wheen wells!

	When I'm done with this part, this is going to be one spiffy under-
carriage!  And NO rust!
