Everybody, 
 My mother used to say, &quot;If you don't have anything VW related to say,
then don't say anything at all&quot;...or something like that...maybe it was,
&quot;People who live in pop-top houses shouldn't throw SPAM???&quot; Well I
forget the _exact_ maternal wisdom, but I think that you get my point. 

 Soooo, unless someone can explain how discussing(bickering about)
copyrights, racism and the EPA can make me have more Fahrfegnugen(sp?)
then I will forgive the unnecessary e-mail that I have to wade through
every night. 
 
 In other words, unless it's about VeeDubs, DON'T TOUCH THOSE KEYS!!! 
***********************************************************************************

 Because I don't like wasting bandwidth like this, I'll end with a
question that I've had recently. 
 I'm upgrading my front seats to the newer armrest style and I've
noticed that when they are in the door doesn't close because of the
door's arm rest. On the vans that these seats were intended for, did VW
just leave off the door's arm rest, or was there a narrower/different
one that I'll have to track down?

 Oh, also to whomever posted the question about the rear oil filler
door, I finally got around fiddling with the springs, and although there
isn't really an easy way to disconnect them completely without breaking
or bending something, you can use a flat-head screwdriver to push the
hooked-end down over the corner of the bracket so that it has MUCH less
tension. Like, so that just the weight of a screwdriver or a package of
Twinkies can hold it down. The nice thing is that you can put them right
back later, like if you want to sell the van. 
 Warning, don't eat the Twinkies if you accidentally spill oil on them
unless of course, it's synthetic oil which has a very similar chemical
make-up to most Hostess snack cakes.

 If you respond to this post, it should be about seats or oil filler
doors and maybe even Twinkies, but absolutely NO SPAM! Twinkies don't go
with SPAM! Yuck!  :)

Thanks, 

Noel
