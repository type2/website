Subject:      Re: Tires for 91 westy - options?

Hello Jahan.  I'm a big Yoko Y370 fan.  I'm on my third set right
now on my Syncro Westy.  My last set was purchased about a month ago.
 Interesting comment from your tire dealer about this tire not being
good for the Westy. I beg to differ.  Exceptional stability, low
noise, tremedous grip on pretty much all conditions.  It doesn't get
better IMHO.  My dealer (Vancouver, BC) had no trouble getting me a
new set Y370 LT's when I asked for them, so they are still available
in Canada.

Hope this helps,
Harry.

&gt;        The tire dealer said the Yoko Y370 has been replaced by the
&gt;        SD05, otherwise known as the &quot;Super Digger&quot; for $71. The name
&gt;        Super Digger conjures images of an aggressive tread pattern,
&gt;        and howling tire noise on the Interstate as a result. A call
&gt;        to Yokohama HQ to confirm the demise of the Y370, a perennial
&gt;        listserv favorite, has yet to be returned.
&gt;
&gt;        The tire dealer said the Y370's 195/75R14 is not the
&gt;        recommended aspect ratio for a top-heavy Westy, and that
&gt;        185/80R14 or 205/70R14 are the only suitable choices. He said
&gt;        he's seen two Westys with the Y370s where the tire had
&gt;        separated. He wasn't too hip on these, as you can surmise.

&gt;        Does anyone know if the Yokohama Y370 is still available?
&gt;
&gt;        Does anyone have any other recommendations that are less
&gt;        expensive, and/or better than the Michelins?
&gt;
&gt;        If you respond directly to me, I will gather up the responses
&gt;        and post the findings to the group.
