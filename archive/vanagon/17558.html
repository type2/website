&gt; Sorry if I'm jumping into the middle of an already discussed topic, but 
&gt; is the &quot;2 liter&quot; a souped up type 1 or a real 2 liter FI pancake ?
&gt; 
   Its a real type 4, 2 litre engine. No FI though.

&gt; My real question:
&gt; 
&gt; I'd be really interested to know if anyone has put a Bug engine into a 
&gt; '76-'79 Bus. Or alternatively, '76-'79 Westfalia camper components on a 
&gt; '68-'71  Bus.
&gt; 
  I've seen a super beetle (1600) engine in a '76 bus. Goes great.

&gt; I love my 2.0 liter, but It makes me uncomfortable in Mexico/CA. Any 
&gt; experiences ?                          ^^^^^^^^^

  why uncomfortable?????

  cheers
