So David Garth says:
&gt; 
&gt; Hi all.
&gt; 
&gt; I've camped a lot in the highway 395 area, and I personally don't like 
&gt; Red Rock that much. Very barren and dry looking.
&gt; 
&gt; Nearby, and at a higher elevation, is another Forest Service Campground 
&gt; called Lone Pine Campground; it's on the road to Whitnet Portal. This 
&gt; place is gorgeous! Fabulous views from almost every camp site.
&gt; 
&gt; If we're going this far, why not go to a prettier (and cooler) place?
&gt; 

When it's that far away, it doesn't really matter.  Is the Red Rock 
area warm this early in Spring?  After Pfieffer, I wouldn't mind
a little dry. ;)
