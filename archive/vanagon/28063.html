Subject: Coolant System Warning to 86+ Owners

I came across a reference in the archives to a cooling system flange problem
and want to flag this to (at least) 86 vanagon owners...and probably several
later years.  On the 86, a cooling hose enters the engine block under the
alternator through a plastic flange. (See Bentley p19.14--lower right of the
diagram with the 20 Nm designation.) This flange easily snaps off if any of
the drive belts break.  VW apparently discovered this problem and has a
replacemnt flange 025 121 160D made from steel which apparently solves the
problem. 

As best I can tell from Bentley the equivalent to this part on the 1983-85
models was made of metal.  My Bentley does not go past 1986, but I assume VW
changed to the metal replacement sometime after 1986.  I recommend (from
painful experience five years ago) that you check to see if you have the
plastic or metal version.  If you have the plastic version, order the metal
replacement (about $10 with new o ring as I remember) and at least carry it
with you until your next coolant change when it can be easily installed.

I was extremely fortunate that mine broke while in the St Louis region and
that one (of the then half dozen dealers in the metro area) actually had the
replacement part in stock.  You clearly risk major engine damage driving
with this part of the cooling system not functioning.
