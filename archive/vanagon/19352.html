So Derek one-cell-short-of-a-6-pack Drew says:
&gt; 
&gt; Problem solved.
&gt; 
&gt; It is *really* cool to have a digital ammeter, by the way. I want one in the
&gt; dash to measure the amps at each battery, and coming out of the alternator.
&gt; 
&gt; VDO has a really nice looking Night Design model, but it is not digital.

I can see Derek romping around in the culverts and over rock piles bigger than
most houses and then having a breakdown exclaiming, &quot;Well, it's not the batteries,
there at 13.6V and only drawing 1.5 amps!&quot;  ;p   ;)

Carry on Drew, you always breaking new ground for me.  :)
