Subject: LT Crew Cab  (was Re: Cool Transporter Picture)

&gt; Hi all: I was just thumbing through the new VW Trends (march 97) and on
&gt; page 81 there is a picture of a three door Transporter all painted up
&gt; for Rallye use. The article is about the cars in the VW museum. I would
&gt; like to see a clearer shot of the transporter and it's history would be
&gt; interesting.   Todd Francis

That's an LT series Crew Cab. LT35, LT40  etc. Not a Vanagon Crew. (Todd, don't
you have a Vanagon crew cab?)
Mid mounted diesel engine. (the engine sits between the driver, and the
passenger in the cab.)
Comes in all different configurations, just like the V-gon commercial series. 
I think this is the biggest truck series that VW offers. 
There's a guy locally who has a LT35 motorhome with a full bathroom!!....a tad
bigger than the Westy I must say...........(it's for sale too, but I think he
wants between  5 and 8 grand for it.)
