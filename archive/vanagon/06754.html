	Been a good week for my bus!

	Tuesday I finally wrapped my mitts around a 3rd-brake-light engine
lid!  YESS!  I also got a crank-start apron.  For the uninitiated, the
early busses, like to '57 (methinks) had a crank start option.  The rear
apron has a slot in it for the crank to go thru.  I don't know how well
this'll work with the 1600 motor I'm going to put in it, but I have 
considered going back to a 36hp some day in the distant future.  The apron
has a little bit of surface rust, and looks like it was stepped on and bent
back in one spot, but is pretty clean all things considered.  The engine
lid is a tad rusty, especially in the lower corners.  It will require some
surgery.

	Then, I got my new inner-rocker panels today!  Couldn't wait, so
I sneaked out of the office at the first opportunity and got busy!  I had
to cur the old ones off with tin snips 'cause my saw wouldn't reach, and then
I cleaned everything up as best as I could, even going as far as painting
the inside of the outriggers with rustoleum.  There was a little surface
rust, but not too bad.  

	I guess I should mention I've only worked on the driver's side so far.

	I went ahead and welded in the inner rocker, at least partially anyway.
I welded the inside portions where it contacts the outriggers and floor
supports.  MIG is fun!

	I got the inner rockers from Das Bulli Haus, and they're made by Alan
Schofield.  They fit perfectly except that I had to bend the tabs on the end
myself, cause the came straight.  The big bonus on these babies is they're
galavized!  I paid $23 each plus $20 shipping (UPS)

	I also picked up new windshield seals ($30/set) 

	The whole fandango took about 5 hours, including cleanup afterwards.
Even missed a pretty good electrical storm :(

	Sunday I'm gonna work on the windsheilds some more.  I went ahead and
primered over the Duro Extend I put on it, but I don't think the primer is
reacting well with it, making these funny looking cracks when it dried.  
I'll prolly have to sand the whole mess back off again... :(

	Next items will include finding bumpers and finishing the nose.  And of
course, the outer driver rocker and the passenger side rocker panels!

	Until next time...

Thom
