&gt;I just get into the Syncro's newsgroup and it's really interesting.
&gt;As an happy owner of a 16&quot; TD Vanagon GL Syncro - with Oettinger engine and
&gt;intercooler - which is called in France Caravelle GL, I'd like to know more
&gt;about the US Syncros. Here are a few questions :
&gt;
&gt;- Do the US Syncro come with front and rear differential block as in Europe
&gt;or only with rear block?

USA Vanagons had the front differential lock as an option in 1986, 87, and
89.  Then for 1990 &amp; 1991 the rear lock was standard equipment.  VW did not
sell any Vanagon Syncros in the USA with the fron differential lock.

&gt;- Is it possible to get turbo diesel Syncro from the US?

Not unless you build it yourself.  All USA Syncros had 2.1L gasoline
&quot;wasserboxer&quot; engines, as did all USA Vanagons from 1986 to 1991.

&gt;- Does anybody knows if there are a lot of differences between US and
&gt;European Syncro?

In Europe I've heard they cam with front differential locks and turbodiesel
engines.  :)
Seriously, I do understand thet Europe was offered several engines and other
options, while USA bound Syncros were all quite similar.  VW also sold the
Vanagon Camper Syncro and Vanagon Camper GL Syncro, both Westfalia
conversions.

&gt;In France, people prefer to get diesel engines because of the stupid price
&gt;of the gas. Well, taxes... We are like you guys, we hate them! A gallon of
&gt;gas is between 4.5 and 5 bucks... Can you believe this?

While gasoline is one of the most taxed products here in the USA, the taxes
are not even close to what most of Europe pays.  Right now, gas costs about
$1.30/gallon and about $0.40 of that is tax.

&gt;There is a club in France which is called Syncro Club. There are about 70
&gt;members. If you know somebody who might be interested by that, we can share
&gt;informations about parts, specs, etc. The problem is that I'm the only
&gt;member who is wired to Internet. We Froggies are kind of low to get in these
&gt;electronic stuff...

That would be GREAT!!!  I have a list of email addresses of about 110 Syncro
owners worldwide - mostly in the USA.  Many subscribe to the Vanagon list.

&gt;So you can email me if you want to. I'd appreciate it. And I think one day
&gt;I'll get a Syncro from the US, they are usually in better shape than the
&gt;Europeans.

Good luck &amp; nice to hear from you!
