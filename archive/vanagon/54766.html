&gt;For those of you with Eurovans in the US, what kind of fuel
&gt;economy do you get city/highway?  Is yours manual or auto tranny?
&gt;Also, what is the cruise range?  Are you happy with the power?
&gt;
With an automatic:
City(hilly, Sport mode switch &quot;on&quot;): 16-17
Highway (75mph) 20-22
Cruise range 280+, but since the fuel gauge seldom works I
usaully stop no further than 250 after fillup.
Power is OK, but I'd love to have a VR6 in it. I'd even
settle for the new VR5!
