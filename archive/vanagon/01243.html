Avoiding Meltdown
by Michael Packard

The ultimate perfomance test for the RV absorption refrigerator occurs
when ambient temperatures are very high.  Absorption refrigerators are
silent, can withstand the rigors of highway travel and use far less
energy to transfer heat than compressor-type units, but, unlike the
latter, they are limited to about a 50- to 60-degree difference between
outside and inside temperatures.

Here, we will give you some tips that can help improve efficiency and
examine some of the reasons why refrigerator compartment temperatures
can get unacceptably high.  We will briefly explain the absorption
theory, the three requirements for proper operation, how to perform
some preventive-maintenance inspections and how to troubleshoot the
LP-gas system and electrical components.

In order to get the best performance, start the refrigertor operations
several hours before a trip, and do this with it empty.  Pre-cool all
food that is to be transferred to the RV.  Similarly, frozen food should
be frozen prior to its transfer.   If possible, purchase cold food for
refrigerator storage.  Wipe condensation, if any, from whatever food
will be placed in the RV fridge.  Refrain from lining the shelves with
aluminum foil, which will restrict airflow.  Also, try not to leave the
door open any longer than is absolutely necessary.

Current models aren't as sensitive to leveling as older models, though.
For example, Norcold maximum off-level limits for the refrigerator
itself are 6 degrees front-to-rear and 3 degrees side-to-side.  If you
can, park the RV with the refrigerator side vent in the shaded area to
avoid the heat of afternoon sun.  When very hot weather is expected,
place some refreezable blue ice-type containers in the freezer overnight,
and then place them in the upper part of the refrigerator compartment
during the hot part of the day.  This will slow down the temperature
gain and may keep the food cold all day.  Also, in hot weather use
120-volt shore power if it's available, instead of propane.

All RVers, especially full-timers, should make it a regular practice to
defrost the refrigerator.  Excessive frost buildup on the evaporator
fins will inhibit the proper heat transfer.

Before you start troubleshooting, you need to understand the theory
behind the appliance.  The cooling unit consists of pipes that contain
the refrigerant mixture of ammonia, water, hydrogn, and sodium chromate,
an anticorrosive chemical.  A heat source from either the LP-gas burner
or an electric heating element is necessary for circulation of the
refrigerant through the tubing.  Similar to a coffee percolator, the
ammonia and water boil and rise up the pump tube where the water
separates and returns to the boiler.  Since ammonia does not condense
as quickly as water, this gas continues to rise to the condenser where
it expels its heat.  Next, the ammonia gas returns to a liquid state
and trickles down through the low-temperature evaporator located in the
freezer compartment.  This is where the hydrogen and pure ammonia meet.
Here, the evaporation process is greatest and the majority of the heat
is removed.  Remember, cold is simply the absence of heat.

Due to quick evaporation, the liquid ammonia becomes a gas again and
circulates to a high-temperature evaporator located in the refrigerator
section where more heat is absorbed from the food items stored there.
This gas then flows by gravity through a pipe to recombine with the
water to begin the process again, which is why sufficient leveling is
to be observed.  Because the &quot;absorbed&quot; heat must also be eliminated,
one of the most important elements for successful refrigerator
performance is adequate ventilation.

Most coaches have a side vent and a roof vent that must be inspected in
order to maximize heat dissipation, which is more critical in high
ambient temperatures.  We should note here that any inspection and
cleaning of the vents should take place only after the refrigerator has
been turned off for several hours.

The roof vent should be removed, if possible.  It's usually secured
with screws, or the cap is held down to the base assembly with metal
clips.  (Note: Some newer models have nonremovable top vents.)  This
will let you view the opening and the condenser.  It's not uncommon to
find bird nests, leaves and other debris in this area.  For those of
you who store your unit for extended periods of time, this inspection
is very important.  Fires have occurred in coaches when the refrigerator
was turned on if there was combustible debris on top of the burner
exhaust that had lodged in this area over time.  Also look for insulation
that has fallen down in the flue area.

After removing all the larger particles, you should be able to see the
side vent opening as you look down through the roof cavity.  At this
time, you can blow out the smaller particles, dirt and debris using
compressed air with the side vent either removed or propped open if it
is hinged.  The side vent is louvered, and there should be no screen
or filter material or anything else attached to the inside of this
assembly that would obstruct airflow.

Make sure that the louvers are open and not smashed down.  This is
critical because they serve as the intake air supply for the refrigerator.
In order for a draft to be created to expel the heat upward through the
roof vent, the temperature of this air must be lower than that which
exists in the back of the refrigerator.  Greater differences in these
temperatures will increase the amount of draft.

In a coach I used several years ago, I installed a battery-powered fan,
which was mounted on the wood platform at the left rear of the
refrigerator, and i experienced a documented improvement of 5 to 8
degrees in the refrigerator section.  I would only turn this fan on in
ambient temperatures higher than 90 degrees F.  Believe me, there is
a significant difference between 42 degrees and 50!  Nicro Solar
(2065 W. Avenue 140th Street, San Leandro, California 94577) offers a
similar solar-powered fan that functions similarly without battery drain.

Also, the interior light is DC and will have a 400- to 800-milliamp
draw to power the control, the interior light and the &quot;climate-control,&quot;
or high-humidity operation function.  This feature can help in high
humidity ambient temperature operation because it heats the metal frame
around the front of the refrigerator to help prevent condensation from
developing.  During extended periods of storage, turn this switch off
along with the interior light to prevent parasitic drains to the
battery.

Other ways to maximize hot weather performance include checking the
door gasket for proper sealing.  Insert a dollar bill around all four
corners of the door frame and gasket.  When you pull on the bill, there
should be some resistance all the way around, indicating the seal is
acceptable.  Also, make sure the interior light shuts off when you close
the door.  This added heat will create higher refrigerator temperatures
and battery drain.

The following procedures should be performed by qualified repair
technicians, but are provided to allow the owner to understand what is
done.  Begin by first turning the manual gas-control knob to the OFF
postion.  After the roof vent has been removed, the flame spreader or
flue spiral baffle can be removed.  It is attached to a wire and hooked
to the top of the exhaust vent.  The burner shoudl either be removed or
covered with cloth before you clean the flue.  A flue brush can be used
for this cleaning, such as a shotgun bore brush.  Run the brush tip up
and down through the flue to remove rust and soot.  The flame spreader
can also be cleaned and should be reinstalled at this time, along with
the roof vent.

Additional LP-gas components can be accessed through the side vent: the
burner assembly, the orifice and the thermocouple or electrode assembly.
Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions.  The burner and
orifice can be removed and cleaned with compressed air and denatured
alcohol.  Do not use a wire or drill to clean the orifice.  In newer
electronic-ignition designs, the electrode assembly can be carefully
cleaned of any carbon, which sometimes lodges on the tip of the electrode.
The electrode porcelain housing should be examined for cracks.  The
electrode spark gap must be set at a maximumn of 3/16 inch, which is
the distance between the electrode tip and the burner.  With these
components reinstalled, the LP-gas pressure can now be checked.

A pressure tap can be removed and the line pressure measured with a
manometer (U-tube gauge).  Those of you who want to perform this test
should be thoroughly familiar with LP-gas safety and understand these
readings.  The input-line pressure for all LP-gas appliances is 11
inches WC (water-column).  Your RV-dealership's service center should
be equipped to perform this test.  However, for the do-it-yourselfer
these tools can be ordered from a variety of sources; your RV-parts
store can sell you one or order one for you.

Furthermore, a commercial leak-detection solution designed for checking
LP-gas connections and fittings should be used.  Use the dauber that
comes in the bottle to soak down the fittings and look for any bubbles,
which indicate a leak is present.  Do not get any of this solution on
the components of the control system of the refrigerator.

A note about safety should be mentioned here.  Do not store any
combustible materials or flammable liquids in the refrigerator
compartment.  Also, when refueling with gasoline, diesel, or LP-gas,
make sure the refrigerator is turned off, as well as the furnace and
water heater.  Since these appliances are externally vented, fuel vapors
could be ignited, causing a fire that could result in personal injury
or property loss.

During hot weather, units without automatic thermostats must be turned
up to MAX in the daytime.  Many older models have a high- and low-flame
feature on gas mode, while the newer designs feature a thermostat that
will turn the flame off when the target temperature is reached.  When
more cold is called for, it will start a sequence of electronic
ignition and cycle back on.  If the thermostat is suspect, it can be
bypassed by hooking the leads together with electrical tape.  If the
refrigerator begins operating, replace the thermostat.

The electrical system heating element is what creates the heat source
for electric operation.  Here, a volt/ohmmeter is required for testing.
The correct voltage and wattage rating of the heater is vital to create
sufficient heat to circulate the cooling-unit refrigerant.  If this is
compromised in any manner, the refrigerator performance will be less
than ideal or perhaps result in no cooling at all.

Adhere to all safety precautions when working with electrical components.
With the electrical power turned off, disconnect the heater leads and
measure for proper resistance across the leads.  If the resistance is
infinite, the unit is defective.  To determine the correct ohm-resistance
value for your particular refrigerator model, contact the manufacturer
or your RV service center.

If these readings are within specifications, reconnect the heater leads.
Make sure you observe the correct polarity and that after you turn the
electrical power back on, that power is present at the receptacle the
refrigerator cord is plugged into.

In newer models with electronic ignition and automatic energy selection,
a fair amount of battery power is required for the control to function.
The incoming battery voltage can be checked at the terminal block at the
rear of the refrigerator;  there should be between 10.5 and 13.5 volts DC.

If chronic hot-weather performance problems exist, there is a possibility
the ventilation area created behind the refrigerator by the RV manufacturer
is not large enough.  Ask the refrigerator manufacturer for specifications,
measure the ventilation area on your unit, and see if it meets the
specifications.  In most cases, RV manufacturers adhere to the refrigerator
design specifications.

In summary, proper operation can result in better efficiency in hot
weather, and there are three major requirements for refrigerator
operation.  These are:  ventilation, a good heat source, and leveling.
A few checks of these systems, especially after extended storage periods,
will help the refrigerator when it needs the most owner attention.
