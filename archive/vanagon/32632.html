Subject: re:  secret rituals

&gt;ok. since it's friday, i'll ask:
&gt;why is the gesture of the extended middle digit called &quot;the bird&quot;???
&gt;doesn't LOOK like any bird i ever saw.  you ever see a bird that looked like
&gt;that? not me. anybody ever heard anything about the derivation of that name?
&gt;

Excellent question!  Originally the &quot;bird&quot; flip (originated in Italy in the
late 1500s) consisted of the thumb, pinkee, and index finger, thus
resembling a bird's &quot;foot&quot; and hence the name.  As generations used and
reused this great tradition various derivations arose, leading to much
confusion, especially among fellow bird watchers and early orinthologist
clubs.  In late October, 1788, a select group of European diplomats gathered
in Paris to universalize this profound expression of anger.  After much
bickering between the Italian and German delegates a physical fight ensued
between Alfredo Romeo and Gustov Grundig which resulted in Grundig cutting
off all of Romeo's fingers except the middle.   The gathering was postponed
till later the next year, but events in Paris prohibited a second meeting.
So that's how the modern usage of the middle finger came about.
