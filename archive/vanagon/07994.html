So Joel Walker says:
&gt; 
&gt; well ... depends on the ones you have. i finally got tired of those k-mart
&gt; types, and went down to the 'real' auto store, and bought a pair of 'real'
&gt; jack stands: 2-ton, ratchet-thingie, with a square (four-sided base). they
&gt; cost about $50 (nowadays, i think), but they are long-term, heavy-duty,
&gt; solid-built, hard-to-carry, etc. all-that-good-quality-junk. in other words,
&gt; it's a buy-for-life kinda deal. they can lift the bus up about 18&quot;, but i
&gt; have to do that outside (the quote-garage-unquote isn't tall enough for the
&gt; bus and the jackstands).
&gt; 
&gt; then a few years ago, i decided that i needed to be able to work on all four
&gt; wheels at once, so i bought another set. :)
&gt; 

I was afraid you'd say that.  I guess I can ask for a pair for my birthday
cause I think they're important enough.  I'll have to keep the old cheapies
for the Sentra because of the low clearance lifting.  I wouldn't dream of
trying to lift the van in my garage.  Hmmmm.... I wonder if that would be
a good excuse to get a house with a big barn?....nah, she'd never buy that
one. :(  ;)
