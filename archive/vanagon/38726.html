Subject: Holley (Weber) progressive on T-IV

Volks,

        Having time to ponder (waiting for ##$%_at_$% UPS ground stuff from
Calif. to Texas!) I wondered whether anyone had ever mounted the common
Weber dual downdraft (actually mine is Holley built under license to Weber)
for Type IV backwards.  The way mine is, the choke, idle, idle mixture are
all at the back (unreachable, no space to firewall, etc.) and the only
reason for mounting it the way it is is for the throttle to hook up easily.
It seems as though a fairly simple lever could be employed to actuate the
throttle if it were turned 180 degrees (and, no, not vertically....I have
been following this list long enough to see potential razzing).  This would
make life much easier when it comes to adjusting and fine tuning.  Well, has
anyone done this?

Thanks in advance,

Chris Vaughn
