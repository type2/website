&gt;Hi! I just purchased an 85 Westy and have a couple of little

&gt;replaced. Any thoughts on where to find one and how much they cost? 
&gt;Also, the flip covers on the drivers side that cover the electrical 
&gt;and water hookups need to be replaced. Otherwise I'm really happy 
&gt;with it and to have found this list!

All of these parts are available from the manufacturer, Euro-American RV
Products (formerly Delta-Six Industries). You'll gag at the prices, but they
are much cheaper than VW dealers and the parts are not available anywhere else.

The skylight is $139
Assembly with rollers is $24

They don't sell the flip up covers separately, you must buy the entire
thing. The city water filler costs $29, I imagine the others are similarly
priced.
