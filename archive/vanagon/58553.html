OTOH,
 maybe the VC fluid heats up, locking in the front plates and as there is
nothing (no DS) to prevent the plates from rotating, they quickly spool up to
match the speed of the rear plates, when the fluid starts to cool, unlocking
the plates, letting the front plates slow down, causing a speed differential,
which causes the the VC fluid to heat up......etc.,etc.,ad nauseum ad
infinitum endless do loop as the miles roll away. 
But as there is no load, except inertia and viscous drag, no problem, except
that the silicone fluid gets a low impact workout.

A little knowledge is a very dangerous thing. An engineer operating outside
his discipline is a disaster waiting to happen.
