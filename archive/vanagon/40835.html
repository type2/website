Subject: a/c, cooling question
Date: Mon, 29 Apr 96 20:14:20 EDT

Hey all,
I have a question.  I know that the engine tin on my bus ('78) is
supposed to keep the engine compartment airtight from below.  However,
my bus has dealer-installed a/c and they hacked away that left rear tin
for the compressor, leaving a few gaps in the tin where the road can be
seen through the tin.  I'd like to seal this stuff off, but what should
I use?  Can I use anything?  Obviously I don't want it to interfere with
the compressor's operation.  

Anybody with a/c done anything like this?

Sean
