&gt; How about the cabins in Lakeside village, on Huntingdon lake. I used to know
&gt; the guy  who ran the resort, Steve Sherry, I will call him if Huntingdon Lake
&gt; is OK. This is at 75000 ft above Shaver LAke behind Fresno. There is a ski
&gt; resort next to the Lodge &amp; I think the road is snowploughed in the winter.

Wow!  So is this party &quot;Bring your own U2?&quot;  SR71?

Behind Fresno?  I thought Fresno was behind everything else...
