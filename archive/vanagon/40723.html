Okay._dot_calling all those VW freax this side of the pond..dont forget Stanford
Hall (Leicestershire) Show and Swapmeet next Sunday! And if you like Splits
watch out for the arrival of the SSVC convoy (we are aiming for 100 plus
Splits thus year) at about 10.30!
If you are a Splitty owner we leave Wolvey at about 8.30..go up the M69 then
down the M1 to Lutterworth..where we pause for the mega convoy photoshoot. We
have 5 German vans coming over to join the fun and frolics! Special SSVC
Splitty display/line up in front of the stately home. Miss this and kick
yerself..you wont see anything like this till next year!
For all you who can only read about it and wish...I'll post some details and
review sometime after next Sunday....Stanford Hall is always one of the most
prestigious VW events (in my humble opinion)
But dont forget the International Bus Meet in UK *next* July...&quot;strange
strange gathering of tribes.....&quot;
