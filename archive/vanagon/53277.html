 &gt; Hi
 &gt; 
 &gt; I just bought an 89 Westy.  I've noticed that it has trouble
 &gt; starting when it's very damp out.  I live in Montreal and it's
 &gt; been raining alot lately.  I was told that adding gas-line 
 &gt; anti-freeze will help.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Any comments?

I just Identified faulty wires by lightly spraying wires with water at night.
 I found a spark plug wire had a spark jumping from the wire to the fuel
injector wire, about 3/8 inch distance.  It also shorted to the metal shield
at the spark plug end.  New wires all around yielded a great improvement.
