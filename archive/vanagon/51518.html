Hey Bob - do you have any thoughts ref throttle position while doing
compression checks?  In the old carburetor days I got in the habit of
checking w/ choke lodged open &amp; a brick on the pedal for full throttle.  I
have to admit I've never done it any other way, so I don't know if there's
actually a difference between a wide open intake tract &amp; one choked off by a
closed throttle (and choke).
