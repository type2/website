&gt; Hello, I am a Vanagon fanatic and I belong to number of
&gt; organazations representing these vehicles.  The one complaint we all
&gt; have is the lack of power.  Has anyone ever considered a turbo kit
&gt; for the waterboxer engine?  It seems to me that this would be a
&gt; relatively easy instalation with good sales potential.  Most owners
&gt; would be ecstatic with say a 30% horsepwer improvement and the
&gt; Vanagon cooling system has plenty of reserve capacity.
&gt;  The low gearing of these vehcles would help to keep the turbo
&gt;  spining and
&gt; provididng boost for hill climbing and passing which is this
&gt; vehicles short fall. Please let me know what you think. Thanks,

sorry but we do not have the time or money to develop one. It would 
be a nice addition I agree!!
