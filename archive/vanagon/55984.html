Subject: Thank You: RE: Opinion on 1978 VM CAMPER

My husband and I were very happy to hear from all those who
responded to our questions about purchasing a 1978 VW Camper!  We
were much more prepared when we went to see the Camper.

Everyone agreed that the price was high or it would have had to of been
in tip-top condition.  We also received wonderful tips and facts about that
year of VW and in purchasing a VW in general.  The questionnaire was
great!  We tested out as being possible VW owner :).

We did look at the VW.  It was a sharp one.  The gentleman who has had
it for most of its life (except when a friend - also a photographer - had it,
kept good care of it.  However, it did have some rust in the  various
areas and the canvas pop-top, though not torn, had tiny holes, and their
were other minor problems that I could visually see.  We wanted to offer
him less but he was firm about the price.  I think he is hesitant on selling
it.  He likes it a lot!  I could see that he knew it inside and out. 

We will have to pass on this one, but plan to continue looking.  With a
baby on the way and uncertain cash flows, we will have to stay in a
low price range.

Again, Thanx to everyone who helped us out!
