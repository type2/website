Subject: Fwd: Vanagon Sunroof air deflector bubble wanted

Sorry - the company who made these sunroof air deflector bubbles was named
&quot;Clim Air&quot; , not &quot;Uim Air&quot; as I previously mentioned. The label was hard to
read. They also make the Vanagon front drivers and passender window tinted
plexiglass &quot;vent shades&quot; or whatever they're called that lets you keep the
window open a bit without water coming in.  Does anybody have the &quot;Clim Air&quot;
front window deflectors?  Anybody have an address for Clim Air?  It's a
German company who sold it's accessories thru VW dealers among others.
I just saw an '87 syncro westy at Maple Grove this past weekend with the ones
on the front windows.
Any info would be helpful. 

thanks,
chris
'84 GL sunroof (with the &quot;Clim Air&quot; deflector)
'83.5 GL 9 pass. sunroof (without one)

Hi, all - I am looking for a smoked tinted black lexan (plastic) sunroof air
deflector bubble for the Vanagon sunroof.
These are NLA from VW.
The German company who made them is named  &quot;Uim Air&quot; and they made sunroof
bubbles for all VW's (golf/jetta etc) too, and distributed them thru VW
dealers. 
Anybody know of a sunroof van in a junkyard w/ one of these on it, or know of
one kicking around somewhere in a dealers partsroom or someone's garage?

Anybody have a address for Uim Air??

slim chance at any of the above, but appreciate any leads...

chris
