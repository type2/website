Subject: Re: (lack of) EV vs. Cara?*a*

Yea, I got to make fun of a Car_van a while ago while picking up some 
bookcases at Service Merchandise.  

It was great, they were gonna put their purchase on their luggage rack, 
but it weighed too much.  So they try to put it inside, amazingly, no luck 
there either.  Then the guys kid looked at my EV with the seats down and 
said &quot;why can't we do that (pointing at my van)?&quot;  Then the kid asked why 
they couldn't bring their stuff home and the Dad said &quot;we have to go home 
and take the seats out.&quot;

Have you ever noticed how many of those shi*boxes have luggage 
compartments on top of them while traveling?  Guess it just wouldn't fit 
inside. ;)

&gt; BTW we blew his (our neighbor) mind this weekend...bought a new kitchen
&gt; set (table and 6 chairs) still in their packing boxes...not a problem
&gt; pop down the rear seat...slide in the box with the table (30 x 60 x 8),
&gt; and three boxes containing the chairs (24 x 24 x 36). Still had room
&gt; to seat the (now) 3 year old kid in the remaining jump seat in the back...
