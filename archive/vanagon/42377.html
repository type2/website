&gt;p.s.  somebody finish this one, I'm stuck:
&gt;
&gt;Jack and Jill went up the hill
&gt;to park the Karmann-Ghia,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Try this:

Jack and Jill went up the hill
 in their quick new Karmann-Ghia,
When they got to the top
 they spotted the cop
 and Jack exclaimed &quot;Oh, Momma-mee-a!&quot;


Okay, you try to rhyme something with Carmann-Ghia.

Or how about this?

Jack and Jill went up the hill
  in their quick new Karmann-Ghia,
When they got to the top
  they spotted the cop
  --Opps, too late!
