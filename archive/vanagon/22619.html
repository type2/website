Subject: Yeah, another &quot;should I buy...&quot; question.

Howdy All,
	Finally I found a yard with numerous VWs in my area (Long Island). 
It's called Gerts (he has a shop too) and he's really cool.  He must have about
ten busses/campers scattered around and he let me owe him $2 for a curtain rod
I needed for my '73.
	Anyway, here's my real question.  I've always really wanted a split
window (who doesn't?) and he has a '66 poptop Westfalia in the yard.  The good
stuff is that it's all there.  The interior is complete, the windows are good,
the engine starts (and looks really clean too), it has all the hubcaps/trim
rings, bumpers, wheels, etc.  I'm not sure but it may still be 6v.  The bad
news is that it has a couple of small but bad rust spots.  The main area is
right behind the front bumper at the bottom of the nose.  The rest of the rust
is on both sides of the bus but it's hard to see the extent because the PO
screwed on some stainless strips along the bottom, but the wheelwells are
perfect as is the rest of the bus, never been hit either.
	Okay, he wants about $400.  I think this is pretty cheap, but I have no
clue how much bodywork costs these days, anyone out there have experience with
this type of work.  Could I do it myself (I've learned to do everything else)? 
Of course, I wouldn't decide definitely before I take a good look at the
underbody and behind the stainless steel stuff.
	Would I just be better off waiting for a rustless one to come along
(lots of $$$$?) or should I get this promising (?) project? (that is, of
course, once I finish my '73 in a couple of weeks).
	Thanks for your time,
Erik.
