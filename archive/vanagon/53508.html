WAIT!   ... i'd said:
now the 'fast idle' on a pre-86 engine is totally different. there the
bypass air is regulated with an electromechanical device that has a bimetal
strip that lowers a disk over the bypass orfice. a heater wrapped around
the bimetal controls the 'warm up' time on this and one can see an authentic
fast idle with this system. no ECU input.

before Mr. Skerbitz corrects me, (and he WILL!) i'll correct myself.  the
Digijet system DOES have some form of electronic idle control... the
infamous box on the firewall with 2 plugs in it.  it stabilizes the idle by
advancing or retarding the timing (only at idle) to give a somewhat uniform
idle speed.  same thing should happen as in the Digifant... pretty much even
idle speed regardless of conditions.  in theory :)

there.  i feel better.
