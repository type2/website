Subject: Re: HELP! FI Fuel Supply(?) Problems with 75 Westy in Phoenix


My Oxy-fuel .02:  My '70 Kombi actually gets 2-3mpg. better with the 
oxy-gas than, say, in the summer with plain old petrol.  Natch, it has no 
FI.

&gt;   I'm pretty much stranded in Phoenix due to this little
&gt; problem.  The current situation is that when I cruise down
&gt; the highway all is fine, but when I put a bit of a load on
&gt; the motor it begins to crap out.  I have to ease back on
&gt; the peddle to keep the engine running.  Generally at the
&gt; top of a hill i'm doing between 25-35.  This I can almost
&gt; deal with.  The problem arises when I exit the highway.
&gt; When I get to the stop, the engine dies.  If I wait from
&gt; 10 minutes to 2 hours I can start it again.  This is not
&gt; good.  I can crank all I like but  it doesn't help.
&gt; 
&gt;   The problems started a few weeks ago when I first fueled
&gt; up in Phoenix.  They use that nice oxygenated gas with great
&gt; amounts of either alcohol or ethers in it.  The next day I
&gt; had some serious loss of power sometimes and others it would
&gt; be not soo bad.  I replaced the fuel filter and it acted
&gt; better but within 5 miles the fuel pump seized up.  Fortunately
&gt; I was in the middle of nowhere...  Things seemed ok, but not
&gt; great.  Still the lack of power problem.
&gt; 
&gt;   I drove up north to Flagstaff this weekend (around 7 or 8000
&gt; foot gain in elevation) and the drive up was miserable with the
&gt; car stalled every time I got off the highway, even on the way
&gt; back down.  As long as I kept driving it would keep going.
&gt; Only if I let the engine rev too low would it die.
&gt; 
&gt;   I took the beast to a local shop and they determined it
&gt; was bad points.  It was plausible, so all fixed I headed
&gt; out to continue my journey (hiking in Sedona or ??).  I got
&gt; about 5 or so miles down the highway and the same thing
&gt; happened, loss of power and it stalled when I pulled off 
&gt; the highway.  I'm not scoring any brownie points with other
&gt; drivers trying to get through the intersection at this
&gt; point.  10 minutes later I was able to get it started and
&gt; stuck to the side streets where it runs fine.
&gt; 
&gt;   The shop says it has good pressure and all seems well.
&gt; They don't know what to try next.  Neither do I.  The 
&gt; new fuel pump makes a good bit of whizzing noise but
&gt; so did the old one..
&gt; 
&gt;   Any ideas?  Please respond to me directly; I receive
&gt; the mailing list digested.  I really like Phoenix, but
&gt; I've been here tooo long.
&gt; 
&gt;  thanks,
&gt;
