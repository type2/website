Subject: Vanagon Antenna Mast

 Hi everyone! First of all, to the people that are going to the VW show,
drive carefully and beware of the other people on the road. There are a
bunch of idiots that call themselves drivers. Like always, to the point.

 My antenna mast broke. The base is there and the connection to the radio is
made by two wires and they are soldered. Original Blaupunkt radio (AM/FM
stereo). Do I need to get a new mast and base? Is there a way to put another
mast on the base?

 What are the degrees of the slope on the Vanagon for the antenna base?
There are kits available for different slopes. I have been thinking about
mounting a different radio with a cassette player and needless to say, I
have to get an antenna with the kit. BTW, I have no problems in mounting it,
just don't know what to get that would fit. TIA
