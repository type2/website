Subject: Has anyone done front brakes on Eurovan?

Has anybody out there done the front brakes on their Eurovan?

Mine are almost gone, VW wants $120.00 for the pads alone.  NAPA has them 
for $40.00.

Also the dealer asked me if they were vented, have you seen any Eurovans 
with vented rotors?

Do these prices aound about right?

Does anybody have any pointers on doing it?

Is it any worse than a Vanagon?

I haven't got my Bently yet (two months and counting).


Thanks for any help,
