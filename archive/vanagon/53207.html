Subject: Re: Forget the Drums, How do you get the Lug nuts OFF!

&gt; &gt;       Well I attempted to put to use all the good advice I got on how to
&gt; &gt;     pull (maybe hammer would be a better description) the drums off the
&gt; &gt;     '85 Vanagon.  However, I naively assumed it would be easy to get the
&gt; &gt;     wheels off--I could not remove even one of the lug nuts.   I have
&gt; &gt;     tried penetrating oil soaked over night, heat from a propane torch, &amp;
&gt; &gt;     a six point impact socket and 2 foot breaker bar.  None of these have
&gt; &gt;     even allowed me to get a slight turn out of any of the nuts.
&gt; 
&gt; A 2 footer?  Boy, you haven't even begun to get serious.  Get a 4 foot
&gt; piece of metal pipe to fit over the breaker bar (about a foots worth).  Now
&gt; you've got torque.  Mulitply your wieght by 5 and you know the torque
&gt; potential.  That nut will jump off from fright alone!
&gt; 
&gt; This is what they'll do in the shop anyway.  You won't believe how easy the
&gt; nut will turn with that kind of power applied to it.  It not only will get
NOT always!! When we first got ours, I couldn't get the front's off 
using a breaker bar &amp; 3ft pipe (I weigh 150). I took it in for new 
front tires, and watched the biggest guy there lean on &amp; *break* a 
2ft &quot;cross-type&quot; breaker bar. They then used about 30&quot; snap-on 
breaker, and a 5-6ft pipe, with TWO guys on it, and finally broke 
them free.

Needless to say I was amazed the studs/bolts didn't break!!
