&gt; First. My '81 Vanagon is going to get a new 2L long-block from GEK (sp?) as

&gt; this companies engines? Also, since I am replacing the engine, can anyone
&gt; suggest what else I could/should do as a matter of general principle? This
&gt; volks has 131K miles. As far as I know, everything (except the exhaust and
&gt; brakes) is stock and original. Before dying, this van ran great.

    I have a GEX engine in my Syncro. I would not recommend them as an
    engine rebuilder. I have found the following problems:
     1 - low oil pressure
     2 - several stripped threads.
     3 - noisy lifters
     4 - cheap paint on the block that comes off.

    This engine runs strong. But,If it would dye, by looking at the
    outside of the engine, I would take the engine right to the
    junkyard!
