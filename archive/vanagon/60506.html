&gt;Ron, you sent a message a little while back saying that you did not need

&gt;want to help it continue in the  way that it has to the benefit of

Ralph,

Checks and International money orders in U.S. funds would be very welcome.
I just wanted to avoid dealing with many different foreign currencies, as
I'm sure you can understand.

Send them to:
