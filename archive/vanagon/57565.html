Subject: '84 sliding door adjustments?
Date: Mon, 24 Mar 1997 15:51:00 -0600

Hello everyone.  It's snowing really hard in Mpls right now.  Anyway, I
recently replaced the cable inside the sliding door of my 1984 vanagon.
It opened and closed without incident for about one week.  Since then
the door doesn't open.  It looks like the cable isn't pulling far enough
forward to completely disengage the mechanism on the rear of the door.
I've tightened the threaded screw/nut that the cable passes through.
However this didn't seem to do anything.

Both Bentley and Haynes mention adjustments that can be made to the rear
of the door.  It's a bit cryptic (surprise!), and a quick review didn't
help at all.  Are there adjustments that can be done to the mechanism in
the rear of the sliding door?  Or does all the adjusting happen nearer
the front of the door.  As ususal, I'm asking before I search the
archives.  Please forgive me.  Thanks in advance,

Tim Casey.
