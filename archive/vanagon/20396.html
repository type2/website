Subject: FS: 76 Westy (Ann Arbor, MI)

1976 Westfalia Camper (2.0 L FI)

Bought from a Floridian last summer.  New exhaust, heater boxes, cables.
Garaged from October through March.  Body in very good shape.  Official VW
color is sage green but it looks more like guacamole to me! 

Mechanical:  Rebuilt engine installed last August with approximately 3K to
date. Have receipts.

Camping: Canvas good to fair (screen ripped).  Stove works fine.  No fridge.
Haven't tried water pump.

Must sell - have over 5K in it and no time to camp.  Will consider any offer in
3K range.
