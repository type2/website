&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; What would cause 'low brake pedal'?
&gt; 
&gt; I just got new rear drums &amp; brake shoes.  I've checked the brake fluid
&gt; resevoir &amp; it's at max.  I don't see anything leaking from under.  It
&gt; seems I have to pump the brake pedal to get the 'normal feel' of
&gt; braking.  Any thoughts would be appreciated.

This sounds exactly like what happened to me last weekend.  I got new rear 
shoes and both rear cylinders were leaking, but went unnoticed when 
the shoes were put on.  you have to check them carfully. for my van, 
there was no noticable leak and the resevoir level did not drop.  If this 
is not your problem, then i dont know what is.
