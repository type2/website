Subject: Thanks, Shirts, Paint

	Bob, welcome home! And thanks for the story!

	All, are there going to be more tee shirts???? I know
a couple of deserving people whom I could give them for Christmas...

	Regarding paint...
	My brother and his wife had their 69 Beetle repainted and did
the best job you could do, IMHO, with someone else spraying the paint. They
stripped it themselves, removing the interior, the engine, the windows, rubber
seals, bumpers and exterior trim, door and hatch mechanisms, running
boards and soundproofing. By removing all the rubber and glass, the new paint 
could be sprayed just like at the factory, and new rubber installed 
for that &quot;Brand New&quot; look.

	They wrote up a detailed specification for the work, 
spelling out how the vehicle would be preped by them and what they
wanted done. They talked to several paint shops to find out what
exactly they wanted, and settled on a urathane enamel, rather than a
'Two pack'. They then took the spec around to paint shops and
made a decision based on how they felt about the shop's bid, not
just lowest price. Some shops didn't want to talk from their spec.
That made for easy decisions. 

	The finish they specified included:
	- Sanding/hammering/dollying as required
	- NO FILLER
	- Primer/Sealer (not just primer)
	- Paint it. (Sanding and number of coats up to shop)

	The purpose of a sealer is the put an innert barrier between
previous factory and one re-spray paint and the new paint. They left
details of how to paint up to the shop, wanting the shop's best take
on a durable paint job for a nice old car. I'm sure they noted that this 
was a 'fun' car and no premium was placed on finishing in 2 days or 
whatever. The paint shop was expected to work with dispatch, but not 
knock them selves out.

	Paint shop cost: $1300.00

	Two-pack (epoxy? Polyester?) paint would have started at $2000.00

	This Beetle had been red, and had been repainted once. It was and is
in extraordinarily good condtion. One or both previous coats were
disintegrating in a couple of places, but generally, this was not
a 'bare-metal' repaint, nor did a lot of old finish have to be removed.
Some dents and dings needed pounding out and the paint around them
sanded.

	Under the tar-covered styrofoam boards of the floor insulation
some water had collected and rusted the pan. That rust was given rust-
converter and primer and then glossy black spray paint before the car
went to the paint shop.

	The only things that needed masking were the gas tank, transmission,
the tires and wheels and the head-liner. The headliner is glued in and
was in perfect condition, so they kept the one they had. 

	They inspected it before signing off and paying for the painting.
The shop kept it a couple of days extra to work over a spot they weren't
happy with, but total paint shop time was less than 10 days. 

	Stripping the car took a couple of weekends, with parts to
be re-used going into boxes for cleaning and stuff being replaced
getting tossed as they went.

	On the big day, the Beetle was flat-bedded to the paint
shop, where it stayed for a week. When it came back, it went
back into the garage. It looked NEW.

	They took six weeks or so to re-assemble the car, using parts
from various suppliers, ordered en-masse. Research revealed that the
felt-channel parts of the door windows were something the local
Bugformance guy couldn't do himself, and so they paid $60 a door
to have a glass-shop install all the window bits and pieces.

	Did I say it was beautiful when done? Of course, as
owners and artists, my brother and his wife can see defects and flaws,
but a casual observer such as myself doesn't see them. To me, 
it looks just like the new ones I saw at the dealer in 1969!


	IF you want to paint yourself, using HVLP, I saw a wonderful
example of a home-repaint a guy did with a 914/6. He stripped the body,
natch, and then built a plastic-sheeting cocoon, walls, floor, ceiling,
around it in his garage. A bank of furnace filters, 2' X 6' at least,
allowed clean air into the 'paint booth' and fans exhausted air from
the booth. No dust, no bugs, no overspray all over the world. Its a 
100 point car and the first one this guy ever painted. He practiced
on a Coke machine!

	I'm not clear on whether he just had a mask or used a positive
pressure system. I'd be inclined to wear a mask AND pipe in outside,
filtered, air at pressure to the filters. Can't be too safe.

	Bill
