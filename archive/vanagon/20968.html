the big confusion here is the use of the term &quot;water&quot;. in its liquid form,
Scott is right: you dump globs of water on the surface of the radiator and
the liquid screws it up. but if you put a mist, the droplets of water are so
small that they are almost instantaneously evaporated, removing heat ...
or so it was explained to me. :)

there is a BIG difference between &quot;water&quot; and &quot;water vapor&quot; ...and the big
trick to making something like this work is getting the water into a vaporized
form of mist, rather than a liquid form.
