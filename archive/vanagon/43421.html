Subject: weird disk on '59
Date: Sat, 01 Jun 1996 19:07:37 -0600
From: Dieter Dworkin Muller &lt;dworkin_at_village_dot_org&gt;


On the passenger side of my '59 kombi is a tin-grey disk about four
inches in diameter, held on by a couple of very small (and rusty)
screws.  Specifically, it's about half-way down on the outside of the
wheel well skirt, just in front of the seam.  There's what looks to be
a stylized mountain range in the middle, with a VW logo in the lower
half.  There's lettering around the outside.  On the upper part, it's
..ermetz, and on the lower, ger.....  The letters are mostly effaced,
unfortunately.

What is this disk, what did it used to say, and what is its
significance?

Inquiring minds want to know.
