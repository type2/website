&gt;Certain members of the list believe a hot shower is a necessity of life.  


to All... While Veeduber's shower extravaganza sounds very nice and enticing
in the other three seasons,  i would strongly advise Not to shower while
winter snow camping.  Your skin will not dry completely and you will shiver
the whole night through.  and possibly even risk frostbite and or
hypothermia.  I speak from experience.  If you are staying in a heated
shelter its quite another story,  but if sleeping in a tent or a non-heated
vehicle welll...that's your call.
