	Okay, he wants about $400.  I think this is pretty cheap, but I
	have no clue how much bodywork costs these days, anyone out
	there have experience with this type of work.  Could I do it
	myself (I've learned to do everything else)?

Sounds cheap, depending on the rust (as you say).

I don't do much of my own work, so I can say
that six weeks in the body shop for my seriously
rusted '78 ran $2200.  This was, I should think,
the seriously upper end -- lots of welding and
new metal, complete sanding up to the door handles
or so, repairs to the front axle assembly, new
tail-lights, repair of a right-rear (puncture)
collision with a truck's hydraulic lift gate, good
(not great) paint job over primer, and those
anti-ding mats glued to the lower 6&quot; of the skirt.

Coming on two years later, and the rust is showing
a tad here and there at some joints -- it's a disease
you can't really shake completely, especially
given road salt.

I expect the body prep is all doable by the 
compleat idiot (tm), but I'd guess painting is
a good thing to have done professionally.  This
assumes you can weld sheet metal, of course,
which I gather is a matter of some artistry.
