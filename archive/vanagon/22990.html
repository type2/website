Subject: Smells like Phish...tastes like...

Bill responds to Rusty's slip of the &quot;old fartedness&quot; by saying:

&gt;the band is PHISH...they seem destined to be the 'next' grateful dead...
&gt;Can't you imagine kids following them around in aging Chrysler mini-vans
&gt;over the next 25 years?


Yep...while on Martha's Vinyard it seemed the number of Phish paraPHanalia
being sold in the t-shirt stores out numbered the Grateful Dead stuff
by a wide margin...   &lt;sigh&gt;


Actually given from what I saw on the Vinyard..I don't believe that
these kids will be driving aging Chrysler mini-vans but clapped out
Jeep Cherokees!  ;-)
