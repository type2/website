Subject: Re: Help replacing A/C hoses on '89 Vanagon!

 
&gt; &gt;Hi,
&gt; &gt;My Vanagon has developed a leak in the long A/C hoses that run the length of
&gt; &gt;the car.  Has anyone replaced them before?  How long should it take?  Where
&gt; &gt;should I get new ones?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I had to replace one of mine a while back.  I removed the hose and took it to
&gt; a local A/C wholesaler/shop who re-used the ends and made me a &quot;new&quot; hose.  I
&gt; don't recall the specifics, but I do remember that it saved me a bundle
&gt; compared to the dealer price$.  If you're interested in doing this
&gt; mail-order-style, I could dig out the name/number/address of this Southern
&gt; California shop.

I just ordered the high pressure hose that runs back to front from
Camelback in Phoenix.

Part # 253 260 702 C (4270 mm) $278.20

Don't know what the local dealer price is.
