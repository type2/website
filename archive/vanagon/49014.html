Subject: AC compressor source?

My '86 seems to have burned up its poor A/C pump this weekend in our
nice 110-degree spell.  It has a Standen 510.  It lost all of its freon
(sorry Gaea) so I had no difficulty in removing the compressor.  The
compressor appears quite damaged -- it got hot enough to melt all of the
plastic bits.  Any good source for rebuilts?  The bentley shows replacing
the 510 with a 710 (? I don't have the book nearby).  Anybody have advice
on this?
