Subject: Re: how to look at archives?

Gerald, 

     You didn't finish your message to the guy who had only been on a short
time and wanted to know how to access the archives.  Your message cut off
right at the point where you said you were thinking about dropping people
from the list.  Would you re-transmit?

     I have been all over the archives during the past few weeks but for the
last day or two I haven't been able to get in.  The gateway down and I don't
know what all.  If he's having trouble, he's not alone.
