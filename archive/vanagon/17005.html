Subject: Re: tranny problem

&gt;       so that it does not arc or need to be &quot;pushed&quot; to 
&gt;	the right to start on my 84 Vanagon autotranny, its 
&gt;	apparently developing a &quot;middle age spread&quot; over the years.&quot;
&gt;
Happened to my Rabbit, lifted off the cover plate on the floor, found the 
contacts had worn down, so bent them up gently with a pen knife. Did the 
contacts on the lever and on the switch plate. We had lost the reverse 
lights. Try this, it's cheap. Lube it when you are done, to keep the wear 
down.  tim s.
