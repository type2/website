I know I'm kinda repeating myself but Martha would really
like to know if anyone else is bringing kids down to Pfeiffer?

Her daughter is concerned that it will be all adults and 
doesn't want to go if there are no other children. (Can't
say that I blame her.)

Also, is anyone else bringing any dogs or other pets for
that matter?

Please respond ASAP! 

Thanks,

Steven
