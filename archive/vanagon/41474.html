Subject: RE:68-79 Van/Westy parts for sale

If you get this message, please let me know what I have to do to buy from
you the rear hatch bug screen. Is it in good conditions? How much it costs
including shipping and handling to San Juan, Puerto Rico? Are the curtains
the original ones? If that's so, what price you have for them? Thank you
for your help.
