Subject: New List Site status report

Just to let you know...

I just went to the bank and deposited 142 checks and $114 in currency,
totalling $1,819.00.  I've written a check to Chris in San Diego.  He tells
me that he's expecting the new machine any day now, and that we should be
up and running on the new system by July 1st.

We're still accepting donations (our goal is $2,000), so if you haven't
sent off your check yet, please do so.  Send a check payable to &quot;Ron
Lussier&quot; to:

     Vanagon
     c/o Ron Lussier
     10164 Parkwood Drive #8
     Cupertino, CA  95014-1533

Thanks to all those who've already gave and gave and gave!

Ron
