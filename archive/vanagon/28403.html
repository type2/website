Subject: re: Hearses? fwd from usenet

There is a picture in the NEATO 1996 calender with a converted hearse in it.
 They call it a 62 &quot;Frickinger&quot; Hearse.  It looks like it was made out of a
double cab pick up.  There is one cargo door behind the passenger door (we're
looking from the front to the right), behind it is one long window.  The air
vents are down low like in a double cab.  I think I can see a seam across the
roof where it was extended back.   &quot;Their neighborhood undertaker provided
the suitable oak coffin!&quot;  I wonder what the owners are like....
