&gt;                                         Positive Things
&gt;
&gt;A recent thread asked for positive examples of the benefits of bus ownership.
&gt; That is the sort of question that reveals far more than it asks.  On the
&gt;surface it appears to be a simple request for information, to which I've
&gt;responed in the first part of what follows.  But peering deeper into our
&gt;navels, we're liable to come upon a lint-ball we're unwilling to touch.
&gt;
&gt;Those of you who have seen my 1965 bus know it is not a thing of beauty.  The
&gt;paint scabrous and pie-bald.  One reason for its rough appearance is because
&gt;the bus is in constant use, there is no time for cosmetic things. Tasked with
&gt;a 900 mile trip several times a year plus an occasional longer jaunt, more
&gt;than 1,500 miles to attend the Big Sur outing, or hauling a ton of Portland
&gt;cement to the top of Mt. Palomar, the bus is expected and required to do all.
&gt; And it does.
&gt;
&gt;The simplicity of the engine's design makes it amenable to modification,
&gt;allowing incorporation of modern technological benefits not available when
&gt;the vehicle was manufactured, such as electronic ignition, a full-flow oil
&gt;filtration system, a better cooling system and more reliable electrical
&gt;components; it now uses an alternator rather than a generater and runs better
&gt;for it.
&gt;
&gt;The bus handles better than it did when new, thanks to better tires and a
&gt;stronger suspension system.  Most importantly, the bus gets better gas
&gt;mileage, requires less maintenance and is more reliable.  Because of its age
&gt;the cost of insurance is low, as is the annual license fee and it does not
&gt;require the biannual smog inspection expected of younger vehicles, although
&gt;its emissions are an order of magnitude less than those allowed by law.
&gt;
&gt;My bus has not had an easy life and I am at least its fourth owner.  It has
&gt;suffered from collision and all of its major mechanical components have worn
&gt;out through its years of service.  But as things wore out, they were
&gt;repaired, overhauled or replaced so that today only the front axle assembly
&gt;and chassis are original as-manufactured parts, and the front axle will be
&gt;replaced before I set out to drive to Inuvik, a few oceans away.
&gt;
&gt;All of these things argue for the postive aspects of bus ownership yet to the
&gt;mainstream of American thought, my bus and I are examples of failure.  The
&gt;bus contains not a single molded plastic cup-holder.  It has neither
&gt;carpeting, air-conditioning nor stereo.  Indeed, it has no radio at all and
&gt;incorporates none of the supposedly necessary features, all of which were
&gt;designed for the lazy, thoughtless and immature.  My bus has neither buzzers
&gt;nor chimes nor even a light that springs on when I open the door.  All of
&gt;that falls to me.  If light is needed, I must turn it on.  I am responsible
&gt;for my own safety, and for the safe operation and maintenance of the vehicle.
&gt;In a society were no one is ever at fault, the buck stops here.  
&gt;
&gt;And therein lies the message and the only valid answer.  The reliability --
&gt;the honesty and functionality -- of any vehicle, system, agency or anything
&gt;else, is nothing more than a reflection of the person in charge.  My bus.  My
&gt;responsibility.  If it craps out, it's my fault.  No excuses.  This applies
&gt;equally to every aspect of our lives.  We have the capacity to shape our
&gt;lives and determine our own destiny.  Not some group or governmental agency
&gt;or Book.  You are the person in charge.  You may accept or deny your
&gt;responsibilities.  The evidence indicates most have chosen denial.   
&gt; 
&gt;The purpose of this list is not to preach the obvious but to illuminate the
&gt;obscure.  Unfortunately, in the modern age the obvious is often obscured, and
&gt;not by chance alone.  If the logic of that is unclear it's good evidence your
&gt;life is not your own.  You need to achieve a higher plane to achieve a
&gt;broader view.
