So Ron Lussier says:
&gt; Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; It seems entirely possible that we're having our collective chains yanked.
&gt; Is Leo trolling us?  (If so, he's been pretty successful.)
&gt; 

I considered this too, but whether he is or is not does not bother me in
this case because it still might help some wannabes/lurkers/fence sitters
make a decision.
