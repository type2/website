Subject: FS: '93 Eurovan CL

As the subject says, I found a '93 Eurovan CL.  Its white with gray
interior, 68K miles, 7 seater.  No fold out bed.  A/C and A/T.  Seems
nice.  Not sure of the price its at Flynn VW/Mazda in Pittsfield, MA.
(413) 443-4702.  Just thought I would pass this info along.  I wish it
where a MV with a poptop.  I'd buy it in a minute.  take care.
