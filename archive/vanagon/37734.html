Subject: EV transmission cooler &amp; Tire prices?

Well, I went and got come quotes on tires today, and OUCH they're expensive.

_at_ Goodyear:

   1.  205/70 - 15 Aquatred II's  115.99 each, set of 4 with all the 
                extras $601.04.
   2.  195/70 - 15 OEM's 133.80, or $684.50 for the entire deal.

Isn't that more than most of the people on the list paid for their 
entire busses?  :)

Personally, I think this guy is out of his mind.  Has anybody else priced 
these things?

Also has anybody put 205's on their Eurovan?  Did they fit ok?

Also checked at a local discounter for the Pirelli Aquamile's.

205/70 - 15's $79.95 each, 80,000 mile warranty, 454.11 for the entire 
set including lifetime balance and roadhazard.

If I can't find Goodyears cheaper, I'm gonna try the pirelli's.

I also called Uhaul today to see about getting a hitch, they want $216 
for everything, not bad considering what tires cost, thats for a Class II
3500 lb hitch.  

My question is, this is an automatic, can the EV be easily fitted with a
transmission cooler?  Does anybody have one on their EV? Does the EV
already have one? 

I only need to pull a medium weight 19 ft boat, and doubt tows will go 
over 100 miles.  Maybe a trip to the Keys, max about 400 miles.

What to do guys with hitches think?

Any opnions would be highly appreciated.
