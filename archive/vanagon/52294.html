Subject: Re: Save your ball joints!



hey..i checked up on this self curing rubber tape..i found it at a local 
rubber products supply house..&lt;here in KC..forgot the name..&gt;

Its in rolls, 1 inch widde, by 55 ft long. and costs ~60$'s a role..

now, i'd be willing to split the roll, and price with other KC area list 
members who also need to renew, or rebuild their boots..just let me know..

unless there is a cheaper source?

&gt; Do you have an early 80's Vanagon, or similar vintage VW?  VW uses
&gt; &quot;permanently lubricated&quot; joints in the suspension on the late model
&gt; busses. Grease is kept in and dirt kept out by a flexible rubber
&gt; boot. This works well, saving you (or your mechanic) from having to
&gt; &quot;lube&quot;, but only for a while. After 10 years or so, the rubber usually
&gt; cracks, and the previously sealed joint is now exposed to the
&gt; elements. The Bentley manual says: replace ball joint!
&gt; 
&gt; I noticed this summer that the rubber boots on my ball joints were
&gt; getting brittle and one of them had cracked. However the joints
&gt; themselves were still ok, and the suspension &quot;tight&quot;(*).  Instead of
&gt; replacing the joints per Bentley, I thought about other solutions:
&gt; 
&gt; Replacing the boot: about as difficult as replacing the joint, since
&gt; the joint has to be taken out to slip a new boot over it.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Renew&quot; the boot: Well how can you do that? Self vulcanizing (or self
&gt; curing) rubber tape is a product, which much like a inner tube rubber
&gt; patch chemically bonds to itself and other rubber. The tape however is
&gt; much thinner and elastic than even racing bicycle tube patches.
&gt; 
&gt; To apply the tape on the old boots I first thoroughly cleaned
&gt; everything and let it dry. Then I applied a thin coat of vulcanizing
&gt; solution (as found in tire repair kits) to the old boot. The tape
&gt; cures to itself without any extra solution, but the old boots had a
&gt; dry and cracked surface, which needed to be softened to make the tape
&gt; stick. I waited a minute or two for the solution to work, and then
&gt; applied a thin layer (two overlapping turns) of tape stretched to
&gt; about half its original thickness.
&gt; 
&gt; Before sealing the one cracked boot I also injected a little new
&gt; grease through the crack.
&gt; 
&gt; When I inspected the joints 6 month later (this weekend) I found that
&gt; the repaired boots still look fine, and were as flexible as when I
&gt; first put the tape on.
&gt; 
&gt; (*) I checked the front end for &quot;tightness&quot; by lifting the bus and
&gt; trying to rock the wheel in all directions. Is there a better way to
&gt; do this?
