Subject:       Re: moaning wheel and censorship


&gt; 	Its time to revisit the moaning wheel:
...
&gt;  It will make the noise even if I just put the drum on the spindle
&gt; with my hands, and wiggle it back and forth, without the nuts.

Watch it, Thom.
This is exactly the thing that Senate Bill 314 is to prevent, along 
with flannel prunes. Seriously, folks, we should probably all respond 
to the petition mentioned in Eric Oster's forward this morning. Log 
in to http://www.phantom_dot_com/~slowdog/ if you have a web browser and 
take a look at the bill and the petition. This is just another move 
by the politicians to infringe on our freedoms. At its worst, this 
bill could bring down a lot of the net services because of the 
impossibility of conforming to its regulations. 

&gt; 	Any new gueses?  This is the _only_ mechanical niggly I have right
&gt; now!

Is it a constant mooooaaaaannnn or does it make noise more in line 
with suspension movement? It could be a dry bushing or bearing in the 
front end or a bad shock.
