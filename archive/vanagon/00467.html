OLA
	Beneath seats is a great place to put bass!!!!!
	I have mounted 8&quot; subwoffers inside my driver and passenger seats
	(between the springs and wheel wells of my 78bus). These will give
	you alot of boom, using less power. The important thing is to invert 
	them (piont them down, I fooled with pointing them up and didn't like 
	the results, boomy growly muddy mess). Who knows tho, try something 
	different perhaps it will work. I made a small sealed enclosure for
	each driver (i'm considering porting, perhaps??) and faced it down,
	bouncing it off of a 3/4 inch piece of particle board. Play around
	with the distance between the driver and the particle board difflector
	and you get some really interesting effects. Also try covering the 
	deflector with various things (ie bare, foam, burlap etc.)
	I would'nt go larger than 8&quot; unless you can find something to fit in 
	that space (let me know if you do!) Also remember these babies are 
	right under you (girls seem to enjoy this more?) so you don't
	need 400W per channel, try 50-80W rms.
	
	You will feel the bass, you will taste the bass, you'll smell it too...
	
	These are subwoofers only (ie &lt;200hz) so you will need midbass drivers
	otherwise you will hear only mudd. Don't dream of sending the seat
	woofers more than 800hz or you'll call me a liar about the quality.
	Min of 50W rms per channel too! 
	
	Keep me posted, everybody has brilliant ideas:) and I'm not to
	proud to steal them;)
