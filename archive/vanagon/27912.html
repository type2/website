Subject: 80 Vanagon update

well, the verdict on the motor is that the mixture is simply too rich. I
think this is compounded by the fact that the weather here has been colder
and drier lately. There was a hint of this behaviour (kind of a sputtering)
when I picked it up after all the head work, but it went away quickly and
was not very strong.
it's *real* strong now! Driving it home today while it was still kind of
cold had me doing &quot;the lurch&quot; at one point. Pretty embarrasing!

The question is whether this is a problem caused by a simple mixture
misadjustment or whether the intake air valve (aka air flow meter) got
dirty or something during the engine R&amp;R. (the rest of the FI system tests
out okay.)
But the air valve costs too much new (US$270) to just swap out for a test.
The CO adjustment screw cover is already opened up, so *someone* was
playing with the mixture at some point. Maybe someone adjusted it to
compensate for the leaking heads, and now that they're fixed the thing is
just too rich. I don't know.  In any case, I'm hoping that the adjustment
will be sufficient to lean it out to normal - since it was working fine
before this head work.

btw: looking at that intake air valve, I'd say there is some level of
adjustment in there - a pin is used to add tension to the coil spring, and
there is another screw which allows one to alter the angle of the
potentiometer contact - allowing one to change its output relative to the
valve position. I'm not brave enough to change it though. Not yet at least.
Any Bosch engineers on this list?

P.S.
There's one nice thing about buying a new car and keeping it for years -
you know everything that's been done to it. I've had my 84 Volvo for 12
years now,
and while it's no showstopper I know that no other backyard mechanic has
been screwing around with it.
