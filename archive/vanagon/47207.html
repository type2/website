&gt;My '87 Westy, 2.1 L wasserboxer engine, is getting only 17 mpg
&gt;highway.  That seems low to me.  Is it typical for the rest of you
&gt;guys with vans of similar age and equipment?

I've typically gotten 16 to 20 MPG from my Vanagons.  My 87 is hindered a bit
being a Syncro, and the 88 hindered a bit with an automatic transmission.  I
think that lifetime averages for both of them is in the 18MPG ballpark.
 Neither is a Westy.

&gt;One contributing factor might be that it has the wrong tires --
&gt;205/70R14 car tires, max load 1400 pounds.  It should have light-truck
&gt;tires, like the ones it was shipped with.  And having the wrong tires
&gt;often means lousy gas mileage.

At least they're the right size tire.  Many passenger car tires are made for
good fuel economy.  I doubt that this would have too much effect on gas
mileage, but there's some potential there.  I would guess that 17MPG while
perhaps not great, is within the normal range for an 87 Westy.
