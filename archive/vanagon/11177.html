&gt; I can't get either of the rear brake drums off.  I've ordered the Bentley
&gt; book but haven't received it yet.  Is there some trick?  So far I've:
&gt; pulled the wheel, removed the two 11mm bolts, released the parking brake,
&gt; and yanked, banged.  The drum rotates freely and seems to be frozen on
&gt; rather than simply being held up by the brake shoes.  Is it simply a matter
&gt; of getting violent with it?  There doesn't seem to be a good way of getting
&gt; a good grasp on it to yank.  Thanks for any help.  (

When I worked on the rear brakes on my '87, I couldn't get the drums 
off the hubs either. I had to remove the big axle nut and pull the 
hub and drum together. Only by brutal hammering was I able to 
separate the drum and hub, which seemed to be rusted together.
