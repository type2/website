Subject: Trip Report, Dallas to WV

On business in Dallas last week, bought a gorgeous, '90 GL, A/C, PW,
PDL, alloys, AT (ugh I guess I'll finally find out about them) 81k miles, 
head gaskets at 65k, etc.  Very slight damage to sliding door area, 
will be under $200 to fix.  Price, very good, will not say more in 
case I sell it.

Stats, approximately 1150 miles in 17 hours, average speed 68 mph, 
average mileage 18.5 mpg (a little worse than I hoped, AT I guess)

Real nice van, amazing how they last down there, absolutely no signs 
of seam rust, and hell the door has been unpainted steel for 3 
YEARS!! and still no rust.

Having a hard time deciding whether or not to sell to dad.
