&gt; Anyway, the new company I work for, AllData, sells manuals
&gt; on CDROM that have the TSB, recall, info, wiring diagrams,
&gt; diagnostic and repair procedures, test procedures, maintenance
&gt; schedules, and bunches of other stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; Its $24.95 for a single make/model.  I haven't actually used it
&gt; yet, but I've seen it used a coupla times, and it looked 
&gt; neat.
CD ROM, eh? I guess that's for the new ones, so late models must be on
8-track ROM, and us splits are on Reel-to-Reel ROM! 
:)
Almost Friday...
