Subject: part name/number question

Saturday the clutch linkage ceased to function in the '73 Campmobile.  I had 
just finished helping a friend move and when I left to go home, pushed the 
clutch pedal in to shift to second... and it stayed there.  Got home without 
the clutch, but the problem was caused by the clevis pin freezing up, which 
finally wore out the end on the clutch cable where it attaches at the front.

The question is this - the rotating, kind-of-round, steel part that the 
clutch cable attaches to with the clevis pin - what is Volkswagenspeak for 
this part (and what is the number, if anyone knows).  I've called several 
dealers this morning and based on their responses I'm not sure they know 
what part I'm talking about.  I think I would like to replace this part, 
since the round hole for the clevis pin is now rather oblong and I figure a 
small change here will mean a large change in adjustment at the transmission 
end.  

Would the liquid steel products hold here if I was to fill it in and 
re-drill it?

TIA.
