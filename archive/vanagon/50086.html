Soon after ordering the Dansk system from Parts Place which is a 
terrible fit and finish and astoundingly low quality and overpriced
(I mean like 1/8&quot; misalignment of front and rear header pipes EVEN
AFTER I overdrilled the mounting holes to 3/8&quot; to help it fit) 

I noticed these people

California Import Parts LTD (800)313-3811

whose prices are incredible on the US made (I believe) pipes.
ie                          1.9      2.1 
1&amp;3 (front) header pipe     $84     $140
2&amp;4 (rear)  header pipe     $84     $140
connector pipe              $77     $70
cat                         $130    $130
Muffler                     $100    $100
tail pipe                   $15     $15

That is $250 for all the forward pipes on a 1.9 I paid that
for just 2 of the Dansk pipes thinking I was getting a great
deal compared to VW (which I still was)

The quality must surely be as good or better than Dansk and
the price on the 1.9 stuff is incredible, though I mention
that a lifetime Walker muffler is widely available localy for
the same price, check it out PO had 3 for free on the '85.

I also think Hoy Fox (in the T&amp;A mags) has cats for like $100.

FWIW these people have full systems for ALL buses even all the
warped late 70's pieces EGR filters etc.

I know nothing of their quality, nice ads though.
