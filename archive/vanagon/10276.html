&gt; vanagons (water cooled) ie: 1984 and on..  I was wondering if I could by the
&gt; staps used in earlier vanagons and adapt them for my 1987.  Does anyone have any
&gt; suggestions or part number for the earlier straps?  If that doesn't work, i may
&gt; find a way to shorten the ones i have.

The original strap rusted out on our 85 several years ago.  We fixed it using
a steel strap used for packaging cargo.  It has held up for several years
now and it holds an Ansa replacement muffler which was replaced last summer.
It's a bit rusty (the strap) but it still works.
