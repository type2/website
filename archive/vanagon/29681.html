Subject: Bleeding hydraulic lifters??
Date: Mon, 27 Nov 95 23:12:14 +0000 (GMT)

Hi all.
After replacing the head-gasket, I have reached the point that I need to
replace the push rods and rockers.  This I did but was unable to set one of
the valves.  So I assumed that the hydraulic lifter needed bleeding as you
can push in the lifter with thumb pressure - so bought a new lifter [the old
one was chipped].  Anyway - could someone advise me on the correct way to
bleed this lifter?  The manual does not explain the procedure very well.
Also, any advice on setting the valves? 
Thanks in advance for any help,
Cheers      MIKE
