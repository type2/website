Subject: Re: Awnings

Is this the price of just the awning? or does it include the mounting brackets
as well? My Carefree of Colorado Freedom Awning was about $250 and the 
VW mounting brackets run about $50 as set. So if this is the price for both,
then they are equal in cost.

Will post full details on mine later, as requested by several listmembers.

&gt; Called Camping World.
&gt; The model is a Catalina 2500.
&gt; There is no such animal as a 2000.
&gt; 
&gt; Requires measurements:
&gt; Sizes available are: 8'2&quot; _at_ $299
&gt; and 9'10&quot; _at_ $339.
&gt; 
&gt; Mounts directly to rain gutter.

&gt; &gt;My awning is the Dometic Catalina 2500.  It is a gutter mount that goes
&gt; &gt;from the back of the van to the front of the sliding door.   Extends
&gt; &gt;about 8 feet and has small plastic pole holders mounted on the side of
&gt; &gt;the van.  So when it is set up it is completely free standing. I can
&gt; &gt;move the van for optimum shade without taking the awning down.  I
&gt; &gt;wouldn't live without it!  Not sure what the 2000 model mentioned in
&gt; &gt;this thread is like but I sure like mine.  Set up and take down is a
&gt; &gt;breeze once you learn the tricks.
