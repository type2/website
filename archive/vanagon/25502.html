Hey guys,

It's that time of year again and I have to put my Bus up for the winter.  
Up here in Duluth, Mn. Snow flies at the end of Sept.- to mid Oct. until 
around May 1st. 

With my previous buses I didn't do anything to them before I put them 
away, just took the tires off and propped it up.  

This new 73 with a 77' motor and drive train might need something else.

What do you do when you store a Bus for the winter?

any info will be appreciated.
