Subject: Breaker bar trick

Hey now,
        Came up with a great idea for a breaker bar. Been thinkin' for
about a month that I'd need to run to home depot or some such for a length
of pipe, and while jacking up the bus, it came to me. Use the jack handle.
Works like a charm, comes apart into 2 small pieces for easy storage, and
best of all I already carry it with me. The handle has a rubber piece on
the end for gripping it, I used my utility knife to cut an &quot;X&quot; in it, and
it holds my socket wrench great, no fumble fingers. Hope this helps out
somebody when stranded on the road...

Peace,
