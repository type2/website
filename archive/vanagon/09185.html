Subject: west coast trip - hikes, dogs, music


Here are the listed hikes for the area:

Pfeiffer Falls Trail, Valley View Trail, Oak Grove Trail, Gorge Trail,
Nature Trail, Buzzards Roost Trail, Pfeiffer Beach

Since they are not very long I will probably go on all of them that I
can, including going out at night and very early morning. No over-
nighters tho. There is also a day use area a little south of where we
are that has a lookout for whale watching - the gray whales are on
migration right now and travel pretty close to the surf.

How many people are bringing dogs? I am deciding to not bring my
Golden Retreiver since most areas are verboten for dogs. But dogs are
handy for prewashing my dishes if I can find a dog to volunteer for
that :)

I will be bringing maybe my dumbek and/or bongos along, but the only
skill I have is to keep a 4/4 beat, so if anyone else wants to solo,
grab the drum and go at it.
