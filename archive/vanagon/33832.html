Subject: RE: Interstate battery charging question.


&gt;1- a 'conventional' battery?
&gt;2- a 'low maintenance' battery?
&gt;3- a 'maintenance free' battery?

Careful. In my experience, &quot;maintenance free&quot; doesn't mean the battery
doesn't need maintenance. It just means you can't give it any. So, they
don't last as long as batteries you can pour water into as needed.

BTW, Some &quot;maintenance free&quot; batteries actually do have little caps,
hidden under the big label on top. Tear off the label, and you might
be pleasantly surprised. Especially after leaving the headlights on all
night, which sometimes depletes the water in the electrolyte and makes
you wish you COULD put some distilled in there...
