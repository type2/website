Subject: RE: Appropriate VW musicians....


&gt;Drugs:  Who cares.  It's a personal decision and a victimless crime; one
&gt;willing seller and one willing buyer.

You don't actually believe that, do you?


&gt;I don't see why the government
&gt;should be in the business of protecting people from themselves,

Neither do I. World's never been a safe place, and government can't
change that. Individuals can, if they try. But govt ain't the way.


&gt;and if
&gt;you are against drug use, then don't use drugs.

And shun those who do. Before you find them in your tool shed.
