Subject: FS: 1981 VW Camper Bus

The body is a bit rusty on the drivers side but the motor is rebuilt
and the interior is redone. About 100,000 miles on vehicle. Sleeps 4
with the pop up top. Has a sink and water tank with ice box fridge. It
does NOT have the gas option for cooking. New tires and front end
suspension pieces. Very nice summer fun car. It is located 25 miles
west of Boston. I am asking $3000. Please email directly - Brett
