Subject: Bus Door Handle

OOPS! Just broke the finger pull lever on the outside handle driver's door (&quot;72
Westy). Anybody got a handle? Condition of the chrome is unimportant; All I need
is the pull lever. 
Alternately, anyone have experience with aftermarket items such as this? I would
consider a new one if I thought the quality would be at least as good as what I
have. 

Thanks!
