Subject: Filling an auto-stop propane tank.

This has been posted before but there's alot of new people so it's 
time to go over it again.

1.  Turn off appliances.

2.  Shut main valve.

3.  Thread propane hose onto filler.  Push the attendant out of the 
way and do this yourself.  They whang it around too much.  It is a 
little tricky to get threaded on just right but with your practice it 
becomes easy and then YOU get good at it.  I've found they are 
usually relieved when they see you know what you are doing and just 
stand back.  They know how to operate the propane pump-- you know how 
the van takes it.

4.  Tell them to get their valves ready to start 
pushing propane in but don't start yet.

5.  Open the bleeder ALL THE WAY.  If there is propane left in the 
tank it will hiss out.  This is normal.  Don't smoke.

6.  Have them start filling.  Takes 3 gallons max.

7.  When liquid propane gushes out the bleeder, have them shut down 
the filling.  While they are doing that, YOU close the the bleeder.  
Wear the rubber insulated gloves they have to do this as it is 
extremely cold.

8.  There is a bleeder on their filler hose, you or they can open 
that to bleed pressure off. then disconnect the filler from the van.

It is not normal for propane to squirt back out of the filler for 
more than a brief second or two after disconnect.  If it continues, 
you need to clean the auto-stop valve and install the repair kit.

That bleeder valve is open to the propane tank.  If it is left 
cracked open you will lose all your propane.  Any time you open the 
bleeder with propane in the tank, propane will come out.  It serves 
as an indicator that the tank has reached its 80% capacity.  The auto-
stop will also monitor the level and shut off at 80% but the propane 
liquid comes out the bleeder a little before the auto-stop shuts off.

If you have problems getting the propane to flow into the tank, make 
sure the bleeder is ALL THE WAY OPEN.  Yes, it is a little scary to 
have propane hissing out.  Additionally, if propane still doesn;t 
flow, push in on the red button on the left side of the fill valve.  
THis pushes the auto-stop plunger over manually and allows 
propane to flow.

Lastly, read the directions for filling that came with the specific 
tank/valve combo.  This post concerns only the set-up on my '87 
Westy.  I did not have the instructions before me as i was entering 
this so if i've missed something, you may die.
