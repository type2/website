Subject: Re: speedo resto..

I'm curious about this too, and am assuming you're talking about the 3 colored 
indicators on the bottom of splitty speedos. I have replaced these a couple of 
times with colored acetate (?) from craft stores, but it seems to fade quickly, 
and isn't the right opacity (opaque-ness?).

&gt; Rich sez he replaced the indicator color (windows) in his speedometer.
&gt; Rich, are these homemade or actual acquirable parts...?
