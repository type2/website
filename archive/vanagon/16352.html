John ...

I hope I am the one direct mail response you got since I did send one but something 
happened yesterday. I got no mail from the listserv until this morning ...
 and then THE FLOOD!!

In case yo did not get the message, I mentioned that I have tried several offers to get 
the DC folks together ... no result.  If you can make it happen, I'll support it!

Similar to what you mentioned, I'll make myself avaliable for a short-distance, 
short-notice event.

With a week (or more) advanced notice, I'd seriously consider a drive of up to five or 
six hours.

I still like impromptu jaunts to the Blue Ridge area, West Virginia or Pennsylvania.

It's getting to be the kind of weather that makes me want to get out and the van needs 
to be exercised!
