&gt;After spending each weekday with control freaks, the last thing I need is
&gt;a group that involks the same unwarranted behaviour
&gt;
&gt;maybe someday Hutton will tell you all who I am, and in the meantime
&gt;
&gt;I'm outa here!
&gt;
&gt;See ya!

Huh?  
And how is this good-natured troupe in any manner control freakish?
