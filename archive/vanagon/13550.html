&gt;...                           After replacing all four tires, the original
&gt;owner had four different ones on, the problem with the cv joints has not
&gt;occured in the past 15,000 miles.  Could having different tires in the front
&gt;and rear affect the read of the viscous coupling???

hmmm. i know it's not a good idea to have different treads on the rear axle,
supposedly because of the possible different friction/grip putting stress
on the differntial. and since syncros have a front differential, that would
seem to also apply to their front axle(s).

so i guess it's possible that the difference in the front axle(s) tires
could be different enough (from the rear axles tires) to confuse the
viscous coupling into thinking that some wheel was slipping ... and it would
keep trying to lock itself ... which would probably be the cause of that
knocking noise. ???

i do know that the porsche mechanic in birmingham (where my brother used to
work) will not even put his spare tire on his 930 ... he just calls a
wrecker and waits, for just a flat tire. he claims that the narrow spare
tire on one side, and the wide &quot;normal&quot; tire on the other side will tear
up the differential (if it doesn't snap an axle).

i wonder if any other 4WD vehicles have this problem ... like Subaru. don't
they also have viscous coupling linkage? i know the mechanical linkage 4WD
folks (explorer, 4runner, pathfinder, etc.) don't care or don't know about
this ... at least the bubbas down here ride around with GKW tires (God Knows
What). :)  ... but then, maybe their rides don't last. ;)
