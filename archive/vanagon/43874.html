Subject: GA Vintage VW Show June 15
Date: Fri, 7 Jun 1996 13:37:58 -0400 (EDT)

Peach State Transpoters will be sponsoring their 4th Annual 
Vintage Volkswagen Show on Saturday June 15.  It will be held 
at Lake Acworth Beach in Acworth, Ga.  Note this is a new 
location from the past 3 years.  I put a flyer up on the web 
with directions for anyone interested.  The URL is

Could someone please forward this info to rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled 
and the aircldvw, vintagvw lists?  My mailer has been down for 
over a week now and I'm having to use this damn Elm on UNIX.

Thanks,

Dave Easterwood
