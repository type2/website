Mine does this as well....and the symptom goes away when the driveshaft 
between the front and rear is removed.  When the wheels are at the lock, 
each and every tire is tracing a different path, turning at different 
speeds.....just as if you were driving on a slippery road.  The synchro unit 
thinks things are slippery (from the different turn rates) and works to 
transfer power.  Voila, &quot;bindage&quot;.  I think.


My friend has a 89 syncro, just purchased.  When turning tight.  The wheels
bind and have a lurching sensation.  The characteristics seem like the rear
diff is locked.  VW machanic say the CV's are fine.  He said it is a normal
function of a Syncro.  We don't think that is the case.  I Don't have a
Syncro so I can't compare.  Does this happen to other Sycro owners?
