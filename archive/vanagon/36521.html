     I agree with removing the plate before drilling.  A german mechanic 
     suggested that the nut that's used to hold the sensor on should also 
     be welded onto the plate to prevent any possibility of leaks.  Seemed 
     reasonable and only cost me ten dollars or so.

I would definately remove the sump plate first.  It's hard enough to drill 
the hole in the right place without having to do it with the plate in
the engine.  I have heard the opposite about oil temp, i.e. you get an 
artificially low reading in the sump, but it's still a good relative 
indicator.  I used such a setup for 4 years before I finally found a 
Porsche sump plate with the sender boss mounted in it.  They came on 
914 engines.
