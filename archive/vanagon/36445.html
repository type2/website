Subject: more EV manual info


Well, I talked to VW Customer Service today, and they were actually very
helpful. It seems that they have handed off the manual/bulletin
distribution to some 3rd-party company named Dyment (or sounds similar).
They also gave me another number as a possible source of service
bulletings, and gave me the Winnebago service adviser number.

I called Dyment and they have a quarterly index of service bulletins which
you can order from and they ARE CURRENTLY SHIPPING the EV Factory Repair
Manual(s). Only $149.95. But hey, that's what Bentley was going to charge
too. They sell both Owner's and Repair manuals.
The phone number for this place: 1-800-544-8021.

The other place selling service bulletins that I didn't reach because
they're hours were 8-5 EST is at the number: 1-800-423-4595

The Winnebago Service Advisor number is 1-800-537-1885. Hopefully they'll
send me a copy of that manual as well (part number 701674/18/000). Maybe
they can help the cold EV in Toronto too.

Oh, and in case you didn't have it already: VW Customer Assistance:
1-800-822-8987.

(We're going to have to call this the EV list soon, eh?)

95 EV Camper
80 Vanagon Camper  (for sale - see my Web page)

75 GMC 1500 - for those occasional loads, complete with exploding gas tank
and lest I forget -
