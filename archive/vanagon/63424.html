Subject:      Seam rust

Hi Gang, I've noticed several requests for info on how to handle rust,
more specifically, seam rust.
I've got  significant seam rust on my 85 Westy and will probably start to
tackle the chore over the next two weeks.
Does anyone on the list have a method that provides long term results?
As of now I was going to sand down to metal, apply POR-15, sand down,
add glazing putty, primer and paint.
Unfortunately I won't know for some time how this will work.
Any comments?

Thanks.....Harry (85 WEsty)
