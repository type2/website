Subject: Non-VW, but car related, question... (fwd)


I know someone here will bitch at me for forwarding this,
but my brother forwarded this to me and I thought someone here might 
be able to help (I don't know much about the seep except that it existed).

I apologise to those who get fed up easily and don't want to see the
Schwimmwagen's competitor mentioned here.



Cheers
