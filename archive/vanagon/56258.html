Subject: CCC's reconaissance trip 3/25


A few of us in the bay area want to take a reconaissance trip 
to check out Mt. Hamilton for it's appropriateness to astronomy-
watching camping trip on March 21-24.  Although it would be easier
to check campsite during daytime hours, we're going to go instead
in the evening (my damned work schedule, and because it's easier
to check the viewability of astrospace at that time).

Anyone want to join us?  We'll be leaving the east bay around
dinneri time, and it's about 45 minutes from the Hayward area.

Lemme know...
