&gt;  month because of water leaks. The new head work was under warrenty, but 
&gt;  now I'm hearing a ticking noise at idle. It's loudest when first 
&gt;  starting up, after sitting a little while. The dealership looked at it 
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; Are you sure the ticking noise is not an exhaust leak?  Check all connections
&gt; carefully.

Naw!  It's just those new 'Kaczynski' heads manufactured in Montana...  ;)
