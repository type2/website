Subject:      back in Fredericksburg

Hey all,
Well, I made it back to school OK.  The '81, fully loaded with all my
stuff, made the 400-mile drive flawlessly, never missed a beat.  My
speed even approached *gasp!* 70 mph sometimes!  :-)

Anyway, I got my e-mail working here at school today, so it's good to be
back on the lists.

I'm looking forward to the Manassas Bug-Out this weekend, and I hope to
see a lot of you there.

Sean
