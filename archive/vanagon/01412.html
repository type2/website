Subject:      reasonable mpg?

will self said:
&gt;...I drove about 65 mph and got 22 mpg.  Coming back, I drove between 65
&gt;and 80, mostly 80, and got 21 mpg.
&gt;Are these numbers reasonable--what I can expect? ...

well, you guys are really getting me worried!  i have 73,000 miles on my
88 vanagon, and have averaged 19.4 mpg over the six years. now, the BEST
i ever got was 23 mpg. i can get 22-23 mpg if i hold it down to 55-60 mph,
and don't have too many hills. but that's as good as i can get. the sticker
said 17 city, 19 highway. &lt;city for me is about 17.5 summer, 15-16 winter&gt;.

i did a bunch of 'testing' after i put my driving computer in the bus, and
when i get up about 4000 rpm (67 mph), i'm only gonna get 18-19 mpg. and it
drops rather steeply after that.

i really really don't think those tools and spare parts and emergency
equipment weight THAT much. my bus weighed in (at the local truck stop) at
3640 lbs, with full fuel tank and no people. what do the rest of you carry
around?
