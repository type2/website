Folks


  I have the pleasure of having a wife who fell in love with 
a 1982 Diesel Vanagon (blue), which means I am going to pick
it up (300 miles away) this or next week.  Since I live in 
Central NY, I wanted to wait until April when it was a little
warmer to get it..

 Anyway I know of two problems with it (and one comment) 

1) The first &quot;injector&quot; is leaking diesel from the threads (YECH!).
Couldn't get a wrench on it. Looks like a &quot;Special Service Tool&quot;.

2) I was told the valves should be adjusted, and this would improve
performance. Is this true? Is this normal periodic Maintenance?

3) The heat isn't. Reminds me of out 65 (blue and white) when I was a 
young'un.  

 
So, does adjusting the valves help?
