&gt;Hi Larry, I live in London, OH which is 30 miles west of Columbus just off
I-70.
&gt;I have a '78 green Westy and I try to wave at every T2 I see also!  But for
the VW show,  it is at Watkins Memorial High School near Pataskala.
According to this flyer I have, you take I-70 to exit 118, go north on
rt.310 then turn right onto rt.40.  When you come up to Watkins Rd., turn
left and according to the map the school should be on the left.
&gt;
&gt;  For more info call Mark Garrett at 614-262-2881 or Ted Chaney at 614-882-5878

&gt;&gt;Hello all, I would like to welcome myself back.  I graduated from college
&gt;&gt;in May and have been without a net for a few months....
&gt;&gt;I am Larry Stivers now living in Columbus Ohio, I like to wave at all the
&gt;&gt;Type 2 people here but none wave back (except that couple in the Eurovan
&gt;&gt;Westy)  Me- I am on the net for group therapy due to the fact that i own a
&gt;&gt;85 Westy(tan)- and I am headed towards clutch of the month club, too.  
&gt;&gt;Q:  Ya'll have frequent trouble with &quot;throttle switches&quot;?  Trusty local
&gt;&gt;repair shop said I need them, I switched to higher octane.
&gt;&gt;Q2: My steering has developed the shakes at highway speed, what is that?
&gt;&gt;(I had an alignment 6+ months ago-do I need another or is it worse?)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Jim Kirk, of Indy, Had did the trip through this way and further back east
&gt;&gt;work out?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;There is a VW show in Metro Columbus on the 12 of August, but I don't know
&gt;&gt;where, someone please advise.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;peace
&gt;&gt;Larry &quot;Wha 'cha mean I need another______?&quot; Stivers
