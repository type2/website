Subject: Bently Manuals

Hi, all:
&lt;G&gt; I finally get to contribute something useful. 

JC Wimpy's sells the Bently manuals for most VW's. Their price for the 68-79
Transporter (JCW part #BZ6225R) is $29.99 plus shipping. Get the catalog
first... they frequently have coupons in them saving you even more. Their phone
# is 312-431-6102. 

The usual disclaimers... I'm not a member of the mob, and none of my relatives
work there, etc.

-Andy

the VW after the war.
