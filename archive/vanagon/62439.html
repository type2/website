&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a '95 eurovan camper for sale in Portland, Maine. It's in great
&gt; condition, fully loaded, 31k miles, white w/ gray/blue interior, comes
with
&gt; hood bra, awning &amp; tent off back. I hate to sell but I have to. Any ideas
of
&gt; good places to advertise or would you be interested?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Julie B.
