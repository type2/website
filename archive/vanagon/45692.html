Subject: Late Aircooled Engine Recommendations (part 2)

Oh, I do have (and have read) Tom Wilson's &quot;Rebuild Your
Air-Cooled VW Engine.&quot;  It was under $20 including shipping from
http://Amazon_dot_com, and it arrived about 4 days after I placed my
on-line order (they upgraded from basic shipping to Priority
Mail for free).

I'd have to second David Schwarze's recommendation for the book,
and make my own recommendation for Amazon_dot_com as a quick,
convenient source for otherwise hard-to-find books.

(In fact, I was just about to ask where to get a Bentley manual
for the '80 westy; instead I ordered one from Amazon.)

Dennis
