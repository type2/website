Subject: Advice;Trip out West,and Northwest coast-Sept./Oct.

Hello Vagonlist, I have been preparing for a trip from B'ham Alabama to my
brothers, 50 mile west of Reno. I will be using my 1985 Westy to pull a
trailer hauling my 700lb-1985 BMW Motorcycle. (Hope the bus can do it!) I
will be camping along the way and maybe do a few days bike touring in the
Mts. and along the Grand Canyon. After reaching my brothers house in CA, I
intend to leave the vanagon and motorcycle trailer and ride into San Fran
on the K-bike. While in San Fran I plan on doing some job searching within
several Biotechs firms.
Afterwards a couple of days there, I am planning on head up 101 up the west
coast to Seattle to do more job searching and to visit with friends. I plan
on doing motorcycle/tent camping along the way. But I have a few questions
;
1).  Places to see on the way out? Suggestions on routes to take? Places to
camp?
2.) Weather, what can I expect on the trip out through the Rockies? ( Late
Sept.- early Oct.)
3.) Weather along the Hwy 101 late Sept. early Oct.?  Fires? Places to see
along 101 up to Seattle?  (Will be motorcycle/touring/camping.)
4.) Suggested return routes to avoid bad weather? (Nov.)
5.) Cheap places to stay close to San Fran? (Maybe I am dreaming!)
Charles
