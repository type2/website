Hi All,

There are two great deals on reliable bubble windows here in Kansas 
City.  They are owned by fellow list member and Hoover archivist Richard 
Kurtz who has moved from the Kansas City area to Florida.  If he does not 
sell these, he'll have to spend quite a bit to have them hauled to 
Florida on Friday.  He'd much rather sell them, or at one of them, here 
in KC rather than have them shipped.  They are good deals on solid bubble 
windows and both are road ready:

1970 Passenger Bus.  Red and white from TX.  Runs great, very reliable.  
Around 100,000 miles.  Very, very little rocker rust.

1971 Westphalia Pop-Top.  93,000 miles, all camper stuff there.  White 
and stock.  Minor rust below sliding door.  Runs good

They are $1000 each.  email me for more info.
