Subject: Vanagon/San Diego FS


For Sale:

1982 Vanagon GL, 2.0L, FI, air-cooled, 80,287 miles (approx 21K on rebuilt
engine), two-tone blue, tinted windows, 7-pass, rebuilt exhaust 
system, USA/Federal version, currently smogged, registered, and titled in
California. Vehicle currently used as a commuting vehicle in San Diego,
california.

The Vanagon was originally purchased while living in Lincoln, NE, as a 
*long-term* driving/camping vehicle for the family. I'm also the original
owner of a '73 Squareback ... to give you an ida of what I mean by
long-term. With &quot;log-term&quot; in mind, I did a complete engine rebuild (new
oil pump, camshaft, pistons, cylinders, main bearings,lifters, push rods,
tubes,tube seals, main seals, throw-out bearings, flywheel, clutch
plate, AFS, etc., etc.). After the rebuild, it was used daily for short
in-town trips (5-10 miles), and occasionally for longer trips (camping,
200-400 miles RT). The Vanagon was driven to san Diego, in May 1996. Since
September, it has been used alomost daily for a 36 mile RT commute. It has
been averaging abround 17 mpg for the commute. To pass California smog
testing the entire exhaust system was rebuilt (reconditioned USA/Fed
Cross-over pipe, new muffler, new cat aconverter, new EGR filter, etc.).

Ideally, I would like to keep this &quot;workhorse&quot; Vanagon. I have invested a
lot of time, effort, and funds in this vehicle with the intention of
keeping it long-term. But the recent inheritance of an 86' Westfalia,
functionally makes the Vangon obsolete. In addition, my spouse would like
to purcahse a smaller car for commuting. I can't justify the EXHORBITANT
California insurance costs on four vehicles, but more inportantly, I would
like to conserve funds for a complete restoration of my Squareback
(planned for next Summer). 

Botton line: I need to find a new home for this Vanagon. Hopefully, a home
that will use, but not abuse this &quot;workhorse&quot; vehicle.
