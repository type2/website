Subject: Eberspacher Gas Heater parts source &amp; manuals

Hi folks,

Well, last week I got a great lead on a parts source for Eberspacher
heaters.  When I first installed my BN4 my local dealer gave me some old
sales literature from a company called Espar products--the company that
originally imported these heaters and supplied parts to the dealer.  The
Canadian address on the literature was a dead end so I figured they were out
of business.  Last week I heard that Espar is still alive and kicking and
supplying new parts for our trusty companions.

Their # is 1-800-387-4800.  When I called to inquire about a local retailer,
they gave me a few local suppliers in my area:

Vermont:     PPD            802-644-6554
New York:    Cook Brothers  607-723-7481
New Jersey:  Edison         908-985-0331

They also asked me if I wanted a free manual for my heater!  So I had them
send one.  When it arrives I'll compare it to the photocopied manual I've
been using and report to the list about any points of interest.

A great day for gas heater do it yourselfers!
