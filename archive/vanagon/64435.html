Tom,

I have experienced the same results when adjusting the timing on my '86.  I have
been told by a VW mechanic that it is not possible to accurately adjust the
timing without the required diagnostic equipment.  I guess it is not as straight
forward a process as one would expect -idle at 2000RPMs, acessories off, several
engine sensors unplugged-. I ended up adjusting it by ear to where it performed
best without knock. In fact, I believe that I have adjusted mine with
considerable ?? advance but it runs !extremely strong! without any knocking.  I
do now run premium (93) fuel in it now just to insure against knock.

Mine GL is a completely stock auto trans set up- but with it tuned like this I
have noticed a perpensity to turn the tires on damp/wet/sandy pavement. Actually
brought the rear around once leaving a parking lot.  This is with good Michlin
XGTV 215/65VR15 tires.

Could anybody out there advise me (us) what dangers might result from my state
of tune? Obviously I like the power but I dont want to hurt anything (long term)
either.
