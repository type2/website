&gt; Excuse me Mrs. I gotta have a shower/power for my stereo/and my Flo-Bee
&gt; (which who knows what the Hell you need that at a camp ground for!!!/
&gt; gotta have my shower within 12 hours or I'll turn to stone.... 
&gt; 
&gt;    kids, kids, kids... don't squabble... has anyone looked into toting
&gt;    a portable generator around with them? do the benefits of remote
&gt;    power outweigh (literally!) dragging the generator around???

Kids?  KIDS????!!!!!  Hah!  ;p  ;) ;p::::::::::::: 

What's the generator for?  To dry your nails?!?  ;) :O  ;)
