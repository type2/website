&lt;&lt;Happens to me too ('88 Westy w/ key locked filler cap).

Every time I filler-up there's gas on the ground and sometimes when I park
there's a gas odor. However I've checked the tank neck and can't see or
smell any cracks or leaks.

&gt;&gt; Being a new owner of 85 Westy, I'm surprised that every time
&gt;&gt; I fill it with fuel it overflows out the filler tube onto the ground.

&gt;I get this as well. I also would like to know if it is normal, or whether
I
&gt;have a leak in the filler neck or something.

Also happens to me in my 84 Westy and I just had the whole tank-filler
assembly replaced...so I'm thinking it's normal...I hope.
&gt;&gt;

I have an 81 westy and this happens to me also.  Mine however is leaking from
the expansion tanks.  The gas seeps through the cloth covered fuel line(which
sits just above the filler tube) and drips down onto the filler pipe, it then
runs down this pipe and cleans off my undercoating.  I don't know if this
helps, but, let me know if it does.
