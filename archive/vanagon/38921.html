Subject: Re: question re: oil discussion '68 1600

	I pull the air cleaner and pour out the old oil and re-fill it.
5 pints of oil into the motor, one more pint (new) into the air cleaner,
more or less.

The copper birdsnest (copper wool) CAN be cleaned by soaking in
paint thinner or some other solvent, but then what do you do with 
the solvent?? I don't know- I never did clean it in my 914 and will
have to come up with something for my bus one of these days.

	My beloved brother beat this system neatly on his beetle-
he installed a later-model paper-element air-cleaner. Takes the big
square paper filters like Rabbits and Golfs use.
