Subject: Re: Austin Vee Dub bad motor

&gt; Any comments on Austin Vee Dub from listmembers in Texas?

Sorry to hear about your friend's experience with them.  I lived in
Austin from 89-93 and went to VeeDub frequently, always for parts and
never for service.  They seemed to have the attitude that the customer
can wait on them and on several occasions while hanging around the
repair bays I heard their mechanics tell customers the most
unadulterated crap...  Maybe others' experience will vary.

Great place for parts though.
