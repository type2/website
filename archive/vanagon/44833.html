&gt;Now, as I said before, I will be installing the gauge in the dummy plate
&gt;next to
&gt;the speedometer in my '78 bus.  Someone said that I could get a hole drill bit
&gt;to drill the hole for the gauge.  I've never heard of this, but I'm new to
&gt;drilling :) , so would sears have this?  Any tricks I need to know?

Make sure to get the hole saw that is made for cutting metal.  The ones for
wood look tough but aren't (Ask me how I know).  The metal-cutting one will
set you back about $10.  If you don't want to spend that much, you can do
it like I did.  Mark the circle in the plate, and drill many, many small
holes just *inside* the line.  Drill the holes as close together as you can
without touching.  Then break out the inside piece, and use a curved metal
file to smooth the rough edge.  The lip of the gauge will cover the edge of
the cut, so it doesn't have to be exactly perfect.  Good luck...
