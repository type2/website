&gt;Thanks for all the thoughts about what we should do with our new to us '65.
&gt;Maybe someone could tell us what would have been the hot thing to do in
&gt;1965? Maybe a 009 distrib and better exhaust? Anyone out there able to
&gt;remember back to those days? Still would like to perk things up alittle. 

Well, I hate to admit remembering, but....

Now, remember that in '65 you wouldn't be driving a '65, but want to 
boost up your 36 or 40 horse to &quot;modern&quot; performance. Best way to do
it, and also very expensive, was to go to the VW dealer and have
one of those factory new 1500 engines installed!  The first bus I drove
was a 
'61 Kombi with a fresh 1500, and it flew. So, for what was happening 
in 1965, you already have the hot setup. I'll second Clara and suggest
you stick with it.

For the history books, the simpler add ons, in 1965 the things I
remember were the plastic vent scoops, ala Hoover, which were a sign to
the initiates that you had something powerful in that engine
compartment, that needed the extra cooling. You know, hidding something
like a 356 engine. The other item would be an EMPI extractor exhaust,
not a sweet stock sound, but that is what people were doing....

Anyway, with that 1500 you are already perked up. Enjoy it :-).
