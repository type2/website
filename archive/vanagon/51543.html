Another question - I'm on the steep up hill cycle of a learning curve, OK.

My 86 Syncro needs new tires.  After checking out several options I found 
what appeared to be a deal:

Sears (is anyone cringing) offered tires (195 SR 70 14) manufactured by 
Michelin, wearing their name &quot;Guardsman Plus&quot; for $44 a piece.  They are 
double ply tires with a polyester cord, a wet traction rating of &quot;A&quot;, a Temp 
rating of &quot;B&quot;, tread wear of 320 (50,000 miles according to the associate). 
 They fit the specs for Vanagon Syncros in the tire book Sears uses.

The associate offered the tires on sale for $41 a piece and if the payment 
was on credit, an additional 10% off.  Total price - $161.00 including 
mounting, balancing is $8.99 each tire.

I bought them with the knowledge that they can be returned if I'm not happy

Any input?????
