&gt; 
&gt; I recently bought an '87 Vanagon Syncro, and the front tires are
&gt; worn on the outside edge.  Is this because of too much toe, or do
&gt; the tires tend to wear that way?  The tires have about 10K on them,
&gt; and had a front-end alignment done when the tires were put on.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas?
&gt; 

Mine wore this way too and I ended up having to replace them.  It's
definitely alignment related.
