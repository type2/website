Subject: Oil Filter Wrench, Stickers

	Sean, 
	For my 914 I found an oil filter wrench/special tool
that did the job. Maybe this is what your Toyota has? Steel band 
with a fitting which takes a 3/8&quot; socket extension. The band is
in a circle and slides up around the filter, then you snap the
extension into the the fitting at one side, where the band's ends
meet. Turning the handle attached to the extension counter clockwise
tightens the band  around the filter AND applies torque to loosen the filter.

    3/8&quot; extension snaps in here

	Anyway, go to a FLAPS which sells tools and filters and
ask them for help. I think I paid less then $8, tax included. 
An excellent investment.

	My brother has an even more splendid tool, a flat, spiral,
spring wound counter clockwse with a 3/8&quot; drive in the base the spring
attaches to. As you turn to loosen, the spring wraps tighter around
the oil filter.

	A quality, or 'special' tool, makes all the difference in solving
this potentially ugly problem.


	I got my stickers, and they're pretty cool! I'm sticking
mine toward the lower-left of the rear-window of my single-cab, and one
somewhere on the front.


	Been raining recently, snowing at higher elevations. last night.
Mt Hamilton and surrounding hills all blanketed with white stuff.

	Cheers!
	Bill
