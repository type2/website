Subject: FS:84 westfalia

For sale 1984 Westfalia.  Bought the bus a little over three years ago with
84,000 miles - it currently has 113,000 on the odometer.  Replaced the
canvas top and rubber seal for the pop-up 1 year ago.  The head gasket was
replaced (and heads milled) shortly after I purchased the veh. My garage
mechanic says that the water pump  must have been replaced a short time
before I purchased the veh., but I purchased a new one to carry with me as
a spare.  This would go with the sale.  The master cylinder was replaced at
approx. 90,0000 miles.  The vehicle has good rubber all around (Bridgestone
8 ply radials). The body is in very good condition with regards to rust
with two or three minor ding marks. The interior is in good condition.  My
location is in south central Penna. approx. 20 miles from Harrisburg.
Asking price is $4,400.00.  For more information please E-mail or call
717-964-2278 after 6:00 PM.  I'm not usually home Wednesday or Thursday
evenings.
