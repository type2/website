hmmm.....a '97 beetle conv???   I dunno about that...
As far as i know the only mexican made bugs were hardtops, and the last bug
conv. was made by Karmann in Germany in early '80....

maybe someone made the bug into a conv. with a top frame off a junked '70's
bug conv??
highly  possible..with a welder, you can do anything...  :&lt;)
