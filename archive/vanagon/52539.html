&lt;&lt; Help!
 My odometor stop working, so I followed the advice given by list member for
 removal.  The gears were not broken, but just out of place.  I pushed the
 assembly to the right and gears were engaging just fine.  Put everything
 back together and it worked great for about two days, but now we are back to
 the same old thing.  What more do I need to do? &gt;&gt;


You need to crazy glue the driven gears at both ends to the shaft.  The
plastic gear is stretched form the high temps the van is exposed when parked
with the windows closed.  Be careful no to get the glue on the number rolls
or the housing so that everthing needs to turn free can.
