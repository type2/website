So Joel &quot;Needs-the-Force&quot; Possum-Walker says:
&gt; 
&gt; ooooooooh, but yooooooooo don't have the old style sealed beam headlights
&gt; of the older bus what was being discussed, oh turgid one! and, as everyone
&gt; who is anyone already knows, older buses need headlights as bright as they
&gt; can get.
Are these sealed beams halogen?

&gt; trees and bushes overhead. (See also Section 7.89.Z.01 (a), Recognizing and
&gt; Avoiding Falling Possums; see also Section 7.89.Z.02 (a), Recognizing and
&gt; Avoiding Suicidal Armadillos).

&gt; the bus. all them yuppies in them little cars is wearing sunglasses anyway.

Yeah, pretty soon we'll need to reach out the window with those canes the
blind used to feel they're way, so we can drive our vans.  ;)
