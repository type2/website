Subject: re: tires for 83 Westy

    I would like to hear some alternatives to the elusive &quot;xzx&quot;
    treads which no shop seems to carry.  Must I buy a reinforced
    sidewall? Please let me know, money is burning a hole in my
    pocket.  

    What I would really like is a good strong tire with raised white
    letters... am I dreaming?

Jim,

I recently got 2 Yokohama Y370 tires for the front of my '88 Westy 
size LT195/75r14. They were recommended by Harry Yates, and I'm very 
happy with them. They replaced 2 new non-reinforced tires, and made a 
big difference in stability and cornering. They're rated for around 
1800 lbs, load range D. About $105 CDN, or $65 US I think. Only minor 
quibble is slightly noisier at 90km (55mph) or so, but barely 
noticeable.
