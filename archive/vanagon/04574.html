&gt;Here's a quick question. Why does my fuel guage look funny. It doesn't go
&gt;to scale. Or does it?
&gt;
&gt;                |   |            |                              |
&gt;                R               1/2                            1/1
&gt;
&gt;It would seem to me that half way doesn't look half way.

Thats because fuel consumption is inversely proportional to the amount of
fuel remaining in the tank.  The fuel usage goes upward exponentially
with the inverse of the amount of gas you got left.  This is then
multiplied by the distance you are from a gas station, raised to the power
of how deep you'll be in it if you're late.   Add to this the square of
the crappiness value (p 496 - Gas Guage Calculation Table, rev 6.66)
of the neighborhood your'e in.  Multiply that by the the number of miles
you are from home.
