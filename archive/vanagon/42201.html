&gt;Hey all,
&gt;I just have a few quick questions.

I may have a few quick answers'
&gt;
&gt;1) Is it possible to replace the valve cover gaskets on a '78 2.0L with the
&gt;engine in the bus?

Yes.
 
&gt;2) Is it possible to replace the pushrod tube seals with the engine in.

Yes.

&gt;If it's possible is it easy or is it a huge pain in the ass that's really
not worth
&gt;it?

Not too big of one.

&gt;I would imagine the heads would have to be pulled out slightly from the
&gt;cylinders to let the tubes drop out and then re-install.

They can slide through the head.

&gt;3) I imagine it's completely out of the question to replace the oil cooler
&gt;gaskets with the engine in, at least not without a LOT  of disassembly.
&gt;True?

Mostly cooling tin.

&gt;4) brakes. 

I'll leave this one for someone else.

&gt;5) brake-related:  does the rear hub nut (that god-awful big one) have to be
&gt;removed to remove the rear drums?  There are two bolts threaded into the
&gt;drums in between lug nuts, are these for removal, i.e., turn bolts in and
drum pops
&gt;off?

The drum does not have to come off.  Two bolts with 11mm heads hold them on
hoever sometimes rust holds them on even better!  If yours don't come off
look for rust or tight brake shoes.

&gt;Thanks for all help, I appreciate it already.

You're welcome.
