&gt;Hi Ivan,
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Without much luck, I've been looking for a supplier for two vanagon books
&gt;&gt; that I've heard about.  They are:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &quot;The Pocket Mechanic, Volkswagen Transporter 1.9 and 2.1 Liter Water
&gt;&gt; Cooled From 1985&quot; by Peter Russek Publications, Ltd out of England
&gt;
&gt;This is available from Brookland. I have a fax from them listing the book
&gt;but never got around to ordering it. I'll see if I can find it and fwd it
&gt;to you.

I spoke with Brookland about a year ago, and was told they don't carry this
book.  Let me know if you find out otherwise.

Ron
