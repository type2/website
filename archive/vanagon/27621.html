Subject: Grendel's Computer



                   Mosquito Power


The kerosene lantern throws a pale yellow light over the keyboard,
too dim to read the F-key's black-on-dark-gray.  I carry a penlight
if I become lost in Qwertyland.  I'm out in the boondocks, the
nearest electrical power humming through the high-line down by the
road.  But I've got all the power I need.  I'm running on
mosquito-power.  Behind me Grendel makes a mosquito-like sound as
the solid-state inverter hidden in her belly converts twelve-volt
battery juice into 110vac current.  If the mosquito gets out of the
tiny box the computer will carry on for an hour or two on its
internal battery then it too will die, but not before giving me
several warnings.  

Night has fallen, pulling the sickle-thin New Moon out of the sky. 
The horizon is jagged, perfectly clear, the wind calm.  The
twilight graduated from apricot to lime to blue velvet and faded to
black, leaving the full disk of the new moon illuminated by tawny
Earthlight before it too was gone, quickly followed by Venus,
herself a tiny crescent to the eagle-eyed.  I am four thousand feet
above the sea.  The air is lip-cracking dry.  The mountains of
Mexico loom dark on the southern horizon little more than a stroll
away.  I am home, in the high desert hills, camping alone near a
windmill accompanied by a 1967 Volkswagen bus with a past as
checkered as her patch-work nose, now partially restored to
normalcy.

Grendel's computer comes with a printer, a small Canon that fires
ink at the paper like a boy blowing spit-wads, except the Canon's
spit-wads are infintesimally small, their aim more sure than a
Patriot after a SCUD.  The printer too is welcome at the mosquito-
powered powerplant.  

The Toshiba lap-top weighs about six pounds, the printer about two. 
They travel together in a day pack along with an assortment of
cables and paper and spare disks and pencils and pens and the
things normally found near computers and people who use them to
write.  

I can't post to the net.  I have no telephone.  There is a cell
phone that will work with the computer, allowing me to send
messages while galloping off in all diretions.  But it is a
hellishly expensive telephone, made -- I think -- by Motorola.  So
I'll have to wait until I go by the store tomorrow.  They will let
me plug a wire into the telephone under the counter for a dollar. 
Then all of you will know why I haven't been there for the last few
days.

In fact, posting a message from the high desert is a snap compared
to posting one from Shelton, Washington.  Or from the Canadian
arctic, which is what I'm going to try and do next summer, although
I haven't quite figured out how.  I'll have to jury-rig something. 
That will be after I rebuild Grendel's tranny and give her some
decent brake drums and install a more powerful engine and maybe a
skid-plate or two.  There's not a lot of paved roads in the Arctic;
almost as bad as Baja although I hear the weather is cooler.

I'm up here working on a roof, getting ready for the winter rains. 
I'm less than a hundred miles from home but Grendel doesn't like
the grades and takes close to two hours each way.  My 'quick' six-
week trip to Washington has put me behind the 8-ball when it comes
to doing my chores and earning a living.  Sleeping over will gain
me about six hours, what with not having to pack and unpack my
tools.  And I get to watch the moon go down behind Vulcan Mountain. 
Seems like a good deal to me.
