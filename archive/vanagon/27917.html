&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; His name was Bob, he became known for his word, gifted to teach,
&gt; rebuild,
&gt; and lead others to the true reward of their efforts. On the night of
&gt; the
&gt; evil spirits, when owners hide their 4 wheeled box to avoid the
&gt; inherited
&gt; scorn of children who egg, mark or paper them (sometimes mistaking
&gt; them by
&gt; color for the Great Pumpkin), Bob ventured forth to the FLAP to
&gt; complete
&gt; his late night project. Passing by way of the corner 7/11 at the
&gt; stroke of
&gt; midnight, he sensed a thick veil of vapor oozing through the dark,
&gt; enveloping his porous bus, thus masking the world from view.
&gt; 
&gt; Easing to the entrance for refuge, Bob wheeled Grendel by heart into
&gt; the
&gt; familiar lot. He stepped from the van to the pavement, only to find
&gt; that a
&gt; carpet of greens thrived where concrete once had lain. From there rose
&gt; a
&gt; path of steps and stones marking the entrance to a massive gate. He
&gt; gingerly approached the barrier, wondering how he would enter, barely
&gt; able
&gt; to see the outline of an edifice beyond it. The fog was like cotton
&gt; batting now; only the gate latch could be seen, then touched, then
&gt; effortlessly the gate swung open. As it unlatched the fog seemed to
&gt; lift,
&gt; and here standing before him was a kind looking old gent with long
&gt; robe,
&gt; and white beard flowing seemingly as one with his raiment.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Welcome&quot; said the personage. &quot;what the --, where am I&quot; said Bob. &quot;You
&gt; have reached Nirvana&quot; said the old man. &quot;But, I was just goin' out for
&gt; parts. See my Grendel, that's my vehicle, needed a new rotor, and I
&gt; was
&gt; just headed for the FLAP, uh, that's the parts store, when this fog
&gt; fell
&gt; over me - holy _, I mean oh my _, I mean, Jees, I, I.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Quiet, my caterpillar, your venturing is of no surprise. We have
&gt; observed
&gt; your care of the old spirits of wheeled antiquity, and the devotion
&gt; you
&gt; have shown to spare them in their time of need. We have all seen the
&gt; example set by you and your disciples for the masses of unbelievers.
&gt; Now,
&gt; my patient one, is a time of your choosing. You have been elected to
&gt; dwell
&gt; here in Nirvana, if you so choose. You may spend eternity here in
&gt; bliss.
&gt; Let me show you. Come this way.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; The old gentleman turned with the silent rustle of his robe, and swung
&gt; open
&gt; the paired entrance to the edifice. Inside, row upon row, were wheeled
&gt; vehicles from the beginning of time to the present. There were stone
&gt; wheels, wood wheeled chariots, locomotives, river-boats, and every
&gt; wheeled
&gt; vehicle known to man. There was a Ford Vicky, VW Beetle, Mercedes
&gt; gull-wing, DeLorean, Corvette, 240Z, Porsche 911S and thousands more
&gt; in
&gt; neat rows extending seemingly into eternity.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Come, caterpillar&quot; he said, as he entered a central room, appearing
&gt; before
&gt; their eyes. Inside this large circular chamber were tiers of
&gt; barn-doors,
&gt; splitties, breadloafs, Westies, vanagons, spotless and shining, as if
&gt; resurrected with new body and soul.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Where are the Eurovans?&quot;, asked Bob. &quot;Some have not yet served to age
&gt; of
&gt; accountability. See, there is a place reserved for them when their
&gt; time
&gt; has come. If you choose to remain, you will see them arrive as your
&gt; own
&gt; children.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Uh, how about the other mini-vans, you know the Cara_ (choke)
&gt; Caravans and...&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Oh, there is another place reserved for them&quot; And the old man turned
&gt; and
&gt; said no more, closing the inner sanctum. &quot;Now, my patient one, you
&gt; must
&gt; choose&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Bob looked back over his shoulder, then thought about his love for the
&gt; split and bay window beauties. This would truly be heaven. They
&gt; probably
&gt; have a full set of tools, and spare parts for everything. &quot;Hell__ I
&gt; mean
&gt; heck, I could probably assemble one from spares, from the ground up.
&gt; I've
&gt; never done that before. Close, but not completely.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Then he thought of his wife and kids, of the fun he had building
&gt; together
&gt; with their encouragement, and driving the nearly created busses with
&gt; them.
&gt; He thought of the list and all of the problems yet to be answered
&gt; on-line.
&gt; He would miss the challenge of finding and bringing back to life the
&gt; dead
&gt; hulks of long neglected VW architecture.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;I gotta go back&quot; he explained. &quot;They need me there. Maybe some day,
&gt; but
&gt; not now.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;You have made a wise decision my patient one, and you shall have your
&gt; reward in the timelessness of eternity. But, go now--now that you have
&gt; understood that which you have in life; go and serve those that you
&gt; love.
&gt; 
&gt; he could hear voices, seemingly a chorus. There was John Lennon, 
&gt; Jim Croche, Janice Joplin, James Brown, Elvis, Ricky Nelson 
&gt; and Jackie Wilson.
&gt;
Uh, I hate to be a nitpick, but please, James Brown's not dead yet! (I'm
not sure about Ricky Nelson...)
