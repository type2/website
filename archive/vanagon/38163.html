The following is forwarded from Jim Brill;  Jim, if you read this,
can you send along some more info on the kit you got from Harbor
Freight ? (yikes! sounds like a trucking company!!  ;-)  )

******************************************************************

On the subject of fixing the smaller chips, quarter size.  I bought 
one of the do it yourself type kits from Harbor Freight.  I am sure 
the same thing can be had at most FLAPS.  It was $6 and did a very 
nice job on the one I had.  Like Norman said, I can still the out line
of the chip, this one was quite bad, but it does appear to be all 
sealed up.  My time involved was about half an hour and then four 
waiting for it set.  You can't drive the vehicle during this time.
