From: jbrill_at_unlinfo.unl_dot_edu (James Brill)
Subject: Preliminary Tools List
Date: Fri, 10 Feb 1995 10:19:00 -0600 (CST)

This is a test run of the tools list.  I took the 15 or so 
responses I received and ran them together along with what little 
knowledge I have on the subject.  There are some holes in here.  It 
would be great if people could respond to me or the list and answer 
the question marks that are below.  I have not checked this against 
Muir's list.  There are few or no parts listed here.  It makes sense 
that if you are doing a bearing job you should have some grease, etc. 
Also, I typed it up as a Unix file so if you all could spell check it 
that would be great.  I will finalize in a week or less and post the 
results.  It is in American-eze, with emphasis on Sears, etc.  If 
there is some size wrench or socket or anything missing please let me 
know.  I like to minimize my 10 mile trips to Sears.  It is said in 
here somewhere but I will say it again here.  This is a pretty 
expensive list of tools.  You can start out with much less.  I, 
however, want the whole banana now.  So, this is it, or will be soon.




This would be a list of tools that you should have to work on your VW.
It is a compilation of suggestions I received from people.  There are 
things on the list you might never need but others have found useful. 
There are questions to be answered concerning some of the items.  
Please read this over and answer them if you can and I will make the 
corrections and repost.  It should be noted that I don't want to start
big debates about what kind of torque wrench is best.  If the one 
listed is adequate for most and cheaper and more easily available then
we should leave it at that.  Same goes for the rest.

First off, get some eye protection.  After you are in the emergency 
room is the wrong time to be wishing you had been wearing some.

Secondly, buy a fire extinguisher.  Put is under or behind your front 
seat.  Make sure your frequent passengers and mechanical assistants 
know where it is and how to work it.  These are $10-$15 at K-Mart in 
the U.S.  Four things will kill your love - wrecks, neglect, rust and 
fire.

GENERAL COMMENTS

When buying tools from Sears be sure to get the Craftsman brand and 
not the Sears brand.  The former is superior in quality and caries the
infamous lifetime gaurantee.

Snap On and Mac tools, available in the U.S., will have a nicer finish
and might be more heavy duty but will probably not be worth the price 
difference from the Craftsman for just about anything short of a 
professional.  Also, when you break a tool at three o'clock Sunday 
afternoon you know where the Sears will be parked.  As far as I know 
those other brands are only available from the person driving a truck 
around selling to shops.

Check the sales at Sears around Father's Day and other holidays aimed 
at buying things for your average manly man.  Also, go there and get 
their Hand and Power tools catalog (you know when Joel bothers to put 
it in caps it must be important).  I suppose they might have some 
thing in there some stores might not stock but could be ordered.

You should be looking for one of the prepackaged semi-huge all metric 
sets of sockets, etc.  They would have all threee sizes of ratchets 
and sockets, deep and shallow drive.  There will also be various 
length extensions and adapters.  If you catch them or wait for the 
right sale you might even get 10% off or a free toolbox or set of 
pliers.

Some of the suggestions here are obviously overdone.  I am striving to
get a complete set of tools listed.  Most people could to a tuneup and
many other repairs with about 10% of this list.  The suggestions made 
are usually done in the name of having the right tool for the job 
(which also has a safety factor to it) and long term cost savings.

RATCHETS

     1/2&quot;  3/8&quot;  1/4&quot;  drives

     Torque wrench -- 1/2&quot; drive, ratcheting type seems preferable to 
the dial type.  A 1/2&quot; to 3/8&quot; adaptor bit is nice, too.  Craftsman 
1/2&quot; bi-directional goes 20-150 pounds, part # (9)44543, and comes 
recommended.

     Breaker bars in 1/2&quot; and 3/8&quot;

SOCKETS

     1/2&quot; -- 10,12,13,14,15,17,19,21,23,30,36mm  full hexagon if you 
can get 'em.  i.e. six point as oppossed to twelve.

     3/8&quot; -- 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19mm
          -- 10,11,12,13,14,15,17,19mm  deep drive

     1/4&quot; -- 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19mm
          -- 7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14mm  deep drive

     hex-head -- sizes?

     torx-head -- sizes?

     extensions 1/2&quot; -- 3&quot;,6&quot;,9&quot;,12&quot;

     		3/8&quot; -- sizes?
     
     1/2&quot; t-bar

     universal joint adaptor 1/4&quot;, 3/8&quot;, 1/2&quot;

SCREWDRIVERS

     Rechargeable electric w/interchangeable bits for tight spots and 
general ease on the wrist.

     Ridiculously large flat blade screwdriver with a lifetime 
guarantee. (TM)

     At least one with interchangeable bits that has allen heads, too.
The rechargeable one might have these.

     Stubby type sizes and everything up the large one above.

WRENCHES

     Open-end/Box-end  6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,15,17,19,21

PLIERS

     Needle nose, circlip, wire crimping, channel lock, regular, side 
cutters, sheet metal sheers.

VISE GRIPS

     Needle nose, small, large.  Good advice here it to get the Vise 
Grip brand.  Made in De Witt, Nebraska.

PULLERS/CLAMPS

     Wheel bearing seal puller, &quot;G&quot; type clamps (I assume this is a 
lot like a &quot;C&quot; clamp), two armed gear puller, harmonic balancer 
puller.  Somebody please give this portion some help.

ALLEN/HEX HEAD WRENCHES

     2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,17mm  Ball type drive ones are nice, 
too, if you can find them.  The big mutha is for the transaxle fluid.

CRESENT WRENCHES
     
     6,12,18&quot;

CHISELS/PUNCHES

     Center punch, flat-end punch, small chisel, large chisel.

HAMMERS

     Both small and large in hard and rubber, ball peen, too.

DRILL

     Variable speed, what size?
     Metal cutting bits.

MISC

     Little mechanics mirror on extendable handle for looking into 
places smaller than your head.

     Flourescent trouble light, no burns, more shockproof.

     One magnetic-type and one claw-type grabber for picking up things
through holes smaller than your hand.

     Reamer, for making small holes larger.

     Timing light

     Tach-dwell-volt meter

     Grease gun with flexible hose.

     Compression guage, get the type with the screw-in head and 
pressure release button, so you can do it yourself.  [Can we assume 
that Sears has decent prices on this and electrical type equipment?]

     5' fence post makes a nice cheater bar

     You can never have too many 10 or 13mm wrenches or sockets

     Feeler guage, consensus has it that you should spend a little 
extra on the nice one.  Think about what a 0.001&quot; distance is and how 
much you like you valves.

     Broom handle, maybe two is you are working on the front end like 
Muir.

     Pocket knife, razor blade type cutter.

     Hacksaw

     WD-40

     Hand cleaner, gloves, ear plugs

     Propane torch

     Liquid wrench

     Oxyacetylen torch, for when the above doesn't work

     Clutch alignment tool, aka wooden dowel

     Ring compressor

     Plastiguage

     Steel ruler

     Micrometer

     Battery charger

     Old tooth brushes

     Wire brush

     3-ton floor jack

     6-ton jack stands

     Electrical tape

     Test light

SPARE PARTS

	I will not go into this.  My own philosophy on this one has been to buy two if I can afford it, so I have one for the next time.  At a minimum I should guess a spare clutch cable, throttle cable and some fuel hose.
