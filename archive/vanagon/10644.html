&gt; &gt;	There was some speaking of an inspection plate with an

&gt; &gt;Where would I find one of these things?
&gt; 
&gt; the last time i looked, VDO still made that (or had them in stock). it's
&gt; for a 914 engine, but will fit any Type 4 engine from 1972 to 1983 air-
&gt; cooled buses. be SURE to get a new big pink o-ring for it ... or it's likely
&gt; to leak. :) you'll need to get the oil temp sender at the same time (or you'll
&gt; have this big hole to plug up). most any supplier of VDO stuff should be able
&gt; to get it.

My local parts place (Vee parts in San Diego) said they could not get this
from VDO any more.  They said there may have been a problem because the
VDO part was identical to the one VW used in the 914, and VW didn't like
to compete with VDO when selling parts (this was the theory of the guy
behind the counter).  Anyway, Dave Carment and I both want one, and we
have concluded that the only obvious way to get one is now by finding
a 914 in a junkyard.  Sooo... one more thing I am keeping my eyes open
for on those bi-monthly trips to the junkyard.
