Subject: Waterboxer exhaust systems

Hello VW friends,

I'm looking for an aftermarket exhaust system for my '84 Westfalia 
(Waterboxer) as a less costly alternative to VW's factory system. Does 
such a system exist?  I've seen a few systems for air-cooled buses but 
nothing for the water-cooled versions.  Any advice?
