Subject: Matchbox (Lesney) Cars

Some of you people a while back were talking about VW toys and such so I
decided to peruse my childhood Matchbox collection while visiting my mother (a
fatefull trip for my bus, though).  In my younger years I was quite a collector
and managed to acquire massive amounts of the little diecast buggers.  I did
manage to find a couple of VWs but I couldn't find my old catalogs with the
years of all the different series.

First of all I found the &quot;Pizza Van&quot; that someone mentioned.  It is indeed a
bay-window bus (&quot;Dormobile&quot; it says underneath) with &quot;Pizza Van, We Deliver Day
and Night&quot; silk-screened in red and green on the sides.  The van is white and
from 1976 (Wow, I can't believe that this thing is 19 years old!).  Oh yeah, it
has green tinted windows (no interior) and the sliding door on the _left_ hand
side.

The other one is called &quot;Volkswagen Camper&quot;.  It's No. 34 in a series from 1965
I seem to recall so it's a split window (cool).  The color is silver with
yellow tinted windows (including the sunroof in a slightly raised roof area). 
The interior is orange and has facing seats in the rear with a table between. 
Once again this van is right-hand drive with the side door in the left side
(these open!).

Uh, I also found my die-cast Millenium Falcon but you guys probably wouldn't
care about that.

Anyway, hope this helps someone.

-Erik
