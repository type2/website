Subject: RE: uninsured cars

I think there is a law in California saying a car ought to be insured to be
driven. I have no problem with that for 2 cars (1 vanagon and 1 volvo). But
I also have another volvo and a westy and a clunky BMW-2002. I just can't
afford to buy insurance for all of them at the same time. I am not able
to drive them except occassionally I did drive them around the block or to get
gas. The fact that I can not drive them stops me from getting a bug or another
bus (aircooled). So how do you guys out there cope with this problem?
Especially if you have collected a bunch of clunks that are in fact so
enjoyable to drive? I don't think my insurance co. will allow me to switch
cars from time to time back and forth.
