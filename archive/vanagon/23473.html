I totally, completely disagree with WHellmer who says the electrical load 
on an alternator does not significantly affect the effort required to 
turn the alternator. If this were true, the alternator would either be 
very inefficient and difficult to turn at low loads, or, at high load we 
would be getting something for nothing. Sorry, no free lunch. Just where 
do you think this electrical energy comes from? From the torque turning 
the shaft. (And in our VWs from the engine, and, thus from the gasoline.)

In fact, the turning effort is directly proportional to load. (In an old
carburated engine, the idle speed will drop down when you turn on the
lights or other big draw). In all portable and RV generator sets (which
are now all alternators) look at the specs for fuel consumption; they're
directly proportional to electrical load. When large loads are instantly
applied, the engines bog down for a second or two until their automatic
throttle can pour on more fuel. In fact, they warn you not to run the gen 
sets with no loads or light loads for a long time. Why, because the 
engines won't warm up properly and they'll carbon up. Without a load on 
the alternator, the engine has almost no work to do. With a load, it has 
lots of work to do. (If this weren't the case, why not just use a little 
tiny 2hp lawnmower engine on a 10KW generator?). Look in any catalog, the 
higher the rated output, the larger the engine.

If you still don't believe me, find an old bicycle headlight generator. 
Short the outputs. It will be almost impossible to spin with your hand or 
bike. Unshort it with no load. You can spin it with your finger tips.
