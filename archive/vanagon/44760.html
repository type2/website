&gt; 
&gt; Takers?
&gt; 
&gt; Location?
&gt; 
&gt; I think after this last trip, we'd all be mighty pleased to go somewhere
&gt; not hot, and without bugs.  :)  All suggestions welcome.

how about moving the trip to the weekend of the 19-21 and come to ithaca 
new york for the grassroots festival...from what i hear it's just 
starting to be spring up north there...hehehehe :-)
