Subject: westy tipping?


&gt;
&gt;   Has anyone else out there heard that westy's in the US are prone
&gt;   to tipping to the left on left turns because of so much of the weight
&gt;   of these things being on the left side of the van (kitchen, etc.)?
&gt;   If so, does anyone have any brilliant idea about how to prevent
&gt;   this potential?
&gt;
Can't help you there.   We've never felt instability of any kind with
the '82 westy diesel -- you see, the engine's got to be able to
get you to a decent speed before you can experience those things :-)
