Subject: 89 Vanagon Camper

&gt;I plan to have a mechanic look at it before buying it.  What should he
look for?  What kinds of problems are 89 campers prone to?  What is a
reasonable price to pay for it &quot;as is&quot;?  Any additional advice/cautions
would also be appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

My  2 cents

visual appearance of a vehicle is a good indication of how well it was
taken care of mechanically.  Is your mechanic a Vanagon expert?  If not, =
I
would proceed with caution.
