Subject:       Re: Dirty Car/Wheelwell Moldings

&gt; 
&gt; I know beestop (I think) makes wheelwell moldings in a universal model to fit
&gt; all cars, but I put these up to my vanagon and was uncertain if the look was
&gt; esthetically pleasing. 
&gt; 
Sorry I don't have anything to keep the mud off my Syncro. BUT don't 
get the Bestop fender moldings. They will pucker at every 
fastening point. They look really bad! 

I'd like to find something too. I don't mind the road film or wet mud.
The thing that is killing me is the sand picked up from the sandy road
that I live on. Behind each wheel is nicely sandblasted. 

Just face it, your a true four wheeler. A rig that's not dirty is not 
having fun yet...
