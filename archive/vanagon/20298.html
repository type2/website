Subject: Syncro Double Cab Sighting

I've just returned from a trip to the Columbia Gorge area, (my wife
and I love to windsurf), and while there, I saw a green Syncro double
cab in Bingen WA.

This trip was a right to left coast jaunt and with our 8 month old
son, we rented a Class A motor home. (No westy rentals in the Portland
area so no snide comments are necesary :-).

We were hanging at the Bingen Marina when I looked back and saw the
Syncro. He was leaving so I couldn't catch him. Seeing this vehicle
made me realize why Joel and others are in love with it.

BTW, the Gorge area seems like VW heaven. The westy is the perfect
board car for windsurfers who also live in their vehicle. Unfortunately,
not one of the owners I spoke to were aware of this list. I gave the
info to many VW owners while I was there so maybe we'll see a large 
influx of windsurfers on the list.

OK, back to work and off digest mode. 

My continuing saga with the dealer repairing my Vanagon is not completed.
The part that was ordered (as the service manager says &quot;I used the number
from the fiche&quot;) was wrong.

So I've been gone for over a week and there has been no progress on 
getting the vehicle back from the friggin' dealer. I'll end this note 
with the same line I ended my last post to this list:

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!
