&lt;&lt; The steering rack on my '86 Westi has finally sprung a leak under one of
 the tie rod boots.  Does anyone have any experience replacing the seals or
 does it require specialized tools?  I haven't been able to find a rebuilt
 rack for a reasonable price as most rebuilders don't have any in stock.  My
 only option seems to be to send mine off to be repaired but that would
 leave the bus on jackstands for a probably a month.  Does anyone in the
 RTP, NC area have a used (even leaky) rack that they would be willing to
 lend while I send mine off to be repaired?  If someone is willing to do
 this, please e-mail me directly.

I have rebuilt racks available.  $350 plus shipping.  Let me know if
interested.

Dennis
