Subject: FW: lowest mileage
Date: Thu, 20 Feb 1997 09:41:26 -0700

All this debate- It's funny.  I feel good about the 107K on my 90 Carat,
seeing as I bought 2 years ago with only 52K on it-  driven Chicago to
Maine, Colorado, Florida twice, and even to work a few times.  But, I
still feel good about my '75 911S with 25K on it.  I think the key on
the Vanagon side is to own a driver, and then a Syncro in the stable
with almost no miles just in case...

One can only dream...

&gt;&gt;Gregory,
&gt;&gt;Well said I was thinking the same thing.
&gt;&gt;Vws are intended to be driven and admired, not stored away out of sight.
&gt;&gt;Drive them hard, but with care and enjoy them.
&gt;
&gt;Yeah, that's essentially how I feel.  I'm planning on taking my beautiful,
&gt;low-mileage westie to South America and back.  (And the restoring it :-)
