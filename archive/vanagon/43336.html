&gt;This leads me to believe that the equivalent Weekender bed in a
&gt;Carat/Multivan
&gt;is at least an inch narrower than a normal GL Weekender.  Is this true?  The

&gt;guy who sold me the table also has the rear seat FRAME from the same wreck
&gt;but not the foam/upholstery seat and back :-(.  It doesn't seem like I could
&gt;mount my old seat on a compatible frame and still have sufficient clearance,
but 
&gt;somebody out there may know better.

I've made the following measurements on my two vans.  The 87 has the
weekender rear seat, but not the table/armrest walls that the 88 Wolfsburg
(and Carat &amp; MultiVan) has.

87 GL Syncro
Width across top of rear seat back: 59&quot;
Width across front of rear seat base: 60.75&quot;
Width wall-to-wall across top of rear seat base: 65.5&quot;

88 GL Wolfburg
Width across top of rear seat back: 58.25&quot;
Width across front of rear seat base: 57.25&quot;
Width wall-to-wall across top of rear seat base: 61.5&quot;

So, there appears to be a significant difference in the rear seats installed
in these models.  I don't think you could install the wider non-Wolfsburg
(non-Carat, non-MultiVan) seat into a van that has the table/armrest walls.
 Sorry for the bad news.

Good luck,
