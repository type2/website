&gt;No, no.  not those things you stick in your blummenvasen.  Light 
&gt;bulbs.  Anyone found a non-dealer, non-junkyard replacement for the
&gt;instrument lights in 
&gt;the vanagons?
&gt;
&gt;

Hella does market them.  they come in different wattages depending on use.
these are also used in Audi,s.  Good import auto supply should be able to
locate..
