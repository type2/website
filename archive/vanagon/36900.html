Chris P.
I have had an 87 Syncro for 3 years and would be glad to converse with you 
about it.
In my time of owning the van, I have had much maintenance done to it and 
could give you some things to look at.
I'd like to correspond directly with you but can't read message headers.
Please e-mail me!    :-)

later,
porter_fred%pax9_at_mr.nawcad.navy_dot_mil
relax and spin
87 syncro

|Help!
|
|I'm going to look at a Syncro (not a Westy)  tonight and need some advice.
|Its a 87 GL, 90k, and A/C.  The guy is asking $9,400 w/o replacing the 
heads
|and $10,400 with the heads done.
|
|I live in Seattle and every Tom, Dick and Harry wants a four-wheel drive
|around here.  Syncros, or for that matter any good condition late model
|Vanagon, sell like hot cakes and over blue book.  So why do I want to join
|the herd?  My wife and I spend our weekends climbing and back-country 
skiing
|the Cascades.  We drive lots of Forest Service access roads as well as Mtn
|passes.  Four wheel would be nice, but at what price?  We've only gotten
|stuck once in Billy-Rae (82 Oil Burner) but with a top speed of 60 mph, I
|think we need alittle more umpf.
|
|Here are my questions:
|1.  Are there bad or stay away years for Syncos?
|2.  How hard is it to &quot;do the heads&quot;?
|3.  How durable is the Syncro (tranny and such)?
|4.  I hear Syncro in incrediably hard (read expensive) to fix? Am I asking
|for trouble?
|5.  Is 90k of city driving harder on the Syncro than usual?
|6.  What kind of gas milage can I expect?
|7.  Would you buy it?
|
|The Syncro is in really nice shape, but.....
|
|Thank in advance for your help!
