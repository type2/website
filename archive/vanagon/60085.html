Hi, glad to forward my humble opinion.

My dad has one, I have one, my brother wishes he had one.

Dad has used his extensivley, for several years now.  Loves it.  Very trick
way to keep food fresh.  OK, you can't freeze stuff, but so what.  

Actually, you maybe could freeze stuf, they typically cool 40 degrees to 44
degrees below ambient, so if air is 40, does that mean it's 0 inside cooler. 
I havn't tried this, and certainly have not seen freezing in mine even though
I use it in the winter.

I have a newer one than dad has.  I recommend you look for the newer
technology one, you can tell because the box should say that it cools to 44
degrees below ambient.  Also check the box for cubic foot capacity.  At least
one I've seen is a bit smaller (cubic feet capacity) than the others, and
still comes in the same size packing box, and costs the same.  I saw a short
artical on the technology for the newer one in a Design News about a year ago.
 Looks like improvements in operation of the peltier junction.  4 derees
doesn't sound like much, but it is 10% improvement, and if it keeps the milk
from spoiling......

Sorry I can't list brands, as I sit here, I don't recall what I have.  I
bought mine at Fleet Farm here in the Twin Cities. (Burnsville actually)  I am
not aware of any clinkers.
