&gt; &lt;snip&gt; The original post seemed to idicate that the binding was

In my previous post on this subject, I said that our front wheel binding
was completely cured by balancing the tire pressures properly and
changing the differential gear oil for slippery synthetic. What I meant
by cured was that it still binds (as it should) in tight turns but now
it binds in a predictable non-severe manner. The binding that we were
experiencing after long trips on just straight driving was completely
eliminated.
