Subject: panamint trip this weekend


Here's the tentative roster for those attending Panamint Springs this
weekend.  Am still waiting for Al Knoll's post on this, our fearless leader,
who, unfortuantely has been away on vacation.  Al!:  we need your help!

It's my understanding form talking to Al on the phone last week that
they do have showers there, although someone might want to check this
officially, and that even if the 15 or so campsites there are
taken, that the group will be able to camp together in a nearby
adjacent open space.  From what i hear, the place is small, and people
should be able to find each other.  

This is this coming weekend.  Some will be arriving Thursday, and some
Friday.  There was previously scheduled a chili-cookoff for the 
weekend, involving the community, but I understand that the date
for that got changed to earlier in this week, so the proposal is
for the vanagon people to do their own.  On that note, a packing list
would be:

chili stuff
fire stuff, assuming fires are possible.  Al?
lawn/picnic chairs
food, drink, ice, etc.
