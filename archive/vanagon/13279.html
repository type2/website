Quoted from Joel on Wed, 15 Mar 1995:

   ok. there are entirely toooo many &quot;unknowns&quot; on the list. an Unknown is
   someone who hasn't fessed up as to which year/model/whatever bus they are
   driving/pushing/living in/etc.

Oh boy!  I've been found out.  Well, I am proud to say that I am no Wannabus.

I have a 1967 Microbus Deluxe.  Beigewhite and Salmon.  1776cc Dualport.  All
fixed up, except the rear wheel-wells were cut out by some demonic owner in
my poor busses past.  (Is there a support group for abused VW's?) &lt;grin&gt;
(Glad to say, I have located some wheelwells to get welded back in...  Now to
locate the $$$.)

Anyhow, I live in Alpine, UT, (30mi from Salt Lake City)  If anyone sees me,
remember to honk!  :)
