Subject: Vanagon Campers Wanted, For Rent &amp; For Sale

Dear Vanagon Friends,
A couple days ago I introduced myself, Tom Brouillette, in Albuquerque, 
NM.I'd like to enlist your help in finding Westfalia campers for the 
business that I run here: Roamin' Holiday. We rent them, mostly to 
tourists from out-of-state, and we need to add a few more to the fleet 
this year. We need ones with full camper interiors, and also water-cooled, 
with a strong preference for air-conditioning (such as it is, but our 
customers ask for it!).They need not be prefect, but should be clean and 
not abused (they will continue to live a good life here in the high 
desert). We would prefer to pay in the $8-10,000 range, but will listen 
to news of more expensive ones and consider.
 
We are quite willing to travel anywhere for them (we like to drive!), and 
are also happy to pay a &quot;finders fee.&quot;

For those who are curious about our business, I will be glad to send a 
brochure and rate information. We are also very willing to help folks 
plan their itinerary if they are unfamiliar with the Southwest, or need 
other help.

I can be reached at: rmart_at_unm_dot_edu   OR: (800) 969-8040 (Roamin' Holiday).

Also, a friend of mine has an '87 Westfalia Synchro for sale, 118K miles, 
with rebuilt motor installed by University VW here in ABQ at 92K. A 
rust-free Southwestern Westy. (We've decided to not use Synchros for the 
biz because we don't want to encourage recklessness, and we fear 
potentially expensive repairs.) For more info on the '87 Westy 
Synchro, call Jim at (505) 254-1626. Evenings usually best, but he's also 
around at random other times. 

Thanks for all your help.

Tom Brouillette
