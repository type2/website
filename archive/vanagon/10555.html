&gt; My mom had an orange '76 camper.  It was really cool.  The orange plaid
&gt; everywhere is awesome!

  If we all make it to the next camp out, you can revel in orange plaid and
  childhood memories to your hearts content in my '74. Personally, if I had
  been buying it new, I would have gone for the green.
