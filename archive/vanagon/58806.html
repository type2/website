Subject: Rear Sliding Window


I heard a loud OooHhh when the SA Caravelle was introduced to the
list. That was because of the rear sliding window. But hey, the middle
and rear windows of the SA Vanagons are a bit larger than our ones.

But during my search for the running board for Vanagons I found rear
sliding windows for our Vanagons to be exchanged with the regular
ones. Here is a list of available sliding windows for Vanagons built
in 9/79 until 7/90:

Middle left              alloy silver frame  DM 361.-
Middle left              alloy brown frame   DM 361.-
Middle right (until '84) alloy silver frame  DM 381.-
Middle right (until '84) alloy brown frame   DM 371.-
Middle right ('85 on)    alloy silver frame  DM 381.-
Middle right ('85 on)    alloy brown frame   DM 381.-
Rear   right             alloy silver frame  DM 371.-
Rear   right             alloy brown frame   DM 381.-

But don't forget, they are all brown doubled plexi glass. Maybe some
Westies have this kind of windows. The distributor (REIMO) ships
to foreign countries (usual disclaimer, prices are estimate).

BTW, I found the running boards, but only as a picture of a nice
van, not for sale :-(
