Dave,

We rented a 2.0l 4 cyl gas T4 (aka EuroVan) while in Grenoble
two years ago. It was a 9 passenger model with a 5 speed. We
too had no problem with it on the Autoroutes at 135+ klicks/hr..
never had problems going up and thru the alps in dry, wet or
snow.

In fact I found only a slight loss of power between my 5 cyl and
the 4 cyl versions. I asked our guide in Wolfsburg, he checked
into my observation and called someone while we were having
lunch, and the answer was that the 5 cylinder version as we
all know has more torque than the 4 cylinder version, but only
8 hp more than the 2.0L.

VW put the 5 cyl. in the US versions primarily because of
the torque characteristics of the engine would suit
having A/C, P/S, and auto-trannies, etc.. better than
the 4 cylinder engine.
