Don't feel so bad - I don't even HAVE a gas guage.

(Gas guage would've been pure _luxury_ for us.  We used to have to 
crawl back there while mum was driving, and suck the gas up with a 
straw to to see if there was anything in there!... 
A Straw!  You were lucky!, we used to....)

I bitched my gas guage didn't work, till I saw a bus that had no guage.
I bitched I had no guage, till I saw a bus which had no gas.
I bitched I had no gas, till I saw a man who had no BUS!
