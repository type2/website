&gt; We are getting several used items and want to know if these are
&gt; reasonable prices:
&gt; speedo/odo - 50 	(I thought it was illegal to sell these!)
&gt; fuel guage - 20	
&gt; sliding door lock mechanism - 50
&gt; driver's side window regulator - 40
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any idea if these are good prices or not?

Sounds a little high to me.  I think half of the prices you give is 
about what it would cost at the junkyards round these parts.
