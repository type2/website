Hi,

	I am just absolute freakin' estatic right now!

	This kid down the street, who just bought a '67 camper that was missing
a lot of stuff, and I, went to this this guy near here who has a lot of old
busses n stuff (including a T3 Ghia).

	I've scored parts from him before, and he's pretty reasonable.

	Well, for $65 (actual $32 - we split the cost) we got: 
	(you're not gonna beleive this!)_

	Early ribbed _rear_ bus bumper, with brackets! :)  YAHOO!
	bus steering column lock
	2 bus windshields
	2 light switches - early
	2 wiper switches, early
	horn button
	steering box
	ignition switch
	2 late bus turn signal lenses ('67)
	2 outside cargo door latches (no insides :()
	gas guage
	vaccum guage
	iside rear vie mirror
	slinding window latches
	turn signal relay
	a handfull of other doodads.
	
	I am on my way out to get some more goodies, like a bunch of inside
door handles!
	
	I offered him $50, he countered $70, and we settled on $65.

	This is not a hoax! :)

Thom
