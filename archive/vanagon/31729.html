Subject: Re: Gerbils and Air Inlet Caps! 

These are some sort of caps, I tired to install the metal tube extensions
for the air hoses and even a little sledge hammer wouldn't do the trick, I
started to look at a bug exahst and didn't see that little round hole in the
center so I deteremed those caps could be removed.  A pry with a heafty
screw driver and they came flying out, the old extentions dropped right
in...We had some new ones and they didn't fit.



&gt;
&gt;An oddness about the muffler is the fresh air inlet connection.  The
&gt;old one had a tube on each side that stuck up through the engine tin,
&gt;that you'd slide the air hose onto.  The new ones (apparently Danish
&gt;from the labels on them, although the invoice and catalog both claim
&gt;them to be German) have this kinda funky flanged thing instead of a
&gt;hole for the tubes.  A side view looks something like:
&gt;
&gt;      _                          _
&gt;       \                        /
&gt;        |                      |
&gt;        |                      |
&gt;        +------          ------+
&gt;        |                      |
&gt;
&gt;The diameter of the || parts is almost identical to the fresh air
&gt;hoses (i.e., you can get the end of the hose into the flange, but no
&gt;farther).  There's a flat plate with a hole in the middle of it a
&gt;little ways in, which appears to restrict the flow to about one third
&gt;of what it would otherwise be.  I suspect I did not get a normal
&gt;bug/bus muffler, although it was sold as being for VWs from 1963 until
&gt;sometime after 1971 (the catalog's not at hand at the moment, so I
&gt;don't know the cutoff date, but it's definitely after 1971).  I ended
&gt;up using some metal-ribbed rubber dryer hose and a clamp to hold it on
&gt;there.  It's going to make life interesting the next time the fan belt
&gt;decides to go on walk-about, and take the hoses with it.  Any ideas
&gt;what this sort of connector is meant to connect to?
