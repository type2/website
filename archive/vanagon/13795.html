&gt;   The question is now &quot;what to do&quot;? I was looking through the Rocky Mountain

&gt;   rebuilt than it is to buy all the parts to do it yourself &lt;?!&gt; Why is this?
&gt;   If the bus body is leaking under the windshield &lt;rust&gt;, is it worth putting
&gt;   a kilobuck or more into the engine?

Why do that?  Why don't you just replace the bearings?  If that's all that
is wrong, yer talking $100 (plus a lot of work, of course!).
