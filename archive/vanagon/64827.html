No, Lucien, '83.5 was the cut off for air cooled.  That's when it
suddenly dawn on them how inferior the air cooled engine was, and they
were so imbarrassed they didn't wait for the model year to expire before
making the subsitution.

and some of 'em were
&gt; not done in Germany.

That's just an excuse!



  Anyway, I would welcome buying tips as my wife and
&gt; I prepare to join this club (do I need to be a mechanic, for
&gt; instance?).

Ha, ha, ha! LOL!  OF COURSE YOU NEED A MECHANIC!  That's what this list
is all about!  We can't find decent mechanics, and this is a desperated
attempt to keep them running ourselves.  If you do find a mechanic,
latch on to him, don't let him go.  You might have noticed lots of
descussion about roof racks.  That's for holding the mechanic on long
trips.


  Also, how come I see so many 1987's for sale?  Something
&gt; wrong with that year?

Something is wrong with EVERY year!
