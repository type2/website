Subject: Aux Battery: cabin light wiring

&gt; One surprise,  the cabin light -the big one in the rear- is *not* connected
&gt; into the camper circuit, and will not run off the aux battery. The camper
&gt; circuits
&gt; only run the fridge on 12V, the annuciator panel that tells you the state of
&gt; charge and water level etc., and the water pump. I spent a bit of time
&gt; trying to figure out
&gt; why the my rear light would not work on the aux battery when I had the main
&gt; disconnected. Finally, I checked the Bentley, and saw that the circuit was
&gt; independent of the camper stuff, and thus the aux battery.
&gt;
&gt; (A listmember who could write some clear, detailed instructions for the FAQ
&gt; on connecting the rear light and the stereo to the aux system would make a
&gt; real contribution to our community. Me? No, I'm better at following
&gt; directions.)
&gt; 

The Bentley circuit diagrams show that the door lights, reading lights,
cigarette 
lighter and radio are all connected to FUSE #3. The 1986 (late) to 1989
years has central locking also connected. In the Westfalia the counter
light beside the rear seat on the LHS (cabib light) is connected also. 
In the Bentley Manual:	
	for 1886 (to VIN G 055 689) see page 97.76 
	for 1986 (from VIN G 055 690) see page 97.93,
	for 1987 see page 97.110,
	for 1988 and 1989 see page 97.128 and
	for 1990 and after see page 97.210.
If you remove the actual fuse from FUSE #3 holder and route a fused (15
amp) wire from the auxiliary battery to the after-fuse-post on FUSE #3,
then all of these lights and such will draw from your auxiliary battery.
You can never again drain your main battery by leaving lights on when
you are stopped/camping.
An easy route for the wire from the auxiliary batter to the fuse panel
is:
	from the aux battery out through the hole RHS of driver's seat,
	under the carpet along side of the driver seat inside of the emergency
brake handle,
	under the carpet, right of the drivers foot well,
	up behind the fresh/hot air outlet to behind the dash,
	across behind the dash and back down to the fuse panel.
