&gt;Let's keep these sightings and related info as a kind of continuing search
&gt;until we know one way or the other what VW is planning to do.

They (Winnebago) ARE bringing in the VR6 EV, presumably w/ the cab and
chassis; perhaps some resourceful soul can get ahold of one of these
from Winnebago and make something simple, like a single cab pickup or
something...

&gt;From a practical POV, VW (probably) wouldn't import the regular EV in any
trim level unless there was some market/pricepoint that it could fill
competitively.  Considering '93 EVs were about mid-teens to maybe mid
twenties new, and the new Winnie EV is, what, mid to high thirties, a reg-
ular VR6 EV in the mid to high twenties price range might be a bit much for
the &quot;regular&quot; minivan crowd to bear.  And we all know that there aren't
enough of us listers or list lurkers to make it worthwhile for VW to pull
this off.

I'm not hopeful of seeing the VR6 EV stateside, but I think the TDI EV would
be a pretty slick addition to the lineup, but one that's not likely to happen
either...
