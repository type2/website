&gt; R.A.VW about 2 years ago was the closest thing to a &quot;universal&quot;
&gt; VW list. Then the watercooled types wanted to split off and
&gt; caused such a stink about it that the aircooled types kind of
&gt; said &quot;up yours&quot; and ended up on Vintag.
&gt;
&gt; All thats left on R.A.VW is a mix of 90% watercooled and 10%
&gt; air (as opposed to about a 50/50 mix 2 years ago). I still
&gt; read r.a.vw for the odd air-cooled piece and to see if there
&gt; is anything that would be relavant to my 200k mile 86 GTI.

There is also another list called H20-VW that was created back in August
or so.  It was set up when there was a 'split' discussion to have separate
air- and water-cool groups.  I am on that list but I have not checked lately
to see if it was still active.  Last time I did there were about 25-30 
members with 1-5 messages monthly.
