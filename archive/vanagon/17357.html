Subject: Syncro Fuel Capacity

I have tested my fuel capacity extensively and I have one very valuable
piece of information: 

You may rest assured, even if your van is packed with stuff and you and
driving in hilly terrain, that once the needle gets to the bottom of the red
zone and it appears that you have *no* fuel left, that you can keep driving
for another 30 miles before you run out of gas. 

I guess you should test this on your own car by bringing along a gas can and
then running out of gas, but this is what I did and what I found. 

By the way, it is real bad to run out of gas as the fuel pump still operates
and it requires gas for lubrication.
