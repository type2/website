Hey all,
	OK, the time is getting close at hand.  I will likely be
	purchasing a 1978 VW bus within the next couple of weeks, maybe
	sooner (unless I get information about a certain other bus
	soon...).  At any rate, this bus has some minor problems and I
	would like group input to make sure that if they turn out to be
	major problems, they don't cost me too much.

	Here's the situation:
	1978 non-westy bus, air conditioning, heat works, no rust
	underneath, minor surface rust on body, one teensy-weensy rust
	hole in back, behind bumper (bondo patchable).  Has 160,000
	miles, clutch is good, transmission is good, differential is
	good, engine feels strong, starts right away, has fuel
	injection.  

	Here's where you come in:

	To get rid of the surface rust which is basically on the lower
	body, I plan to have the lower part of the bus sanded down to
	bare steel, primered, and painted.  How much do you think this
	would run?  I'm guessing around $500 but maybe less 'cause it's
	just half the bus but maybe more cause I don't know.  Help.
	Also, how much does a clearcoat generally add to the price?

	Speedometer.  It currently doesn't work.  I'm thinking that the
	cable has simply worked itself out of the hub, but if it's more
	serious, such as a broken cable or a busted speedo, how much to
	replace?  Can I probably find these parts in a junkyard?

	Wipers.  I've asked about this before, where there is no
	difference between low and high speed.  Some say switch, some
	say motor.  I guess electrical testing will reveal the culprit.
	Assuming switch, how much?  Assuming motor, how much?  Junkyard?

	Apparently the hazard flasher switch is the culprit in this
	bus's electrical goofiness, as when you wiggle it a bit, the
	problem goes away.  How much for hazard switch?  Junkyard?  I
	can probably live with this one.

	This thing has A/C which the owner claims works.  I will test
	before buying, but he says there's a special tube needed to have
	both A/C and heat hooked up at same time.  I'm not real clear on
	what he means, but I'll ask him next time I'm there.  Any air
	condition bus owners out there know what I'm talking about?  If
	this tube exists, how hard is it to get a replacement (he says
	the one he has is trashed).

	Right sun visor.  It needs one.  Are the A/C right sun visors
	the same size as the regular ones?  If so, I guess it will be
	pretty easy to obtain one.  Also are they all the same size for
	different years?

	Big chrome VW for front.  Also needs one.  How hard are these to
	get and how much?  Probably can find these at VW shows.

	The blue fresh air lever.  Currently, the knobby tip thing is
	broken off.  I can see from looking at Bentley that that seems
	pretty easy to replace and can probably find one in a junkyard.
	Right?  Also, the fresh air lever is out of adjustment.  When
	all the way up, it should be closed completely and when all the
	way down it should be open completely.  Well, it only goes down
	about half way, so I'm assuming that when it's up it's not
	closed all the way.  I know that the thing is adjustable.  How
	hard is it to get to?

	That's about it.  If I discover any more problems, I'll let you
	know.  I'd really appreciate any and all responses as this is a
	big thing for me.....

	Thanks,
	Sean
