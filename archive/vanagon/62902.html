&gt;Hello

&gt;I've seen references to something called engine flushing, I believe. I
&gt;suppose it to be a way to clean out old gunk when changing the oil.
&gt;Somebody mentioned ATF-fluid.
&gt;Is this something to bother about? If so, could somebody tell me how and
&gt;when it is done?


	I just did this last week. I have also heard that you can use ATF,
but I used a product that I think was called engine flush, the manufacturer
is Gunk. You just put it in the crankcase, making sure you aren't
overfilling with that addition, let the engine idle for 5 minutes, then
drain it and put in new oil and a new filter. You can't drive it during the
flush, or rev the engine.
	I did it for 2 lifters that wouldn't pump up. I had tried another
product by JB that you add to the oil and drive normally, changing the oil
within 1500 miles, but it didn't help my noisy lifters. The gunk product
worked fine, the lifters are now quiet.
	I was warned later by Kyle Wade of Volks-Motorsports that He's seen
the flush products cause problems(not the one by JB, He's the one who
recommended that one to me). Apparantly they can kick so much junk loose
that they can cause a problem with the oil pump, so be careful if you use
it and watch your oil pressure afterwards.
