Subject: LED Reading Light

Something I remembered last night - I have recently seen somewhere (probably a
trade journel, maybe &quot;Machine Design&quot;????) that a blue LED is now available. 
&quot;So what&quot;  you say?  Well, if you bunch blue, green and red  LEDs together and
they are reasonably matched in output you get WHITE light!!!  In fact I
remember that was pointed out in the article as an option.  Now if I could
remember WHO manufactured this  . . . .

As for Cetin's polite correction (to which I take no offense):

&gt;2)  BUT !!!!!!!  I vaguely recall from a class taken almost 30 years ago - 
&gt;that the current draw of the diode at applied voltages above the device
design
&gt;point (apparently 2.5 volts in this case) is only limited by the value of the
&gt;series resistor, so you want to define the conditions you want at the diode

*Yes, for ideal diodes.

What can I say,  it was an undergraduate class and we all know the &quot;delta&quot;
between &quot;class room&quot;  and the &quot;real world&quot;.   I'm modestly amazed that I
remembered what I could!  :-)
