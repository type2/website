Ok,

So I left out some details in my previous post. =)

BUS DETAILS:
The bus I have originally had the two seats in it(the three seater in 
the back, and the
two seater mounted to the floor in front of it.), but I decided that I 
liked the camper interior instead.  So I bought this really beat to 
sh*t '68 camper for $120.  The interior
was real bad, but the hardware was in ok shape.  So, I took all the wood and
hardware out of it, cut new plywood for the seat backs and bottoms, and 
went to the
fabric store where I picked up new 4&quot; foam for the seats and the very 
back.  I  also
got some black vinyl(looks and feels like leather) to recover these new 
seats with.
 Armed with my trusty staple gun, in about 4 days, I had completely 
replaced the interior with new seats.  So now I have this killer fold 
out bed in my bus, and the
vinyl is holding up really well.  All for about $300.

I even had some extra plywood to put a sheet down underneath the rubber mat.

Next pre-trip step was to put curtains in.  I went to the junk-yard and 
picked up some
curtain rods from a junked bus, and put new curtains in(my SO did help 
me with this,
I did take home-ec in the 7th grade also, but wanted a second opinion), 
so I did
about half the sewing on the curtains.
I also popped in a Sony CD player and some Alpine speakers, which were a dream
on this trip.

FOOD DETAILS
As for food on our expedition, we ate out on the rare occasion(maybe 4 
times the
whole trip), and my diet mainly consisted of:

Fanstasic Foods cup a soup thingys- These are Low Fat soups that require
hot water, and they taste just killer.  Plus they have cool names like 
Serenadin
Minestrone.
Ry Krisp
Fruit Juice
Fresh fruits
Lots and lots and lots of water.
Garden of Eatin Black Bean and Chili Chips
Many cans of Beans.

I have been on a healthy eatin kick for the last 6 months or so, so 
believe me, findin
grocery stores to buy food in was a problem at times.
We had a little coleman single burner propane stove(it screws on to the 
top of a
propane bottle) to heat water with, so all in all I feel we ate pretty well.

QUESTION
I do have a question for y'all tho?  The seals on my doors are totally 
shot. Where
would be the cheapest place to find replacements.  I was wondering if they make
like a bulk stripping that could be used in the VW's, or do I have to 
go with the
premade ones that cost $$$$   $70+ just for the slider.  I don't want 
all this work I've
put into the bus to go to waste, but she leaks like a pasta strainer right now.

Any advice greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Jon
