Subject: Re: Cabtop Cargo Carrier?

Thanks for the ideas. We have a store chain here called &quot;SportsRack&quot; and 
they also suggested the canvas carrier idea, but there is no way to 
adjust it to differing sized loads. I think it would be better if it was 
more rigid to help with the streamlining, etc. 
 
Does anyone know if there is one made in Germany? Sort of the same idea 
as the camp tent sold there, but not imported for some reason.
 
I wonder how many folks would be interested in such a cargo carrier? Does 
anyone know if all the models of Westfalias have the same size cargo area?

Thanks again all - Jack
