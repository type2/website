Subject: Re: Bentley manuals and sainthood



&gt;I'd like to say enough of the pontificating about how good Ron's book deal 
&gt;is, it is the same price as available from nearly any quality supplier of 
&gt;Bentley manuals, no better, no worse.  Ron makes the money, not someone 
&gt;else, if you think this is good so be it. None of us are saints, but $68 
&gt;for a Bentley manual does not qualify him as one either. 

Just to correct a factual error, the price for the Bentley Vanagon manual 
is $62 (plus postage), not $68.  This *is*, in fact, lower than anyone 
else's advertised price.  Not that this qualifies me for sainthood... :)
