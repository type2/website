Subject: pretour (west) info


Thanks to all of you who responded to both the list, and via private
e-mail as to your wishes on our pre-tour warmup (west-coast).  A 
significant number of you expressed a preference for early
January (brrrrr), specifically the weekend of Jan. 7, 8, &amp; 9,
which I think we should aim for.  

I phoned Pfeiffer in Big Sur.  As I mentioned, they unfortunately
do not have group sites available at that time of year, and they
also do not offer electrical or water hookups.  They can accomodate
us hopefully with adjacent private sites, perhaps with more than
one vehcile per site.  Other advantages are a huge park, easy
access to hiking trails, groceries, propane, etc.

I also phoned the Big Sur private campground, which does offer
water and electric hookups.  They, too, do not have group sites.
Disadvantages are:  hiking, propane, and groceries not nearby.

Both offer hot showers!  :)

Also phoned a few other nearby campgrounds, but they will not
be open reliably at this time of year if there is a storm
at that time, so our space reservation would not be secure in
that event.

Anyway, I need to hear from those of you who plan to attend
which of these settings you prefer.  I suppose it boils down
to:  do you favor heat and water, or nearby propane and groceries?
