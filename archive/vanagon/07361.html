&gt; March of this year.

Wishful thinking, Joel.
Gerry bought a Vanagon March 7, 1994 and soon after started perring 
around in corners of the net to locate a source of information.  Finally 
I stumbled on rec.autos.vw.  There I found, in the FAQ, the forementioned 
list address.  After an unsuccessful attemp to subscribe, I posted to the 
newsgroup.  This met with a history lesson by Joel.  In a last ditch 
attempt to contact some Vanagon owners who could help me with my then 
current problem (passing smog in MN) I got him to send me a list of names 
that he had collected.  This I formed into a Unix mail alias and invited 
the 30 members to use.  About a week and half after that I realized that 
the mail alias was not going to control this monster, so on April 2, 1994 
the vanagon listserv went online.  To our shock and suprise within a 
month we had 100 members.  From there, it's just gotten bigger and better 
and crazier.
None of this would have happened without Joel's help and support.
It also doesn't happen without the support and patience of all the 
members of this list.  Thanks.


PS. If you were wondering why I'm in such a good mood, it's because my disk 
came in. &lt;grin&gt;
