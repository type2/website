Subject: van trade?


I was wondering if anyone would like to trade
a nfairly good condition bus for a '7slightly rusintty
'77 that flowwods immediately upon starting?
 
Barring a trade, I would also be happy to find anyone that
would lend/rent me an airflow snesensor or ECU to try and pin
down the problem I am having....

Many thanks, enjoy the weekend....


Matt
