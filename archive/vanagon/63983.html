&lt;&lt; I'm in search of a 93 Eurovan Westfalia Weekender to replace the one I
 rolled a few weeks ago.  The weekender (without the stove, etc.) is VERY
 hard to find, as they were only imported in 1993.
 
 Please email kndgrn_at_manoman_dot_com if you know of one available for sale.  Or
 call 415-626-6626.  I am in northern california, but will extend my search
 to the lower 48.  I really like these vans.
  &gt;&gt;

Buy a used Eurovan GL, and buy back your rolled EV weekender from the
insurance co, and make your own??  
Sounds crazy, but it prolly will be easier and more cost effective than
trying to locate another '93 weekender??  And you'll have your old EV for a
parts vehicle!!  :&lt;)
just a thought... :&lt;)
