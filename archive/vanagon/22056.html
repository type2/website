Subject: august campsite


The BLM kindly snail-mailed me a lot of materials on this area
we are considering for the August 25-27 campsite, which Wes
spoke so highly of (I posted a copy of his kudos earlier today).  Anyway,
the campground I mentioned earlier--Wailoki (sp?)--is the one I have
my eye on, and I'm going to dig pretty deep into reading thru
the stuff tonite.  So far, I think this is our safest bet to
get away from the Winnebago/RV/generator crowd, and I'll pursue
this, and give you all a report soon.  I know from speaking
with the BLM person at the Arcata office on the phone a few
days ago that these campgrounds are all first-come, first-serve
with no reservations, so we'll just have to chance it, with perhaps
some fail-safe backup way of getting messages to others who may
need to arrive late on Friday, the 25th.  Also, keep in mind
that while we are supposed to be getting a spot which is
phenonemally beautiful, rustic, unadulterated, that we probably
WON'T be getting the usual amenities such as:  showers, toilets,
AC, water, etc.  That means we need to truck a lot of stuff
in, and be prepared for being as self-sufficient and as self-
containted as possible.  If *I* can go w/o showers, I'm sure
the rest of you will manage....:)
