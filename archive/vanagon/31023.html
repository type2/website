Subject: I have a 71 camper now!

Hello everybody... Well.. I just wanted to tell everybody that after 
months of lurking on the list, I now own a 71 camper... and I got it at 
the rockbottom price of $50 from a friend.. 

The only problem is it needs some rust work done, repainted, and a 
complete engine rebuild.. but this isn't so bad..

What is bad is that there is no type of instructions on how to use some 
of the things in there... guess I will have to learn on my own...
