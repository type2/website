Subject: Re: Wiring ?

All the light assemblies were removed and replaced but I took them off and
checked it looks like the tail light plugs attach only one way, the front
indicator lights have a chance of being miswired so I tried different hookups
but while it switched the indicator and turn signal brightness it didn't
change the frequency, nor the the tail light color, the amber lens instead of
red. Any other ideas?
