Hey, guys, can I come, too?
I would be coming all the way from Stanford in my '73 camper.
I love pizza, and I can even pay my share. :)

At this rate, there will soon be a Middlefield Rd., Palo Alto Vanagon
gathering:
North America Tour--&gt;Western States Loop--&gt;Big Sur Weekend--&gt;Bay Area
Pizza Lunch--&gt;???  ;)

Hope we can get together.  If we're doing this by Pac-Bell instead
of by internet, I can be reached at 723-0321, where I supposedly work.
