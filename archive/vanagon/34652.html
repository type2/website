&gt;the only way i would see that speed is coasting _down_ the hill in neutral

Since production of the beetle and loafs shifted to Mexico ALL models have 
been given five-speed gearboxes.  'Neutral' will henceforth be refered to as 
'overdrive' in marketing and traffic fatality bulletins.  Gear shift knobs 
are to indicate this with an M in place of the older N, indicating Mexican 
overdrive has been installed in the vehicle.
