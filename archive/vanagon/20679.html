Subject: Re: Bodywork ... advice?

My understanding from my father that used to work with a couple of  
guys that were masters at doing lead body work, was that it takes  
quite a knack to do it and lots of practice. Which you are right  
makes it expensive and rare.  As for a paint gun I bought the $35.00  
Harbor Freight special and have been very happy with it.  I will be  
the first to admit I am not much of a painter, but the gun seems to  
do its part.

&gt;I have some body work to do on my bus.  Mostly small dents and the  
&gt;such.
&gt;I was pondering using a lead body filler.  Has anyone gone this &gt;route 
&gt;before?  I read that this method was abondoned because of the time  
&gt;and costs
&gt;involved. Also, I am also still looking for a
&gt;paint gun and I can't find a decent one at a resonable price  
&gt;locally.  Does
&gt;anyone know of a mail-order company which sells brand name guns?   
&gt;Thanks in
&gt;advance.

&gt;Chris.
