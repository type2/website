Subject:      Re: Battery Size??

Hi Guys,

Many thanks for all the replies.  I have now tried turning the passenger
seat a full 180 degrees and then sliding it all the way back - lo &amp; behold,
it give full access to the battery compartment!

Can anyone pin down the exact model number of an Interstate 850 CCA that
will fit?  I've been very confused by all of Interstate's offerings (see
their web site at:   http://www.interstatebatteries_dot_com), and anyone I
phone says only a 650 CCA version will fit.




Thanks
