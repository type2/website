Subject: Summer East Coast Bussing....

Howdy all- with all the talk of summer, and even spring bus activities, I
thought I'd go ahead and tell everyone about the North Carolina BlUe Ridge
Parkway - Outer BAnks Trek (NCBuRPOBaT), so you could begin thinking about it,
and making plans, etc...
 Anyway, Busses on The Parkway is a NEATO event from Friday, May 30 through
Sunday, June 1. It is a wonderful event, woth lots of busses and friendly
folks.
I don't have anything official to do with that, except for the fact that I'm
going again. However, from there, Some bussers are planning to make a leisurely
trip to the Outer Banks of the NC coast. These are the barrier islands, full of
national seashores, and a really wonderful place overall. We'll take &quot;medium
roads&quot; from the mountains to the coast. By this I mean roads smaller than the
big highways, but better than backstreets...
 Anyway, the whole thing will occupy basically the first week in June. We'll be
staying at national Seashores, which are basically national parks. It costs
around $14.00 per campsite per night, although 2 vehicles are allowed in a
site.
 So, mark those calendars now, and I hope to see you in June! I'll probably
attempt a rough headcount later on, just to guage the scale of this thing, as a
trip with 5 busses is quite a bit different than a trip with 15...
Happy Friday!
