Subject: Re: Propex Heater

mwagner of the type2 list asked:

&gt;(snip) He mentioned a Propex heater
&gt;that had been installed en masse by the Type2
&gt;list... anyone have details on hand about these?

I've seen a few inquiries lately, so here is a replay for all:

Last fall I organized a group purchase of twenty Propex heaters
between the type2 and vanagon lists. These are small units
you see installed in VW campers in Europe all the time;
5100 BTU sealed combustion units that fit under the rear seat.
Mine's is in and works great.

The group effort saved a little money on the purchase, and a lot 
of money on the shipping from England and the customs
fees. Delivered cost for the group members about $450 each, vice
$600 for individual purchase. There is no US distributor.

To get the whole (and then some) Propex story, check Gerry's archives
with the following:

Tom Carrington has kindly posted a photo of my installed Propex at

(Note, I'm back from vacation and will be getting to all my 
e-mail soon).
