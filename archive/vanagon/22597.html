&gt; Well, continuing to search for stuff the the 76' westy.  Here is what I 
&gt; am trying to find.  Looking for used on most--
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  Water pump for sink--This is the outside of the tank type that      
&gt;     hooks on the bottom.

An RV store.  Should be able to get a 1.5 gal/min one (WHOOOSH!) for 
about 15 bucks.  Compare THAT to VW's price!
&gt; 
&gt; 4.  Plastic Handles with the push buttons for the cabinets              
&gt;     inside--prefer black if possible.

Bone-yard.  Bring the family!
