Subject: bodega/oyster crackers


We need oyster crackers!  Help:  I've run out of time, and I know
some of you haven't even gone to the store yet.  I'll be leaving
in the morning early to get to Bodega asap, to save as many sites
as possible.  

If somone has some of these crackers for our clam chowder, or would
be willing to stop and get some, would you please do so, and post
your intention to the list, so that your efforts are not duplicated?

Thanks!
