     &gt;If you are on the list then I beg you to not turn any other treasures 
     &gt;into wood haulers or bajas!!! Grumble, grumble, grumble...

     conversion on (really!) is a big no no ????
     
     I've got the bumpers, the roof section, semiphores, little lights 
     etc.. and an angle grinder ;)
