Subject: 1988 Westy, oil and brake problems

Hello friends, i am helping a friend out with his new 1988 westy acquistion,
it supposedly had an engine rebuild 16k ago, yet it burns a quart of oil
every 700 or so miles.  maybe that is not much to complain about, but i
hardly burn any oil in my 85.  Well he went thru the problems with the
non-20w-50 oil and the oil light, and he had his oil changed and still the
blinking oil light comes on, he had the oil pressure switch replaced and the
problems are still there, after a long day of driving he had the light come
on and also the buzzer. 

Any input?

Also he had the brake pads replaced and when pressing the brake pedal he
gets the pulsing sensation, bad rotors, right??


Thanks in advance for any help at all.
