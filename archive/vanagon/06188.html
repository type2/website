Subject: Re: First oil change


Heat is the killer here.  Do what you want, but keep it cool, the friction
from new parts causes much extra heat, then more expansion, more heat etc.

Watch that temp guage!


On the &quot;new&quot; motors, they are allegedly &quot;pre broken-in&quot;.  What the 
factory does to accomplish this I dunno.

Since, I'm a cynic and a skeptic, I changed the oil at 1k on a &quot;new&quot;
car and 500 miles on a rebuild.

 &gt;&gt; So, which is more severe, 10 miles in stop and go traffic, or 50 miles at
 &gt;&gt; 65mph, through mountainous, sometimes freezing conditions?

 &gt;&gt; At first I was gonna vote for the 10 miles in traffic but isn't 65 mph just
 &gt;  about full-tilt-boogie in a '71 bus???
