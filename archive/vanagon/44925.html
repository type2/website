Subject: Oil cooler placement?
Date: Fri, 21 Jun 1996 18:38:51 -0700

Ok, ONE more time...: )

        I bought the second oil cooler today from the place that was
supposed to install it two days ago...: (, now I know why I learned to do
all this stuff in the first place...

        The oil cooler is the DERALE brand cooler with the 10&quot; electric
fan, part number 15800, same exact one Bernie Bergman sells. It will not,
repeat NOT fit in the engine compartment, so half of you will be
dissapointed and the other half pleased : ). It will also NOT fit above the
tranny, however the one place it will actually fit is under the chassis,
drivers side, kind of ahead of the drain for the sink (yes it's a 77
Westy), and the front of it is against the front crossmember( I
think)...I'm a little concerned about the front tire kicking up mud and
water onto this thing. I plan on using stainless braided hose, so rocks and
such shouldn't be an issue. Ground clearance is higher than my propane tank
so that doesn't seem to be a problem.

        Does this seem like a decent place to put it? I tend to think
putting it in the engine compartment would not be good, and since I'm going
to use braided hose, I think it should be ok in that department. Has anyone
installed one of these models before? What about the power for the fan,
what would be a good source for the power for that?

Sorry this is so long, but I've been trying to leave for a week now, and
really need to get this thing installed. I think it can't hurt, can only
help keep the oil cooler than it is now, and since I'll be driving
something close to 10,000 miles in one month, the cooler the better! : )

Any and all advice greatly appreciated!  Thanks, TOM
