Well Howdy:

The EV air-conditioning is indeed CFC-free.  Does
that mean that punitive taxes should not apply?
(I have never owned an air-conditioned vehicle,
so I know nothing of these regulations).  As well,
I have not purchased a new vehicle since gas
consumption became an issue (my Lotus Super Seven
was quite abstemious!).

The vehicle in question is the long-wheelbase
Eurovan, camperized (is that a word?) by Winnebago.

To eliminate confusion, see this site

That's the beast!

thats not a big

&gt; 
&gt; What does it take to qualify as a gas-guzzler there?
&gt; And I didn't think it had flourocarbon air conditioning - 
or does everyone
&gt; in Canada have to pay for past transgressions?
