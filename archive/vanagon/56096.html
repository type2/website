Subject: 91 Vanagon wiring diagrams???

Does anyone have a wiring diagram for the heater/defroster blower motor for
a 91 Vanagon GL 4 spd?  I am having a problem blowing fuses but don't own a
manual of any type to check things out.  If anyone has a copy of this
diagram and can either e-mail or fax it to me, I would greatly appreciate
it.
