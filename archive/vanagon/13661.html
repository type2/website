Subject:       VW Ignition Arc-Over

Import Service, Nov/Dec '87 Vol 1, No 1

&quot;Any model VW equipped with metal-shielded spark plug wires and/or 
distributor caps may develop a rough idle or a part-throttle misfire. 
 These problem can be caused by secondary ignition voltage arcing 
over to these metallic shields.

To inspect the distributor cap properly, you must remove the shield 
[and in Dan's opinion, leave it off].  Check the wires and cap for 
small white spots.  The spots indicate that voltage is leaking to the 
metallic shields.  Replace any caps or wires that show signs of 
arc-over.&quot;

Dan's Note:
also look for BLACK spots on the plug wires.  the resistance may be 
fine but a burn-thru in the insulation may still be present.  remove 
that metal shield on the dist cap and throw it away.  clean the 
exterior of the cap good and keep it clean.  brush and floss daily.
