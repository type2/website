Its not too expensive to do here in Canada. I got used, but in good
condition, H-4s from a wrecker for Can$30/pair. One had a 65/55W bulb, the
other a 100/80W. (strange combo, the 100/80W was on the passenger side). A
new 65/55W bulb is about Can$8.00.
You can get clear (but turn a bit amber over time) plastic lense covers to
protect your investment.

But now I have the &quot;I ain't got the big mutha wire from the batt'ry to
d'lights&quot; blues.
