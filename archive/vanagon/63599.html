Subject: A/C compressors Sanden 508 vs 510

Hey, all...Today I got a a/c compressor (Sanden 508) off a '86 Golf, for 20
bucks at a local junkyard...spun it, sounded good, and when i cut the freon
lines, it spewed out a whole bunch of R12 freon into the atmosphere
(yea...yeahh..  :&lt;), so i knew the system was fully charged, and the
compressor was probably good. (man...that stuff makes you hallucinate...)

Now the a/c compressor on my '87 is a Sanden 510, and the 508 looks just like
the 510, but the lines exit on the opposite side (the same end, but on the
right instead of the left...or vise-versa..anyway, you get my point...)
Someone had mentioned on the list before about using a Golf/Jetta etc. 508 on
a Vanagon...what did you do about this problem? The freon lines into the 510
on the Vanagon are metal, and dont bend too easily...  :&lt;)  (the freon lines
right out of the 508 on the Golf were rubber hoses)
There is a &quot;plug&quot; or bolt in the top center of the compressor (both the 508
and the 510 have this) is there a &quot;right side up&quot; to the compressor? (ie.,
can you mount the compressor w/ this &quot;plug&quot; or wide head bolt, down?) I held
the 508 over the engine compartment, and if you mount it &quot;upside down&quot; then
the lines exit to the same side as the 510....
So, those of you who have used a Golf/Jetta/etc. 508 in their Vanagons, what
did you do?

any ideas?
chris
