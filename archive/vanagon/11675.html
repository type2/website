Subject: Overflow while filling the gas tank

I'm still getting used to my new Vanagon and am wondering if this is some
quirk that you all have learned to deal with.  Anyway, we were all set to
begin the 180 mile trip back home.  I'm standing at the pump filling the
tank when, like a teenager forcing down that last tequila sunrise, it
suddenly fills up and spits back this huge spray of gasoline that gets all
over my coat, shoes and gloves.  So the whole way home we get to enjoy
those wonderful fumes -- yuck!  Has anyone else experienced this?
