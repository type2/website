&gt; 	I've heard Simple Green spray cleaner spoken of well as a 
&gt; degreaser- for bicycle chains for example. Anyone tried doing engine
&gt; tin with it?  

I used it full-strength on engine tin and the gas tank cover 
recently -- did a pretty good job. I've also filled a tub with
warm water and a couple of handfuls of TSP (tri-sodium-phosphate)
and soaking the smaller pieces in that.
