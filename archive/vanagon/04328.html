&gt; 
&gt; How many other people have tried using ATF for cleaning their sticky
&gt; valves? Which type has been used. I need to try this to save big-time
&gt; expense!
&gt; Thanks.

	I assume you're referring to sticky lifters (plungers).....

	ATF is an old farmers solution. 

	My '91 had a problem with (1) lifter....The noise usually went away
	after about 10 seconds. But, after the rig sat unused for ~ 9 months, it
	got real bad.

	I almost embarked on a rocker assy. removal and plunger replacement.
	Fortunately, I happen to be gabbing with a motorhead at work about it.
	He said 'Buy a pint of Risoline (or something like that(made in Wis.))
	and add to oil for ~500 miles.

	I did and the noise is gone, even at startup.

	His contention was that varnish buildup was probably clogging one of
	the oil fill holes in the lifter.
