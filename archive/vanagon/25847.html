Subject: '72 Bus Engine

I know that the '72-'73 buses had the 1679cc engine (the same was used in 
the VW 411,411 and Porsche 914).  It has considerably more power than the 
1579cc used in the earlier years.  I've heard rumors that this engine is 
very expensive to work on and parts are hard to find.  Is this true?  I am 
considering a '72 that seems to be in very good condition.  Should the 
engine be considered a potential problem point if everything else is fine?
