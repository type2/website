&lt;&lt; In my searching through local Boston papers I have not seen an '85
Westfalia
 for as low as $2,000.  For that price I have seen much older ones.  Have I
 been looking in the wrong (high roller) places?   I entered some data into
&gt;&gt;


ACTUALLY,  I meant that '85 westy GL's in comparable shape, in the northeast,
can be had for about $2000 less than $6200......

I've seen a few local (allentown pa) '85 westy GL's sell for around
$3500-$4000 w/ 75 to 130k+ mi..
tho they can be had for less.... like an '85 westy GL for $800 bucks...
 (certain Ohio listmember..  ;&lt;)

you need to broaden your search, and dont jump on the first one you
find....there are cheap ones out there...some may need a little TLC, but you
can find a good deal..
there was an '87 westy GL that sold thru the GASS newsletter last winter for
$1700..(17hundred bucks).....
