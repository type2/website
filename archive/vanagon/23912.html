Subject: rebuilt GEX 1600sp update, longish

          update on '66 kombi/_dot_camper with rebuilt GEX 1600sp.
          the 300 mile checkup went well.  oil was clean clean.
          changed it anyway.  cleaned screen and deep sump.  traces of
          lithium type stuff, which i assume was used in the rebuild.
          #'s 1 &amp; 2 valves were spot on, 3 &amp; 4 were a little tight.
          the farthest forward bottom case bolt was weeping and when i
          went to tighten it the bolt started pulling out of the case.
          will try again to today to get GEX to respond to my 2 or 3
          problems with this motor.  i'd like to purchase the 3 year
          warranty but not until they talk to me about these problems
          and their willingness (?) to work with me on warranty being
          that i am doing my own service and the warranty speaks of
          authorized service.  too much small print.  anyway, this is
          the smoothest running, quietest, coolest (temp), and easiest
          to adjust motor i've ever had.  the temp gauge stays right
          at 180 F and fires right up (now that i've adjusted the
          choke properly).  the passenger side of the motor (#'s 1&amp;2)
          is shimmed behind the rocker assembly and the driver's side
          is not.  this concerns me a little in terms of proper
          geometry for the valves but it does put the adjusters in
          about equal setting.  does this indicate anything to you
          more experienced motorheads?  does this affect compression
          or valve wear?  i'm almost at the 500 mile check where i'll
          run a compression test and recheck the valves and change the
          oil again.
          one very positive thing that came out of this work is that
          when i replaced the motor i made sure i had an excellent fit
          at heater boxes and all exhaust connections.  it IS tight,
          quiet, and for the first time since i've owned the bus it
          has HEAT without exhaust fumes!!  i know, i live in florida
          right, but it does get into the upper teens in the winter
          and we do go camping in the beast in north carolina in
          late october.  heat will be welcomed.  we tried it out last
          weekend while driving through the ocala forest on the way to
          kevin murray's vw ranch and i got many a complaint from
          passengers front and rear.  SUCCESS!!
          overall, i'm happy but i would feel so much better if GEX
          would talk to me about warranty.  still no solution to door
          hinge plate troubles but i'm determined to do something this
          weekend.  rusty's idea is possible but scary but so is
          yanking a motor the first time, right?    ray
