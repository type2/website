Subject: Re: Electric Heaters

&quot;12 volt electric heaters do not heat&quot;--Albert Einstein from his little 
known treatise &quot;Heating Aircooled VWs without the use of Thermonuclear 
Reactions&quot;  

On a related note, I was reading a review on the Ford Ecostar, an electric 
vehicle based on the European Escort utility van.  The Ecostar uses sodium 
sulfur batteries (which are able to store 3-4 times the energy of lead acid 
batteries).  Ford's engineers decided not to use an electic heating system 
because the energy required would cause a severe reduction in range.  
According to the article, some electric cars that use electric heat can 
have their 100-150 mile range reduced by up to 75%!  Instead, the Ecostar 
uses a diesel fueled heater.

Maybe there's a place for our gasoline heated buses in the 21st century!
