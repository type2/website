Subject: vent question


In my '81 westy, there are four vents on the horizontal part of
the dash.  The two towards the center are I assume for defrosting, but
not sure about the two at the edges, near the vent windows (NOT
the ones on the vertical surface).  Anyway, these two vents I am
talking about seem to have no lever or nob to turn the air off or
on, or to deflect it in a certain direction.  Further, once the
car is warmed up, they blow hot air all the time, no matter
where I have set any of the other levers or nobs in any location
in the car.  Do others of you have this?  Is this normal?  If
so, doesn't it seem STRANGE????
