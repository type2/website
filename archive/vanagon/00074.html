]well, my understanding from what i thought i understood from the literature
]is that
]
]Kombi - basic bus. basically no interior in the rear section, but it did
]        have seats. in the Vanagon, this was changed to have interior, but
]        it was lesser quality, and the seats were all vinyl, rubber mats on
]        the floor, and no sliding windows in the middle windows.

The Vanagon Kombi sounds like it was equiped much like my pre-Vanagon 7-pass
buses.  The thing I most dislike about my Vanagon vs. my previous buses is
that I can't clean it out with a garden hose.  I really miss that.

]Vanagon/Caravelle - interior was better quality, sliding windows in the
]        middle. in early days, u.s. models could still get rubber mats and
]        vinyl seats ('standard' model, like my 1980), but 'L' models (and
]        later 'GL' models) got carpet on the floor and cloth seats.

Rubber mats for a Vanagon?  Would they be easy to retrofit to my '84 GL?
Are they readily available?  I thought when I got this thing I asked at my
local VW dealer and was told they weren't available for an '84 Vanagon,
but it might be as simple as getting mats for an earlier one.  I can live
with the cloth seats (they're more comfortable when you get into a hot bus
here in Texas, anyway) but my carpet looks like you'd expect in a utility
vehicle with 110,000 miles on it.

BTW, what's a Caravelle?  I thought that was a Renault ripoff of a Karmann
Ghia.  Is VW using that name for the Typ II in other markets?

]that's the way i understand it to be. anybody know different? i'm getting this
]from some german books and german magazine ads (and german sales brochures
]for the Transporter).  at least, that's what i get from the pictures. :)

Ummm....  If these are German sources, how much could they apply to U.S.-
spec VWs?  I know they've sold quite a few models in Deutschland that we
have never seen on this side of the pond.
