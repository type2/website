I remember reading something in Muir's 'idiot guide' about putting moli
D oil ( I THINK that's it) to help with howling and getting it in gear
just to get you through until you have the bread to do the fix, might
want to check it out:&quot;How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive: A Step by Step
Manual for the Complete Idiot.&quot;

&gt; 
&gt; Hi all:
&gt; 
&gt; Last week my transmission started making a howling or whining noise
&gt; (not 
&gt; too bad yet) in 1st and 2nd gear.  Not surprising since the trans has 
&gt; more than 200,000 miles on it.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, a few questions:
&gt; 
&gt; Any experience or anectdotes about how long from the time you start 
&gt; hearing these noises until the trans self-destructs?
&gt; 
&gt; It doesn't seem likely that changing the trans oil, even to a heavier 
&gt; weight, would much improve things.  Anybody have any contrary
&gt; opinions?
&gt; 
&gt; I guess rebuilding these things is beyond the realm of possibilities
&gt; for 
&gt; the home mechanic, so does anybody have a good recommendation for
&gt; trans 
&gt; rebuilders in the SF Bay Area?
&gt;
