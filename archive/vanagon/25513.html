So martino_at_earthlink_dot_net says:
&gt; 
&gt; The correct address is http://www.sky_dot_net/~rmk/hoover
&gt; 
&gt; Very informative, well done.
&gt; 

I've put this site name in the Air-Cooled FAQ along with a short blurb
about the 'Bob' sermons.  Is there an ftp address for those that do not
have Web access??

Thanks,

Steven
