Subject: Pushin' the envelope

	Bay area people: 
	A friend of mine's bass guitar instructor is looking for a 
long-term room or cottage to rent. Joey doesn't drive a VW,  but my 
friend thinks highly of him, and she's picky about people. He's looking 
for a small space in the Palo Alto area, near Gryphon Music where he 
works. Contact me and I'll make the connection.

	Sorry for the non-VW content, but I did the nice-people/nice-people
math and it seemed appropriate.

	Happy Motoring!

	Bill
