welcome to california!!!

and not only that, if you get a lawyer and take action, or if you just 
complain to the Better Business Bureau, like your thinking of, they'll 
have some friends come visit your house, or your friends house as the 
case may be.

be carefull. it sounds sleazy, and it sounds like it's not the first time 
they've done this.

sounds like you have two choices. hire a small army and leave NO liveing 
witnesses when you go to get the car, or pay them off and hope that you 
get back MOST of the important parts of the car.

then sell that thing and get a '68 window van with a 911 engine.

good luck.
