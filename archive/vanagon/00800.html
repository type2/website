Subject: Axle NUTS

I use an eight foot breaker bar on a Sears 3/4 inch breaker bar.  Twists
any nut off like it was made of butter.  I broke Sears 1/2 inch breaker bars,
but never the 3/4 inch variety, while working on air-cooled related problems.

Go at it!!! Twist the F&amp;%*%$(*ker Off!!!!!!!!
