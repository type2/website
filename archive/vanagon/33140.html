So Scott Beckstead says:

&gt; I have to agree.  C-Rats came with a heater also but it was much more 
&gt; fun.  Cut a hole in the box big enough to hold the can of whatever and 
&gt; set the box on fire.  Worked like a charm.  I really like the ham and 
&gt; eggs even if they do look a little green (Dr. Sues not withstanding).
&gt; 

	     I like the enchilada's and the teriyaki too.
	     I even like the chicken if the sauce is not too blue.
