&gt;This would describe mine also.  Which tube is everone talking about?  The

&gt;do we just live with it?

the 'tube' i was talking about was the breather tube ... in that i suspect
it might be crimped or clogged somehow. but i don't have much experience
with 83-85 buses, so it's possible that the filler tube (gas goes down) is
designed too small (and they fixed it in 86?).
