Subject:  '88 leeeky at 60k

my brother's '88 (60k miles) has developed a head gasket leak.  could
someone who has been through it share the proper arbitration
procedure?  (or anyone else, for that matter)  hopefully vw will pay, but
it would be good to know the right things to say/correct  people to
contact.

thanks, matthew (81 adventurewagen)

ps - thanks to listmember ron salmon i think my brother sold the '82 motor
(he's shipping it from los angeles to delaware!), thanks ron.
