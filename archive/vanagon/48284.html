Canadian Tire weekly flyer is showing a van tent attachaed to the rear
hatch of a van.  On sale for $149.99  this week.  Does anyone know
anything about this tent ?  Can it be attached to the side of a Vanagon ? 
Maybe with some modifications ?  I will try to go see one today and
invesigate this myself.  Could be a good deal.

Cheers
