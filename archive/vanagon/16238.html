Subject: Mechanic recommendations?? - Portland,OR

Now that I'm fairly sure that my '84 van needs a head gasket job,
I would like to find a competent mechanic in the Portland, Oregon
area.  Anyone know of shops to avoid or recommend?

Usually I deal with Vintage Motoring.  They are trustworthy 
and reasonable ($38/hour).  However, they were not able to diagnose
my head problem properly, so I suspect that they are a little 
lacking in the head gasket area.

I would like to find a shop that has experience with head
replacements and reconditioning (i.e.  machining).  Also, they
must be current with all the new procedures and Tech Service
Bulletins associated with head gaskets (new torque setting, etc).

Thanks for your help.

Dave
