&gt; 
&gt; After my posting regarding the T4 syncro, I received a couple of 
&gt; requests for info on VolksWorld and VW Motoring. So here's the
&gt; info:
&gt; 
&gt; VolksWorld, available from EWA  - 908 665-7814   $60/yr
&gt; 
&gt; VW Motoring is aparently available direct from the publisher in the UK...

Are these mainly for water-cooled, or do they deal with air-cooled stuff too?
