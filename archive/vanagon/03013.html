Subject:       Re: type 1 engine in t2 (and vacuum assist)

&gt; So, I guess you gave up figuring out what the noise was?

For now I have, until I have the equipment to make a better wave file.  I had a 

VW mechanic listen to it and he said don't worry about it, tht scares me even 
more.  Thanks for the interest.  

&gt; How short is falling short?  there is a rubber strip that also goes up there,
&gt; so that may explain the gap, which on mine is about an 1&quot; - 1/2&quot;

I'm trying to remember but it might be a little more than that.  I'm going to 
the parts place today for the rubber seals and try to install the engine 
tonight or tomorrow and will better be able to tell.  

Another question:  This engine (1641 sp)  has a single weber carb on it with  a 

large intake manifold the old engine (never ran) was from a '68 beetle and 
someone had cut a hole and welded some tubing to the intake manifold to provide 

a place for the vacuum assist brakes.  This weber manifold looks like cast 
aluminum.  Is there a way to get the vacuum from my current setup.  The intake 
maifold  is attached to the heads via the rubber boots as in the dual port 
setup?   Is the vacuum assist really that necessary?  

Also, is that little deal in the vacuum line a filter or something?  this van 
has been sitting in a field for approx 7 years so I definately need a filter if 
the engine is going to be sucking on this hose.  
Thanks,
Mike
