Subject: Squealing AC Compressor
From: jcunning_at_snow.win_dot_net (John H. Cunningham)

        It is HOT now and we are using the air conditioner in my '90
Westpahlia. The compressor squeals when cooling, and stops when
temperature is reached. What is going on? I would expect a bad
bearing to squeal all the time.
        If the compressor is going bad what do I do? Are they
repairable? If a replacement is needed, where can I get oone at a
reasonable price?
