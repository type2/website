&gt; Nothing ruins the peace and quiet of camping more often than generators. 
&gt; Noise that would be acceptable IMO in a city is unacceptable out in the

I have to agree.  Most campgrounds I have been to are extremely quiet.
I can usually hear people drop silverware from 20 sites away.  Even the
quietest generators are a real nuiscance.  I wouldn't mind if they were
outlawed in campgrounds.  Now if something could be done about dogs and
kids... :)  (really, I don't mind a little dog and kid noise...)

&gt; Pete, I noticed that almost everything (except the microwave) that you 
&gt; used with the generator would be adaptable to 12 volts (without an 
&gt; inverter) or propane. A much friendlier alternative.

Agreed.  I remember discussing the inverter issue with Pete, and after 
what he has been through, I don't blame him a bit for being fed up with
them.  Still, I know there are good ones out there.  Personally, I am
considering buying an &quot;Uninterruptable Power Supply&quot; of a few hundred
watts and using it as an inverter.  They are relatively inexpensive, and
must produce decent power if computers can run on them.  Anyone else
considered this??

Finally, cheers to Pete for being conscious of the noise and trying to
minimize it.  Most generator users don't seem to give a damn (but then
most of them drive 40 foot diesel motorhomes with popout living rooms,
not VW's).
