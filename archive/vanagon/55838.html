Subject: Weather report from Ushuaia

&gt;From Jos=E9 Luis Tibaudin &lt;ushuaia54_at_cyberush_dot_com.ar&gt;:
&gt;
&gt;Hi, thanks for asking about Ushuaia.
&gt;
&gt;As you probably know, here, at the southern hemisphere, we have the=
 opposite
&gt;seasons with respect to yours.
&gt;That is why, in July we have winter. At Ushuaia, we have very cold weather
&gt;(-12=BA C to 5=BA C), frequent snow storms, and frozen water surfaces. The=
 day
&gt;lasts very short. Sun rises by 9 a.m. and hides at 2 p.m.
&gt;August is very the same, but with windy days. It's often snowy wind we
&gt;call white wind.
&gt;December (summer) is beautiful. The temperature is higher (7=BA C to 16=BA=
 C)
&gt;and very pleasant. And the day gets its longest duration; it almost doesn't
&gt;hide about dec. 21st. Daylight spans from 4 a.m. to 11:30 p.m.
&gt;January is mostly rainy. It is possible in one day to have sun in the
&gt;morning, wind and rain by afternoon, and sun again by 9 a.m.
&gt;
&gt;Best regards from the southernmost city in the world.
&gt;
&gt;Jos=E9 Luis Tibaudin, Ushuaia below 54=BA South
