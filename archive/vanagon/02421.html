&lt;disgusting discription of 'leering', 'ogling', and 'fondling' deleted&gt;
&gt;...                                But there is
&gt;	one thing I'm not sure of - those black vent
&gt;	thingies in the rear side windows. Are they
&gt;	for improving &quot;flo thru vennelashun&quot;, are they
&gt;	adjustable?

well, having replaced the rubber around my rear side windows, i think i
can safely say that
(1) they are NOT adjustable.
(2) they are nothing but a plastic vent thingie with foam inside.
(3) IF they work at all, it beats me how. i guess the 'theory' is that the
    aerodynamics of the rear edge of a brick will somehow create a suction
    and pull the bad air out of the bus.

    or maybe all the pressure from the air coming in the front of the bus
    will just push the bad air out the back.

what is really funny is that the little black plastic grill vents are STILL
put on the back bottom edge of the front doors ... but the hole behind them
is taped over with duct tape! quicker. cheaper. go figure.
