&gt; &gt; Yes, they do.  We have the GR2s on the front and the Gas-A-Justs on the

&gt; &gt; of our 85 vanagon.  We got them at a FLAPS but I can't remember how much 
&gt; &gt; they
&gt; 
&gt; And, well Jonathon, what do you think? Do they make a positive impression?
&gt; 
&gt; KYB don't make Gas-A-Justs for the front of Vanagons, do they?

They didn't when I was looking about 3 years ago. Rear, yes, front, no. I ended 
up with the GR2s on the front and they are very similar in performance to the 
stock ones IMHO. I'd have to look it up, but I think I paid around $45/ea.
