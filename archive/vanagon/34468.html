 &gt; 
 &gt; The term 'boxer' is used to describe a horizontally-opposed engine having a
 &gt; single crankshaft and camshaft in which the lobes of the camshaft are common
 &gt; to the opposing valves.  
 &gt; 
 &gt; The origin of the term is unclear.
 
The explanation I've heard is that the pistons on a given side move in and out 
alternately, like the fists of a &quot;boxer&quot; pummeling his opponent.
