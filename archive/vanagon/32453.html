&gt;I have on of those blue enameled coffee makers, an old school one

&gt;cup of coffee and I would really like to know why.  If anyone has had 
&gt;good experience with these things could you please e-mail me directly 
&gt;and share the wisdom regarding flame level, time, amount of grounds, 
&gt;etc.?

Actually, percolators are supposed to be carcinogenic, because of the
boiling.  Long-chain hydrocarbons are formed.  Better to use a paper code
drip system.
