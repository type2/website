&gt; it seems that the lady selling it gave this story: her husband had sent her
&gt; a telegram, from Bermuda, where he and his secretary were frolicing. the
&gt; telegram said he wanted a divorce, and she (wife; seller of Mercedes) should
&gt; keep the house, and sell the car and send him half. so she did.

Ya know I heard this story  also but it was a Porche in Oregon, the guy 
was in Mexico with his secretary and the price was $10.00.
Just &quot;Another Urban Legend&quot; I guess!
