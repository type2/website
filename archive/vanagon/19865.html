Hi Steven,

I don't know what's in it exactly but it's a brownish color and kind of
thick. I have had no decrease in my heaters as a result of using this
stuff nor have any other bad consequenses been experienced. I put it in
at ~70k and I now have 128k. Leaks were noticed at the head gaskets and
shortly after that is when I started using it. Since I put it in about
four years ago I only had to add another dose after I flushed the
cooling system. Before I used it I had to replace two water pumps.
Since the use of BarsLeak I have not had to replace one.

Steve,

What is the material in the BarsLeak?  I presume it is doing some kind
of coating.  My concerns I'd have is that it could coat the radiator
in such a way that the radiator couldn't do it's job as well.  The other
concern would be that it would coat the sensors such that they could not do
their jobs either.  Clogging is a concern too.  How many miles have you
driven after you've added this stuff?  And did you start using it before
or after you started having leaks?  And where were the leaks.

Hope that's not too many questions.  :)
