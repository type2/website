Subject:       Rebuild Help (1600 t2)

I'm building an engine over the weekend, and unfortunately, have to 
nickle and dime the job a bit.  I don't want to but want and need are 
two different worlds.  I've never built an engine with used 
parts before, and have a few questions if anyone has some time.   
Basicaly what I need to know is:

A)  Will any dual pressure relief case take a double thrust cam 
bearing, or does it need to be specially cut for that?

B)  What is the advisability of running what looks to be a good used 
(unground) cam?  I don't want to, but I'm not sure if want has a whole lot to do 
with what I'm working with here.  It's my only car, and my wife and I 
can't really afford to spring for a new cam unless absolutely 
neccesary.

C)  Can I run that good used cam with my good used lifters?

D)  I picked up a VDO oil temp. gauge at the wrecking yard last week. 
The output is in Celsius, but the only senders I can find are listed 
for gauges that read in degrees Farenheit.  Anyone know if such an 
animal will work?  To my way of thinking, it should, but I'd like to 
be sure.

E)  Along the VDO lines, has anyone ever installed a sender in the 
sump plate?  I know dipstick senders are available, but I don't want 
one unless the sump plate sender is notoriously bad news.  

Thanks in advance for all your help.   This is kind of a bad deal for 
me.  I've been running a beetle short block that I picked up used 
this summer, figuring that the bottom end would be good enough to get
me through this winter, and I could build my other block (I bought 
the car with a bad motor last december, and had all the macine work 
done on it in the spring, so at least I wasn't totaly caught with my 
pants down) at my leisure, 
getting it ready for eventual installation next summer.  Sucks to be 
me.  

For all you temp. controll fiends out there...I'm hooking up the 
thermostat on this one.  Probably a good thing, as I've taken to 
liking that t3 &quot;supercool&quot; tin on my cylinders after living in St 
Louis for the past few summers.  Now that I'm in the cold, cold west, 
however, keeping that system closed and warm to get it to operating 
temp sooner seems like a pretty good idea. 


Thanks again.
