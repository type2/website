Subject: next CCC's campout!


The next CCC's campout is potentially scheduled for the first weekend
in August.  If you can make it, let me know.  If we get enough response,
the trip is on, basically.  The location is basically yet to be
determined, and we're open for suggestions.

Please let me know ASAP if/when/where, etc.  Thanks..

 Current lust list: a TDI Passat wagon, DC/12v coffee-grinder &amp; blender,
  black currant juice, a moped, hot showers and a faucet top for my '81 westy,
   and last but not least:  a pair of those old-fashioned metal roller-skates,
    made, I think, by Winchester (but any would do) - the kind which fasten
     on to the outside of your shoes, and are length- and width-adjustable
      with a metal key.  They have leather straps for the ankle.  They were
       very popular in the 60's.  Thanks!  /m
