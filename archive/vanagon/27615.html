Subject: Re[2]: Junkyard Dogs (Transplant)

     Hmmm, my waking thoughts this morn were what you do to an
     oilpan when you tilt an engine....fabricate an new pan?
     Dry sump conversion sounds complex, where do we find experience
     in this area? Is it something racing types still do?
     Maybe we could post an inquiry to rec.auto.machinists ;-).
     I think the oil tank installation is the one place you have to cut
     metal with the MSDS conversion.

     These Jetta/Golf engine swaps may be fine for diesels, but
     Syncros already have more displacement, more torque, and more hp than
     the J/G engines! Hot rodding one is, however, where they reach the
     power we need.

     Also, I see in the mags that they hot rod the digifant systems. Wonder
     if you did that to a wasserboxer, ported and polished, and followed
     Bob Hoover'ssermons on more HP, just what you would get. Something to
     experiment with, I suppose, when the first transplant occurs and we
     have a spare 2.1 wasserboxer to play with.

     Later,

     Tom F.

great idea, thanks, no VAG 6cyls here.  The 23.25&quot; of VAG 5cyl Audis is same
as one engine KEP listed, for Toyota 2TC, a transplant they rec. due to
smoothness of the engine. So... 5cyls do fit lengthwise. Won't have to
shorten the Syncro drive shaft and move up the trans!  Rabbit engine is
listed at 22&quot;,  I suspect due to fuel distributor, which a guy in BC ,
Malahat Junkers who do swaps, told me when I called. A guy at 4 Ever 4 in NH
sticks with &lt;100HP Jettas due to not wanting to wire-up the knock sensor.  I
haven't called him yet.  Oh,  that '86 Quattro turbo was aircooled turbo,
so I can wait. and.. the guy in BC figured a Syncro conversion was
impossible, hah, what does he know. Gulp. Any thoughts on getting the oil
pan out of there? (off the skidplates!) Run a dry sump kit like a Porsche?
bye,  tim
