Subject: '85 1.9L Oil pump removal

Hi Volks,
	My friend is trying to remove the oil pump from his 85 westy, 
and can't do it.  I myself am ignorant of all things watercooled.  He 
says he needs to keep the flyweel from turning while he is removing the 
pump.  He thinks he may need a special tool since the camper is an 
automatic.  I really have no advice for him.  Is there a protocol for 
this somewhere?  Can anybody help.  I'd appreciate it.  He's a pretty 
good mechanic, unlike myself, so any advice dosen't need to be 
translated into Idiot(stuff i'd understand) level.


TIA
