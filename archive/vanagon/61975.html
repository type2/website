Stephen and Listees,

Can you or anyone else out there tell us more about the Oettinger
high-performance chips for waterboxers, and the 2.5L conversion?  How
can we contact them, who sells their stuff, what experience have people
had with their products?  Thanks

&gt; I have some aquaintainces who have one in a beautifully re-built
&gt; '88 Crew Cab here in Australia.It is used for towing a large boat.
&gt; Fits neatly in the engine bay and is very impressive in terms of it's
&gt; power and low down torque.
&gt; 
&gt; They were lucky,got it from a Camper at an auto wreckers who didn't
&gt; realize the value of these things (sounds like an urban myth but I
&gt; kid you not!)Not sure how it came to be there however.
&gt; These guys have a VW restoration/repair business and are also one of the
&gt; local agents for all the Oettinger stuff like high performance chips for
&gt; WBXs,T4s,Golfs and Polos.They have also done the training for this
&gt; technology in the Fatherland so they know their trade.
&gt; 
&gt; All Oettinger gear is good quality but very expensive.According to them,
&gt; an Oettinger 6cyl WBX costs about DM45,000 ...Gott im Himmel!!!
&gt; Go do a conversion into $US then scrape out your trousers.
&gt; 
&gt; Oettinger also do a 2.5 litre conversion for 2.1l WBXs which is very good
&gt; but that aint cheap either.I think it's about $8,000 Aus,but they're out
&gt; there as I see them sometimes.Wish I had that sort of money....
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
