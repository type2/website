Subject: Re: OEM Style Safari Latch bases

Been there, done that already.  Here at Bus Boys, we repro'd the latch bases
over a year ago and sell 'em for $22 ea.  Base and post are two separate
pieces, both solid stee (not steal), welded and chromed and they look just
like the originals.  Left Side PN 211-847-513, Right Side PN 211-847-514.
 Note - the post is not chromed to allow better turning action for the latch.
 Too stiff if chromed.  Also too much money to have casted in one solid piece
(price would have been about $65 to $75 each - a little steep.  Just sent
several hundred to the chrome shop this week for plating and will have 'em at
the VW Classic/SOTO.  Complete repro latches are $39.95 ea.

Have a Happy :)
