=====================================================================
Peter asked about supporting transaxle while pulling engine in a 73.
My son and I just pulled the engine in his 78 with 2 liter type 4.  The 
transaxle was supported at the front and rear by its own mounts and did not 
require any further support.  I had to look close because the Hayne manual 
also said to support the transaxle.
After struggling to slide the engine back far enough to clear the transaxle 
the first time we removed the engine, I found that it is easier (IMHO) to 
remove the transaxle and engine  as one unit and then seperate them on the 
garage floor.  When done this way, with the bus raised sufficently high 
enough, the whole thing just drops straight down.
