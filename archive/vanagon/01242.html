Subject: Sound Proofing '69 bus


	The other day I took off the door panel on my van to fix the 
window that would no longer roll up and got the idea to sound proof my 
bus.  There is nothing in the door to block road noise except the door 
panel itself.  I went down to the local foam shop and picked out some 
1/2&quot; black dense rubbery foam.  It costs about $1 per square foot.    
I am thinking of removing all of my interior panels and installing this foam.
The foam store sells a foam adhesive in a spray can that I plan to use to
stick the foam directly to the bare painted metal.

	Has anyone done anything like this to eliminate road and engine 
noise in their van or bug?  How well does it work?  I've heard that 3M 
spray adhesive is a lot better than the no name brands for this type of 
application.  Any experience with these adhesives?

	Hopefully, the expense and work will pay off in a 
more enjoyable quieter ride and preserve my hearing as well.

John
