Subject: Hydr. lifters revisited '81

Well I thought everything was fine, since it sounded like the lifters 
pumped up and the motor ran fine,  but now I have a problem.
I was heading for the mountains and right near the top of the Saluda 
Grade I started loosing power. I pulled over and had to open the deck 
to hear the motor over the traffic and it sounded horrible. A 
metallic rattle and thump. AAA towed me to an exit and I poped the 
valve covers, The #3 rocker arm had come loose and looks like the 
lifter had leaked out. I put the nut back on but it is still making 
the noise, and no power. 
I was able to borrow a tow dolly and got it home today.
Any ideas what to check first?
Anybody got a complete motor for sale? (not Gerry's Diesel! 8^} )
