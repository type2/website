Subject: Re: CV joints how much

I have an 82 Vanagon and the rear driver side CV joints just started to 
click. I was told that I need to get them replaced. Do I need both 
replaced or how do I tell which is bad? And how much should I expext to 
pay? Should I get them both replaced while they are out?
