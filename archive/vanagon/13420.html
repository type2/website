Subject: Re: Oil Leak Problem II  help!!!

I like and totally agree with David's description of this operation. I've got 
one thing to add, though, and I've mentioned this before on this topic. Ask for 
pushrod tube seals made of Viton. Space age material, kids. They stay pliable, 
and your oil stays in the engine and off the driveway. They're about twice the 
price, but these o-rings are cheap anyway.

Sold at better VW shops everywhere... can you tell I'm a big fan?

&gt; Nope, don't even have to remove the heads.  It is easily done in a couple
&gt; of hours.  Buy new seals (16 of them), remove the valve covers, remove
&gt; the rocker arm assemblies, and pop the tubes out through the holes in
&gt; the heads.  DON'T use any tools on the tubes - first try using rags.  Rags
&gt; should give you enough grip to pull them out, but if not, go ahead and
&gt; use the vise-grips on them, but buy and install new tubes also in that
&gt; case.  If you squeeze the tubes, they will probably leak from then on.
&gt; Clean everything real well, put the new seals on the tubes, and pop them
&gt; in.  Re-install the rocker arm assemblies and adjust the valves.  Top it
&gt; off with a new set of valve cover gaskets (cause they are just pennies each)
&gt; and you're done!  Oh, don't forget to install those little wire retainers -
&gt; make sure they are butting up hard against the lip of each pushrod tube.
&gt; And the concensus seems to be NOT to use any of that permatex silicon sealer
&gt; on the seals - they need to move around because of the thermal expansion
&gt; of the engine.
