Subject: heater blower motor

When I bought my 79, the blower motor wasn't working.  I suffered through
the cold.  A few days ago I was poking around and found that the 16 amp 
fuse had blown.  Replaced it and started it up: GREAT.  Than 10 secs 
later it had a high pitch wine, and then quit:  it had blown the replaced 
fuse.  So I put in another fuse.  Runs for about a minute, then blows the 
fuse.   Any ideas on this?
