Thanx to all,

Well my first couple of days on this list have astonished me. As soon 
as I saw there was such a thing as a Vanagon mailing list I had this 
feeling that help was on its way. Only being on for less than two 
days Ive got people giving me input out my ears. This is going to be 
a long, what the hell is wrong with this thing, weekend. But with all 
the suggestions Ive gotten its going to be a hell of alot easier. 
Again thanx and to all you CCC's enjoy, wish I could go (boo hoo).

ps. Messed up on list, looking '73 popup, not '72. Sorry, no big 
difference though.
