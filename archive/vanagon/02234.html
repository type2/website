Subject: Re: Gasoline difference

Let's assume that most of our engines have low-moderate compression (The GEX 
engine I installed had this purposely done so as to be compatible with 87 
Octane gas). This means that with FI 
there should be no knock or ping with low grade (read 87 Octane) gas. I 
have heard it said by some manufacturers ie SAAB that with their engines 
and electronic ignition advance systems, 87 Octane will provide the same 
performance as 92. Is this also true for Vanagons (and all other 
systems with FI)? In other words, if an engine doesn't knock or ping with 
87 Octane, then why go to a higher grade?

Wouldn't the answer be that the higher grade provides more power but only   
if in the event we 
wanted to advance the ignition past the point of normal ie 6 degrees atdc?

just curious - DC

&gt; Well, for my bus I was using 92 octane because it would diesel and back 
&gt; fire on the cheaper gas.  I tried adjusting everything, but it never 
&gt; worked.  But high octane fixed it.  I also noticed that I got about 2 MPG 
&gt; more, but that coul be contributed to me feathering the gas to prevent 
&gt; backfires from cheap gas.
