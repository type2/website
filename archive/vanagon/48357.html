Subject: Trade my '74 Bus for your (diesel/gas) Vanagon +/- cash?


(Sent to type2 and vanagon lists)

Subject line is pretty self-explanatory.  I currently have a '74 Bus 
(pancake 1800, stick, seats 7), but the vast majority of my VW experience 
has been with wasserboxers, and most of that has been with diesels.  When 
it comes right down to it, I feel more comfortable working on them.  


Here are some more detailed stats on my bus:

- '74 Bus.  1800cc engine.  Seats for 7.  Missing 2 seatbelts.
- Body is in good condition overall.  Needs some minor rust work in 
	right rear and d/s floor (currently patched with my old
	license plate.)  Has had other rust repair, which was
	fairly well done.  Entire van is undercoated.
- New front brake pads and shocks all around (2000 miles ago)
- Will include both english and metric speedometer/odometer
- Needs:
	- work on brake cylinder or proportioning valve
	- rust work (see above)
	- muffler and heater boxes or j-tubes
	- a better stereo :)
	- backup lights don't work (might be simple; I'll check)
	- a tuneup

Note that the emissions system is far from stock (some might even say 
&quot;far from being installed&quot;).  This will pose a problem in areas with 
strict emissions tests.  

I'm willing to travel in the northeast (NY, New England, PA, NJ, OH, 
maybe MI, parts of Ontario, maybe southwest Quebec, maybe a bit 
farther).  We can discuss terms.  My only two solid requirements are a 
good body and a solid engine...cosmetics and things I can fix aren't a 
problem.  I would strongly prefer a diesel, but will consider a gas if 
the price is right.  Year doesn't matter.  Mileage doesn't matter too 
much (prefer under 200k, but will consider a diesel with more).

If you're interested in such a trade, let me know and we'll talk...

	- Tom
