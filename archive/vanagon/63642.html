Subject: 5:30PM Friday...The 1.9 L TD lives...
Date: Fri, 8 Aug 1997 18:05:55 -0700

To All who,ve been following my conversion progress,
This afternoon, my `82 diesel Westy came alive with the throb of a 1.9 L
Turbo Diesel... Sans air cleaner, the turbo wistle was music to my ears.
Also, with a short stub of a tailpipe and no muffler, it made little noise
as the turbo absorbes a bunch. Starting monday, the niggleing problems will
be addressed (lower the engine mounts about an inch, realign the throttle,
install an air cleaner, who knows, maybe even a longer tailpipe
