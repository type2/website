&gt;        I discovered a small leak by the rear heater in my '85
&gt;and dutifully called up and read about the &quot;new&quot; metal plug
&gt;that was supposed to cure this very problem.  However, when
&gt;I went to my Friendly Local VW Dealer and talked to my friend
&gt;in the parts department (he realy is friendly, and intelligent
&gt;too. I have been going back there for over 15 years.  I DO shop
&gt;for prices, but sometimes you can only get certain things from
&gt;the dealer.)  The part number I gave him is dead, no good, etc.
&gt;The number I used is N 902 061 01.  Does any one know what the
&gt;CORRECT part number is?

according to the last fiche i have (for 1985 buses) from 1993, the part
number is on Frame 36-40 of the fiche, and is  861-819-039 ... that's the
bleeder screw. the sealing washer (under it) is 897-819-037.

get him to check it out and let us know if these new numbers are right (so
we can change the Tech stuff on the gopher).
