Subject: Re: Only 2,138 16&quot; Syncros Were Made--letter from Germany

With Derek's new figures, it would seem that the Westfalia conversion numbers
were hidden in the Caravelle/Bus figures, as the panels and kombis would
be in the &quot;Van&quot; figures, and there must have been more campers made that
that.

This all agrees with what I've heard -- single-cab trucks are quite rare
(actually they are not common in non-syncro dress, either).  Panels are
less rare but not common.  I still have not found out about a single other
example of a syncro kombi besides mine, but would assume that probably
a thousand out of the quoted 5,848 would sound about right.  And doublecabs
are the most common transporter.

It is also interesting that the &quot;Van&quot; is quoted with three seats, but the DC
with only 5.  I have not seen any bench-seat panels or kombis, although
they certainly were offered, but about half the DC's I've seen had the
front bench, and seat six.  The few single-cab's I've seen all had the
bench seat (a 1/3 2/3 seat arrangement).

Good stuff Derek!

Do these figure also include the type 2's and pre-86 type 3's that SDP
alledgedly made as military conversions?  Are most of the 16&quot; packages
military also?  I was told that rear disc's were available as an option with
the 16&quot; package.  Any truth?
