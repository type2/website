Subject: ac water got no exit!

hi all..
   so after much procrastination...i finally delt with my ac....(87 westy).
 replaced reciever drier,,,ballast resistor for low speed fan...and had it
recharged..at the dealer!  because they were the best price!!!!and they could
diagnose if all wasnt well.  the good news is the system appears
tight.._dot_compressor seems to work ok...(is it normal to be able to hear the
compressor?  not a unpleasant sound...just new to me...;)  ) ,,,cool air
cometh,,,my only concern(other than total failure anytime),,is the condensate
draining out of the body seams below the air intakes.   where is this water
supposed to go?  as i look at the drain tubes...they seem to be sealed at the
ends!   no provision for draining the water away from the car.
 instead....dont know where its leaking out..but its landing in the body
cavity and finding its way out any way it can.  ie. body seams that have been
rusting from years of this condition.  on the other side of the car...the
water has rusted a hole right in the middle of the floor of the body
cavity...i guess this is bettter than thru seams..but what the heck!  whats
the deal?  what am i missing?  anyone know of this problem?  any thoughts?
 any at all....;)
