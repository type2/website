VV&gt;&gt; Bobo? That's very cute. Kind of reminds me of Montgomery Burn's 
VV&gt;teddy bear &gt; in one of the Simpsons' episode. So, where did you find 
VV&gt;those seats? Were &gt; they expensive. I looked at some catalogs, but 
VV&gt;they were expensive, like &gt; $250 each. Maybe I'll try to find myself 
VV&gt;those heated Volvo seats someone &gt; else had mentioned a few weeks 
VV&gt;ago. (Saab probably has them too, and IF I &gt; remember well, the 
VV&gt;recline is thiner than average and so the seat would fit &gt; more 
VV&gt;easily.) &gt; 
   
I am interested in any seat that installs directly into an 84 Vanagon and
swivels without any mods. The camper swivel is welded in and is a real
pain to remove so it is a almost last resort. Any info on any seat that is
a direct replacement with no swivel is good as well as my seat are in good
condition but none too comfortable.  If anyone has the swivel from a
camper in a trashed camper available also please let me know. 
    I think I covered all those bases.
