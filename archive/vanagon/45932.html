Re Bill Crick's FI stalling problem:
I have a flow chart from VW on troubleshooting the AFC FI (actually for
type I, but same parts)- under ENGINE STARTS-STALLS AFTER SHORT TIME, they
do mention your problem at the end (hose off on way from intake air
distr.), after first going thru possible faults in Aux. air reg. (should be
open when cold),, double relay, pump contact in intake air sensor (must
close to keep pump running), cyl head temp sensor, (resistance too high),
bad EGR valve (either leaks or doesn't let contacts operate), or bad
throttle valve switch  Any problems I've had in my 78 Wresty (170K mi now)
have always related to an air leak somewhere, and is what I would check
first.   Mike Benthin in NJ
