Another VW sighting.  On a recent rerun of Nash Bridges, the one 
where they are searching for a Pinto belonging to baseball player, 
the get into the wrecking yard holding the Pinto by climbing over the 
fence aided by a splitty used as a ladder.

&gt;&gt;I saw a (Dove?-) Blue Vanagon with round head lights in the movie &quot;White&quot; 
(predecessor to &quot;Red&quot;).  It was outside a Paris courthouse in a scene early on 
in the movie.  I had to look it over with the frame-to-frame feature on the VCR 
because the camera panned by so fast.  Got a good look at it this way and if 
memory serves right it was an 88 with the large, round VW emblem on the back 
hatch and power mirrors.  I assume that Euro - Vanagons have some of the same 
distinguishing features as the North American Vanagons even though the head 
lights were round.

88 Dove?-Blue GL with four rectangular headlights and a large, round VW emblem 
on back
