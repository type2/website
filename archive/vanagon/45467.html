The bus, as Clara predicted, is really Sealing Wax Red.

happy happy, joy joy

The 36hp is siezed.  This is my first experience with a 36hp.  Wow, 
what a crazy looking engine!  All small with the generator stand part 
of the case, and a little teeny intake manifold!  

And for those of you that have made it this far, here's the chassis 
number:

416848.  It was on the little plate, and stamped into the 
tranny tunnel.  Clara good friend, does your magic book shed some 
light?  Thanks!- - 

your bus is a very early 59,  buildt 1 Jan 59 !   pretty neat.

would have come w/ split case trans, 36hp motor, and the crank start stuff.
 This meanswhen you put your later engine in,  the heater boxes will hang up,
and it'll be a juggling manuever to get it lined up

hope  get it going soon :)   i like 59s
