Subject: Help me find a RUST-FREE split camper

Howdy all.
 In addition to looking into stickers over the vacation, I had to (with
LOTS of help) do some pretty creative welding on my trusty '67 to repair
some rust problems with the gear shift lever. Although my bus runs well,
and has the best personality and &quot;car-ma&quot; possible, her early life in
New Jersey has taken its toll. Of course the floors and rockers are
gone, but the frame has some pretty bad damage, and very recently I
noticed that the driver's seat will soon be resting on the tire. The
falling aparft of the whole shift-lever-bracket-brace-assembly has shown
me that no matter how much I love my bus, at some point I must find
another. As this is a painful process, (I am far too sentimental), I
want to find one of those glorious treasures- a bus with NO Rust, so I
can use it until I have children, and let them enjoy it.
These are pretty much the qualities I want:
 '57-'67 camper (Westfalia or Dormobile)
 Pop-top (or submarine hatch, according to year)
 NO RUST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (some surface rust is ok, like on the
roof, but the floors/rockers/etc must be rock solid
 Some dents/dings are ok. I want to use this bus, not put it in a
museum, so scratches and such are ok.
 12 Volt would be nice
 Good transaxle would be nice
 
  Basically I want a good camper that I can use everyday. Because of such
use, a later (as in '64-'67) might be better, because if I had an older
one, I would be kind of scared to use it. I plan to love it and take
good care of it, but I don't want one too perfect to drive. Mechanical
condition is not as important, since I'll be fixing it up myself. 
  Price - I can't really afford a multi-thousand dollar bus. I would
probably rather find one to fix up, just because it would cost less.
Also, I can pay more for a bus that I have to travel less to get. (I'm
in NC)
  Anyway, I just want a good, solid bus to drive. I would never chop it,
mutilate it, or do anything to disgrace it.
So, if anyone can help me out, I would really appreciate it, and if I do
end up making stickers, I'll send you some.
Many thanks,
Richard
