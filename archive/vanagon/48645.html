Subject: Another lifter Ques

Hi All,

I would like to pick the V_at_L brain again. I have another lifter question that I
was wondering what others might think. I have an 83 wasserwesty that sat for a
while before I got it. It had some work done on it before I got it and they
said they changed the oil. I was going to change the oil again to be sure but
noticed that the drain plug looked like a beaver worked it over. I tried once
to get it out and said the hell with it I'll do it when I change the oil after
3,000 miles. Needlesss to say it took an easy out &lt;&lt;&lt;cringe&gt;&gt;&gt; and a new drain
plug but I changed the oil. Oh yeah, back to the lifters. I started to get a
loud clack, clack in the morning. I know this is normal. But, the valve train
is especially noisy. I had a compression test done a while ago and one cylinder
was alittle lower than the rest. I know that worn lifters can cause lower
compression.  When I drive the valve system gets alittle quieter but still
seems to make noise (more from the head with low compression) Also when I drive
to work it feels alittle sluggish. If I shut it off and then drive it again it
feels like it has more power. When I leave work it feels like it is sluggish. I
think that the lifters are worn and that they are not compressing/expanding as
they should. When they are cold they are collapsed and the valves are
clattering and compression is lower. When they are charged there is less noise
and it seems to have more power. Should I replace them? Does this seem
reasonable or am I totally off base? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks again.

dave
