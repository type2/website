&gt;It would involve calling the college to find out who is responsible for 
&gt;the network and then finding out if they know they are unaccessable to 
&gt;the outside world. 
&gt;Of course, if someone knows this to be wrong ( and MY system is hosed for 
&gt;some reason ) that would be even better.

Well, judging by your e-mail address, you might want to talk to the Great
List Overseer, Originator, and Moderator.
