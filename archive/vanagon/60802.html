Subject: Break job

I have been experiencing low pedal pressure, and decided to adjust the rear
drums and then bleed them.  The rears bled well enought--black fluid
suggested they needed it, but when I moved to the front, the bleeders were
rusted stuck.  I broke one off trying to free it, and was surprised to not
have the fluid run out.
Now what do I do?  Is there a procedure for replacing a broken bleeder
screw?  Is is safe to drive as is?
Unfortunately, the low pedal pressure remains...
TIA for any sage advice,
Jim
