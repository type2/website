 All this talk about overheating has piqued my curiostity &lt;again&gt;. Could
 someone who has both a cylinder head temp and an oil temp gauge comment on 
 the relationship between the two. When the engine gets hot, do both temps
 move up together? Is oil temperature more affected by engine speed &lt;increased
 friction&gt; than head temp? Do the heads ever get really hot but the oil stays
 closer to normal?

 And finally, what temperature do people call &quot;overheating&quot;? Oil temp at 250
 degrees? Heads at 400 degrees? 

 A curious mind wants to know.
