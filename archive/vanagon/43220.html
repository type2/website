Subject: Fuel Injection emergency question

I'm really sorry to all because this is about my Type III but I really
need it to run until I get the '66 Westy on the road.  My problem is that
it has started to run like total crap.  It sounds like it's going to
explode so I'm scared to drive it.  It is a '73 with the stock FI.  I have
recently changed the oil, spark plugs, cap, adjusted points and timing and
valves are all fine.  What I discovered tonight though is that the
headlights and dash lights dimmed noticeably at one point and the car ran
worse.  The leads me to believe that there may be a short circuit
somewhere causing everything to go wonky.  Does anyone agree with this?
Any other ideas.  I don't really know how to diagnose the FI so I could
use some help.  Could it be a vacuum leak?  If it is a short, what is the
best way to locate it?  Ack, please help, I can only bum rides for so
long.
Thanks in advance,
-Erik
