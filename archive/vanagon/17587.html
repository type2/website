HI ALL...

&gt; off, the bus will stop if you stand up on the brake pedal.

Hey Mark,  The brake system isn't THAT complicated...it just has a brake
assist attached to the master cylinder.  You must have the vacuum tubes
from the manifold attached or the brakes won't work worth a flip.  BUT, if
you attach the vacuum line to the assist the brakes work like a dream.
I changed manifolds on my first (bus) rebuild and put on a bug manifold which
only has a place for a small vacuum tube.  I had to re-do it and put on	  
the correct manifold with the correct (1/2&quot;) tube on it.  This is a little
hard to find...I don't know if you can even order it.  Could probably 	  
fabricate one using bug manifold.  A small drawback of the '71 disk brakes is
that the pads wear kinda fast.  GOPHERIT!
  
ANYWHO, this one is a lot more do-able than your other idea.  I know that
that sandy, salty island environment is gonna be hard on your bus.  Those
exposed ball joints will be victims soon enough, so you might just live 
with them until you can tell they're worn, then have someone with the 	
proper tools do the dirty work while you watch and take notes.  I have 
never had to do this on my bus, and from what I've heard it can be a bitch.
You need some kind of press to get them out, etc.   I do think you  			
should have them all done at once tho.  I'll let someone else comment
on that since I've avioded it. (knock knock)

&gt; 2) All of the rubber boots protecting the ball joints have rotted away.  
&gt; Would it be easier to change them individually or replace the whole 
&gt; suspension system as a unit.  I've never worked with suspensions, but am 
&gt; willing to if it's doable.
