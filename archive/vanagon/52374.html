&gt;    My wife &amp; I met a couple with a Westy who didn't realize that the stainless
&gt; steel heat shield behind the 2-burner range is hinged and can be dropped so it
&gt; can be utilized as a countertop for draining washed dishes.

This feature is not included in models shipped to Canada (doesn't meet
CSA Motor Home Specs). I'm planning on picking up (or making) this
feature for my Westy.

&gt;    BTW, here's an unintended &quot;feature&quot; we discovered.  The rear seat can be
&gt; clicked into  position facing backwards, forming a nice chaise which we find
&gt; comfortable for reading before bedtime.

How exactly do you accomplish this wonderful trick?
