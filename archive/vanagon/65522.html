Subject:      Re: Stainless Exhaust Update

The value of a stainless exhaust probably depends on where you live. Here in
Texas I finally replaced the muffler on my '87 after 10 years, and the rest of
the exhaust is still original (160k). My '91 (100k+) is also still original.
With life of plain steel that long stainless doesn't mean much.
