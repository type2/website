Subject: VW Sighting  TV AD

During ER tonight the Maxwell House Ad in a quick flash showed  2 or 3 people pushing a squareback 
in a snowfall, now it was a quick shot and from the side, but the louvers were there and so was the 
shape. 

On thing wrong with the ad is that we all know that Squarebacks do not get stuck in the snow, I 
know I drive one between PA and Vermont twice a month.


Who cares.... Right Ric!
