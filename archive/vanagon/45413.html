&gt; thanks for confirming this
&gt; 

But earlier she wrote:

&gt; 0 301 353 - ~ early sept 63
&gt;
&gt; 0 590 821 - ~ early june 64
&gt;

and concluded that the number referenced in my '64 Deluxe's warranty book 
(0 301 353) was in fact the correct and original number.

Now I'm confused.  Jim's reference listed the starting number for '64 
model (Aug. '63) 1500s as 0 578 878 (which puts my current motor number 0 
590 821 pretty darn close to Sept. '63  (the VIN plate date of 
manufacture for VIN 1165853).

These references don't seem to jive.  Was Jim's off by a year?

&gt; 
&gt; but my  (VW published for dealer use) books have slightly different numbers
&gt; than yours for the body changes (engine numbers are the same).  Curiouser and
&gt; curiouser, said Alice.
&gt; 
 
And curiouser still ...


Thanks again for trying to set me straight.  :-)
