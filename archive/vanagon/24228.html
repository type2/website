You mean the panel van, single and double cab pickup, in 2WD and Syncro 
versions, I assume. These are the work vehicles, and weren't popular due to 
outrageous price in comparison to Amer/Jap. versions. eg my '85 panel cost 
$16,500Cdn new, (add $4,000Cdn if Syncro version). For a tin box with 2 
front seats and a front rubber floor mat. Good luck finding one. If you 
really must have a panel, I can ask the guy I sold my '85 to if he'll sell 
it to you! Just put a new 2.1l in and you won't know the difference from an 
'87 on.  tim s.
