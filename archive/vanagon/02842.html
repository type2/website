Subject:      problem &amp; comment...

first the comment:

Oh Martha.... I can't believe your list has grits being a redneck
prerequisite.
  You have drawn first blood! It just isn't really breakfast w/o grits. And it
just isn't Thanksgiving w/o Cheese Grits. Ah... so little they understand over
on the left coast ;-)

Now, for vanagon stuff:

I too need to replace the antenna. I also want a tape deck. Can anyone
recommend a decent deck (w/ am &amp; fm) and speaker upgrades that will allow a
few more improvements w/o breaking the bank before the upcoming Buses By The
Arch? I also would like decent sound and enough bass to have a full bodied
sound (NOT the low rumble heard so frequently from cars now). I would prefer
to take stuff out and place the new components right in the old holes. Jeez--I
don't want much do I?


On another note:

We too, carry blankets. They're already spread out bed-style in the poptop. It
is much nicer than sleeping bags and easier to add or remove layers.
