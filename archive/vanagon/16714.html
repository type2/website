Subject: Help Me Find a Bus and Get $200.00
Date: 1 May 1995 12:37:28 -0400

I know this sound desperate, but I am looking for a 23 window, preferably,
or a 21 window VW rag top bus.

I live in the San Jose, San Francisco area, and WILL PAY $200.00 to the
person who helps me find a bus I like in the area.

It has to be in fairly good condition, no rust (or maybe just a little is
okay) some restoration is okay.

Thanks in advance.
