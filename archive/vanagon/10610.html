&gt;the yards to protect the environment.  I always recycle it if it is
&gt;anything more than what gets spilled on the floor in the garage.

Recycle it where???  around here in the Midwest there are no places of that
I know that recycle the sh*t.  The community recycling center only does Oil,
and states in large letters NO ANTIFREEZE.  The only thing I have heard
around here is &quot;just dump it down the drain, the sewage treatment plant can
handle it in small amounts.&quot;.

Just wonderin'
