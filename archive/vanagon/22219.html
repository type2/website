Subject: Mailer test - discard -do not read

     Our mailer system assigns every incoming message an
     alias and eliminates the originators mail address (nice idea
     right?) I am trying to find out if I can use the alias
     works for posting to the vanagon list. The sysop here was
     no help in answering my questions.

     Sorry to take up the bandwidth.. wait, you were not
     supposed to read this! ;-)
