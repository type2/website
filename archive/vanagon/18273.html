Subject: directions to Bodega Bay


There are 4 exits one can take to get from Highway 101 to get to the
Bodega Bay area:

1.  Take River Rd.  Exit. Follow west to Guerneville, then take hwy. 116
    to hwy. 1 south to Bodega Bay - 36 miles.

2.  Take hwy. 12 west exit through Sebastopol until it becomes
    Bodega hwy to coast hwy. 1 - 23 miles.

3.  Take hwy. 116 west exit to Sebastopol, then west on hwy. 12 (which
    is also called the Bodega hwy.) to coast hwy 1 - 28 miles.

4.  Take the East Washington St. exit, and follow the signs
    30 miles west to Bodega Bay.  

If anyone wants to call the Bodega Bay Area Visitors Center, their
number is:  1.707.875.3422

We are staying at the Bodega Dunes State Campground, which is one-half
mile north of the town of Bodega Bay.  

PLEASE NOTE:  The town on the ocean (on hwy. 1) is called Bodega Bay.
There is also a town of Bodega, about 5-10 minutes inland from Bodega
Bay.  For those of you who remember the schoolhouse in the Hitchcock
movie, that structure appeared in the film as being in Bodega Bay,
but is in reality in Bodega instead, and apparently still stands.  I
doubt, however, that Suzanne Pleshette still teaches there :)
