Subject: RE: Heater motor gone?


&gt;Aunt Augusta, our 1987 Syncros, is making a horrible screeching
&gt;noise when the heat is turned on.
&gt;
&gt;I don't know all the details, but the husband wanted to know
&gt;a) is it possible it is NOT the heater motor itself and b) do you
&gt;REALLY have to remove the dashboard to get at the heater motor?
&gt;
&gt;He's got a large, green manual for her so he's done the research,
&gt;but wanted to consult with the pros.  :-)
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any info,
&gt;Kim


Please see the vanagon_at_lenti archives re: cats in the heater tubes.
