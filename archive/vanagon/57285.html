Subject: Litchfield VW Toy and Literature Show

My Buddy and I arrived at the Litchfield Inn about 9:45 to see just a
few dozen cars in the parking lot.  Inside there was just 4-5 Vendors
slowly setting up... Frank Konisky of the Peoples Car Co. had far and
away the largest display ( but then he usually does...)

	Gordi Davis of 4 ever 4 was there, as well as Clay and Mary Smith of
Das Bulli Haus. We cruised around the room for 1/2 hr or so greeting old
friends and making new ones through-out the room... By 10:30 things were
starting to pick up... there were around a dozen Vendors setup and most
were several people deep at their tables...

	Lots of Really nice stuff.  Prices tended to be widely disparate.. I
bought a NOS '69 KG owners for $20, the next table had one for $35...one
fella had NOS KG dealer brochures for $30 ( from '63 up to '74) and
Beetle from '60-'79 ( prices varied there).

	Nevin Lescher of Windsor Locks CT was there with the Vanagon Westy Aux
step that he makes... He replaces the front table with an adjustable
height post on top of which is a non-slip 6&quot; pad to use to &quot;Step&quot; up
into the upper berth... this is a direct replacement for the table and
seems very useful... he gets $20-$25 + $5 shipping... He also makes a
fold up step for outside sliding door... Nevin is also a &quot;Carefree of
Colorado&quot; awning dealer and had a couple of those on Display ( pricing
seemed good, 10' hardshell awning for $287, 8' were under $250... Add a
rooms were in the same price range...)

	Frank Konisky was very generous with me when approached for prizes for
the LiMBO &quot;Kampers at Keyser Pond&quot; trip this summer in NH...
	He donated a Brand new Brekina 5 pc set of Baywindow Models (retail
$65) and several of the Kovap Tin Baywindow toys.  These will be prizes
for winners of the Mini-golf Tournament we will be holding at the
Campground on June 28th...

	By the time we left ( we had a 3 hr drive ahead of us) at 12:30 the
place was really hopping and every table was packed with goodies...

	The piece I was most tickled about buying is an early '60s Beetle 'Vert
model by &quot;Pyro&quot; called &quot;Beach Buggy&quot; unassembled, original box
w/instuctions... This has cut-out doors and a hard Surrey top
w/fringe...Pyro made 2 Beetle Models in the early 60s' and I had found
the other one last summer (complete, unassembled) at the NH Show and
Swap...This one is an early '60s' Sunroof with engine out and 2 mechanic
figures &quot;fixing it&quot;... Detail on both is very good and Original price
was a Buck!

	Didn't find any &quot;$500 Barndoor Deluxes&quot; in the parking lot, but did
find some other nice stuff for reasonable prices and we had a good
time...

		Take Care all...
