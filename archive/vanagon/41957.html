&gt;I've seen copper nuts sold for use on exhaust studs for upright engines.  Is
&gt;this also a good solution, or are there problems associated with
&gt;using/torquing down the comparatively softer copper nuts.  I'd bet the
&gt;copper nuts are cheaper than the stainless too so if the net result is the
&gt;same (no struggling with frozen nuts) is copper the way to go?
&gt;

Take a magnet with you when you buy 'copper' exhaust nuts.  All of the ones
I've seen were steel nuts with a thin plating of copper, about as useful as a
mammaries on a male swine.  Indeed, the ones carried at the local VW shops
here in northern San Diego County are nothing more than improperly fabricated
stop-nuts without the nylon insert -- stop nuts may be had in zinc, cadmium
or copper finish.  

Exhaust nuts are bronze, brass or stainless steel.
