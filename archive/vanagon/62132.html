&gt; So I'm standing there scratching my head, when I have one of those
&gt; miraculous revelations, and go straight to the problem!  On the
&gt; throttle, the top little switch!  Clicks (on or off?) when you open the
&gt; throttle.  Disconnect and the problem goes away!
&gt; 
&gt; So I run down to the local inspection guy, but he's booked for the rest
&gt; of the afternoon.  Try tomorrow.
&gt; 
&gt; QUESTIONS:  What is this thing?  Do I need it?
&gt; 
&gt; And it starts everytime (so far!)
&gt; 
The full-throttle switch cuts out the closed-loop circuit from the FI
system.  At full throttle, your engine runs solely on the air-flow
sensor and rpm.  If disconnecting this helps, it probably means that the
switch is shorted *and* you have a bad air-flow box.  The O2 sensor,
the main part of closed-loop operation, can do wonders in correcting
the mixture, but generally makes too lean a mixture for full-throttle.
The air-flow box is pretty easy to temporarily fix, and rebuilt ones 
are not too bad in price.
