 Your 13 year old doesn't want to be seen in your bus?

 Seems odd, our '74 Westy is very popular with the neighborhood teengers. They
 sometimes &quot;party&quot; in it sitting in the driveway. One of my 14 year old son's
 most *babelike* friends commented, when surveying the driveway sculpture &lt;'74
 bus and '73 MGB&gt; &quot;your parents have the _coolest_ cars, I especially like 
 that van.&quot; The neighborhood male teens now consider the bus to be the supreme 
 automotive babe-magnet.......Go figure.

 By the way, what has your son suggested that you &quot;replace&quot; the van with?a
