Subject: Hiya...still running in Raleigh, NC!

hey now,

wow...i'm still running! i went to the mountains last weekend...had no major
problems...ran into richard palmer on the way back and we caravaned back to
raleigh from around burlington. i had stopped to check my oil (you'll see why
later...) and richard was putting in brake fluid. and older gentleman came over
and said: &quot;Those VW's will run forever won't they?&quot;. got lots of looks going
down i-40 but no waves the entire weekend.

somethings i've noticed:

a) gas milage: jumped up dramatically with change of fuel filter and new air
filter a week ago. before: 15mpg tops. now: 22mpg.._dot_combination of city/highway
driving. not bad me thinks...what's about average for a '74 with a single
weber carb?

b) the OIL LEAK: still leaking. nothing major. drove about 300 miles this
weekend...in the mountains too..didn't add any oil. i THINK the leak is coming
from the oil breather box. the seal looks kinda of old...i've got a couple on
order from VW...$2.00 each. like i said i'm not losing a bunch of oil. there is
a slit drip underneath...but the majority of it gathers on top to the right
of the carb. the distributor wires running in front of the breather box are
oily like it's coming from the box. the box itself is on tight on back.(rear of
bus) but i can wiggle the front a little bit. i'm hoping it's the seal. this
van never leaked oil until i changed the filters.

c) hole put in interior roof- grrrrr....my friend tom was putting up the
curtain and stuck the rod through the material covering the roof. the interior
is immaculate and i was mildly pissed but got over quickly when tom came up
with the idea of heating rocks in the fire and then putting them in the van to
warm it up! (kinda chilly in the mountains) so how do i fix this? i've got
some white patch material and figured this would work.

d) broke lever on window sliding door- this one i did. i was working open the
window and (_at_#$!›%*) broke the knob off.

e) the van did extremely well up the steeper grades. no problem whatsoever.

things to do still:

1) new tie rods....ones on there are bent and in need of replacing.
2) adjust carbeurator and choke. taking care of this today. having a trusted
person show me how to do this on this modified carb.
3) timing- taking care of this as well
4) oil breather box seal
5) fix right rear tail lights. waiting for assembly to come in the mail..should
be here shortly i believe.
6) brake vacuum hose replacement. brakes work fine but would be better
when i fix this. this would make the engine run better i think? or not?
7) make a permanent platform in the back. got a nice temp. one now.
8) fix the heater fan...it's getting to be a little chilly down in nc.
9) find a gas heater...
10) get inspected. doubt i'll pass emessions tho. find a sticker
somewhere.

i love my vw!
