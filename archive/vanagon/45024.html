&gt; &gt; video.  It was great to see this Bus basking in the light of day.  Well,
&gt; &gt; maybe no *so* great.  The bright sun revealed several blemishes and small
&gt; &gt; spots of surface rust (rock chips, etc.).  I also noticed an additional
&gt; &gt; bit of body damage (the rear apron had been &quot;bent&quot; to allow the use of a
&gt; &gt; Beetle muffler at some point [tho' the Bus currently sports the correct
&gt; &gt; single tip exhaust]).

&gt; Oh whine, boo hoo, whine, SLAAPPP, somebody hit him already.

&gt; OK I admit I'd be gloating too.

OK, I may be gloating.  After countless beater (and worse) Busses, I 
finally have a good one and I just want to &quot;share&quot;.

Gloat mode on:

I pulled the seats and floor mats out this morning.  Lots of greasy dust 
balls (fun to clean!), screws, and other bits, but *no rust*.  The 
passenger area mat does have quite a few stains (paint, varnish, whatever 
else was hauled in here at one point).  Has an interesting &quot;bubble&quot; at 
one point (about 6&quot; in diameter) (??).  I may use the mat out of my '61 
instead.

More to come ...

Bob
