Subject: condensation - it's raining in the vanagon

Yesterday, I drove aobut 450 miles.  The drive was smooth, but it was 
raining in the back for about the first 300 miles....got the cushions 
thoroughly soaked.  In acase anyone is confused, the AC was on the whole 
time.  So, is there some tube through which this condensation is supposed 
to drain.  The AC on my '87 is in the back because of the pop top.  The 
water was dripping primarily out of the way back (by the speakers and 
rear hatch), but also out of the vents .  

Anybody have any solutions to this problem?  If I had any passengers, 
they oculd take a shower in the deluge.
