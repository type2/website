I had someone break off an ignition key in my old SAAB.  The putz then tried
to drill the broken key stub out of the lock (last time I loan him a car!!!)

I got a different steering column (w/ lock -key) from a friend.  The
locksmith made a key for the new ignition switch (to get the lock cylinder
out you have to turn it with a key).  We then removed the cylinder and
exchanged tumblers to key the new cylinder to the old keyset (doors, trunk
etc.).  We had to leave 1 tumbler out, leaving 5 that matched the old keys.

Don't know how much the above might cost as this was done for me as a favor
(I even got to help!!!).
