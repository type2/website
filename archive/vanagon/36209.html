Hi Brett

I statically timed my '77, and it seemed better than before I had
done it, but the jury's still out on how to time it with a strobe;
I never did it.  From what I understand, it's better to do the timing
with a strobe.

	Good luck

&gt; Is it ok to static time my fuel injected '77 westy as explained in the Muir
&gt; book?  He mentioned something about timing the later fuel injected models
&gt; with a strobe.  I would prefer to static time it if it is ok to do so.
&gt; Also, my Muir book only covers models up to 1973 (mines a 1977).  Is there
&gt; a more recent edition available that covers the late 1970s and if there is,
&gt; are the changes in it significant (should I buy it?).  The edition I own
&gt; is a family heirloom, passed to from father to son.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Brett
