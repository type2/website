&gt; 
&gt; propane tank.  If you have gasoline in your gas tank then your heater will run.
&gt; Simple.  The Eberspachers are very safety engineered, there are quite a few
&gt; cutoff switches in the event of  malfunction. And the whole unit mounts under
&gt; the center of your bus, out of the way - not under the back seat taking up much
&gt; needed storage space like a propane heater would. 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not biased, I'm just warm......gas heaters - safe, practical, the way to go!
&gt; 

I don't know if you were referring to my post or not, but I was not knocking
the Eberspacher heaters.  I was specifically referring to Kathy and Marks
Stewart Warner heater which seems to be meant for driving only.  I've seen
the Eberspachers in action as well at the first CCC's trip in Tobin and 
Christa Copley's van.  It seemed to do a good job.  I'm not sure if you
could mount the heater in the vanagon engine compartment or not.  Anybody
else know?
