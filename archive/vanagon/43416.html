Subject: Busses on '66'/KOA Phone #

Other flyer screw ups.  The Busses on '66' flyer didn't have the phone 
number for the Springfield KOA.  For reservations of an individual site 
(w/hookups) or a Kamping Kabin (for the Bus impaired) call 
1-800-383-5915.  If you're going to stay in our open camping area, you 
don't need a reservation.  See ya soon!
