Subject: Re: New Bus!

I admit it, I got sucked right in. I was right there, too, buying that bus and 
living the experience. Is the line true about having as many buses as you want 
but only one girl? And...does it always have to be the same girl?

Thom you're a mad-man.

&gt; &quot;close your eyes&quot; says I!  And we go out, and the bus is gone.  The whole

&gt; your mouth and go have some more nite crawlers.  Happy friday.
