&gt;           Well, Bradley ...being over 6'2 1/2&quot; I tried driving a splitie
&gt;           but I got tired of bending down to see or mistaking the metal 
&gt;           piece in the middle for a tree in the road. No, I like my view
&gt; unobstructed and panoramic...not looking through a porthole.

Well, Maaaaartin...  being over 6' 4 13/32&quot; I find the roof line on my 
breadloaf obstructs my vision as I enter deep creek beds or lay down some 
rubber at the local skateboard park.  .  I need the roof line raked way 
back so it won't cut in that way...  hmmm...  sounds like a....  
EUROVAN!!  OMIGOD!

Wash!  Help!  I can't breathe!  I can't sit up strai{[_at_++?^ ~(
