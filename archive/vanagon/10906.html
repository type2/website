Today on the way to work the normally free-flowing I-8 was jammed.
After crawling along for a mile or so I came upon the accident, and
horror of horrors, it was a late model westy, lying on it's side across
the two fast lanes.  No clue as to how it got that way, but it appeared
the driver was unhurt, if it was the lady I saw talking to the highway
patrolman at the scene.  Chalk another no-injury accident up to the VW
engineers...
