I wish it snowed here.  You are making me feel hard-done-by.  
I'd love to experience the kinds of drive you mentioned below.

I wrote-off a Jetta after skidding on hailstones in 1990.  Is 
it something like that?

Heh heh.  Silly Bushrat.

&gt;&gt; Hello again gang,
&gt;&gt; the sound has gone away.  So I can't experiment to 
&gt;find conditions to make
&gt;&gt; it come again ... but now here's a real stumper ...
&gt;&gt; Although I'm not the kind who takes drugs I'd swear 
&gt;that when I drive my
&gt;&gt; vanagon through snow (which is falling rapidly) that 
&gt;around 25-30 mph,
&gt;&gt; the world takes on a different sence.  Instead of me 
&gt;driving on the road,
&gt;&gt; the road is going under me while I am standing still. 
&gt; This same 
&gt;&gt; sensation hits my wife also ... and almost at the 
&gt;same speed.
&gt;&gt; Has anyone else noticed this ?  It is not something I 
&gt;have ever noticed with
&gt;&gt; another vehicle.  For those that have noticed this, 
&gt;what do you do to
&gt;&gt; return your concentration to reality?
&gt;&gt; Perhaps it is just that the vanagon runs so smoothly 
&gt;at 30 mph.  Perhaps
&gt;&gt; it's too much propane.  Who knows?
&gt;
&gt;DO NOT ATTEMPT THE FOLLOWING IN TRAFFIC.  Your 
&gt;observation is correct (Author's opinion). Now just use 
&gt;the park  lights (assuming you have the ones with the 
&gt;bulbs in the headlight  housing) on a dark night in a 
&gt;&quot;big flake&quot; snowstorm.  I have taken few  fine tours on 
&gt;backroads using this technique. Spin off advantage: No 
&gt;eyestrain with reflected light off the snow.
