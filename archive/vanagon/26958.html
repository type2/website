And now for something completely different...

By idiot lights I don't mean tailgator (a Southern creature, great fried 
w/grits) deterrence, but the magic red and green lights.

I've been going all this time w/out them, and wish to rectify the situation.

My question is thus:

Where, why and how are they supposed to be set up?  St Muir really isn't any
help because he makes the assumption that you already posess the appropriate
wiring... Mine is in an undefined state, and much cussin' and testin' hasn't
provided any usefull results, so I was going to run new wires, along
with a couple extras in case I wanted to add guages later.

I guess what I need is a rough schematic for the oil and gen warning systems.

Thanks!

Thom
