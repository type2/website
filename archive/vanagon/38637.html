Subject: '88 Trans Oil refill qty ?

Just got around to looking for the trans fill hole - nicely hidden 
behind the shift linkage - I wish they'd put it on the other side - 
there appears to be lots more room...

Anyway, after studying the Bentley, I'm now totally confused. On page 
34.1a, it says my trans takes 3.0l, but a footnote then says: &quot;refill 
capacity only; 1.5l cannot be drained&quot;. Then, on p35.32 it states 
capacity at 3.0l, saying to fill 15mm below filler hole, but no 
mention of this 1.5l amount. ??? 

What gives? I don't want to drain it &amp; find only 1.5l comes out,
which would then give me a mix of old oil , with the new Redline MTL
I bought. I was hoping to warm it up &amp; change the oil today, so any 
advice would be greatly appreciated!

Also, by again studying the Bentley &amp; becoming quite confused, I've 
deduced that: trans code DU &amp; ABD were used for '85 model 091/1 
trans, and thereafter trans code ACW model 091/1 trans were used. 
It doesn't mention a difference between the ABD &amp; ACW - since gear 
ratios appear to be the same... Mine's an ACW, and a factory rebuild 
as shown by an X after it.

Thanks!

ps: I also noticed my lifters quieted after about 5-10 seconds when I
put in Mobil 1 and VW filter. With the old 10w30/cheapo filter from
the PO, the lifters would clatter for 2-3 minutes or more...
