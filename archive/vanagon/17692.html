&gt; Is there a trick to this? I tried a few weekends ago and I couldn't get

&gt; dirty, but I tried to clean them the best I could with contact cleaner. I
&gt; have heard of people using acid flux, but I worry about residual flux
&gt; corroding the wire.

The trick is that you have to get the whole connection really hot.  This
won't work if the connectors have the plastic coverings, of course.  You
hold the soldering iron on the connector at the point where the wire
joins it for maybe 20 seconds, then add the solder once the whole thing
is good and hot.  You can't solder onto cold metal.
