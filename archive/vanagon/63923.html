&gt; hello listees-
&gt; 
&gt; This is a bit dated, but I figured I shoudl alert you
&gt; guys/gals as well.  I have yet to be able to get BusBoys
&gt; on the phone since the day this happened.....
&gt; 
&gt; I should have known if I said something good about
&gt; someone- they'd turn around and stab me in the back!!!
&gt; 
&gt; BUS BOYS did just that!!
&gt; 
&gt; In early July I ordered VDO gauges from BusBoys.
&gt; They said they were on back order.  I said ok.
&gt; They call me two weeks later to tell me they can't
&gt; get what I wanted.  I SPECIFICALLY stated that I
&gt; wanted to get them all from the same source.
&gt; I SPECIFICALLY stated that I wanted to CANCEL
&gt; my order.  The guy on the phone said OK. DONE.
&gt; Handled, no problem, ORDER CANCELLED!!!
&gt; 
&gt; That was over two weeks ago.
&gt; 
&gt; I called the bank today to check my balance-
&gt; OVERDRAWN- WHAT!?!?!?!  I check the detailed
&gt; debits/credits there is a charge for $211.06.
&gt; I'm at loss- so I call the bank to inquire.
&gt; They look it up and say 'yes- that came from
&gt; a place called Bus Boys.'  I tell her the story,
&gt; she tells me to call them then call her back.
&gt; I call them, damn machine!
&gt; 
&gt; Here's what makes it even worse!  I'm leaving
&gt; for phish tour in the morning.  I'm low on cash
&gt; as it is.  I have a DAT tape order about to hit
&gt; my account! The lady at the bank said there is
&gt; no way to for me to get the money back this week.
&gt; To top it off, I will not get the overdraft charge
&gt; back ever!!!
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not a violent man- but if Bus Boys was
&gt; within driving distance......
&gt; 
&gt; Do not give your card # to someone you do not
&gt; trust completely.  From this day forward anything
&gt; shipped to me will be COD. (with the exception
&gt; of the honest people I have had good dealings
&gt; within the past.)
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions?
&gt; Who can I report this blatant example of
&gt; BAD BUSINESS PRACTICES to?
&gt; 
&gt; PISSED OFF-
&gt; Rob
