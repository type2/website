Subject: Re: Air conditioning...in a 78 Westy? huh?

your right they were a factory option. I have one of these units from a
passenger bus. i can't imagine what kind of fuel economy you would have
with that baby run on full!

&gt;&gt;Though I'm not an expert, I didn't think they offred A/C on pre-Vanagon
&gt;&gt;Westys.  Zowee!  I'll have to take a look next time I see my 79.
&gt;&gt;Chris &quot;the Ontario-an&quot;
&gt;&gt;79 Westy
&gt;
&gt;I've seen A/C units in buses back to 1972.  The units placement have
&gt;been in 3 areas.
&gt;
&gt;#1.     In passenger buses: above the front seats.
&gt;
&gt;#2.     In campers: behind the front seats.
&gt;
&gt;#3.     In both passenger buses &amp; campers: below the the entire length
&gt;        of the dash.
&gt;
&gt;These were both factory options and dealer options.
