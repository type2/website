&gt;Knowledgeable friend says I need new air flow sensor.  YIKES! 
&gt;Big $$$!  Any other ideas?  Thanks.

Big bucks is right.  HOWEVER, I would think this is the LAST possibility.
 First, there are diagnostic tests you can do (see Bentley's) to check the
Air Flow Meter.  Second, there are about a dozen or two possibilities that
could be the cause of your problem that you should check first.  For example,
have you checked the contact of the wires on your starter?
