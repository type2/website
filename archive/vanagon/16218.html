I believe your bus could be a Sportsmobile conversion out of Andrews, Indiana
(like mine!) or possibly an Adventurer High Roof out of California.  I know
Sportsmobile is still in business doing conversion vans (Fords and Chevys -
yuck!), but I'm not sure about Adventurer.  I have a Sportsmobile camper that
I put Adventurer cabinets in, so they both sound familiar!
