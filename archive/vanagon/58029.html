Contact me at philf_at_sequent_dot_com.  I work in Beaverton.  Maybe some of the
others in the area would like to get together sometime soon.  The weather is
looking nicer.

     Joel,

     How about a stoopid statz by location?

     I would be interested to know who the other 42 members are that live
     in Northwest Portland with me.

     I think there must be twenty of them within a 2 block radius of me,
     and I haven't met any of them.

     Take care yo' self.
