Subject: Volvo Turbo-Diesels/Vanagon conversion

Hey now,
        Ok all you conversion minded folks out there, here's the info I
talked about last week. Like I said, sounds like the hot#3 we airheads deal
with. Something you may want to consider before plunking down the $$$ for a
conversion. (If you missed the previous post, this note is from my dad, who
bought his '85 volvo 740 turbo diesel new)
&gt;
&gt;Hi Kiddo,
&gt;
&gt;The thing I have been told about the Volvo 6 cylinder Turbo Diesel in
&gt;my 85 740GLE is that it burns hot on the number 6 piston and as a result
&gt;doesn't have the longevity a diesel should have.  I have three data
&gt;points.  I know of two engines that crapped out at 150,000 and 225,000
&gt;miles.  Mine has about 206,000 miles on it and is still going strong.
&gt;
&gt;Pops

        Hope this helps someone.

Peace,
