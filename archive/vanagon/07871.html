Subject: Re: Coolant gauge/light secrets revealed!


&gt;&gt;Now, if I can only figure out why the headlights go off and the radio
&gt;&gt;stays on when I shut off the ignition ...  :-)
&gt;
&gt;and the parking light stay on. i think it has something to do with the laws
&gt;in germany, about parking on the side of the road. Mercedes has a light
&gt;switch that allows you to not only turn ON the parking lights, but to decide
&gt;if you want (1) Left side parking lights, (2) Right side parking lights, or
&gt;(3) BOTH side parking lights. :) so if you park on the left side of the road,
&gt;you have to turn on only the left side parking lights (to warn other folks
&gt;that you are there).

I've got to mention my Dad's VW Polo again here. I think the German 
engineers had a bet in the office one day on how many functions they could 
fit on one switch. There are two stalks on the steering column. One controls 
the front and rear wipers and washers. You have to use some variation on 
Morse code to get the things to work. Press it toward you to get the rear 
wiper to work, press it twice for high speed, press it three times for 
intermitent, two long and one short to stop it, 
dot-dot-dot-dash-dot-dash-dash to work the washer, etc, etc. The other works 
about ten zillion different lights. If you leave the indicators on and 
switch off the ignition, it leaves the parking lights on on that side. Pull 
it towards you twice to switch on the front fog lights, but only if the 
headligts are already on, otherwise it just flashes the high beams. (I still 
don't know how to switch them off without turning the headlights off) Many's 
the time when I've driven round with the wipers going like crazy and the 
lights blazing on a sunny day because I can't work out how to switch the 
damn things off. Kids would point at me in the street. And I would turn 
everything else on and off while frantically prodding all the switches at 
random to see which one does what. I could think I'd managed to turn off the 
rear wiper but it would make one sweep every now and then when I was looking 
the other way. The parking lights had me completely stumped the first time I 
borrowed the car so, as a last resort, I dug out the manual but I'm sure 
they'd translated it into chinese as a joke or something.
