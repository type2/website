Subject: Re: Anyone need '68 camper-top?

&gt;
&gt;Greetings!
&gt;
&gt;	Sorry to post a &quot;for sale&quot; on this list, but if I don't find a 
&gt;home for this item YESTERDAY, it's going to the dump. 
&gt;	My bro. bought a 68 for parts, and scrapped what he didn't need-
&gt;except the small (4'x4'?) square pop-top.  No canvas, just the top.  Does 
&gt;anyone need it?  Seattle area. Email to address below...
&gt;


Endorsement:   If anyone wants an easy Westy conversion, this top is it!. I 
installed one, took a day, easy cutting/edging (see prev. post). The top 
worked well, stayed down tight, no leaks/breezes and added the right amount 
of headroom for standing/cooking etc. I also added a really solid marine 
hatch, epoxy coated aluminium/tempered glass into the popup. Add a large 
rear roof rack, and voila, instant Westy.        tim s.
