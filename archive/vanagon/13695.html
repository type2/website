&gt;&gt;Wow.  I wish I could say the same.  All my readings were so

&gt;&gt;Almost half of specs.  Oh well.  Maybe it's the type of driving I do 
&gt;&gt;with the van?  I drive 99% highway, hardly ever in town, and this is

&gt;&gt;Hmm.

Harry, I am wondering if you got a meter that was not accurate. It's not
very likely all wires happened to lose half of their resistance all at
the same time. Did you use a analog VOM to measure the resistance?
Analog VOM meter's Ohm measurement section can be easily damaged if
used to measure voltage by mistake. And it happed a lot. When this 
happened and if the meter is damaged the result of Ohm measurement
could be half off. 

Try a different meter. Good luck.
