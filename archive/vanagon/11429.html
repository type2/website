Hi All,
Sorry to lump all this together, but I'm getting this in digest mode, so
I guess I'll just regurgitate it back the same way 8).

Re: the individual looking for the yard with all the heaters (25), I have
    written down -
    Interstate VW, Used Parts
    1303 Engineer Street
    Vista CA 92083
    (619) 598 - 1376

Hope that helps.  As I recall, the original poster complained that they
weren't very responsive concerning pieces and parts.  YMMV.  I have no
experience with them.

Re: the individual with a '78 (?) looking to recirculate interior air from
underneath the back seat; look for an Eberspacher BA6 (currently in use in
my '81) that's being parted out or buy the whole thing.  I had to cut a
hole underneath the rear seat to provide return air to the auxilliary fan,
which plumbs into the heater duct.  There's also a section of plumbing that
connects to the existing heater duct plumbing from the heater boxes.  There
are little flaps in the plumbing that make sure the air from the aux. fan
doesn't blow air back into the boxes.  I have no idea how well this will
work without the heater in place, but it sounds like what you're looking
for.

If you find a BA6 and want some help with the hookups/troubleshooting let
me know, I'm pretty much an expert ( 8( ) on them at this point.
