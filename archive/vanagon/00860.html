Subject: Re: Re-installing distributer drive gear, T4

Actually, I think you're fine... the stock 73 distributor and the 009
are 90 degrees different in their #1 position.

Just make sure you eyeballed that drive-dog slot like in the picture,
with correct attention to the big and little sides of the split.
