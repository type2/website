&gt; Tom F.Tom, sorry I misled you I mean hot footwell mod
I found during really hot weather although the AC was on my feet were 
burning up....Then I found reference to the HOT footwell mod on page 
19.20 of my bently manual..it refers to cutting the cardboard baffle 
located around the radiator allowing cool air to pass over the foot well 
instead of directing the hot radiator air on to one's feet
It works Ok but i would like to have completed it by installing the foil 
insulating pad refered to in the manual..
