So Richard Alexand Palmer says:
&gt; &gt; appeared), branching off away from the jam-packed highway off into the
&gt; &gt; sunset (or sunny skies anyway). Just cruisin' along.
&gt; Or how about this:
&gt;  aerial shot of the bus, a camper, in a traffic jam. Everyone else is screaming
&gt; and cussing, but inside the bus, the folks have folded out the table, and are
&gt; having a pleasant dinner. that would be cool indeed. The caption could be:
&gt; Volkswagen campers- you're _never_ late coming home for dinner!

Or.... how 'bout this:

set with all kinds of food and servants moving around pampering everyone.

    Caption: Volkswagen Campers - There's more to them than just driving...
