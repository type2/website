Subject: Jacob's Bugpack on a Vanagon

Has anyone attempted to put one of those Jacob's BugPacks on their WB
Vanagon? I picked one up at a very cheap price and  I have been
wondering if it will work. I called them and the tech told me that they
made one specifically for vanagon. He said he would take a trade of the
unit that I have plus $150 for the vanagon unit. I called back the next
day and another guy said &quot;no problem, the unit that I have will work
just fine&quot;. I got one of their brochures and they say the omnipack
(bugpack for VW) works on any car, truck or boat. The exceptions were
for GM HEI and one or two others. Do any of the electronics
knowledgeable know exactly what the bugpack does? I don't want to fry
anything on my camper for an experiment. TIA
