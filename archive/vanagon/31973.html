Subject: Re: VWs in Ads

&gt;Wasn't there an ad out a few years ago for the Corrado that had a Beetle
&gt;being dropped off a cliff?  I think the voice-over said something like
&gt;&quot;Before, this was the only way to get a Volkswagen to accelerate form
&gt;0-60 in less than 8 seconds(or however fast it was).&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Maybe I'm just making stuff up, I can't remember for sure.

you were right i saw the ad myself a few years ago. i personally thought it
was blasphemy to drop a bug like that. i wonder what became of the bug ???
can you say bug pancake??
