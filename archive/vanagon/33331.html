Subject: Re: RE: speedometer error

OOPS, sorry in UK a tachometer is called a rev-counter so what I meant is
that my speedometer always appears to read fast when compared to other
traffic on the road. The speedo correlates to the tachometer with the ratio
of 18mph/1000rpm. I have P195/75R14 tyres on my 70 westy. I think they came
with cross-ply tyres so the tyres that I a using may be too small, is the
correct size 205/75*14?? or what is the factor by which I divude the
speedometer reading.

TIA  sam williams
