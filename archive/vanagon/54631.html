Subject: Re: Mystery dash outlet '83.5 GL Westy

&gt;Are you nuts to pay 12 USD for a plug which fits this awful socket in
&gt;your Westy? I would pay a quarter of this amount for that plug. And,
&gt;maybe except USA, this plug is not a Hella only item.
&gt;
&gt;But I'm not lucky with this plugs. I always mounted Banana sockets into
&gt;my cars to run aux. equipment. Of cause, someone may do the mistake to
&gt;plug into wrong direction but they have good connections even to
&gt;drive the CB radio. Bananas are cheap and everywhere to use.

Actually, It is a HELLA only item. VW Westfalias are the only vehicle here in
the US that have this type of outlet, (aside from the BMW motorcycles) that I am
aware of.  This is not a standard &quot;cigarette lighter&quot; outlet size here in the
US.  I called the BMW cycle dealer, as someone had mentioned, and they wanted
$35 dollars for the same thing!  If someone can find it for less than $12, let
me know.  I'm talking about using it in my '79 westy - where there is NO
cigarette lighter, or a outlet such as that, except the HELLA outlet under the
glovebox. It would be easier for me to buy a $12 plug, than spend time drilling
a hole in the dash and wiring up a conventional Pep Boyz cigarette lighter
outlet. To my knowledge, 1980 was the first year a cigarette lighter was
STANDARD in any VW van (US models, at least). 
Does anyone know if you can get the plug here in the US for under $12??  That's
the best price I got so far. 

p.s. I tried to mount a banana on my dash, but it just got all squishy in the
sun, and fell off.   :&lt;)
