:so here i sit, wallowing in post-partum depression. it's not much fun to
:sell a bus. even less enjoyable to see it drive off. it was really strange
:to see TWO double-cab pickups driving off down the street. kinda neat.
:but for me, kinda sad. like watching your favorite grandma leave after
:christmas. money isn't much of a comforter for those kinds of days.
:especially since i'll likely have to buy a clutch for my brother's rabbit. :(
:
:i guess the only thing to cheer me up would be a double-cab vanagon pickup.
:;)   sigh. life can be so cruel sometimes.
