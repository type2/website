Subject: Sortof own a splitty


Did I ever tell ya that i kinda own a splitty?  It's a 
splitty, but not a VW. It's a '68 Dodge van. Has a split 
front windshield, and the engine between the driver and 
passenger seats. It's a neat vehicle. In its first life it 
was a repair truck for Bell Telephone. Then it was bought by
my father-inlaw for the Kiwanis. It was restored by the 
local vo-ed. and painted dark blue. After Kiwnais no longer 
needed it, my father-in-law bought it back, then put a home 
built interior in it. Had a table and bench seats that 
turned into a bed. Was dubbed &quot;The Whoppie Wagon&quot;. When Dad 
was finally whoppied out, the interior - made from particle 
board - was crumbling, we got it. For free. Way cool! So now
it lives with us. As long as it has a strong battery, it 
always starts. Always, even at -20F. It's sort of sad 
looking. It had a run in with a split rail fence one icy 
day. But the frame isn't bent. It really is a cool van. We 
even relived our foolish youth in it last summer. Crammed 13
people in it and motored out the a Pink Floyd concert in it.
But that's another story.
