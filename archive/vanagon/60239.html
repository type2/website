&gt;
&gt;I would have to agree though, that in concept, the VW Bus was one of the
&gt;first &quot;mini-vans.&quot;

One of the first? 
When the big 3 saw how VW was doing with the microbus out came the
Greenbrier (sp?) and the Econovan, I don't recall what dodge came out with. 
The VW was the first and only. Speaking of Greenbrier, coming over the
Mackinaw bridge I saw a Eurovan with a pop top (white), Just on the other
side as I was getting off 75 I saw a Greenbrier. Now it's not a VW but I
don't see many old air cooled vans around here.
