&gt; Can anyone tell me what the tab on the back of the base

&gt; the size of a seatbelt clasp and it's simply bolted in
&gt; there.  What in the world is this for?  No one I've 
&gt; talked to has even a guess.  I thought it might be for
&gt; some sort of cargo strap, but there isn't a matching one
&gt; anywere else in the bus.

My guess is that it's for the earlier seats that have a hold down on the 
partition behind the seats.  So maybe you have a seat from an earlier bus.
