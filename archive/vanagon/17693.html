Subject: Car top tents and window screens

Martha and others wrote of car-top tents:

Michael Heron sent me a copy of an early-60's brochure for a very similar 
item by &quot;Dove Manufacturing&quot; -- will scan some of the pix in and put 'em 
on my tent page before too long.  The pix are real cool -- shows the tent 
set up on both Beetle and van.  I plan a re-do of my pages when the new 
Pentium arrives (!!) I love my old Tandy 3000NL '286 but oh, you Pentium!

Regardez window screens:
I made some for my ex-'68-Westy from various pieces of screen framing, 
fleshed out with sheet metal flanges to fill in the odd gaps.  I made 'em 
so you could just roll 'em up in the front door windows to pinch 'em in 
place.  A very handy set of gadgets.  They stored quite handily in the 
sunroof pocket between the &quot;ceiling&quot; and roof in the rear.
