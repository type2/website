Subject: .. while we're talking about wipers ... 

Before I start, I paid my bill for the damage the big blue 
thing did when it ate the butt of that Cavalier, before 
Christmas.  Two hundred and fifty pounds and four pence.  That 
is roughly $450.  A lot for an unemployed Bushrat.  :(  Mebbe I 
should save money and sell my computer :}   Apparantly, the 
rear lights on those suckers are verrrry expensive, as is 
uncrumpling the bodywork.  Good testimony to the qualities of 
T4s, though.  Besides a cool-looking severe bend in the bottom 
bar of the bullbar, the big blue thing is undamaged.  Next week 
, I might even open the bonnet (hood to you colonials) and 
check if the engine's alright.  :]

Anyway, to the point ...

It's funny that wipers should be so popular.  Steven's '91 T3 
and my big blue thing (the '91 T4) might be twins.  (Or it 
could be a rare VWirus)

Please bear in mind that I sit in the right hand seat when 
driving my Transporter, not the left.  That info might prevent 
your brain from melting while trying to figure out the problem. 
 This is a view from inside ...

\__________}______________}__/   &lt;-- They are wipers (I think.) 


The area marked with the hashes denotes the place that the 
wipers fail to clear properly.  It's also the area of the 
maximum sweep of the passenger-side wiper.  So what happens is 
that rain in that spot remains there and gets blown all over 
the place when the wipers go on the downstroke.  I've bent the 
wipers, the arms, the blades; I've bought new wipers with cute 
little aerofoils at fifteen pounds a pop; I've put bizarre 
toxic chemicals on the glass to make a more viscous passage for 
the blade.  Hell, I even tried to buy those five-in-one blades 
thingies this afternoon, but they were an inch too short.

Another T4 I know has the same difficulty.  I'm not too sure 
about young Galvo's Tranny, it being a '94.  What's the tale 
with the other Transporters out there?  (OK, I might call 'em 
Eurovans to help you along (choke!))

Ric?  Cetin?  Well???   :)
