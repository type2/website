Subject: Re: 6V Starter --&gt; 12V battery?

I had a 59 bus that had been converted to 12v when i bought it.  It had the
original wiper motot, which worked fine for about 2 years, when it started
going faster and faster and faster and...  well it got to the point that the
rods would pop off the pivot and id have to reach under the dash and wiggle
the pivot back and forth.  

Wiper motor, we dont need no steenking wiper motor 

okay, that got stale.  so i bought a voltage drop from bugformance for 10
bucks and i had a wiper motor again.  It only toke a couple minutes to
install

you can run a 6v starter on 12v,  but eventually it will burn out.  It will
burn out anyway.

or you can put a 12v solinoid on yr 6v starter

or put on 12v starter and flywheel, now or at some future time.

:) :) :) :) 

the possibilities,  and the grease,  are endless
