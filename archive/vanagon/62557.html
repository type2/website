Subject: Re: Thule roof racks for Westie-Help?

Totally different but related subject, can you get keys from Thule 
for a rack that came with the vehicle but with no keys.  The '81 has 
the racks mounted to the fiberglass, which is BTW holding up fine 
IMHO but I have no key and no way to get them off or acessories on.
