OK, one more time

Morgan saiz LPS has

&gt; Ingedients: (get out your chem. 1A text)
&gt; Aliphatic hydrocarbon, petrolium oil, Dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether

No need for the chem text, this is basic stuff.  Aliphatic hydrocarbons
could mean lotsa stuff, but here they probably mean a mixture of things
like pentanes, hexanes, heptanes, octanes, nonanes, decanes, etc,
etc....basically all solvents.  Petro oil-ahh, lube.  Anything from
vasoline to 5 wt and back to wheel bearing grease.  Probably a
crude mix taken straight from the hull of a ship.  Dipropylene glycol
monomethyl ether.....CH3OCH2CH2CH2OCH2CH2CH2OH, and isomers thereof.
Just for kicks I looked up what this stuff is used for.  Apparently,
it is used in the ink industry rather extensively (and several of the
abstracts of papers and patents I read mentioned that the resulting
ink when used in ball point pens prevents the corrosion of the ball
point-but there were other things in the ink that could have been 
responsible for the anti-corrosive properties)  One paper was
entitled &quot;Two-component permanent-waving composition for human hair&quot;,
...so maybe this IS the magic ingredient in waxoyl!

But no mention of wax or parrafin itself, aye??

&gt; If anyone has a waxoyl jug handy, let's compare ingredients.

Well, as I said, whatever it is it ain't on the label.  I made a
brief attempt to look up waxoyl.  Got nothin'.  Looked up 
hammerite (even though it isn't claimed to be in waxoyl, but waxoyl
is made by the same folks-the Hammerite Corporation, or something
to that effect-that market hammerite).  It turned up one reference
to a Copper-lead-bismuth sulfide complex, but it was on the
crystal forms of this stuff (which is apparently mined...and therefore
might not be considered &quot;chemical&quot; but rather &quot;mineral&quot; to  the
marketing folk who wrote the label I described earlier) and what
&quot;point group&quot; they fall into.  Nothing about its use.

I then spoke with an information specialist here at work...a library
dude.  He said that the composition was probably a trade secret, and
suggested the best he or I would come up with would be to find out
who makes the stuff...and we already know that.  He then went on to
tell a story about his grad school advisor that got so hung up on
the composition of a gas additive (that he couldn't find out from
the patent literature) that he had one of his students inject the 
stuff into a gc.....they basically watched peak after peak come
off for the rest of the day.  I don't think I'll be injecting
any waxoyl into my gc.

so there you have it-it's a trade secret.  But if you are &quot;hooked on
phonics&quot; and barely literate, you could probably figure out that
it has wax and oil in it.  If and when I find some parafin lying
around I think I'll toss it into some hexane, spray it on my 
fume hood on a metal area, park some nasty acid under it, and see
if the sprayed part offers any protection.

If it works, how much you wanna buy??
