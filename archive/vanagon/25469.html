Subject: 1977 Bus Valve Question

Hey Now

I'm hoping that there's someone out there somewhere who can help me out
with a valve adjustment question.  I'm going to Canada this weekend for
the Bus' first long trip (6.5 hrs each way!), and I want to be cool
with everything right up front.

I have a newly acquired 1977 Transporter (Campmobile).  This weekend, I
did my first tuneup since buying it, and the valves seemed to be pretty
well-adjusted, except for cylinder 2.  Cylinder 2 was pretty tight, so
I backed them off to .006&quot; per VW/Muir.  Would there be a reason for these
valves to be adjusted tight on purpose?  The engine seems really well-
maintained, so I'sd suspect first that this was done on purpose.

Also, the left side valves looked pretty brown (the right side valves
looked pretty clean).  Anything I should check/be suspicious of?  

	Thanks all!
