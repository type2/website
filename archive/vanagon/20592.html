&gt; I found a great way to keep those piece-au-shit (like mine) 
vanagons running &gt; and be able to have hassle -ree trips. 
&gt; 
&gt; Buy a FORD full-towing truck. The ones that actually put the whole car/van on
&gt; their bed. Put the van on the truck, and drive the truck wherever your heart
&gt; desires, unload the VAN and camp galore! Do the same to get back home!
&gt; This towing-truck is absolutely the ultimate VW owner companion. Don't leave
&gt; home without it.
