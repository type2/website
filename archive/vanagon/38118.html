Volks,
	This story was posted earlier today on the Fordnatics mailing list,
of which I am also a member.  It had a lot in common with stories that
have been posted on this list, so I thought you all would enjoy it even
though it has no VW content.  Kemper Porter (the author) has given me
permission to repost his story.  He is a member of a car club called the
&quot;Vicksburg Cruisers&quot;.  Apologies to those on both lists (probably just
Steve Maher) who have to see this twice.  :)  Hey, it *is* almost
Friday...

&gt; 
&gt; I picked a carpentry project this weekend. I built my wife a locker for her 
&gt; garden tools. As a younger man I worked the summer as a framer and could 
&gt; send a nail home with one mighty blow of my trusty claw hammer. It is a 
&gt; skill quite different from riding a bicycle I'm afraid - you can forget. My 
&gt; good friend Lance, of Lonesome Ford Garage fame, was reclining on his side 
&gt; observing impassively. He had in his hand a trowel and he was throwing it in 
&gt; the ground trying to get it to stick upright. The wife unit had her lips 
&gt; tightly pursed and I think she actually felt each miss-placed blow to my 
&gt; digits. I had double struck some of them and actually saw shooting lines on 
&gt; the inside of my eyelids. They looked to me like a road map of White Planes 
&gt; New York. I once got lost there. I was wondering if I could find the exit 
&gt; off the Mystic Valley Parkway that led to the cabinet shop where I could buy 
&gt; a locker for my wife and end this torment. Through attrition I was down to 
&gt; holding the nail with the pinkie and ring finger of my left hand. Opposable 
&gt; thumbs are greatly over rated, I found myself thinking. I don't need them! I 
&gt; could FALL out of the evolutionary tree just with what I have left.
&gt; &quot;I'm NOT a carpenter.&quot; I guessed wistfully. &quot;That's another thing you don't 
&gt; have in common with Jesus&quot; my wife replied.
&gt; It was looking pretty grim.
&gt; I was losing wifely support. My ring finger seemed to be saying &quot;take me if 
&gt; you must - But not the pinkie! Not the baby finger! I really needed an 
&gt; excuse to take a break. It came in the form of a Klaxon horn and a deep 
&gt; throaty rumble from out front. Lance paused his effort to reach China 
&gt; trans-terra and caught my eye. &quot;Steve&quot; we said. My wife waved me off happy 
&gt; for the chance to clean my body fluids off her locker before they &quot;stained 
&gt; it&quot;. &quot;Just bring back some groceries for lunch!&quot; she said.
&gt; Steve's ride is a T bucket. That's a car loosely based on a Model T Ford 
&gt; grossly overpowered and exceedingly dangerous. It's dangerous at launch, 
&gt; dangerous underway, dangerous in the rain, dangerous at idle, it's even 
&gt; dangerous looked at sideways parked in the driveway. Steve's was just as 
&gt; dangerous as any other T bucket ever to terrorize the Boulevard. It was 
&gt; short, and squant, and mostly engine. It was built two decades ago and 
&gt; sported the usual air brush graphics, in multiple hues of silver, that make 
&gt; the 70ies a period of embarrassment to most Street Rodders. Not me. I love 
&gt; the Rat Fink-eskness of the whole project. Ok, so this isn't the Beatnik 
&gt; Bandit, but it has it's appeal. Steve was appointed in the driver's street 
&gt; grinning at us through his salt and pepper beard. He had on rope soled deck 
&gt; shoes and a flowered shirt. He had his cap on backwards and looked like 
&gt; Catfish Hunter without his catcher's mask. I got the feeling we were going 
&gt; to have a meeting at the mound where we discussed the next batter and spit 
&gt; at each other's feet. A single key was stuck in the dash with a tiny silver 
&gt; chain attached from which a bloodshot eyeball with wings depended. Steve 
&gt; told us that was &quot;Van&quot;. I didn't ask. The dashboard was devoid of all other 
&gt; civilized accouterments like heater controls or radio dials. There were 
&gt; business gages only here. The glove box was also a delete option. Up front 
&gt; was the ubiquitous SBC (boo!) but it is topped by a genuine Scorpion Intake 
&gt; (YEAH!). The little critter sits below the carburetor stinger arched. Very 
&gt; ugly. I like it. On the floor was an automatic shifter off a Mustang II 
&gt; (yeah!) marked &quot;P&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, and &quot;GO&quot;. Just 'Tuck-n-roll' upholstery in grey 
&gt; dead nauga's hide filling the back expanses of the tub. Out back is a 
&gt; chopped Model T pickup bed topped with the same nauga motif. The huge 
&gt; rolling meat sticks out from the limited slip rear end smirking toward the 
&gt; world at large. All rolling stock is mounted on period perfect Crager SS 
&gt; mags. Lance took it for the first ride. The doors are sealed shut so you 
&gt; kind of jump in. The only advice Steve offered was &quot;watch the pipes, they're 
&gt; hot&quot;. After trying several different left leg positions, he fired 'er up. He 
&gt; shot off toward the cove and spun around leaning over the driver's side door 
&gt; into the turn. Weaving down the road toward us we stepped back up upon the 
&gt; curb. In a shot he sunk down the hill and turned right up the main hill out 
&gt; of our neighborhood. You could say he attacked that hill. The deep rumble of 
&gt; the motor faded but we heard the high pitched yodel of his laugh across the 
&gt; roof tops. He was back in no time. He braked at the bottom of the hill and 
&gt; the inside drum locked chirping the rear tire gleefully. Lance let out 
&gt; another Yodel and brought 'er to a stop. He must have contracted British Mad 
&gt; Cow Disease because he began babbling and his eyes were loco. Steve turned 
&gt; to me and said &quot;watch the pipes&quot;. My heart thumped. I shoved Lance out of 
&gt; the way and my lovely wife appeared and stepped on his foot climbing into 
&gt; shotgun. Friendship only goes so far. I immediately hit the leg room delema 
&gt; and decided on the &quot;under the chin gambit&quot;. This solution involves tucking 
&gt; your left leg up in front of the steering wheel altogether with your left 
&gt; heel a few inched below your tukus. We were off. I found the tea cup 
&gt; steering wheel twitchy but amazingly light. I tried to ease away from the 
&gt; stop but the car leapt forward at the lightest touch of the move pedal. I 
&gt; was leaning into the turn just as I had seen Lance do. As I passed Steve and 
&gt; Lance they jumped up on the curb. I made the same right as Lance and stopped 
&gt; at the main road. Straight across the street is the long wooded entrance to 
&gt; St. Michael's Catholic church. Looked good to me. We TOOK the road down to 
&gt; the church. It flattens out into an upper parking lot that swings away from 
&gt; the church and toward the parish house. The good parson came out at our 
&gt; approach and rotated his arms like helicopter blades. He was wearing a big 
&gt; floppy hat he no doubt picked up on some foreign mission (or maybe at the 
&gt; discount store, I don't know) and some cloth gloves with bright green 
&gt; thumbs. I envied those thumbs - especially the left one. He might have been 
&gt; saying &quot;I'll see you in confession.&quot; but I didn't stick around to see. Heck, 
&gt; I'm not even Catholic. I usually attend services at St. Mattress.
&gt; Wifey jumped out when we got back, pronounced the trip fun, and handed me a 
&gt; grocery list and made it clear there would be no lunch until I filled it. I 
&gt; asked Steve for another ride in his little grocery getter and he agreed. At 
&gt; the store we (or the car, or both) got several odd looks in the parking lot 
&gt; but no one called the police. Inside we both grabbed a cart. Steve didn't 
&gt; want anything but both of us wanted to drive. I threw in some extra junk 
&gt; food after first checking the contents to be sure I had gotten the maximum 
&gt; amount of MSG possible. We checked out and headed back to the ranch those 
&gt; new fangled plastic bags between my feet.
&gt; I'm afraid to say that experiments in quickness turned into top end 
&gt; explorations and we ran amuck of the speed limit. We hit a bump at the 
&gt; bridge leaving town and became air born, like all four corners. When we came 
&gt; down I landed on the groceries. I heard a loud POP and my view vaporized in 
&gt; a dervish of yellow free range cheetos. Steve grinned at me and pointed back 
&gt; over his shoulder. I stopped trying to snap cheetos out of the air in front 
&gt; of my nose and looked back to see that the cover for the pickup bed was 
&gt; gone. We had to go back for it. Steve was remarkably calm about it when we 
&gt; found it. It was of course scuffed and had a hole in the corner but he 
&gt; shrugged it off. &quot;That's hot rodding&quot; he said.
&gt; He began a demonstration of &quot;run-on tire adhesion&quot;. That's when you get 
&gt; going 55 or so and punch it to see if you can lite em up. He could. He did. 
&gt; Several times. Then the top half of the windshield decided that was enough 
&gt; with the herky jerky and it broke through the brass bracket on my side. 
&gt; Steve laughed some more and began to flail me with the top half of the 
&gt; window using the brake and throttle.
&gt; When we got back, Sally looked at the groceries and kicked us all out of the 
&gt; house. Steve said he had to go braise n' polish  the windshield bracket back 
&gt; together anyway and took off. That is the first time I have actually seen - 
&gt; up close - tires get bigger as they are spun. Lance and I retired to the 
&gt; garage where all the tools and car mags are anyway and &quot;made do&quot; until Sally 
&gt; felt like feeding us. I retold the Dukes of Hazzard jump we made over and 
&gt; over until we had actually cleared the entire bridge and landed in the next 
&gt; county.
