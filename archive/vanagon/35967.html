Hi everybody...

  Last night I was going through my maintenance records for my Vanagon
in preparation for my discussions with VWoA about paying for the head
gasket repairs on my '91. I was reviewing the info about maintenance
regarding what to do when and I couldn't find anything that said that
the coolant should be flushed and replaced every two years. I checked
the owner's manual, the maintenance manual, and the Bentley shop manual.
Does anyone know where this &quot;recommendation&quot; came from?

  By the way, Tim, you did a *great* job on explaining reasons for the
head gasket failure. It makes my top ten for the Vanagon list. :-)
