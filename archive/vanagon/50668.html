&gt; I hate to flog this one too much, but the front speakers on my '88

&gt; Some mentioned they may not be, so are there different speakers used 
&gt; on Westy's ? (the front are also identical to the rear mounted in the 
&gt; overhead cabinet).
&gt; Just curious.
I test drove a '91 Westy last week, and it had the speakers you describe.
Oh yeah, the '91 Westy is a GL model and it is at Kelly Motors for the low
low price of $16995 and they did not seem too interested in budging, least
not for me.
