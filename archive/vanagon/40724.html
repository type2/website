Subject: ENgine needed - ASAP PLEASE!

Marlin,

Experienced has shown the members of this list that GEX may not be
the best choice.  Have you looked at Berg, Bergmann, Scat, Pauter, or
even MOFOCO?  The first four are really good, and the last one may be
good, but there have been less serious complaints from them then from
GEX.  There is also many other companies out there, members on the
list have a list as long as your arm with whom they have had success
with new and rebuilt engines.

Just my $.02

Cheers,

David

Okay, going to make this short and sweet:

I need an engine for my '69 Westy.  I would like to get a complete one,
rebuilt w/ new accessories if possible.  I only want a single port, single
releif engine.

I am about to order a GEX longblock for $800.  If you have ANYTHING THAT IS
POSSIBLY BETTER LET ME KNOW!

I am in Stockton, CA which is near Sacramento.

Thanks
-Marlin
