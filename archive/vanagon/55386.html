Subject: Re: 1/87 Scale vanagons

An HO scale Caravelle by Herpa with the markings of the German Railroad
adorns the instrument panel cover on my '85.  Helps me remember where the
front end isn't when I'm parking.
Herpa makes all sorts of T3's and T4's including a T4 California coach
with a removable pop-top, veeery detailed.

P.S. on an older thread: my dashboard altar includes a rubber duckie, a
halibut hook, a dried horseshoe crab and a dried rose...
