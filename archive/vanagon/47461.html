Subject: 80 Westy FS

It is time to thin out my fleet, so my 80 Westy is going on the block. It is
the basic Westfalia, no stove, ice box instead of refr. Runs well with recent
heads and clutch. Interior is intact and shows minimum wear, exterior has
minor dings. Has a/c, though not charged so I can't vouch for its condition.
I am asking $2000, and it is in the SF bay area.

87 Syncro
80 Westy

Also possible sale items: 86 FS Bronco XLT black with all options, and a 68
Porsche
912 w/67 engine(no smog pump necessary) webers, bilsteins. Both are in
excellent condition.
