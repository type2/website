I have one comment.  I believe you said you used oil when you assembled
the rods on the crank.  If you use oil, the rods are gonna fall faster,
cause oil is relatively thin.  I would suggest trying this again but this
time use assembly lube instead of oil.  If the rods still fall fast, I
think you have a problem.  If they fall slowly with assembly lube and
fast with oil, you may not have a problem, but I would plastigage them
to be sure.  Remember to clean all of the oil/assembly lube off of the
bearings and journals before using the plastigage.
