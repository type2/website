**parts and spares, and made a major find: The sheet-metal pannel that
**covers the master-cylinder, handbrake cables, etc. My 69 came without
**one, Ken's 71 came without one and my 70 pickup came without one, and
**I can'r recall ever seeing one before, but I've got one now! $10!!
**Does anyone else not have one of these beauties for their T2? It does
**a kinda-important job and in my experience, they're rare.

Is this da belly-pan?  I was looking in my 
how-to-restore-bug-and-transporter book (great book, BTW), and it had 
pictures of sheet metal to cover almost the whole underside of the 
kombi.  Da belly-pan only covers the area underneath the driver's feet.  
So, are we referring to the same sheet?  (metal, that is)
