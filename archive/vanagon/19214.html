Greetings folks,

Well, Bradley called me up at about 4:30 PT to ask if the GNATT
tour could stop there.  I hesitated a bit thinking about the pig-
sty.  Then I decided I couldn't let my friends down and said they
could.  This conversation was kinda interesting as he was conversing
with Martha's cellular which was a bit noisy.  He was also talking
with David S. on an FM two-way and I was hearing Schwarzemiester
instructing Bradley on some thing to ask me as well as some other
smart-ass things to say. ;)  I gave them instructions to my place
and also Thom Fitzpatrick's number so they could call him to let
them know they were in town.

So I snuck out a little early and headed home as they said they
would be there in 1/2 hour.  What! Bradley and Martha at my house
without me there!  (images of burning possession going through my
mind).  ;)  

When I arrived home, they hadn't gotten there (thank goodness).  So 
I started picking up a bit.  About 5 - 10 minutes later they were
pulling into the court, so I went out to great them.  After a few
parking instructions we all said hi and I was introduced to David's
lovely lady Shelly (sp?) and we all headed inside except Marth who
is still trying to figure out how a Vanagon door opens and closes. ;)

They brought in all kinds of goodies for dinner: tamale (casarole?),
a rice dish (from Bradley's Prune recipe book), some large pretzels,
bread, grapes, and some pickled figs that Martha wanted us to try.

Well the eating/drinking commenced and Martha made a bee line for
the shower.  Meanwhile the rest all noticed my exclusive VT220 dumb
terminal and decended on it with Bradley logging on to his account
via Netcom.  There was some discussion about the trip and who David
and Shelley met with and how Joel snuck up on David while he (David)
was on the phone.  I gather that Joel was acting like a vagrant or
a drunk and David was getting pissed and then Joel let his identity
be known.  :)  Nice job Joel!

Speaking of Joel, he gave us a call and chatted with everyone on the
phone as it was passed around the room.

Bradley and Martha kept askin' if they could burn an engine case
in my fireplace or in the middle of the room.  NO!

We had a fine meal and Linda didn't bite my head off for having
people over when the house was a mess.  :]

A while later Thom and Amy made it over in their '56 van so David
and Shelley got a look see at it.  We also admired David's nifty
Porsche seat job.

Everyone got a shower in so I guess the hot water held up.

Martha, Linda and I got plates for Thom and Amy and put all the
fixin's on them.  Martha snuck a fig onto each plate and when
she noticed that Thom's was no longer on his plate, she asked
how he liked the fig?, the look on Thoms face was the most hila-
reous thing I've ever seen.  You just had to be there.  I knew
where that figs and it wasn't in his mouth or stomach.  I just
made sure to ask him if it was proper destroyed.  That's when
Linda showed him where the switch to the garbage disposal was. :)

Oh, and when I heated up Amy's plate in the microwave, the fig
and grapes were still on it....   oops!

Well, there was alot of talk about computer/network system commands
and routines and how to get around things.  Thom explained his
dismissal from TransA. and why he hadn't reeked havoc on the
place.  All in all, I think he made out quite well.

I was thinking they were going to stay the night, but then someone
decided to ask if they should head on toward Yosemite.  This is
at 10:00PM mind you.  So this went back and forth with Linda and I
telling them they were more than welcome to stay, but they insisted
that the tour had to move on.  So they picked up most of there belongings
and slowly headed out.  (Bradley's tupperware will be returned!)  
There's nothing like the sound of VW's starting up in the late evening
inside a residential court.  It was beautiful!  

Well I haven't heard anything from them since they left.  I hope they
got down there okay.  Please post if anyone hears anything.

Cheers!
