Subject: westphalia

I have a 1991 Vanagon Westphalia which we bought brand new.  I don't 
know who you are and I am new to the net, so if this questions is 
&quot;out-of-bounds&quot; for some &quot;netiquette&quot; reason, please ignore and 
excuse.  THANKS!  I have a rattle, a MAJOR rattle that comes from 
somewhere around the kitchen cabinet.  I have taken out all the 
shelves and checked everything I can.  There isn't anything loose.  It 
sounds like a piece of metal knocking against something.  I am afraid 
it might be a loose gas pipe or something dangerous.  My regular 
mechanic gave up right away.  I thought it might be nice to find out 
if some other owner had had the same problem and what they did.  Again 
if this is not the correct venue, please ignore.  Thanks much, Robert 
Clark (misterc_at_chattanooga_dot_net)
