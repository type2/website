Subject: RE: 12 volt heaters?


&gt;I saw a tiny heater that plugged in the cigarette lighter (which isn't
&gt;used for cigarettes by anybody I can think of). Anyone know if these
&gt;work? Just to make a warm patch for the feet?


Should work fine, for those of you who drive with your feet on the dash.  :)

Happy Friday!
