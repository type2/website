Subject: '54 RHD Deluxe Progress

Well, after a 3-week hiatus, I have re-commenced work on the barndoor.  I've
been slowed down a bit by our recent cold snap...

Anyway, I finally got the huge chunk of steel I-beam that was my passenger
side rocker cut off, and pulled the cargo doors off, too.  The hinge screws
are munched, probably beyond repair.  I can see that someone before me tried
heat and a screwdriver, and then left it to rust even worse.  I'll probably
have to section in new hinge sections :(

I have some pix of the progress that I'll put up on my web page when I get a
chance...
