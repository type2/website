                      RE&gt;Lug wrenches                              8/24/95

For years I have put a small dab of a lead based high temperature anti sieze
compund on all my tire lug threads.  I have NEVER had a lug that wouldn't
&quot;break&quot; free with the stock lug wrench and never had one come loose
unintentionally either.
