Subject: Questions about Naval Jelly


The subject of naval jelly pops up here occaisionally, and I pretty much
skip over the letters thinking that I know everything I need to know about
the stuff, but not enough to actually help the person posting.  But now I
have decided that I need to know more.  

Firstly, from what I understand, naval jelly chemically bonds to iron oxide
creating a shell which prevents further rusting. Am I correct on this, or is
it a very nice dream?

Socondly, If I am correct correct above, how does the new formed material
react to extreme heat?  Is naval jellying your exhaust crossovers a good idea?
Outside only or inside and out?


Thanks in advance for any light that you can shed on the subject.  Sorry I
didn't read the previous threads on the subject well enough.

Cheers,
SStones.

Ob-fridayFunly,  When is the best time for harvesting Navel Jelly?  I've dug
about in my belly button for the past month trying to get enough to de-rust
my '85, but all I ever get is the lint that I suppose you're supposed to
scrub it on with.
