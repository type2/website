Subject: Re: California Emissions...

Leave it to Rusty to obsrve the obvious but will someone please remind me
why EVERY Californian is moving to Arizona and Colorado? 

I absolutely do not intend to insult any past or present Californians
(Except Nixon) but to sympathize with the eternal crud that they are
subjected to. Add Smog Certificates to the other disasters. BTW have you
ever checked on the tasty surcharge involved in bringing a vehicle into and
registering it in CA? 

Let's please not start a thread on slamming Californians...
