&gt;hmmm. food for thought. especially since all the buses are shaped like
&gt;boxes. and the first three generations had a &quot;boxer&quot; engine (flat,
&gt;horizontally-opposed cylinders ... even Bill's Porsche engine fits. :)
&gt;
&gt;maybe BoxKar?         Boxer?  Boxer-Shorts?
&gt;      BoxKinder?
&gt;
&gt;and, of course, if buses were considered &quot;light&quot;, as in made-of-aluminum,
&gt;why then we'd be   &quot;Boxites&quot;. :)  &lt;groan&gt;

So if we adopt the Boxer name, and there's a revolution amongst VW Bus
drivers, would that be a Boxer Rebellion?
