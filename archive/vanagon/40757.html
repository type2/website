Subject: Bus vs. Bug generators

I am looking for a rebuilt generator for my '71 bus.  The books say I 
need the ....17x version which is 3/8&quot; longer than the ....15x.  The 
15x is widely available for about $55 rebuilt.  The cheapest I can 
find the 17x is about $110.  Unless this is wrong or there is a way to
get the 15x to work in my bus I am going to spring for the alternator 
kit and be done with it.  Also, would like to hear of sources for $55 
rebuilt 17x generators.

Maybe I should have asked this question first.  When I installed the  
engine this generator had a small amount of play in the bearings.  It 
works fine, makes no strange noises, etc.  How much longer can I 
expect this one to keep working?  Thanks, Jim
