There are two ways to tackle this question of an edited volume: one way
would be to use that information already available on the FAQs and
archives. This procedures simply requires allocation of work according to
subheadings, which all of us would decide on beforehand. The individual would
then download the pertinent information,
organize it coherently and embellish if necessary. This process requires
little technical knowledge on the part of the co-editor in the sense that
they need no know the nuances and detail but do have a sense of the
overall picture and argument they are trying to present. What would be
required is an ability to download the information and process it into to
2-5 page format (double-spaced). We could easily cover 30 topics of this
nature. More specific information  such as how to change your cv joints
(as opposed to problem shooting) could make up the remainder of the
volume; additional information  could consist of  travel information,
tavel experiences and advice, travel essentials, porsche conversions etc (in
other words all those
particularities that make this list distinct- such as Thom's rebuild job).

The second approach is to pre-assign tasks and have individuals submit
&quot;papers&quot; on a specific topic just as we did in university, and for the same
reason, the quality will vary due to specific skills that each of us have.
This kind of appraoch will require two or more &quot;editors in chief&quot; who can
collate, correct and disseminate the information. The first approach is
non-hierachical and segmented (bee-like); while the latter is pyramidal
and hierachical in structure requiring more work of two or three people
rather than many......DC
