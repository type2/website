Subject: clutch cylinder - help

How far should the clutch lever move when the clutch is pressed all the way in?

When is it time to rebuild/replace my clutch cylinders?  Any sure signs?  I
have had problems with my clutch since the dealer first replaced it. . .

One thing that bugs me is the &quot;linkage&quot; between the clutch slave cylinder
and the clutch lever seems to be missing.  It was never complete since I
have owned the van.  It was kind of home rigged, and I don't know what the
real setup looks like.  Pictures in the Bentley are pretty vague.  All
there is now is a steel rod pushing on the ball on the clutch lever.  I
don't have another van around to look at nor do I know anyone else that
owns one for me to get an idea from.

Any help would be appreciated, thanks already.
