Hello,
	My striping along the side of my 84 is getting a little old and is
starting to peel up and become brittle.  Consequently, when it peels up
and becomes brittle, it also chips off and looks bad.  Has anyone here
removed their stripping and replaced it?  I'm worried about cost so I
might just remove it and replace the stripes later.  I removed the stripes
on an old rabbit I had and it took me forever to remove all the gunk that
held the stripes on.  If someone knows of a better way it will undoubtably
save me buckets o' time.

Thanks,

Alan
