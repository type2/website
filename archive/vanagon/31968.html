Subject: Re: flaky fuel gauge

&gt;My '75 Westy has a sick fuel gauge - it never registers more than 1/2 a tank
&gt;and I can bottom out on &quot;reserve&quot;and still have half a tank left... obviously
&gt;this makes for high tension on any lengthy road trips!  Also, I can watch the
&gt;needle fluctuate from 1/2 to 1/4 to &quot;R&quot; and back - it doesn't matter whether
&gt;I'm on level ground, uphill, downhill, accelerating or decelerating - that
&gt;needle jumps all over da place!  Now I suppose that it's the float thingy
&gt;inside the gas tank which is to blame, but I'm posting this in the hope that
&gt;there's a way to determine what the problem is *without* dropping the engine
&gt;to remove the tank for inspection/cleaning/whatever... 
&gt;Any ideas out there?  Or must I remain  &quot;Have gas can, Will travel&quot;?

My '79 may have a similar problem if not as bad -- I fill it up to
overflowing and it only registers about 3/4 full.  It also seems to get down
to &quot;R&quot; too fast -- maybe it's a false reading.  My mech suggested that
instead of taking out the whole engine to replace the sensor (if you decide
to do that), you can cut a hole thru the metal directly above where the
sensor is located (going from a guidebook I guess?), making a little metal
flap that you can lift and shut again.  When you cover it with a mat you
won't notice the flap at all.  If you've recently bought the bus, check back
there and see -- maybe the p.o. already did this (as on mine.)
