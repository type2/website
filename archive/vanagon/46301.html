Subject: Re: VW Customer Relations &amp; reality check

     &gt;A while back I wrote to VW asking them about the possibility of
     &gt;re-introducing Westfalia vans in the US market. Here is the response 
     &gt;that I just received. They apparently think that there is no demands 
     &gt;for these vans here. I wonder if there is a way to convince VW that 
     &gt;there still is a decent demnad for Westfalias in US.
     
     
     If Volkswagen can bring back the Beetle, they can also bring back the 
     Vanagon or Bus.
     
     Call it the Concept 2.
