&gt; 
&gt; Just a quick note on 'swapping sides' for the benefit of CV joints. 
&gt; Remember, if you swap sides, ie take the left axle and put it on the
&gt; right, you've gained nothing.  One needs to swap ENDS of the
&gt; axle,with it remaining on the same side.  It does work BTW, if the CV 
&gt; joints are just border-line.  If they are trashed, buy new ones.
&gt; 
&gt; 
  I don't agree. Following the flow of torque from the transmission to the
  wheel: The CV ring drives the CV hub, the torque is carried down the axle
  to the CV hub which drives the CV ring. If you swap end for end you get 
  *exactly* the same relationship and because the &quot;driven&quot; end is now the
  &quot;driving&quot; end the loads are on the same faces of the joint. Moving them 
  from left to right reverses torque flow through the axle assembly and 
  the driving load passes through the faces that were previosly used when
  coasting. Hope I have all this right.

  Joel, you've actually swapped them, right? What did you figger?
