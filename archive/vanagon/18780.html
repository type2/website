Subject: folding table

someone had asked yesterday about a source for a folding camping
table, and last night a new Campmor catalog arrived, on page 42
is a nifty looking &quot;Roll-A-Table&quot;:

Convenient table for any outdoor adventure. Top is made of strong wood slats
that are hinged inside waterproof fabric. Gear pouch provides a practical place
to store cooking utensils and gear when table is set up and holds frame
securely inside the table when it is rolled up. Tubular aluminum legs screw on
in seconds. Seats four. Opens to 32&quot; square, 28&quot; high. Folds to 32&quot; x 6&quot;.
Weight 11 lbs. Item No. 41197-D $35.99

Campmor's number is 800 230 2151 and the catalog is a lot of fun to look
through, many useful items.
