Subject: Transmission swap

Stuart Hutton reminded me, when he mentioned that his smoking Vanagon
was popping out of gear.  I did a trans swap last summer on one of my
Vanagon diesels.

I was originally told, that the diesel has a unique transmission.  That
was false.  I found and used, a trans from a 1981 air cooled Vanagon.
All I changed was a bell housing and the input shaft.

It worked
