Subject: PopTop Seal Deal **IMPORTANT INFO!!**  (&amp; Last Call)

Listfolk,

I just learned something new and important about these poptop seals. The 
West Coast Metric version is custom made, and just SLIGHTLY different from, 
and better than, all the other poptop seals (McMasterCarr, JCWhitney, 
BusBoys etc.).  There are two differences.  One is the location of the 
rubber insulation bulb, which is  slightly lower on the WCM seal (and 
closer to original VW spec).  The other is that the WCM seal is 1/8&quot; taller 
than the other seals.  I went out and measured both an '85 and a '76 
poptop, and sure enough, the WCM size is just slightly truer to the 
original VW seal.  (I don't know why John Anderson's WCM sample was the 
same as the other brands, but my guess is that WCM has changed their 
design.  In any event, this current WCM design is, in fact, slightly closer 
to OEM.)

My supplier says they can provide me with a seal that matches this better 
WCM spec, but still has the more correct OEM-style smooth finish, unlike 
the WCM seal.  This will be better than the Whitney/McMasterCarr (and I 
guess old-style WCM) seal that I spoke about before.

It's going to cost me an extra $2.50 a set, but that's not a big difference 
and I think it's worth it for the best possible quality.

I'm going to order these better seals. If you've already sent me a check, 
or simply don't want to pay an extra $2.50, then that's perfectly okay.
I said $35.50 originally, and will honor that quote.  (You will receive the 
better seal anyway.)  But if you haven't mailed the check yet, and wouldn't 
mind paying the additional $2.50, that would be much appreciated. 
  
The order will go in on Monday, and the seals will be here about a week or 
ten days later, so it'll still be a couple of weeks before you get them. I 
will order a few extra, but not many, so if you'd like to add your name to 
the list, please e-mail me before the end of the weekend.

Thanks,
Ron Salmon

p.s. If you asked for seals, and do not receive a copy of this note 
directly to your e-mail address, then I never got your request.  Please 
e-mail me again. 



&gt;I got more than enough list response from the $35.50 poptop seal offer to 
&gt;go ahead with it.  If anybody else wants them, let me know.  I will 
&gt;probably order them Monday, so there's still a little time.  

&gt;Again, this is the complete set of seals for the Westfalia poptop, 
&gt;including both the pop-up and luggage rack sections. Just to repeat, since 
&gt;a couple of people asked, the seals cover the three sides where the top 
&gt;meets the side of the Westy.  The top seal (that goes horizontally across 
&gt;the roof) is NOT included (although that seal rarely goes bad anyway). 

&gt;Also, if you e-mail me, please include the year of your Westy, and your 
&gt;ZIP code (so I can let you know shipping costs).
