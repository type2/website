Subject: New web page

Greetings all,
  I recently scanned in a bunch (87!) of Vanagon/Bus photos for an addition
to Skip's web page and wanted to know what kind of images you guys would like
to see.  The only older stuff is a bunch of images taken from a '66 Westfalia
brochure; the rest are all Vanagon related.  I have a shot of Oettinger's
WBX6 6-cyl. wasserboxer, some shots of Projekt Zwo's modified Vanagons
(Single/Double cab, Serious off-road Syncro Kombi), Kamei Eurovan, my '84
(will be posted regardless&lt;g&gt;), Color Syncro cutaway, Westy interior shots
and various other things copied from my brochure collection.  Let me know,
and I should have them posted within a week.

Thanks,
Ryan
