Subject: Re: Cops buses and profiles


&gt; 
&gt; The UHP has had a lot of success with profiles 
&gt; &gt; in catching drug runners on I-15 and I-70 but is taking a lot of heat 
&gt; &gt; from the ACLU for it.  Someone out there has a signature block that 
&gt; &gt; says something along the line of if &quot;a nation that sacrifices freedom 
&gt; &gt; for security achieves neither&quot;.  Amen brother.

&gt;     To live outside the law, you must be honest.
I believe the signature you are looking for is below.
