Subject: Re: '88 lurching at 2500-3000 rpm

In a message dated 96-03-08 19:20:15 EST, you write:

&gt;Drove the new baby to work today - first time in some traffic - and 
&gt;noticed some lurching in 2nd &amp; 3rd gear at around 2500-3000 rpm. ie: 
&gt;trying maintain a steady speed in slow traffic would result in a 
&gt;surging or lurching motion. Accelerate to a little over 3000 &amp; it 
&gt;would mostly go away.
&gt;It seems to be related to part throttle power delivery - ie: 3/4 or 
&gt;more accel to 4000 in each gear is smooth, but a &quot;lazy&quot; foot with 1/2 
&gt;throttle or so causes a similar lurching during accel.
&gt;
&gt;
Check the throttle valve switch.  It can be adjusted as discribed in Bently.
 I had a similiar problem with my 87' syncro.  My switch was shot and needed
to be replaced.  This solved the problem.  It's worth a look.
