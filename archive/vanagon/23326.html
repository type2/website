Subject: Air filter box and pipe

When I first started this listserv I asked if anyone had a spare of the 
big plastic box that holds the air filter.  Mine's cracked where the 
fresh air pipe goes into it and it's all duct taped together.  Would 
anyone out there have one of those or know of a junkyard where they could 
get one? I'd pay a reasonable price plus shipping, but I'm not going to 
pay the over $100 that VW wants for one.

Thanks for any leads!
