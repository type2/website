Subject: Re: question about van shopping

Good luck finding your vanagon!
My folks live up north of Seattle in Mt. Vernon.
I plan to drive my van up that way this Spring/early Summer
and sell it.  However, my van is a 1978 and may not feel new
enough to you, no AC etc... Make sure you hang in there until
you find a one owner, if you can.  It has made the difference
in my relationship with my van.  I got it cherry from a one
owner of 11 years, hard copy records of all maintenance from
the same shop.  If your patient, you'll be pleased and probably
fall in love with your van.  Blah, blah, blah.
Take care, dave's not here man.
