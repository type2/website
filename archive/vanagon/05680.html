Wow!  Thanks for all the good advice.  This is sure a hell of a lot
friendlier than rec.bicycles.*

Regarding the valves &amp; oil.  I'm running 20/50 weight oil.  And yes,
the exhaust fumes seem to be pretty oily (putting your hand in front
of the pipe will get you a dalmation look RSN).  Until I can get it
fixed, I drive it as little as possible (to save the engine and
the air).  I'm getting 16.5-17.5mpg, and estimate I'm adding a quart
of oil every 250-350 miles.  BTW, what's up with those dipsticks?
Is it me, or are they nearly impossible to read?  What's really weird
is that after a lube/oil/filter job, the stick will still read low
at times (like the oil is taking forever to &quot;migrate&quot;).  One of the
VW &quot;mechanics&quot; (read: parasitic vultures) did mention that compression
was off by more than 10%, but of course, didn't write ANYthing down.
Enough venting on that matter...

I'm not sure about the bed mods.  If I do that, I won't be able to
lock the bike inside.  NO kinky replies about sleeping with the bike,
OK? ;-)  Seriously, the bike is worth much more than the car, so I'd
rather sleep in a tent than lose the bike (or part of it).

Even with all the car's problems, it's an absolute gas to drive.  My
wife has a Mazda MPV, but the oldest daughter (almost 6) just loves
taking my car to the store (with me driving, of course).  Even the
wife admits to have a certain fondness for the beast.  She only wishes
I had it when we were dating. ;-)

Next time I buy a car (read: another Vanagon or Bus), I'll pay a bit
more attention to the mechanics than the comely lass selling me the
car.

Many thanks.
