&lt;&lt;... I'm selling this van (don't ask me why, its killing me) to a fellow
listmember.  He's coming tomorrow to get it.  I'm going to miss
it...The thought occured to me as I was cleaning it out, that unlike
_any_ other car I've ever had, its impossible to lose a french fry under
the seat of a vanagon (at least in the camper).  I'm going to miss
that...&gt;&gt;

   You've obviously overlooked the &quot;Dreaded Dropped Screw Zone&quot;, that
space between the Westy cabinets and the part of the seat frame the brain
is mounted onto.  The PO's kids lost all sorts of small objects that
remain in there to this day.  So far, nothing of mine has
disappeared...yet
