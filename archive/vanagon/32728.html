Subject: Got my Jacobs Bug Pak today...(!)

Yes, it's Friday.  Last Friday, I ordered my Jacobs Bug Pak, and it just
got here today as the sun was setting.

Although you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, I must say the Jacobs
packaging was impressive.  As I am a graphic designer, I appreciate it when
a company makes neccesary effort to present their product professionally.
(All too often I tire of the Commodore-64 instruction packet ever so
present in the mail order here's my product business.)

I was also impressed by the manufacture of the product--it is obviously
heavy duty and looks nice n' solid.  The wire harnesses are all labeled for
easy installation and the instructions are thourough and easy to follow.

Anxious to install this (see below) I am currently debating going outside
right now, especially considering this weeks X-files episode is a repeat...

One thing I _was_ sort of dissapointed with is Jacobs sales and shipping team...
When I called Friday the salesperson was not very informative and was just
into high pressure sales tactics(&quot;...would you like to put that on Visa or
Mastercard?&quot;--like hey, I didn't say I'd buy it yet!) and as Jacobs is in
Texas, I was hoping to get product to me by Wednesday (salesman said would
get here in a few days). When I called Thursday to find out where it was,
customer service told me they just shipped it on Wednesday!  Like what's
the hold up, fellas?

With all that aside, I'm hoping installation will be a success.  I am
taking photos and will have all the scoop avaiable to you here on the lists
and at my webscene Volksaddict (http://www.io_dot_com/~johnny89/Volksaddict).

Enjoy your weekend everybody!

Johnny
