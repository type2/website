Subject: Weber DFEV's and heat
Date: Fri, 30 Jun 1995 14:39:05 -0500 (CDT)

I had asked about the Weber Progressive DFEV carb and got mostly 
positive responses.  It seems that some electrical part of the carb 
hits the fan housing but can be fixed.  One person had theirs running 
rich but expected to fix that with a jet change.  So, I think I have 
decided to go this way and save some money and headaches over duals.  
I have one more question first:  How does one provide heat to this 
carb to keep it from icing?  I know some setups use your stock 
oil-bath air cleaner.  Does this one?  It will be replacing the 
34PICT3 on a 1600DP in a '71 bus.  Thanks, Jim
