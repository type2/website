&gt;(I believe the ceiling has a foam coating and the velcro strip is nylon(?)

At Joel Walker's suggestion, I used 3M Fast Tack Trim Adhesive, which seems
to have worked well.  It's specially made for auto trim, and I got a tube
at Orchard Supply Hardware.  You may also wish to pick up a cheapo brush to
apply the adhesive with.  I got it all over my fingers, and regretted it
for a week.
