Subject: Vanagon sighting

Hi all-
        I got the most monster wave from a guy in a vanagon today.  I was 
wondering if it could have been the other person at tech who is currently 
vanagon shopping.  Anyway, it was the first wave I have gotten from anyone 
in a vanagon.  Me thinks that the vanagon owners are snobby around here.

See ya.
