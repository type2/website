&gt; Hi California people,
&gt; 
&gt; My request is pretty simple. I'm trying to get hold of a CA state sticker.
&gt; You know the type you stick in your rear windshield to tell people where
&gt; you come from (as well as your plates).

Hmmm... never seen one of those... at least not the oval type like the
country stickers.  Just big, gaudy, red-and-blue-and-purple reflective
ones with pictures of Sea World on them.  Or Redwoods.  You probably
wouldn't want those.  :)

&gt; I've got a fair collection European oval stickers like: D,A,CH,F,L,GB.

I just have the big &quot;D&quot; on mine.  :)

&gt; Come to think of it, I'm interested in anything California for my Cal theme
&gt; Bus.

If you want to go that route, you should get those chrome headlight shades,
Porsche wheels, wide tires (oops, tyres), and lower the bus a coupla
inches.  Naaaahhhh...

-David
