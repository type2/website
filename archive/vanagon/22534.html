Subject: Re:  Hitch survey for '68-'71 bus



&gt;I have two types of hitches. One is a cross bar that replaces the rear 
bumper
&gt;and has a hitch on it, attaching to the bumper mounts. It reminds me of the
&gt;old &quot;loser jokes.&quot; A loser is a bus owner who trys to pull something with a
&gt;hitch attced to bumper mounts. I know--nuff said. The other came on the
&gt;campmobile. It attachs to the frame behind where the rear motor mount bar
&gt;attaches. Now that is a hitch. As to the bumber mounts, take a close look 
at
&gt;them, the are esentially welded on, belive me, I had occasion to have a 
mount
&gt;welded on--nuff said.

Actually, Tim, I had a '69 Bus in Colorado, with (I think) a
custom-made hitch that bolted only to the rear bumper mounts, as you
describe. I towed EVERYTHING with it, including a '72 bus that
weighed more than the '69 doing the towing. Mind you, I don't
recommend this-- I was young and foolish, and certainly exceeding
whatever ratings that thing had. (It was fun, tho!)

Point is, all the stress was falling directly on those bumper
mounts, which never creaked, shifted, or complained an iota, despite
all that abuse. These things aren't weak! At least, not on that
particular bus.

'Course, if yours are rusty, or have been tagged in an accident,
all bets are off.

Wish I still had that bolt-on hitch, tho...
