So martha rubin says:
&gt; OK, there seems to be a STRONG sentiment to avoid the mountains and
&gt; snow in winter for this trip.  I've reread the 20+ responses on
&gt; this matter and there's been a noticeable tendency to prefer the
&gt; CA coast.  I rather like David Garth's suggestion of the Pfeifer
&gt; Big Sur State Park, since, as he puts it, it should be warmer
&gt; relatively speaking, and &quot;has it all:&quot;  redwoods, waterfalls,
&gt; river, ocean.  (David, it had BETTER have showers!  :).  Anyway,
&gt; in the spirit of democracy, I suggest we do go with the majority's
&gt; wish to stay on the coast, and mid-state seems fair when I look
&gt; at the stats, considering the number of people all over the state, plus
&gt; additional states to the south, and to the north.  

I have a CA State Park map right in front of me and it doesn't specify
showers but that doesn't mean anything according to my wife (Linda)
who works for the Parks department (and is rooting for showers too ;) ).
However, the phone number for Pfeifer BS State Park is (408)667-2315 
and I'm sure they can tell you whether or not you can be clean or go 
stinky. ;)  To reserve sites you need to call the Mistix number for 
reservations: 1(800)444-7275.  

The Park is 26 miles south of Carmel on Hwy 1.  821 acres. 215' 
elevation.  Motel-type cabins for rent.  217 developed sites; 
trailers 24', campers 27'.

The key for what's there indicates: family campsites with special
sites for bikers (bicycles), picnic tables, fishing, hiking trails, 
swimming, nature trail(s), exhibits, food service, supplies, trailer
sanitation sites.

You can try calling them (the park) today.  Linda says there may be 
someone there.

Cheers!

Steven
