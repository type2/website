Subject: trip logs, Legal now, ECI, RIP? Stickers

	Bob,
	I think you're right, a vocal minority can strongly affect
a nearly-instantanious public forum like this one. I've been consistantly
impressed by the civility of this list, which I think comes from
the people the list attracts (second order effect) rather than
the topic.
	I'd also say this list has a very high value- I save several
items a week, have made friends here, etc. We don't agree on 
lots of things that don't have to do with the topic, VW Busses. We
don't HAVE to agree if we can remain civil.

	All,
	My appointment with DMV came around and I went in to
get the temporary license for Little Martha (I'm getting married
April 7 so I need some more stuff do to :) ) Paperwork in hand,
I couldn't help myself from going straight home, putting the temp
on the back window, putting a vanagon.lenti sticker on the lower 
left corner of the back window and getting on the road! Drove
my first 13 legal miles, engine running strong, abundant power,
brakes working ok, steering stiff but accurate.
	Now if I can just pass smog and the inspection next week...

	Oh yes, I mailed in the ECI warranty card when I finally
finished the installation and drove the vehicle the first time. Card
came back, ECI isn't there any more. So much for my warranty :) I guess
I'll try Stephens next time, if I ever run up enough miles for a next
time. GEX are probably ok but that bikini model... cute, but not what 
I'm looking for when I buy a rebuild. DB&amp;HVW hasn't got any ads from
ECI either- guess they're gone.

	Its a TOTAL TREAT to drive my ol' bay window, especially knowing
how much of it's servicability is the result of my and friend's efforts.

	I put the Canadian flag sticker Crista and Tobin gave me at
Pfeifer in '95 right next to the vanagon list sticker. I've got a nice
USA flag sticker too. What I need is a small Netherlands sticker
(for the bellybox locks Brian Verbeek bought for me) and a Brazilian
Mexican and German flag for major parts sources.

	Or should that be Netherlands, UK, Ireland, Oz and South
Africa for locations of list members? :)

	Does anyone have an idea where to get small national flag
stickers? Tobin, Crista, where did you get that roll of little 'zaps'
you were giving out? (Military aircraft landing at a foriegn base
are frequently 'zapped' with a national or humorous marking
from the host country.)

	Bill, his wannabusser days gone forever.
	I can't stop smiling!
