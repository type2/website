Subject: RE: RE: 89 syncro, binds in tight turning

My recollection is that my diff-lock-off experience is like your
diff-lock-on experience.  I have not had to engage the diff lock at all
since I bought the van last spring, tested it, and at that time the diff
lock worked in sync w/ the dash light; &quot;on&quot; means engaged.  Perhaps I'm on
the verge of some drive train failure.

&gt; toward the stops, which I always thought was due to the expanded 
&gt; footprint of the oversize tires. Other than that, nice smooth circles.
&gt; 
&gt; Diff lock on: Shudders, enough that I did not want to keep on doing 
&gt; this to the vehicle. Shuddering definately decreases as I approach 
&gt; straight line. No visible tire scuffs  on the asphalt, but it is
&gt; not a dry surface.
