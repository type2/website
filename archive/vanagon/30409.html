Subject: THIS weekend- YAYYY


	Friends,
	This is the big weekend, and I'll be away from my computer, so
wish me luck! Thanks for all the support so far, everyone. We're starting
at 8:00 tomorrow and will knock-off around 5, same Sunday. I can't
see how we'll miss getting the engine installed and running by then,
but like they say, if you want to make God laugh, tell 'em your plans. :)

	Pizza will be sent for at 6:00 or so Sunday. Bradley's going
to be there, and checked that beer would be available ;) 

	I think mostly what I have to do is wiring, and that shouldn't
be too bad.

	Cheers, all!

	Bill, soon to be a '70 single-cab driver :)
