Or like all the idiots who go behind the wheel of early 911's and lit
up the back end in the first corner they came to - D'oh!  
Or same idiots who went charging into a corner too fast and slammed on
the brakes - Double D'oh!

Its easy to push the envelope on ANY car.  It gets futile trying to 
protect the driver from himself.  I think the biggest problem is people
get comfortable with their car, and stop paying attention to what their
doing, and then their not prepared when it hits the fan.

Example - how many land yachts have you seen with the guy driving slumped
down in the seat, driving with just his (her) wrist flopped over the wheel?
