Subject: China-made tool question/ Harbor Frt.

I would like help in clarifying the country of manufacture for 
several tool brands featured in the Harbor Freight tool catalog.  I 
wish to avoid tools made in China when buying sight unseen via the 
mail.  so....

If you can verify the country of manufacture for the following i will 
summarize them and repost.  Additionally, add to the list if you 
like, giving comments on the product quality.

Cen-Tech
Central Pnuematic
Central Machine
Central Electric
Pittsburg
Chicago Electric
Central Tool

others??
