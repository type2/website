Subject: Re:  where does it go?!?

might have been breathing in too much second hand drugs, but my recollection
is if you look at the door design there is a vent in the back of the door that is
on the outside of the door gasket , thus when the vents are open the air in the
car can get pulled out through the door vents, through the door until it is free
at last on the outside. if i put my hand down there and then slide the
vent back and forth i can feel the suction (how do i get my hands doing all
those things at once - all that practice polishing chess pieces
(if thats not a gauntlet for Ric i dont know what is ...)

sps
