Subject: RE: Speaking of heater fans...

Todd Schroeder asks about the fans that go in the heater duct.  I installed
the one that JCWhitney sells for $70, and although my van differs in two im-
portant respects from Todd's (it's a Vanagon, and it has two extra cylinders),
I would recommend the concept.  In summary, it gives you the heat at idle and
around-town speeds that you would otherwise have only at cruising speeds.
Also slams heat farther up the windshield to defrost more.  The price you pay
(in addition to $70 and your labor) is NOISE.  If I did it again, I would
think seriously about installing it in the engine compartment to blow heated
air, rather than near the driver's feet, where it sucks.  So to speak.

Also note that the one sold for Vanagons is plastic and the instructions say
not for use with gas heaters.  I have not yet removed my gas heater, but I
have disconnected it and would sell it willingly: not needed in my situation,
down to teens or so ambient temps.
