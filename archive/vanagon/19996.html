I've just stripped the engine from my '71 bus, thought I'd get a gallon 
or two of solvent to put in the bug sprayer, and clean the daylights out 
of everything.  The only place I've found solvent by the gallon was $20 
bucks!!!  Ouch, and WalMart doesn't have it.  Perhaps there's something 
cheaper and almost as 
effective on grease, like Dawn dishwashing liquid?  This is probably OK 
on the shrouding, but how about the inside of the crankcase?  What are 
the tricks and tips on this type of cleaning job?  Also, is there a list 
of Mustdos While the Engines Out? 

I deeply appreciate the help I get from this list!  Working on the bus 
has certainly been more fun thanks to you generous gurus and others who 
ask the questions that I was also wondering about.
