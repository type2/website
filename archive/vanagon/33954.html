Subject: Re: Need advice on Westfalia purchase

In a message dated 96-01-28 00:48:47 EST, you write:

&gt;Are there any owners out there who could take the time to communicate
&gt;with us about various aspects of their campers
&gt;
&gt;Model years we are likely to be looking at are 89, 90 and 91. I don't
&gt;think we can manage a '92 on our budget.

I have an 85 Westy that I think is the best thing since sliced bread.  If I
was going to purchase another one, I would HIGHLY recommend the 91.  Of all
the years the water cooled Vanagon was made (83-92), the 91 and 92 seem to
have the most 'options' of all the models.  I would also highly recommend a
Syncro (all wheel drive).  

Some things to check before purchasing:

-engine compression
-look for oil and water leaks (especially from the heads with engine running)
-check oil pressure with engine at operating temp (you will probably need a
mechanic to do this since only an idiot light is OEM)
-condition of maintenance items (things you would normally replace on a
regular basis - ie., tires, air filter, fuel filter, spark plugs and wires,
distributer housing and rotor, brake pads and shoes, brake drums and discs).
 I wouldn't necessarily let these items prevent you from a purchase, but I
would take them into consideration when bargaining for a price or considering
to walk away from a particular van.  I used these items that were in need or
replacement within the next 6 months to bargain the price down from $4500 to
$3500 on my 85 Westy.  Through shopping around, I spent about $600 making the
needed maintenance improvments instead of $1000.  
-Hire a mechanic to inspect the vehicle before purchase.  Specifically have
him check for: crankshaft, camshaft, and piston bearing noises (indicating
the need for an engine rebuild); transmission condition; suspension wear (tie
rods, linkage, etc...); CV joint/boot condition; and Exhaust component
condition (they can get pretty pricey).

My 85 Westy handles GREAT in the snow.  I was extremely suprised in the
winter.  It handles and drives better than my wife's front-wheel drive 93
Honda Accord.  The only handling dificulties I have is with wind for obvious
reasons.  I even to my 1200 pound motorcycle on its trailer plus people and
gear without any problems.  I get 17 mpg in the city (I don't remember what I
get on the highway, but 22 comes to mind).  It is no race horse and I am
forced to drive defensively (to my wife's amusement).  I have just rebuilt
the engine on my van.  I plan on keeping this for a long time.  The only
things I wish I had are the extra accessories on the 91 and 92 versions
(cruise control, etc...) 

Good luck with your purchase!  Let us on the list know if you need more help.

-Gregg
85 Westy, 76 Goldwing, 51 Plymouth, 75 Mercedes ... need more toys!

BTW,
I wouldn't consider the VW dealor as your only source of parts and service.
 Many people (like me) steer away from dealorships because of high prices and
to many poor experiences with bad mechanics at the dealorship.  I would take
into consideration mail order parts houses and catalogs as well as a local
mechanic that understands vw's.  The key is a GOOD mechanic.
