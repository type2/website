saw a 68 camper in La Jolla recently w/ a pinto engine.  that's a 100hp
before any performance tweaks.  tough little motor.  i had a '73 2L run
(hard :-) ) to 145K before having to pull head first time.  actually fit
the '68 pretty well.  this conversion ran pipes up starboard side to
radiator on or in the nose (couldn't see the mounting specifics, was
covered with a bra).  looked like the guy had cut some holes in the deck
for maintenance access -- couldn't see why he needed them tho'.  seemed to
be plenty of room in there.

side note: relined rear brakes and fixed parking cables last week on my
85GL.  WOW!  a trip to have van w/ a functioning parking brake -- almost an
oxymoron.  :-)
gotta do front brakes this weekend.

see ya on the road,
