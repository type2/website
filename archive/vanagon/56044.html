Subject: Auxilliary battery, relays, installation

There's been so much talk about auxilliary battery installation and problems
with the relays and isolators et al, and different ways of installation.

I have a '91 Syncro Westy that I want to install one in, and also have
optional back-up charging from a photovoltaic panel.  I want to have the
fridge run on 12v only when the engine is running, and I want the camper
light and camper water pump to run off the aux battery, as well as my laptop
computer and possibly a cell phone and evaporative cooler.  And of course I
want both batteries to charge when the van is running.

My Bentley manual only goes to '89 and I'm wondering if the relays et al
have changed, and just how to go about this installation.

The only deep cycle battery I can find that will fit under the driver's seat
is 40 amp hours.  Do you know of others more powerful?  



Incidently, how long will the camper light run off the starter (&quot;regular&quot;)
battery?
