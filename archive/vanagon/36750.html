To All:

Two comments in conjunction with Harry's excellent coverage of the need for
periodically cleaning Westpalias:

It is not uncommon for rust to form under seemingly impervious layers of tar,
grease or even epoxy.  The best preventative measure appears to be periodic
inspection.

With regard to a Westy's interior, even in an otherwise rust-free vehicle you
will usually find some degree of rusting under the plywood floor, which
received no special treatment before the plywood was laid down.  As I have
said in early posts, when it comes to the cargo area, most vans appear to
rust from the inside out.  Spillage or even condensate will be absorbed by
the plywood and held in contact with the painted metal, eventually causing
rust.  By the time you notice the exterior rust, the damage can be extensive.
 Westpalia provides no special treatment for either the plywood floor or the
floor of the van.  Hindsight shows that both would benefit from such.
