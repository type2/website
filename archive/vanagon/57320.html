&gt; Hi Dave,
&gt; 
&gt; This getting more and more interesting! I agree we should approach this
as
&gt; a group to keep the price down, especially with this new information. Let
&gt; me know if you need any help. I'm in Cincinnati, Ohio, not too far from
&gt; Chatanooga.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;I live in Cahttanooga, TN, about 20 miles from these busses.  I have
&gt; &gt; &gt;talked with the man on the phone once, and he told me that he wanted
&gt; &gt; &gt;$450-$750 each.  The variation on price was determined by weather or
not
&gt; &gt; &gt;the motors and controlers and batteries were included.  I don't have
his
&gt; &gt; &gt;name or number here at work, but I do have it at home.  He told me
that
&gt; &gt; &gt;he WOULD sell them one at a time.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This price is MUCH more reasonable than what I was told.  I'm not
&gt; &gt; looking to make a dime on this deal, I just want one of the buses.
&gt; &gt; I don't care if I make the deal with the guy or someone else does,
&gt; &gt; but let's all try to do this collectively instead of everyone
&gt; &gt; giving the guy a flood of calls which will surely drive the price
&gt; &gt; up, when he suddenly thinks he is sitting a goldmine.
&gt; &gt;
