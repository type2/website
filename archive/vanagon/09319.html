&gt;   1)  $21k for a '93 EV GL is waaaaay too much to ask, nevermind pay, especially
&gt;       if it's got 18k miles on it.  Heck, I almost paid less than that for a
&gt;       fully optioned MV (but without Weekender poptop, auto.) brand new.
&gt;       Me?  I'd start at &lt;$15k and be ready to walk...

I second this opinion.  I paid $18,080.00 flat for my brand new '93
EV GL at the time I bought it -- no frills, just the two AC units
and the stereo.

There's a *loaded* '93 EV at the same dealer with 24,000 miles (automatic),
and their starting price is $18,000.00 -- they said they'd be flexible -- to me
that means they'll sell it for $15,500.00.

Tom, you might want to save your bucks for a trip to PA --
it looks pretty sharp.  If you want, give them a a call -- 610-797-6330.
