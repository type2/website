&gt;&gt;Tried to get a new boot for the spot where the shift rod connects to the
&gt;&gt;shift actuator on the transaxle.  On the '90 GL standard, this is a
&gt;&gt;two-pleat accordian shape that fits over the nylon ball on the actuator and
&gt;&gt;it changes into a cylindrical shape that fits over the body of the
&gt;&gt;&quot;receiver&quot; (inside of which the nylon ball resides).

&gt;I just purchased one of these from Camelback VW (800.876.5199).
&gt;251-711-167-E  $2.85

D'oh!
Yup - that number is molded into the piece that I still had (the
cylindrical part) - I noticed it while torqueing the CV joint bolts.

Is Camelback a local dealer, or can I get them to send one next-day?
Wouldn't that be nice - $20+ for a $3 part.

The answers have ranged from this one (correct for the '90) to &quot;no such
thing&quot;, which could very well be correct for another year-model.  My
(now-retired) guru says he's seen a lot of variations.

Thanks to everyone who responded.
