Listees,

  Just posting to the list to let everyone know I'm alive, well and I've
moved my office from home to the Shop(Volks Cafe).

  In the past, reaching me in a hurry or my e-mail response time had
been slower than I had wanted.  The new situation has created a medium
for me to be reached during normal business hours (8-5) every weekday.

  In the past I was hopping from shop to home and NOT being as efficient
as I wanted to be.  In the past I had to e-mail people and let them know
I had it but I needed to check the price and availibilty of the
peticular part. Now I just check stock and e-mail price and part # where
applicable and this will make it smoother for all the people I'm in
contact with.
