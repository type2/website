&gt;BTW, does anybody have any problems with bolts coming slack?  It seems that I
&gt;have to tighten them again after some use.

yup. :)  what i determined to work pretty well for me was to clean/fix/dodah
the joints, then drive for about 300-500 miles or so, then crawl back up
under the car and re-torque the bolts. i think the use of a torque wrench to
get 'close' to the right tension on the bolts is what helps. but there is
always at least one that is a little loose at 300-500 miles.

after that they don't seem to loosen any more.

i also tried to be really really really clean about the bolts and getting
all the grease out of the bolt holes and off the threads and all, and then
i got kinda lazy and just wiped it off, and it didn't seem to make any
difference. seems like a greasy thread ought NOT to hold as well, but it
holds just fine.

i sure wish i'd stayed awake in those physics and engineering classes. :(
