This is probably  true because the '93 EV (CL, GL, and MV w/w/o Weekender)
originally entered the market summer '92.  Since they're such hot sellers
in the US minivan market ;-) , VWoA is practically *firesale-ing* remaining
'93 EVs, then waiting for the '96 mod year to introduce the VR6 EV.

Asghar, Iowa can't be the hotbed of VW vandom; have you inquired else-
where about the availability of an MV w/Weekender option?  There
are still a few available out in this neck of the woods.  There are
also conversion alternatives that would cost less than the 
EV Winnie you test drove.
Good luck!
