Subject:      A cover for my Westy....

     List members:

     I've covered my Syncro Westy for the last several years with an old
     parachute.  I'd like to upgrade my cover.  The question is:

     1.  Who makes the best cover?

     2.  Where can I get one?

     I store my Syncro Westy from _at_ Dec. 1 thru Apl 1.  I run it weekly and
     would like to have a cover for both outside and inside use.

     Again, Thanks for the info

     Spev
