Subject: Re: Red Rock Canyon info - more

Ok, people, it looks like there's a big enough contigency to count
on Red Rock gathering March 24-26, 1995. 

Gerry has requested that we please not use terms like &quot;pretour w&quot;
or something like that in our subject headings, so that people searching
around in gopher, etc. will be able to distinguish our various
escapades.

Asap, I'll try to post (roast?) a list of people who've indicated
an interest in attending.  Am hoping that the southerly nature of
this locating will entice all of our S. CA bretheren, as well 
as some from Arizona, New Mexico, etc.  

If you're a wannabe(bus), or your van/bus is for some reason not
roadworthy at the time of this trip, join us anyway, and bring a 
tent.  Or with luck, David Schwarze will let you stay up all nite
in HIS van drinking beer and playing illegal games (cringing, 
ducking from David's wrath).

Join in the fun. 

Now!  Does anyone know the way to get reservations?  Thru Mistix?
If so, can someone please post the number.  As this is getting
really into spring and hopefully warmer weather, we encounter
some competition for spots.

Any ideas on potlucks?  I have some definite ones, but want to
hear all suggestions possible, and then will report.  

Bring sunscreen and sunglasses!

Can anyone tell me if this place is near a place called Sedona?
