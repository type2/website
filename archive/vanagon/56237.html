Subject: Kampers at Keyser Pond

Well, it's official... there will not be a Ben &amp; Jerrys Camping weekend

with the NHVWC Show and Swap.

This is a large well maintained private camping area.  We will be in one
or both of the Group areas they have availible ( depending on how many
folks show up...) There is Bingo on Friday night (put on by the
Campground) and a pot-luck supper sponsored by Limbo Saturday night

is sponsoring the First Annual LiMBO Mini-golf Tournament at the Keyser
Pond Miniature Golf Course. Under $2 each for 18 holes with Prizes for
both the top 3 Adults and top 3 Kids ( under 12). Events are open to All
