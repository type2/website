Subject: HELP engine problems on '81

Well planning vacation this year and since I'm not going to
get around to body work on the '78 and since I got a chance
at a real fridge.
   A couple quick questions to all you air cooled vanagon
people.  Sunday I am going to go get an '81, it is 5-6
hours from me at 60 mph.  Now current state is running
solid on 3 cylinders, No. 2 cylinder 0 compression.  Funny
thing is right side head recently overhauled? (though mechanic
quality questionable)  Well I've not been able to look at
the engine whatsoever, but I have from a spare '79 block
one good head, some good lifters, reuseable in a pinch P/C
if needed.  What I want to know is since I've never pulled
an air cooled van engine how long will this take me relative
to a wasserboxer or late air cooled bus?  Any pitfalls to
avoid?  Am I best to go ahead and drop engine and tranny as
a unit (I figure I am),  could instead I pull a head by merely
dismantaling tin on that side (and intake and exhasust) I don't
figure so but I'd like to not drop the engine due to where the
van sits.
   Finally as is anyone want to conjecture how far I could go, PO
drove it back 4 hours the way it is,  I'd like to make it
only 1.5-2 down to a friends, but really don't wan't to screw
it up too much worse, course I don't even know whats wrong.
I would guess a heavily pounded seat but that seems unlikely
in view it was off 5-10k back.  I will be rebuilding the engine
immediately anyway, but would always like to save a spare with as
little damage as possible.
   On this last 1 more quick question, any differences between the
'79 and '81 I don't think there are but something nags me about mounts
or something.

John
