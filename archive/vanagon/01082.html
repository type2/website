Subject: bosch alternators



hey, you know how the internally regulated bosch alternators
have the characteristic of &quot;coming on&quot; or producing power
only above a certain rpm when first started, well my 
question is: is the rpm at which the alternator clicks
on related to the conditon of the brushes or reg?
have any of you noticed that some alternators come on
at lower rpms, some at higher rpms?

just wonderin'

Alistair
