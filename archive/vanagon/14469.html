!!When you look up complete idiot in a dictionary, my picture is beside
_at__at_it.

Wouldn't that be a compleat idiot? (Muir joke) :)  
But a Muir-analysis is in order here.  Nice 'n slow, just like He says.  

Other potential factors:  your hoses.  Here in the desert SW, they dry 
out &amp; need replacing every 2-3 years.  Doubly so if your '71 has the 
power brakes (long hose going from front (FIF) of bus to left side of 
intake manifold.  A vacuum gauge could also help locate vacuum leaks, a 
potential source of problems.  

~Prior to this I've played around with all the settings, tried different
!distributors, even replaced the intake manifold (suspecting clogged heat
#riser).  The 24-year-old Solex turned out to be the demon, partly due to its
_at_age and partly its design making it susceptible to this problem.  Which 
$brings
%up my next point, don't bother rebuilding the 34.  Buy a new one if you 
^decide
&amp;to go this way.  $120.

*Like I said, after 9 mos. of frustration, I'm happy with mine now...

I strongly second the buy-new-34-pict advice.  The rebuilds often are 
problematic and may keep you hunting for the (wrong) problem.  I run a 
009 setup in my '70 Kombi (1600DP) with a new 34-pict.  Yeah, sure, 
there's the minor hesitation at 1st, but it really charges (hah!) after 
that. 

Good Luck!!
