Subject: Sliding door operation

Yesterday I got home (carpool) and needed to use the Van, so I went to 
slide open the sliding door (how I always get in -- it's just easier) and 
the door wouldn't open.  It was stuck.  I could close it, and I could 
move the lever, but all it would do was slide the back open a little 
ways.  After some investigation and dismantling, I discovered that the 
locking mechanism doesn't appear to be working right.  However, I'm not 
so sure what &quot;right&quot; is, so I'm asking any (or all)  of you to tell me how 
yours works.
The front latch mechanism has two parts, an upper and a lower.  The upper 
is rectangular, and the lower has a hook.
When the upper is pressed into the door, then the lower can raise a 
little to release from the strike plate. Now, here's the tricky part. 
When I move the door handle lever, the rear mechanism (remote control) 
operates and releases the back part of the door.  The front latch does 
nothing.  Can someone tell me what the front SHOULD do?  Does moving the 
lever pull the upper (rectangular) part of the latch BACK, or does it 
just push the hook up.  I can't imagine what might have broken here.

I think, since this unit is all sealed and I&quot;ve totally removed it and 
found nothing that I can see amiss, I'm going to have to replace it. 
Soooo, if anyone has one that they're willing to sell, please let me know.

Thanks.
