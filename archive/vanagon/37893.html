Well I took some time yesterday and got the bolt problem resolved 
somewhat...

The threads in the reduction box were pretty trashed, so I went to 
the local VW shop to get their opinion on what to do.

To show just what a bunch of weenies these guys are, and how they 
know there is no money in air-cooled VW's, and further proving 
that they treated me like gold when my Audi was in there every 
stinking week at $500 a whack, but they won't touch my bus, here's how 
our conversation went basically:

Me: &lt;describe the problem&gt;

Him:  Oh, boy it's been a long time since I did that.  I know 
there's a procedure but I just don't really remember it right now. 
It's had to be 13 years since I did that last.
 
Me:  Well, why don't you just tap it out and put a new bolt in.

Him:  Well, it's sure been a long time since I did that.  I just 
don't know what we'd get into when we looked at it.  I know 
there's a procedure for it.  I just can't remember.  But I know there 
is something we used to do.

Me:  Fine, forget it.  

That's basically the conversation.  Since he was so eager NOT to 
do it, I thought I'd rather not have him touch the bus.  Idiot.

So I went to the parts counter to get a 12mm x 1.5 tap. 

&quot;Ummm we don't got that.  Try the place (american car parts store) 
across the street.&quot;

Cross the street.

&quot;Yeah we got it.&quot;

So re-threaded the bolt went in, but it doesn't feel right.  You 
know, that sort of feeling that if you tighten it too tight your 
going to strip it out.

So the rear bolts torqued down good, and the front one at maybe 50lb, 
we'll go until it comes out again.

I'm assuming the next step is a 13mm tap, and bigger bolt?  Any other 
suggestions.
