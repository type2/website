To which David Schwarze replied:

&gt; Take it all to a machine shop and have it &quot;hot-tanked&quot;.  Then paint it
&gt; your favorite shade...

This is what I did whan I rebuilt the 1700 in my 72 18 months ago.  I had
it hot tanked, then I primed it with a rust resist primer and followed that
with a rust resist enamel.  Finally, I used nail polish to highlight the
cylinder numbers on the top tin.  This still looks good after ~8000 miles.
