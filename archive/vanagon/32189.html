Enjoyed reading about some of the ads. Here's a few of my faves:
Looking down on top of Beetle next to 23 window deluxe.
Caption &quot;Regular size...Large economy size&quot; (1963)

Night view across parking lot, silhouettes of cars, 21 window lit gently by
moon
Caption &quot;You'll never lose it in a parking lot&quot; (great photo, 1964)

Front view of 21 window
caption &quot;Introducing the 2 family car&quot;(1966)

Lady staring into cab of Samba
Caption 'If you can sell her this you can sell her anything&quot; (1963)

Old split, minus wheels (flower boxes instead) big EAT sign above, guy staring
out wearing sort of chef outfit, signs in windows say Chili, Franks soup and
snacks. Caption &quot; Old Volkswagen station wagons never die&quot; 

...and of course just for those whose ladies catch them thinking of another...
Huge phallic looking gearstick with round end etc._dot_caption &quot;Does the
stickshift scare your wife?&quot;..say no more!

Quicksilver, Country Joe ...them were the days,,where have they gone!
