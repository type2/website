Subject: Re: (heater?) replacement

and now, a message from our sponsor, der List-Meister,  Gerry S.

&gt;Now....has anyone on the list put a replacement heater in?   Any hints on 
&gt;sources? 

This is a long shot, but I have a nice heater unit removed from a Citroen I 
once owned. One of the big flat-iron style cars, a DS-21 model, 1972. It was 
in the trunk, behind the rear armrest and ducted into the rear passenger 
footwells. It's a complete unit, motor, squirrel cage fan, 4&quot; x 4&quot; radiator, 
all in a plastic casing the size of a shoe box ('bout a size 12 mind you).
        This was salvaged with the intent to put a solar H2O panel and 
anti-freeze loop onto the roof of SkiBus (aka Blunder Bus #1, a '71 Westy) 
to keep it warm while I was playing in the snow. Luggage rack while 
travelling, unload and tilt up at sun upon arrival, and next week I'm going 
to build a submarine..... Needless to say I didn't get far with the free 
heat idea. Try looking for one of these units maybe, if things are right for 
their survival where you are. It may also only be a Canadian 'cold-climate' 
option.
        Have you tried truck/bus mfg's for auxiliary H2O heaters? Probably 
not under $100. Used?       tim s.
