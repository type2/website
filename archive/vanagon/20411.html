So Dan Houg says:

&gt; Sales:  Martha Rubin/Steve Johnson.  Women can sell cars.  Boy, can 
&gt; they sell cars.  Wrapped in the latest flannel, no buyer can resist 
&gt; the charms of a saleswoman that knows her Blummenvasen from her 
&gt; silver socket.  

Martha: &quot;Is that a power ratchett in your pocket, or are you just 
	 happy to see me?&quot;  ;)
 
	&quot;Why sure... We'll be happy to include the peanut-butter 
	 under-coating honey.&quot; :)

&gt;Steve?  Well Steve just pummels the customer with 
&gt; verbage until they are so dazed, they'll buy anything.

Steve (Me):  &quot;That?  Oh that's just that legal-ese jargon that
	      has to be submitted so it doesn't look like your
	      being cheated.&quot;   ;)

&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure I've missed some of our staff... perhaps others could fill 
&gt; in?   :)
&gt; 

How about advertising?  I believe Bradley and Jack Stafford fill that
category nicely with their pyro-techiques.  :)

  &quot;Just follow the road that heads in the general direction of the
   bright glow and toxic smoke plumes.&quot;  ;)
