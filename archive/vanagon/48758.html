Subject: radio code f up!!

Opps, did I almost sAy the F word, well, it true!  I friged up the anti
theft radio in the 88 Westflia I recently purchased.  I was making some
adjustments to the vehicle, disconnected the battery and thought I had
fifteen chances to enter the code when I powered &quot;Moo&quot; up again.  I only
had three chances and the radio has shut itself down.   I left for a trip
to the excietd states with no radio!!! So I bought a nifty one with a cd
player, and get this, a remote unit.

Question is I'd still like to enter the code in the old radio... can that
be done without having to send the radio to VW Canada???  Or would anyone
like to buy a radio... cheap??
