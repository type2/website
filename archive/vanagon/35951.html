&lt;&lt;  By the way, have I mentioned that your &quot;remote-control guess-work&quot; has so
far been invaluable in my quest to know my beast best?   ;^)

Ruthie,

It is good that you've found some value in my opinions but there is a troll
under our electronic bridge.  Our remote-ness is a double-edged sword, often
causing me to mis-read the symptom descriptions posted by some list members.
 And having mis-read, I go into Automatic Babble about the wrong subject.
 Most are wise enough to know a fool when they hear one and are kind, but
others assume I can Do No Wrong and immediately remove the front bumper as
directed, even though the problem is with the rear.  I am reminded of Abbott
and Costello.  Or Buchannan and Dole :-)

Lists such as ours should come equipped with enourmous yellow signs:  READ
WITH CAUTION.   Immediately followed by:  THIMK FOR YOURSELF, or something
like that. 

Free advice is worth exactly what you pay for it.  Free BAD advice can prove
very expensive to the faithful.

-Bob

PS -- It being Friday I think I'll inflict that nugget on the rest of the
gang.
