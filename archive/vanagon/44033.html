Subject: front end 'dog tracks'

Hi Volks,
   Over the weekend I had the opportunity to ride behind my Vanagon in
another bus.  I noticed that the front end appears to be offset to the
left. I can see the left side of the Van quite well.  The fellows at the GM
garage I work at call it 'dog tracking'.   They also said it usually caused
by a broken leaf spring or center bolt on leaf springed vehicles.. But
because the Vanagon has coil springs thay could give me a good reason why
(other than it might have been hit).  I also noticed that it pulls to the
left.   My questions are:  why is it like this and how do I fix it?   I an
going to align the front end this week.  I just wanted to know if is
something I should look for.  Any help will be appreicated.  Thanks.
