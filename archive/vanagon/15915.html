&gt; &gt; I have a Revell 1/25 Vanagon Camper that has a workable rear hatch and 
&gt; &gt; sliding door; can be built with top up or down.  Don't know the year.  
&gt; &gt; Also don't know they still make 'em.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Any more info on that model would be great. Wouldn't still have the box
&gt; woodya?
&gt; 
It's still unassembled in the box.  Box says &quot;Volkswagen Vanagon Camper&quot;, 
no. 7329 (barcode is 31445 07329).  Copyright 1982, so you can narrow it 
down.  Molded in orange plastic (yecch).

My kit came missing one of the clear-plastic side windows, but any serious 
kit-basher could get around this.

Bought it about 10 years ago.  Ex-wife thought I was nuts.  Have vague 
plans to build it one day, but the Revell &quot;Panel Pad&quot; split-windshield 
and Tamiya Beetle will have to come first.

Hope this helps.
Joe
