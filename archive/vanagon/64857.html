Subject:      windshield rubber seal

Hi Volks,

Anybody shopped around for the front windshield rubber seal lately? Any
comments? Prices?

WCM lists about $107!! Geez, I just bought one for the '71 Rustfalia for
about $20!!!

What about using the old one? I'm replacing the windshield in the '85
because it is cracked REAL bad. The old seal looks fine, but...

Thanks!

ps - good to be driving a brick again :-)
