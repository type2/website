Do you have a carburetor? In my 1984 1.9l it was the accelerator pump
diaphragm hanging off the carburetor that had perished. I had to replace
that part, cost GB#35 main dealer only, and then the problem was 100%
cured.

I had to do it because the hesitation was actually causing stalling at
lights.

&gt;         What the devil causes that initial hesitation when you
&gt; accelerate from stop lights?  In my 79 westie, there's always been this
&gt; anoying hesitation before the power is there.  Usually I'll avoid it by
&gt; just reving the engine up a little before I let out the clutch pedal so
&gt; the RPMs go up a bit before I put the load of the motor on.
&gt;
&gt;         For a while I had a problem where the RPMs were too high and
&gt; this problem went away.  But that's gone and now my hesitation problem
&gt; is back.
