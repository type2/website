In regards to converting /viewing pics of VW', requested by Mike Heron....

,
Mike,- I advise a program called CPIC, which is by Photodex-
you can GO PHOTODEX on Compuserve and download CPIC.exe, the absolute best
viewing program (in terms of speed, even on a 33meg 486 I use).  It will
convert all formats, accepts a scanned file. It's for either Windows, and
the self-extrtacting file is about 550k bytes- I can send it to you via
Prodigy or Compuserve If you can give me an ID, or on a disk if you send
Addy- it's a shareware product that inserts a date into windows reg.dat
file, and will stop in 30 days- you can delete the file (keeps track of
file  manager associations),  (or rename it to keep using program- but I
bought it ($35, well worth it.)  Now, I suppose we could send a picture
here UUencoded (converts Assci to text), and let others decode it (simply
need uudecode.exe &amp; uuencode, or Wincode, available most anywhere).
Hmm, think I'll try a test JPG file.....  MB in NJ
