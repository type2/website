Subject: General Common Mods. ?'s

	
	Hey all.  I've got a couple of mods I've been thinking about 
doing on my '85 Vanagon, and I was wondering if any of you more 
experienced folks could give some advice.  I've got the basic 7 passenger 
station wagon model.  Nothin' fancy here.  I was thinking about pulling 
out the middle two person seat, and then possibly trying to put the 
camper/westphalia seat in place of the back seat.  Is this a relatively 
easy thing to do?  In other words, can a just pull a bed-seat off any 
80's Vanagon and just bolt it into the same holes that my old one came 
out of?  Any idea how much it would cost?
	I also would love to have a tachometer on my Dashboard.  Anyone 
know if it's possible to pull a dash with a tach. and somehow rig it up 
to work?  A nice Oil Pressure Gauge, as opposed to just a little red LED 
would be nice too.  Anyone?
	On a much more large scale note, someone posted about a week ago 
about trying to put an '86 poptop onto an '85 vanagon.  I never saw any 
replies. This sounds like a major Operation, but I'm not really sure.  
Thanks for all the help in advance!!!
later..



&quot;Keep on keepin' on!&quot;
