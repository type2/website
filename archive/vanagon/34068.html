&gt;Confusion ripples across a half-dozen pimply faces.  Gears? 
&gt;Teeth?  I climb into the truck, fire it up, back out.  &quot;And you
&gt;need the little spring because I say you do, so put the
&gt;sonofabitch back in.&quot;  Hard stare at the Master Mechanic.  He 
&gt;blinks and I drive off.  The kids gape after me.  

Bitchin' story, Bob!  I mean, you chromed that little weasel's butt!
Chopped and lowered him even!
