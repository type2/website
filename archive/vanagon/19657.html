Any good VW mechanic should be able to work on a turbodiesel.  
However, my VW parts man (A.J. at Wes Lasher VW in Sacramento) told me 
about a Canadian traveler who stopped by in his Westfalia turbodiesel to 
get a new air filter element.  It had a VW part number printed on it, but 
it was not listed in any VW USA fiche or parts list.  It was impossible 
for A.J. to get him a filter.  So, any parts unique to the TD Vanagon are 
probably very hard to find in the US.

There is a machine shop in Eugene, Oregon that (I guess) specializes in 
rebuilding turbodiesel Jetta and Quantum motors.  I will post their name 
and phone number here if anyone asks.  There is a man in Sausalito, 
Calif. who will modify motor mounts and some other stuff to fit Jetta or 
Quantum turbodiesel engines into the Vanagon.  Finally, there is a 
dismantler in England who specializes in transporters and who had a 
turbodiesel at one time.  I would imagine that a German dismantler have 
all the parts needed for a conversion, but I have not been able to make 
contact with any.    

I'm on step two of my Vanagon TD conversion.  I found a motor and am now 
working on rebuilding it, but it has been impossible to find a set of 
pistons for a reasonable price.  I've had thoughts of selling it if 
piston prices don't come down.
