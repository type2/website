&gt; as I got home, I drained out the oil, and it looked awfull!  Not sludgy
&gt; looking, but almost like it was diluted with something!  It also had
&gt; a silvery sheen to it as it sat in the drain pan (I thought it might
&gt; be metal shavings, but I couldn't see any when I took a sample between
&gt; my thumb and forefinger).

It could be too fine to see that way.  More like metal dust.  If it is
&quot;shinier&quot; than fresh oil then it's likely you have a big problem.  Like
Muir says, you should consider tearing the engine apart now, before it
gets expensive.  Especially with that counterweighted crank - you don't
want anything to happen to that puppy, cause they cost a pretty penny.

&gt; Am I overly worried about this?  That noise can't be good, or is it
&gt; normal for relatively cool engine?

I think you are underly worried about this.

You should not hear any knocking, with the possible exception of a very
gentle knock the first 5 seconds before the oil is circulating.
