&gt; It's called Kool Seal Elastomeric Roofcoating, and is
&gt; available (probably among other places) at Camping World.  I used about
&gt; 1/2 gallon to do my roof, and did several coats.  It's water soluable,
&gt; and very easy to use and clean up.  I used the same company's other
&gt; products to patch and seal a crack I had near the skylight opening space,
&gt; and this also behaved asmirably.  Good luck...

And if anyone in Canada is thinking of redoing their poptop with this stuff, 
drop me a line.  I have 2 quarts or the roof coating plus a quart of patching 
cement and a roll of patching fibreglass.  Lief's roof is in excellent condition 
so I have no need for it.  I bought it for my last bus but the friendly 
neighbourhood drunk driver had other plans (footnote:  he apparently got 
convicted because I recently got my deductible back -- he had said that his car 
had been stolen so ICBC wouldn't give me my deductible until they had someone 
else to hold responsible for the accident).
