&quot;To clean the oil,trans fluid and other gunk I left on the garage floor,  I
went to the store and got the cheepest clay cat litter i could  find.  I then
spread it on the floor put some music on and danced on the litter.  When I
had danced until I could dance no more, i sweeped up the litter to view the
nice clear floor.&quot;

Which song?  &quot;What's New, Pussycat?&quot;
