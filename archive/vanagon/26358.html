Subject: Source for OEM pop top seal

OK, I've seen the American made substitute, I'm not impressed,
does anyone know of a place to get the OEM seal (1 piece, molded
rubber, steel clips all the way round) for a '77.  Although
the imitation is quite serviceable I want authenticity for
my parents '77 actually I have removed the origional whch was
still OK and replaced it with the imitation for now
in case I never find an OEM one, but I'd like to come by one
new, dealer no longer can get round here.
