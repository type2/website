&gt;    let's hope we don't git rained out this time!  yea, I'm up to a 
&gt; gathering March 1.  I'm in chapel hill.  Let me know if you need any 
&gt; organizational help.      Scott
Sounds good, it is (of course) APRIL 1, but I'm sure you figured that.
I'll post another call to action as the time draws nigh.
Hopefully the weather will be better, it was great last year.
Richard
