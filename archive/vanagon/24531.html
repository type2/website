&gt; On my longest trip in Beethoven (up to Crater Lake) I waved like mad at any
&gt; bus in sight.  Waved about 50 times (there are lots of buses in California).
&gt; Got waved back at twice.  Ah well.  I think waving might be more prevalent
&gt; where the buses aren't.

On my run from Media, PA to Beaverton, OR the ratio of waves/bus increased
as population density increased.

I got VERY heavy-duty waves from driver and passengers whenever I passed
a vanagon that was also transporting a canoe, like I was. :)

I made sure I waved at every bus I noticed.
