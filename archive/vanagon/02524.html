Subject: Fuel tanks and caffeine substitues
Date: Mon, 1 Aug 1994 19:37:50 -0400 (EDT)


Good people,

Before I get to the real important question, for which I need big-time help,
I would like to offer a caffeine substitute as a stimulant. As a frequent
long distance traveller, I find coffee to be too taxing on my plumbing (I 
know *every* rest stop withing 500 miles), and straight caffeine pills put me 
right on the edge of murder. 

So, I have found that ephedrine HCL (25 or 50 mgs) is a super OTC remedy for
sleepiness. If that is not available, Pseudoephedrine works, but not nearly
as well.
1) I am *not* a doctor  2) I play doctor as often as I can
3) My desire to play doctor always is greater than my opportunity

REAL PROBLEM STARTS HERE

I decided the $700.00 Fuel Tank was too much, so I gambled and tried to
fix the one I have already...

I pulled the fuel tank from NuBus (82 oil burner) to find the hole. I found
it and patched it with epoxy tank repairer, and did not make Steve Smith's 
mistake of wire-brushing the other rust off (Which makes more holes).

Now, I have a fule tank under NuBus on the ground, with all these hoses
which do not reach the tank on the ground. Do I connect them *after* I put the 
tank in, *during* the tank installation?  What about that filler tube.
How does THAT go back in? Does anybody recall the magical sequence?

Would 50 Mgs of Ephedrine help?
 
Do Unix-like incantations help?
