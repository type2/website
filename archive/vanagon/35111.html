Ahh, but you're neglecting the psychological-warfare aspects of
driving a microbus equipped with 'roo bars around in city traffic :-)

In this area, there is a non-negligible possibility of hitting
something deer-like.  Heavier animals are possible, but unlikely.  It
would be nice to know that I'd get some additional protection from a
normal front-end collision (i.e., with another vehicle).  I'm less
concerned about body work than mechanical damage (steering box, lower
legs, etc).

What sort of cost is usually associated with acquiring and installing
aluminum-based bars?

Thanks.
