     &gt;If you pre-heat the system by running on DC for a little bit you may 
     &gt;find that the lighting goes a bit easier...
     
     Saturday morning, my fridge was being especially stubborn.  Finally, I 
     watched the flame in the sight glass while I lit it.  The flame lit 
     right away, then died out in about 5 seconds while I was holding the 
     button in.  This happened several times.  Since gas seemed to be 
     getting there, maybe the flame was  running out of air?  So I lit the 
     flame again, then gently fed air to it with the air pump.  This kept 
     the flame alive, and after a minute I stopped spoon feeding it and it 
     continued to run.  Maybe a fluke, but I'll keep it in my box of 
     Dometic tricks.
