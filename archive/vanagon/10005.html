Joel,

Coolant reservoir is coolant reservoir, isn't it?  Pressurized and 
connected to coolant system?  The overflow tank is the one which you see 
when you fold down the license plate cover.  I mean the coolant reservoir.

I filled it through the bleed bolt hole in the radiator.  I had that 
sucker about 24 inches in the air, held up by my trusty manure loader.
