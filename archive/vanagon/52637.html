No disrespect but by Chryslers definition the rear engined buses are not 
cab forward.  BUT...

Cab forward is the engine mushed as far forward as possible with the 
wheels moved to the corners.  

Older buses had the engine obviously not pushed forward and the wheels 
were not as far to the corners as possible.  Lets though look at the 
newer VW buses.  Well engine is mushed as far forward as possible. and 
the wheels are pegged to the corners.  SO the EV is cab forward.

Lookj at the slope of the hood on the various vans and minivans.  EV is 
the sharpest rake of any non-rear or non-mid engined bus.

&gt; i was watching the Chrysler minivan commercial, andit said something 
&gt; about &quot;more interior space &quot; than (posssiblpy said) any car in its class 
&gt; &quot;due to its cab forward design&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; i started screaming at the TV of course...i tend to do that these days..
&gt; told the TV that hy ol' 69 has more interior space than it, with its REAL 
&gt; cab forward design..and that my 75 has even more, with its total lasck of 
&gt; interior...and roof...hmm...i think i was just in one of those moods, ou

&gt; &gt; &gt;Well....letseee here.....
&gt; &gt; &gt;They've &quot;invented&quot; the following so far....
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;-&quot;Ch**sler - We invented the Minivan&quot;   (a.k.a. the sh*tbox)
&gt; &gt; &gt;- &quot;Ch**sler - We've thought of everything&quot; Introducing our revolutionary
&gt; &gt; &gt;concept
&gt; &gt; &gt;of  dual sliding doors on a van  (what a breakthru concept!!!)
&gt; &gt; &gt;-&quot;Autostick transmission&quot;   Duh, there's a first..... (Hmm....weren't they
&gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt;ones who also came out with that push button auto trans? looks like that one
&gt; &gt; &gt;was
&gt; &gt; &gt;a real winner too)
&gt; &gt; &gt;-a (sorry excuse for a) Pickup truck with 3 doors....(or was that
&gt; &gt; &gt;chevr-oilet?)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;can anybody else think of any more of their &quot;inventions&quot;??
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; A BIG one!!  With the introduction of the Intrepid/Vision/&amp; the Chrysler
&gt; &gt; model I can't remember the name of, the touted their breakthrough design
&gt; &gt; inovation of:
&gt; &gt;                   &quot;Cab-Forward design&quot;.  
&gt; &gt; You want cab forward?  I got cab-forward!  All Vanagons have &quot;cab-forward'&quot;.
&gt; &gt;  All previous versions of VW's van have &quot;cab-forward&quot;!!!
