Anyone near buy?

        I'm looking for someone to help out with some general maintance on
my Westfalia.  I'm near Intaca, Cortland, sort of near Syracuse, or
Binghamton. I'm an hour or much less from all these places.  I'm looking for
a tour guide to my engine compart ment.  And/or someone to help with coolant
change and tune up.

        Any takers?
