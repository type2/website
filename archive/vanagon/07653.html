Hi all

I just wondered if anyone knew about thermostats.  I have a 72 Kombi There
is no thermostat an no way to circulate air (where the fan is housed).  I
think there is supposed to be one or both.  My other Kombi didn't have
either ine either.  Am I missing something or being perceptive????

Thanks in advance

Tracey
