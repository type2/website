&gt;Any suggestions?  Please tell me it is not engine killing as that was the

It sounds like your flywheel end crank seal is going / gone. This
slowly leaks oil while the engine is running, which gets flailed
around inside the bell-housing. Then, when you stop, it all runs down,
&amp; out of the hole in the bottom ! (My '71 did the same).

Unfortunately, it's an engine-out job to fix it. It will only get
worse, and will eventually saturate your clutch with oil. The seal is
cheap. No doubt someone will recommend the best type to get......

Causes ? :

Bad luck - a seal may just decide to give up, especially if the engine
has been standing;

Crank end-float - excessive end-float in the crank makes these seals
wear quickly. It can be assessed (with the engine in the van) by
grabbing the crank pulley (engine stopped !!!) and alternately trying
to pull it bodily out of the back of the van, and push it through the
engine. If it moves (backwards &amp; forwards, not round &amp; round) enough
for you to *see* it (rather than just feel/hear a clunk, then there
may be excessive end-float.

Either way, you'll have to replace the seal. FWIW, as long as there's
no sign of a huge amount of play in the crank, I'd replace it with the
best you can get, and see how long it lasts. Others will^H^H^H^H may
dissagree.... ;-&gt;
