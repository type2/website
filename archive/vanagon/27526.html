Hey kids, listen to Thom here, 'cause this works!  We did a similar thing 
for our drive through eastern Canada (and the perhaps soon-to-be 
Sovereign Nation of Quebec  :-(  ) last winter, and it kept life at -40 
survivable, it not actually balmy. 

We vented our gas heater to blow directly to the enclosed front cab area, 
and we were cozy down to -20 or so.  Got a little cool, but not too bad, 
below that.  Makes a big difference at less extreme temps under just 
air-cooled heat too.

One suggestion I might make is too use heavy clear plastic sheeting (like 
from $4.69 special plain Wal-Mart shower curtains) and duct-tape the 
edges to the roof and interior walls of the bus.  The adhesive comes off 
nicely in spring time with some 3M remover.  A clear partition allows the 
driver to see out the back; canvas would not.  Then again, I tend to rely 
almost exclusively on the side mirrors, so maybe transparency isn't such 
a big deal.
