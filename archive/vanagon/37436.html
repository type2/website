Subject: Re: 4-pos. windshield wiper


&gt;down as in toward your lap.  It was a standard fitting here in
&gt;South Africa.

So, some buses definitely came with intermittent wipers, then there's a good
chance all the necessary wiring is already in place on those that didn't.
I'll have a rummage behind the dash and see if I can figure out what's what.
When I get a chance, it's snowing right now. Intermittent wipers would be
handy for the constant drizzle that passes for an English summer :)
