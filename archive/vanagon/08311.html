Subject:       Cheesy blowby fix?

Has anyone ever tried hooking the air intake from a 12v blower (ie a 
raft inflator) into their crankcase to reduce crankcase pressure?  
I'm ready to try that on my '85 with the chronic leaking crank seal 
(haven't replaced bearings yet, Marshall).  I've got a neat little 
raft inflator who's intake would slide into the 3/4&quot; breather hose 
but I haven't hooked it up --  also, this inflator is cheap and 
probably wouldn't stand up to continuous duty without a meltdown.  
Just an idea whose time may have come.  Maybe I could use that breast 
pump.....
