Subject: Callaway Vanagon Turbo

Callaway once developed a $1985 turbo conversion kit for the air-cooled
vanagon, boosting hp from 75 to 105. Shouldn't be much of a stretch to
adapt the same to wasserboxers.

&quot;For additional information, write to Callaway Turbocharger Systems,
Stewarts Corner, Lyme, CT 06371.&quot;
