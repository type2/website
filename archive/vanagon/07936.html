Now I can tell you why I really bought a Westfalia - a new member of the
family! My daughter Madeline was born at 12:40 pm Thursday and she is
without a doubt  the best Christmas present ever...I hope the westy's
still around when she's old enough to drive....then again...  -- 

here, have a virtual cigar...
