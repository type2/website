Subject: [For Sale] 1988 VW Westfalia

Though I hate to do it . . . . 

I am presently offering for sale my beloved Westy.  It is a &quot;back to school&quot;
sale and I will consider all serious offers.  I will also entertrain absurd
trades as well, as we will be taking a portion of the proceeds to buy an 
older Westy.

So if you have an 83-85 and a wad of cash, let me know.

Otherwise, contact me via email for the details.  If necessary, call, though
you might not hear me through the sobs.

W.
