Subject:      Re: oil filler

On Fri, 1 Nov 1996 21:03:28 -0600 you said:
&gt;I know you all probably knew about this forever, but I just discovered
&gt;tonight that the oil filler tube actually extends out so you can pour
&gt;the oil in without spilling!  That's really clever and I never would

:) just NEVER let the idiots at the gas station put gas into your car!
they'll think the oil filler is the gas cap!!!!! true story! and what
i've found useful when filling the engine with oil is to put a towel over
the license plate flap-door when it's in the down position ... you'll
spill a little oil from some of these plastic bottles (they're full near
to the top!). also: do NOT put the oil filler cap on the bumper. set it up
in the rear deck area or on the ground. if you put it on the bumper, you'll
knock it over behind the bumper ... and you'll have to have a &quot;gotcha stick&quot;
(one of those grabby thingies that mechanics use to retrieve dropped parts)
to get it out!!!

&gt;I'm really impressed with the design of the Vanagon as compared to the
&gt;Bus, tho I really like the Bus fusebox location better, you can pull it
&gt;down and turn it around easier.  Too many wires on that Vanagon fusebox!

i removed my fuse box cover so i could get to the fuses (and the fuse box
screws) easier. but definitely too many wires. yeah. too many wires. lotsa
wires. yeah. too many wires. ;)
