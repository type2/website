Subject: Renting camper in Germany
Date: Wed, 14 Feb 1996 14:08:15 -0800 (PST)

Volks,
	A good friend of mine is going to honeymoon in Germany and wants to
rent a camper.  I think this was discussed before but I can't remember
if there was any information available.  Does anyone know if there are
places over there that do this?  Ric?  :)

Thanks,
		-David
