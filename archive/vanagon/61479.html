Subject: A good tire deal or not?

I need to replace the tires on my 85 Westy.  I got a quote from Merchants
tire here in Springfield VA of $76.95 per tire (includes mount, balance,
stems, disposal) + tax. The tire is a 205/70R14, Perrelli P-400, load rang B
(1433lbs capacity) with an 80,000 tread warantee.

Is this a good deal or should I keep shopping?  I called about 3 or 4 FLAPS
and no one could find 205/70R14s in load rang C or D. 

Anyone in the DC metro area have any luck finding a good deal on tires?

Thanks,
