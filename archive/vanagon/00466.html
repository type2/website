Okay well the next time I plan on doing some body work I
will be sure to call you and ask your advice before I do
anything.  Perhaps you'd be willing to drive down here to
DC and do all the work for me for free, eh?

I think you compltely missed the point.  A &quot;professional&quot;
job would have cost me between $400-500 (which, incidentally,
is three times how much I paid for the bus to begin with).
I did the whole repair for about $95.  I'm sorry I didn't
do things up to your standards, but compromises needed to
be made.  I posted the story for like-minded individuals,
not you.
