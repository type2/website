Subject: Ben Pon

Type Twoers:

A few years ago DB&amp;HVWs had an article on the humble
beginnings of our loved ones (or twos) which included the
hand-drawn sketch Ben Pon drew in his notebook of the basic
design of engine-in-back, us-in-front, and lots of space in
between.  I know I've seen this sketch again in a recent
publication but I can't remember where.

Did I just dream that, or was it in something more recent?
Thought one of you might recall.

TIA
