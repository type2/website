Subject: Mazda Westy?  SyncroJeep?

the latest issue of Popular Science has a featurette on 2 All New 
vehicles...

a pop-top Mazda MPV with amazing amenities like sleeping room in the 
pop-top, a stove, water tank, sink, fridge.

an All New Jeep for '96 that utilizes a viscous coupler to the front 
differential.  this amazing device transfers torque as needed to the 
front thru a coupler with interleaved plates running in a 
silicone-based fluid.

it's all so amazing.  and vaguely familiar....

complete junk)
