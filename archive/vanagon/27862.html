Subject: Re: Loud valve noise on startup

&gt;This morning I fired up my 84 and was assailed by very loud valve
&gt;noise.  I presume that a lifter is sticking as this has happened a couple
&gt;of times before and it usualy goes away after a few miles as it did
&gt;this morning.  My question is
&gt;
&gt;1.  Should I just ignore it until it happens
&gt;again and does not go away (can it do any damage)?
&gt;
&gt;2. Has anyone had experience of cleaning the lifters and if so could they
&gt;give me some first hand info (are they similar to the air cooled?)?
&gt;
&gt;3.Can hydraulic lifters be adjusted?
&gt;
&gt;4. Would using lighter synthetic oil help the problem?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks

Mine does the same thing. I know of no damage happening. There is a basic
adjustment of the lifters, and it wouldn't hurt if you had it done. Don't
know about synthetic oil,never use it.
