Question:  How far can you tilt a Westy Syncro before it falls over?
(Not that I've ever been anywhere close)

Syncroad:  Near Elk City, Idaho, this is the start of the Magruder
Corridor through two huge wilderness areas.  Most of those 113 miles
are single lane dirt, but I didn't need the crawler gear or difflock.

Between cloud layers on the Benbow mining road west of Absarokee,
Montana.  The road ends at a high meadow known as the &quot;Golf Course&quot;
and a trail leads from there up the Stillwater Plateau to Lake
Wilderness and Mt. Wood.  URL:http://www.gj_dot_net/~bhkraft/stillh2o.jpg

One of those gnarly campsites on the edge of a cliff with a great
view.  This spot is on Bald Ridge northwest of Cody, Wyoming.
Crawler gear and difflock required to get up there.

Across the canyon, Shoshone Nat'l Forest road 120 (Morrison Jeep Road)
starts at US Hwy. 212, descends the Dillworth Bench, then zigzags down
the side of Clark's Fork Canyon to the Yellowstone River, Clark's
Fork.  I saw no 4-wheel vehicles on the road, only mountain bikes.
A road for Syncros to avoid!
