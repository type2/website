Subject:      Re: Gas in Diesel

does anyone remember the story about how you can make &quot;emergency diesel
fuel&quot; from gasoline mixed with motor oil??

i recall one of the vw magazines took a diesel into mexico and couldn't
find any diesel fuel, so they mixed 30w motor oil with gasoline to the
ratio of 1 liter of oil to 5 liters of gasoline (?? not sure of that)
and came on home. changed the oil, and the bus kept running ever after
without trouble.

anyway that's how i remember it, but i am NOT sure of that ratio. anybody
know better??
