Subject: Re: Big Motor Homework/Syncro Glitch--Oettinger, etc.

&gt;&gt; Yet the 3.2l Porsche 911 engine MSDS uses is installed in a Syncro.
&gt;&gt;     In stock configuration, that must be about a 230hp engine. We need to
&gt;&gt;     talk to him about how the drivetrain has held up; certainly, he
&gt;&gt;     will know the weak links.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;When I talked with him (about 1.5 - 2 yrs ago) shortly after articles
&gt;appeared in magazines, he said that it was working great.  I'd be interested
&gt;in an update.  I might call him if I get a chance.
&gt;


OK, whoever is closest gets to call him, aw I lose! Tim Smith
