Subject: Door Rubber Alternative? (Baywindow)

A local fellow gave me a couple of baywindow doors the other day. I 
thanked him, took them home, and proceeded to strip them of hardware I 
may someday need. The doors themself are too far gone to keep.

At any rate, I noticed the rubber around these doors wasn't stock, but 
instead, a D-shaped, self-adhesive material. Has anyone ever heard of 
such an alternative to stock door rubber? Naturally, I'd rather have the 
real deal, but if I can seal up the bus for $20 or even $40 with this 
stuff, I'd jump on it while I spent the normal $400 we spend for door 
rubber on more important things...like maybe tires.

Thanks! Joe
