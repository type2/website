&gt;Righteous!!  You're way out of my league.

&gt;&quot;You can't please everyone, so, you've got to please yourself&quot;
&gt;        -Ricky Nelson, 'Garden Party'


Just to pick a nit, Ricky sang Lonesome Town, _Rick_ sang
Garden Party.  Had something to do with growing up
which is *why* he wrote Garden Party in the first place.
