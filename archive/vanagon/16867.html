Subject: Take out the trash!

My mail has been locked up for a couple of restless days. Thinking that I
had been subjected to the nasty end of the Karma stick after a couple of
recent flippant responses, I finally found out that I had been negligent in
the &quot;empty trash&quot; option of my Eudora tool. *Major DUH*! Coming from the
UNIX background I thought message\delete meant delete, like gonzos, fini, no
mas, gone forever. WOW, after clearing 20mb of VW mail I'm back to haunt you
all. Gee, I wonder what Freud would say about Spamming one's self! Learned
my lesson. I promise to be a good doobee (at least for today);) 
If anyone listed the source of the $100. one owner, little old man '51 23
window in my absence, I would appreciate the address. Otherwise y'all might
remember to take out the trash.
