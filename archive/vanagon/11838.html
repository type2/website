Subject: '56 update fun

From: &quot;Thom Fitzpatrick&quot; &lt;thom_at_tim_dot_com&gt;

I just wanted to tell everyone about how much fun I just had
lubing up the front end of my bus!

I bought one of those mini grease guns, and crawled under the bus
and started chipping the old dried up grease and dirt and putting in new 
stuff.

I always get a warm fuzzy when I clean up something like this!

The grease gun and 3 tubes of grease was $18.00 plus change.  I feel its paid
for itself already!  I'm gonna drive the bus around a bit and then re-grease 
it tomorrow.

I am also having a strange problem.  I am getting a squeaky out of the front 
right wheel.  It squeeks witht he car in the air and me turning the wheel.
It appears to be the brake shoes rubbing on the drum, but instead of the
scruff-scruff that would normally may, its squeeking!  It has new wheel
bearings and brakes, so I don't think there is some sort of failure, just
an annoyance that I don't know if its serious or not though.

Also, whoever it was that emailed my about offering to help with wheel
clips, can ya write me again?  I hosed my mail file...           

Thom
