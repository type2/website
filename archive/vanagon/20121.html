Subject: Prices on 36hp Motors

Hi,

	I found a 36hp motor in a bug at a junkyard today.  It is compleat,
including the crank start nut.  They want just a bit under 200 for it.
Is that a good deal for a 36hp motor?  It didn't look like it'd thrown a rod
or anything...  It was missing the carb and air cleaner...

	What should I look for on these motors?

	Sppedy replies appreicated - I doubt its going to si there forever!

Thom
