So Eric Oster says:
&gt;    Anyway, is there anything special I need to do to `prime' the EFI
&gt; so I don't blow it up? I've heard rumors that if they run out of gas
&gt; you're pretty screwed. Should I just take the coil wire off, and crank
&gt; for a few minutes, put it on and pray, or ???? Push the FI off a cliff?
&gt; Put dual Dellorto's on? (I heard they stopped making them for VW's?)
&gt; Take the EFI off, and run a petcock valve straight off the fuel line to the

Well Eric, I'd would write off the EFI until I'd tried thoroughly to make
the existing system work.  You must have a late model '74 as the earlier
'74's were still dual carbs.  I'd use the 'Idiot Guide' and make sure
all the electrical connections were clean and makeing good contact
including the ground strap and positive battery cable.  I'd probablyu
replace all of the fuel lines with good ones that can take the EFI
high pressure and throw in a new fuel filter.  Do a tune-up, change
the oil.  The EFI systems work fine when everything is hooked up
right and all of the components are working.  Be sure to watch
for leaking injectors.  You don't want a gas fire!  You can get
rebuilt ones to minimize the cost of replacing if needed.  Make
damn sure the battery is good or you may be trying to track down
problems that aren't really the EFI's fault.

Cheers!
