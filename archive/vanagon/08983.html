So Ian E. Abbott 225-1793 says:
&gt; Hey all-
&gt; 
&gt; 	Well, my elder brother (Bill Abbott, '70 Single Cab) sent me 
&gt; enough stuff gleaned from this list to convice me to subscribe also. 
&gt; So far, it looks like fun!
&gt; 
Welcome to the nut farm Ian!  (Oh no! Another Abbott! ;) )  I better
be good, Bill's reserving a space a Pfeiffer for me and the Mrs. :)
&gt; 
&gt; 	So, in a fit of ugly passion, I excised the A/C from the van, 
&gt; and have been very happy with the result. Now the windshield looks 
&gt; bigger, I don't hit my head on that stupid duct, the engine is easier 
&gt; to work on, and my conscience is clear about the ozone layer!

I can understand in a cold climate, not wanting the AC (you didn't say
specifically where you were?)  Anyway, being in Sac, I've been toying
with the idea of somehow rigging in the A/C ducting from a Vanagon bus
into my '91 camper so that I can get cool A/C to the front!  Is that 
the kind of ducting you took out?  (Can you tell I'm drooling? ;) )  
If so, do ya wanna get rid of it?  I'd be glad to take it off your hands.  
Let me know if you do and maybe we can work out an equitable arrangement.

There that didn't sound so bad did it? :D

Well.....I had to ask.....

Cheers!


Steven
