On Fri, 19 May 95 16:53:42 CDT you said:
&gt;Can someone clue me in on what a &quot;type II&quot; is ?
&gt;I suspect that there are &quot;body type I, II, III...&quot; and
&gt;&quot;engine type I, II, III, IV, ...&quot;.

well, not exactly. vw started out with the beetle, so the first type was
naturally a Type 1 ... and all beetles (including the karmann ghia) were
Type 1's.  the bus was designed next, so it became Type 2, and all buses,
including the pickup trucks, panel vans, etc., were all Type 2's.

the next car produced by vw was the fastback/squareback which was the Type 3.
then the Type 4 at about the same time, and it's cars were called the 411 and
the 412. note that ALL models, 4-door, 2-door, station wagon, etc., of the
Type are still called Type 4 (or whatever type you are talking about).

later, as the water-cooled engined cars began to replace the air-cooled
engined cars, the Type number increased: Rabbits were Type 7 (there were
some not-exacly-well-known types in between), and so forth.

now, in absolute technical terms, vw internally calls things a slight bit
different, but this is close enough (vw uses 2 or 3 digits to correctly
designate a particular model of a Type).

if you look at the VIN of your cars, you can see the VW Type ... the Westy
will have a 2, and the golf should have a 7 in the same place in the VIN.

now, as to the engines ... well, that kinda got things all screwed up. see,
the beetle being a Type 1 car had a engine that became known as a Type 1,
but it really wasn't. likewise, the Type 4 car had a &quot;new&quot; engine that was
also used in the Porsche 914 and the buses after 1971, and that engine became
known as a Type 4 engine. but the engine itself never really had a &quot;Type&quot;.

the buses tended to make things a bit more confusing, as they were always
referred to by their &quot;generations&quot; or T-number. so the buses from 1949 to
1967 were T1 Type 2's. from 1968-1979 were T2 Type 2's. 1980-1991 T3, and
the current Eurovan 1991-???? are known as T4's (but they are STILL Type 2).

some folks get things muddled and confuse the T2 nomenclature with
the Type designation, and this gets other folks really messed up.

hope it helps.
