Subject: EV piston slap

Hi, 
I am new to the group and am interested in finging out some maintenance 
information on a '93 EV.  We are in the process of buying one (31K miles) 
and in scanning some of the older threads in the forum noticed a few 
problems.  The one problem which I was not familiar with was piston slap 
and I was wondering if someone could explain the problem and describe 
the symptoms. 
 
Any other thoughts on the '93 would be appreciated. 
 
Thanks, 
Chirs L. Miller
