Subject: A question about rubber parts...

In my 77 Westy, as in others, there is a hard plastic strip taht supports the
top bed, where it folds, when it is in the bed possition to keep it from
sagging in the middle, well, my poor little Claudia is missing this part,
anyone know where to find one of these ?

I have looked just about everywhere, and called everywhere else with no luck,
I am just about to try and rig something, unless one of you know-it-alls
knows where to get this piece.
