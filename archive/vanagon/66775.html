Subject:      FS  80 - 82 vanagon parts.

HI V-gonauts,
I am cleaning out some junk.  I have a some parts that I recovered off
of a 1980 California vanagon last fall.  I want to get rid of them.
Free to anyone who wants to pay for shipping and a beer while I box it.

Drivers side heat exchanger (California style), assuming I can get it
free from the other exhaust parts.)  I should really charge for this
but ....  It is in good shape from what I can tell.

Gas Inlet: The plastic piece that connects the gas tank to the side of
the car.  It is PArt No: 251 201 129.  I think this is year specific but
not sure.  It is different from my 82 westy.  Not cracked or broken, a
little rust on the upper metal.

I may have more as I find stuff as I goi through multiple boxes of
parts.  Thats about it for now.  First come, first gets.  I have wiring
harnesses, other trivial parts so if you need something maybe I can
help.
