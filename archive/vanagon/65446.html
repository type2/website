&gt; &gt;I have an '88 with the exact symptoms you describe. With one additional
&gt; &gt;feature. If I blip the throttle sharply up to about 3500 rpm I can get the
&gt; &gt;idle to drop to 1000. I'm taking it to a local mechanic tomorrow, as I
&gt; &gt;don't have the time to fiddle with it myself - but the mechanic said that
&gt; &gt;often the throttle butterfly gets coated with carbon and then does not
&gt; &gt;close easily - hence high idle. I had already checked the idle stabilizer
&gt; &gt;and cleaned that out - so I'll know tomorrow what the verdict is.

&gt; More likely is that the bearings and/or the butterfly shaft that rides in
&gt; the bearings of the throttle housing have become worn.

If you need a new throttle body, you can expect to have to pay the
dealer +/- $600.00.  I would look far and wide for a used component.
