Subject: Re: engine removal 71 bus


&gt;1) the top right bolt through the starter keeps slipping away as you try
&gt;and thread the nut back on. I ended up
&gt;getting my daughter's boyfriend to lie under the bus and hold the bolt

I've seen on several busses (especially with doghouse oil coolers, on
which this is a HUGE problem), the top right bolt has a different head.
Instead of your basic 17mm hex-head, this bolt has a D-shaped head. The
flat part of the D rests next to the ridge on the engine case, and keeps
the bolt from turning as long as it's pulled tight (even finger tight)
against the engine. A cool and elegant solution to a nagging problem.

I don't know if this D-bolt is original VW, or an aftermarket piece.
I would guess that you can find them at VW junkyards, or shops where
lots of VW work is done (mechanics NEVER throw away such handy items!).

Another thing, if you can't find such a D-bolt: Douse your regular bolt
with WD-40 (while it's off the car), worke the nut on and of until it's
free and easy, clean it up real good, give it another light shot of
WD-40, and try it now. If you're lucky (hmmmm), it won't turn as you
thread on the nut. If your nut/bolt is banged up and binding, get a
new one-- it repays the cost in aggravation and skinned knuckles many
times over.
