Subject:      Hesitation

        What the devil causes that initial hesitation when you
accelerate from stop lights?  In my 79 westie, there's always been this
anoying hesitation before the power is there.  Usually I'll avoid it by
just reving the engine up a little before I let out the clutch pedal so
the RPMs go up a bit before I put the load of the motor on.

        For a while I had a problem where the RPMs were too high and
this problem went away.  But that's gone and now my hesitation problem
is back.
