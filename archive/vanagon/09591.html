Great!!  Thank you!  I am very interested in participating in an East 
coast gathering, but I was kind of waiting for someone else to disobey 
the old Army rule.  :-)

&gt; So far, in several queries, I've not sensed a &quot;serious' interest.
&gt; 

Seriously, interested!

&gt; I've not been an organizer in the perspective before so if someone will 
&gt; sign-in and guide me, I'll attempt to do as much of the work as possible.
&gt; 

Me neither, and I am coming up on our annual busy season at work, but 
maybe we muddle through somehow?

&gt; Of course there MUST be those who are willing to participate and will stay 
&gt; on through the planning and until the event happens.
&gt; 

Can do on the participation, and will do my best on planning.

In so far as a destination is concerned, I like both North Carolina and
Ontario, but ould prefer to stay south at this time of year (sorry,
David). Either the Smokey's or someplace in PA that would be mutually
inconvenient to a number of us.  The other suggestion I would hang in the 
breeze is Florida. It's a long drive, but warm when you get there. 

As for timing, how is everyone set for GW's Birthday?
