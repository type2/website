Subject: Re: Opinions on WCM products?

We (Volks Cafe) use and sell a good deal of WCM stuff, in the years 
I've worked there I can't recall a complaint on the quality of any of 
the products.  I do remember a problem with cloth coming from two 
different runs of dyeing though.

  I have had good luck with the fit of their products too.
