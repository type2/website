&gt;To All:

&gt;Replacement of all springs, return &amp; stand-off, keepers, nails, and
&gt;self-adjusters,  is a good idea when replacing brake shoes (and makes the 
job
&gt;go faster).  Drum-brake hardware kits are normally available wherever you 
buy
&gt;brake shoes.  If ordering from J. C. Whitney the stock number is 55FH3487P,
&gt;seven bucks (for two wheels).  Cite year, make &amp; model when ordering.

&gt;In a similar vein, any time you replace the front shoes or rotors it's a 
good
&gt;idea to replace the grease seal ($2 each, also avail from JCW [listed under
&gt;Wheel Bearings]).   You may also find my post on Brake Grease of interest.
&gt;(Sorry; JCW doesn't carry it.)

&gt;(No, I don't work for J. C. Whitney but I usta do brake jobs for Pep Boys.)

&gt;-Bob
