&gt;In that excellent Fishing Expedition R&amp;T article, there was an intriguing
&gt;phrase: &quot;a modest torque peak (106 lb-ft at 2600 for the Wasserboxer right
&gt;now, but watch this space)&quot; - ??? what was on their minds?  Have there
&gt;been variations on the wasserboxer engine?  Was VW contemplating something
&gt;more radical for the late Vanagons?  I'm not talking about minor tuning
&gt;variations for automatic vs. manual, or 2wd vs. synchro.  I think VW had
&gt;shelved all the 6-cyl air-cooled experiments by this time.
&gt;What kind of leak were they planting in R&amp;T's ear?

the story that was 'leaking' was the 6-cylinder wasserboxer ... supposedly
Oettinger 'bought' it from VW (who, as you say, wasn't too interested in
6-cylinders). that engine (6-cyl) actually had wheel-spinning power. but the
cost was prohibative in this country.

and R&amp;T may have gotten the 'rumors' of the increase from 1.9 liters to
2.1 liters (with the 1986 model) confused with the 6-cyl. who knows what
goes on in the brains of those magazine people? i mean, what if YOU had to
slave at a job such as that? imagine! camping out in a VW bus and then
having to WRITE about it!!! horrors!!! i'm just glad i've got a lowly
crumby backwater government flunky job. ;)
