&gt; lost.  Can I lay in a new piece of sheet metal and seal the edges with 
&gt; some high temp silicone sealant or some such?  That is the first thing
&gt; that comes to mind.  Any other fixes for this?  Thanks, Jim

My father and I did the such a thing on a bus.  We made sandwich of two
aluminum sheets, plastic sheeting and aluminum sealant.  Everything is held
together by pop rivets.  After cleaning/cutting the rust, the sealant is
applied around the edges and plastic sheeting place around the area to
repaired.  The aluminum sheets are then cut to fit on the top and bottom
of the area and then pop riveted in place.  We also used undercoating to
finished the job.

This was done for the battery area, the driver's floor and the flooring
next to the sliding door.  It worked out well until we sold it.  We also had
done this for several cars and it holds up well.  It takes a lot of time and
effort but never has to be worked on again.
