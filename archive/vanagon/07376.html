This isn't rally bus related, but since we have an esteemed employee of
Intel in our midst.  (would that be like Gorillas in the Midst?) :)

Q&amp;A:  THE PENTIUM FDIV BUG

Q:  How many Pentium designers does it take to screw in a light bulb?
A:  1.99904274017, but that's close enough for non-technical people.

Q:  What do you get when you cross a Pentium PC with a  research grant?
A:  A mad scientist.

Q:  What's another name for the &quot;Intel Inside&quot; sticker they put on Pentiums?
A:  Warning label.

Q:  What do you call a series of FDIV instructions on a Pentium?
A:  Successive approximations.

Q:  Complete the following word analogy:  Add is to Subtract as Multiply
    is to
        1)  Divide
        2)  ROUND
        3)  RANDOM
        4)  On a Pentium, all of the above
A:  Number 4.

Q:  What algorithm did Intel use in the Pentium's floating point divider?
A:  &quot;Life is like a box of chocolates.&quot; (Source: F. Gump of Intel)

Q:  Why didn't Intel call the Pentium the 586?
A:  Because they added 486 and 100 on the first Pentium and got 585.999983605.

Q:  According to Intel, the Pentium conforms to the IEEE standards 754 and
    854 for floating point arithmetic. If you fly in aircraft designed using
    a Pentium, what is the correct pronunciation of &quot;IEEE&quot;?
A:  Aaaaaaaiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeee!
