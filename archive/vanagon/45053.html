Subject: I have strayed...


Hippies, Micro Bussers, Breadloaf Lovers, Vanagonauts, and even
Wannabussers,

I am here to as forgiveness as I have strayed.  Yesterday I purchased a
non-brick shaped VW [but as closed to a brick as possible], a Safari/Thing.
I must admit, I have always had a thing for the Thing ;-)  Last week,
a friend showed I an advertisement in one of the local auto-seller rags
for a 1974 Thing [side vents...bonus].  The price good...almost too
good... as most Things around here are either rust buckets
(affordable) or prohibitively expensive [$5000+], I hesitated for a
few days [kept telling myself that it would be sold already].

Finally on Thursday, I phoned and spoke to the owner's mother.  She
described the vehicle's condition to the best of her ability...it was
enough to warrant a look-see.  Yesterday morning, I jumped in the
Jetta [the Westy is still on jackstands] and set off on the ~600km
voyage to look at the car.  Four hours later [I'll deny this to any
form of law enforcement;-)], I was pulling into a driveway facing the
original definition of &quot;so ugly, it's cute&quot;.

Before the owner came out, I managed to crawl around and have a look.
The body is in 'good' shape, a little rust along the bottom of a
couple of the doors, and just ahead of the rear passenger-side, fender
well.  The frame was good and straight.  The driver's side pan should
be replaced [this will be a new adventure for one who has always owned
Bricks].  It has new shocks and tyres and a *real* pretzel exhaust
[first one I have seen in person...most of the Things around here are
sporting Bus exhausts].  The plastic windows are shot.  It is also in
need of a paint job....but there is *no* Bondo!!!

The engine was recently rebuilt and the clutch replaced.  It has all
new cables and he has a new top, extra capacity oil sump, brake shoes
and various other parts for it.  He also has a pile of manuals [and
English translations], parts catalogues, etc for it.  The fellow
really seemed sad to see it go [He fell ill and as a result of an
operation, his back does not appreciate riding in the Thing], hence I
didn't try to drive the price down.  We agreed on $2000.00 Cdn
[~$1450.00 USD], I gave him a deposit and we set a date for me to pick
it up.  I then jumped back into the Jetta and drove home in less time
than the trip that morning.

So though, I went for a non-Bus....it is the next best Thing ;-)
[Ok, enough bad puns...I will go now.]

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Bricks...Oh, my!

Roy
