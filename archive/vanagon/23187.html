 &gt; I was in England and Europe in 1971,  [...]
 &gt; I saw a few different varieties of three-wheeled cars-- some with
 &gt; one front and two rear; some with two front and one rear. Smaller
 &gt; was obviously better in Europe/England, since gas cost about $1.90
 &gt; per gallon while it was $.30/gallon here (remember those days?).

Apparently one of the reason that 3-wheelers such as the Morgan were popular 
in the UK, was that 4-wheeled vehicles paid tax as &quot;motorcars&quot; whilst vehicles 
with fewer wheels paid a lower tax rate as &quot;motorcycles&quot;.  Thus, three-wheeled 
cars were technically motorcycles &quot;within the meaning of the Act&quot;.

Also, the tax was based on displacement of the engine, with the rate going up 
something fierce, thus encouraging smaller cars. 

I don't even want to think what the tax on a Bentley 8-litre would have been...
