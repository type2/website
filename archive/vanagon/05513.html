&gt; 
&gt; My wife totaled our 86 Vanagon Westfalia and we have several parts 
left over 
&gt; that are for sale.  
&gt; 
&gt; Bra or noseguard(as my wife calls it) $20.00 This will fit any of the 
&gt; square headlight and thinner bumper models.
&gt; 
&gt; Screen for rear hatch $ 20.00 (This is probably a fortune from VW.)
&gt; 
&gt; Shipping not included.
&gt; 

Larry I would be happy to purchase the rear hatch screen if it will work 
in an 85 GL.
