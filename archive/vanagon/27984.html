Subject: Joel, change the stats!

(Wow... didn't think I'd be sending a message with this subject for 6 months
or more!!)

A very belated and hearty THANKS to all who responded to my posts of last
week, as regards the consideration [&amp; subsequent purchase of] my:  

'87 Syncro Westie -- (as yet unnamed. )

All went well, with the long story for those interested, below.
Technical specs: full Westfalia package; 4sp; 88K miles; power steering,
mirrors; new transmission &amp; clutch; alloy wheels; Denon sound system; piaa
fog lights; trailer hitch; and all standard trimmings.

Funny thing is, last Thurs I was planning to head down to Chapel Hill in 3
days, to consider purchase of a Toyota Celica FS there, and drive around
while looking for a late model syncro westie. Saw a post on the list here,
for a loaded '87 in great shape, asking price $12K....and only a 1/2 hour
drive from where I live, here in NYC.

Later that afternoon I ended up putting down a deposit on a final sale price
of $11,3. Though the bus looked in great shape, and drove smooth as could be
(as far as my less technical sensibilities could decipher), there were no
repair records to be had and it did feel a bit risky. Now, now... I know some
on the list might dispute the rushed and impatient lack of bargaining with
which I acted. But since I was the first to get there, and didn't care to go
through the stress of waiting till the ad came out in local papers the next
few days, potentially losing the deal to a higher bidder, I opted for
security. This was, afterall, exactly what I was looking for, and I think
fairly priced for what it was.

Anyway, technically, the bus is in great shape.  I'm waaaaaaaaaaaaay pleased.
:-)  Feels so much different than the '71 westie I had 7 years ago when
living out west. About the only thing I need to worry about is finding more
work to offset the increased cost of garaging it here in
&quot;break-in-and-take-a-look&quot; urban NYC.  :-(   But its well worth it -- I'm
happy as a clam.

Adios for now,
--Jonah
