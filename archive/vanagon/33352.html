Subject: busses on tv

Anyone see that video on MTV where a band shoots the entire video from
the inside of a split-window bus?  The singer is driving and at the same
time singing into a microphone coming from the ceiling.  The guitar player
bass player, and drummer are all huddled in the back with their 
instruments and amplifiers and cords taped all over the place.
I can't remember the name of the group, but it was a &quot;New Video,&quot;
so it should appear soon again.
