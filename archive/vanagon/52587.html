Subject: Planning a trip &quot;around the block&quot;

Howdy All!

I am in the preliminary stages of planning my next vacation.  I took no
leave this year so I will have a solid month next year.  The theme of this
trip will be to stick at least (and in some cases, at most) a toe in every
major body of water surrounding the North American continent.  

&gt;From my start point here in Washington, I plan to drive NW to Hudsons Bay,
over to Alaska and up to Prudhoe Bay, back down to Seattle and along the
Pacific coast to the Gulf of California, over through the southwest and
Texas to New Orleans and back to the Atlantic coast and DC. 

Anyone with suggestions, ideas, opinions, hot spots, rest spots or
information about routes (especially y'all who went to Inuvik), I would
love to here it. 

The &quot;window&quot; of time when I will be able to take this month is between
May 1 and July 15.  I would like to be above the Artic Circle for the
solstice, which probably means that I will be leaving closer to June 1-7,
but that may change due to work requirements.
