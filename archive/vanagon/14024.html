Subject:       Re: 12v dropping resistors


&gt; &gt; 5. try the circuit out with your new resistor to see if the resistor 
&gt; &gt; heats up excessively, if it does, the wattage rating isn't high 
&gt; &gt; enough and you need to get a higher rating one or hook 2 resistors of 
&gt; &gt; twice the desired resistance in parallel.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This last idea won't work. Putting two resistors of equal resistance in 
&gt; parallel halves the resistance. So the voltage would be too high.
&gt; 
But... but... but...  i said hook resistors of *twice* the desired 
value so when the parallel circuit cuts the resistance in half it is 
the desired value.  won't that work?
