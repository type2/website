Subject: Vanagon Control Unit Break-In

With all the recent talk concerning hesitation, and bad connections within the
control unit, I was wondering has anyone had the chance to take their's apart?
I did read a message about a month ago concerning a guy who did it and found bad
connections inside.  How difficult is it to get inside without damaging the unit
itself?  I'm just dying to tear mine apart, probably a big mistake, to see if a
loose or bad connection is the possible cause for my bad idle.  I may give it a
shot this weekend.  I'll keep you all informed.......good or bad.
