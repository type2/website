I used to have a 72 Bus and I had a situation where my oil was getting
thinner.  And fuller!  The culprit was the fuel pump--it was designed in
such a way that when it went bad it allowed gasoline to get into the oil.

Dave, I would check this.

What exactly went bad, I think I am having a similar problem.  I have a 73, I
know that gas doesn't make the best lubricant, and I would like to remedy this
problem without a complete teardown.
