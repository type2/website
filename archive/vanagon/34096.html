Subject: '62 brake victory!!!

Hey,
	Victory at last! I pryed those shoes out this afternoon, (wearing
protective goggles).
Pulled out the pistons -- everything looks surprisingly OK, I'm wondering if
this is all really necessary. This van is pretty new to me, so I don't know when
the brakes were last replaced, so I figure it's a good plan to replace stuff so
*I know* it's all up to scratch. Yes? Especially as I've never seen this stuff
before &amp; won't be the best judge of whether replacement is necessary (or not).
Once I've seen new cylinders &amp; shoes I'll know what they're supposed to look
like for next time. And anyway the brakes weren't working well &amp; pulled to one
side.
	Next stop, detatching hoses &amp; cylinders.
	Thanks to everyone who helped with this, I really appreciate it.

Sarah
