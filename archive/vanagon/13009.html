Subject: The shower thing :}

I think rigging a shower would make the camping experience nicer and more 
comfortable - so on with it.
I was told once:
&quot;You can be miserable and uncomfortable the very first time you try it - 
to be comfortable in a bad situation takes some practice.&quot;
Might apply here :-)
