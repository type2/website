Subject: coolant leak found

The leak appears to be coming from the left-hand &quot;temperature sender -
injection&quot;; the drawing shows a seal under it.  I suppose I'll get a new
o-ring and try replacing it...

There is also a pool of liquid around the expansion chamber level sensor,
so I guess that its o-ring is dead, or maybe the entire sensor...

What are we supposed to do with drained coolant these days?  I imagine that
down-the-gutter is somehow harmful to the environment (or maybe just my
cat).
