Subject: RE: 74 camper, Gas Heaters

&gt;Hi Daniel,
&gt;I just installed an Eberspaecher BN2 underneath my '76 Camper.

      Underneath? Literally underneath? Wow! How do you
      deal with speed bumps?

I also 
&gt;have the installation instructions, owners manual and trouble shooting guide.
&gt;If anybody wants a copy of those, please let me know.......
  
      If you can scan the pertinent photos/illustrations,
      I'm sure someone would be only too happy to 
      incorporate them into a T2 web site...
