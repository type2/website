Subject: &quot;BakePacker&quot; -&gt; Wonderful Oven thing

We love to make good things to eat, hate to cook, hate to clean up lots 
of dishes, pots, pans, etc... so mostly we &quot;Heat&quot; don't &quot;Cook&quot;! 

Every once in a while we find a truly neat gadget that makes it easier - 
found one at R.E.I. called the &quot;BakePacker&quot;. This is an inexpensive 
($13.40 for the Standard &lt;larger&gt; size) It fits down into a 7 1/2 to 8&quot; 
pot and allows you to bake mixes that you put into a Glad food storage 
bag (1 gal size) mix in the bag by squeezing - put 1&quot; of water in the 
pot, put the bag full of goodies on top of the BakePacker (a grid sort of 
thing), bring the water to a boil, turn it down to a simmer for 15-20 
minutes, take out th bag and serve. The clean up is throwing away the bag 
and emptying the water. 
There is a smaller version called the Ultra-Light which is about 5&quot; or so.
The folks that make this little jewel are &quot;Strike 2 Industries, Inc., 
Spokane, WA&quot; &lt;kinda makes you wonder what went before and what is coming 
next&gt; 
The thing is shaped sort of like cutting a 2&quot; wide cross section of a 
pipe with a grid in the middle - sold in a plastic bag type of display. 
We have made rice dinners, baked goods and such in it. Works just like it 
says in the included instructions and recipe book. 
Enjoy - Jack
