&gt;When replacing a pilot bearing, are there any special tricks or conditions

Make sure the felt washer/seal between the flywheel and crankshaft is still
there. Replace if needed.  Still available at dealer.  Some repalcement
bearings also have lip seal built in.  use this if possible.  Grease does not
matter once the clutch dust gets in.  Felt does better job of excluding the
dust.  two seals better than one.  If trans input shaft is damaged at all, it
must be replaced.  Cost about $65 at dealer.  Relatively easy to change.
 Only need to remove bell housing, possibly loosen output bearings.  Should
take less than two hours once trans is out.  BTW, servicing clutch in vanagon
is easiest buy removing trans, not engine. Trans is lighter and less needs to
be disconected to get it out.  Even in a syncro.  This is probably especially
true in the V6 Vanagon now needing this work.
