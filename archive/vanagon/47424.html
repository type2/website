Subject: Re: Alternative alternators?

Right. and when you're done, remember to duct-tape the windows, get extra
locking mechanisms for the doors, and install double hinges for the
rear hatch :-)

You might also want to get some kind of JATO unit for moving the vehicle
while the diesel just sits there and powers the stereo :-)

Seriously, though, any stereo system that draws more than 100-150 Watts
inside a vanagon is either a health hazard (for your and your vanagon's
health, that is), or is a waste of money.  As it turns out, most high-power
rated audio systems just claim to have components that handle that kind 
of power -- not necessarily produce better sound energy.  A few (yes, a few)
watts of pure sound power inside a chamber the size of Vanagon is enough
to blow one's eardrums.  The rest of the power -- well, that actually goes to
heat up your vanagon (remember those fins on your car amplifier?).

If you need more electrical stuff, you may still need a high-powered
alternator.  However, when it comes to audio, spend your money on
speakers, not high-powered amplifiers.  If you _match_ a high-quality set
of speakers with a decent mid-size (40 watts?) amplifier, you should get
more sound than you can handle.  How much of the electrical energy you put
into your stereo gets converted to sound energy is the key.  (a 50 watt
stereo at full power would draw 4.1 amps...)

&gt;I've an '83 diesel Westie into which a new audio system will soon be 
&gt;installed.  My new technical advisor for this formerly owned an auto 
&gt;audio shop and won some Florida audio championship for three years with 
&gt;his promotional van that was featured in several magazines.  Even for a 
&gt;modest high accuracy system, he insists the Westie must have at least a 
&gt;65 amp alternator.  I installed an inverter, and for recharging a second 
&gt;battery, I wanted to increase charging capacity anyway.
&gt;  So what applicable more powerful alternators are available?  I suspect 
&gt;a few gaser owners would also like to know what alternatives fit their 
&gt;Vanagons or EVs.
&gt;
&gt;  I'm not committed to going forward with his plans yet, but I have 
&gt;agreed to pay for a system design.  If and only if there's interest in 
&gt;the key elements he specifies, I'll post that information on the list.  
&gt;I've been told installation/design is at least as important in 
&gt;determining final sound as component selection.  
&gt;  Thanks ahead for any good alternator upgrade leads.
