So Martha says:
&gt; 
&gt; I think it would be good if we can decide collectively where to place
&gt; the beautiful new stickers.   That way, when passing each other in
&gt; opposing freeway lanes at 74 mpg, we'll instant recognize the other
                            ^^^^^^ ???

Uuuh.. Martha, I don't think anyone is going to be able to meet this
requirement unless they're being towed!  ;)
