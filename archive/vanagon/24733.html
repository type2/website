Subject: Re: empirical data on heating a bus



 &gt;Glancing through the my 1964 owners handbook, the section on heating
 &gt;says that by opening a cab side window or a vent wing the amount of
 &gt;hot air flow will be increased. So your observations are exactley how
 &gt;the system is designed to work - according to VW anyway.


Or at least, that's how VW found it TURNED OUT to work... Same difference?

Note that, in 1971, all Beetles grew a tiny, crescent-shaped vent behind
each rear quarter window. Guess what it's for...

 -Steve Maher   smaher_at_gi_dot_com   '71 VW Transporter in San Diego... what's
                                 a heater?
