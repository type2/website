Scott &amp; List,

  I've done the Diesel to Gas conversion.  We had the same problem with Noisy Fuel
Pumps AND pumps locking up.

  We found the solution;

  The early vanagon fuel tanks have a smaller diameter outlet than a later tank (86
and up I think).  There wasn't enough flow in the earlier tank and the fuel pump was
starving for fuel.  We installed a tank from a 87 Vanagon with the larger outlet and
the noisy pump problems have gone away.

  We too used the fuel pump and filter set-up from the fox to mount to the frame of
the Vanagon.  This set-up worked well and fit well.
