Subject: Re: Stale gas/ winter storage?

Your local WALMART likely sells a gas stabilizer to keep off the
varnish and sludge monsters for the winter.  STABIL is the brand they
sell around here,
$5-$10 the quart squeeve a few ounces in the tank, fill her up, run it
a bit then let it sit.  Course the '77 parts bus I just bought had not
been run in 3 years and the gas cap had been off, but the fuel in the
ring main upon dissasembly was fine, no sludge, nuthin, but the tank is
likely a mess.  certainly a little prevention never hurts.
