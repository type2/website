&gt; Well I took a look and:
&gt; &quot;Volkswagon Bus Camper Van 1979-89&quot; by R.M. Bentley was published in _1911_ and 
&gt; sells for $16.95.
&gt; 
&gt; My first question would be if anyone knows if Amazon is carrying the service 
&gt; manuals for the 2045-2069 Volkswagon VTAL Orbitors yet.
&gt; 
&gt; But this can't be the Bentley service manual can it?  It's way too cheap.
&gt; 
&gt; Have you already figured this out Brendon?

Yeah, I thought it was pretty cheap too.  But then I don't know any 
better yet.....
