In a message dated 96-05-02 03:58:00 EDT, you write:

&gt; If memory serves me right, the space in this list is donated and I don't
&gt;think we have much to say about the format. Let's live with what we have
&gt;when we have it.
&gt;
&gt;

I'm not the type to look a gift horse in the mouth.  I enjoy this list a
great deal and I wouldn't want to see it end or make the owner angry due to
my selfish requests.  I hereby take back my comment and apologize to anyone
that my remark may have offended and to their extended families as well...
and to anyone who has ever spoken to their extended family members... you get
my point.
