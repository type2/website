&gt;for those of you interested in the Concept 1, they have some spy photos
&gt;of the &quot;prototype&quot; &lt;NOT the little car that was shown around previously&gt;.
&gt;it's longer and lower and doesn't look as much like a beetle anymore. :(
&gt;looks more like a toyota. :P

maybe because the  Concept 1 didn't allow enuf wheel clearance to let
the car turn a corner? ;-)
