Subject: VW Bus - still thinking about it.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the '78 the best year for the late type 
II's (I know that's hard to say without comment).  I say that based on the 
availablility of the 2.0 engine during these years.  I understand that the 
hydraulic lifters are a benefit as well the exhaust system (which is still 
fairly easy to find vs. the '79 version).  I'm assuming that the version of 
automatic transmission used was improved from the first version a few years 
previous (just a guess).  I have been told that the fuel injection on the 
later models is also a benefit over the earlier buses.  If these are points 
of debate, please let me know (as well as any other suggestions you may 
have).  Around here buses are hard enough to come by and I want to make sure 
I get the best year I can.  

Thanks!!
