if you kids don't stop this nonsense, i'm gonna start hitting you with stuff
like Choo-Choo-C'Boogie,  Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy of Company B, When My
Dreamboat Comes Home, Glow-worm, Picnic, Poor People of Pairs, and other
wonderful renditions by truly Great Artists, as sadly mimiced on such shows
as The Hit Parade (that was back when television was a novelty!! and you had
to walk down to old man Moncrief's furniture store to see one). ha!
