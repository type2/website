&gt;&gt;Subject: 85 Vanagon Oil Light
&gt;&gt;Date: 5 Feb 1995 01:21:10 -0500
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I have a 1985 vanagon with a what seems to be an oil pressure
&gt;&gt;problem,after about 20-30 minutes of driving the oil pressure light comes
&gt;&gt;on ,engine looses power and develops a loud ticking sound.If I turn off
&gt;&gt;engine for a minute or two and restart it it runs fine for about the same
&gt;&gt;amount of time,and then the same old thing.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Anyone ?
