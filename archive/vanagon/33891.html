Subject: need information on a VW part number

My vanagon was rear ended. I found this small black box (crushed) right
behind the paasenger side tail light housing (also crushed :) ). It is made
by VDO and has the VW part number 251 907 393B. Can anyone tell me what it is
and what it is for?

Many Thanks
