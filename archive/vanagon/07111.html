Subject: RE:   Westy 3-Way Fridge Questions


&gt;I was not aware that some of the fridge ignition systems had a three way
&gt;LED set up. Mine glows red only if the fridge is working on LP, there is
&gt;no green....DC

On my fridge the flow meter is a true electro-mechanical meter with a 
needle.  There are three bands; white, red, and green.
