Subject: Re: Platinum Spark Plugs for Vanagons


I tried them and took them out after a few hundred miles.  Switched to
the Bosch tri-electrode and they work really well.
On my '86 (rebuilt engine) they performed WORSE than the stock, single
electrode bosch plugs.

My $0.02

 &gt;Volks,

 &gt;platinums not recommended and I can't understand this.
