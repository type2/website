Howdy, all,

I am taking a quick nod in and out as I sign off the list for a month.  I
will be leaving Thursday for a trip around the country in the Luggage.  I
have the GNATT itinerary and will be in some of the same places at some of
the same times, so may meet up with those of you in that spot at that
time. but I will not be following exactly.  The Luggage is a '78 white
over blue standard van with an orange rear lid and engine cover.  If you
see it, do something extremely obvious (but not dangerous).  Hope to see 
you all....
