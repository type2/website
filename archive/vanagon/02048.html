&gt; My 84 vanagon GL has gone through at least 3 times of pulling brake drums.
&gt; I had the same question you have. I wasted some time getting nowhere in
&gt; determining how to turn the adjusters. I then went ahead to pull the drums
&gt; without loosening any star wheels. I figured that if the wheels were able
&gt; to run it should be ok to pull them off.
&gt; 
&gt; I used a gear puller and they both came off without hassles. I did have to
&gt; loosen all star wheels later to push the drums back in though. You will find
&gt; out how to adjust them back while the drums are off.
&gt; 

My problem is that I have no puller. Do you remember if one has to go straight
in or from the side to hit the star wheel?

Thanks, Richard
