Hello everyone,
First, thanks to everyone who gave advice on how to inspect this bus. While 
it was in pretty good shape, the owner had too much time and money invested 
in it to sell it for what I might have been willing to pay. As many have 
told me, there will always be another bus.
Thanks again,
Matt Dekker
