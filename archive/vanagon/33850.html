&gt;As an alternative, for the truly paranoid, I suggest peafowl. 

Peacocks and some breeds of geese make excellent sentries.  Unfortunately, we
have a surplus of four-legged coyotes as well as the other kind.  While one
is stealing your semiphores the other is swallow your cats, geese and
occasional monkey wrench.

Some people swear geese can intimidate a coyote and they may be right, if
they literally mean a single animal.  But some nights I've seen a pack of a
dozen or more frolicking on the lawn of the school about 300m from my house.
( We're not allowed to shoot them, of course, due to the inherent evils of
gunpowder.  They have attached at least two children in recent years, killing
one of them.)

Nor are dogs as much protection as you may think.  I've had one poisoned and
another garroted by would-be burglars.

Staying near home and showing an eager willingness to shoot strangers seems
to be the best solution, at least in my case.  Indeed, in light of recent
court decisions regarding the responsibilities of public safety
organizations, a vigorous self-defense of your home and person may be the
only solution.
