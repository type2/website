Subject: Little Silver Socket

I installed the european 12V socket in my '73 Thing. (Found the 
socket in a junkyard)  I modified a spotlight and an auxillary 12V power 
outlet to fit.  The only difference is that my silver socket is black, 
and fills a dash hole better than the little black plastic plugs.
