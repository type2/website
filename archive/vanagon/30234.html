&gt;I have a 1990 Vanagon GL camper.  I am looking for a storage box to fit into

We use the grey coloured commercial version of the Armed Forces
'footlocker'.  It is made of plastic and is available in black, grey and
some other colours.  Samsonite is the maker and it is referred to as a
'Footlocker'.  It has a hinged lid and a lid stay to hold it open.  It is
watertight (almost water proof but some gets in if driving in a hard rain)
and has 2 clasps and a place for a padlock if you wish.  Two of them will
fit side by side across the van with almost no free space. They fit best
facing backwards (hinge to the front) Then you can access them from inside
the van if you wish.  I hold them down with a single ratchet/strap(?)
arrangement. We purchased a replacement just last june ( someone stole the
first from a campsite) from a local luggage shop for $90.00 cdn (+ taxes). I
think list was $110.00 each.  They are strong enough to double as a seat if
your stuck and can stack easily.  Our only problem is that when we want to
take the canoe we have to find room for them inside.
