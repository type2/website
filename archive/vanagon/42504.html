Subject: Old Busses FS (Sad)

On a trip to Kansas City this weekend I stopped in El Dorado Springs to 
visit an old fellow that I had me a couple of years earlier.  Sad to say 
that he is among the walking dead.  He is now forced to live in his 
former VW repair shop and his dream of restoring his '67 Westy is gone.  
He needs to come up with a couple of grand to get himself into a &quot;home&quot; 
to die.  He have several Busses (in various states of disrepair).  The 
'67 Westy (no motor or tranny), another '67 Camper (E-Z Camper out of 
California), a '65 home-built conversion and a '72 Westy.  I don't think 
any of these Busses a running/driving.  Help this old man and e-mail me 
for more details.
