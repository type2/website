Subject:       Alternate Engine ? Revisited

Steve/List,

Sorry to revisit this thread again, but does anyone out there have a 
name and number of someone whose put a Subaru 2.2 in an air-cooled 
type two (a pre-68)?  

Got a friend whose about ready to get a new engine and he's 
considering this option (if that's possible).  (or else a 2020cc if 
the Sub conversion is a no-go)

And no, Steve, I already told him no Citation engine!  &lt;big smiles&gt;
