Subject: East Coast Inuvik: Labrador!

There are *incredible* alternatives on the east coast. I've done em.

You can indeed drive up to Hudson's Bay and up into northern quebec on
abandoned reservoir roads and visit with the indians who live up there. The
big town northern James Bay/Hudsons Bay town (joke) is Chessassibi (spelling
wrong).

Or you can drive up through Qubec to Labrador (Labrador City, check out a
map) and then take the train to Esker, then drive to the Atlantic coast
(Goose Bay) then take the ferry down to Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick, visit Tim, and then drive back down through New England.

I've done both trips and they make the Inuvik trip look like a commercial-
winnebago-packed unattractive touristland by comparison. 
For my trips, few maps show the roads, few people take the trips, and you
can meet some real cool locals up there that arn't already jaded by having
lots of tourists around. I remember hanging out with Indians camping out in
real teepees, for example. They hadn't seen another tourist for two years.

Anyway, I can't go. But its there!
