This letter is to bring you luck.  It has been across the 'net seven
times already.

Thom Fitzpatrick deleted it, and couldn't sleep all night because of
drunken bus people caterwaulin.  He undeleted it, went out to the mailbox,
and his income tax refund check was there!

Make 10 copies of this letter, and mail them to all your bus friends.
Do not change it in any way.  Soon your income tax refund check will
come too!

Thom
