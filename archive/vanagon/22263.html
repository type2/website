Is replacing one cylinder a mistake? It sure is. Unless they all were 
brand new, and some fluke occured. Think of the time it takes to put it 
all together, put the engine back in the car, etc. And -- the only place 
you are going to get a single cylinder and piston is either a junk yard, 
or from VW -- the one a bad idea, the other very expensive.
   On the other hand, I once had to (on a trip) put a 1500cc cylinder nd 
piston in my engine with 3 other 1678cc cylinders. It ran. Got me there 
and back. Then I rebuilt it again.
