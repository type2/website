Subject: Re: Vanagon high-roof sighting

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; Today while driving by the local VW dealer I saw a Vanagon sitting in the
&gt; lot apparently awaiting servicing.  Why anyone would take it to the dealer
&gt; is beyond me, but that's another story :) .  This Vanagon was an air-cooled
&gt; model and had a non-Westfalia camper coversion.  It had a white fiberglas
&gt; roof similar to the roof on David Schwarze's Safare camper, with the
&gt; sliding windows on the sides of the high-roof.  The camper was beige and
&gt; the roof was white, looked like it added a couple feet to the van.  Anyone
&gt; know what company made this type of conversion for Vanagons?  Could it have
&gt; been a Safare?  
&gt; 
&gt; I've not seen this one around town before, thought it was kinda interesting
&gt; :)

There are several early 80s Vanagons around here like that, made by 
GetAway Vans. I test drove an '82 diesel model which was a tad 
slow. I mainly wanted to look at the diesel engine bay, since I had 
never seen one up close. The ones I've seen have lots of storage 
(front &amp; rear areas of the top), but NO sleeping area up top, which 
is a poor design IMHO. Also, the rest of the van used Westy cabinets, 
stove, fridge, etc, with the upper cabinets made to match, albeit 
of different materials.
