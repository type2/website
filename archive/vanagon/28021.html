WOW!  I've been told the VR6 engine in Vancouver sells for $10,000-$15,000 used!  
Grab it!

&gt; You know I was scanning the yards for some shifter pieces for
&gt; the Corrado and noticed a nice VR6 Passat with 9000 miles on the
&gt; odo, severeely hit rear.  Anyway the asking price for the engine
&gt; was $1500 complete with all f.i. system and computers etc.  Which
&gt; got me wondering anybody think of a VR6 Vanagon conversion.  It
&gt; wouldn't be cost effective compared to good old american V6 iron
&gt; but it would be &quot;pure&quot; VW.  Plus as both the good old 4 in the G60
&gt; and the VR6 volted to the same trannies, seems like maybe the conversion
&gt; would bolt up easier, though the clutch was severely redesigned and
&gt; who knows about clearance questions and oiling.  Anyway just wondered
&gt; if anyone had given it any thought.
