Subject: Fuelline/Shrinktube=Gasleak (Vanagon)

Hi,

I located my gasleak thanks to the advice of some listmembers.  The cross 
ventilation tube on top of the tank is made of a plastic-y material that 
has shrank from sitting etc.  Its shrinkage actually pulled and broke the 
plastic/nylon Y-fitting on the driver's side of the tank leaving 2 very 
smelly openings which, in turn, created a foul, nausiating, and dangerous 
odor and leakage.  Luckily I have a parts Vanagon in the garage.  

Why would VW use such a crappy material for something as important as gas 
ventilation/overflow???  Jeez...
