Subject: new engine from VW
Date: Tue, 16 Aug 1994 13:38:16 -0700 (PDT)

&gt; I've got an 1987 Vanagon GL, Wolfsburg Edition with (almost) all options.
&gt; Unfortunately, this Saturday while on the freeway, I think I popped the
&gt; engine.   Loss in oil pressure, clanking sound from the right side 
&gt; (possibly a collapsed hydraulic lifter under the valve cover?) ...
&gt; 
&gt; Or, possibly the engine sucked a valve or thrown a pushrod.   They all sound
&gt; the same, to me.  No black smoke, just a terrible clanking sound from the
&gt; right side.
&gt; 
&gt; It sounds like a rebuilt engine will cost me around $3000, including
&gt; installation.   Is this reasonable?   The body and interior of the car
&gt; is still in great shape.   Has anyone else had this experience with
&gt; their Vanagon?   If it is only a collapsed lifter, then the cost will
&gt; be more in the $200-$400 range.
&gt; 

I was talking to the parts guy at the local dealership.  He said that VW
has a deal to replace ANY vanagon engine for $2495 complete.  Something to
do with recalls and stuff so they just made a blanket rule.  He also
mentioned that most VW dealerships would try to steer you away from this
option to instead rebuilding your engine because the VW dealership makes
no money on the new engine under this plan due to the way the plan is set up.
