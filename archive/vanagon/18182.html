&gt;Subject: Re: Roof Racks for Westies
&gt;Some westiphile hseaver_at_csd.uwm_dot_edu asked about roof racks for his
&gt;netsurfwagen.
&gt;Here's what's worked for me.
&gt;
&gt;I have installed Yakima &quot;Wide Body&quot; mounts on the sides of the fiberglass
&gt;and reinforced the mounting with backing plates on the inside.
&gt;
Al Knoll,

I did the same thing you did on my 82westy  --8 Yakima mounts --4 on each 
side so I could install my factory Type 3 roof rack  --works really well.
BTW, do you know where I can get a good deal on a new '82 aircooled head
the one I bought made in Spain failed after 40K miles ---valve seat dropped.
Should I stop using synthetic oil?
Thanks
Ben 82Westy csdws_at_dbu_dot_edu











&gt;Properly placed, these will allow the attachment of rain gutter style
&gt;towers
&gt;and 66&quot; crossbars.  I mount a Thule Ski Box (Thule Combi 250) to handle
&gt;skis and things during the winter.
&gt;If you don't want to use the &quot;wide body&quot; mounts the yakima tower
&gt;extensions will
&gt;give a close fit between the roof and the crossbars but will work.  Mind
&gt;you
&gt;you won't be able to pop the roof without removing the racks.
&gt;
&gt;With the racks mounted to the pop up, and the equipment removed from the
&gt;Thule
&gt;box you can raise the roof but it's a grunt.
&gt;
&gt;As a sidelight, it's easy to park two bicycles inside and three more on
&gt;the
&gt;rear of the vanagon using a wide body bolted to the roof hinge assembly
&gt;to mount the crossbars/fork mounts.
