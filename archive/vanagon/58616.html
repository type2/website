Chris asks:

&lt;&lt; Jim, have you really seen a '85-'91 westy w/ this socket?
 just curious... &gt;&gt;

Just today, in a steady rain, three different previous mail-order customers
on vacations pulled into BBI to sample our wares and to view what they called
&quot;mecca&quot;, whatever that means.  1 had a 87 Westy, 2 had 90 models.  All had
the pretty little Silver Socket.  They even spent a little money too.

Shop behind me has an 85 Westy with one too and he has the Floor Mounted
Cooler attached to it as well. (This is the bare-bones Poptop, Weekender?)
