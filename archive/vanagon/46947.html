Subject: Re: VW FLAPS in Portland, OR?

&gt;Hiya all,
&gt;     Anyone know of a VW FLAPS in Portland? I need some VW specific parts,
&gt;also a VW friendly junkyard would be good. TIA...
&gt;Peace,
&gt;Eddie
&gt;
&gt;Hi Eddie :
No problem with VW Flaps in Portland. Halsey Automotive has a great
invetory. Autosport across the river in Vancouver is easier to access from
I5, but does not have the selection. Tell me what you need and I'll line it
up for you.  As for the junkyard , tell me what you need and I will suggest
the yard that will have it. Autosport has a small yard but there are yards
that have more stuff.
