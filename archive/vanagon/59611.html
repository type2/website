Subject: Re: Ready to Cry Wolf: 91 Carat Wolfsburg Edition?


&gt;Jim,

  You wrote  I have seen one that was a
&gt;1990, but the only thing I could see different about it was that it had red
&gt;paint (in 1990) that wasn't generally available until 1991, and that it had
&gt;the WLE emblems.  I even got a copy of the window sticker from the owner and
&gt;it does not even mentiuon WLE on th sticker.
 What color is your 1991?

        As matter of fact mine is Red too,

&gt;Perhaps VW just figured it was a good idea to slap a few WLE emblems on a few
&gt;vans???  :)&gt;I would dearly love to have a copy of your 1991 window
&gt;sticker.  Any chance
&gt;of mailing me a copy??

Joel opined that the &quot;dreaded PO&quot; did the actual spanking of Wolf Marks on
it. As of now I'm not in possession of the vehicle yet, long story, so If
there is an orignial window sticker I'll get that to you.  The sticker I
have is a 91 Carat from a previous &quot;deal&quot; that fell through.
