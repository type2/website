Subject: The Inuvik Run -- Whitehorse

The Inuvik Run -- At Whitehorse

July 26

Departed Laird Hot Springs about 0600.  Arrived in Whitehorse in
convoy with Ron Coyote, who left Laird at the same time and
quickly ran out of sight only to periodically reappear in my
rear-view mirror, the result of making stops along the way.  When
I drive, I drive.  418 miles, 8.2 hrs.  

Dennis departed earlier than me to insure arriving in time for
his girlfriend to catch her flight back to the states.  Ron and I
arrived at the Whitehorse airport in time to see her off then the
three of us convoyed into town and camped at the Sourdough RV
park, another pit.  Fifteen bucks Canuck for a slot in a gravel
parking lot.  Hook-ups can be hand at extra cost.  The only
saving grace is hot showers and flush toilets.  

John's reason for coming to Whitehorse instead of taking the
Campbell Highway to Faro has to do with his recalcitrant Apple
lap-top.  My car-battery-powered IBM-AT continues to work just
fine.  Fingers: Crossed.

In traveling to Whitehorse I'm skirting the borders of Beringia,
a mythical land some twenty million years old and one of the
reasons I chose to make this trip.  Beringia is that part of
North America that despite its high latitude was not buried under
a mile-thick glacier during the last Ice Age, the same continent-
wide mass of ice that created the American steppes and polished
Canada right down to its planetary basement-rock.  Yet even
though the Yukon Territory was just next door to the glacier, it
was not covered in ice.  This provided the land-route for the
second migration of humans and animals from the Asian mainland,
the folks we now call Indians;  Aborigines in Canuck-speak.

You can't do much field geology whizzing past at fifty miles per
hour but this is my first opportunity to see with my own eyes
what I've heretofore experienced only in books.  And yes, even at
fifty miles an hour the visual experience is enough to cause
things to click into focus.  It is a very exciting time for me.

I spent the shank of the evening helping Dennis install a CB
radio in his Westy, loaning my baking pan as a temporary magnetic
ground plane.  We glued the baking pan in the forward recess of
the fiberglass top, snaked the wires thru the gap in the door
seal instead of drilling holes.  He has a couple of other needed
repairs that we'll get to tomorrow.  While he did laundry,
including some of mine, I fixed chow.  At home I am not allowed
near the washing machine.  I am not allowed to Sort.  I am not
allowed to touch Bleach.  The ability to do laundry without turning 
white things pink and losing socks is a missing gene in my make-
up.  But I can cook, sorta.  I prepared ravioli with garlic toast
and buttered canned corn, followed by hot cocoa.  Dennis had no
complaints.

After pulling into the RV park and taking our spaces, Dennis went
downtown to buy a CB at Radio Shack.  While he was gone a
Canadian couple arrived and after a jockeying around, backed into
his space.  I explained that it was taken and they said, yes it
was, by them, since I had taken THEIR space.  And they had the
receipt to prove it.  Sure enough, their receipt had the number
of my space.  I told them the clerk must have made a mistake and
went to find my receipt.  And couldn't find it.  After a few
minutes they began to set up camp in Dennis' space, assuming I
was bullshitting them about the error.  I tore the bus apart and
finally found the receipt in my log book.  They spent some time
comparing the two identical receipts then pointed out that the
number of the space on my receipt was written in PENCIL whereas
theirs was written in ink and perhaps we should all go up to the
office to straighten things out.  The implication pushed the
wrong button.  I politely explained how I would straighten THEM
out if they didn't pack up their junk and get out of Dennis'
space RIGHT NOW.  They drove up to the office and later appeared
on the far, FAR side of the RV park.  Next thing you know they
would accuse me of having a printing press in the back of the
bus.  The number of my space?  13

Like most RV parks, the typical 'camper' is elderly and appears
to be a semi-permanent resident.  They all seem to know one
another.  There is a gang of eight geezers that kept me
entertained all afternoon.  They carry a picnic table about with
them as they march from one RV to another, since the spaces here
do not have individual picnic tables.  Nor fire rings.  Nor water
faucets.  Nor privacy.  I am within inches of a public sidewalk,
within feet of a main street.  And the sun refuses to die a
natural death.  The patrons of a Pizza Hut peer out their windows
into mine.  I smile &amp; wave.  They ignore me.

When the Gang of Eight go for a hike, the men, all in their
sixties, take up positions at the corners of the picnic table,
hoisting it up on a command from their Sergeant Major and go
shuffling off to their next gig, often only twenty feet away from
their last one.  Their wives shuffle along behind, also two x
two, shuffling so as not to overtake the table-carriers.  I've no
idea why they don't walk alongside or even -- gasp! -- go ahead
on their own, perhaps to welcome their arrival.  

The table-shufflers look a bit like a funeral procession, what
with the women carrying various table-top paraphernalia --
mosquito lamps, cribbage boards, place mats and so forth. 
Watching them shuffle back and forth, trying to achieve the
perfect position, all the while directed by the four women, was
hilarious.  Little puffs of dust rose up around the men's feet as
they shifted into half-step, backing and filling as if parking a
big rig in a narrow loading-bay.

I can't help but wonder if the Gang of Eight has similar lock-
step procedures for shopping, doing their laundry, going to the
bathroom and making love.  When they took up their positions for
their third Table Run in as many hours I felt an insane urge to
whip out my kazoo and play a bit of Sousa.  Or perhaps a polka. 
Ah one anna two...!

I've been on the road nine days, averaging six hours sleep a
night.  Things are starting to get silly.  And what's wrong with
the sun?

(after-trip comments:)

I never saw my baking pan again, meaning no more biscuits for the
remainder of the trip.  It was a pretty good baking pan.  No
holes and only a little rust.  It also serves as my parts-washing
pan, should I need to degrease something.  (You line it with
aluminum foil for baking.)

There were several guitars among the Inuvikerrs but I had the
only kazoo.  And a Spanish-language dictionary. - rsh
