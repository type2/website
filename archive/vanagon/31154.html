On the way to work this AM, going down 50, my bus kinda started losing
power.  It couldn't quite get up to its cruising speed, and when I went
up small hills, it lost speed, and didn't pick it up on the downside!

I eventually got down to about 45MPG before I could get off, and then
pulled off the freeway.

Everything looked normal, engine was cool, had gas (full tank) etc,
so I changed the fuel filter and that seemed to fix the power problem
once I got under way again.

Then on the way home, it did it again.  Now i was stumped.  When I got 
down to about 40, I stomped the pedal up and down a couple of times in
a hissy fit, and the bus took off!  

I think the governor is sticking or sumptin'  - its been really really
cold lately, like in the mid to low '50s (&lt;--- flame bait)  I don't
know what I can do about it, 'cept maybe re-grease the governor.

Any ideas?

Thom
