Subject: 76 T2: How to remove/install door panels?

How are the window roller and the door latch removed from 
the inside panel on a '76?

My '69 bug used to have a screw
head hidden by the center bit on the handle, this is one solid
piece.

The latch looks like it's stationary, but the kind of cup
that fits behind it is loose and looks like it's meant to slip
off -- or is it just up a bit?

Thanks for any insights
