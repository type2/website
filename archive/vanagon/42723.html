Subject: opinions needed - to buy 70 westy or not?

I ran across a 70 westy (single cot in pop-up) in pieces but everything all 
seems to be there.  I haven't rebuilt a transporter before (have built 62 
corvette and made a baja) and would appreciate opinions on this year vs 
others, relative strengths, good year for trannies? etc

it comes with an engine out of a bug (1600 I believe) - in pictures of that 
year the cooling tin seems close to a bug's - can I  use the bug engine?

The body is good but rust on rockers and behind wheels (snow salt?) I see in 
rocky mountain motors replacement body panels - how involved - anyone done 
it?

How much would you pay for it?

thx - clent
