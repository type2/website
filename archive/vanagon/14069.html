&gt; ok vanagon owners, i know the vanagon is not tops in performance but i am 
&gt; wondering, if i load one down, will its performance SERIOUSLY decrease or is 
&gt; it not really noticable?  im talking about 4 people total and luggage.  Does 
&gt; a westfalia package add alot of power robbing weight? Lastly, will i be able 
&gt; to climb a hill in a loaded vanagon, i have heard bad stories about 
&gt; insufficient power, im not interested in flying up a hill but i do want to 
&gt; climb it in a reasonable amount of time.

My roommate's empty 73 bus will run circles around my heavily loaded 73 (
batteries, fridge, stove, bubble top, etc).  It makes quite a difference,
at least in this case.  On the other hand, I can't tell much difference in
my bus when there is just me compared to hauling around 600 lbs worth of
extra people like I did yesterday.  Except that it is a little harder to
steer at slow speeds.  As for power, the Vanagons don't have a lot.  I
would expect that with a loaded Westy there would be a lot of hills you
would have to go up in 3rd gear.
