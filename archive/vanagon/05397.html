Okay, gang, another Vanagon List First! from Will Self,
THE VANAGON LIMERICK CORNER
Send your contributions to this LISTSERV address!  Keep them reasonably
clean, please.  You can include flannel, but no racier than that.  They
ought to have something remotely to do with Volkswagens, I suppose.
Kicking things off--


A fellow who lived down in Dixie
Flew his Volkswagen bus to Biloxi
He landed okay
But then blew it away
For he hadn't yet learned how to taxi


Well, ahem, I'm sure you can do better than that....

Will in Montana
