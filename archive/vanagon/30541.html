Subject:       Gas Heater Thermostat

I have a gas heater in my '71 that looks like a factory installation, 
but I can't find a manufacturer's name or model # anywhere, so I'm 
not exactly sure what I have.  It's a grey clyinder about 15&quot; - 
18&quot; long, and 6&quot; in diameter with a piece of sheet metal 
across the top that looks to have a reddish orange switch or 
somthing on it.  There is no thermostat; I just have the 
&quot;Temp&quot; knob on the dash.  The heater is mounted inside the 
engine compartment, and it vents to the passenger compartment.  It 
does not have it's own fuel pump (gets fuel from a T connector from 
the engine fuel pump), and I'm not aware of any coil to give it spark. 
It looks entirely self contained.  

My questions are:

A)  What do I have???

B)  Is there any way to adjust the temperature?

C)  What is the little orange switch/knob for?

Thanks for any responses/help on this.  I really appreciate the help!

Shaun
