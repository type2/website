I'll get in on the bra issue.

Mom's '90 Passat, still origional paint, clearcoated grey metallic.
Washed, not that often, often has severe dirt and crap under the bra
edge.  Finish under the bra is still much nicer than rest of the hood.
Bra is Whitless $45 on sale.

On '86 Vanagon, similarly owned Whitless bra (still have it if
someone wants to make an offer, some tears though and pretty
worn).  CONSIDERABLY HELPS A VAN NOSE.  I woiuldn't go out without
one on a Vanagon or Bus with nice paint.

Whitless bra on '89 Jetta, never fit for shit, the only one that didn't
fine with origional paint, killed the repaint Dupont.

Corrado factory bra bought second hand, is simply incredible quality but
origional price momentous.  Stil, fit and quality is perfect.

I say buy them, Whitless is fine for the price.
