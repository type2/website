Subject: Spelling

Ok, I know this is going to seem pretty anal, but &quot;Westfalia&quot; 
is spelled with a f, not a ph.  I seem to be seeing a lot of &quot;Westphalia&quot; 
written on this list.  I know it isn't a big deal, but we should at 
least be spelling the name of our vehicles correctly.

That's it, feel free to comment on this if I'm being too 
obsessive/compulsive.
