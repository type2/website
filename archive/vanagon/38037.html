&gt; 
&gt; Know what I want? Package shelf. It's really the only thing I envy in
Splits
&gt; except the swinging doors. The package shelf is useful, the space is
otherwise
&gt; wasted, and no way could you do it in a front-engine. I will never
understand
&gt; why they dropped it.
&gt; 
&gt; I got all excited about your plywood offer until I thought about how
&gt; prohibitive it would be to ship that stuff around. Thanks anyway, though.

I agree, a package shelf under the dash would be great for us breadloafers!

Could you market/distribute a paper pattern instead of the final product? 
This could be folded and put in an envelope, and
with this and a jigsaw we could cut out our own in minuites.

If you do this, I'll take pictures of and describe my $15 awning that works
great....
