Hi Volks,

We just bought a 85 westy a few weeks ago and love it!  Our son has 
78 green westy and showed us the joys of  camping via westfalia. My 
husband took it to Florida for the sailboat show in Tampa and got 22-
23 mpg. not too bad for an engine with 97000 miles on it.  We pay 
about $323.00 per year for full coverage here in Ohio, of course we 
have several other cars.    One problem we are having, is the heater 
blower has suddenly started making a nasty whistling noise. Any 
solutions?

Karen
