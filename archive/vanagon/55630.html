	It WAS too good to be true :(

Little cars are going back to Mexico due to govt. saftey standards, feds
did
the bust, a nurse at Thomas husband works for importation and she heard
you
and I talking about them and told her husband, there are 23 loose in the
US
and the feds mean to track 'um down and capture them, if we had bought
them
too bad.  But I loved the idea of a NEW Beetle.  The ones due here in 98
will
be water cooled front engines and not really the same at all.  I might buy
myself a restored one, now I've got the fever.  Later
