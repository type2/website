Subject: Engine In!

Finally the engine is in!  Over the weekend I put the gas tank (with new
sending unit) and firewall back in, and cleaned up the gas heater.  Last
night I levered the engine into position and bolted it into place.  It's  a
pretty tight squeeze getting it in there  - why on earth did VW start
welding the rear aprons into place instead of being able to unbolt them
like in the 68-71?  Is there any reason I shouldn't take a jig saw and cut
the rear apron out and then bolt it back into place - It would make taking
the engine out a LOT easier.  Is  the rear apron an important strucural
member?
