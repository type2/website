Subject: Re:  CT Syncro Connection

Derek,

I live just north east of hartford.  The problem with my van is that is is
running real rich.  I've replaced all the sensors with the exception of the
air temp sensor which is located in the air flow box.  The local vw mechanic
seems to think the problem is with the box itself.  I've measured the voltage
at the O2 sensor and have found it to be around 0.8 to 0.9 volts, which is at
the max upper limit  of richness!!. Adjusting the C0 screw to lean out the
mixture does nothing.  Also when checking the resistances of the meter
according to Bently everything seems fine, however, when i move the air flow
flap the change in resistance is not smooth.  it jumps all over the place.
 possible other problems may include, bad fuel pressure regulator, injectors,
or computer.  the dealer said the computer is fine.  Anyway, because the car
runs so rich, the O2 sensor tries to compensate and really leans out the
mixture causing a rough idle.  any input???

thanks
