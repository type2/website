Subject:      Diesel Wasserboxer

I wonder if you could answer a Vanagon question. A couple months ago I saw
a
posting on rec.autos.makers.vw.watercooled emphatically stating that diesel
wasserboxers were once available in Finland. Despite many, many hours of
searching and posting messages on newsgroups etc. I have been unable to
find
any references whatsoever about a diesel boxer. I do know that VW built a
few
aircooled prototypes in the early fifties but watercooled? I don't think
so.

Do you know the answer, or do you have an address for VW consumer inquires.
Any
help would be appreciated.

TIA
