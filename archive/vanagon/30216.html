Subject: Roof top storage box
Date: Wed, 06 Dec 1995 21:56:48 GMT

I have a 1990 Vanagon GL camper.  I am looking for a storage box to fit into
the rooftop depression at the front of the van.  The VW deal had a canvas type
bag which they wanted $250 which I didn't like.  Would like to know what is out
there, preferably in fiberglass.
