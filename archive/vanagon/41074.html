Subject: Re: Opinions on later models (vanagon/EV)

&gt; For those of you with '82+ vanagons and EV's, 

Okay as self proclaimed backup defender of the Eurovan....

&gt; Salesman. (his territory covers Miami to New Orleans to Raleigh/Durham)
&gt; 
&gt; High-mileage driver (55K+ per year)
&gt; 
&gt; Non-mechanic. (shade tree or otherwise)
&gt; 
&gt; His car needs include the ability to go long distances reliably, be
&gt; comfortable to drive long distances, must be air conditioned, std trans,
&gt; good gas mileage, and the ability to pack the thing with a large amount of
&gt; high bulk/low weight samples.  He would also like to have a hitch to tow his
&gt; (~21') Sea Pearl boat short distances.

Weight of the boat could be a problem.  Most hitches of the EV seem to be 
Class 2 (up to 3500 pounds).  I have no idea what a boat and trailer weigh.

Other than that the EV sounds like a decent match. As for CL/GL or MV, it
depends upon what he wants.
