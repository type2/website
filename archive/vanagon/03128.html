   Oh, alright.  You talked me into it, you silver tounged 
devil;  I'll come clean - '85 Vanagon, 55000 miles, 4 speed,
defunct ac.  Previously had a '67 bus (after market/home
built camper EXCELLENTLY done) sold it to my brother. Also
a '61 beetle I converted to 12 volt and installed a 1600 
single port engine - kept it till about 210,000 miles.  My
wife started complaining about the water coming inside when
we hit puddles; I had fixed this once before, but the rust
kept expanding, etc.  Also a '71 super beetle, now sold.  We 
keep the vehicles until they are pretty well worn out.  I do 
mechanical work, but not body work.  We are in Maryland, in a
surburb of Washington, DC, where we do sometimes get salt on 
the road.
