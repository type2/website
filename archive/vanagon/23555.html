Subject: RE: VW-Vanagon Mailing List Split?


&gt;I realize this might sound like heresy to some, and flame bait to others,
&gt;but has there ever been any consideration to splitting the &quot;vanagon&quot; list
&gt;into air-cooled and water-logged versions?  I know that many of the volks
&gt;have both types of busses but they could subscribe to both lists.  I also
&gt;know that much of the advice about camper accessories, proper tools,
&gt;engine fire stories, etc. may be of interest to both groups but that's
&gt;what cross-posting is for.  I guess I'm being selfish as it is tough to
&gt;wade through page after page of wasserbox mail to find anything to do
&gt;with my '71 Bus but....


Thanks for volunteering, Nick! Let us know when you've got the
new list running-- I'll be your first subscriber!

...glad I don't have to put up with the hassles of running a list  :)
