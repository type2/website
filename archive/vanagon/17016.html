Subject: how do I tow a bus?!?

I'm going to buy a bus that I've got to move about 250 miles....

I'd like to tow it with some sort of tow bar as my towing rig is not a 
class &quot;C&quot; and Uhaul won't rent me a trailer (It would probably be crazy 
to try and pull a trailer with a bolted-to-your-bumper hitch.(

Anyway, I've tried some of the VW speciality shops, and they tell me 
towbards for busses (I need to tow a 71 window van) aren't retailed any 
longer.

IS this true? I need to get one, or rent a tow bar that will do the job. 
Someone suggested that I get the tow bar for the beetle and then modify 
it. OK, but what do I do??

Suggestion appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Robb
