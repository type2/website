Subject: RE: traction? we donn need no stinkin traction ...

&gt;the 86 and the 88, however, would spin tires even on just wet grass. and in
&gt;the once-ever-five-years snowfall we get here,  it's just not a good idea
&gt;to ever stop moving. that seems to be the key: stopping deal still. as
long
&gt;as you can keep moving, it seems to be ok. but if you ever stop, it'll
spin.

&gt;anybody else?

Why do you think God made Syncros?
