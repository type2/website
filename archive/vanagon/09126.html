There is a tech note bulliten about some bolt back in there near the clutch
that shouldn't be torqued as tight as stated in the manual because the new
bolt supplied by the parts dept. won't take the stress. This tech note
supplies a new, lower, torque rating for said bolt. I cannot remember what
bolt this is now.

Just trying to make you good and comfortable Gerry.
