Subject: '93 eurovan computer has rs232

what i would like to know is how to access this computer.
i would like to monitor what's going on, but would prefer to be able to 
monitor AND modify.

maybe there's an ftp location for interface software. 

i have always had very good results with changeing my settings on my 
buicks, caddies, and other automobiles over the years to fit my STYLE of 
driveing.

i am particularly disatisfied with the shifting characteristics of the 
automatic transmission, but i would also like to modify fuel mixture and 
timing curves.

like i said before, i have done this before and i am more than a little 
irritated that i did not check into this before i decided to buy this van.

other than not being able to adjust the power train to my likeing, i like
the van quite a bit. it handles well, the wind dosn't seem to be much of a
problem, and i realy love the tight turning radius. of course i'm used to
some rather large cars when it comes to turning radius, so it may not
mean that much to people used to driveing a bug, or civic.

the best part is that it doesn't need the roof raised to accomodate a 
wheelchair. very well done guys.
