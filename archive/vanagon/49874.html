&gt;on a camping trip to Mammoth Lakes, CA, i ran into this older fellow who
&gt;said he and his wife were wanting to sell their vw's. they live in Bishop,
&gt;CA.
&gt;
&gt;1972 Bus, 7-passenger,
&gt;     Sierra Yellow/White top, extremely good body condition (the ONLY
&gt;     detraction was the sand pitting on the front &quot;face&quot;). all the glass,
&gt;     rubber, chrome, etc. is in excellent shape. even the interior, seats,
&gt;     rubber mats, and especially the headliner are in almost showroom
&gt;     condition. the bus looks no more than a year or two old.
&gt;     124,000 miles. factory rebuilt engine (20,000 miles ago). owner's
&gt;     manual and a little vw owner-fixit manual that i'd never seen before.
&gt;     original dual carbs, oil bath air filter. good wheels and tires.
&gt;     i did NOT drive the bus, so i can't say how it ran or stopped. but if
&gt;     any of you know the Mammoth Lakes area, he made it down to and back
&gt;     out of the Devil's Postpile area. :)

I saw this bus too, and talked to the owner at length about it.

Positives:

Not a spot of rust.  All floors have perfect, shiny off-white paint.
Roof is also perfect - was always garaged.
Upholstery flawless
Headliner flawless
Comes with an extra set of Solex carbs

Negatives:

It's not a camper
Small scrape/dent on right rear about 4&quot; square
Some loose wiring under the dash (no big deal)
Heavily pockmarked paint on the nose of the bus
Engine running rough - won't idle
Engine and tranny wet with oil and caked with dirt on bottom.

The negatives are probably all minor, except the first one.  With a little
TLC, this could be one heck of a show-winning bus!  I don't know exactly
how much he is asking, but I got the impression the asking price would be
considerably less than that of one now-notorious 74/75 Camper.

Oh, I have to put in my two cents about an $800 brake job.  That is an
incredible amount of money, even if you had to replace everything.  Rotors
are $100/pair brand new, pads $20.  I've heard of people paying $300 for a
full brake job and I thought that was horrible.  $800 just blows my mind!
Even if I couldn't do the work myself, I'd shop around a little before
paying that kind of $$.  Ouch.  As for the $2800 (I think) engine, that's
not too far out of line, assuming it was installed for that price.  Not
cheap, but not too far above retail.
