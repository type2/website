Hi,
	Last night I cut away the driver's side bellypan, or what
was left of it, and the lower portion of the driver's side outer rocker
panel.  The belly pan was something a PO had welded on, something like 
1/16&quot; or so steel sheeting, with several plates welded together to
form a crude pan.  I cut the rivets out of the faux outer rocker to
reveal the original one.  Oye.  It seems they made the situation worse
by riveting on pieces of sheet metal (without cutting away the stuff
underneath) because it just held the water in!

	I cut this stuff with my die grinder and these thin cutting
wheels I got last night. Works OK on the thin stuff, takes a bit longer
on the thick bits, but does not distort the metal at all, which is nice.
Anyone have any ideas on cutting tools for tight areas?  I will be having
to cut some of the welds underneath the bus in order to replace the beams,
and there's some tight spaces...

	Most of the rocker area has been liberally coated with BOR-30.
Thats Bondo Over Rust, 30 years old.   Since this bus was last registered
in '69, I figure it sat for most of the last 27 years or so, and that
these &quot;repairs&quot; were effected prolly 30 years or more ago.  The bus has
an auspicious age, though: 42.  I guess everyone got caught up in the
summer of love and forgot about this bus...
