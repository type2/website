Two questions....

1. Joel, do you scan these articles in, or do you &quot;hunt &amp; peck&quot;?
(hint....becareful...what you say might be sent to the govenor
of Allybammah   ;-)

2. As Winnebago aparently uses the front end of the EV...does that
mean the chop off the ass-ends and can them, or do they buy
EV &quot;noses&quot;?
