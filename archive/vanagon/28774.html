Subject: '56 Progress - front carpet
Date: Mon, 13 Nov 1995 10:40:59 -0800 (PST)


This weekend I put new carpet in the front of my bus.  I used that chopped
foam padding and some nice indoor/outdoor type capeting (already have it
in the cargo area)

This quited down the bus by about 25-30%, if you can believe it!  I can't
really tell what its done for it heat-wise yet, but it had to have helped.
I still have to finish some trim, I mean trimming.

The last big noisemaker I have to take care of is the solid tranny mount.
Anyone have any eperience with an early mount conversion piece that wasn't
solid?  I'm thinking about buying one and modifying it, cutting a slice out
of it an putting in a piece of rubber instead...
