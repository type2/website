Subject: Tires still again

I've worn out the latest set of Michelin XZX 185R14 Reinforced tires on my
85 Vanagon GL. The local distributor seems to think these are no longer
available. Anyone know if that's true? Also the Michelin book shows an XC4S
which comes as a 185R14 designated for &quot;Vanagons&quot;. Anyone try these yet?

My Bentley is the old 80-85 edition and shows the rim size for the 185R14 as
5-1/2 J 14. Is this same rim used on the post 86 Vanagons with the 205
series tires?
