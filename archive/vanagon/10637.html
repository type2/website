Subject:       I got it!

I am now in possesion of the '87 Westy!  (that would be *2* vans for 
me now, I fear myself slipping deeper into the abyss)

Here's the scoop for those interested:
-'87 Westy GL, Titan Red (wow, is it red) with grey interior, 
-manual/ac/power&amp;heated mirrors
-compression 140,130,140,145;  all service records from dealer
-160K miles but used for work on long business trips
-DRY underside(!) in terms of oil but owner reports slight head 
seeping, I haven't noticed it yet.
-Exterior excellent, interior excellent but needs a shampoo-ing
-needs exhaust but very drivable
-runs great, uses no oil, 20.4 mpg on way home

oh yeah, the price-- well, I feel good about it, the rest may think I 
paid too much but it was $4,200.

I thank all you fine people for responding to my questions on buying 
vans and in particular on the heartfelt responses so many of you gave 
when I asked if I should sell my Norton and get another VW...  the 
Norton stays!!!! Thank you.

Actually, I will be selling my '85 Weekender in the near future to 
finance the '87.  After observing all the threads on the heater 
problems with the aircooleds, I decided to stay with water.  Heat is 
literally a life or death issue in a location where each winter gets 
down to -40 degrees F (that would also be -40 C).  As much as I like 
the romance of the idea of a '71 Westy, it just isn't practical up 
here.
