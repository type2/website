Subject: Re: Cargo Floor Liner

&gt; Hey, what are the cargo floor dimensions of the Vanagon? Wolfsburg West is
&gt; repro-ing the black rubber cargo floor mats for the '50-'79 buses without
&gt; holes for the middle seat (leave solid or cut your own) This might be a
&gt; possibility seeing if WCM or someone would be interested in repro-ing the
&gt; rubber cargo floor mats used in the standard non-GL Vanagons and Vanagon
&gt; Kombis.  I have the front cab floor rubber mat out of a '80 Vanagon Kombi.
&gt; Easy to clean, and lasts a whole lot longer than carpet.
&gt;
My Kombi's front mats are really quite slippery, especially the area in the 
walk-through which is kind of hard-ish plastic, not rubber.  The cargo bed 
mats I've seen have molded undersides to provide a reasonably smooth
floor.  It would be nice to have the whole cargo mat, a single piece from
front seats to rear hatch, although mine would need a cut-out for the engine
ECU.  Were these available in Europe or Canada?  They never brought Kombis
or Panels to the US, so even asking a dealer doesn't work.  I asked a Canadian
dealer, but they showned only Vanagon parts -- nothing for Kombis or Panels.

I would love one of these, if any of our non-US members can get them.
