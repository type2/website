Subject: bustenhalter fur busen (bras for buses)

So Joel Walker says:
&gt; ok, so we got YoMama who makes bras for 1950-1967 ... anybody got any
&gt; sources for bras for 1968-1979 buses, 1980-1991 vanagons, and 1991-&gt; eurovans?

I just picked up my second Autobahn bra from the dealer for about $90. (OUCH!)
But I like the style and don't know where else to get them.

Really helps keep the front of 'The Beast' from sagging. ;)
