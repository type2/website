 SyncroBeast           re&gt; cup holders
To Jim Thompson and listees.

You know, I'd be interested in seeing this accessory cup/change/small stuff
holder mentioned.  It sounds interesting.  I asked my friendly local parts
gnomes, and they remember it.  It would have to be something that would mount
on the dash of my `89 SyncroBeast, though.

  Jim T, please keep us posted as to when you get a photo up on your web site.


As far as the other Vanagon cupholder mentioned in this thread, found mounted
in ?some? - ?all? - ?several? Vanagon versions, here is some usefull
information.

VW sells the originals for - oh say $30 or so, maybe $40, I forget.  You can
also buy these repro's at a lot of the VW dealers for $10.  I've seen them at
both West Side VW and Burnsville VW here in the Twin Cities, MN.

The manufacturer of the repro's sells them for $5.  I called him Thursday.  He
is not set up to handle single item orders, but was open to volume quantity
purchases.  i.e., don't spread his name and number all over, organize a group
buy and he will deal.  (Hence, I didn't drop his name here.)  I did not ask
about quantity pricing.

I looked on several of both original, and repro copies that I have, and saw no
VW or other part numbers.  I believe it was the repro's that said &quot;made in
Taiwan R.O.C.&quot;. They are very nice, and the repro comes in two versions.  One
fits only pop cans, it has a top circle connected all around.  The other has a
top circle split in the middle to accomodate coffee cup handles.  I believe it
is slightly larger.

Experience says that they can break, usually at the hinge point on the bottom
tray.  I have them mounted in all the normal Vanagon positions, and also in my
GTI on the dash just below the dash vents, left and right.  I've popped the
GTI units with my knee getting in a couple of times, and busted one or two.  I
believe I may have busted one of the units mounted near the floor of the
Vanagon in the front to back pass thru.

Again, they do work very nice.  The only modification I have made to mine was
to add a soft foam cushion (1/8 inch thick, closed cell, double sided stickeey
tape)  to the bottom to keep pop cans from rattling.

So:

If someone in a position to do volume quantity buys is interested, e-mail me.
I'll let you know the phone number and manufacturer.  It sounds like these
things are available several places now.

TIA
