Subject: Re: Gasoline difference

Speaking of alcohol in the gas tank, a mechanic in Montana of all places... 
told me that this is good stuff to have in the Winter (because it 
prevents condensation) but not in the summer where it is more likley to 
vaporize at a lower temp leading to vapour lock. Our experience in 
running it in CAL during the summer of last year was not a good one, 
stumbling, run-on etc. Unfortunately gasahol is unavailable in Ontario (I 
think) so it would be hard to test during the winter. DC
