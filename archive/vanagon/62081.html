Subject: RE: EV Mirror Questions

Ken,

The EV mirror mounts are rather complex. The mirror part mounts with tension 
springs to the bracket on the car, one spring through each of the two &quot;arms&quot; 
going to the bracket. I had a spring come unhooked on the top driver's side 
mirror (cracked die casting) - and had a time pulling the spring out to 
reconnect it. If the main body of the bracket itself is broken I wouldn't 
think a fix is really feasible. If it's just loose, maybe the spring unhooked.

The mirrors come off easily enough - pull the interior panels (easier than a 
Vanagon - 3 screws on the arm rest handle, one top front, one snap-on at the 
top rear, undo the lock button, then list up the whole panel) and unplug the 
wiring harness. Then 3 screws on the mirror and work out the foam block.

Haven't seen a manual yet - Bentley has a website and they still make no 
mention. Sure would like one tho.

&gt;Hello All,

&gt;Someone or something bumped and broke the lower 1/2 of the bracket to my
&gt;passenger side mirror.  Anybody been there, done that yet?  It's always
&gt;nice to get some info before diving into a project cold.  Also on that note
&gt;does anyone have info on a shop manual yet?  Bentley or even Haynes?  I'd
&gt;think that you could get a UK version at least since the vans have been out
&gt;for a number of years on the other side of the pond.

&gt;Thanks

Ken
