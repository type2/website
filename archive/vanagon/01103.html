more to worry about

the catalytics heaters turn LP into CO2 and H2O = as with any process
nothing is perfect so some CO will be generated. My guess is you get 
exposed to more CO from your exhaust (even in perfect condition) than from
the heater - thats only a guess though.

Using it all night while you sleep (Joel?) worries me more - if the heater
'goes out' - unless there are 'flame switch' safeguards - it continues to
pump out propane which will snuff out. All of this is irrelevant if the
heater vents combustion gases outside - probably a good idea.

I used to use a Sears 10kBtu propane heater in my 71 - one day I came out
to find my entire bus was filled with propane because the valve had 
not been closed tightly ... carefully opened windows, doors and let it
air out for 30 minutes - from then on i never left the cylinder connected
when the heater wasnt in in use.

i hate being an alarmist but i wouldnt use an unvented propane heater
while i slept again - your mileage may vary.

still hoping to fix my diesel heater under the floor this summer ....

sps
