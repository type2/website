Subject: RE: 5 speed Vanagon

&gt;I was just going through the  gopher FAQs and found them very informative.
if
&gt;you are interested in finding out where your Van  was made check out
&gt;the FAQ on VINs. Anyway I noticed that many of the later synchros and
&gt;diesels? were equipped with 5 speed transmissions. Would it be wise to
&gt;install one in a four speed system?

My Syncro has a 5-speed, but it's probably not the 5-speed you're looking
for.

Below reverse in the shift pattern is an additional ultra low forward gear
(often called a &quot;granny gear&quot; for reasons unbeknownst to me) for cliff
climbing, bog wading, sand duning, etc. You hit 4000 RPM at about 8-10 mph,
so we are talking serious torque action here. I imagine that the same unit
is installed on diesels to allow them to be at least conceptually driveable
in places like San Franciso, though I wouldn't want to be stuck behind one.

In any case, you have to push down to get to the gear - just as for reverse
- so it's not really useable as an additional regular drive gear.
