&gt;My acclerator cable is sticking when it is cold...Last year it never did

&gt;How do I fix it?  Is there a lubricant that can be applied with cable still

You didn't mention what year Vanagon, but I had the same problem w/my '87.
It was cured completely with replacement with the upgraded cable.  VW didn't
change the part number, but (per tech info #90-01) &quot;...a modified
accelerator cable has been introduced which can be identified by a white
plastic sheath enclosing the entire length of the braided cable...&quot;  Takes ~
an hour to replace, been smooth as silk for 2 years now.
