&gt; I don't think that posts such as the one that follows here are necessary
  or appropriate. If someone is mistaken, they can be corrected without being
  humiliated. Other egos who pump themselves up by stepping on the backs of
  others that they will never encounter face to face can be located on the 
  landrover list if this is a sport that you enjoy.

&gt; Mantis shows his ignorance of things VW in the following ways:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. His comment re: Eurovans not looking like nothing more than a
&gt; Dodge Caravan....obviously the only similarity is that both have
&gt; the letters &quot;v...a...n&quot; in their names...
&gt; 
&gt; 2. His almost purchasing a 1990 vanagon with a 5 cylinder engine while
&gt; in college...Wow...a flat 5 what a concept...what did it have...three
&gt; cylinders on one side of the engine, and two on the other...perhaps
&gt; some one stuffed an old Ranger 5-cylinder radial from a Waco biplane
&gt; in the back of a 90 Vanagon....
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry Mantis...no five cylinder vanagons...no matter how footed in
&gt; reality...or dream world you are...sorry...no cigar!
