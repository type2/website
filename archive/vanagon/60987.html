Subject: Rear wiper - continued

I wrote before about the rear wiper in my '88 Vanagon not working. I managed
to drag out the shop manual, and cursing the &quot;new style&quot; wiring diagram. (I
miss the old style Bently with the fold out diagrams in color!)  I discovered
that there are two relays for the wipers. My first thought to test the rear
wiper relay was to get a piece of wire with blade connectors at each end and
connect terminals 53 and 15 on the relay - figuring that this should send
power to the rear wiper. (I verified that there was 12V at one terminal)

Well, nothing happened, so either I'm reading the wiring diagram wrong, or
the problem is in the rear wiper motor of wiring.  If there is any interest,
I'll be happy to post my findings since there is nothing in the shop manual
about diagnosing this problem.
