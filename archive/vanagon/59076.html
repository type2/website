Subject: problems with new Eurovan

Can anyone advise on two problems discovered on the first trip in my brand
new 96 Eurovan?

With the liftgate (the Winnebago manual's word for what the VW manual refers
to as the rear lid) open in the rain, water dripped through the vinyl plug
opening just above the strap and soaked into the lining material.  I
couldn't tell if the water entered around the embossed VW symbol or from
around the number plate.  Anyone solved this one?  Does the inside of the
liftgate be dried out in some way?

THe channel in which the sliding door runs does not drain.  There is a drain
hole at the rear end of the channel but not at the front. It seems to me VW
forgot to drill one little hole.

Yes it is under warrenty, but a regular VW dealer is much more convenient to
get to than the Eurovn dealer and I don't know how familiar they will be
with the Eurovans.
