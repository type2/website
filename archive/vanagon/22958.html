Subject: Re: The Silver Socket is a factory option, M***, I think, Adverse Condtions questions

Possibly we/you/I could ask VWOA about more info regarding the &quot;M&quot; number.



&gt;	I got a copy of Tobin Copley's find, &quot;Driving In Adverse Conditions&quot;
&gt;by VAG- it gives an M number for a dashboard powersocket- the dread 
&gt;Silver Socket? Its a factory option- it was never clear to me if it
&gt;took a special plug (DIN?) or a cigaret lighter plug... anyway, Martha's
&gt;got one, that thing. Its recomended for adverse conditions, though
&gt;they don't say why. Perhaps for the hand held spotlight or additional
&gt;air-blower they also recomend.
&gt;
&gt;	Is this something everyone else knew? I can bring in the M
&gt;number tomorrow if it matters. (We're hardly going to be ordering
&gt;new Vanagons from the factory, alas.) 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;	The same document recomends&quot;Anti Dazzle Strips&quot;, being
&gt;affixed to the inside of the windshield, and not legal for vehicles
&gt;operated in the Federal Republic of Germany (as it was then). Anyone
&gt;have a clue what these are? 
&gt;	Could they be something to encourage your irises to contract,
&gt;like a reflective tape or light-colored or phosphorescent object
&gt;placed in the periphery of the driver's vision path? 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;	Finally, the document (this is starting to sound like The
&gt;Celistine Prophesy...) describes rubber-bag car-jacks, operated
&gt;by engine exhaust. Lay it under the car, connect to the exhaust,
&gt;run engine, raise car, close valve, change tire or whatever. 
&gt;Sylvia Plath jokes optional. A regular jack is certainly simpler,
&gt;probably faster and likely safer, but what a cool idea! Has anyone
&gt;ever seen one for sale?
