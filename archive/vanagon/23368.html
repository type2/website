Subject: Generator light...meaning?


The following pertains to my '66 Westy.

I've now hooked up a second battery thru a battery isolator and yesterday,
while driving home at night, noticed that my generator light was on 
faintly. Interestingly, it seemed to get brighter when I was stepping
on the gas (while idling).  During the drive home it stayed pretty
constant (albeit faint).

Today, (this morning) I could not detect that it was on (this does not 
neccessarily mean it was off tho due to the ambient light).

I understand that when the light is _ON_, as in very bright, no battery
charging is taking place.  What does it mean when it is a little bit on?

Thanks,
...Markus
