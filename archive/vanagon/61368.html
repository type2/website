Subject: Re: Dometic - Have Flame - No Cooling

Help please for me also!     I just uncovered the same problem (thought
when I got it to light the problems were over.

On mine, with 110v or 12v, cooling is adequate and the box eventually gets
down to ~30 deg F.
With Gas, the lowest it gets is ~50F (outside at 70).   This applies either
stopped on the level or in motion (12v or gas).   I'm going to take it out
and see if the orifice is restricted, but the burner sounds like it's doing
its thing when it's on, and there is heat.

Anyone have any ideas?

&gt;
&gt; I have an 83 Westy with a burdening fridge.  The 120V heater will cool   
&gt;the refrigerator adequately but the gas wont.  The gas burner will get   
&gt;the chimney much hotter than the 120V heater element but the fins in the   
&gt;box don't cool with gas.
&gt; As you can see my problem isn't that my burner wont light.  There is   
&gt;something else.  The refrigerator is level.  As I cried before, PLEASE   
&gt;HELP!
