Subject:       Re: '82 Diesel Westy Preventative Maintenance


&gt; I have an '82 diesel Westy with 35K miles, always garaged.  I got it from my
&gt; in-laws when it had about 30K miles.
&gt; A new head gasket was put on at about 29K miles.
&gt; I have done the normal oil, coolant, and filters type of maintenance.
&gt; What preventative maintenance should I perform??  Someone once suggested to me
&gt; to replace the head bolts with different/new head bolts which will not
&gt; &quot;stretch&quot;.  Anyone know about or recommend this?
I wouldn't bother unless the gasket fails, at which time you will 
need new bolts, either stretch type (~ $20/set), or Raceware (~ 
$150/set). I chose not to spend the money on stretch bolts, since in 
~ 400k of driving VW diesels, I've only had one head gasket fail (and 
it was minor - ran fine but leaked oil)
