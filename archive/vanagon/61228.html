Subject: hand brake rod problem &quot;solved&quot;

A while back I had asked for advice on removing the locking 
adjustment nut for the hand brake.  After much penetrant, working on 
it with a torch, etc. I bagged and had my FLIVWSS (friendly local 
independent VW service station) look at it while doing other stuff.  

Due to a slight communication error between the parts shop and the 
mechanic, he didn't know they had the rod assembly in stock.  So, he 
snapped off a few inches of the rod, threaded it, and added an 
extension.  Apparently there is a considerable amount of labor 
involved with making the connection up front above the fuel tank, so 
since he didn't have to do that, this may have been a cheaper 
solution.  Just wish I'd have thought of doing this before paying 
someone else to do it.

Nonetheless, the FLIVWSS (Bernhard's in Breinigsville, PA) have been 
quite good to me and seem to know what they're doing.

Oh yeah, and thanks to all of you, resetting the OXS light was a
snap.   Visually inspected the O2 sensor and it seems to be much 
newer than the rest of the exhaust.
