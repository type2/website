Subject: Dealing with rusty seams


                                 Rusty seams

Your bug or bus is stitched together by spot-welds.  It would be stronger and
less prone to rust if continuous welds were used but when dealing with sheet
metal, a continuous bead causes the light panels to distort.

To keep spot-welded seams from rusting, which they are prone to do, a bead of
caulking is smeared on the inner edges while lead, bondo or paint is used to
seal the outer edges.  If the seam was free of rust at the time it was
assembled, so long as the sealant remains intact the seam won't rust.  But
it's not uncommon to find rust under the paint on Volkswagens and that
includes rusty seams.  The stuff has been there since the vehicle was
assembled, just waiting for a chance to spread.

There are different kinds of rust.  A few ions of sodium from sea air or road
salt will act as a catalyst, drawing in the moisture needed to start the
rusting process.  And once started salt-induced rusting will continue until
the sodium is neutralized or removed -- sealing in the rust won't help.  This
means a good first step for dealing with rust is to add water (!).
 Hopefully, the water will carry away the salt, giving you a chance to deal
with the rust.

One of the handiest methods of dealing with rust is use a phosphoric acid
compound that will convert the ferrous oxide to ferric phosphate.  Black iron
oxide is a more stable form of rust.  Once sealed with paint a phosphated
surface is usually stable, the rust will not progress.  (I'm always getting
the ferrous/ferric thing mixed up.  A bit of help from the chemically adept
would be appreciated.)

When dealing with a rusty seam often times your only recourse is to use
chemicals but the most successful method is to remove the rust, weld the seam
closed and go on from there.

Bondo is polyester resin -- plastic -- mixed with fillers.  The most common
filler is sand although materials as diverse as talc, sawdust and glass beads
are also used.  Because of the fillers, bondo is permiable -- it isn't
waterproof.  Before using bondo to fill a seam or smooth a repair, the bare
metal surface should be treated with a phosphoric acid solution.  Failure to
observe this precaution often leads to the formation of rust under the bondo.
 In time, the rust will cause the bondo to crack and admit more moisture and
you'll be back here you started.  The fillers reduce the strength of
 polyester resin.  Use the thinnest possible layer.

The typical vehicle rusts almost as fast from the inside out as from the
outside in.  Once water gets into a vehicle it's surprisingly difficult to
get it all out.  And while most car owners are careful to deal with minor
rust on the exterior of their vehicle, few place the same importance on those
rusty spots lurking under the floor mat.  If you have a rusty seam you should
immediately check the other side of the seam.  In many cases, this is the
source of the moisture that has caused the rust.

Most car owners spend a lot of time making the visible portions of their
vehicle pretty but when it comes to rust protection the invisible portions,
such as the under-side, are of equal importance.  Anything that can hold
moisture next to the metal will promote rust and quickly, too.  Pressure
washing the under-side of your bug or bus can add decades to its life.  And
just as you should immediately deal with any stone chips on the body work, so
too should you care for the fender wells and frame members.

                                           Sermonette

It is the nature of cars to self-destruct due to rust; cars are
bio-degradeable.  We can stave off the process by sealing the metal from the
air using layers of paint, and protect the paint with layers of wax.  But if
we're serious about caring for our vehicles we must devote equal time to the
interior and underside.  The best rust treatment is prevention.
