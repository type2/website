     Just wanted to pass along an offer in the spirit of GHWB's Thousand 
     points of light
     
     Im nominally located in the eastern upstate NY (Albany) area, but my 
     job takes me (by car) to the six states of New England (CT VT NH ME RI 
     MA) every week.
     
     If you are checking out parts/cars and are serious in the this area, 
     let me know, I can check my schedule and let you know when Ill be 
     nearby for that third-party look.
     
     Payment: Do something in kind for the vanagon list group, or some 
     other group, or the kids, or whatever ....
