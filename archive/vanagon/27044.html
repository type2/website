&gt;
&gt;     People tend to drive maniacally here in San Diego, and
&gt;     inexplicably tailgate at all times. I'm about as patient
&gt;     as the next person, but there have been a few times when
&gt;     I'm a tad upset about having some jerk glued to my rear
&gt;     bumper AND I STAND ON THE F*****G BRAKES!!! Then give
&gt;     them a nice smile and wave, knowing that they've soiled
&gt;     their shorts in fear of running into me.

When I was moving out of my home country (NYC, NY), to parts much
less civilized (the burbs), friends told me of an easier way to lose 
tailgators.
Wait until they are inches from your bumper, steam coming from their ears,
eyes buggin out of their heads, on pull on my headlights.
This works great in the daytime, with nano-seconds to brake, they brake 
hard,
if they are wise to this trick, the third or fourth time really brake.  If 
you dont leave
rubber, you can Collect BIG.

Crash

Thank god for flashbacks, my memory really sucks.
