Will Self sez:

&gt; I propose 200 miles per day.  I would propose even less if I thought
&gt; people would accept it.
 
Of course, days might be variable in large degree.  In target rich areas
like, maybe, the Oregon coast or the Napa valley :-), 100 miles per day
might be OK.  In target poor areas, like, say, cantral Illinois, 500 miles
per day might be tolerable.

One more thing, probably an unpopular idea, but, I like to drive on back
roads mostly and avoid the interstates.  It is slower this way but you
get to see more stuff and you don't have to put up with the big trucks
blowing you off the road!

Cheers, and keep on trekkin!
