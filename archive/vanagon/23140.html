Subject: Inuvik Tour Roster (and invite!)

Sorry if this is a repeat for some or all of you: the freenet mail server 
died yesterday, leaving no trace of sent messages, and NO incoming mail 
ALL FRIDAY!  :(  :(  So here we go again...

The following is a list of the people who have indicated to me that they 
have some semi-serious interest in joining in on the as-yet-un-named trip 
to Inuvik, NWT, Canada (that's a few miles short of the Arctic Ocean, 
kids!) in August, 1996.  I haven't been very organized in how I keep 
track of people who tell me they're interested, so I'm sorry if I've 
missed you on this first list.  If I've missed you, contact me and I'll 
add you to the list.  

You'll see from the list below that all the people so far are from the 
west coast.  Well, hey, that's not right, so how about RENTING a westy 
here in Vancouver and taking that on the trip?  There are several places 
here in Vancouver that rent Eurovan Westies (you heard right--Westies!), 
and there's that place in Bellingham, WA that rents Vanagon Westies.  All 
you folks from elsewhere in North America (Europe?  Asia?  Oz?) might 
want to consider flying here (I'll pick you up from the airport in our 
westy--what style!) and renting a vehicle for the trip.  I can check out 
prices if there's any interest.

Still open to ideas for a tour name.  How about WATT: Western Arctic 
Transporter Tour?

The roster for the Inuvik trip (the WATT?) is open to any and all, of 
course, (providing you bring your bus!) so to all of you out there on 
the list: plead for the time off and get back to me.

Here's who I have in on this thing so far:

Me and my SO, Christa Ovenell	tobin_at_freenet.vancouver.bc_dot_ca	Definite
Martha &amp; Sarah Rubin (81 westy) busgirl_at_netcom_dot_com		Definite!
Ron Lussier (90 westy)		coyote_at_zuni.chaco_dot_com		Nearly definite
Bob Hoover (bus unknown)	Veedubber_at_aol_dot_com		Interested
Paul Uusitalo (with syncro!)	puusital_at_adobe_dot_com		  &quot;
Gregor (w Festus, the 74 bus)	GDURSTEW_at_oimb.uoregon_dot_edu	  &quot;
Bill Abbott (70 single cab)	wabbott_at_megatest_dot_com		  &quot;
Michael Wagner (76, good year)	mwagner_at_deltanet_dot_com		  &quot;

So looks like between 3 and 8 vehicles at this point!  Far better 
response than I'd expected!  The original post was sort of &quot;Christa and I 
are gonna drive up to Inuvik next summer, anyone want to join us?&quot; kinda 
post.  This is most cool.

You'll notice from the above list that there are no splits or E-van 
represented yet.  C'mon, people!  Are all the E'van people scared of 
scratching up their shiny paint?  Are all the splitties looking around 
for those spare motors they'll want to bring?

Join the fun!
