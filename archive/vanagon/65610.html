Hi,

in the cross fire i noticed a disparaging remark about MB drivers.

why?

I drive an aircooled 82 pop top van converted by Devon, we use it to play
out in, and it happily takes us to France, Belgium, Holland and weekend
trips. It does not take me to work my MB C220 does and its great. The first
thing i have to do when leaving home is climb 1000 ft, and its not fair to
the van, or my wallet to drive a 16mpg van in city traffic, when i
eventually get there.

MBs, like VW, last forever; few days ago met a man with 5 tonne MB van with
500,000 miles on and still going strong. Not the first and certainly not
the last.

keep on dubbin'

mick
