Subject: Cleaning Pop Top 

I recently purchased an '81 Westy.  The pop top's surface has small cracks 
all over on the finish.  Also it is grey from dirt.  Any suggestions on how 
to clean the top to get it back to its original white?   Also what can I put 
on the fiberglass top to keep it from getting dirty again soon?
