Subject: Interesting  VW Van info


Couldn't help but notice a number of ads for VW busses for sale in the
Truck Trader this week. I know we can't post ads themselves in the Vanagon
list.

If you want, Email me directly for info. Some are pretty low prices. No,
I'm not getting any $$ for this, and am not affiliated with Truck Trader,
its sister publications, its advertisers, or anyone else you might take 
offense at, so don't flame me over an innocent, trying-to-help-out post
for crying out loud.
