I guess your switch freezed to ON at your temperatures. It is on the
left side of the front part of the manual gearbox. Hammer slightly
against it or see was has happened. If you want to change it, take
care of the transmission oil, possibly it comes out of the hole.

I own a 1985 Panel camper and I my reverse light is stuck on. I got very
cooled here one night &quot;-40 C&quot; and when my wife went to work with the van I
noticed the reverse light was stuck on
