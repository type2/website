Well, I see Sergio is still whining.  Maybe if he pulled his head out of 
his arse long enough, he'd see that no vehicle is infalliable.  I drive 
my bus because it's a cool vehicle even as ugly as it is.  It's a vehicle 
with personality.  Do you think the Ford Aspire or Windstar has 
personality?

If you abhor VWs so much, why do you torture yourself by staying on the 
Vanagon list?
