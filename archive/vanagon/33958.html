&gt; &gt;&gt; Can someone tell me what a Newsgroup is?  Do you subscribe to a newsgroup
&gt; &gt;&gt; like a list?  If so, how, and is there one for Volks?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Did anyone ever answer this for you?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thom
&gt; 
&gt; Nope, I'm still confused as before.  Do you know the difference?

A &quot;newsgroup&quot; is one of approx 15,000 different subject sections in something
knows as USENET.  A news group is different from a mailing list in that 
posts are not sent to each persons mailbox.  Image a newsgroup as being
a community bulletin board where everyone sticks 3x5 cards onto with thumbtacks
while a mailing list (like this one) is an interactive magazine subscription,
where the magazine is sent to all the subscribers, and subscribers may
write back to the magazine if they choose, and all letters to the magazine
get published.

You don't really &quot;subscribe&quot; to a newsgroup, even though that is the term
people use.  You can lurk on a newsgroup and nobody will ever know of
your existence until you pipe up.  On a mailing list, there is a central 
control of the list so they know to send stuff to you. 

How to read newsgroups?  Well, since you're with AOL, I don't know - its 
built into the interface they give you, so you may wanna poke around with
it a bit.  I know there are other AOL people who post to newsgroups, so
I know it can be done.

There are a couple VW-related newsgroups: rec.autos.vw and 
rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled, and also rec.autos.makers.vw.watercooled 

Good luck.
