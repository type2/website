Fred,

I have installed about 6 cruise controls over the years and assisted with a 
few more.  Two of my installations were in buses.  I have a favorite kind 
but it has gone through several company ownership's and brand name changes. 
 It is currently being sold as AudioVox.

However, my latest installation experience was in 1988 with it being Zemco 
branded.  I have an AudioVox unit ready to install and can confirm it's the 
same generic because many of the clamps and brackets have stayed identical 
over the years.  The other telltale feature is that there is no clutch 
override switch.  The unit detects a rapid change in engine speed instead.

I tell you all this, because every one that I installed has been improved 
in some way over my previous experience.  Not in operation, these units 
have always performed flawlessly.  However, successive editions have become 
smaller and easier to install.  I assume that the current version will work 
as well as the others, but I may not get around to installing it for some 
time to confirm that.

I believe that one of the JCW models is the AudioVox, but you would have to 
confirm it with them.  They will also tell you that it can't be installed 
in your van.  The reason for this is that the engine, battery, and 
dashboard are all in the wrong places.  The solution is simply to extend 
the control wiring cable.  This is not a big deal if you are comfortable 
with splicing wires.

Cruise is a joy,
Mike
