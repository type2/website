Subject:      Re: Stainless Exhaust

Eric, and all others interested in the Stainless Exhaust.  It's being made
by STEBRO EXHAUST in Manotick, Ontario, Canada.  The system is not ready
for sale yet that I know of, but I haven't been in touch with STEBRO for a
couple of weeks.  At that time I was told the system would be ready for
sale in short while.  You can phone STEBRO at 613-692-4984 and talk to
Dan.  They have a web site but I don't have the address at hand.  Do a
search for STEBRO and you will find it.  They have an e-mail address also
which is on the web site when you get there.

Cheers

Frank
