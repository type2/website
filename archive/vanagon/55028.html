If you're talking about the ECU (the box mounted to the right of the 
engine bay with the big heavy black plug) then there's no way to check 
because the ECU has nothing to do with ignition, only FI.

You can check the Hall Control Unit with a voltmeter; the procedure is 
spelled out in all the manuals and runs to 7 or 8 steps.  If you don't 
have a manual, I can send you the step-by-step via p-email.

&gt; When the engine is running it works just fine-it purrs,
&gt; but intermittently it just dies-no sputters, no hiccups, no backfires it
&gt; just dies like I've turned the key off. anyway if you could help me with
&gt; the above questions it would be appreciated.

Somebody else's problem reminded me - you have checked for good tight 
connections at the battery?
