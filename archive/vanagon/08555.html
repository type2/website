&gt;My '87 Vanagon's accelerator lost half its range today.
  ... detailed description of Terrible Woes Inflicted Upon a Bus ...

one thing i've noticed was that the little 'accordian' rubber boot on the
accelerator cable cracks and opens up, exposing the cable itself to road
grime and whatever.  so i go to buy some new ones. you ready for this?
$10.20 each. and that was 2.5 years ago.

you see, i had forgotten about German rubber ... it's synthetic. not real
rubber. made outa gold. :)

anyhoo, it might be time to check that little rubber boot and replace it,
if it's cracked and deteriorated ... to keep more road salt and water and
'stuff' from getting down into the cable itself. couldn't hurt to squirt
a little lubricant down the cable before you put the new boot on. ;)
