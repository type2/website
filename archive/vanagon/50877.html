Subject: The Cooling Fan Won't Shut Off
Date: Fri, 25 Oct 96 09:42:00 E


I was driving in the Bronx last Saturday night during a gigantic rain   
storm.  I was forced to go through two deep puddles, probably covered the   
entire wheel if not 3\4 of it.

I then reached my destination, hung out for about 3 hours came back to   
start the van and nothing.  I also noticed that the cooling fan never   
shut off.  So, I took out fuse #7, walked to a Mexican restaurant in   
Manhattan, met Ethan Hawk( I was told he was an actor), and when I got   
back the starter engaged but the battery was too drained.  Got a jump and   
it started fine.

Four days later, the fan still refuses to shut off.  I have to remove   
fuse #7 to keep it from draining my battery.  I was thinking of just   
running two cables from the fuse connector, attach the fuse to one of the   
cables and VOILA! I have a switchable fan control.

Any suggestions?

BTW- keeping the fan on all the time sure keeps the engine nice and cool!
