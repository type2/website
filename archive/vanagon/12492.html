I still like the simplest approach best, a monochrome (white, orange,
yellow?) sticker with big bold black letters...

Something like:


&gt;        ------------------------------
&gt;        |  N E T S U R F N U G E N   |
&gt;        | vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu  |
&gt;        ------------------------------

Generic, I know.

A good graphic?  Perhaps the turtle with a number 2, but that symbol is
general enough to apply to all Folks with the box-like Volks.  It doesn't
seem special to this list to me.  This is because all we ever see on this
list, or any list, is text.  Or ascii graphics (still text-based).  Since
we never see graphical images, how can we ever agree on a suitable image,
or even identify with one?
