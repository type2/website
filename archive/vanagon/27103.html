&gt; Some thought on sandblasting.  I asked about bare metal resto of a porsche, 
&gt; sandblasting all the paint off.  It is better to get it tanked clean after 
&gt; paint stipping the worst off (tanking is not a backyard job!) Sandblasting 
&gt; the surface hardens the metal producing a metal more inclined to crack than 
&gt; 
This is true, but be warned, the problems of dipping a unibody car
may be worse, etchant will continue to leak from the seams for an
eternity to come if not well done.  Most pros cut the seams open so they
can be cleaned as well and drain then reweld, an ominous task.  
Plus a Bus will take one hell of a dip tank, nearly aircraft size. An
alternative to consider that I have heard is wonderful is abrasive
blasting with plastic media or even better crushed walnut shells
at lower pressures.  The effects of work hardening are lessened as
heating is lessened and less warpage from heat and force of the blast.
BTW, paint stripping is not a &quot;backyard job&quot; for the faint of heart
or weak of contitution either, toxic chemicals, needing carefull
cleanup.  Not fun in general IMHO, though I will say, the exterior of a
bus is about as easy to strip as they come due the large flat panels,
but one should try to get a thicker gelled stripper if possible. Consult
your paint supplier of Hemmings Motor News put down lots of plastic
tarps, do it outside, with full clothing, gloves, mask, etc and try
to dispose of the stuff correctly if anyone will take it.  I chemically
stripped the sides of a friends bus once, after I had sanded the entire
roof with a DA, I would do neither again by choice unless doing a full
100 pt resto, it is not worth the effort generally to go to bare metal,
plus you may not like what you find.  Unfortunately, roofs often need
to go to bare metal as old paint tends to craze and rust in the bottoms
of the cracks since roofs aren't often waxed well over a Bus life.

Some thoughts.
