Subject:      Re: Shrinking parts OR expanding wood ?

Are your sure it's the plastic shrinking versus the wood swelling ?

I can't imagine plastic shrinking to the extent that it's visably
noticeable. But swelling/expanding pressed wood, which most, if not all
the cabinetry in our Westies is made of, is notorious for swelling when
wet ... or under very humid conditions ... especially really cheap pressed
wood.

&gt; &gt;Is anyone else experiencing shinking plastic trim pieces on their Westfalia
&gt; &gt;interiors.  It seems that around all the openings and the edges of the
&gt; &gt;tables and stove/sink covers the edging is slowly getting smaller exposing
&gt; &gt;the plywood.  I was wondering if it is from heat or is time the enemy?  Is
&gt; &gt;there anything that can be done to slow the process, or can this material be
&gt; &gt;replaced?  Just trying to keep it looking new for as long as possible.
&gt; &gt;
