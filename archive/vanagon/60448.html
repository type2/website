Subject: Re: Smelly (burning wire/plastic) Fridge Question
Date: Sat, 24 May 1997 22:33:08 -0400


&gt; So I have a &quot;new&quot; 90 Westy.... low miles and refrig little used.  I fired
it
&gt; up on propane and it smells a little like warm / burning plastic or
&gt; wiring.... Any suggestions?  Could it just be residue or ?? from not much
&gt; use???

I just got the fridge in my &quot;new&quot; '89 working for the first time in who
knows how long, and got the same smell.  It went away after about an hour
or so, and the fridge has worked fine.
