Subject: 89 Vanagon Camper

I am considering purchasing a 1989 Westfalia Vanagon camper.

It has 112,000 miles on it, some body damage (front and rear bumpers and
surfaces above the bumpers), several broken locks (rear and glovebox), a
crack in the skylight/roof vent and is quite dirty inside.  I am not
sure if the stove, etc work or not and it appears that there is no
table, but I could be wrong about this.  The inspection and license are
not current.

According to the owner and the mechanic where it is located, it has a
new used (not rebuilt) engine, a new used transmission, new brakes, new
tires, and new CV joint.  Her stated reason for selling is that parts
are difficult to get and expensive to purchase and have installed.

I plan to have a mechanic look at it before buying it.  What should he
look for?  What kinds of problems are 89 campers prone to?  What is a
reasonable price to pay for it &quot;as is&quot;?  Any additional advice/cautions
would also be appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Dianne
