Hi all,

I have a couple of problems with the following van:

Vehicle details:

90 Transporter van (Australia)
2.1 Litre 4 cyl 'Waterboxer', gasoline, fuel injected (Bosch?),
10k miles - Dad's retired, doesn't drive that much.

Problems.

1.	Starting when hot.

Dealer replaced the wiring harness to theair flow sensor; fuel injector cleaner
has been run through it, problem persists.  Could it be vapor lock?


2.	Strange clunking noise when going over bumps.

Sounds like it comes from under the floor, near one of the front wheels /
steering gear.  While in
warranty, it went back to the dealer a few times, but they couldn't find the
problem.  Tried remounting the fuel tank with new rubbers, and inspected the
brake calipers - no luck.

Joel Walker suggested broken grommet on bottom of shock absorber, Derek Drew
suggested ball joints (thanks guys), but the van's made this noise since NEW,
 and still makes the noise..... Any other ideas?

Thanks,

Kingsley
