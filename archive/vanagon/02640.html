Subject: Re: front to rearcoolant pipes-starting to rust more than a bit!

&gt; 
&gt; Greetings,
&gt;  I was just under the van and noticed that the coolant pipes
&gt; on my van are rusting rather badly in the area in which they make the
&gt; turn  going from under the car to the engine. [In the rear}
&gt; Has anyone had to replace theirs? If so, how much should
&gt; I start socking away?
&gt;   I think I'll try some 'miracle rust converter' that
&gt; will change the rust to stainless steel. Btw, why didnt VW use stainless initially?
&gt; Bill
&gt; 

That was one of things my '84 needed when I bought it back in March.
I believe the part, just one pipe, was $130 new with labor around $100
and at that the shop said they lost money on the labor.  It took nearly
a week to get the part.  It had be flown in from Germany as one could not
be found anywhere in the states.
