&gt;now there's a thought ... your $30,000 would just about buy a Dehler Profi
&gt;.. a really really neat package, made in germany, with stand up shower and
&gt;sit-down toilet built into the same old vanagon bus. :) high roof with
&gt;air conditioning and windows in the roof. really neat, but super
&gt;expensive. :(  looks like david schwarze's bus ... except made by mercedes!

It wouldn't fill my emotional needs, though.  Ever since I was a kid I
thought the tilt-top campers were the COOLest things on the road.  Other
kids drooled over bitchin' Camaros, but I've always wanted a bus with a
tilt-top roof.

(Actually, I think the tall-roofed campers are darned ugly.  My humble
opinion, of course.)
