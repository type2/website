&gt; Ok, folks, group input needed!  What's going to be &quot;our&quot; policy
&gt; on non-'netters joining this group?  Seems fine to me, but also
&gt; seems that the group should decide....

&gt; 

Good question.  Well, I think like any other organization that 
could potential be sued for people causing accidents and such.
This not only applies to persons outside, but also to persons
inside the group.  Duh... ;)  Anyway, maybe Ric (the attorney)
can help us out as far as that goes.  

Otherwise I don't have a problem with other people not on the
net joining in.  More knowledge in the pool always helps!  

We should be aware of the liabilities and maybe get some kind
of waiver signed so that the rest of the group is not responsible
for individuals acts.  This could be a problem state to state.
I don't know.  Maybe I worry too much.  If we got a sponser, then
they would definitely want us to sign something like that.

We should have a list of rules that have to be adhered to especially
when we are driving as a group.  Yeah, I know, rules, rules rules!
But I think it would keep people from making unfortunate mistakes
and ending up with bad feelings and all.  Maybe every one should
be charged a sign-up fee so that they are really commited and not
just hangin' out for the free lunches so-to-speak.  There really
is no way to keep someone from driving the same route though.

I think most of us are probably responsible and being in the kind
of vehicles we are in kind of limits us to doing to many crazy
things.  I just hope these are not any famous last words. ;)

That's all for now,

Cheers!
