Subject:      Re: in defense of grits!

well ...

i was born in alabama, raised in alabama, lived here all my natural life
(cept for the times i lived somewheres else ... and when i was in the army),
and will most likely die here.  i've had grits served to me in every manner
know to mortal man.

and i still don't like them.

grits are a lot like liver: if it's cooked properly and well, it's edible.
period.  if it's cooked the least little bit &quot;wrong&quot;, it's inedible.

cold grits can hurt people (if you throw it at them).
