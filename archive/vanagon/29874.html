Subject:       Re: Speedo Woes

&gt; Tonight on the way home, I start hearing this squeeky noise, kinda
&gt; warbly-squeeky.  I reach my hand under the dash and twitch the cable and
&gt; it stops, only to return a mile or so later.  It kept getting worse, and
&gt; un-silenceable until I finally pulled the cable off (while driving!)
&gt; when it got to the incredible death wail stage.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone ever have this happen?  Is there any hope?  Or do I have to con
&gt; MH into passing along the '53 KMH speedo he found?

Thom!

Same story, different bus.

My bus started making the crazy wzza-wzza-wzza noise.  It got louder, 
and then one time, a sharp snap, and now my speedo doesn't do 
anything.  

I know the cable is still working because the odometer works, but 
just no speedo.

It sounds like you're having internal speedometer trouble too.  
Someone posted the name of a place that repairs VDO's if I remember 
right...

I am not sure if the Pioneer has the correct speedometer or not.  Do 
you have any info on what it should look like exactly?  Were there 
differences in the early years?

Thanks!
