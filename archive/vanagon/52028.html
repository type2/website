Subject: throttle switch &amp; heater cable

 
I just had my '87 Syncro GL in for its last service plan covered repair 
(check your mileage... I almost blew it!).  The dealer identified some 
things that were not covered, and with which I am unfamiliar:

According to them, it is running rich at start-up, due to a failing 
throttle switch.  This is causing premature wear of the distributor 
rotor, which is relativey new.  Does this sound reasonable?  If so, is it 
something I can live with &quot;for a while&quot;?

And, I complained about the low heat output, and they declared the heater 
temperature cable to be bent/kinked/whatever.  I am doubtful.  Has anyone 
experienced this problem?  The van passed their pressure test of the 
cooling system, no leaks, despite the sweetish odor from the rear heater.

Thanks in advance for any help.  This list has been a valuable resource 
for me, and saved me plenty of repair bills.  Now that the service plan 
has expired, I will be on my own for all the repairs.  When I first 
joined the list, soon after buying the van, it discouraged me to read 
about all the troubles others seemed to be having.  So let me take this 
space to say that over all, my Vanagon has been a fine, reliable vehicle, 
and useful as all-get-out.  And to anyone who might have just joined the 
discussion, do not dispair; be good to your VW and it will be good to you.

And if any other Fairbanks listserv members would like to swap expertise 
and repair shop opinions, please get in touch with me.  

Thanks,
