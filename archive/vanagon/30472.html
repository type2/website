Subject: Re: searching for potable water pump

Euro-American RV Products (formerly Delta Six Industries) has original
replacement parts for much of the Westy gear including potable water pumps.
They can be reached at 818.760.4214. I just ordered a replacement skylight
and the city water filler. They were prompt, no problems, cheaper than
dealer...

&gt;We just got an '85 westy and have found that the potable water pump has
&gt;been frozen so as not to be usable any more.  Does anyone know where one
&gt;can be found?  Thanks in advance!!
