My 87 Syncro came with the rubber outer boots, which I assume were the
original.  I replaced the right outer with a white plastic boot 2 years
ago.  This boot now has a small hole in it.  Grease is not yet coming out
of the hole, so I am only monitoring the situation for now.  With 4 cars,
things are done on a priority or triage basis!
