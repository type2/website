Subject: Internet Censorship Bill (fwd)



        To all Online Ford People,
        This message was forwarded to me by a fellow student here at UCI. 
Although it is not about Fords, it would most likely interest you.  Check
it out!

        A matter has come to my attention that is of the utmost importance
to all of us online.
A couple of senators have proposed a particularly heinous piece of
legislation titled the &quot;Communications Decency Act of 1995&quot;  (Senate Bill
S. 314).  Basically, the bill would subject all forms of electronic
communication --from public Internet postings to your most private email
--to government censorship.  The effects of the bill onto theonline
industry would be devastating -- most colleges and private companies (AOL,
Compuserve, etc.) would probably have to shut down or greatly restrict
access, since they would be held criminally liable for the postings and
email of private users.

        A petition, to be sent to Congress, the President, and the media,
has begun spreading through the Internet.  It's easy to participate and be
heard -- to sign it, you simply follow the instructions below -- which boil
down to sending a quick email message to a certain address.  That's all it
takes to let your voice be heard. (You know, if the Internet makes
democracy this accessible to the average citizen, is it any wonder Congress
wants to censor it?)
        
        Finally, PLEASE forward this message to all your friends online.
The more people sign the petition, the more the government will get the
message to back off the online community.  We've been doing fine without
censorship until now -- let's show them we don't plan on allowing them to
start now.  If you value your freedoms -- from your right to publicly post
a message on a worldwide forum to your right to receive private email
without the government censoring it -- you need to take action NOW.  It'll
take fifteen minutes at the most, a small sacrifice considering the issues
at hand.  Remember, the age of fighting for liberty with muskets and shells
is most likely over; the time has come where the keyboard and the phone
line will prove mightier than the sword -- or the Senate, in this case.

 Here's what you have to do to sign the petition:

 Send an e-mail message to:  S314-petition_at_netcom_dot_com
 the message (NOT the subject heading) should read as follows:
 SIGNED &lt;your online address&gt; &lt;your full name&gt; &lt;U.S. Citizen (y/n)&gt;
 eg.  SIGNED lsewell_at_leland.Stanford.EDU  Laura Sewell  YES

        If you are interested in signing the petition, I would highly
suggest investigating the details of the situation.  You can find out more
on the Web at    http://www.wookie_dot_net/~slowdog [this is outdated --try
