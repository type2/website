&gt;  &gt; Pardon my ignorance, but I thought &quot;Eurobago&quot; was a kind of cool generic
&gt;  &gt; slang for VW camper.  I was ready to start using it.  You mean there is
a
&gt;  &gt; vw/winnebago?  What an odd combination.  Does anyone have any pics?
&gt;  
&gt;   Yes, strange as it may sound, VW teamed up with Winnebago to create the
&gt;  most expensive camper-van yet! The one that I am familiar with is called
&gt;  the Rialta. It looks like a Winnebago that someone grafted onto 
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;   There is also a EuroVan Westy, but that's different (and cheaper). 

There are several different models being discussed here.

In 1993 (perhaps other years also??) VW offered the Eurovan MV model which
was very much like the Vanagon Multivan model sold for the 1990 &amp; 1991 model
years.  The pop-top was done by Westfalia and contained seating for 7, but NO
sink, stove, etc.

When VW decided to offer a &quot;Camper&quot; version of the Eurovan in the USA, (1995
I think) it considered using Westfalia (as it had for MANY years), but choose
instead Winnebago in Iowa.  
VW ships Eurovans to Winnebago and Winnebago completes them into TWO
different products.  

One is very Westfalia-like and has a sink, stove, refer and pop-top built
within the bounds of the extended length Eurovan.  Winnebago ships these
vehicles to VW dealers, who sell them at Eurovan Campers (I think that's the
name).  List price is about $35,000 I think.

Winnebago converts some of the Eurovans into mini-motorhomes, by adding
Winnebago's own body (aft of the front doors) that's about 20&quot;-24&quot; wider than
the normal Eurovan.  Inside they install sink, stove, refer, toilet and other
stuff.  While the Winnebago body is tall (as even mini-motorhomes are) there
is no pop-top in this version.  They name this vehicle the Rialta and sell
them through Winnebago's own network of RV dealers.  List price is about
$45,000 I think.

Westfalia still makes &quot;camper&quot; versions of the Eurovans for sale in many
parts of the world, just not in the USA.  So you can buy a &quot;Eurovan Westy&quot;
today, but not in the USA.

So, someone in Germany might be talking accurately about his Eurovan &quot;Westy&quot;
while in the USA we have the Eurovan &quot;Winnie&quot;.  Other's might accurately
describe their Eurovan MW as a &quot;Westy&quot;, since it does have a Westfalia
pop-top.

Nothin's ever simple is it?
