Has anyone found a cheap way to test the fuel injection lambada to see if 
it is dead or not? And if you just replace it, what are the chances that 
the new (used) one will just fry from the same cause that fried the old 
one (since we don't  know what killed it, eh?) -- we assume it is dead, 
since  the various units activate if you apply current to them with a 
jumper, but not when running the car. This is on an Audi,  but the 
injection systems are pretty much the same.

    All is impermanent, but this too shall pass away, and the way of the
Samurai is death --- so speak your mind now, or forever hold your peace!
