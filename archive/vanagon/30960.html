Subject: Re: Noisy console II

&gt;I still haven't solved the problem of the rattles in the stove 
&gt;section of the console in the 86.  Any valid suggestions?

I have to place a dish towel on top of my stove before closing the lid, else 
I get major rattles. Works great for me, but I don't know exactly what is 
ratteling in your rig.
