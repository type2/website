Don,

&gt; So, in the cold and slush, I crawl under and find the problem.  Turns out I

&gt; 
&gt; The splines on the shaft look OK, but it's hard to see very well under there
&gt; - a dark, tight place.  I'm worried about the shaft needing to be replaced.
&gt; That would mean the trans out and apart.  Probably over my head, and also
&gt; needs special tools, right?  It looks OK, and I'm hoping it is.  I guess
&gt; I'll know more when I try to fit the new part.  Anyone know if the shaft
&gt; coming out of the trans is a harder metal than the bracket is made out of?
&gt; The bracket seems softer, kind of a goldish color.  Keeping my fingers crossed!

Your 80 should be the same as my 81, which is to say that the end cap on 
the tranny, or gear shift housing, comes off.  It's not a job to do with 
the tranny in place, although it can be.  Took me about 6 hours to sway 
one out in the dirt parking lot of a mechanic in Salida, Colorado.  
Should have been a 1.5 hour job but the lack of the correct tools for the 
job slowed things down to a crawl.  

I have one in my garage that I paid $40 for.  All it needs is the 
selector fork clip, which yours should have.  If you want it let me know 
and we'll work something out.

If you don't want it it's no sweat, I'll probably use it somewhere down 
the road.  Let me know if you need help.  I've also got the Bentley in 
case you don't and can send you the diagrams of the tranny/gear shift 
housing to show you how everything comes apart.

PS -- isn't there a bolt on the end of the shaft that holds the bracket 
on?  Is it gone or will tightening it solve the problem?
