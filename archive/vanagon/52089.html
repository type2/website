Subject: Re: Snow Traction Devices?

I have experimented extensively with every possible device. For example, I
use cable chains I got from Whitless. I hate them because they break and are
a pain to install. 

Next time I get chains (after I go to big tires, 5.43 gears, and 15&quot; wheels)
I'll get the thickest, heaviest duty chains I can find--the kind with the
little cross claws welded on.

Anyway, the verdict is that BY FAR--that is, a HUGE MARGIN,. the best snow
traction devide is a 12 volt air compressor. If the terrain is slippery in
any way but sheet ice, the best traction is to be had by simply airing down
the tires. You can go as low as 15 psi or so although this limits your speed
a lot, so you can try, higher pressures and higher speeds when the
conditions are not too bad.

I know from experience that it will be hard for you to remember and heed
this advice but there it is...

&gt;     Hi All,
&gt;     
&gt;       Any suggestions for snow traction devices for an '85 Westy.  How 
&gt;     about chains vs. cables.  Are there some brands/types that are easier 
&gt;     to put on than others?  
&gt;       I have a set of cables for my other car that I dread to put on 
&gt;     because you have to reach behind the wheel and thread a nylon web 
&gt;     through a buckle to secure them.  This is not easy when your hands are 
&gt;     cold &amp; numb and you can't see what your doing because the wheel is 
&gt;     blocking your sight.
&gt;     
&gt;     Thanks In Advance,
&gt;     
&gt;     Vince.
