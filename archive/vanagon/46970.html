Subject: Lost Treasure / Goodbye

I'm leaving on a two-week business trip (no, really) in the morning and 
will lurk through the evening (then I'm outta here).  Don't know if I can 
stand 2 weeks w/o my daily dose of list traffic. :(

When I get back I'll tantalize/bore/upset you with yet another tale of Bus 
riches that are coming my way (hopefully to be concluded this evening).  
It has been a two year saga known as &quot;The Lost Treasure of Linden Lure&quot;.

Until then ...
