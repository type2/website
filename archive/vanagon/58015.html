The next time you want to cheer because some government organization cracked
down on &quot;big Bidness&quot; think about this thread first.  That pint of ethanol is
insignificant to you, but multiplied by the thousands of individuals like you
at hundreds of universities... you get the point.  When &quot;Big bidness&quot; dumps
10,000 gallons you don't know if it was first diluted down to 5%.  Maybe it
was, maybe it wasn't.  You just hear about how all those bad corporations are
polluting the environment.  Whats good for the goose...:(   
Smog laws, while asinine to apply to vehicles which constitute such a small
percentage of the total vehicle population, are laws.  If you don't like
them, do something about it.  It is funny how we don't seem to care until the
taxman is at our door demanding money.    Don't become an activist (I hate
that word), become a good citizen.  This group has as much voice as any other
special interest group (shhh, thats a dirty word).  If its broke, this system
has a way for us to fix it.   Or would we rather watch comets and complain?
 I apologize to those on the list who take their citizenship seriously.   And
having spent an hour last night enjoying the comet myself (is that thing
spectacular or what?),  I am not endicting astronomers or star gazers.   I am
not writing this to berate, but to inspire.   California &amp; New York are only
the beginning of the nightmare for those of us who like older vehicles.    It
will spread.  Eventhough the bulk of the pollution comes from poorly
maintained newer vehicles (see the writings of Pat Bedard of Car &amp; Driver on
this subject.  An unlikely source, He did a pretty thorough job on the
topic), our lovingly maintained busses will be at the alter of sacrifice to
the gods of instant gratification at the EPA and their State accomplices.
 Guard your children well my friends.  I am keeping my powder dry.

Loafing till they pry the steering wheel from my cold hands (to steal a
phrase)
