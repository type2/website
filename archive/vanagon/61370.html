Subject: short in headlight wiring ... somewhere
Date: Fri, 13 Jun 1997 14:34:54 -0400

When I turn on headlights, the blue highbeams indicator is on permanently but
no headlights.  This was a rare intermittent thing that is now consistent.  A
couple of times it seems to ahve un-done itself when I jiggled and repeatedly
switched the high beams switch on the steering column, so I suspect the problem
is there.  Also, once, the high beam switch would cause the wipers to go on.

Any tips on what to do.  Thanks.
