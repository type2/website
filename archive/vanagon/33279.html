&gt; &gt; Would any one believe me if I said I named my '67 Deluxe
&gt; &gt; &quot;Potluck&quot; because one piece came from here and another
&gt; &gt; piece came from there and...?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Didn't think so.

What I want to know is one piece of what came from here and one
piece of what came from there?  In some instances, depending on the
PO, &quot;Potluck&quot; may fit rather appropriately.
