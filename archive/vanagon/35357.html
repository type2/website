Subject: 83'Audi 5000 Turbo Diesel -&gt; Vanagon?

I have followed the ongoing discussion about possible engine transplants for
Vanagons, and remember that the VW (Audi) 5cl gasoline engine of the Audi
5000 was mentioned. However, I don't recall having seen the Audi 5000 Turbo
Diesel engine in that thread. Any experiences, comments, wise thoughts etc.
on that one.....
