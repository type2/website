&gt; 
&gt; Following is my response to those who have requested information about my
&gt; awning purchase. It is a copy of the letter I wrote ordering the awning. I
&gt; paid full retail price for this, which none of you should do, so I think you
&gt; can get about 30% off by shopping around. I have files with information about
&gt; discount vendors of A&amp;E awnings but am too busy to dig them out (without a
&gt; bribe of some sort.) A&amp;E is sort of like the General Motors of the awning
&gt; business. I doubt any of you will buy anthing but just the awning and the van
&gt; adaptor kit for Vanagon as the screen room is very expensive.
&gt; 

I wonder if there is enough interest, if we could get a group discount somewhere.
If so I could look into it.  I'd definately shop around.
