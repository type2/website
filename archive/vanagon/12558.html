Subject: UK Single-cabs, leaking bell-housing

	Marcus,
	1) I paid $1200 for my '70 single-cab with no engine, just
blown pieces. But it has a fair body and new gates. 500 quid for
needs body work would be ok if the engine seemed really strong,  and
you have the time and inclination. My 1 new P anyway.

	2) If the black oil dripping from your housemate's bellhousing 
stinks like tranny oil, its tranny oil. Open the filler plug ON THE SIDE 
and get a finger-tip-dip of the contents. Same color, smell? If the stuff in
the tranny isn't stinky, you can't smell or it isn't the right stuff.
This isn't one of those subtle things.

	3) Is the leak really coming out of the bell-housing, or is it
coming out of the case back there?  You might want to do a wipe and watch
test on it when warm... but I've never heard of such a thing fixing
itself and it sounds to me like your housemate win a session of engine 
and tranny removal...

	4) List folks, can Marcus's friend check the torque on the
nuts holding the case halves together? - ie put a wrench on it and
take the wrench up to the stated figure and see if the nut moves,
or if the wrench sets at that torque (or clicks if a click-type)?
