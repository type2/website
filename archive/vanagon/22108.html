I'm not sure if the setup on the '71 is like my vanagon, but mine popped
on both sides within a month of each other.  I would tend to beleive your
son that it &quot;just popped&quot; at a corner as mine did.  I think the problem is
that the metal bushings contained in the rubber shock mounts get rusted to
the point that the (anti-)swaybar linkage studs (part of the casting) are 
no longer free to move and get snapped off.  

Note: I was able to &quot;rebuild&quot; my stabilizer bar linkages by grinding off the
remaining part of the stud and then drilling and tapping the linkage.  So,
my stabilizer bar links are now held in by bolts threaded into the links 
rather than nuts on the ends of the studs.   Its holding so far.... YMMV
