Subject:      Re: List Split Announcement [IMPORTANT]

well, i'll add another $0.0000000002 worth here (hey. i'm old. i'm entitled.)

i kinda don't look at it as TWO lists exactly. more like a big family has
had some of the kids move off to another city. it's still the same family,
just part of us are in a different location. we can still talk and call and
ask and argue and meet up for vacations and holidays and such ... and still
be the same family.

just cause you move away from your mom and dad and sister and brother, you
don't divorce yourself from the &quot;family&quot;.

so let's look at it that way. and if it works out, great. more fun for
everyone. if it doesn't work out, well, we'll welcome everybody back ...
they can sleep in the garage. :)  besides, in actual historical fact,
Vanagon_at_Lenti is the SECOND bus list (that i know of) ... the first one
got derailed due to work pressures on the originator. which is why Gerry
was so weak and able to be coerced into starting another one. ;)

so let's all be happy/sad, like when Grandma gets on the bus to go back
home ... we're sad to see the old bat have to ride the hot sweaty bus,
but boy, are we glad we don't have to hear that snorring anymore!!!

no ... wait, that's a bad analogy. :)  how bout when the kids go off to
college? or their first job? something like that.  they'll be gone, but
not forgotten ... and still part of the same Family of Buses.
