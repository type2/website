&gt; &gt; Walt - How do you &quot;check&quot; your propane level?

&gt; 
&gt; 	I pull up next to the big fill tank and ask the person on-duty to fill-
&gt; 	it-up. That's how I check it :-)

The only problem with this method is that some places have a minimum
charge. So with these small tanks (at least mine is tiny), its best to
squeeeeeeeeeeeeezzzzzzzz the most out of it.
