I can personally attest to the fact that turning off the ignition and 
then turning it back on will blow out a marginal muffler.  When i was 
young, rebellious, and ignorant (i'm still two of the three) i blew the 
muffler completely off a '70 Scout, blew a hole in a '67 LeMans, and 
stripped the timing gears on a 850 Fiat all by trying to produce 
cannon-like reports.  Stupid but spectacular-- especially at night.

Still haven't figured out what happened with the Fiat...
