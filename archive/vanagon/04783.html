Subject: Items to have in your van


I'm sorry, I don't remember you'r name, but to whoever asked about what 
to make sure you had in your van for a long road trip.

I know you've alreadfy received some pretty complete lists, but I don't 
know if anyone has mentioned...

12V Compressor.  To fill your tires. when you're already running your 
spare, you've a slow leak and it's only 50 more miles to town.
I got one from Canadian Tire (a Canadian chain), I assume that it's like 
the J.C. somthing that you Americans are always talking about.  You can 
get different models from about $10-40 depending on how many gimmicks you 
want.  I bet sears would have one too.

anyway,  Cheers
