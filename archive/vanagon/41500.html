&gt;One more question about my '66 fan shroud.  I'm mounting a dog-house
&gt;cooling system on the engine I'm building and the dog-house shroud has
&gt;a small (mebbe 1/2 inch) pipe sticking out the *top* of the shroud off
&gt;to one side a bit.  This is in addition to the two fresh-air-heating air
&gt;ducts on the *back* (back means back of the car) of the shroud that connect
&gt;to the heat exchangers and the duct on the *front* of the shroud for the oil
&gt;cooler exhaust.  What is this pipe used for?  (I guess this is a good
&gt;question for 1971 bus owners or for 1971 and later sedan owners since that
&gt;was where the dog-house cooling tin was used.)
&gt;
Hey, I was wondering that myself.  When I bought my '71, nothing was hooked
up to it either.  I just plugged it so that air that might be used for
cooling wasn't being released from it, but I'm kind of curious.
