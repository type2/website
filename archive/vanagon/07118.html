&gt;In the category of &quot;boring cocktail trivia&quot;, I thought that blue LEDs were
&gt;very rare, sort of military only stuff. The &quot;blue&quot; LEDs I have stripped
&gt;from VW instruments have been white ones with a blue filter. Does anybody
&gt;know of the existance of true blue LEDs?, and anybody care to comment on
&gt;the effect of tv development if such things exist?

as far as i know, ALL the vanagons have a blue headlight high-beam indicator
... which looks like an LED but really isn't. it's some sort of little bulb
that is packaged just like an LED, but is really an incandescent device (at
least i THINK it's incandescent ... it's never listed in anything as an LED).

on a somewhat tangent point: i didn't like my turn signal indicator LED being
green (since turn signals are all yellow on the outside!) ... so i got a
proper sized radio shack yellow LED and swapped it out. works fine. :)
yeah, i know. but i have this 'thing' about yellow and red lights/led meaning
warning and caution and such ... and green meaning ok/power/on ... so i just
changed it. :)
