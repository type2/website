Subject: How hot should oil get?

I have a 71 VW Camper with an upright 1600cc engine. The oil temp sensor is
mounted in the oil drain plug. It was 94 degrees in NC today, and after
driving for about 30 minutes at 60-65 mph my gauge read 200 degrees. I have
been told that the gauge tends to read lower where I have the sensor located
. I have yet to take this vehicle on a road trip, and would very much like
to know exactly how hot should the oil get? At what point should I be
concerned enough to pull over and let it cool down a while? Also, will the
side windows (push outs) being open affect the air flow into the engine
compartment enough to make the engine run warmer? Someone told me these air
intakes only cool the passengers, but on my 71 the intakes run straight into
the engine compartment.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
