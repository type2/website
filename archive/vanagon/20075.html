Al,
  I don't know if this will be of any help, but I once passed emmissions on 
an old Caddy by putting two bottles of &quot;Octane 108&quot; in the gas.  Cost was 
about $10.  Without them, I failed every time.

&gt; Last i talked to everyone i was trying to sell my syncro.  We'll i just
&gt; couldn't do it!!  My wife is pissed, but i think she knows things would 
be
&gt; worse if i got rid of it.  My problem is that i'm due for emissions in
&gt; connecticut in a couple of weeks.  (connecticut has gotten really severe
&gt; concerning emissions). Last time thru i failed terribly and had to get
&gt; waived.  Of course this is after spending some big bucks and it still 
failed.
&gt; The dealer is no help, he said they all fail.

 From as strictly ANALytical view consider:

 EFI looks at O2 and Coolant Temp to decide on pulse width( some other 
stuff
too but mainly O2 and Coolant Temp.

Check the grounding for both the EFI and the rest of the motor.  There's 
a bunch of brown wires on the LH side of the engine bay all bolted down to
one place.  DISCONNECT the NEGATIVE on the battery and then ONLY THEN dis-
connect these wires.  Use a wire brush to get grunge and paint away from 
the
area where the wire connectors ground to the frame.  Use a star washer 
between the connector stack and the metal.  Make sure the connectors are 
bright and shiny.  They're brass and you can use vinegar and salt to clean
em or any brass polish.  The system reference for some of the sensors are
right here and if they float by say 500mv vs the rest of the system you've
built in an undetectable error.     

Take the connector for the coolant temp sensor off and put it back on. This
will clean up any grunge that may not allow proper connections here.

Do the same for the Digitalelephant (DIGI-FANT) FI &quot;computer&quot; connector.
Just take it off and put it back on (gently here) 

If you have had coolant in the exhaust you could have fouled the O2 sensor
They're pretty cheap at the Ford Parts place so simply buy the spare now 
and replace the one you have.  Part number was posted a while back.

Now put the ground strap back to the battery.  Try 'er out.  If no 
difference
is noticed you're out of your league and a dealer/good FI man trip is in 
order.
