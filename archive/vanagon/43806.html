Subject: Politics- snork!

&gt;One interesting thing today here in the State of Minnesota.  We have a
&gt;liberal U.S. Senator here by the name of Wellstone.  The Republicans, 
&gt;in an effort to embarrass him plan on following him around in a '67 VW Bus.
&gt;They claim the Bus is supposed to represent the obsolete liberal past.

	Remember, the Republicans are the ones who claim to be rational...

	Hear that Maher, your V6agon is a symbol of an obsolete liberal
past :) Or is that GM V6 the engine of capitalism?

	You could never make up stuff like this- nobody would believe it!

	Bill
