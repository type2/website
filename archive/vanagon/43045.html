Subject: 91 Vanagon, oil pressure anomaly

Right to the problem: Every time I exit the freeway, the oil pressure 
light and buzzer (you know, the one that triples your heart rate in a 
split second) come on. In every instance, I have immediately pulled over, 
stopped the engine, and checked the oil (always fine). I turn the engine 
on again after a minute or two and everything is fine (no light, no 
buzzer). Is this my vans way of telling me it doesn't want to leave the 
freeway? 8-) Any advise of information is appreciated.

Patrick
