Subject: FS: '78 Bus

My brother is trying to get rid of his '78 Bus so I thought I should 
tell all of you first.  He wants $350 firm w/o engine.  It has the 
factory AC.  The bottom half is brown and the top half is that creamy 
brownish color.  I don't think it would be very hard to restore.
We live in GA.

                                      whysper1_at_aol_dot_com
