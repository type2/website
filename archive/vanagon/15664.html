&gt;   This may sound like a total idiot-stick question, but how does one
&gt;  adjust the mixture on the dual carbs found on 1700 powerplants? There
&gt;  is, of course the &quot;volume control screw&quot;, but no matter how much I
&gt;  adjust this, my baby still spews black smoke (and gets worse mileage
&gt;  than a Harley). Is there a way to lean the mixture out on these carbs? 
&gt;   Or will the rest of my truckin' life be filled with raunch odours and
&gt;  empty pocketbooks? 

There are two small mixture screws, one in the base of each carb (on the
outside of the carb).  

I believe the book says to start with them all the way in, and then back each 
one out two complete turns.  That's the way I set mine, and they run pretty
good (although they should really be adjusted with an airflow meter).

It's also possible that you have the wrong sized jets, but you have to
pretty much take the carbs out to get to them.  The Haynes manual has the
specs on the jets, but I think they are something like 127.5 main, 170
air bleed, but don't quote me on it.
