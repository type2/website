Subject: Re: RESULTS - Tire Survey 

Gail,

With only 4 non-Westies in the survey, there is not enough data to draw conclusions about 
differences between the two configurations.

The 185R14 reinforced Michelin is probably a better selection for passenger buses.  For 
Westies that might see some &quot;off the road&quot; use (ie, camping) the Yokohama LT195/75R14 light 
truck tire is probably better.  Also, the Yokohama is a slightly bigger tire, so can better 
handle the conversions greater weight.

&gt;Excellent survey!  Thank you for all the info you've shared about tires.  I
&gt;purchased my '87 GL only recently, w/ no service records of any kind, so
&gt;have lots of questions wrt best products and strategies to keep it running
&gt;optimally for a long time.
&gt;
&gt;One question re: the survey---since I understand that Westies weigh quite a
&gt;bit more than non-camper V-gons, are there any indications of differences in
&gt;tire needs that might affect the choice, e.g. between the Michelin
&gt;reinforced and the Yokohama Load range D?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks again.
