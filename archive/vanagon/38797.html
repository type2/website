Subject: Unexpected April Fools joke (on me)

Yesterday, I was burnt out from the work day and sitting first in line at a
red traffic light listening to the NPR Starbucks Coffee Pipeline story.
While I was zoning out in the '83 Westy waiting for the light to change I
noticed an early single cab with a hoop/stays setup zooming/bouncing through
the intersection. It crossed right in front of me pushing the yellow light.
For a second I thought &quot;Kew~el a single just like ours!&quot; Duh! It was Cherry
VanBondo toting the groceries home.  I didn't recognize the new Krylon red
iron oxide rattle can paint job for a second. 
I wonder what hoser used Krylon for gosh sakes. At least he coulda sanded it
into a consistant smoothness. We discussed the yellow light action and put
away the groceries minutes later. =) Mrs. VanBondo thought it was funny and
wrote it off as additional proof that she married a true MENSA candidate.
