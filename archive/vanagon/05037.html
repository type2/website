Well it happened, we left the house in hurry to get to IKEA before it
closed, and as we rounded the corner and moved up over the bridge and
across the canal, the engine spluttered, slowed, rolled over and died. I
knew then that we were out of gas! We rolled back down the bridge and
fortunately since we weren't too far from home, my wife was able to
retrieve her Renault 5 and push me unceremoniously home..... (how
embarassing...). The only other time this has happened to us was the
time we were driving back from BC
in the Karmann Ghia and ran out of gas around Sault Sainte Marie (N.
Ontario) around 1 in the morning in the middle of  nowhere.
Fortunately we were able to hitch a ride to the closest gas station
(since cars were't passing us at an enormous rate we did not hesitate
when a truck offered us a lift, without
thinking we left the top down and everything, camera etc in the car....it was
ok).
The closest gas station was about 50 miles away and the truck turned out
to be carrying dynamite (hence the aircraft landing lights affixed to the
front lest they
hit anything the size of a deer). We made it back about 5 am... (the gas
station owner personally drove us the distance...) but the container he
gave was used to hold old oil....the KG backfired that entire tank....as I
recall.


Any way the point of this is that the Vanagon gas gauge is way off...the
needle was hardly at the red point on the gauge when it died....and the gauge
will
read half empty after only 90 miles have gone by....what's up with that?
How is it fixed......any ideas - DC
