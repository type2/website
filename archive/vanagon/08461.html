Subject: Re: Pizza in the Bay Area

You guys set the pizza thing for whenever is convenient, since my
schedule will throw a wrench into things, so to speak.  If I can join
you, I would love to, just let me know where and when you decide.  AFTER
x-mas is definitely better for me, as I don't have a free nite before,
but set it when you need to..
