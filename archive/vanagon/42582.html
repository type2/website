Subject: Want me to visit???

Howdy all. The time is rolling around for me to depart on a two month or so
journey out west. I and 4 friends are taking my '67 pop-top and a '70 camper
out to points unknown. We are heading to Colorado, New Mexico, and the like,
and then, depending on how time and money hold out, we may make it to
California. We are pretty much definately going to the Rainbow Gathering in the
Ozarks, which is the first week or so of July. We are also going to the Deer
Creek Furthur Festival show, which is June 26th. We will be leaving after
Busses on the Blue Ridge Parkway, which is next weekend. Other than that, the
schedule is flexible.
  So anyway, if anyone wants 2 busses full of hippies to come by and say hello,
feel free to let me know. I would love to meet as many listfolk as possible,
and talk busses, or whatever. So, if you are interested in us visiting, please
let me know over the next few days. We are leaving Thursday, the 30th...
