Subject: RE: T4 Kombis and Double Cab VANS!!

Hey, if everyone wants to pitch in and buy one of these, I'll be happy to 
keep it at my house and keep pictures of it on-line for everyone to see!

Just send your checks to me. Sign them; I'll fill in the amount once we 
figure the split.

It's Friday, what can I say? 8) Joe

&gt; Cool!  When I was in London and Ireland last summer, I was amazed at the 
&gt; different
&gt; VWs available over there.  I tried to get to a dealer, but only found one, 
&gt; in Ireland,
&gt; on a Sunday (closed).

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Brian Verbeek from the list as well as the Netherlands was kind enough
&gt; to go to his local VW dealer and get me an assortment of T4 brochures.
&gt; My collection now includes catalogues from the US, Germany, Norway and
&gt; the Netherlands.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, the Norwegian and Dutch TRANSPORTER catalogues list a
&gt; Double Cab VAN (as well as pick up)! The van has a &quot;wall&quot;
&gt; behind the middle seat. This wall also blocks out part of
&gt; the area behind the rear seat where passengers would step
&gt; to go to the third seat, effectively sealing off a separate
&gt; compartment in the rear, accessable through the rear hatch
&gt; only. This version is available in both the short and long
&gt; wheelbase bodies.
&gt; 
&gt; The Kombi is alive and well in the T4. As with the Kombi
&gt; of old the Kombi has plain rubber mats, and plain pressboard
&gt; type of interior wall and roof trim. There are a number of
&gt; Kombi versions...twin rear door...7,8,9 and 10 passenger
&gt; versions...low roof...high roof...etc...etc..
&gt; 
&gt; There is even a section in the Dutch catalogue showing what
&gt; one can do with a cab and bare framed T4 ... recycling
&gt; truck...box van...and even a pastry store on wheels!!
