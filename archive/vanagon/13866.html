Subject: Re: Kelly Park Show - April 9th

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you going to Kelly Park this year?
&gt;
&gt;
 and used to drive by Tait occassionally to show people what a 21-window was
and notice that you are no longer there.  

No offense Aaron, but one of the reasons I got out of Los Gatos was because
my VW's were constantly being vandalized.  Now you tell me you would bring
people by to look at my bus!!.....and they tell two friends and so on and so
on.......That doesn't make me feel too good.

I moved just outside L.G. and let me tell you the crime rate is far below
that of L.G. I can go to sleep at night and not worry about my stereo being
ripped off right out of my VW in my drive way!!

&gt;
&gt;For all:
&gt;
&gt;On April 9th at Kelly Park just outside of downtown San Jose there is a VW
show, 
&gt;probably one of the first in No-Cal for the season.  (Last weekend there was a 
&gt;SOTO meet in Long Beach, but I heard it was pretty small.)
&gt;
&gt;The Kelly Park show has continued to grow and get better each year.  I highly 
&gt;recommend it.  I think it's $5 to walk in, $10 for a vehicle including the 
&gt;driver.  I'm not sure if swap space is $20 or $30.  
&gt;
&gt;If anyone needs more details, let me know.  I've got the flyer at home and can 
&gt;relay all of the info.
&gt;
&gt;Good to hear from you Brendan!  Still getting out on the mt. bike at all?  I'm 
&gt;the guy you met up off of Shannon Rd. a couple of years ago.  Still working on 
&gt;that beat up Deluxe you saw.  It's coming along.
&gt;
