Rich,
As a coincidence, I interviewed the young lady responsible for designing the
http://www.mapquest_dot_com web site on Monday 3/4/96. Pretty talented lady.
Nice portfolio. during our totally professional conversation she mentioned
that she has been looking for a westy for some time. Small world huh?
