&gt; you will get offers varying from obsurd to damn enticing.  If you trade your
&gt; car in you will always get stiffed in the process one way or another.

i agree. you can't get a fair deal from car dealers. i used to work as a 
mechanic at a car dealership when i was 16. i got to know some of the 
salesman. they used to tell each other stories about what they did. it's 
not pretty.

i attribute alot of my current pessamism to my early exposure to these 
people.

i can assure you, they have no respect for you, and will tell you 
anything to get all they can out of the sale. 

the stories about what happens with trade-ins were the most revealing. 
not only do they not give you what the trade-in is worth, but they make 
sure that you end up paying MORE because you put them through the hassle 
of takeing your old car.

they REALY don't want that old thing. no matter what they say to you.

put a for sale sign in the window, or an add in the paper.
