Subject: Re: Results from a compression test.

As Monty Python put it :this parrot's dead.  This engine is a goner.  It
has passed on and joined the choir invisible. No compression in 2 cylinders
is a sign that something is critically wrong.  Rebuild it or get a new
engine.

&gt;I finally got around to giving my '77 westy a compression test.  I took it
&gt;off the road in December due to a steady loss of power (it was maxing out
&gt;at around 5 mph in the end).  The compression test read 110# for cylinders
&gt;1 and 2.  0# for cylinders 3 and 4.
