                      RE&gt;Insurance Companies Rated by Consumer...    10/4/95

[deleted]

These ratings are based on responses to Consumer Union's 1994 Annual
Questionnaire.  Almost 34,000 readers participated in the survey.  Buy the
October 1995 issue of CR for more details.  They also evaluate car batteries
and portable heaters in this issue, among many other items.

Consumer Reports October 1995 issue ranks the auto insurance companies in
the following order, based on how each company handled the readers' claims,
from best to worst overall:

1.  Amica Mutual
2.  United Services Auto Assn. (USAA)
3.  USAA Casualty

=============================

Note that USAA is only open to Active, Retired, and /or former Officers of the
United States Armed Forces.  &quot;Once a member, always a member&quot; regardless of
military status.

 I believe that USAA Casualty is a separate but related company,
established/sponsored by USAA,  to insure dependents of USAA members once they
are in a position to desire/need their own policies in-lieu of coming under
the coverage of their family's USAA coverage.

I have had USAA do all my insurance, auto,  and homeowner for 20+ years.  I
have been very satisfied with their service, and believe that their rates are
&quot;as good as it gets&quot;.
