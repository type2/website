Hey, let's put these guys on the vanagon list ourselves!

I bet it would blow their minds to see editorial 2,000 times more in depth
than they ever print about Vanagons themselves.

It might even inspire them to excerpt the &quot;Best Of Vanagon List&quot; each month
for a special page in their magazine.

At the very least it would raise consciousness in their minds that there
*are* vw vans made in the 1980s.
