Subject: Re[2]: VW Customer Relations &amp; reality check

&gt;generators soon. Maybe we should start destroying old cars, then we might
&gt;feel better about Witbank (wry grin, with a tear)

I have to agree with you entirely here.  We *do* need better public transit
systems, and we *should* start destroying old cars (or forcing them to
upgrade to new engines.)

    Yikes!  I'm against &quot;destroying old cars.&quot;  People ask me about driving
    an old VW and how much it polutes from time to time.

    I usually tell them that in 10 years their car will be rotting away in
    a junkyard and they will be on their third car while I will still be
    driving the same old VW.  This leads to a discussion of how much
    polution is generated by the production of the vehicle as opposed to
    the operation of the vehicle.  I think driving the old VW and not
    buying a new card every 3-5 years is good for the global environment.
