Subject: The Digital Clock

Hello;  I have an 87 GL whose digital clock constantly cycles the hours in
24 hour mode.  The minutes count out the time faithfully, and accurately.
The adjusting holes,  the right one feels okay the left one feels like an
oil can or a frog clicker, push it in click, let it out click.  I'll soon
have to remove the dash to repair the heater fan,  so if there is any thing
else I can repair while I'm in there I'd like to know.   TIA Larry Carter
