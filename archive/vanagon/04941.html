&gt; Has anyone ever removed the top from a Westfalia? I mean the whole unit,
&gt; tent and all;
&gt; right off the body. If for example you wanted to repaint the whole van or
&gt; clean the darn thing; removing the roof would be the way to go. Just
&gt; wondering - DC
&gt; 

	David, I suspect yer already hip to this, but, in case yer not:

	The fat shop manual I bought at the dealer (I think it's a Bentley
	pub. from MA)(big green book) has very explicit instructions &amp; diagrams
	on all the camper stuff.
