I concur with the choice of the Eurovan as my first pick.

Not only does it fit VERY well into the utilitarian categories, it can and 
does hold itself well in other areas also.

As a passenger-van or 'people-mover' going to the country club, 
picnic-ground, church or beach ... it performs well and looks good.

Manuevering (sp) among the larger units carrying the same number of people 
or cargo, it's a winner. Compared to the smaller vans for the same tasks 
its a sure winner!

Dollar-for-dollar and pound-for pound, I believe I got more 'bang for my 
buck'!

The flexibility for 'doing things' with the Eurovan and configuring the 
available space, works well within my 'creative juices'.

Even considering the issue of the tires that I posted here recently, a year 
later, I'm still happier with this vehicle than I've been with any other 
van!

The support I got (and am getting) from the VW dealer network has been much 
better than any I received from the dealer netowrks for any other vehicle 
I've had. I don't mean to claim or infer that this support is anywhere near 
perfect but I have significantly fewer gripes, complaints or 'wish-list' 
items than in the past and with other manufacturers. I can imagine this may 
be of much less importance to others but since we travel a lot and plan to 
increase our travels, it's important to us that the 'network' agree and 
perform consistently; if there's a problem several thousand miles from our 
home-base I like the confidence that we will get reasonable assistance like 
having the same or other problem just a few miles from home.

Long-term AND long-ranged thinking and planning, I knew what I was getting 
with the Eurovan. Overall, I have not been disappointed!
