&gt; I think California would be your best bet for getting a hold of a good
&gt; running camper and the further Northeast you go, the more money could be
&gt; had for selling it back because of the no-rust factor.  The hardest part 
&gt; would be getting it smogged initially.  Ideally you would want to get one 
&gt; from someone that has already had it recently smogged so you don't have to 
&gt; go through that much hassle.  

In California it is now the law that anyone selling a used vehicle *must*
provide a smog certificate with it at the time of sale, so if you buy one
here, insist that the seller provide it.  Many people here still don't know
about this.
