Subject: Diesel verse gas?

Does anyone know where I can find information on the exhaust gas components
of diesel engines verse gas engines? I have a project bus that I am thinking
of finding a TDI to put in because of the mileage, the seemingly more
resilient design and no iginition system to get all fouled up or cut out, or
the like.
	From what I understand of diesel engines, they supposely burn more
cleanly than gas as long as the injectors are in proper functioning order.
Am I way off the mark here? Is proper functioning order something you maintain
for oh, about 100 miles of running? And because of the way the injectors are
supposed to work, you get a better dispersion of fuel which ends up giving
one a cleaner burn. Is this incorrect as well?

	Basicly, I would like an engine that spews the least amount of noxious
gases out the tailpipe as possible. Is diesel a decent candidate or am I way
off the mark? Having search the EPA web pages and the general web, I couldn't
find any discussion of diesel engine emission for either heavy trucks or
cars. Any info is greatly appreciated...
