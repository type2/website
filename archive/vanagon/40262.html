Subject: Exhaust for 84


 I just discovered cracks in two of my pipes.  The pipe that connects 
#4 &amp; #2 accross the back of the engine and the short pipe that connects
to the Catalytic converter.  The cracks go almost all the way round the pipes
so I doubt that welding is possible (??).  Any suggestions for cheap 
parts?  What is a good price?  And how easy to fix?

Thanks
