 A
&gt;  &gt;      nice option considering the dealer asks like 65$ each for the 
&gt; original
&gt;  &gt;      hubcaps.

I bought a set of bug hubcaps that fit on my steel rims very well.  Look
pretty good.  I got the idea from another Vanagon I saw where the owner
painted the steel rims the same color as the van, put the white sidewall
facing out and the chrome bug cap on the rim.  Looked really nice.  (I just
need to paint my rims and flip my tires and I'll be there....another project
to add to the list)
