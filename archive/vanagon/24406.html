Subject: Brushable Seam Sealer

	Either Joel or Bob Hoover suggested Brushable Seam Sealer
for filling the gaps between the new battery tray and the old body
metal. So I finally got that far, and this suff is cool, although not
cheap.
	The one-quart or so can cost $15.00 or so at Color-Rite, the
local body and paint place. We used cheap acid brushes to apply it
to both sides of the seams, and it sticks and appears to fill quite
well. I generously sprayed primer and one coat of top-coat on first,
so the sealer doesn't have to be the rust-barrier too. I'll top-coat
over it and that's the end of painting.

	Its like grey peanut butter, with an intense tolene smell.
Use in a well ventelated area, maybe with a mask too. The label
on the can promises that it &quot;holds brush marks like OEM finish&quot; for
those extra concours points. :)

	For my working-truck aspirations, I've been using the
Rustoleum Antique White for VW off-white, and its got more yellow
and less gray, but works well enough I think.

	Cheers!
	Bill
