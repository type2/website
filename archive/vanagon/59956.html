Subject: Re: 87 Westy needs new power locks


&gt;Thanks!  Symptoms have been several:  first, when I gave it a good washing
&gt;one day, the locks started going up and down, up and down!  This went on
&gt;for a couple of minutes until I pulled the fuse.  Seems the water got in
&gt;somehow.  I checked the driver side lock and found a tear in the rubber
&gt;accordian-type cover (above motor).  Problem resolved on its own.
&gt;
&gt;Later, pushing the driver lock down did not automatically lock the
&gt;passenger side, but if you pushed down the passenger side it DID lock the
&gt;driver side.
&gt;
&gt;So for a while, I just locked using passenger side.  The other day, I
&gt;couldn't push either lock down manually or with the key.
&gt;
&gt;Does that give you any ideas?  I'm going to try the grease suggestion from
&gt;Joel Walker and I'll look more closely at the wires.

I had problems with my door locks that turned out to be broken and/or
breaking wires at the driver's side door. The place to look is obvious,
inside the rubber sleeve of the wire loom at the cabin into the door. Be
warned, it is a real pain to get the sleeve out of its fastening points and
off of the wire loom. I found it easiest to disconnect everything inside
the door, and then pull it all out of the door, in order to get the rubber
sleeve to slip off of the section I wanted to get at. After I found the
problem, I replaced the broken wire and put several additional wires into
the loom for future problems. Other wires were showing signs of wear. Good
luck.
