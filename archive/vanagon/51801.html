Subject: 81 Vanagon

I just bought a 81 Vanagon (its a California model) here in Detroit.

The FI is not working and is missing a few parts.  I've got a two barrel 
Solex from a 914 I'm going to use for now any suggestions?  Looks fairly 
straight forward.  

What about the distributor?  Will the electronic ignition work without 
the FI. It looks like it will but ???.  Any suggestions on changing the
the distributor?

The van is a camper with a pop up top the body is great.  It needs a new 
windshield but that can wait till spring.

I would just like to get it going for now so any suggestions welcome.

Joe Davis
