Subject: Brakes (Again!)

Okay,

	When I last posted, I had bled the brakes (again) after replaceing 
two of the lines.  The brakes worked well, but after a few miles, they
started pulling again.

	Well, hell!  They stopped pulling (left) but were still hard for the 
last few days.  I would put a lot of pressure, but without a lot of
results, so I figure they were glazed and I would sand them down
when i got the opportunity... 

	Well, today I'm on my way to my new house with a load of stuff, and 
about the 8th stop sign I came to (remember, I'm in the habit pushing
fairly hard on the brakes) I hit the brakes and the damn bus nearly
puts me thru the windshield!!!!  I mean this baby STOPPED!  (good thing
I didn't put safaris in yet, or I would have run myself over!)

	I was just a little perplexed, needless to say!  What in the hell is
going on here?  Why can't I have any consistent brake activity?  The 
fluid level, BTW, doesn't seem to have dropped...

	Its hard to tell, but the way the bus stops, it would almost seem
like I only have front brakes, because it dives sorta, but I don't know if
you could get that kinda power from just the front brakes.  By power I mean
these brakes feel like the brakes in my 911!!!!

	Any help or comments always appreciated!

Thom
