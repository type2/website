Thanks for the reply, but the engine is just about toast, due to 
massive coolant leak. I went with the rebuilt because of low 
compression in all cylinders and I really don't have time to rebuild 
it, because of losing #1 cyl. in my Squareback. I'm driving about 160 
miles per day to my jobs and on days with school it works out to 
around 250 miles. The cheapest rebuilt with the best warrenty was VW
this really surprised me after buying VW only parts for this. I 
figure I can replace the engine over Thanksgiving holiday and the 
weekend.
