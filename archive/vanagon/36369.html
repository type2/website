Subject: Re: VIN No. on Single Cab

the vin number on a 64 single cab is in the same place as any split- look in
the engine compartment on the right side on the fire wall there is a metal
plate.  Maybe your need to get out a scrub brush and clear off the gook and
tar.   

hey - a little advice to anyone with the solid engine brace used on buses
produced before the beginning of 64- this means any with the pullout front
oor handles.  If you have the brace there, dont let the inspector close the
engine lid, or theyll bend the brace.  :(
