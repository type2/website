Subject:       Moose

I have a friend who nicked and thought he killed a deer (looked like a 
moose) Let's say a 71 camper with a tire on the front 
for VW content and to make the story believable. They put the 
deer in the back cause they did not want to waste the meet.  Only to 
find out after drivin away, the darn thing weren't 
dead.
