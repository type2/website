&gt;Okay.  My vote is for a piece of badly colored flannel (something vw-like)
&gt;with a prune silkscreened onto it.  You could tie it to your
&gt;antennae or hang it from your mirror, or attach it inside of your back
&gt;hatch window.
&gt;I love the obscurity.  Netfergnugen could be printed across the bottom.
&gt;Totally undiscernable to ANYONE.!  Try explaining it, eh.
&gt;&lt;grin&gt;

i like the 'Netfergnugen'. 'badly colored'?? a prune? what DID you folks do
out there at Pfeiffer!!???

&gt;Keep it simple.
&gt;I like the idea of riding around with a prune label on my bumper, but
&gt;someone with a new/restored Box may not...
&gt;The ascii graphic sounds good, but if we were to start to make it somehow
&gt;&quot;politically correct&quot; by including graphics of all Box types, then it gets
&gt;complicated.  Remember that it has to be something easily recognizable from
&gt;a modest distance, and at a glance - you might someday whiz past a Box
&gt;stuck in the breakdown lane at 65 mph.

&gt;Sounds good, Maybe a smaller square sticker with a graphic of the front of
&gt;a bus, similar to the decals you can get when you travel around Europe.
&gt;Then agin, maybe it would be more tasteful to just have the graphic - maybe
&gt;similar to an ASCII graphic.

suggestion: since Hannover, germany is the ancestral 'home' of the majority
of our buses (early splits were made at Wolfsburg and later at Emden, then
all production was moved to Hannover for the transporters) ... what about
a city symbol/crest/flag of Hannover?? you know, like the Wolfsburg crest
on the Limited Editions and the old beetle hoods and horn buttons?

as to ascii graphic: what about little old Mr. Bubblehead? the old pre-ascii
graphic symbol of vw service.
