Subject: My Van Stopped Going *or* Case of the CV Dropoff

hey now,

well, here i was driving home from work last night...cruising along in the
sleet and snow...kinda toasty, not too cold. stopped at a stop sign..always
a good thing...went to go...but my van no go. had the van in gear, no go. let
the clutch up all the way..engine still running in first gear...*uhoh*

so i hope out..and of course can't find my flashlight! :P. so, i crawl under
the front end...with a lighter, thinking the clutch line broke but then
realized that couldn't be it since i was in first gear..well, something was
wrong...nothing i could tell up front. so i crawl out, soaking wet with a bit
of cold creeping in da bones....and crawl under the back, from in front of the
driver's side wheel, head first. i get under the van and *boink* almost hit my
head on the transaxle...which is hanging off...the inside cv joint which bolts
to the driveshaft had come off! doh! i lie there for a couple of seconds assess
ing the situation..while a steady trickle of water runs down  my back and on
down the road.

well, all the bolts were there, i put it on the best i could in the dark and
limped the remaining 6 blocks home. question: i replaced the cv joints and
boots in july i think. they were on therre tight...how did that on cv joint
come off? the next day i really tightened it on...then check the others and
they were on nice and tight...very strange...very very strange.
