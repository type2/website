&gt;&gt; Reheating Pizza is easy too.  The main trick is profiling you engine
&gt;&gt; compartment thermally with a thermometer so you know what the steady 
state
&gt;&gt; temperatures are so you don't over or undercook.
&gt;
&gt;So you have a temp gauge on your bus just for the roast?

The heat exchangers work great for popcorn, too. Just pull the heater
hoses in the engine compartment and dump it in. For faster popping,
don't reconnect them-- just cap so the engine cooling air isn't lost.
Butter on the left and cheese-flavor on the right works for me.  :)

Limited capacity, tho, and a little tough to get it out. And you DON'T
want to put in too much! Turns your back seat into an ejection seat.

A side bennie: some engines supply their own cooking oil. Yum!

Is it Friday yet?
