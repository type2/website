So Joel Walker says:
&gt; well, you draw this laaarrrrgggge circle on the floor ...  well, anyway, it
&gt; involves some goats and a chicken and a whole bunch of candles.  and at least
&gt; one hubcap. or carburetor. hmmm. i wonder if a brakedrum would work ...
&gt; 

Hmmmm...   Reminds me of the recent episode of 'Frasier' wherein they
were talking about Frasier's greedy agent and someone wondered how
he got a hold of her as she was only around when there was a monetary
opportunity.  And Niles quips, &quot;I thought you just drew a pentogram
on the floor and chanted 'I summon thee' 3 times.&quot;
