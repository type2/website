Subject: Re: my answers to the EV questions

&gt; BTW, any of you EVers out there contemplating how to find out if you have
&gt; the piston slap problem - before the warranty runs out?  I think mine sounds
&gt; OK, and I'm afraid the dealer would ruin my engine if they started fooling
&gt; around with it.  Scary....

I've been trying to get the dealer to acknowledge that it might have the 
problem.  But so far everytime I have service at the dealer (15,000 mile 
for example) They write on their form that it isn;t there.  I'm going to 
check with a couple other dealers to get opinions this summer before I 
cross the power train warranty line.
