Subject: Re: Does air cond.=hp loss?

I bought an '87 with the a/c belt removed, the PO told me that he took the
belt off to save power. It turned out that he took the the belt off because
the compressor blew up. Turned out to be an expensive surprise to me. The
only time I need to turn the a/c off is going up the steeper grades going to
Lake Tahoe. Otherwise it's power drain is barely noticeable.
