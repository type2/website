Hey Ya'll

Glad to see the list back up!
I was wondering if anyone has ordered a rebuilt engine from GEX
International
out of California?  A neighbor of mine put one in his bug and has put ove=
r
70,000 miles on it and it runs strong.  I have visited their website and
have
their catalog and they seem to have a very good set up.  Has anyone order=
ed
one of the engines and if so did you ever have to test out their garantee=
=2E
 Before I lay down 2 grand I'd like some feedback. =

  By the by, I've have a 80 Vanagon Camper with the 2.0 aircooled engine.=

 GEX offers either a 2.0 stock rebuilt or what they call a Power Master
series 2.0 with Mahl pistons and Cylinders, 44mm intake - 38mm exhaust
valve
heads (oversized), Torque special cam,new hyd lifters,resurfaced flywheel=
,
steel push rods and new rod tubes for an extra 400 bucks.  Is it worth th=
e
extra bread and what would the extra performance or life of this engine b=
e?

If anyone has any input I would be grateful.

Carpediem,

Don
