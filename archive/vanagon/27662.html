    With regard to the book &quot;Why Trade It In?&quot;, I can recommend a couple of
    other books you may find interesting:
    
    The Geography of Nowhere : the rise and decline of America's man-made
    landscape / James Howard Kunstler, Simon &amp; Shuster, 1993
    ISBN 0-671-70774-4
    usually indexed under: Architecture - Environmental Aspects - United States
    
    this a description of the history of urban/suburban landscape, and
    discusses the role that the automobile has played in its formation.

It is more than that, and I, for one,
have not read anything better in some
time.  Highly recommended/seconded.
