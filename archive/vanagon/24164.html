So Rusty VanBondo says:

&gt; &gt;I remember getting the stuffing slapped out of me by my mother (on the way
&gt; to Mass/Catholic church services) after reading this unfamiliarword painted

Yup, I remember them days of innocent comments that got my ass hauled
away quickly for immediate *ahem* re-education. ;)  

One time my great grandmother (moms side of the family) came over with
my grand parents.  She was wearing a long black dress and had white hair.
Well me, being into Halloween and all, I piped up and said, &quot;she looks like
a witch.&quot;  I don't think my feet even touched the ground on that one all
the way to the bedroom. :O

Another time, those same grandparents used to bring us boys (6 of us) a 
little can of pennies (with some dimes and nickles sprinkled in) and they
gave us the can to divide between us.  Well one time they came and I guess I'd
got used to grandfather handing us the can each time.  When he hadn't for
a while, I asked, &quot;Did you bring any money?&quot; Woofff! I was wisked off again
to the bedroom for some more education.  That's board of education for
those of you not so enlightened. ;)
