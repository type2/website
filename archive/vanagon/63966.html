&gt; Mark,
&gt; 
&gt; Regarding your speeding ticket, I'd be glad to help. I'm sure I can cut a 
&gt; deal with the authorities so that you would only have to spend 5 years in 
&gt; the state lock-up. Please advise.

DUDE!
I figured a high-powered East Coast Attorney such as yourself,
particularly seeing our kinship in the produce of the Fatherland, might
to be able to do much better. I'll pass on your offer to retain you,
think I'll just find me a lo-tech country Bubba-Lawyer related to the
judge.
