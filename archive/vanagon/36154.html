Subject: Electric Van Conversions?


I don't see a lot of sense in converting a bus or microbus. The limitations
of electric car technology are limitations of electricity storage, not
motor capacity; batteries are still too heavy. The way to address this is
not by loading more batteries in a heavier vehicle (making it heavier
still); it is to ask as little of the storage capacity as possible. That
means lightening the load. We're on the wrong end of the technology curve
to consider converting trucks that were designed to haul cargo.

This is just conjecture, but I can see a lightened (glass-bodied) Beetle
being feasible as an electric commuter. Maybe a Ghia. The electric motor is
surprisingly small and bolts straight to the trans, which means you could
fit a good many batteries into the engine compartment and more under the
rear seat. Three or four up front.

The fact that the trunk is in the front doesn't make any difference, does
it? Because the Beetle's gas tank is in the front, too. Front-engine cars
carry their gas in the rear, so it's just an inversion. As long as you
didn't substantially exceed the weight of a full gas tank (and that's not
light), it wouldn't require modifying the suspension.

But the fact that the VW aircooled is so light actually argues against it
in that regard; a cast-iron monoblock is equivalent in weight to many more
batteries than a magnesium case, so you might have to beef up the rear
suspension in the Beetle.

I'd go for maybe an MG Midget (Lord knows, you could replace their engines
with anything including rubber bands and it'd be an improvement). ;) I
think it weighs about 1300 total. Two seater, some space for batteries
behind the seats if I remember. Wouldn't have to worry about breaking the
propellor shaft anymore. ;)
