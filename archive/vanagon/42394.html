Subject: syncro driveline (want)

HI all
 
     Does anyone have a syncro driveline they would like to sell. It dosn't
have to have good joints,or any joints for that matter, Heck, it dosn't even
have to be streight! If you do please let me know.
                                                                            
                   Thanks
