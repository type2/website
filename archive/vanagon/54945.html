&gt; &quot;Marbles in a tin can&quot; is the classic sound of an engine pinging.  Have

Sounds like pinging to me too.  If it is a GTi then it has knock sensors
that should retard the timing to prevent such early detonation.  I'm not
sure if a normal Golf would have knock sensors...I think they have a lower
compression ratio.  Sooo, I'd suggest having your son A) buy a Bentley
($35), and B) use it to check the knock sensors, if equipped.  Of course
this isn't what you were asking about, but I'm afraid I don't know any VW
mechanics in AZ:(
