&gt;I just went to see Independence Day and I wanted to complain about the lack of 
&gt;VW's.  They showed an orange Beetle while New York was being blown up but
that was 
&gt;about it.  Now usually this is not unusual but in this particular movie
they had 
&gt;scenes with hundred of campers driving across the desert.  I had hear about
this 
&gt;scene and figured &quot;what a great oppurtunity to show a bunch of 'long hairs' in 
&gt;their splits and loaves camping while the world is being destroyed&quot;.  But
not a 
&gt;one.
&gt;
&gt;/end rant

 In the scene right when the campers pulled up in front of the bunker after
scurrying across the flats at the beginning of the fighter attack there is a
shot looking out from the bunker as people are scrambling out of the campers
I thought that I saw (just for an instant) a tan vanagon not a camper in the
extreme right of the frame. Of course it could have been a halucination
brought on by butter and salt poisoning. 

See ya on the road
