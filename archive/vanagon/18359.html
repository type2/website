Subject: Wanted: Syncro rear diff/misc.

Would list members who are in better equipped parts of the world please keep 
an eye out for any Syncro being parted out. I would like to buy a locking 
type transaxle (cheaply!).  Any Canadian members, please let me know as I 
also need components for the gas H2O-heater that is unique to Canadian 
Syncros. Life is getting real difficult hereabouts.  TIA.    tim s.
