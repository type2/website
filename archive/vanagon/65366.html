Brad &amp; Jim -

I'll be there too.  It's only a 14 hour drive from Redding &lt;grin&gt;.  Last
time I checked I was still a CCCer, even though I haven't had the chance
yet to camp out with the volks of the group.

It would be neat if someone had a laptop to connect and issue reports
every few hours to the list(s) on the happenings.

&gt;Well, at least I plan on going (of the CCC group).  I think I'll camp
&gt;with
&gt;Jim since I don't think anyone else from the CA camping group is
&gt;serious.
&gt;I just did my CV joints today for the drive.  Someone from from IRC
&gt;channel #VW said they'll come from Phoenix if I go.
&gt;
&gt;We should have an Internet camp there.  I plan on getting there
&gt;sometime
&gt;Friday.  I'm open for a caravan from the bayarea, but I want to do
&gt;some
&gt;other things, ya know... be one with the wind and all.
