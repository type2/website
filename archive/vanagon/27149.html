Subject: Re: Tailgators

mark&gt; The July issue of the NEATO newsletter described installing an
mark&gt; old windshield washer with its nozzle pointing into the carb.
mark&gt; With the washer filled with diesel fuel, a good squirt will send
mark&gt; a huge cloud of greasy black smoke into the tailgator's face.
        Intriguing...could someone perhaps post this mod? I like it-it'll
just look like I need to replace the rings when I'm gettin' 'em. I already
do this in my '78 Dodge truck. It needs rings bad, so when I punch it I get
a glorious cloud of oil-great fun for tailgaters and others who annoy me.
Has enough power to get in front of those who cut me off, and get revenge
too. Not so good for the truck though...   :-(

Peace,
