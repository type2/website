&gt; ok. first, that engine (the type 4 engine) was not in production for just
&gt; three years. it was first introduced in 1969 in the porsche 914. the 1983
&gt; air-cooled bus was the last evolved model of that engine. so the production
&gt; run was more like 14 years, during which time the displacement grew from
&gt; 1.7 liter to 2.0 liter, and the valve lifters became hydraulic (no more
&gt; setting the valves every 3000 miles) in about 1978. the engine in the 1980-
&gt; 1983 vanagons is the same engine as in the 1978-1979 buses. fuel injection
&gt; is the same as well. actually, the only 'difference' between the 1979 bus
&gt; and the 1980 vanagon is the entire body and suspension. :) the engine and
&gt; transmission are the same.

Ummm... close, but not exactly.  If I remember from my rebuilding books, the
Vanagon has different heads with rectangular exhaust ports (and probably 
other differences, maybe valve size?) starting in 1980.
