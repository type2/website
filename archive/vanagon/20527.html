Subject:       Re: Vanagon: Bosch Platinums?

Hello Tim.  I just put in some Bosch Platinums in April in my '90 
Syncro 2.1L.  They are GREAT!!

The number is:  WR7CP.  Get them at Canadian Tire.. they don't even 
have them referenced properly!!  I got the numbers from the Bosch 
Ignition Catalogue that lists the x-reference.  CT has to bring them 
in .. takes a couple days or so.. they go for around $4.26 each.  
Other FLAPs have them for nearly $20 EACH!!  The plugs for the van 
are not even on CT's cheap list... a low volume plug I am told, hence 
the high price. :(

The Platinums really work... great cold starting, and they shouldn't 
wear much.

Harry.

&gt; Can someone tell me the model # of Bosch Platinum spark plugs for my '87 
&gt; 2.1litre Syncro. The dealer can't, can you? Our local cheesy autoparts 
&gt; supplier gave me a number, and will have to order them in, hence the double 
&gt; check. All other platinums are $5.99/pair, he wants $4.35/each for mine, can 
&gt; you spell VW? ,he can!  tia  tim s.
