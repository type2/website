Toby, that's not been my experience (or maybe I'm doing something
wrong).  I replaced the outer torsion bar bushings on the rear of my
Square with the polyurethane ones from Bugpack, and have had a terrible
squeak ever since.  Is there some magical lube I can put on these
babies, or should I replace the inners too, and that might fix it.  I
had trouble getting the spring plates off to do the inners (I think
Craig Woolston had mentioned the same problem, but I wasn't around to
hear the answer), meaning I couldn't get them off.  I know it's a
repeat, but can anyone tell me how to get the spring plates off of my
'71 Squareback?
