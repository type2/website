Subject:      Re: Vanagon Wheel Covers

if anyone wants to put a set of the 86-91 plastic wheel covers on their
buses (and they will fit any bus from 1971 through 1991 with steel wheels),
Hella makes a set that are almost identical ... they just have &quot;Hella&quot;
instead of &quot;VW&quot; on them. last time i looked, they were retailing for about
$100 for a set of four.

now the bad news: not all Hella dealers want to fool with them. so you may
have to search a bit to find them. but now, at least, you know they exist. :)
