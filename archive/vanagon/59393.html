Subject: Re: A/C Compressor Info

The VW Vanagons originally used Standen 510 (I think) compressors.  A/C
compressors are actually pretty standard, but the VW one has different
connections than most Standen's.   Any A/C compressor re-builder can rebuild
your unit, though as Standen parts are quite common.  The other alternative
is that you can have new, different, fitting swedged onto your A/C lines
and replace the pump with other more interesting variants.  VW itself did
this, since the early pump is not available any longer.

I'm actually surprised that a Peugeot pump was a Standen unit, as they used
AC/Delco stuff usually.  Could be, though.  Finding Peugeot parts makes finding
Vanagon stuff simple -- although I think they are unloved and so may be junked
more readily in the US.

In Europe (and in most of the world) Peugeot's are ubitquious -- and really
pretty easy to find.  For those of you who hate VWoA, you should have tried
to deal with the US Peugeot company.  Back when the 205 was the hottest little
car in the world, they did not choose to import it to the US -- only those
clunky 405's.  Now they are gone altogether.  I think Peugeot is at least as
big as VW worldwide.  Count your blessings that VW did not abandon us
altogether like Peugeot did (and with them took Citroen, also not available
in the US).  We lament that VW does not choose to import so many of their
bus models, but they could have pulled out completely, so there are small
blessings.  Peugeot's are quite fine cars really, but abominable dealers
and parts supplies made owning one in the US a real trial.  Kinda like
owning an EV.
