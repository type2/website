Subject: Different Starting Woes

Greetings -

Thanks to all those who responded to my last call for assistance.  Sure
enough, Joel, it was condensation in the fuel.  

My '80 Westy is running great now with the exception of another bug that
has crept in....when the engine is hot after running for a while, if I
shut it off, run into the store and grab a lotto ticket, come back out,
it will not start and has difficulty in turning over at all. Let it sit
and cool down for 10 or 15 minutes and away she goes.

I'm told this is the signe of a starter heading south.  At $210 a pop
for a replacement, I'm not impressed.  Any other possibilities out
there...like maybe coil?

Regards,
