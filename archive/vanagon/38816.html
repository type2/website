Subject: 1976 Camper Van

 1976 VW Camper van - good condition, has been in storage for the winter,
 some rust on bottom edges - new engine, new tires, new front beam &amp; axle -
 some electrical work done, new horn, new battery, new etc. etc. - lots of
 extras - sink and cooler inside, screens intact on pop top (not the cheese
 wedge type, lots of room in this one!) back seat folds out into bed, has
 electrical port on side, interior lights, etc.  I have all records of
 repairs - asking $2,000 - have put $5,000 in - must sell soon - call for
 details if interested (614) 268-0390 after 7:00pm or leave message.  This
 bus would be beautiful restored, but I do not have the time, money or
 mechanical skills/inclination to do it.  Hoping to sell it to someone who
 does - she's a good bus and has served me well.
