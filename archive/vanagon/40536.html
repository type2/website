Subject: Corvair engines

To All:

This is general information about the Corvair powerplant, provided at the
request of a list member.  I've made it a general post since it may be of
interest to anyone considering a transplant for their Type IV engine.

-----

If you want to see what a Corvair engine looks like, go find a Type IV.
 There are marked similarities -- VW obviously picked off a few of the best
points from the Corvair.  But not all.

The six cylinder Corvair powerplant weighs about the same as the Type IV if
you include the exhaust systems, which are much heavier on the Volkswagen.
 The Corvair engine displaced about 165 cubic inches, a bit shy of 2.7
liters.  Bore and stroke was, I think, 87mm by 75mm and the engine was very
conservatively rated at 95 hp _at_ 3,600 rpm, ideal for a stock-geared VW bus.
 It was fitted with dual carbs that mounted directly to the heads, the
manifold being part of the head casting.  With a different cam and rev'd to
about four grand, the basic engine produced 110 hp.  It also came in a
four-carb model that was rated at 140 hp at something like 5,500 rpm, again
with a different cam being fitted.  Then there was the Spyder, a
turbosupercharged version that would only make you feel bad if I told you how
many horses it put out.

The Corvair mad a wizard little aircraft engine because max torque was down
around 2,400 rpm, ideal for converting rotary motion to thrust using a
propellor.  

Best of all, the engine was smooth and reliable.  Purists turned their noses
up at the four-main bearing crankcase but the case was aluminum, not
magnesium, and the bearings were sustained by thru-bolts rather than studs.
 The close proximity of the cam, nestled underneath the crankshaft, put a
limit to how much stroking you could do, which was also limited by the small
rod journals, only 45mm or so.  But you could hang some really huge jugs on
the thing.  And because the cooling blower was belt-driven, you could cool a
big-bore Corvair just by changing the fan (more vanes) or the drive-belt
ratio (different pulleys) or both.

The Corvair engine consists of two crankcase shells, left &amp; right, but
differs from the Type IV in that the basic casting is machined on all sides.
 The bell housing bolts to the front, a sump to the bottom, a cover plate to
the top -- which mounted the blower on a central pivot -- and an accessory
case to the rear.  The accessory case included the distributor, oil pump, oil
filter and oil cooler.  Design-wise, the closest thing to it today is one of
Larry Pauter's racing engines.

The tin-ware of the Corvair is less complex than either the Type IV or the
upright VW engine, nor are there as many pieces.  But the shrouding was much
better than on an upright VW engine and was copied almost directly onto the
Volkswagen Type IV.  And instead of one thermostat as on VW engines, Corvairs
had two, one for each bank of three cylinders.  The thermostats controlled
the heated air outlets whereas VW controls the cooling air at the inlets.
 Different strokes.

The heads are perhaps the most similar part between Type IV's and Corvairs.
 Not in their rockers, which are far superior on the American engine, but in
their pattern of cooling fins and method of inserting O-ringed pushrod tubes
through the valve galleries. But the Corvair valve cover was bolted-on rather
than held by a bail, largely because you never needed to visit the rockers
unless you were doing a repair -- no valve adjustment required with the
Corvair, which was equipped with hydraulic cam followers.

Thanks to putting the distributor and oil pump in an accessory housing, basic
repairs to a Corvair were relatively easy since the accessory housing was
accessible without dropping the engine.  But if you needed to do a Corvair
engine, it wasn't much more difficult than doing a Bug.  Different but not
difficult.  The trick was, you needed an overhead hoist.  You used it to hike
up the back of the car -- just grab the bumper in slings, the unibodied
chassis was very rigid -- raise the vehicle, skivvie under and do the
disconnects, put the jack in place and lower the car until the tranny was on
the jack, skivvie back under and pull the bolts, then just lift the body up,
lower the jack, and pull out the engine and tranny as a unit.  The axles were
fitted with old-fashioned U-bolts at the tranny side-plates and came away
with loosening just four nuts, plus the anti-torque tube and a few other
goodies.  It wasn't very hard and you didn't need a very strong hoist -- we
used a children's swing-set to drop a Corvair engine without problems.  As
with most American vehicles, the fasteners were robust, considerably
over-sized for the work.

But unless you were doing an engine swap, chances were you didn't need to
drop the engine.  The Corvair deck lid gave you complete access to the top of
the powerplant and there was nothing buried beneath the tinware -- the
generator (early models) or alternator (later) was hanging right out there in
the open, as was the distributor, carbs and dip stick.  Of course, the
four-carb engine an the turbo filled up the space but the basic Corvair was
an easy machine to maintain -- if you understood air-cooled engines.

An interesting note about the Corvair tranny was its use of a hollow output
shaft.  That is, the mainshaft from the engine ran through the center of the
output shaft to the differential.  This allowed the Corvair to be several
inches lower than the VW powertrain yet could provide about the same ground
clearance with tires of equal size.

I liked the Corvair engine.  I owned three of the things and never had a
problem I couldn't fix.  They were fast yet economical, if you didn't have to
run the gas heater too much.  An the Spyder would flat EAT any Porsche alive.
 The fastest run I ever made -- better than 200 miles averaging over 130 mph
on public roads -- was made in a Corvair Spyder. And no, it wasn't a Las
Vegas cruz -- the run started in San Francisco.  

Installation of a Corvair engine in a bug was a bit much, and they didn't do
all that well in the early bus -- install a Corvair engine and the next thing
you'd install would be tranny, to replace the one you'd cracked.  But if you
installed the entire powertrain -- a Herculean task -- you had a
great-running machine because the Corvair tranny was one tough piece of
goods.  And if you installed a Corvair engine in a late bus having a rear
engine mount, you had just about the best bus you could have.

Oddly enough, you still see Corvairs for sale, usually for less than a
Volkswagen of similar vintage.  The kicker is, it's hard to find parts for
them.  But a running Corvair for $500 usually means a rebuildable engine at a
dirt-cheap price.  

If you're interested in Corvairs, the same fellow that wrote 'How to Hotrod
Volkswagens'  did a similar book on Corvairs, although it is long out of
print.
