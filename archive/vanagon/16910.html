Subject: Re:  Best Vanaogon Brake Pad

So then, Steven says:

&gt;I've had brake dust from day one of owning my van and have never heard
&gt;of other pads that don't. I really prefer OEM brakes for all of my cars
&gt;
&gt;(text deleted)
&gt;
&gt;I used some of that anti-squeal/squeek goop on the back of my pads and it
&gt;seems to keep them from making any noise. You might try it on your next
&gt;pad change.


Unlike Joel's experience with Repco pads, I had pretty decent luck with 
the Repco Metalmasters on the front (albeit not on a Vanagon).  No squeal,
no dust.

Yo, Rich S, if you want some of that &quot;anti-squeal/squeek goop&quot; that Steven
mentioned above, send me your snail mail addr. and I'll GIVE you a couple
packets that I have, but never used

Next time around, I think I'll try the Mintex semi-metallic pads that I've
heard good things about.  Has anyone on the list had any experience with
this product?
