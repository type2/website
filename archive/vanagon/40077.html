&gt;Does anyone know where I can get replacement seals?  The parts houses in the
&gt;Milwaukee area don't carry the seals nor the replacement racks.  The dealers
&gt;say they don't replace seals any more, as the labor charges equal the cost
&gt;of a remanufactured rack. [$430 rack + $130 labor]

Usually when the rack leaks, seals are not the major problem.  The bushings
at the end are worn leaving enough play for the rack to move that the seals
will no loger hold.  The bushings need to be replaced and the rack needs to
be refininished to remove al the grooves and scratches.  This is why rebuilt
racks cost so much.  Find a local rebuilder that can rebuild yours and get a
guarantee or find a company that specializes in rack repair.  Try looking in
Hemmings.
