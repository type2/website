Subject: Anybody need '73 carburetors?
Date: Tue, 23 Jan 1996 09:22:25 -0600 (CST)

Hello

This last Saturday I followed up on a tip of a couple weeks ago and 
went to check out a 'new' '73 bus at the local import auto salvager.  
At present he only has about two and they are well picked over.  All 
of the others went to the crusher.  I got myself a handful 
of switches and do-dads from the interior and then figured I would 
check out the engine.  It was mostly covered in oil but it did have a 
pair of carburetors still bolted on.  I do believe they had Solex 
stamped somewhere on there.  I can't say for sure.  About 
three days later it dawns of me that someone might want these things 
if the price is right.  Hell, the whole motor is there.  That would 
probably be out of the question, however.  If anyone shows any interest I
could make a call about the carbs.  I could do the pull and mail 
routine.  Jim
