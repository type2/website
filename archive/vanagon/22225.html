Subject: RE: 6-cylinder Vanagon kit


&gt;Recent shopping expedition leaves me with most of the pieces you need to
&gt;put a six in your Vanagon.  Available as a package for $2000:
&gt;2.2liter 911T engine, 1971, 4000 mi. on new valves
&gt;oil tank
&gt;adapter flywheel to put engine in Vanagon
&gt;CD ignition
&gt;plans for rear engine brace


Aiieeeee... I would give my left nut to put that package into my
'71 bus. And the price even seems reasonable, considering what
911 engines are going for nowadays. But, $2K is more than I paid
for the entire bus... and represents the last of my &quot;fun cash&quot;
for a while...

Enviously,
