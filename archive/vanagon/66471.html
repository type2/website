Subject:      Another Radio install question!

Me again...

what's this behind the factory radio, it's like something on the rear
end holding or supporting the  radio? I haven't taken it out yet, but
from the looks of whatever's bolted to the read end, I dunno if I can?


can someone give me the dimensions of the stereo so I can measure the
Cd Player, I dunno if it'll fit as it is either.

ill shut up now..you're all probably sick of me by now and my radio
woes........
