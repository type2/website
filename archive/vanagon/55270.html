Subject: Dist Driveshaft Installation ?


If your engine is at TDC, and ...

if you install your distributor driveshaft 180 degrees out, can you simply
change the placement of your spark plug wires (on the dist cap) to
compensate for the new firing order ?  That is move the #1 plug 
wire to what would normally be the #3 lead on the dist cap. Will/Should
the engine run ? 

Just curious ...

Chris
