OK gurus here's your chance for glory.

Two main topics:

Brick is 89 Syncro Westie

1.  Auxiliary RV battery (low CCA high ReserveCapacity) installation.

2.  Rear Foglight wiring and rear lens ass'y modification.

1.1 So where did you install your RV battery?

1.2 And of course where did you install the isolator and just how is the net.wisdom.best
   way to wire the critter.                

1.3 Where to break the wiring to the rear interior light and the Dometic so as to 
    run the accessories off the RV battery rather than the main starting battery.
    Physically, not electricaldiagrammarly.

1.4 Did you need a remote Voltage Regulator Sensing device?

1.5 Any other hints, kinks, tips, catastrophy avoidances, horror stories related to 
    the aux pwr system.

2.  Rear Foglight wiring and rear lens ass'y modification.

2.1 Does existing harness have wiring for rear fog?

2.2 Where and what color/diam/code is this wiring at both ends.  EG Rear of Brick and
    Under/behind dash/fuse panel.

2.3 I have the 3way switch presently wired to Bosch 100w fogs (relayed) using an 
    additional STM harness.

2.4 How did you modify your rear lens ass'y to accept a reflector for the center red
    position and how did you incorporate the additional bulb mounting hardware for the
    32cp rated bulb?  I suppose I could find a trashed ovloV and rig up something but
    I'd rather consult the net.vanagon.oracles.

2.5 Or if not 2.4 did you mount a Cibie or Bosch rear fog, if so where?  Wiring 
    questions apply here.

Thanking ye in advance, I offer the following heater option for winter camping use.

I have a Coleman LPG portable 4000btu Catalytic heater.  Nice unit, holds two bottles
of 16.4oz LPG has flameout protection and is free standing.  I can post the model if
you like but I'm not sure they're still available.  Mine was a GS item for $25.

Anyone own a MSDS Carrera six conversion?  How'd you heat your &quot;cab&quot;  Oil cooler ducting
or ??

FS:1983 Diesel Jetta 4D, Sunroof, AC, 4sp, 100kmi, arctic camoflage white urban 
   assault vehicle low blue book ~$1300.

   add $150 for new pullout am-fm-cassette not installed.

9004 100/80w halogens available _at_ ~$20 ea.  Light up the other guy's life.

How do you clean the lens reflector ass'y INSIDE for the 9004 headlights on the '89
vanagon?
