&gt;a standard trick to show a newbie in Jan or Feb, was to get a cup of hot
&gt;coffee at the mess hall, walk outside, and pitch the coffee out of the cup,
&gt;up in the air while it was about 40 below. A huge burst of steam, a
&gt;crackling
&gt;sound, and freeze-dried coffee fell all around you. Also, sometimes, the
&gt;empty mug would shatter in your hand. This tended to pi** off the cooks.


I hear (being careful of the PC pitbulls) that a similar thing happens if
one &quot;relieves&quot; oneself outside in such weather.  You tensd to do this only
once 'cause the shattered &quot;coffee mug scenario&quot; (or insert your own
euphemism) is a probable outcome.
