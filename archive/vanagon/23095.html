Subject: Re: Expected Life of Bus Cy (fwd)

&gt;I have forwarded a message from Tom Quan who had one of the valve seat
&gt;inserts work lose on his GEX engine. As there are several owners of GEX
&gt;engines on the list (including myself) and many more with non-GEX factory
&gt;rebuilt engines in their vanagons and busses, it would be useful to hear
&gt;from any who has a problem with valve seat inserts or know of the problem.
&gt;
&gt;There are several questions: a) what is the exact problem with valve seat
&gt;inserts; b) what is the most likely cause and c) what efforts can be taken
&gt;to prevent the problem?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance for any leads, information or advice.

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; David,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Mine was also a GEX rebuilt engine; one of the cylinder heads went at 25K.  
&gt;&gt; My friend's '78 bus also has a GEX and the  head went bad  at 50k miles.  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; So far, you are the first to contact me, but I'll share whatever I have.   I
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Regards,  Tom

See June 1995 Hot VWs, Page 52, &quot;Type 4 Valve Seat Replacement.&quot;

Yhis article features Type 4 Head rebuilding by:

Mark Stephens has developed his own valve seats for Type 4 and perfected 
a way to keep the seats from coming loose.  They also do quality Type 4 
engine rebuilding or will rebuild your heads and sell you a set of quality
piston/clinders, gaskets, etc. for a reasonable sum.


Good luck,
