Subject: Re: Insane Syncro Prices!!!



Re: better handling and off-road stuff:

Customers at the shop I worked for claimed that the Vanagon Syncro's
true forte was soft sand, although good handling claims were made for
snow and ice conditions as well.

On the handling issue, the syncro van seems to actually handle better
then the 2wd vanagon, as with all the extra hardware underneath it
would appear to have a better absolute center of gravity.

I've heard that the camper syncros are just a little TOO tippy, with all the
camping gear on the drivers' side.

Any more opinions?
