Ft. Collins is about 4900 feet or 85-90% of a standard atmosphere.  If you 
drive up into the Rockies that's a different ball game.  I'm sure there are 
good part stores in Ft. Collins but I can't give you any specifics.  Estes 
Park is a long 1.5 hour drive from Ft. Collins.  I would definitely 
recommend visiting Rocky Mountain National Park; if you like tourist traps 
visit Estes Park as well.  I would recommend Forest Service Campgrounds in 
Poudre Canyon (Roosevelt National Forest) or perhaps there is State Park 
Camping at Horse Tooth Reservoir.  There is no sanctioned camping on the CSU 
campus.
