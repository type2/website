Subject: Re: Mexican vehicles --HOW ABOUT SOUTH AFRICAN VANAGONS?

&gt; I've been reading about importing Vanagons every since I found out 
that
&gt; they are still being manufactured in South Africa.  How about a BRAND
&gt; NEW Vanagon with a dependable cast-iron block 5-cylinder motor (with no
&gt; problematic heads), 21 gallon (85L) gas tank, 15&quot; alloy wheels, power
&gt; remote side mirrors, plastic bumpers, and a factory 5-speed tranny?  Air
&gt; condition?--you got it!Garth,
Which side is der steerinwheelin located on, I forget on S.A., I am 
excited about this prospect, but would be less than enthusiastic with 
the driver controls on the right side.
