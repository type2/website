I had this problem, too.  Dealer MGs caused it on one of the R&amp;R Transaxle
extravaganzas.  Took several visits to convince them it was a real noise
(man, some MGs are really DEAF), but they said the heat shield bracket was
broken and it was rubbing against the pipe, producing a resonance at
certain RPMs.  Like what I told them the first time... go figure.
