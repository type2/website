Subject:      carb exchange??

I'll try this post again since yesterday's may have been lost.   A friend
of mine has a '73 bus with the standard dual carb setup.  He'd like to
replace them with a single carb, but he doesn't know if this is possible.
If it is possible, he'd like to know which carb to use.  Thanks
