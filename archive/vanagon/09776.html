Dan,
This summer I rebuilt the 2.0 litre in my '77.  Put it back in the bus
and proceeded for the next 2-1/2 hours to try to get the damn thing
started.  Couldn't get it started to save my life.  Checked compression
and all was fine except #2 read only 80psi.  Came out the next morning
and it cranked first try.  Ran engine for 30 minutes and checked the
compression again.  This time #2 read 130psi.  All I can figure is I
had flooded the engine and totally washed #2 with gas.  After sitting
overnight enough evaporated to start it. After running engine finally 
got enough oil into #2 to seal.  Don't know if this might also apply 
in your case.  Best of luck.

&gt;Hi all. We recently did a ring job and replaced the heads on my sister's
&gt;Camper's 1700 cc (type IV) engine. It has a 2bbl Weber carb on it, and
&gt;did run OK, despite having terrible compression on the cylinder 3/4 side.
&gt;After putting everything back together, we are unable to start the van.
&gt;There is good spark at the plugs, and it will start with starting fluid
&gt;and run for a few seconds (until the fluid burns off), but it never seems
&gt;to be getting any fuel.
&gt;This wouldseem (to me) to be a problem with the carb, but it was working
&gt;fine before the engine rebuild. There is fuel getting to the carb ...
&gt; Any ideas anyone?
