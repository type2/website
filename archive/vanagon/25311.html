Ok, who else remembers this 'song'?? I think there is more, but I can't
remember it :)


	The Horse-Hair Latitudes

	When the T-2 conspires in bondo
	And its sullen and aborted seat stuffings
	breed tiny monsters
	True bodywork is dead!
	Awkward instant
	As the rusty floor-pan is pierced
	The wire-welder furiously pumping
	Its smooth silver gallop
	Ground and buttered with brushable seam sealer
	Sanding the new skim coat
	In mute, creme hardener, agony

	
	Jim Bentley, The (Sliding) Doors
