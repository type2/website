Subject: Wasserboxer Jug Reinstall

I'm fighting through the head gasket problem on a '91 with VW and the car.
Got to the last step and couldn't get the right jugs off the heads. I now
have the jugs and heads on the bench.

After some considerable pounding with a rubber hammer and prying with
chisels, the jugs came off the heads.

Problem is now how to get the jugs back on the pistons. Has anyone done
this and is there a trick/tool/technique that will work?

Herb
