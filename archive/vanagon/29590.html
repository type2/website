Subject: More Sharan

Bits culled from the last several issues of C&amp;D, Automobile etc.:

Sharan is not intended for U.S., VW says it would cost at least $30,000
here and therefore would not compete with domestic products. It was jointly
developed by VW and Ford (and sold by both) using 6 cyl. engine. I think
that it's built in Spain. the chassis is related to Passat, Ford did the
interior bits I believe.

It's aimed at the Espace (Renault) and is  expected to do well against the
Espace as it's a more recent design and lacks the traditional Renault
quality (or lack thereof). European press reports are quite favorable,
although it doesn't sound like it would go against the new Chrysler very
well, even at similar prices. You'll find a nice picture at the VW
(Germany) web site.

Moe
