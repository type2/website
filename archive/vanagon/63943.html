Subject: Anyone need some Audi brake parts?
Date: Mon, 18 Aug 1997 03:15:31 GMT

Hello, sorry to post this to the Vanagon and Type2 lists, but it's
kind of VW related. I bought some Audi brake parts from a 'list
vendor' who posts to these lists frequently. Unfortunately I ordered
for the wrong year. I was going to try to exchange the part and we
exchanged a few emails, but now I get no answers to my email. Since
the mistake was mine, they probably don't want to be bothered.

Anyway, I have two front rotors, two rear cylinders, and the rear
lining set for a 1985 Audi 4000. (I should have bought for a 1981)

If you could use these parts, please give me an email.

Later. . . .. . . .Brad
