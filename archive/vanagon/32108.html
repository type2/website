&gt;My '79 may have a similar problem if not as bad -- I fill it up to
&gt;overflowing and it only registers about 3/4 full.  It also seems to get down
&gt;to &quot;R&quot; too fast -- maybe it's a false reading.  My mech suggested that
&gt;instead of taking out the whole engine to replace the sensor (if you decide
&gt;to do that), you can cut a hole thru the metal directly above where the
&gt;sensor is located (going from a guidebook I guess?), making a little metal
&gt;flap that you can lift and shut again.  When you cover it with a mat you
&gt;won't notice the flap at all.  If you've recently bought the bus, check back
&gt;there and see -- maybe the p.o. already did this (as on mine.)
&gt;
I have some excellent info now on doing this, first I will try a replacement
fuel gauge tho', that being the cheapest, least work-intesive way to go (did
I say I was lazy??)  Oh, yeah, I have bought the bus, a year ago now... No,
there's no hole there from the PO (oh, that there were... life would be that
much simpler).
