Subject: help: uneven tyre wear '72 westfalia

how is that subject for accuracy?  ;)

my front tyres wear on the inside edge a lot (and the outside edge as 
well more than the center), and also scallop, but they are aligned with 
.125&quot; toe in like st. muir says.  of course my steering box is worn 
badly but i cant afford a new one yet.  i checked as well as i could on 
the condition of the suspension; nothing is badly worn, and the bearings 
are adjusted correctly.  everything is greased and the wheels do not 
rock at all when jacked up and pulled on.  camber seems to be okay 
(maybe just a _little_ neg camber), but the front end seems a bit high. 
 that may be due to my sagging rear end, though.

advice will be appreciated.

ps--im just about to leave for a road trip out west from georgia.  no, i 
dont expect to fix this before i leave; it has not worn out the tyres or 
caused any problems for 2 years, so i am not worried.  i am only curious 
and would like to call upon the gurus of the net for advice.
