Subject: Re: Appropriateness NON-VW

&gt;Humble comment on-
&gt;&gt;I cannot purchase the vehicle
&gt;I love and desire because some dork-in-a-tie decided that my vehicle of
&gt;choice is too dirty/unsafe for me to own.
&gt;               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;I think that beyond the restrictions of government there exists a higher set
&gt;of rules. The Earth is not at our disposal. Within a closed system no action
&gt;is ever done without consequence. Minimal impact on the system as we pass
&gt;through it is more important than getting upset at a government regulation
&gt;that, however poorly executed, is merely trying to enforce what you should
&gt;already be doing.

        Which brings up an interesting question. Exactly how much is my DP
1600 actually polluting? I've been of the understanding that the older VW
engines are actually relatively clean, but I am by no means sure of the
sources. I do think that running a itty bitty engine like this must be
better than a big block, but again I speak mostly from ignorance here.
Anybody care to enlighten me/us?

Peace,
