Subject: Re: J.C. Whitney-tel., address?

Fox Hunter Pat asked...
&gt;&gt;Oh knowledgeable Volks...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Does J. C. Whitless have an 800 telephone number or an e-Mail address?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I can't find my catalog- how can I exist without one?

The latest VW catalog lists no 800 numbers, but they do have numbers for 
voice or FAX.

(312)431-6102 Orders  
(312)431-5625 FAX 
	Open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

(312)431-6111 Customer Service
(312)431-6129 Parts and Parts Application 
	8am-8pm    Monday, Thursday
	8am-6pm    Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday
	8am-4:30pm Sunday

	All times Central

They are also listed in the Shopping2000 Web Page at

	http://shopping2000_dot_com/

You can find your way to their page, but the URL gets too weird to reprint.
They list an 800 number there.  It's (800)575-1888, mention code A316.  This
number for ordering catalogs.

Richard
