I seem to recall that high HC and low CO can be indicative of a rough-idle
miss.  If that is the case, you will want to make sure your wires and
plugs are good, and if yours uses points then make sure you have a new set
in there for the retest. 

Here are some of the tricks used to pass emissions in California:

change oil
refuel with oxygenated gasoline
partially block radiator with cardboard
set idle speed high but within mfrs. specs.
set timing retarded
get it real warm before the test

The oxygenated gasoline is sold here in the winter months.  I'm not sure 
if any other states have it.
