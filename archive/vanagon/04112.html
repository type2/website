Please someone post instructions on how to recieve the VANAGON maillist as
a digest and not each message individually.  This is driving me nuts!

ObVW: My '76 Camper (2.0 FI) passed NC inspection this week with flying
colors.  Best line by mechanic/inspector: &quot;Hell, you could LIVE in this
thing&quot;.  Planning to drive it to the NC coast (3 hour drive) next weekend.
