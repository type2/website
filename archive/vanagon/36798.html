Howdy.

I just tapped out my spare case for an oil filter (thanks to &quot;the 
Sermons of Bob Hoover&quot; for helping me figure out the best location), 
but now I'm kind of worried about having metal flakes from the 
machine work I did blocking oil passages.  I blew what I could out 
with compressed air (from downstream out the tapped hole), but I'd 
like to be sure that I got everything.  Any suggestions???  

Thanks!
