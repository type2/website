&gt;&gt;&gt;2)  clutch cylinder kit

&gt;&gt;&gt;Can anybody help?

&gt;&gt;Don't give aid to missionaries.  They destroy indigenous cultures.

&gt;This is a VW list, are we to start finding out what a person belives in
&gt;before we help with the vw? 
&gt;I thought this list was for all denominations; aircooled, waterboxers and
&gt;those new funny looking mini-van sort of vw's!
&gt;Gimme a break!

I remind you that I was not the one who brought this up.  Have you read the
book &quot;The Missionaries: God against the Indians&quot; by Norman Lewis?  Let me
quote the blurb:  &quot;This book will make you angry.  It is about genocide,
practiced today, against helpless people in the name of god.  These
destroyers are called Christians...&quot;
