Subject: vw sightings

          yes, i'm very behind on my mail due to great time at bike
          week but here's an idea from david schwarze's posting of
          early march re: &quot;ruthless people&quot; sighting where they wreck
          a split window -  maybe we could get enough people together
          like the animal rights folks and demand a disclaimer at the
          end of the flick &quot;no vintage vehicles were destroyed or
          injured during the making of this movie&quot;!  whattya think??
