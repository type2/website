Subject: EV problem tracking database

Hey, I think it's a good idea.  As the person facing the so far unknown
costs of fixing a coolant leak to the rear heater, knowing if someone
else has had the problem would help when crawling to VWoA, or when
fixing themselves.  Luckily another lister has had the same problem 
(lucky for me - kind of, I guess) and it helps just knowing the details 
of his very costly experience.

If there was a database that folks contributed to, it would be easier
to research problems.  Thanks Trace...
