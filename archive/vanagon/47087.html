while your messing with the level sensor be advised:
My wifes' 85 GL level sensor started leaking (of course it was eight
hours from home ,on a sunday, in BF Egypt).I figured it was the seal so
I unscrewed it, added some Super Blue,and screwed it back in.Well it
wasn't the seal that was leaking but a crack in the body of the
sensor.When I tightened it down the hex head part sheared away from the
rest of the body, leaving a one inch hole ! I was able to repair it with
some epoxy.When I got back home the dealer (surprisingly) only wanted a
few bucks for a new one .I bought two and went ahead and replaced the
one on my truck.Cheap insurance!!!
