O.K. others are fessing up, I will too.

My name is Bart Wineland from Meadville, PA.  100 miles N. of  
Pittsburgh and 35 miles S. of Erie.  I will admit I am of the  
&quot;wannabus&quot; variety.  I went thru the bug thing pretty big 10-15 years  
ago and had several and always wanted a bus.  Seeing how I am having  
a little bit of trouble convincing my wife I need one I am watching  
for one priced at &quot;entry level&quot;.  The trick is from the north here  
rust is a problem.  Joel Walker sent me several handy suggestions  
that I appreciate.  I remember heater boxes being a costly problem on  
Beetles, I suspect the same is true with buses??  If I were to luck  
into a Westy, has anyone ever added a passenger seat to safely haul  
kids with that you could pull in and out?
Anyone have first hand knowledge of the engine overhaul kits  
available form J.C. Witney?
Other things to really watch out for on a old rusty bus?
I can do ugly body work myself, how are the repair panels from  
Witney.
thanks,

Bart
