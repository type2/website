Subject: 80 4-spd transmission

Bentley calls this an 091 transmission.
Oil capacity is 3.5 ltr or 3.7 US qt.
the filler plug is on the right front, near the top. torque spec for it is
14 ft lbs.

 On most Vanagons that I've seen though that rubber boot where the shift
rod connects to the tranny is either off or split open. No one seems to
worry about it much.
