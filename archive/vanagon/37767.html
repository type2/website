Subject: 1986 westy syncro 

What is a realistic price to ask for it? I bought it new have most 
of the repair records. It has 98,000mi. and just replaced the 
heads, muffler and wheel bearing. Some rust in seams, noisy console 
and small dent in nose from loose 2x4 - bra covers it. Has air, 
stereo etc.  Not camping anymore.
