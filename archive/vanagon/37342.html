Subject: Re: Flame: proposed posting title formats


&gt;&gt; Other standard messages could include:
&gt;&gt; 'problem diagnosis, help: &lt;whatever your problem is&gt;'
&gt;&gt; 'discussion:  &lt;blah, blah, blah&gt;'
&gt;&gt; etc., etc., etc.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; if this is a waste of time, just flame me.....
&gt;
&gt;How to get the listmembers to adopt this plan (this thread seems to
&gt;rear its ugly head every 4-6 months) is the question.
&gt;
&gt;Based on past performance, I doubt it will happen.  Understand I'm
&gt;not berating the idea.


I don't think there are enough rules &amp; restrictions on my life.
I want MORE MORE MORE!!!   ;-)
