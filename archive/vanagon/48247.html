Subject:  88 gas filling ?

drove my brother to chicago midway airport in his 88 this weekend (~450
mile round trip).  on filling with fuel, i left the nozzle going while i washed
the windshield.  it filled, and spurted quite a bit of gas out when done.  i
asked my bro, he sez it doesn't do this in california, only on the old style
pumps.  what's the deal?  my 81 doesn't do this.

ps - saw no other buses on the way there, but 1 eurovan (wave, limbo
sticker), 2 later westies (1 wave), 1 bay (didn't see me) on the way
back.
