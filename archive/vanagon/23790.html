Thought you-all might enjoy this one:

&gt; 
&gt; Recently posted on dc.forsale:
&gt; 
&gt; FEDERATION INTERGALACTIC STARSHIP cloaked to resemble a 1973
&gt; Volkswagen beetle.  Over 110,000 parsecs of experience behind her, all
&gt; her functions are normal, including a quiet-running dilithium crystal.
&gt; Her commission in the State of Maryland has expired, however, and
&gt; State Highway Klingons who penetrate her shields may zap her with
&gt; photon torpedos unless she is taken to pass her MD safety inspection.
&gt; Her AM/FM communicator functions as well as Capt. Kirk's (it never
&gt; works and appparently never did).  Go where no man has gone before - a
&gt; few women, for that matter.  650 credits.  She is docked near Conn Ave
&gt; and the Beltway.  Call 202/ xxx-xxxx days for a tour of duty at her
&gt; bridge.  Oh, yes: nice paint job, new tires, and a teensy little hole
&gt; in the otherwise fine muffler.
&gt;         =       =       =       =       =       =       =
