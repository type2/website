Fine book there Joel.  I have given many copies away as I found them on the
$1 remainder table at a local book dump.  

The gesloshenmotor will do a fine job of long slow cooking if the intended 
feast is packaged suitably and RETAINED in position by safety wire.  

Imagine having to tell your insurance company that the car was wrecked because
your knockwurst held the throttle open at an inopportune time.

One of the best and easiest is to buy a couple of Idahos finest, nuke em for
five minutes at an en route convenience store and stash em in the upper engine
compartment after rubbing with olive oil and Kosher Salt and wrapping in brown
paper bags.  They stay toasty warm and ready to munch.  BTW rub the POTATOES 
with the oil and salt, not the driver/passenger.  

Wiring a chicken wire cage above the muffler will give a quicker cooking
recipe a fine boost but you must isolate the cooking foil pan from direct 
contact as the cat is awfully hot.

The usual wurst and kraut works well in the upper engine compartment (see
caveats above).  I have done a pot roast on the way to Great Basin Park and
it worked dandy.  Double wrap in HDAF to waterproof and put in an aluminum
baking thingy and wire it securely.

Now busgirl has the ultimate 12v crockpot cooking device that is much more
sophisticated and easier to use.  

On our yearly White Rim Trail adventure in Canyonlands NP, the 460CID Ford
motor in FordZilla (Chateau Quadravan 1.5ton) is used to cook all sorts of
interesting stuff en route.  

The operative words in manifold cooking are LEAK PROOF and SECURELY RETAINED.

Aaron the beastmaster (fordzilla's master) does lemon oregano chicken ala 
greque on a regular basis and it's scrumptious.     

Reheating Pizza is easy too.  The main trick is profiling you engine 
compartment thermally with a thermometer so you know what the steady state
temperatures are so you don't over or undercook.
