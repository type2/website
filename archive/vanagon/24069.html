Well, I'm glad to see that all the wife beating, drive by shootings,
drug dealing/using, child molestation, S&amp;L scandals and all that has 
finally come to an end.

&quot;What?&quot; You say?  Whaddaya mean?

Well, it must have all gone away, if the cops can take 25 minutes out of 
their day to try and figure out why I have Historial Vehicle plates on my
bus, and is it OK to have them on a Volkswagen (???) 

Oh yeah, and your right taillight flickers a little.

Arggggghhhh!  So I get a fixit ticket for the light.  

Interesting note though; I got pulled over in front of thr VW/Porsche Dealer!

[:\ - I'll be back!

Thom
