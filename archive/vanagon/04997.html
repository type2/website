&gt; Davids email address (starfleet) made me think of Star Trek, which made me 
&gt; think of a &quot;shuttle craft&quot; and thats what a Eurovan looks like to me.

	Yes!  That's exactly what strikes me when I gaze at mine,
particularly from the back.  It's got that shuttlecraft shape with a
slight widening below the center of gravity.  (I even dug up all the names
used for shuttlecraft in the TV shows and movies; none of them stuck though
I really like Galileo.)
