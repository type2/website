Subject: 15&quot; or 16&quot; wheels on the Syncro?

I know this subject has been kicked around before, but I've never seen
these specific questions answered:

Has anyone on the list upgraded their Syncro to 15&quot; or 16&quot; wheels?

If so, what wheels were used and what are their specs (ie. width, offset)?

Also, does anyone know the any of the details regarding the optional 16&quot;
wheels available on German Syncros - such as specs, construction (steel or
alloy), whether they have matching hubcaps - etc? Will these wheels fit
within the stock wells used on US Syncros?

Finally, has anyone looked into purchasing a set of these wheels?

Thanks!

Paul
