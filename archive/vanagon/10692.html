Subject: RE: VW-88 VANAGON GL-SLIDING DOOR OPENS...


...or something like that. I can't remember the exact title of the 
post, but someone was talking about a friend's '88 GL Vanagon with a 
sliding door that opened of it's own accord...

	I had the same problems with my '88 Wolfsburg Vanagon, and it 
had NOTHING to do with the electric lock system. Remember, the 
electric locks don't *open* the door themselves- they just lock or 
unlock the problem.

	The problem in my van seemed to come and go, but it was always 
similar- I'd hit a bump, or make a turn, or whatever, and the sliding 
door would come unlatched. Quite un-nerving indeed, especially to the 
folks in the back.

	THE SOLUTION: The solution to this pesky and dangerous problem 
lay in adjusting the striker post fixed to the rear edge of the 
sliding door opening. A friend helped me figure out that the latch at 
the rear of the door wasn't always closing fully over this striker 
post. It turns out that the striker post is adjustable- loosen the jam 
nut thingie on it, and you can slide it up 'n down, as well as in or 
out. I slid mine about 3mm out- toward the outside of the van- without 
changing the up-and-down positioning. Voila! The door has stayed shut 
when it's supposed to ever since!

	Have your friend check this out...

	Happy Motoring!
