Mike Wright complains:

&gt;The alternator &amp; EGR lights come on seemingly at will, sometimes for just a
&gt;flash, sometimes for a minute or more, and then they'll go out and stay out
&gt;for a couple of days.  This happens at highway speeds, low speeds, and in

I suspect a slight short in the wiring to the dashboard. *If* your EGR
light is anything like mine ('75 bus), then it should be controlled by a
little box alongside the speedometer cable. This box counts the miles and
switches the EGR light on every 15,000 miles. All this stuff is in front
and has little to do with the engine, which is in the back. Happy hunting!
