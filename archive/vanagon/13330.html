Subject:       West Marine catalog review!

First off, thanks to Martha for the lead on West Marine, it's a 
goody. 

 I just received my catalog yesterday and it is FULL of 
goodies for the consumate tinker-er.  things like tinned copper 
primary wire (doesn't corrode), 2/0 cable lugs (again tinned copper), 
illuminated rocker switches that just might fit the VW dash, fuse 
panels with banks of switches (Joel- here you go... even have cool 
names on them like anchor light, bilge pump etc), all sorts of 
stainless steel and brass/bronze fittings screws bolts, power 
inverters, camping stuff (like 12v solar showers and blenders!), 
gimbal mounted kerosine lamps, all sorts of pumps, fans, galley 
faucets and more.  oh yeah, they even sell stuff for boats.

864 pages of nice quality, corrosion resistant stuff.  prices are 
high on some items ($6.95 for a Fram PH2870A) but they got stuff i 
just haven't been able to find.  i'm in heaven.
