Subject: location of vacuum hose????
Date: Sun, 15 May 1994 21:57:27 -0500 (EST)

Hello!

This will be my last question before I leave on the 15K mile roadtrip.
On the road, I'll be on my own.  No net access.  :-(  I'll have to rely on Muir
and Bently.

I accidently dissconnected the vacuum hose from my EGR valve on my 76 van.
I looked, but I couldn't find where the other end goes!  Somewher near the
intake air manifold/distributor, I think.  Regardless, my EGR has been
disconnected from the exhaust for years, it's just that I am losing vacuum.
I can even hear the air his when I run the engine.

Thanks for you help, everybody.
