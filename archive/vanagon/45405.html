Subject: Need a hand from a vancouverite

        I just called Basco Auto Parts here in Edmonton for a price on the
pop top seal for my 83, since they can order stuff through California
Import Parts. Now I had heard that C.I.P. was cheap for these items but it
turns out that they charge (from what Basco tells me) $175 for the main
seal, and $100 for the luggage rack seal.
        So....if any of you kind folk in Van could give CIP a call and
verify if this was the price I would be very thankful. The 1 800 # that I
had been given was &quot;not in service&quot; according to the kindly operator lady.

        I have an itching feeling that I'll end up ordering these from Bus
Boys as they are much cheaper, but oerdering from Canada would be nice.

cheers,
Mike
83' Vanagon
