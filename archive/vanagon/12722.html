&lt;

Well, down here in Texas (Houston), we don't need the heat 
toooooooooo much, but
Has anyone ever mounted one of those inline boosters under 
the drivers seat in a van ?
You know the ones I mean ..... as advertised in J.C. 
Whitney and the most recent issue of Cool VW's.

This is not a heater, but just an air assist &quot;suck&quot; or 
blower, if you will for just that little extra air flow.

By the way, I need to go under my '69 camper and take a 
hard look at the heater tube.
Am i gonna die from asbestos inhalation ?
