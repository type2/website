OK OK OK

I had my heads done on my blue whale and now the idling is low.  Pickup   
is also real crappy.  The idling used to hang around 1500-1750 and now   
its at 500-750.  When I step on the gas, it seems to take its time   
accelerating but once it starts it picks up fairly quickly.

What do I start looking for?
