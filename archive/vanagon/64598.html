&lt;&lt; Well, while I was in California last week,
 I saw a bubble window bus with Alaska licence plates
 with a sliding door on both sides.

 I was simply blown away.

 It had no rust at all.

 How rare are these vans???? &gt;&gt;


pretty rare...
i presume it was a panel, too, huh?
there was a '70 doubledoor panel in a Texas boneyard posted to the list about
a month ago....anybody get it??
