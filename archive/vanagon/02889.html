Subject: rebuilt engine suppliers

Impending valve failure [$$$$] - that's the bad news.

Now I have to decide whether to just have a valve job or bite the bullet and
swap for a rebuilt engine.

I am leaning towards the rebuilt engine [$$ouch$$].  Given the frustration I've
had with my local mechanic, I want to choose the supplier.

The only supplier that leaps to mind is Gex - are they ok?  Any other suppliers
out there with good rebuilt engines at a fair price?

BTW, I am in Ann Arbor, Michigan if anyone local to me comes to mind. ;-)
