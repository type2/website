Jared-
 I recently posed a similar question although my 2 liter wasn't getting 
quite that hot (peaking under load at 230). The recommendation for an 
additional cooler is the plate style (as opposed to tube and fin) - 
although I would certainly try and find out why your temps are getting 
that high. Outside air temp seem to me to make a significant difference 
in how cool my van runs. One thing I have just done is reconnect the egr 
system (based on Dennis Haynes post re:peak flame temp) and although 
outside air temps have dropped significantly in the past day or so (now 
around 60) this seems to have effected a serious drop in oil temp. - 
pulling up a 7 mile steep grade yesterday it peaked at just over 180. 
(I'm awaiting hotter weather now to check again) - 
 Of course another area to check is to make sure your engine compartment 
is sealed well, including around oil pressure sender, oil fill tube, 
heater air tubes, etc. etc. -
