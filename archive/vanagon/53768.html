Donald,
To minimize the time period when the oil pressure is too low, I find
that I can pour oil into the filter before screwing it on. 
 
Next time you drain the oil, stick your little finger in and feel
around. I once found a washer in my old Saab that must have been in
there since new.

If you haven't yet thrown out the old filter, see if it is intack and
hasn't lost any packing. Such packing can play hell with the oil
journals.

The fact that your oil pressure is fine now suggests that any blockage
(if any) has moved on to the filter or sump.

P.S. I have attached a small but strong magnet to my drain plug to
capture any metal wear.

&gt; Some odd things happened when I did my regular oil service on my '85
&gt; Vanagon today.  When I pulled the oil filter after draining the oil,
&gt; a lot of oil came out with the filter--more than I think is normal.
&gt; It was as if the oil passage close to the filter flange was 'holding'
&gt; oil or something.  When I installed the filter and added 4 quarts of
&gt; synthetic and started the engine it took at least a minute for the
&gt; oil light to go out.  I turned the engine off and on a few times for
&gt; fear that the engine would be starved of lubrication.  I'm used to a bit of a delay after an oil
&gt; change, but this seemed excessive.  The engine is almost new, a
&gt; remanufactured unit from VW of Canada installed around 15,000 miles ago last
&gt; January, and has been flawless.
&gt; 
&gt; Once the engine finally developed sufficient oil pressure, now on
&gt; restarting, the oil light goes out immediately.
&gt; 
&gt; I checked the oil and found that it was almost a quart low after
&gt; adding the initial four quarts--I usually add the additional 1/2
&gt; quart after starting the engine, checking for leaks and then checking
&gt; oil level.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this odd, or am I being hypersensitive.
