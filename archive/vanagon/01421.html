I don't think your problem is &quot;high in the front&quot; as much as low in the 
back.  Remember the engine sits on those torsion bars 24 hours a day.  
The solution is to adjust the swing arms on the torsion bars.  All the 
stories I have heard tell me it is a heck of a job, though, and you risk a 
broken torsion bar.  I just let mine get a little lower every year, and 
park on a hill to check the oil.  It's a good way to tell the age too. 
the older the bus the lower in back:-)=
