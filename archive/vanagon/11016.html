&gt;    Well, rust, and a motor that runs!
&gt; 
&gt; Given my choice, a '78 to '83 Westy retrieved from somewhere warm and dry 
&gt; would be ideal. The '78 I had ran obediently, was cheap to fix, but was 
&gt; Canadian thus rusty. If you have cash and can move quickly this list could 
&gt; help you out lots, just read the for sale ads that kind souls post to make 
&gt; us Canajuns drool on our keyboards. 

I agree (so much for the junk post).  Rust has always been my first
priority.  On a scale of 1-10, engines are a 4 at best (aircooled engines 
are cheap).  My advice is to get a subscription to a south California
newspaper ({flame suit on} the LA news papaer will provide something
resembling real news as a bonus {flame suit off}), and look for: 

A pre-67 for lowest loss of value over time. If you buy it in good 
condition and take good care of it, you have an investment that will 
increase in value over the years. (Joel, sent this guy the quiz about ice 
in your shorts, though)

A 71 as a good compromise between parts availability (last bug engine) and 
best handling (for the age).

A 78-80 (breadloaf) for good reliability, low price and decent parts 
availability (no heat, but with a gas heater, .....)

An 81-83 (aircooled vanagon) great body, great engine, still no heat.

An 84-90 (wasserboxer) same body, more HP, more $$, (do you live on a 4:1 
hill?), first real heat.

A 91-94 great body, great heat, an active warranty!, $$$$$$$......

The only real answer to the question &quot;Which VW is the right one for me?&quot;  
is that the right VW for you is the one you fall in love with.  All VW's 
need TLC.  They will reward your love with reliability, but punish 
inattention.  Every year has plusses and minuses.  As you go back in 
time, the older busses will require more care, but you get a more 
&quot;collectible&quot; bus and there is an indefinable &quot;romance&quot; to them that I 
find irresistible.  The wasserboxers have real heat and great space, and 
the Eurovans are new, and fine looking, not to mention under warranty (no 
arguing with dealers).  

My last word is the the eternal &quot;YMMV&quot;.  Take a vacation in SoCal for a
week, attend a VW event, look around, fall in love with one, buy it, drive
it home.  If you don't fall in love, don't buy.
