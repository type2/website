&gt;Could the broken ground strap have been a contributing factor to the

NuBus ('82 Diesel) would not start (when I turned the key, all the
dash lights started blinking, and the dome lights went out.)

I finally gave up and sent it up to my mech. He said it was a weak 
battery, and told me to pick it up. He said he had been starting it all 
day with no trouble.  When I got there to start it, bingo, no joy. I 
proved I wasn't a  _complete_ raving lunatic.

So, I once again looked at the ground strap between the battery and 
engine. It was fine. After we spent a 1/2 hour of debug time with the 
Fluke meter, Dave Fretz (my mech) remembered the _other_ ground strap, 
between the engine and the body. Five minutes later, I was off and 
running.
