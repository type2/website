Subject: 85 Vanagon GL FS N. California

It's time to part with my trusty 85.  I have been it's only owner for 12 years.  Now I have to get a 4 wheeler 
for my wife to get to work in the winter time.  Anyway, what I have is an 85 GL with 169K with the  weekender seat. No AC.  
It's in very nice condition as I have carefully maintained her through the years.  Last November, I did a top end 
rebuild complete with rebuilt RIMCO heads, new rings, complete gaskets and seals, clutch disc, throwout bearing, 
phosphate free coolant and some other stuff.  I also did a recent dis-assembly of the CV's with new grease and 
some new boots.  Also replaced front pads, changed brake fluid, master cyl, and other routine maintenance items.  
She has good rubber all around.  Three UniRoyal Laredo light truck tires and one original Conti light truck tire.

Runs great; absolutely no leaks of any kind.

$4100
