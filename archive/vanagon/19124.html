Subject: Re: fix the plug!!!

     &gt;My wife and I will be going to Maine (and back) in our 71 camper on
     &gt;June 22.  It is 800 miles one way, and I was wondering what I should 
     &gt;bring, and what I should check.  The only thing which is bugging me 
     &gt;about the bus is the frozen #4 plug.  It has been in there for who 
     &gt;knows how long, and I plan to run it until the plug fails.  Does 
     &gt;anyone have an idea of how long a plug will last in a 1600?  I've put 
     &gt;almost 2k on it since I installed it in late April, and have had few 
     &gt;problems.
     
     Chris,
     
     I has the same problem with #3, I left it and it dropped a valve.
     
     The piston came though the side of the barrel wall.
     
     Part of the piston came off and got trapped between one of the 
     crankshaft counterweights and the crankcase...
     
     ...the crankcase got punched out as a result
     
     so the engine wasn't even any use as a core on a rebuilt one.
     
     stupid me, it would have taken less than a couple of days to 
     wip the heads off and do it properly.
     
     Lee.
