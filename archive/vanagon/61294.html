Subject: Dometic Doings II - A question

     All-
     
     I think I found out why the 3-wire plug to the fridge was 
     disconnected.  Hopping into the van to go home from work, I (finally) 
     hear the fridge fan running.  Now, mind you, the fridge is not on; not 
     on gas, and not on 12V.  It's pretty hot in the car from the sun 
     beating down and all, so I guess that's what tripped the thermo 
     switch.
     
     Seems that something should be cutting the power to this whole thing 
     when the fridge is off - check the '90-'91 wiring diagrams, but it 
     doesn't jump out at me.
     
     Any ideas?
     
     TIA

     BTW, installed the &quot;Wolfsburg&quot; right side rear-facing jump seat from 
     Sorin last night - really cool!  You shoulda seen the look on the UPS 
     guy's face when he was unloading the television box Sorin packed it in 
     - the box was the worse for wear, and the UPS guy was obviously 
     contemplating a lot of paperwork when I saw that my &quot;TV&quot; was beat up 
     and broken!
