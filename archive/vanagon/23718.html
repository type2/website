Hi Mario.

Try L&amp;T enterprizes in Allentown.  Both J. Grazul and I of this list
seem to have had good luck with them.

L&amp;T Enterprizes:
610 - 264 - 9191


you might also try:
610 682 2186 (Ken Miller)
in eastern PA.  I never tried these people, so I do not know much
about them.	


good luck to you!!!

 &gt; Hi,
 &gt; I am still looking for a cylinder head for a 1980 Westy
 &gt; (air cooled, 2.0 litters, square ports). The head currently
 &gt; on the engine is unserviceable due to a dropped valve seat.
 &gt; 
 &gt; I would appreciate any leads on where to get new/rebuilt heads.
 &gt; Also, does anyone have any experience with the new heads made in
 &gt; Spain (the seem to be cheaper than rebuilts !!)
 &gt; 
 &gt; Thanks a bunch
