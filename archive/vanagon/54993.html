Subject: Eurovan UPDATE

To Ric, et al:

I just recently got my third copy of the publication and I'm comfortably
happy with the endeavor.

I managed to get the portion of the undercover removed (based on a
template provided in UPDATE); that effort now allows me a, klutz with
tools, to get to the oil filter with ease. The people who normally
change my oil like the modification, also!

I'm looking (thinking about) getting fog lights based on the information
I read.

The general gist information in UPDATE helps me to settle in, knowing
that once VWoA got the money, I was effectively left out to dry (after a
soaking) with respect to longevity and upkeep for the EV.

I'm seeing more urst and the vinluy is peeling. I wasn't sure about what
I was or was not doing. Information in UPDATE confirms that more than my
EV have this common problem.

Realizing that I travel for great distances, in spurts, made me think I
was putiing many, many more miles on my EV than the average. Now,
reading about others, I'm assured that I'm well &quot;within&quot; the pack! ;)

UPDATE just gives we a better feeling that there's some (body or thing)
out there that considers and cares for the EV, even if it is JUST US_at_!_at_

regards.
