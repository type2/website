Subject: Re:CCC &amp; Techron

Hi ya'll! I'm a '72 Bus &amp; '73 914 owner who's been lurking a week or so. 
Living in San Luis, the ccc sounds like a go! I've got a newly installed 
camper interior to try out....On techron,a friend who's a Chevy wrench 
got sent to a fool injection school. The official bowtie word was to run 
Techron thru before trying *any* diagnostics. Keeps the 914 running well, 
too! Bill D
