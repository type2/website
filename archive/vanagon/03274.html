&gt;Ohhhhhh... I'd just LOVE to have a 20 year old Transit.
&gt;
&gt;When I was young, I had to get up half an hour before sunrise,
&gt;lick the cesspool clean with me tongue...nail a set of wooden
&gt;wheels to my feet and skate four hours up hill to work....
&gt;
&gt;Then nail the wheels to my head, because my feet were broken
&gt;up, coast down hill to home, which was a torn up paper
&gt;bag, and my dad would beat me about the head and body
&gt;with a 2x4 while singing &quot;Kliener GTI&quot;...

You were LUCKY.  A cesspool would've been pure LUXURY for us!
