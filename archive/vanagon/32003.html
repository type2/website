Subject: Vanagon seating arrangements (was: Carat Question)


&gt;     Two rear facing seats backed up behind the driver and shotgun
&gt;     seats. The usual three person bench in back. If I'm not
&gt;     mistaken there was a table set up between the two rows of
&gt;     rear seats. Seems great for a family with kids, they can all
&gt;     color or whatever on the table in backlike our son does in
&gt;     the Westie, but it still seats seven.


When I got the V6anagon, the center seat was in the PO's barn. We threw
it in, where it rested against the back seat till I installed it correctly
here in Sandy Eggo.

Looking at the seat rails under it, it looks like it could be installed
backward as easily as forward-- cool! Not quite as classy as your two
separate rear-facing seats, but still nice. And with a table between them
as you described... card games en route!

If it can be done to mine, it should be doable for all vanagons, unless
VW changed the interior in some later year.

Thanks for the idea!
