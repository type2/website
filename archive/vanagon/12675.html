one oversight, you neglected to mention what type of bus the split is you
found (year, model etc.)

&gt;     Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;     A few months ago I told of a Split bus that me and my mate (Danny
&gt;     11-window Devon camper) had found rusting away in an old farmyard
&gt;     nearby. We spoke to the owner and she said we could have it for 100
&gt;     quid.
&gt;
&gt;     So we finally got our butts in gear and this is where we're at:
&gt;
&gt;     Last week I sorted out a lock-up garage a few miles from my house
&gt;     where we could put the bus - this will come in handy when I need to
&gt;     work on my bus and it's raining, ie always. We will use the garage to
&gt;     store the bus in whilst we break it - it's not worth saving.
&gt;
&gt;     Then I sorted out a trailer to tow it home on. My mate (Martin
&gt;     23-window 911 bus) knew a guy with a trailer, and he'd lend it for 15
&gt;     quid - bargain.
&gt;
&gt;     We've just got to sort out the deal with the owner and it'll be ours.
&gt;     Hopefull it'll get sorted this weekend, and I can attack it with my
&gt;     sockets and spanners - any UK'ers want any parts ?? (USA'ers welcome
&gt;     too)
&gt;
&gt;     How about this: I'm gonna cut the front panel off and hang it on the
&gt;     garage wall - cool.
&gt;
&gt;     cya,
&gt;
&gt;     Lee.
