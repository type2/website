Subject: New Skylight anyone? $45.00 + Shipping
Date: Fri, 9 May 97 09:30:25 -0500
From: Sam Moore &lt;samoore_at_shellx.best_dot_com&gt;

My skylight is all beat up and leaks.

I needed a new one and searched around all over the net.
My result is a new VW Skylight assembly. The best price I have found is 
$125.00 and up.

I don't need a whole assembly, just a replacement skylight.

Maybe I am nuts, but there must be some other folks who are in the same 
situation. 

That is well over my budget.  I found a plastic fabricator who will 
design a replacement skylight &quot;the acrylic part only&quot; in quantity 100 
units for $45.00 each.

Are there 99 others who need one?  It's a bit pricey, but much less than 
the unit.

It seems like creating a mold  and such is the bulk of the cost.

It will have a slightly different design:
 same footprint and dimensions
 stronger edges
 gray tint
 be made of PETG
 More shatter resistant than Acrylic
 non-yellowing more scratch resistant than polycarbonate

This is a call for interest NOT an order form!

If you are interested in a replacement /spare /whatever skylight at that 
price.
If I get &gt; 100 confirmations, we may be able to reduce the price some...?
please email me with the following if you are interested:
