I have just bought a 1991 VW Caravelle Syncrobus and was wondering if anyone 
has any experience of these incredible offroad vehicles. They where quite 
popular in South Africa but manufacture was stopped when VW upgraded from the 
2.1 fuel injected boxer engine to a 2.5 straight four in 1993.

Any info will be appreciated.
