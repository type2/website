&gt;No doubt Dave! $2,000. would scratch easily as for that price you'd still 
be
&gt;in the primer stage. Maybe $2,000 in materials alone without body and paint
&gt;labor.


For me, maybe not.

Hey, these are cars, not jewels. You know, open road, dust, rain,
well-fed birds flying overhead, parking in shopping center lots I
don't exclusively own?

After that much for materials, I'd have to spend $5K for labor, thus
tripling the value of my car. And then I'd be terrified of driving it,
for fear of getting the least ding or smudge. Thus I would wind up
reducing its value to ZERO!

To each his/her own. But I'd prefer that my car get a life, and act
like a car rather than a 1-1/4 ton conversation piece.
