Subject: Re: restoring interior chrome

&gt;&gt;I am sure you folks with the later VW buses don't have this problem, but
&gt;&gt;recently I've taken on the chore of restoring the interior chrome in my bus.
&gt;&gt;I've tried several methods and have had varying success, can anyone offer
&gt;&gt;the best solution? snipo
&gt;
&gt;didn't lee griffiths or someone 'on the other side of the pond' suggest
&gt;using rhubarb leaves??? rhubarb leaves are actaully fairly toxic (it is for
&gt;this reason that you don't compost them)
&gt;
&gt;michael

Now that's an interesting potion.  If I were to experiment with rhubarb
leaves, where does one get these?
