&gt;Well, I lost two of the bolts/screws out of it and several of them seem to
&gt;have damaged threads. I'll check the local hex-head bolt vendor and see
&gt;what I can come up with. Fortunatly, nothing LOOKS damaged...except,
&gt;perhaps my confidence in other repairs I've performed. ;0 (Guess this 
&gt;makes a good case for going back and double checking reparis from time to 
&gt;time.)

Make sure the bolts you by are grade 10.9 or better, 12.9 preferred. Use
torque wrench to get them to 32 ft/lbs.  These bolts should be replaced
whenever making repairs.  Get the boot kits with the hardware included. Makes
it easier.
