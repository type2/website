&gt;&gt; Hey all,
&gt;&gt; Last night watching &quot;Pop-Up Video&quot; on VH-1 they showed the Men at Work
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; video &quot;Down Under&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Right at the beginning of the video is one of the band members driving
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; an orange early bay, RHD, in the Australia desert.  There is an
&gt;&gt; interior
&gt;&gt; shot of him driving, then he stops, gets out, walks around front, and
&gt;&gt; opens the LH sliding door to let the other band members out.  Pretty
&gt;&gt; neat :-)
&gt;
&gt;Being a child of the 80s (whoop de do ;). I was a fan of Men at Work.
&gt;The first line of the song 'Down Under' is:
&gt;
&gt;Travelling in a fired out Kombi.
&gt;
&gt;It caught me by surprise the first time I read the lyrics :)
