Subject: Austin Vee Dee bad motor #3

Today i stripped the motor down, and pulled off the #1/#2 head which had
blowby.  It  turned out that none of the head bolts were tight.   I took off
#2 cylinder, to get a look at the rod, which was fine.   I put the cylinder
and head back on, and torqued the other head and the case bolts.    I took
the clutch off, which was lovely and new, but the flywheel nut was so tight i
broke my breaker bar i just got three days ago.      hmm, maybe i should get
one of those 3/4&quot; slider dealies.     In the interest of time, the end play
was ignored. 

Then I switched the broken throw out arm for a new one.  this was an
interesting puzzle.   it involved removing the clutch adjsuting wingnut,  a
couple circlips, a hidden (oregon dirt) 11mm bolt, and slight of hand.   The
first circlip took off the arm that the clutch cable winghut pulls against.
  a spring comes off with it, then a cover piece.   the second wingnut is on
the other side of a brass bushing that goes through the hole in the bell
housing.   taking this offand the washer behind it allowed me to pull the
thrown up arm partly out of the bell housing, revealing some rubber covers
that were behind the brass bushing.  these three came off.   Now it just
barely had enough room to slide out,   from the inside of the bell housing.
  Careful placing of pieces in order was neccessary in order to reassemble
it.         
if it had been a split case trans the case would have had to come apart to
replace it.  

dressed the happier motor,  reassembled the muffler using the correct clamps
(the tailpipe clamp is smaller than the heater box to muffler clamps, which
is what was used),  put on  fresh air hoses, popped it in.  i really dont
approve of that d*mn engine support bars in the 69 bus.  what a stupid
concept.   if the the support bar is on first, the muffler clamps are a pain,
and the other way round, getting the bar on is a pain.  (can  i have some
cheese with this whine?)  We took a test drive, and  I drained the oil when
we got back, in case some of that oregon logging road clay dust got in the
motor oil, which was dirty anyway.   now my friends are off to BC to hike the
forests, etc.  with a working clutch, and more power.    :)

the end...
