Subject: Silver Secret

More hints on the silver secret mystery:

I have an '82 Westy L, with the gas heater and green knob, and it ALSO has
the silver 12V connector.

My sister has an '80 Westy non-L, no gas heater, and she has the silver
secret, too.

I've looked at the wiring diagrams in the Haynes, Bentley and Clymer manuals,
and can't find a trace of it.


On another, older topic:  In the tire thread, someone had asked if
&quot;reinforced&quot; was the same as &quot;Load Range C&quot;.  If that got answered, I missed
it.  Izzat the same thing?

I tried for months to get Michelin replacements for the OEM 185R14 Load Range C
tires.  The local Michelin peddlers here in Beertown couldn't get them - said
they weren't in the midwest warehouses.  They showed up in TireAmerica's
computers, so I tried a special order.  They were perpetually due to arrive
&quot;next week&quot;.  I gave up and bought some Dunlop's.  Amazing!  They seem to
improve the handling - they certainly make less noise while cruising and in
hard cornering, and they look like they are wearing better than the Michelin's.
Did the British do something right?
