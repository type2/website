Subject: Re:  Sticky Throttle Cable

I used a can of &quot;lock-ease&quot;.  Jammed the little tube thru the grommet
behind the boot in the engine compartment where the cable comes in.
Pumped it in till it overflowed and the problem went away.  The
throttle is MUCH easier to push on now.

I had my cable *completely* freeze on a road trip up north over Christmas
and this did the trick (after it thawed).  Check the whole length of the
tube that the cable runs thru to ensure that the rubber
connectors are all intact.  One of mine had fallen off exposing the 
cable/tube to moisture causing the problem.  Some hose clamps or nylon
cables ties may be helpful.

 &gt;
 &gt;Does anyone know of a way to grease a throttle cable without removing it.?  My
 &gt;cable in my 1987 Syncro is beginning to bind and makes some weird noises when
 &gt;the accelerator pedal is depressed. The problem seems to be worse during colder
 &gt;days.
