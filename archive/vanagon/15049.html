Subject: Re: CV Repair

&gt;&gt;          Complete rebuilt and warranteed axles,( both CVs etc,) for my '87
&gt;&gt; Syncro are $141 CDN, (ie $100US) so you should do some checking. It is way
&gt;&gt; cheaper to buy a rebuilt axle than to buy a dealer priced single joint and
&gt;&gt; do all the labour and end up without a warranty. Same goes for my ex-Honda!
&gt;&gt;   tim s.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Where are you finding complete axles rebuilt for $100 US, the best I
&gt;could ever find was remanufactured joints for $45 each, were these
&gt;remanufactured with new OEM joints? if so share your source.

I've got a complete axle (axle, both CV's and (untorn) boots) from a '77
that I'm selling for $65 plus shipping.  Alls you need to do is clean 'em,
repack 'em and slap them in.  Don't know if it'll fit an '87 Synchro, but
certainly '68-'79.

Contact me if you are interested!
