Subject: URL Update for Hemmings Motor News - Links Welcome
Date: 16 Apr 1996 21:13:44 GMT

Hello again.  Just wanted to notify people in this group that, because of
our Internet Service Provider, we had to change the Hemmings url from

http://maple.sover_dot_net/~hemmings/hmn.html [OLD URL DON'T USE!]

to

http://www.sover_dot_net/~hemmings/hmn.html

Sorry for all of you wonderful folks who have been giving us links.

I'm still on the lookout for new links to collector-car subjects.  It's a
lot of work, but I want to make sure the Hemmings site has the BEST
collection of links.  I may fall behind a bit on checking and adding the
links, but I try to get to it every two or three weeks.
