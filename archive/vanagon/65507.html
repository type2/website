&gt;&gt;&gt;  I thought that people would like to know that a Westy can also be
&gt;insured
&gt;&gt;&gt;  as an RV (at least with State Farm).
&gt;
&gt;You got lucky. Everyone I called in Seattle said a VW Camper Van was
&gt;considered a standard vehicle and not an RV. I guess they see a lot of
&gt;camper vans up here.
&gt;

The EV Campers have a Washington State plate on them that classifies them
as an RV. State Farm insures them for about half the yearly rate as a
result.
(It also may be because I insure other vehicles with them so they know its
not a daily driver.)
As I recall, my Vanagon Camper was pretty cheap too.
