&gt;Subject:Love-Bug OFF dates CHANGED!!!!
&gt;
&gt;Due to a conflicting schedule and an overzealous park booking agent we have
&gt;decided to reschedule our &quot;event&quot; so as to not intrude on the serenity of the
&gt;other campers. Another &quot;group&quot; is booked for that weekend and as the ranger was
&gt;kind enough to explain &quot;They have a little influence -Upstairs-!&quot; which I took
&gt;to mean, well, form your own conclusions....;-)  No problems, no worries as I
&gt;doubt ANY of us were planning our summer vacation around it...
&gt;
&gt;BTW: We have flyers made up for the event (post me and I'll attach one to ya)
&gt;or send a snail address or fax number and we'll ship one out conventionally!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;(insert sound of trumpets.au here) THE SECOND ANNUAL LOVE_BUG OFF (flagwav.mov)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Yes VolkFolks, it is almost time for the next best thing since Garlic Pickles.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;SITE:  O-Leno State Park
&gt;        http://www_dot_dep.state.fl_dot_us:80/parks/northcentral/oleno.html
&gt;
&gt;WHEN:  September 28th and 29th (with people coming in as early as Fri.the 27th)
&gt;
&gt;WHY:   Hey, we're bus folk. Where else we gonna look comfortable pulling out
&gt;        all the tents and spice racks and cute little stuffed plushies?
&gt;
&gt;WHYNOT: ????
&gt;
&gt;STUFF: Low key, but basically we're gonna have a swap meet and meet meet on
&gt;        Saturday along with obligatory frisbee tossin and river swimmin and
&gt;        BBQ'ing or vegie grazin, basking in the sun (tho it's mostly woodsie)
&gt;        as well as nature walkin and fishin (bring yer permit).. Great for
&gt;        the youngins less interested in VWs than we are.
&gt;       Sunday we're renting,dragging,borrowing a bunch of canoes along with
&gt;        packing some great grub for a cool water spring picnic while we float
&gt;        down the beautiful Sante Fe River... `Bout a 6 hour float and at the
&gt;        end (Rum Island) we'll catch a ride back up to our waiting vehicles..
&gt;
&gt;CONTACT: Me  (Busbones_at_praxis_dot_net) Let me know who and how many (we're getting
&gt;        a reservation on their &quot;Group Site&quot; which will accomadate 140 of us
&gt;        with our vehicles.) That way we can spread stuff out and not bother any
&gt;        of the Un-Volkswagen folks. I need help organizing foodstuffs and misc
&gt;        stuff (any EastCoast Marthas?) as I don't put my salad forks in the
&gt;        proper place (ever!)
