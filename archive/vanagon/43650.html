Subject: Re: TDI Eurovan

I have a brochure from Germany here, specifically on the TDI engine in the
Transporter.  The specs are as follows:

5 Cylinder, with catalytic convertor
2.5 liter
102 HP _at_ 3500rpm
250Nm torque  (does anyone out there have the conversion?)
6.6 liter per 100km fuel consumption.

0-62mph 18.1 sec (Kombi), 19.3 (high-roof) 19.8 (pickup)  19.6 (double cab)

If there are any other specs you need, just let me know.

Ryan
