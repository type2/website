Subject: Re: mpg, was Retro-f. F.I.

Doesn't engine friction generally decrease (until the tail-end of the engine's 
life anyway) as time goes on? The mileage on our Jetta has gone up 1-2 mph 
gradually in the nearly 4 years that we've owned it.

&gt; &gt;This has been discussed thoroughly last fall. Here's my experience:
&gt; &gt;1980 Vanagon with Pop top, 2.0l F.I., Man. Trans., no extras
&gt; &gt; -&gt; 15-17 mpg on short trips
&gt; &gt; -&gt; up to 22 or 23 mpg on long highway runs (60-65 mph)
&gt; 
&gt; well, see, i'm getting a little worried about my bus. the mpg has been going
&gt; UP for the last 16,000 miles. to such an extent that the AVERAGE for 86,000
&gt; miles has risen 0.2 mpg. now, to me, that's a lot (for the long term average)
&gt; ... and it worries me. for years, it plodded along at 19.4 average. now it's
&gt; creeped up to 19.6 and gives every indication of going to 19.7 this summer.
&gt; 
&gt; yeah, i know: don't look a gift horse in the mouth. but this bothers me,
&gt; if it was going down, then i'd know something was wrong and i'd had some
&gt; ideas. but this! i don't think i'm driving that much slower. i don't think
&gt; i'm driving any less in town. the ONLY thing i can connect to this is that i
&gt; started using those Bosch triple-electrode plugs just about the time the mpg
&gt; started going up a little. ??? coincidence?? maybe the plugs just suit my
&gt; driving style better? maybe the old plugs were that much wrong??
&gt; maybe they've done something to the gasoline around here? maybe my bus is
&gt; really a Democrat?? ;)
&gt; 
&gt; arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhh!!!! old folks hate change!! :)
&gt; 
&gt; anyway, i'm getting up to 21-22 on the highway now. and 17-18 in town.
&gt; 
&gt; subject to change without notice.
