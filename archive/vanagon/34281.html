Subject: Camper accessories info wanted

I'm looking for any info (scematics, text, addresses, etc.) about outfitting
air-cooled buses.  I have a '74 poptop, and I want to add a stove to it.
 I've pretty much given up on adding the toilet, since I noticed the interior
configuration does not follow that of models that have the toilet.  I'm
taking it cross-country this summer, and I want it to be functional for the
trip.  Any leads would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks and,

Happy Camping!

Steve
