|Trevor E. envisions an electric aux oil pump.  I would picture this would
|have to be a fairly serious pump.  Engine oil pump looks like it uses
|a horsepower, maybe more.  Even tho' Trevor's pump would never be asked to
|move cold oil, to have an effect it would need to move good volume.

Don't forget that the engine oil pump has to move a large volume through the 
engine against the backpressure of the galleries and bearings. The separate 
pump only has to push hot thin oil through some half inch pipes and the 
cooler. For example 110V transfer pumps use motors about the size of heater 
blower motors. 1/8 HP or less

|Maybe you could make something effective out of the oil pump from an auto-
|matic transmission car, that has the second pump built right on.

How about a small pump with an electric clutch a la A/C compressor with belt 
drive

|  Note that
|Porsche six oil pump is two stages: one to scavenge the sump and put the
|oil in the (nine-quart) oil tank, the other to pressurize oil from the oil
|tank and give it to the engine.  Thus my sending oil all the way to the
|front grill to an aux cooler has no effect on engine oil pressure, altho it
|probably costs me some amount of power.

That's it, a dry sump conversion and huge oil tank.

|Does anyone know if there is a correct orientation for an oil cooler.  I
|have mine with fittings pointing down, so that I don't have to worry about
|any sediment building up, but do I have to worry about air getting trapped
|in there?  Thanks!

Trapped air shouldn't be a problem as the flow is high enough to cause 
turbulence and flush out any remaining air. (Unless your using a small 
electric pump!!!)
