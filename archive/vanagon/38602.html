Subject: tires for 83 westy


I would like to hear some alternatives to the elusive &quot;xzx&quot; treads which 
no shop seems to carry.  Must I buy a reinforced sidewall?  Please let me 
know, money is burning a hole in my pocket.  

What I would really like is a good strong tire with raised white 
letters... am I dreaming?
