Thank goodnes for wrecking yards =)

The average price for a starter in a self serve wrecking yard is $15 - 
$25 and if you are able to change it yourself its free labor. or a good 
freind can usually be perwaded to swap one out for a six pack.

seriosly for those not wanting to do it themselves it takes about two 
hours labor at a dealers cost of $65 - $80 hr your just about in the 
right range there...
