Subject: Re: I finally got a VW Thing ('74)!

Congrats on joining those of us in the Thing 'club' - and the more 
exclusive VW Transporter Thing Multi-VW Club.  Your Thingie sounds even 
scarier than either of mine.  Maybe also the Thing prices on the East 
coast beat the west coast.  All the Things I've checked out have been 
from $900 to $1800 and all in better condition than your new toy. THough 
one of them was titled as a German made Type 3 (not sucha clear title on 
that one)

SO far finances have kept me from doing much work on mine - I've gotten 
new OEM tops the Trim Shop but haven't installed them yet.  Slow mode.  
Maybe I guess we ought to do the rest of our talking on the other VW 
lists though... 

But if any one else happens to read this - does anybodyd know anything about 
hitches for a Eurovan (for towing Things mostly)
