&gt; &gt; Last week I mentioned that a friend of mine was looking for a camper.
&gt; &gt; He found this at a dealer:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; '85 Westfalia, automatic, A/C, one owner, $6,950.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; miles unknown. We're going to check it out this afternoon, but I would
&gt; &gt; like to know all you people's opinions on what a fair price would be,
&gt; &gt; assuming the vehicle is in good shape.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; TIA!

&gt; Well now I am asking $4950 for my no A/C, standard trans. '85 Westy.
&gt; Weekender (ie Wolfsburg)
&gt; NADA says $5500 for 85 VW Campmobile....
&gt; FYI (For Y'alls Info)
&gt; -Larry
&gt; '85 Westy.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 

recently sold my '85 Weekender Westy w/auto, ac, 115k for $4,100... 
could've gotten more if i hadn't written out all the problems and 
gave to each potential buyer  :)
