Subject: Back Door Bonk

When I open up the back door on my &quot;new&quot; '89 Syncro, the two cylindrical
doohickeys (isn't that what Bentley calls them?) hold up the door just
long enough for me to get my arms full of the stuff I'm trying to unload
and then begin to let go, eventually bonking me in the head if I don't
duck out of the way in time.

Is there a way to recondition these things?  Maybe (hopefully) just
relube the plunger seals?
