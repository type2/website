Yo,

	I'm gettin' ready to get a set of tires for the bus.

	I really want whitewalls. I priced them, and they're about $92
apiece for bias ply and $130 for radials.  THats with the wide whitewalls.

	I saw a single cab in town the other day with the stick on
ones, and I think I could live with those.  They actually looked decent!

	So, where do you get those again?

	Also - are bias-ply tires really &quot;bad?&quot;  I'd be driving on them a
lot, and I'm wondering how the handling is relative to radials.  The bias
plys seem kinda skinny...

	Thanks!

Thom
