Subject:      69 camper



I posted a similar not on vintagvw last night. It was last night that my wife
had us go look at a 69 camper. This despite the fact that I already have tow
sick buses, a 68 &amp; 71. Well I was pretty impressed. the 69 is in better shape
than either the 68 or the 71, though the trany is shot. We are thinking of
taking the first two and end up with the one good 69. The main question I
posed on vintagvw had to do with putting the disc brakes from the 71 on the
69. Joel, I appreciated your initial reply to this. I am wondering, if it can
be done, how? Does the whole front end have to be replaced or only part?

I am a little concerned about turning into a westy. I was hoping to ask all of
you some questions about the camper. Like, what does that external 120 volt
plug go to? Does the cot on top really have a tendency to fall in older buses?
Was I surprised to look in the engine compartment and find a gasoline heater
taking up the left side. Was this standard? Are they safe? I had heard of them
but never seen one. Also, can you really not replace the tent material on top
for under _at_ $270?

     Well, I will keep you up on what we do. The kid who owns it bought it at
an auction and knows nothing of its history nor does he know anything about
vws at all. Since he hasn't driven it much, what with the trany screwed up, he
doesn't know anything abut its performance either. I will say that it had the
oldest air filter. There is a tube with an elbow that turns to the the right
about 12&quot; long. Well, if we go for it we will be offering $400.
