Subject: year differences on late Vanagons?

Well, I've decided to upgrade my '80 Westy to a later one.  I have
two other '86's and would like to go with that engine and all.  My
wife wants a '90 or '91 (no reason, just it seems like something made
this decade).  I'd like to find out all the nitpicky changes for the
87 and on Vanagon's, particularly in the Westy's.  I know that they
added those nifty armrests in 87...  Are there any meaningful changes
of note?  Any changes on the Syncros through the years?  I'm looking
at an '87 Syncro Westy, and inquiring minds want to know...

Are there any engine/trans/suspension/brake differences in the post '85
line?  Seems like a long time for VW to remain the same, but there seem
to be no major changes I know of.

I know there is a page on one of the web sites, but can't recall where,
and remember it not having much details.  I know the later years added
a lot of fluff, like the bigger VW emblem up front, and no chrome window
trim.  When did the rear window flow-through vents get added?  When did
they go to the fancy non-functional bumpers?  How about the heat or no heat
in the forward vents?  Any additional lights/cupholders/convieniences added
in later models?

I never knew what the &quot;little switch&quot; spoken of was -- my '80 Westy has
none, just one extra LED.  Funny the little changes they did.
