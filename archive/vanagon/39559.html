Subject: Import auto parts in Des Moines


As a result of an earlier post I decided to check this place out and they 
did in fact have the best prices on several items.  I ordered Brake 
shoes, hardware, and two wheel cyls for about $65 including shipping 
which was only $4.50.  Everything seems to be good quality, the cyls are 
marked Italy and the shoes are from Canada.  My only complaint is that 
they didn't tell me the shoes were re-man. 3 original manufacturers are 
represented in 4 shoes and the friction surface on one of the trailing shoes
is about 1/4 inch longer than the other.  I am thorougally impressed by 
their shipping time.  I got everything in 4 business days via u.p.s.  
check em out.

&gt; I just bought a set of Wasserboxer gaskets for less than 1/2 dealer price

&gt; They are willing to UPS anywhere and have been in business for many years.
