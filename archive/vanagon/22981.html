Subject: Re: #3 retard



To All:

With regards to the Volkswagen sedan, the 4 degrees of retardation ground
into the #3 lobe of VW distributors was discontinued with the introduction of
the engines equipped with dog-house coolers in 1971.  I've heard different
stories regarding other engines types.  

Since there are many different distributors, and since their parts are
interchangeable, the only way to be sure of what you're running is to put the
distributor on a distributor machine and check it out.  Measuring the
cam-lobes with a surface plate and machinists protractor can give ambiguous
results due to the shape of  the lobes and accumulated wear.  Iyour system is
tight and you're running a degree wheel you can usually see SOME retard by
clipping your strobe light to #3 plug wire, but it's hard to say if you're
seeing three degrees or four degrees.
