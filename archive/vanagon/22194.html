Subject:  exhaust manifold replacement

got a new (used) left exhaust manifold (CA emissions setup) this
weekend from a fellow list member (thanks again jeff!).  wrapped it in
header tape because the heat shield had come off.  went to put it on - it
didn't fit!  the distance between the bolts, from port to port, is 2-3
millimeters too short, just enough so it really won't go on the bolts.  the
same thing happened when i took the old one off and had it welded -
went to put it back on and it was too short (except i thought that the
welding shop guy screwed it up).  i tried using a car jack to bend the
welded one, but it just popped back when the jack was removed. 
options? i was thinking about taking it to a shop and having them heat it
and move the ports farther away, but this seems like  a sketchy
proposition.  i would think it should fit.  am i missing something here? 
please help, and thanks in advance.

thanks,
matthew
