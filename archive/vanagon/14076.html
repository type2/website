Subject: Oil cooler/heater

At the weekend I visited the Motorsports show at Shefield to buy some safety 
gear and picked up a huge stack of manufacturers bumf. One of them shows a 
heater, specially for VWs that comprises an oil cooler matrix with a small 
fan attatched, an oil take off plate and a thermostatic switch. The price is 
a bit stiff at 135 UKpounds, and I've seen homemade setups done for a lot 
less, but it looks like a neat installation. It might be worth getting their 
catalogue just  to copy the design.

FYI the place is called Europa and their address is
Fauld Industrial Park
Tutbury
Burton upon Trent
Staffordshire
England
DE13 9HR
