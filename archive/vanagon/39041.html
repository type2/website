Thanks for the gentle reminder of needing to define units.  In my
case, I'm using U.S. gallons and miles.  I suspect that the miles and
gallons referred to above differ somewhat, as I have trouble believing
40+ out of an aircooled microbus (unless it's going downhill all the
way, which seems a tad impractical to arrange, particularly in
Europe).
