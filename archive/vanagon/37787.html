&gt;I recently started having a vibration problem with my 87' Syncro.  The
&gt;vibration is very pronounced within the van but i cant hear much from
&gt;outside.  I think i have a problem with either a transmission of engine
&gt;mount.  Yesterday i jacked up the front of the transmission (slightly) and
&gt;the vibration ceased.  The two mounts appear to be in good condition but i
&gt;think thats my problem.  Anyway, how tough is it to replace these mounts in
&gt;the Syncro, and has anyone had a similiar problem??  I'm going to look into
&gt;it more today.  Bently is pretty vague concerning these mounts in the
syncro.

Your vibration is probably related to the driveshaft.  Have you checked the
universal joints at each end?  There should be no play.  Reapiring these
shafts is an iffy thing at best.  they seem to have all sorts of balance
problems after repair.  You will either need a very good drive shaft shop or
plan on buying new shaft from dealer.
