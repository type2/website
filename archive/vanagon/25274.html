Subject: experience with VW rebuilts?


I'm close to going with a VW rebuilt motor for my
'81 Vanagon.

Anyone have experience with VW rebuilts?  Good?
Bad?

Know where they are rebuilt?  (Here they think maybe
Canada--at least the watercooled come from there.)

Email me and I'll summarize any good info.  Thanks,
