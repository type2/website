Today I got my new muffler installed. After watching the trouble that
the guy at Midas had, I am glad I had them do it instead of trying to
replace it myself (it was worth the approx $50 labor). They had to
order the muffler for my Vanagon, but (surprise) it came in within the
2 days that they promised. It is so nice not to hear my engine rumble
and roar.

Next project... Am waiting for boots for my rack and pinion to come in
(the old ones are shot). They are supposed to be here by Monday.
