&gt;&gt; What seat did you put in? How higher are they? Does your head now rub

&gt;&gt; Enquiring minds want to know.

I've seen porsche 914 seats put in, sporty etc. and definately lower height 
than original van seats. I don't know what the installation took however. I 
once put a set of armchair front seats, from a '72 Citroen DS, in a '75 
Kombi. A piece of 3/4&quot; plywood bridged the walkthrough, and the seat rails 
were bolted into the wheel well at the outside, through the plywood on the 
inside. They were so thick and cushy that my legs didn't easily reach the 
pedals, I got back of the legs cramps. I also had visions of the plywood 
side tearing loose in a crash, but then maybe I was fantasizing too much. 
Seats protect you in a rear end collision, if they rip out and spill you 
backwards you may break your neck against the rest of the stuff in the back 
of the bus. But then again, if you sit in front of 3000 lbs. of metal at 
60mph how much protection do you have anyhow?
