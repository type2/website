Subject: Cost of Heater Core

Hi Volks,
        I called the &quot;VW dealer&quot; here in Traverse City, MI to check on the
cost of a rear heater core for my '86.
        When the parts guy got back to me he first apologized, I knew that
this was going to be bad news. Over $800!! We discussed the part, and we
agreed that that was what I wanted. It was NOT the whole box, just the
heater core.
        Wow.
        
        Rob
