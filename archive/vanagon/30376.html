So RGOLEN_at_umassd_dot_edu says:

&gt; Isn't it nice to have a VW van that has heat!  8)

Now Ric, why do you imply that there is a lack of heat to all Vanagons?
I understand that the air-cooled ones take a while to heat, but the
watercooled ones will cook you out if you're not careful.  Usually,
when I first get started in the morning, I can get the heat going
fairly soon like a normal car and then I really have to be diligent
about getting the heater lever turned down.  It takes a while to find
a comfortable position with the heater lever and I'm never too cold.
Are other folks not getting warm enough with the water cooled vanagon?
