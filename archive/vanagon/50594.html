&gt;I hate that too.  I remember one time I was behind this culo-hole driving
&gt;an 84 brown and tan aircooled.  I waved at him from behind and he, for
&gt;the duration of the trip home, stuck his middle finger at me.  I wanted
&gt;to kick his culo and slap him a few times ( being from the South Bronx,
&gt;slapping another guy is the most disrespectful thing you can do to
&gt;someone), but he looked like a miserable slob.  Maybe his life is taking
&gt;care of him for me.  Upstate NY people!

that was no miserable slob ... that was my WIFE!!
ba-da-boom! ;)
&lt;same joke, differnet act&gt; :)
