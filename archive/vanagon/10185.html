Subject: Re: Source requested - curtain parts

Mine was shy of those plastic pieces, too -- I found 'em in various 
junkyards.  In fact, as I recall I thought of hoarding them for a while...:-)

They were apparently considered part of the curtains -- no separate part 
number.  However, the Gardinenfeststeller* (little block with set screw - 
&quot;curtain stopper&quot;), PN 231 067 895 might just be available at your local 
dealer, along with bud vases and fuel-tap extensions. :-)

*izznt part of der choy of Folksvahgens haffing der opportunity to say 
all dese kool vords?  Ab und zu musz Man doch etwas Spasz haben, nicht war?

Spater,
Joe
