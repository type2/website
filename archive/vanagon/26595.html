Just to be absolutely clear: prices are in german marks. Marks used to
be quite a bit cheaper than USD ($). Don't know about current exchange
rate; depends on how well Mr Clinton and CO is doing compared to Herr
Kohl (or whoever it is now).

&gt; Hi, will do, thanks. The prices you showed were high! Scary $$$ for a single 
&gt; tourist. Perhaps buying a good NA model and shipping it over is worth it for 
&gt; the long run, especially if you were sharing/planning on annual visits.
