So Derek Drew says:
&gt; 
&gt; Even if I bought a brand new tank tomorrow, I would immediately sawzall the
&gt; label off and sand/paint the area. Trying to seal the edges of the label
&gt; against the tank with sealent will not help as I tried that and all the
&gt; silicone does is trap moisture under there. Trying to squirt rust
&gt; neutralizer under the label will not work as I tried this too to no benefit. 
&gt; 
&gt; The fact is, the label has to come off!
&gt; 
&gt; Every Camper owner on this list be advised that you have a bad situation
&gt; under there. I urge you to see if you can work that label off at the next
&gt; opportunity.

What is the liability of not having that label on there?  Isn't it suppose
to be left on?  Can you clarify this?  I'd like to remove mine, but I just
want to know the legal ramifications.
