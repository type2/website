&gt;&gt; Volks,
&gt;&gt; Having dealt with the dilemma of trying to cool the air in my 82 diesel
&gt;&gt; Westy for some years now in Baja Calif, I've come up with this:
&gt;&gt; I use a Toyotomi 4000btu portable air-conditioner inside the van. It's the
&gt;&gt; most efficient, small A/C unit I've found.
&gt;&gt; That coupled with a Honda EX 650 mounted outside on either the front or
&gt;&gt; rear bumper. It uses .5gal of gas every 4 hrs. Is so quiet no one notices
&gt;&gt; it's on.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; With this setup, my 1.6L diesel isn't over taxed ( more overtaxed, I should
&gt;&gt; say) and I've got air whenever I need it.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Works for me.

I'll get all the info I can and post it to the group but it may take a
while...It may be a day or two as it's been 5 years since i bought it,
