&gt; &gt; Again, you don't have to change heads to go from 1.7 to 1.8.  The most you

&gt; &gt; am almost positive that you can make a 1.8 into a 2-liter by using 2 liter
&gt; &gt; pistons, barrels, rods, and crank.  You can even cut down the old 1.8 liter
&gt; &gt; crank to a 2 liter one.  My source for this is &quot;How to rebuild your Air-
&gt; &gt; Cooled VW Engine&quot;, and numerous discussions with machine-shop guys.

&gt; 
&gt; My experience on this has been that 1700 heads don't fit on an 1800 engine.
&gt; Replacing one of the heads on my `74 (1.8) I was accidentally sold a 1.7l
&gt; head and it definitely didn't fit on the barrels of my bus; I tried it and it
&gt; was too small.  Now how's that for a descrepency in the data?  :)

Ooops...  hehe
Okay, I did say the heads might have to be flycut.  =)  I guess all of the
1700 heads I have seen were already flycut for larger barrels.  The machine
shop guys tell me that most people go to 1.8 barrels when rebuilding 1.7's.
