&gt;&gt;control which we all know is mostly a form of consumer blackmail. 
 Especially
&gt;
&gt;now, as to &quot;blackmail&quot; ... well, i don't know. i mean, it's not like 
they're
&gt;gonna tell everyone about Steve and that chicken last summer if he doesn't
&gt;buy a new car ...

I wasn't there. Nobody saw me do it. And the chicken volunteered.


&gt;and if we were still riding horses, think of all the pollution-preventing
&gt;devices the poor horse would have to wear!!! :)

Just a large cork?


&gt;can you imagine how different your life would be if you lived within 
walking
&gt;distance of your work, your grocery store, and ALL the places you needed to
&gt;go???

I do.
But these are not all the places I *want* to go.

Happy Friday, all...
