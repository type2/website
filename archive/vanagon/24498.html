Subject: Help: A fair price?

Hi all!  I found a '79 Westy in good condition, no body
rust, interior is nice though could use a good cleaning,
and the camping gear works...at least he says that it 
does (I was in sort of a rush).  What would be a reasonable
price for this?  I went to the store to check out the N.A.D.A.
book, but that's exactly what I found, Nada.  It only goes
back to the early Vanagons, no bread loafs and no camper options.
I'd be interested in a range much like they do in that book, ie.
Low Price, Average, High.  I want to make a fair offer, but being 
a student I can't be tooooo extravegent with the ol' budget.
Any help is appreciated especially if someone has a recent copy 
of NADA that includes the bread loaves.  Thanks.
