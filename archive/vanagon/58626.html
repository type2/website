Subject: Timing, Redlines, and Shift Points

Utta (80 westi) is finally running, thanks to AVP and my fiance and Rob
&quot;dudeman&quot; Marshall.  This is my newest volksie and first T4 and I have a few
easy questions:

1. Is the factory's spec of 7.5 btdc the way to go or is it better somewhere
else?
2. Redline for T4 engines?  (I'm really into dusting corvettes)
3. What are the recommended shift points? (I am manual-less at this point)

Thanks, Patrick and Utta                     Pfunky_at_aol_dot_com
