&gt; Moral: secure the load.  VW did not provide factory tie-downs worth
&gt; crap on the trucks, and nothing in the Kombis and panels to speak of.  I have

On this thread I will inject a bit of modification I have perfomed to 
deal with this situation of loose cargo.  I have a '80 Westi, but 
this will work on most campers.

There are many locations in the interior that are secured with a bolt.  
Edges of the mattress snaps on the upper bunk, fittings for the 
cabinetry, hinges, etc.

At most of those locations I removed the screw/bolt, and added a short 
length (4-6 in) of single thickness nylon webbing, doubled over, and 
re-installed the bolt/screw.

This provides a convenient loop for passing a rope through, attaching 
a caribiner, etc to tie down loads or setting up a screen for holding, 
stopping/slowing down cargo.

BTW, use a really long piece on the end of the upper bunk bed that 
folds over and you have a convenient handle for unfolding the bunk.

As I have expounded on before, I rolled my '76 camper, and the 
amount of loose stuff in a bus is astounding.  Thus I tend to try and 
tie things down.
