Just curious, Steve, Is your '92 a Vanagon or Eurovan?  Here in the U.S.
Vanagons were sold until '91('90 here in California), nothing in '92 and
Eurovans in '93.

I have limited experience with brakes, one change in 136k on my '90
Carat, and I did change the rotors. I was told that the rotors are
usually too thin machine. Now on my '86 Syncro I was able to machine the
rotors this last time, but will have to change next time. The rear drums
generally go much farther before they have to be changed.
