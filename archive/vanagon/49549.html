Hi All,

It's been relatively cool in the mornings recently, cool
enough to test out the '84 Vanagon's heater cores.  When I
dropped off my 3 1/2 yr old son at daycare, he commented
that Brownie Bus has something in it making him warm.  I
explained to him that this VW Bus *has* a heater!  8-)
Well, the others do too, but they don't quite perform the
same.

On the last leg of the drive to work (about 7 miles) I 
was pleasantly surprised to get behind my friend's
chocolate brown 58 Westy.  What a sight for sore eyes, 
seeing a split window Bus amongst all the sport-utility
and jelly bean-shaped vehicles out here in the burbs.
