     My wife went by this AM and picked a bunch of small parts from the
     Vanagon Westie. She reports that the Westie is getting a lot of
     attention, so you all ought to go by (buy?) soon. The attendant also
     pointed out a regular Vanagon there, though it did not have much
     interest for us.
