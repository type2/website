Subject: Re: Vanagon with Chevy V6

steve&gt; Route choices seem to be mostly I-40, I-20, I-10-- and later I-8
steve&gt; in Arizona if/when I get that far. Anybody have experience with
steve&gt; these roads between Mizzou and California? Suggestions on routes
steve&gt; to take or avoid? Advice on any chronic ailments to watch out
steve&gt; for in '80 Vanagons (aside from engine, of course)?

        Been on 40 &amp; 10 betwixt Austin and CA, can't tell much of a
difference. I guess there's more &quot;Indian&quot; souvenir shops on 40, but the
veiw is pretty similar. If you go 10 (or 20 I suppose) you can crash out
here. A bit out of the way for 20 but in line with 10 if you take state
road 290 from Houston-might even shoten the journey a bit. Good luck.

Peace,
