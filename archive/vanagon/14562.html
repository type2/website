The Second Rebuild


Banging and knocking in the traveling van
The driver cannot hear the radio;
Things fall apart; the castings cannot hold;
Mere profanityy is loosed upon the world;
An oil-stained tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of Muir is forgotten;
The best lack the right tool, while the worst
Are making alternate plans.

Surely some expense is at hand;
Surely the Second Rebuild is at hand.
The Second Rebuild! Hardly are those words out
When a vast image out of The Bently Manual
Troubles my sight; somewhere in the sands of the desert
A shape with vanagon body and the head of a man,
A gaze as blank and pitiless as a dealer,
Is moving its stubby fingers, while all about it
Scurry bay-boys and parts guys.
The darkness drops again; but now I know
That ninety thousand miles of steady power
Were vexed to nightmare by a faullty wristpin,
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
Slouches towards Wolfsburg to be born?




Alistair, with big apologies to W.B. Yeats fans
