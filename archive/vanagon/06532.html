Subject: stove=heater=safe?


I'm a little confused about this matter of catalytic converters and
their relative safeness.  Must they be vented to be safe?  If they
are not vented, how would it differ, say, from me using my built-in
westy stove to heat the interior of the car while camping?  For
that matter, the stove is vented, so wouldn't that qualify?

dazed and confused...
