  The little bottles aren't that bad. I carry a powder type which I've
  had to use when my engine caught fire. A badly placed engine seal vibrated
  down onto the silencer and so went up, setting fire to various other bits
  n pieces. (all my fault tssk tssk). The extingusher had an amazing amount
  of powder in it that put out the fire instantly and covered my unfortunate
  passenger at the same time. Most of the plastic bits around the engine had 
  melted, but after some cleraing up and emergency rewiring, off I 
  went. 

  After that I bought a slightly bigger powder type with a pressure 
  gauge, so you can see if its going to work when needed, just to be
  on the safe side!
