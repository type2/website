Subject: Directions to Stuft Pizza

&gt; 
&gt; The address is 191 Castro in Mountain View. Patrick, would be so kind
&gt; and give us all some direction from the closest HiWay off-ramp?
&gt; 
Here goes:

Get yourself onto 101 (hopefully people can figure out how to get there
from their various home-bases), and take the Moffet Blvd. exit toward
Mountain View (as opposed to toward Moffet Field).  This exit is just
south of the 85 interchange, to give you a point of reference.
Follow Moffet until it crosses Central Expressway.  You will now be
magically transported to the 100 block of Castro (the street changes
names at Central).  Stuft will be near the end of the block on the left.

Hope to see everyone there.  As far as a headcount goes, I am painfully
single at the moment, so I will be just one...
