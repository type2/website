So Gary Nichols says:
&gt; 
&gt; When the engine is cold, it appears that the right flap is almost closed
&gt; (down), and the left flap is up, exposing the oil cooler, while shutting some
&gt; of the air off to the cylinders.  When things heat up and the thermo cable
&gt; gets longer, the right flap goes up (opening) and the left flap goes down,
&gt; opening the air flow up to the cylinders, while CLOSING OFF THE OPENING TO THE
&gt; OIL COOLER!  This bothers me immensely.  Is there air flow here that is not
&gt; obvious? Does the air flow to the oil cooler actually decrease at high temp?
&gt; This is really bugging me. Somebody straighten me out please!

Gary,

The left flap should be a 2 piece hinged affair and the lower piece should
be tucked under the top piece.  Do you have it this way.  If not, the lower
portion would, indeed, cover the oil cooler.  With the bottom part folded
toward the rear, the oil cooler should still get some cooling air.
