Hello!
  I'm having a couple problems with my '77 bus.

First, the turn signals don't work.  Further, when I pull the emergency
flasher, I burn fuse 6 (or 7?)  Does it make sence that the problem is
just the emergency flasher switch?

Next, the bus doesn't like starting cold.  It's having fuel delivery
problems, but I'm not sure what the best way to go about
troubleshooting/fixing the problems.  I know the temperature sensor is
fine, and I tested the thermo-time switch (per Haynes Manual cold start
valve leads), and it seems no good.  Next, I pulled the injectors (I just
got the bus, so don't bother me about lack of maintenance), and there was
bad news.  One injector had nothing, one was bad, one was good, and it was
too late in the evening to check the last one or the cold start valve.  Do
I need to drain the tank and replace fuel lines and everything (it sat ~6
months before I got it)?  What is the next thing I should check?

Wasn't there someone who was selling a complete FI system on here a while
back?

Finally, although it is embarrassing (sp?) to ask this, where is the fuel
filter?  The Haynes manual isn't designed for the 2000 cc, and it hasn't
just jumped out at me as I've looked a bit.

Thanks in advance!
