Subject: Re: Spare tire question

&gt;wrestling. Since changing to  195 75R14 tires (including spare)

always had this size on, just slam the spare tire carrier and it latches.
Some folks have 27/8.5 BIG tires which fit in there, so I am surprised that
the 205/70s won't go in with a  quick slam.  I have a set, but they are on,
not spare.  Must try the test some time.  Tim
