Subject: Instrument lighting, fan switch replacement
Date: Thu, 10 Jul 1997 10:05:19 -0500 (EDT)

On my '84 Vanagon, it seems that the instruments are lit from above by
a bulb behind a white translucent plastic piece that fits into
rectangular hole above the instrument. The clock/fuel/temp guage is lit 
up nicely, but the speedometer isn't lit at all. I can see the light
from a lamp up to the side of the rectangular hole, but the white plastic 
piece for the rectangular hole is out of place. Is there any way to get to 
it, and put it back correctly? I didn't see any obvious means of
entry.

The fan switch is stuck solidly on fan position 3. Any clues on
unsticking it? If it can't be unstuck, is it straightforward to
replace?

The PO put on three tacky wheel covers that look like rejects from the 
Pontiac design bin. There is one of the original, alloy-wheel-look caps 
with the VW black center emblem and five fake black lug nuts. Does anyone 
have a set of three of them for sale?

Thanks,
Paul Henderson
