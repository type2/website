Subject: GNATT meet-ups in Bay Area?, Braided stainless steel over &lt;?&gt; hoses

	Dave's GNATT itinerary ended like this for me:

&gt;Saturday, Sunday, June 17-18th.
&gt;	Stay in Yosemite, tour the valley, hike, etc..
&gt;
&gt;------------------------------
&gt;
&gt;Topic No. 5

	So where do us bay area types join? Or is this not for
lightwieghts? :-)  My notes from a month ago suggest that the GNATT
arrives in the Bay Area one Monday, June 19. Where do we meet? 




	Eugene Palmer mentioned the braded stainless steel over &lt;?&gt; hoses
his external oil cooler uses.  Engines and oil coolers don't move
around all that much relatively, but I have to pass-on a story about
stainless steel-over-teflon brake hoses that I heard from Bruce Anderson,
the Technical Director of Porsche Club of America. Race cars are almost
always seen with braided stainless flexible brake hoses, and so lots
of people logiclally think they must be better for the street. They
DO improve pedal feel, no question.

	Problem is, the stainless steel wire work hardens, particularly
at the place where the fittings are crimped on. Bruce Anderson recomended
against these parts for street use, noting that he'd never seen or heard
of a stock rubber brake hose breaking in use, while a friend of a friend
had wadded-up his 911 when the trick stainless steel braid hose broke
(at the fitting) one day. Bruce's friend's friend suddenly had half the
brakes he expected, and stuffed it into the back of whatever was in his
way.
	In an odd turn of luck, a cop was writing a ticket at the side
of the road and saw the whole business, saw that the Porsche started to
slow and then changed rates suddenly. The cop and driver walked back up
the road and found a splash of brake fluid, returned to the car
and found the failed hose. Result? No ticket!

	Has anyone in this group had a rubber or braided stainless
brake hose or oil line fail? The early type IV FI engines had a LOT
of engine fires because of fuel line problems, anyone here have one?

	Of course, one rap against the external oil coolers is that
the soft hoses balloon and reduce effective oil pressure. Braided
stainless would clearly help this. The big advantage of the engine mounted
oil cooler is that you can rigidly mount it- no relative motion to take
care of.
