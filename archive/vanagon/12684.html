&gt; Yeah, Thom, I saw this too. Were my eyeballs scrambled, or was that a bay-window
&gt; style bus with rear corner windows? (a-la 23 window style...)
&gt; 
&gt; If that was the case, I might consider shooting the dude to take his bus too! ;}

Sounds like the typical Brazilian bus to me!  You can check out pictures
of it at http://papaya.nosc_dot_mil/~schwarze/vw/brazil.html
