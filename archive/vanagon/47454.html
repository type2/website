&gt;So... after blowing the light the first time round... how in the hell do

&gt;it right the first time!

My own wife has decided that in order for the fridge to light, the mark
on the pump handle must point to the right. She came to this startling
realization after she had struggled hard, then spent an hour re-reading
the owners' manual and noticed that in the instructions for shutting
down the fridge, it said to turn valve &quot;A&quot; to the closed position, where
&quot;A&quot; on the figure is the pump handle. She said she was thrown off by the
fact that the controls on the figure all are shown in the closed
position, except for &quot;A&quot; which is shown open.

I must admit that it never had dawned on me that the pump handle
controlled an air vent somewhere, so I had put the above item in the
instructions down to writer's error, but she is dead sure that this
is the one factor that explains why she succeeded in lighting the
refrigerator after 2.5 hours of failure.

Respectfully submitted as &quot;one more thing to try&quot;.
