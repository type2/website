Subject: dropped my first engine!!!!!!!

Well today was a very exciting day as I removed the
engine from my new '62 Kombi.  Greg Merritt ('71 Sqbk, mostly
hangs out on the VINTAGVW list) came over to help
and tell me what to do.  

The reason I had to drop the engine was the front
engine tin rubber sealing stip was absent, and I
just couldn't get it to slide in from underneath.  I also
wanted to look around back there because the bus
has a 1600 dual port engine and has been converted
to 12V but the prev. owner didn't know if it had
a 12 volt starter or much else about the engine
specifics.

So, dropping it was pretty easy.  I undid all the electrical
stuff, the accell. cable (the heater wires were off already),
and the fuel line, put a board on my brand new Sears
trolly jack, and out it came.

The new rubber seal went in with a great deal of effort
(it's been outrageously hot and humid lately, which didn't
help) and I saw that I have a remanufactured 12V Bosch starter, and a
200mm flywheel with 130 teeth (if I counted right).  The engine
has an AE case ('71, I think) but a non doghouse cooler.  Kind
of a funny hybrid. Comments and advice about what I should 
look out for with a setup like this are welcome!

Putting it back in was a small adventure.  Up it went on the jack
and we were trying to install it when Greg's 10-month-old
daughter and fledgling VW mechanic Emily protested about 
being in a pack on Greg's back during the process (I think she
noticed that the jackpad was not centered very well under
the engine so the engine was tending to lean to the right).

So, we took a break, and when we were just about ready to 
go back to work it started to rain.  So we were working as fast
as we could but this bus still doesn't have all its windows
installed so on went the big blue tarp.  By this time
we were getting quite wet, but then I had the fine idea to
put up the rear hatch and drape the tarp over it, making a nice
little tent.  So we were dry and happy at least until the
water started to run along the ground we soon would have
to lie on.

A little more heaving and maneuvering and with a _very_
satisfying slide in it went (all you boys and girls know
this feeling :-) ).  Hooked up everything and called it
a day.  And a good time was had by all.........
