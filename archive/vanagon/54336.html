Subject: HELP IN UNSUBSCRIBING

I need help in unsubscribing.  (I also need help in keeping my fingers off
the tab key when I am composing e-mail; I sent the first message prematurely
:)  )

Seriously, I need to unsubscribe for awhile.  I am taking an on-line graduate
course and I have trouble sorting through my mail.  I tried sending an
UNSUBSCRIBE message to the listserv address and I still keep getting vanagon
traffic.  The instructions say to leave the subject line blank but AOL won't
let me send it unless the subject line is filled in.  Any suggestions?
