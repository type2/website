Subject: '87 Oil pressure NEED HELP!!

All,

I am looking at an '87 Vanagon GL to buy.  Everything seems great except the
following:

Idles low (to me) about 700-800 RPM.  After 5 minutes of hgwy driving the oil
light came on when it was at idle (with the AC on).  I have had several
Jettas and 70% of them have had problems with oil pressure sending system.
 Ie problem with the pressure sender not the pressure.  Is this a common
problem with Vanagons or is there really a problem with the oil pressure in
this one??

Please reply direct ASAP.  Thanks!!!!!!
