&gt; &gt; There are a *lot* of 'dem pesky busses out there. 
&gt; 
&gt; I think most of the concerns you've brought up Derek, are legitimate...But,
&gt; I prefer to cross those bridges when they really become necessary.  I wouldn't
&gt; mind giving better clues as to which make and year we were discussing if
&gt; that would make most of the folks out there happy.  This is so long as 
&gt; the original poster gets it in their subject line.  

I think that Vanagon and Eurovan owners should be limited to one post per
week.  =)
