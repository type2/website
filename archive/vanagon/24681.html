Subject: Joel, change the stats

To Joel and anyone else interested:  I have moved from NJ to NC with my
'79 westy.  It made the move with flying colors - 25 mpg with a heavy load.
Anyway, you can delete me from the NJ category. . . it was long overdue.
later.....

p.s.  I have applied for an American title which should complete the
importation process I have gone through.  Thanks to those who gave me
advice about getting my westy from that other country.
