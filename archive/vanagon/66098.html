Subject:      Oil Temp Guage for Waterboxer

I am adding an oil pressure guage to my Vanagon, and am also
considering an oil temperature guage.  Does anyone know a
good place to put the VDO sender on a Waterboxer???  Does
VDO make a sender that fits in the drain plug hole?  I can't
see where else to put the sending unit, since there is no
drain plate to drill into like on the air cooled motors.
