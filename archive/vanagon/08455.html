Subject: Re: Roof rack?  BRIGHT colors?

why not try Anthony Gelato in NJ. He custom makes just about any style/type
of roofrack you can think of. very nice quality. e-mail his wife at
gelato_at_vax88a.pica.army_dot_mil

His phone number is 201-347-4081


&gt;1995 will be the year of the 68.  It's getting some
&gt;body work, new curtains, and a general makeover.  What
&gt;I'm looking for is a roof-rack (it's not a pop-top) for
&gt;it, to handle the canoes, the kid, etc.  Anybody got one
&gt;they want to sell?
&gt;
&gt;Also, a call for opinions.  This group seems to always have
&gt;plenty ;)  so I figured this is a good source.  I want to
&gt;repaint the 68, top to bottom.  Right now it's a pretty dull
&gt;white.  I'm thinking about painting each below-window body
&gt;panel a different primary color.  The roof, posts, etc. would
&gt;be white again.  The rest of it would be, bright, shall we say.
&gt;
&gt;My friends here (except one artist friend) think the idea is
&gt;indeed poor, but they also think I'm crazy to even have the VW's
&gt;Da Spouse has indicated a refusal to be seen
&gt;anywhere near, much less in, such a vehicle.  Whaddaya think?
&gt;I'm still malleable on this one, so hammer away.
