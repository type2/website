yeah, don't we all  :(

&gt; occasionally the van will start &quot;bucking&quot; holding the pedal down has no
&gt; effect and the bus will buck and make slight popping noises, i already put
&gt; some fuel injector cleaner in and same thing happens, after awhile it will
&gt; go away. electrics im guessing, any ideas otherwise?

these were the same symptoms that cleaning my air flow meter cured 
(which is still running great, thank you).  see my earlier posts.... 
you DID save them, right?    :)
