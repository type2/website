Subject:  RE Fuel Injection problem found 

Volks: Well old Sunny_Side_Down rides again. I found the problem.
      Thanks for all the help. Several VW mechanincs told me it was
     the ignition switch. It wasn't.
    Someone said check all connections, and grounds. While doing this
   I found the double relay ground was loose. I tightened this, and 
  when I tried it again it wasn't fixed, but then I noticed Ross Perot's
 &quot;Great Sucking Sound&quot; coming from the south end of the van as it stopped.
When I started searching around, and under things, I found that
the hose from the air distributor to the decelleration valve
was disconnected. The engine was getting too much air. During starting in this 
warm weather, as the cold start valve supplies more gas, it would run at high 
revs when starting. In run mode, the mixture was just too lean to keep running.
Another symptom I missed was it took several seconds to wind down. I assumed
this was just engine momentum from the high revs. now I believe that it was
still getting some power from the lean mixture, just not enough to keep running.
This also caused several red herrings: The engine stopped turning just about
when the fuel pump stopped. I couldn't hear a loss of firing or ignition
because there wasn't one. The high revs. It sounded like a fuel related 
problem, because it was one, just a simple one. 

Thanks for the help volks
