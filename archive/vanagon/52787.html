Subject: VW vs. GM

Sean Bartnik (12/5/96) wonders &quot;why would VW risk their future and
reputation to
steal car designs and other sensitive information from a sh*t
company like GM??&quot;.

Quite simple Sean; the GM (especially the Adam Opel Div.) builds good cars.
These days, GM seems to be responding well to market conditions (see the
new minivans for USA/Europe). Costs seem to be under control (hello VW???)
and quality isn't bad (Buicks actually get high marks in the press for
assembly quality. Heck, even the latest F bodies are reported to be well
assembled.....). This is not the same company which &quot;foisted&quot; those
annoying 1100cc Kadetts on an unsuspecting world in the '60s/'70s'.

Check out the Cadillac Catera (nee Opel Omega). It may not be a 5 series,
but it's a fine effort by all accounts. True, I'd buy an A6 quatro but
that's not the point: GM is a serious and dangerous competitor with
valuable information in its computer data banks.....
