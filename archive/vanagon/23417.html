Subject: Re: VW's new Web site

Regarding the new VWOA webpage:

Rusty thinks that it is neat that the website exists but that at present it
is majorly weak coming from a major corporation with a major advertising
agency. My VW dealer insider source says that the new ad campaign will go
public in October, 95. This may be the reason for the hold back/under
construction status of this major corporations' Web page. I can't say much
because I don't even have image number one on the Web (yet).

The initial image is pretty cool. If any list member hasn't been able to
check it out yet, the initial image is of a roadway with typical midwestern
US low wheat-ish growth on either side leading off toward the horizon of
blue sky with high clouds. The main leadline caption is &quot;On the road of life
there are passengers and there are drivers. &lt;VW logo&gt; then subheadline
&quot;Drivers Wanted.&quot; 

I inquired with the dealer source regarding the availability of any posters
with the main image on it. I was told that there is in fact a series of
posters being used by the dealers (only). Not available to the public. One
of the posters has an image of a dusty run down bar (tavern/pub) out in the
middle of the S.W. USA desert with several outlaw Harleys lined up in front
of it. At the end of the line is a Red '96 Jetta GTI with some special GTI
wheels on it. Heath, myself, and others would probably love to have one of
these! =)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Just tried it, but the graphic on the front page, which seems to be a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;clickable image only takes me to itself. Huh? nice picture, but don't have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;time to hang out there all day.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Same problem here. But try clicking on the *word* &quot;roadmap.&quot; Then, when it
&gt;&gt;&gt;says &quot;no data found&quot;, just click the RELOAD button.
&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;Thanks! That worked.
