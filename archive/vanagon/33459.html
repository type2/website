This might sound bark stonkers coming from me and my EV troubles, but I
wouldn't get any extended warranties.  I did with a Toyota Jelly Bean van I
bought a few years back, got home and read the fine print, then took it
back and cashed it in.  Waste of money, big time.  A friend of mine had an
Isuzu Trooper that he paid 850 bucks for a 100K warranty.  Valve burned at
80K.  He went to the dealer at the same time the insurance adjuster did
(they sold the warranty, not the manufacturer)  to inspect it.  Guy looked
into the water jacket in the head and pronounced &quot;this vehicle has not been
adequately maintained&quot;, which voided the warranty on the spot.  We got an
85K extended warranty for our Mitsubishi Montero for about the same price.
I think the only thing I did on that thing during 85K miles was change the
timing belt.  Warranty and money are gone.  So, that was what I was
thinking when they called me about the extended warranty.  With any luck, I
will have no more mechanical problems with my EV (most due to stupidity and
working out of bugs) by the time the stock warranty runs out.  I like to do
my own mechanical work (like that sense of responsibility that gives me!
8^O), so as long as the Bently's are available, I'd just as soon not have
to worry about being able to prove that I changed the oil every 3K miles
(YES!  the extended warranty on the jellybean required that I do it that
often.  I've been on vacations longer than that!).  Hope that helps.
Consumer reports (our buddies!) even warns about these, don't they?
