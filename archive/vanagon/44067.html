&gt;Hi,
&gt;Not too long ago someone wrote of their experience with Bridgestone Duelers.
&gt;I've lost the message.  But tires are past due (hence the 15&quot; wheel post
&gt;again).  Does anyone know about Bridegestone Dueler A/T's - 27x8.5x14?

That might have been me.  I had Bridgestones on a while back, but switched to
BFGoodrich Radial All-Terrain T/A tires when they needed replacement.  The
Bridgestones were fine but choose the BFG because I'd heard good things about
their quality and they have an additional side-wall ply compared with just
about every comparable tire.  This can be important when off-roading.
 
&gt;Sorry to dredge up the tire issue again, but I really need to buy tires.  My
&gt;185SR14 passenger car tires (done by PO) have finally given up the ghost.

Double check with the tire dealer about the minimum reccommended rim width
that these tires should be used with.  There's no problem with the 6&quot; wide
Vanagon alloy wheels, but the 5.5&quot; steel wheels may be a little too narrow -
depending on the particular tire &amp; maker.  I had the Bridgestones on my steel
wheels before I got my alloys and they &quot;seemed&quot; fine, but I'd double check
just to make sure.  

Also, putting the 27&quot; LT wheel in the spare tire position (yes, get a spare
to match) is a bit of a chore.  It does fit in there, but you'll probably
want to install a few large washers between the tire tray &amp; the mounting hole
to give you a little extra room.

Good luck,
