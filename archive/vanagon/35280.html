Subject: Engine or head supplier - 84 

If BarsLeak doesn't do it for me:
I am looking for a suggestion on where to get a head, or perhaps a 
rebuilt 1.9L wasserboxer for my 84.  I live in Vancouver, Canada, but 
could drive down the coast say as far as Portland to get a decent 
deal.  If there is anyone who can recommend a decent shop, or even a 
list-member backyard mechanic I would entertain the idea of traveling 
down in the next month for some VW medical aid.

FYI: The cost of a VW replacement engine installed in Vancouver is
$3000 US 

thanks in advance,
brian.
