Well, my engine is now out of my '81 and covered with a tarp.  I'm going to
get a long block, so I am guessing I am about 1/4 done.  I divided the job
into removing the engine, removing all the stuff from my long block,
installing all the stuff on the new long block, and installing the engine.
Is it reasonable to consider each of these to be about 1/4?

Thanks again for all the help.

Bill
