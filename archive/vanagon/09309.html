Subject: CV Boots, accel &amp; clutch cables

	Friends,
	You'll recall I bought the '70 single cab sans motor. I'm planning
to pull the axle with visibly torn boots and have boots and/or CVs replaced.
I'm also going to bleed brakes and grease anything with a grease fitting.

	1: How can I tell if I need to replace the front (fif) 
transmission mount?

	2: Should I go ahead and do both axles, all 4 CVs, at the same
time?

	3: Should I just go ahead and replace the clutch and accelerator
cables?

	4: As long as the engine bay's empty, does anyone have
recomendations on treating the light surface rust in the void behind
the gas tank? Or do I think too much? :-)

	Between holidays, rain and a cold, I've done nothing for my
new jewel except clean the windows and take its picture.

	Is there anything else *you'd* do if you had the engine out?

	Finally, I need a nose VW emblem, sunvisor clips, a shift knob
and isn't there supposed to be a sheet-metal cover under the pedals and 
master cylinder? If anyone has such, to fit a '70 or similar, let
me know!


	Bill Abbott
