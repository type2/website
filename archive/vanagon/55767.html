Subject: Re: Tierra del Fuego/Darrien Gap 

Those of you who want to chance the Darrien Gap, this site lists some
resources and has pix.  It is off an Australian 4WD page...   

        www.sofcom_dot_com.au/4WD/4WD.html

once in there move down a bit to 'The References'  and select 'The world',
then look for the Darrien Gap stuff.  This is one of the best 4WD sites IMHO. 

 Anyone got a site for the highways in South America? Pan-Amazonian and
several newer versions.  These are almost impassable reportedly in rainy
season. I have an Uruguayan student who is heading home this summer, he
would likely bring some maps if I bribe him enough :)  Tim
