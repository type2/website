Subject: Re: Speaking of being stopped by the cops....

My son was stopped here in Wichita, KS one fine April '94 evening.  Our
DVgon had plates from Illinois (expiration date of May '95).  The
officer cited him for having &quot;expired&quot; plates&quot; and told him he must call
for a tow as the DVgon was not drivable.

My wife and I went to his rescue, examined the citation, and made haste
for the nearest police station.  The citation was for EXPIRED 1994
plates!!!!  We all waited at the police station for 3 hours until the
commander-on-duty finally said the citation would be voided.  The only
reason given for the mistake was &quot;we do not have many out-of-state
plates here in Wichita.&quot;

We tried to ask how a town with an active Air Force base, Air Force
Reserve base, Boeing, Cessna, LearJet, Raytheon-Beech, Kansas Newman
College, Friends University, and Wichita State University not have
out-of-state plates???  No response, no surprises! ;)
