Subject: Four Speed Wasserboxers?

Hi all,

I've just been reading Vanagon list #1298 re.'82 Crew Cab and would a
wasserboxer gearbox fit.Chris said it wouldn't and I believe this is so,
however I was curious about the comment that the WBX's in the US were
all only 4 speed except for diesel and syncros.Is that the situation
stateside? All 2WD Waterboxers imported into Australia were all 5 speed
(with a real 5th gear not an overdrive)and as far as I am aware that
was the case from 1984 on.Syncros are all 4 speed plus a crawler gear as in
the US.I was interested as it seems you guys were treated much more
poorly than in Oz.We got Panel Vans,Window Vans,Caravelles,Carats,
Single Cabs,Double Cabs,Hightops and Syncros (in any of the above body
shapes)and ALL were 5 speed except for(obviously)autos &amp; syncros.
Also all Double Cabs were 4 door from '88 on (correct me someone if I'm
wrong)

Just Curious

Steve O.

'92 Wasserboxer (5 speed)
'76 Double Cab (only 4)
