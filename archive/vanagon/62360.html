Subject: Heater Slider Lever

Had the heater slider lever cable cable replaced on recently acquired 82
Westphalia.  Still no heat coming out in either position, unless I also
turn on the auxiliary gas heater.

Mechanic says there will never be any heat unless the gas heater is on.
Sounds like a song and dance to me.

Any thoughts on what the problem is?
