Subject: Occasional Rough Running '86

So Jack Agnew says:
&gt; We have had several occasions where our '86 Westy suddenly began running 
&gt; VERY rough - as though it was going to stop - and after scaring us to 
&gt; death would be OK after stopping and going again.

This sounds like the old intermittent misfire problem that according to
the bulletin 92-01 happens to Digifant engines.  Now I don't believe you
have a Digifant engine and I'm not even sure yours is a Digijet either.
Joel will probably clarify this.  The fix for this is a harness # 025-
906-302 on the Digifant.  I still haven't got one for my car but it
only had the problem once.  Fortunately I knew about this one from the
list and was able to proceed after we shut off the engine and started
up again.  I'll bet yours is the same problem though.  Joel?
