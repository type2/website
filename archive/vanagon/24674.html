Sheesh, all this animal stuff.  People sometimes call me O'Bunny ('cause of 
the last name -- O'Heare -&gt; O'Hare -&gt; O'Rabbit -&gt; O'Bunny.  No probs.

&gt;Somebody previously said:
&gt;not a Grizzly, mind you ... more like a Panda with an attitude. :)

Somebody recently explained how to tell if it's a grizzly bear or a brown bear 
that's chasing you -- climb a tree.  The brown bear will climb the tree too, 
and faster than you do.  The grizzly will simply knock down the tree with you 
in it.
