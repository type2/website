Subject: Drivin' in Mean Wind


One trick to overcoming the mean head and side winds is to find a Big
18 wheeler going the speed you want to go and tailgate him.
The air in his slip stream will be a lot less extreme than elsewhere.
It also helps your fuel economy noticably.
The only downside is that you cannot see much so you've gotta keep an
eye on his brake lights and stay alert.
