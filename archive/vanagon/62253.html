Correct application for Sliding Doors and related parts are:

80-84
85-91

The seal is the same 80-91

&gt;I need another sliding door for my '84 van. (dove blue metallic, 
&gt;anyone know
&gt;of one in a yard that color??)
&gt;Anyway, I know of a '86 Dove blue metallic van that had a good slider 
&gt;door on
&gt;it, and tried to swap it with my '84 but it won't work. (rear latching 
&gt;mech.
&gt;and track different)
&gt;
&gt;When did they change the design, in '85 or '86?????
&gt;
&gt;I'm guessing these are the intervals, please correct me if I'm wrong:
&gt;
&gt;'80-'82?
&gt;'83-'85?
&gt;'86-'91?
&gt;
&gt;Is the above correct?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance,
