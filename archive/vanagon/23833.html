Subject: RE: heater blower motor


&gt;When I bought my 79, the blower motor wasn't working.  I suffered through
&gt;the cold.  A few days ago I was poking around and found that the 16 amp
&gt;fuse had blown.  Replaced it and started it up: GREAT.  Than 10 secs
&gt;later it had a high pitch wine, and then quit:  it had blown the replaced
&gt;fuse.  So I put in another fuse.  Runs for about a minute, then blows the
&gt;fuse.   Any ideas on this?


The fan in the blower might be rubbing against the housing, fixable
by opening it up and removing the jawbreaker your kid dropped in to
bend the blades, and then bending them back.

And/or the blower bearings might be worn or rusty? This could make
its own whine, and also let the blower fan move sideways enough to
touch the housing... Uh oh. Not sure how to fix this. Replace the
bearings, obviously, 'cept I'm not sure they're replaceable. Contact
a specialized shop that works on VWs, and they can probably recommend
somebody in your area.

Is this a gas heater? Or a simple squirrel-cage blower? For a gas heater,
there's a guy in Colorado, between Denver and Co Springs I believe,
who repairs/rebuilds them professionally. He advertises in Hot VWs,
in the little picture ads near the back. JB's Heater Service,
303-660-9032.

JC Whitney, I believe, still sells the squirrel cage blowers. Part
number 54BT1272R, page 194 in Catalog 579J (with the ugly green cover),
for $75. You can probably get used ones, too, from VW houses and
junkyards-- may be more economical than having one fixed. 312-431-6102.

Good Luck!
