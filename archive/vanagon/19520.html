Subject: July Baja weekender

This talk about Baja makes me want to go back down, only sooner than 
October.  If anyone is interested, I plan to go down on the weekend of 
July 15.  Would like to make it a three-day weekend.  Don't know where 
I'll go yet but plan on going about 4 hours into Baja.  If anyone is 
interested, this should give ya plenty of time to plan for it.  E-mail me 
with any suggestions as to where to go, etc. and we'll have a blast.
