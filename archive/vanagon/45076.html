Subject: OK....Brakes and an 85

I've come to the conclusion that the best way to save money with this van is 
do everything myself.  I have been somewhat hesitant since I have never 
done major work on any kind of car, except for replacing bulbs, oil 
changes and an alternator adjustment.

My baby now needs to have some brake work done and I need some 
assistantce.  Can anybody give me a cyber-hand?  Thanx

Nate El Great
