&gt; To extend this tanget just one more bit - 
&gt; 
&gt; USAF KC135 tankers used water injection on take-off to boost thurst.  The
&gt; injected water increases the mass flow of the engine and hence the thrust. 
&gt; One caution, if you are riding in the a/c and don't know about the water
&gt; injection, it runs out shortly after lift off and the sudden and significant
&gt; drop in sound would make you think that the engines (all 4) just quit!
