Subject: Re: What to do about hubcaps
Date: Sun, 10 Jul 1994 21:07:38 -0700 (PDT)

&gt; On my '84 Vanagon I have three original hubcaps and one Iacocca special...
&gt; Should I try to replace the Chrysler hubcap with an original? 

I dunno... I been runnin' 4 Chrysler caps for 10 years.  Hubcaps are 
strictly ornament, if you want a restoration, of course you should 
replace.  Otherwise, when was the last time you noticed someone else's 
hubcaps?
