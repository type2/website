&gt;I just got my '84 camper out of storage and the battery keeps dying on 
&gt;me
&gt;by the next day. When I pulled the battery in the fall, I accidentally 
&gt;made
&gt;some sort of connection and sparks went flying. At that point I 
&gt;wondered if
&gt;I shorted something out. It will start for a while after I charge the
&gt;battery. Any ideas?
