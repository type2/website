Subject: Clutch Pedal &amp; Clutch cylinder rod Q

The clutch pedal has over an inch of free play, &amp; I mean free play. 
Part of that is from either an elongated hole in the top of the clutch
lever, where the clevis pin connecting the rod into the master cylinder
goes through, or in the clevis pin itself.  My question is how to access
the top of the pedal &amp; the master cylinder for inspection &amp; fix.

Bentley shows the blow up, but not the procedure -(yeah, I know, &quot;you're
a mechanic, figure it out.&quot;, or for the every chapter: &quot;locate defective
part; replace&quot;)

Seems impossible to work on the mess while it's all connected. 
Completely blind &amp; no room unless there's some way to get at it from the
front?.

Seems the cylinder needs to be removed w/the 2 mounting bolts.  Then,
remove the clutch pivot rod, drop it all and work away.  Probably also
have to remove the fluid feed line from the reservoir and drop the
normal amount of fluid all over the place.

Any advice will be greatly appreciated.  I'm really not looking forward
to this job.  But, I'm not looking forward to losing the clutch, either.
