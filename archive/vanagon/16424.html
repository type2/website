&gt; Firstly, my power steering on my '87 westy is working again.  All I did was
&gt; accept the offer from T. Smith for the pages on the power steering from
&gt; Bently.  The day the pages arrived the power steering started to work
&gt; properly again !  Go figure.  So far I presume there was some blockage at
&gt; the relief valve which is in the pump or the valve was stuck open.

&gt; 
Might be a good idea to change the power steering fluid filter in the
resivoir as a precaution against further problems, filter is under $10,
pump is over $200.
