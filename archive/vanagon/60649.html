Subject: Tires

     All this talk about tires got me interested in mine.  Is there a FAQ 
     or something that explains tires in general?  I got a partial answer 
     off the Goodyear Web site, but it didn't get into too much detail 
     about the load rating (two digit number).
     
     TIA
