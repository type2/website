I believe you can use up to 88 mm pistons on a stock case without 
machining. I forget the dimensions, I know the 87 mm slipins give you a 
1641 cc engine.

Buy John Muirs book. Now. There is also a book called &quot;How to Hot-Rod a 
VW engine&quot; or some such thing. Others on the list are so together they 
can probably supply you the ISBN number...
