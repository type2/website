Subject: My Van Idles Too Dern Fast


There you have it. My Van Idles Too Dern Fast.  To refresh my
memory, its a fuel rejected two liter.  It will idle slower if
I do something with the timing, but then my mileage goes south,
and I lose some peppiness.  I am actually considering paying
someone actual money to look at it :( 
 
Two words to avoid fuel spills (and brake line drips)
Vice Grips.  Carefully adjust them until the tension is
perfect.
 
Anywhay- ideas on the runaway train?  Checked my auxillary air,
the idle screw is _all_ the way in, throttle cable slack, etc etc.
Air Leaks?  How would I find these? 

My neighbors anxiously await an answer....
