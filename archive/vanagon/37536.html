Subject: Wasserboxer leaky heads - VWoA comes through!

Hi everybody - 

A few weeks ago, you might remember I posted the sad story of finding out
that one of the head gaskets on my '91 Vanagon was leaking coolant after
only 60k miles. After talking with the service advisor at the dealer, I
wrote him a letter summarizing the by-the-book-and-then-some care I have
taken on my Vanagon and asked to meet with him and the regional VWoA rep.

Last night I got a call from the service advisor. He had met with the VWoA
rep earlier in the week and told me that VWoA agreed to cover 100 percent
of the repairs! This includes fixing the leaky side and the non-leaky side
as well. The parts are on order and in a week or so, I'll be able to get
the work done soon.

I wanted to extend a *BIG* thank you to the list for alerting me to the
frequency of head gasket problems on wasserboxers, the FTC arbitration
program, and the advice I've gotten from many of you individually. I feel
like I really did my homework on this one, and it paid off. I'll let you
know how it goes after the work is done.

Sincerely,
Scott
'91 Vanagon Westfalia Camper
