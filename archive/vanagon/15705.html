&quot;will you become
a Bus Bikini Babe...albeit one in flannel.....?&quot;

Well, Ric, after the dramatic failure of my shower attempt at Red Rock,
I'm back to the drawing board.  I've decided to wear flannel pants
and shirts, and to take showers WHILE wearing them, thereby killing
two birds with one stone.  If I can clean ME *and* the clothes at the
same time, I won't need to come up with space for the washer and dryer.

Or worry about where to store a bikini.  There are only so many essentials
you can fit in one of these cars, and the bathing suit was simply taking
up too much space to be practical!
