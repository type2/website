&gt; are vintage PREverts into earlier vws than the vintage perverts?

The &quot;can I call 'em 'Preverts?'&quot; phrase came from &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;. I was
curious if anyone would notice... I wonder if POSTverts would include those
people interested in what changes are in store for EVs? 8^)

&gt; ...and have you seen those buses with plexiglas engine lids?

Yes.  Gee whiz!  But then, I always wanted to enter my truck in a show,
bring jack stands and mirrors and set it up so everybody could see all the
rusted and bent frame members, caked on mud (that's been there for 30
years, as far as I can tell), and spider webs.  None of them chromed 8^)
