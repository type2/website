&gt; Hey Guys and Gals,
&gt; 
&gt; I am trying to soak up any info possible from this list since I got my 
&gt; 1974 West about a month ago. I am rebuilding the engine for a trip to 
&gt; California this summer(from Florida). I would like to know if I should 
&gt; put on an external oil cooler. I have heard you don't need one if you 
&gt; have a doghouse oil cooler. My engine is a 1974 2000cc, do I have a 
&gt; doghouse oil cooler? Any help appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;

          Yes If the engine is stock you have a dog house oil 
cooler,locate rigth behind the fan in the left side. In some types you
may have to drop the engine in order to see it. I dont Know if you still
have to have it( I supouse no) If you install a external cooler...
