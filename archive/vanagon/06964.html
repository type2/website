&gt; As far as I can tell, they have many more than 4 campers.  They sell one or
&gt; two every week in the AutoTrader and in the backgound of the pic. you can
&gt; see a whole fleet of VW campers.
&gt; 
&gt; It scares me that they sell them though - if they still worked, wouldn't
&gt; they keep them for their fleet?
&gt; 
True enough... I have to wonder a bit about taking a 2000 mile trip in a
strange Vanagon, especially a fuel-injected or even water-cooled beast. 
I have an old split-window, and those new-fangled engines are a bit
much. Anyway, I got their flyer yesterday, and will discuss it with my
parents over Thanksgiving. Are the ones they sell in good condition, or
are they pretty ragged? 
anyway, thanks, and Happy Thanksgiving
&gt;Richard
