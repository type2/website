&gt; &gt;slang for the latest generation of bus.  Good one, Wizzer!
&gt; so we have to come up with a phrase/word/nickname that is DESCRIPTIVE of the
&gt; van, relates to its shape. what does it remind you of when you see it? that
&gt; sort of name.
&gt; 
&gt; so what does a Eurovan look like?  well, it ain't a loaf of bread. it ain't
&gt; a brick. it's rounded, tall, and has a short nose. hmmmmm. i'm not getting
&gt; any ideas here. anybody else?
&gt; 

It looks like an Astro Van.   Boy am I gonna get chewed out for this 
one by Mr. Defender.  :)

Ever since I first heard of them I've affectionally referred to them as 
urinevans... I say aye.  and Aye says I.  

I have seen one (At a show) with the license plate
        MY OVAN

I thought that was cute.    =)
As for what they look like... We could call them pathetic american 
minivans, but that wouldn't be fair.  Just 'cause they don't look VW 
doesn't mean they don't act VW.

To paraphrase Forrest Gump.  Life is like a box of chocolates.  Jesus (at 
least) got one from relatives for Christmas.
