Subject: Any busses for sale in Austin?
Date: Sat, 9 Sep 1995 10:29:57 -0500 (CDT)

Hi all!  I'm going to be in Austin briefly this Sunday
and wanted to see if someone could post the
busses/campers from this weekend's American Statesman.
Hopefully I'll be able to give a couple of them a look.

Thanks.
