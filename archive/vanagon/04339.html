Subject:      VW TOYS...

Ok, there must be some toy folks here. I just picked up a 1982 or 1982
HOTWHEELS &quot;Sunagon&quot;. Was there really anything like this issued by VW? The top
comes off to show a pretty different setup of the interior. Kinda neat
actually. Also, is anyone snatching up Johnny Lightning Bug Bombs? Wanna
trade? Anyone have a list of VW toy stuff (mfr, date, model, etc)?
