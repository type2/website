Subject: FS: '67 Westy, eastern PA

Saw this bus parked at a private Porsche garage with a for sale sign. 
It's a grass green '67 camper with nice interior.  Straight-up type 
pop-top, engine allegedly recently rebuilt, but needs drive pulley 
seal, runs.  Some rust, but not much.  Paint is a bit oxidized, but 
doesn't look too bad.

The shop is not selling it; they just have it parked there for the 
owner.  They're asking $3500.  

Keith 610-433-8733 (don't call me!)

If you make arrangements, I might be conned into test driving it.  
Also, I can take a Polaroid and scan it if the buyer is serious.
