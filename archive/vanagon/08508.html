Yo Dudes, thanks to Patrick Tower my memory has been jogged, Pizzadelic
has been changed to Pizza Go Go. It is more take out but has room to sit
in booths with a juke box. It is right on University Ave (335 U ave.).
The other pizza place is Stanford Pub and Pizza and Grill (445 Emerson
St. Palo Alto). Stuft is at 191 Castro St. Mountain View. There is a whole
slew of restaurants on Castro - Indian, Chinese etc..... --
