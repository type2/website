To All:

Drilling a SMALL hole in glass can be a bit tricky (amateur astronomers drill
large holes in glass all the time).

Try using a piece of hard brass tubing for your 'drill'.  (Inquire at a hobby
supply store; they carry an assortment of sizes.)  Using modeling clay, build
a volcano-looking dam around the drill site, sloped according to the angle of
the glass you're working on.  (This won't work if the glass is in a vertical
position.)  Fill the crater of the volcano with a mixture of oil and
carborundum abrasive.  I use #80, the coarse stuff, because I've got a lot of
it. (Try valve grinding compound if you don't have raw carborundum abrasive.)
 Chuck the tubing into a low-speed drill motor.  Drill the hole.

During the drilling, raise the bit now and then to keep the carborundum in
circulation. It cuts surprisingly fast.

After drilling the hole use finer grits of abrasive and a wooden or felt hobb
to champher the edges; if you don't, they will chip.  If the hole was drilled
as a stress relief for a progressing crack you can expect the crack to stop
when it arrives at hole. (Fingers crossed, rabbit's foot in hand.)

Filling the hole with an RTV compound will prevent embarrasing questions the
next time it rains.  ('Why... yes, there DOES appear to be a hole in my
windshield!')

(I've never done a windshield but I've installed fittings on windows cut from
flat glass.)
