Subject: Re: battery tray replacement ...

I repaired the rusted out battery tray on my '72 bus once with a piece of
wood I found on the side of the road. The battery was about to fall out on
the ground and it was at a 45 degree angle when I first noticed it was in
distress. The wood never deteriorated and I drove the bus around like that
fine for another 5 years.
