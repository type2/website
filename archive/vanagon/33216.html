Subject: Re: Taking care of pop top fiberglass

Back in June of 95, Martha Rubin reported on some stuff called Kool Seal 
that she used on one of her buses. I'd be curious as to Martha's six 
month review...as well as whether she has the &quot;full sized&quot; camper top or 
the smaller one.

I copied Martha's post below yours (pulled from archives at:

gopher://halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:70/11/Miscellaneous/Vanagon

after searching on &quot;pop top paint&quot;

Thanks! Joe

&gt; Harry, Mark, all - My fiberglass top is not coated, (not counting the corner

&gt;  I want to paint/coat it.  The durned *itchy* fiberglass gets all over me
&gt; when I scrub the top, as I do each spring, because MOLD grows in the hairline
&gt; crevices in the fiberglass, making the top look older and rattier than it
&gt; really is! I want something that'll make a nice smoothe coat and last
&gt; *forever*, not necessarily white either.. we're painting the Pumpkin this
&gt; spring and I may want to co-ordianate w/the paint job.  What have others used
&gt; on their fiberglass?
