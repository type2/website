&gt;He said he filled it up until the pump shut off.  Put in $.30 more gas
&gt;to round it off, and went to pay for the gas.  When he got back to the
&gt;bus, he noticed a puddle of gas on the ground, and could see some gas
&gt;dripping behind him as he drove away.

it could be a couple of things. i had this 'problem' when the local dealer
'fixed' my 1986 fuel tank on a recall!! they had 'forgotten' to re-install
the fuel gauge sender gasket. only, the gas didn't just leak out ... it
kinda poured out.

i'd bet on a loose hose along the little vent tubes on top of the tank.
you can put gas into the filler neck and the level will be higher than
the top of the tank ... and if one of those little vent tube hoses is
disconnected or loose, you'll get gas running out of the tank. i think
Matthew has the same problem on his diesel (but for rust-hole reasons).
