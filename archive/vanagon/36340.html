&gt;Thanks for all the replies to my prvious post about the switch. The parts 
&gt;guy suggested that I only run on speeds 1 &amp; 2. Well that's all well and 
&gt;fine until the freezing morning commute. Maybe I'll just hardwire a crowbar 
&gt;switch in for that nice form fits function look!

Actualy, in very cold weather, the van will heat faster with the fan on speed
2.  All heated air is from outside.  Bringing it in faster causes it to not
get heated as much.  Except ofr defrosting and when stuck in traffic, I
hardle use thr front fan.  The rear heater recircualtes air from inside the
van,  it works great to take off that morning chill.
