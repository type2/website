Have you tried restarting it? First thing: check the oil level and try to
determine where the oil came from; it may have lost  its oil filler cap -
hence the whooping sound or its crankcase breather pipe - Second check and
make sure all electrical and related wiring is where it should be - check
for any frayed or broken connections including the leads to the four spark
plugs and especially to the generator - Third - double check the tightness of
the fan belt. Fourth - see if your battery fluid level is ok and make sure
the wires to and from the battery and regulator are solid.
(This is where the manual comes in handy - it may take a few days to
figure out where everything is).

 You did not say whether you drove it home - if it is at
home - try starting it - does the noise persist- does the light stay on?
If so keep us posted and check Muir's writeup on &quot;Light stays on&quot;.

Good luck - DC
