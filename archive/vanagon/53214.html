Hey Guys,

I go to Chicago from Philly this Monday, my route will be basically rt
76 to rt 80.  I think I'm ready, got my snow chains, 12v air compressor,
blankets, water, flares, tools, etc.

I plan on spending a night between Cleveland and Toledo, could somebody
from around these parts recommend a cheap motel right off of Rt 80?  I
will be traveling with girlfriend and dog (50lb).

Also, I'll be on my CB on ch 19 checking for smokey and traffic.  If you
see me and my &quot;dog terd brown&quot; (as one trucker put it) 86 GL, say hi.
