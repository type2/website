Subject: da engine werks !

     
     
     I got my long block working over the weekend !  Thanks for all the 
     responses and tips from the group.  The culprit turned out to be the 
     Temp. Sensor II.  The manual says it should have some resistance that 
     drops as it heats up.  The part was bad and has infinate resistance !
     
     So I clip leaded it to ground and though the motor runs a tad rough it 
     is much better than before and I can actually drive around. 
     
     There are a few more noises than before - the only one that I wonder 
     about sounds like the tynes of the clutch plate rubbing when 
     decelrating in gear.  Is there a way to adjust this ?  Seems I recall 
     not - .  I replaced the clutch disk, plate and throwout bearing when 
     replacing the motor.  was there something that I should have adjusted 
     in there ?
     
     hope everyone has a great week, mine's started out good ...
     
     john
