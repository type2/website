Subject: carrying canoe on camper top

Does anyone have any experience carrying a canoe on a Wesfalia camper?  Is
it best to use the foam pads that fit on the sides of the canoe and rest
these directly on the fiberglass top, or is it better to use a rack? 
Anybody recommend a particular rack and how to mount it?  Thanks in
advance.

Bill Dummitt
