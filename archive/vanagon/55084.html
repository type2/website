&gt;What are the diffrences between a US and german camper eurovan.
&gt;
&gt;The dealer told me that the german on is shorter but by how much?
&gt;Do the fridges work differently?  One propane.

Based on my side-to-side comparison in the Yukon, I'd go with the German
(Westfalia) conversion.  The BIG advantage is that the Westie propane
valves are mounted into the side of the body, so they don't snag on roots,
etc.  (By the end of the trip, the propane connections on my vehicle were a
MESS!)
