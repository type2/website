Subject: syncro tranny fluid capacity


Dear Listees,

I've decided to go with Redline synthetic tranmission fluid in my 87's 
gearbox and front differential.  I will have to order it from Redline, as 
they do not have a retailer in Alaska.

How many quarts will it take to do the job?

Is it useful to try to pump out whatever won't drain, or to elevate the 
side opposite the drain plug?

Thanks to the Archive and Mark McCulley for advice on this job so far.  
If anyone feels strongly that a more widely available brand (Mobil1, 
Castrol, Amsoil) will do just as good a job, please share your opinion 
with me.

Cheers,

Chris Wyatt
Fairbanks, Alaska
