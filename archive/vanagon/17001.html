Subject: Re: FOLLOWUP: Squeaky/Creaky Vanagon Suspension

&gt;back to the mechanic and we determined that the sound was coming from the
&gt;control arm bushings and bolts. It will cost me $450 to have the mechanic
&gt;replace all of these items - so he suggested I decide if the squeaking
&gt;bothered me that much - or - try some silicon spray on the bushings.
&gt;
&gt;Ive sprayed the hell out of the bushings with my van sitting normally,

I tried tons of white grease spray, to no real avail. $450? I'll crank the 
tunes up! I tried to work in the grease getting the front end airborne on 
logging road bumps, no effect. Bottomed out enough too. Maybe I'll try some 
silicone. The procedure for changing bushings doesn't look like fun, 
especially when nothing else is needed, maybe when my shocks go I'll do it.
