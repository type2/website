Randy--CHANGE MECHANICS

The O2 sensor has little effect UNTIL the engine's warm.  Get it changed
and change your mechanic while you're at it.  Whatever he 'adjusted'
probably needs to be readjusted.  And the O2 sensor WILL affect your
mileage.  You can probably find a post from me in the archives
explaining how, but you can replace the O2 sensor with a generic and
save about $80.  You'll have to cut and splice, if you can't find the
information in the archives, let me know.

&gt; &gt; Does anyone know where I could pick up a second hand service manual that
&gt; &gt; covers a 86 Vanagon GL? I am also looking for any suggestions that anyone
&gt; &gt; might have to increase my gas mileage. I have already put new plugs, wires,
&gt; &gt; cap, rotor, fuel filter, and had the fuel system set. The mechanic said
&gt; &gt; that my OXS sensor is not functioning, but also said that this won't have a
&gt; &gt; whole lot of effect after the engine is warm and that he adjusted the
&gt; &gt; system to compensate so I shouldn't need to replace it. Is this true?
&gt; 
&gt; Replace your OXS, it will affect you MPG.  Check the archives about
&gt; this.
