&gt; Leo,

Didn't the post '80 engines receive a substantially revised head (square 
exhaust port; beefed up valves etc?) enough to consider them designed 
especially for the vanagons of 80-83.5? 

This was my original point. Surely the 
designers knew the engine was going to a) have a tough time with all 
that fuel injection/pollution control &quot;stuff&quot; attached to it and b) have 
even a harder time pushing around 3000 pounds of barn door.
