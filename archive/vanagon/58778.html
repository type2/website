I have an old heavy steel bumper mount bike rack I install onto the 
front bumper of my '80 to haul bikes.  I have a Westi.  I replaced 
the two front screws holding on the luggage rack with a swivel eye.  
I attach the top of the bike rack to this eye (it'll hold my weight 
plus) to supplement the bumper's flexibility.  Ends up as a fairly 
rigid rack.  Watch out for dips in the road! depending on how low the 
bikes actually hang.

&gt; Has anyone had any experience with the bumper mount bike racks?  
&gt; I see JCW sells them for around $38.
