Subject: Re: Sliding door on '90 popping open

This happens in my 91 Carat too...Its real scarry when my 4 kids are
seated in the back. Sounds like a recall is in order..maybe the NTSB
should get called...I bookmarked their homepage that was posted the
other day...

PS has anyone had their accelerator pedel lever rod wear out causing
pedel to hit th floor and never come back up? Mine did...it was not fun.

&gt; For the last two mornings on the way to work, the sliding door on my '90
&gt; Camper has popped open.  In the past I've had a little trouble closing
&gt; it--if you don't give it just the right &quot;touch&quot; when you close it, the
&gt; back end doesn't seem to engage.  A little oil on the latch has alway
&gt; seemed to cure that, tho.  Its not popping open all the way, just the
&gt; back end pops out.  This morning I heard a faint &quot;thunk&quot; and then air
&gt; noise, and when I stopped at the office it was slightly open back
&gt; there.  Any suggestions on what to adjust, replace, etc.?
&gt; 
&gt; TIA,
