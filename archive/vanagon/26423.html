Subject: WTB Vanagon 2wd manual

	Lost my '86 vanagon to Opal and a large pine tree last week.  

Am looking for a '89-'91 2wd Vanagon with manual tranny.  Prefer some 
where in the southeast.  I'm located in Auburn, AL (2.5 hrs drive sw from 
Atlanta, GA)

e-mail spotts_at_freenet.fsu_dot_edu or post to vanagon list.

p.s. Had recent dealings with Jim Ellis VW in Atl.  Parts Dept. (Joe 
Basile) gets my vote for extremely good customer service.
