Subject: What is a 1965 Westy worth?
Date: Wed, 11 Oct 95 10:01:00 EDT


Greetings,

although it is woefully underpowered, hopeless at stopping, etc etc, I have 
found an old 1965 Vanagon that I've fallen in love with. Although a 
low-miler, the body is rough in all the common places (no gaping holes, but 
rough enough). The interior is fair, and most things seem to run ok. I know 
one can never put a price on something without seeing it, but I have NO IDEA 
how much this beast is worth. Can someone familiar with early buses one give 
me an approximate price range for what this '65 westy in fair (but needs 
lots of work) condition is worth?
