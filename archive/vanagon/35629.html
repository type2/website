Subject: Re: Crashworthiness of Bug Vans


&gt;
&gt;I've often wondered about crash worthiness of  my van.
&gt;I also wondered if 20 year old seat belts are any stronger than wet
&gt;lazagna noodles.
&gt;

&gt;Anybody have other opinions, or data?
&gt;

About 25 years ago, a couple of Penn State engineering students went out to
local junk yards and collected seat belts for an age vs strength study. As
I recall, belts with 20 years of UV/ moisture exposure has only 10 percent
of their as-new strength. These were GM issue nylon belts I believe.

Ve awl Kno Chermin Belts are supeerior, Ya? ...Hogaaaaan!

As a general rule one could prolly argue: If your seat upholstery is
crispy, so are your belts.

I advocate growing a big (ger) beer gut for extra padding - safety first!
