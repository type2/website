Subject: engine conversions

Has anyone considered mounting the radiator for these engine conversions on
the under side of the bus?  Our AC has a radiator lookin' type of thing down
there with two blowers on top of it and this seems like it would be an ideal
place.

P.S.  Is there an average price for one of the V6 or electric conversions?
        and has anyone done this to a late model bus(''72-''79)?
