Subject: Re: Door hinges

Dave,

The screws fastening the door hinges are normally removed with an impact
driver.  Be persistant, use lots of Liquid Wrench and take several days for
the task if necessary.  When reinstalling the hinges,  chase the threads with
a tap -- the impact will have distorted them.  New screws are available from
most well-stocked FLAPS and some VW dealers.  If you can't find them locally,
give a shout via the list or check the archives, we've had this problem in
the past in some areas of the country and have always managed to resolve it.
 The screw-plate is free inside of the door pillar on some models and
positioning it can be a bear, but it is a do-able thing, as the archives
show.

Once the door is off the vehicle you have the perfect opportunity to rebuild
the hinge pins.  The best fix is to have them bushed and to replace the
carbon steel pin with one of stainless steel.  It is usually hinge-pin wear
that causes the misalignment  you've noticed even on show cars, since
adjusting the position of the hinges effects only the x-y relationship.  Worn
hinge-pins make it impossible to align a door without shimming -- and
shimming doesn't speak to the root problem.  One of the VW-specific magazines
has a pictorial how-to on hinge-pin replacement.

The inexpensive hinges used on Volkswagens, and the way they are exposed to
the weather, dictates the need for frequent lubrication.  Back in the good
old days when there was a VW dealer on every corner and service was
inexpensive, each time the dealer gave you a lube job he also lubricated from
12 to 27 other points on the vehicle, depending on type.  Door hinges were at
the top of the list.  The drive-thru lube-bays that have sprang up in recent
years do not provide the quality of service needed to maintain a Volkswagen,
leaving the task up to you.  Unfortunately,  I've met VW owners that didn't
even know it was a good idea to oil their hinges, and had never done so for
as much as ten years.  Little wonder we see a lot of sagging doors.
