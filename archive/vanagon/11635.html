Subject: Re: Early Single Cab In CA Wreckyard!

&gt;	Anyway, the rear gate is pretty thrashed, but the left and right 
&gt;side gates look like they just need some smoothing and painting. The 
&gt;original speedo was also still in it, although the rest of the cab was 
&gt;pretty thrashed. The engine is a late dual-port 1600, but I don't know 
&gt;if there are other rare bits in the suspension, underbody, etc.
&gt;
&gt;	 The truck is at Pick-'n-Pull, on Monterey Road just south of 
&gt;Alma street in San Jose, CA. It's way in the back, with the other VW 
&gt;buses and American-made vans.I didn't have time, but somebody should 
&gt;save these rare Type 2 bits from the crusher! 	
&gt;
Ian,

I moved from San Jose in August of 93.  I remember that single cab being 
there back in at least the summer of 93.  I cannot believe it is still 
there.  I asked them (Pick-N-Pull) how much they wanted for the whole thing 
back then and they said like a thousand $.  It would be nice, but not that nice.

John
