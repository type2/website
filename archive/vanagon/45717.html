Subject: Re: Do dealers know how to work on EVs

Hello Chris:

I am an EV Winnebago owner in Toronto.  While I won't 
comment on all VW dealerships in the area, I have been 
trekking back and forth to OWASCO in Whitby (50 km each way) 
for service and warranty.

I often took my 1988 Westy to Don Valley VW (5 minutes away) 
but I have been reluctant to take the EV there.  (No 
criticism - it's an excellent service department).  I find 
that using a dealership that does a high volume of camper 
business (sales and rentals) pays off.

Of course, it means taking a day off work from time to time 
&lt;grin&gt;.  Just throw a bike in the back and explore the roads 
up to Port Perry while the wrenches work on the camper!
