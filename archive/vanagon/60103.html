Subject: Silver box under dashboard 88 Vanagon - what is it?
Date: Fri, 16 May 1997 22:18:53 -0400

When adjusting the glove compartment hinge mount, I noticed that there is a
shiny aluminum box with electrical wires and German writing on it about the
size of two cigarette packs behind the glove box.  Just curious - what is
it?

Second question.  Discovered a new coolant leak today!  at least this one
will be easy to fix.  It's coming from the small plastic tube that runs
around the left side of the engine opening and empties into the expansion
tank with an assortment of connections to it at various places.  My leak
was just over the expansion tank so it will be easy to patch.  I check with
VW and this big U shaped tube is all one piece and costs about $77 and they
have never had one in their inventory.  Part of mine has already been patch
by the PO with a larger piece of tubing and 4 circle clamps it seems to be
holding fine (a lot less than $77 worth of material)

After all this, my second question is... What is the purpose of this line
and all the connections to it?  My best guess is that it's just some sort
of collector to perhaps let trapped air in the various parts of the engine,
etc. get back to the expansion tank.  Am I 'warm'?  Anybody know?  Neither
the parts guy or the Service Advisor at VW could tell me...

TIA
