&gt;I want to rig my camper so that when the red oil pressure light 
&gt;illuminates on the dash, the opened(while the keys are in the 
&gt;ignition)  door buzer will come on.  THis way I will never, hopefully 
&gt;, drive any distance with the oil light on.  Has anyone ever tried to 
&gt;do this, or know how it can be done?

Buy another door buzzer and wire directly to warning light.  You could also
use a 12 volt &quot;Beeper&quot; to give a different and noticeable sound.  Available
at Radio Shack for a few bucks.
