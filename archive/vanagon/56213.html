Subject: Re: lowest mileage

     I don't know if having a 15 year old van that you have only driven 
     2266 miles a year is worthy of a pat on the back.  j-)
     
     Seems to me you've been wasting a perfectly good source of enjoyment 
     by having it parked too much.  %-)
     
     But, then I've put that many miles on my '87 westy in the last year, 
     what do I know.   /-}
     
     Have a nice day and sell your van to someone who'll use it!

How about a pat on the back for the lower mileage Westy.  We have to figure on 
some factor so as equate mileage to year.
     
Here's my entry '82 Westy (diesel) 34K (pristine)
