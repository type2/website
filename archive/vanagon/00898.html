Subject: Good VW yard in Seattle Area

All you Northwestern bus-heads should be sure and check out the following
yard if you haven't already:

Alseth Auto Parts
618 105th St. S.W.
Everett, WA 98204

206/353-3303

The place is worth a visit just for its recreational value.  It's a double
lot of (almost all air-cooled) VW's stucked 3 deep in the mud, a metal storage
container serves as their office, and the place is nestled into a solidly
middle class neighborhood with neatly trimmed lawns and the whole 9 yards.

The folks there appear to be VW resto &amp; racing heads running a business to
support their habit.  Very friendly, knowledgeable.  No hint of the slimey
business creeps that often lurk in junk yards trying to charge you as much
as they can.

Be sure and call first for explicit directions, I get lost every time.

Cheers, Tim Burnett
