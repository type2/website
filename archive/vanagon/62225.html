Subject: RE: Rack am Ruined

When I replaced the Rack on my '87 it came with severe warnings that if the 
old one failed due to metal filings &amp; junk from a bad pump that the warranty 
would be void if you didn't replace the pump. It also stressed the need to 
purge the system and replace the filter in the P/S resevoir.

Even so, I doubt if the new rack would fail in two weeks even with crud in the 
system - I'd bet you had damaged seals or mating surfaces in the rack when you 
got it. TFE seal rings are not at all forgiving about damage.

I got my rebuilt rack last year through Austin Vee Dub - with the rebuilder 
they used (don't know who) it cost about $400 + core. So far the new one has 
been great.

&gt;Hello;   After replacing the rack and pinion in my 87 G, two weeks ago, I
&gt;have been losing  ATF from the p/s reservoir at a rate of about a cup a day.
&gt;I parked the van over a sheet of cardboard overnight and found that the leak
&gt;was from both ends of the rack where the rubber bellows slip over the
&gt;housing.  Did I get a bum rack and pinion? or could some debris in the
&gt;system, which I didn't flush, take out the new seals.  Has anyone else had
&gt;this problem?  This is the rack that cost me $1000. hadn't even lasted one
&gt;month.  No other symptoms to report,  Dexron oil ATF Castrol no rude noises,
&gt;no excessive heat or any thing else  Puzzled  Larry Carter
