Subject: Re: oxy sensors $$$$

after embarking on a three week road trip I have developed this problem 
with my van that I can't seem to fix, no matter how much $$$ i drop into 
that thing. I have regained access to my e-mail account for about three 
days so I thought I'd hit my faorite vw owners up for some ideas as to 
what my problem may be, here is the lowdown.  The van is driven for about 
45 minutes and the red water temp warning light goes on and the 
acclerator starts to get weak and after enough time it eventually wilkl 
lose all power and have to be turned off for about two minutes before the 
whole process repeats itself, excluding the 45 minutes of worry-free 
driving in the begining.
went to see mechanic(Independent Bug Werks, Corvallis, OR)
mechanic said maybe its the oxy-sensor
disconnects oxy sensor
still having problems with water-temp light, but no acceleration problems 
at all
i decide the 130 bucks for the sensor is resonable if my car will keep 
running well
mechanic installs new sensor
car runs same as before the $130 and the $15 for a pressure cap for the 
coolant tank
arrrrragh!
whats the deal!
obviously the oxy sensor is working and it is detecting something in the 
engine compartment that is making it weaken the flow to the accelerator, 
but what?
please, any ideas would be greatly appriciated
this mechanic doesn't seem to have a clue what it is
thanks in advance

ps- it seems like the car is using too much coolant too......
