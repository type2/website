&gt; Hello-
&gt;
&gt; I've been to Vanagon_dot_com and read the info on adding an extra battery
&gt; to my
&gt; 83.5 Westfalia. Thanks for that. But I have a few questions.
&gt;
&gt; My auto electric guy was a little leary about adding a battery. He
&gt; said the
&gt; alternator's life would be dramatically shortened by having to charge
&gt; an
&gt; additional battery. Especially if that battery is often completely
&gt; discharged. He also said the deep cycle wheel chair batteries were way
&gt;
&gt; expensive and heavy and I should go with a boat battery.
&gt; TIA

I have a problem with these statements.  I have run a deep discharge
auxiliary battery in my van for 14 years.  I still have the original
alternator with no problems (now I have said that it will probably blow
up).  The inrush into a discharged deep discharge (try saying that three
times fast) battery is not very high.  I use an isolation switch to
prevent discharging my primary battery when stopped, and connect it when
the engine in running.  I have a diesel, and when the engine starts the
alternator regulator does not cut in until I put a few revs on the
engine.  If I was concerned about throwing a sudden load on the
alternator I could cut it in then, but I don't bother.  I have the
auxiliary battery fused with a 50 amp fuse to the main battery.  I have
never blown a fuse, so the inrush is less than 50 amps.  I think all
alternators are rated at at least 50 amps.

BTW I switch the ground connection of my auxiliary battery, and leave
the positive side always connected.
