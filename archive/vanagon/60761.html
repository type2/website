&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;  Believe me there is a
&gt;&gt;&gt; market for vanagon (and EV) weekenders. &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have to agree with this, to many a full on Westy is too much to use as a
&gt;&gt;&gt;daily driver while the weekender is a good comprise...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'm a little new at this, so forgive my ignorance.  Weekender is the fold
&gt;&gt;down rear seat, right?  When we replaced our faithful '73 w/ homemade
&gt;&gt;camper conversion back in '92, my wife refused to buy a used synco, which I
&gt;&gt;really wanted, because the back seat didn't fold down.  Instead, we bought
&gt;&gt;a '91 2WD, which had the fold down seat.  SHE WAS RIGHT.  Wouldn't do
&gt;&gt;without it.  On long trips, we can drive until we get tired, pull over and
&gt;&gt;sleep until the sun, (or a passing freight train) wakes us,  and continue
&gt;&gt;on our way, refreshed.  But I can still haul 4x8 sheets of plywod, etc., or
&gt;&gt;12' lumber.  A great compromise.  It's one of the many things about the
&gt;&gt;vanagon that amazes minvan owners.
&gt;&gt;my 0.02,

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I agree, and thanks to the moral support of you other weekender owners,
&gt;I've made the commitment to hang on to it. If it needs heads, so be it. If
&gt;it gets bad enough, its the Subaru engine! (In BC, it'll be GREAT!)

I have a line of thought I use in situations like this:
New heads, $2000.  Would I pay $2000 to buy this vehicle if it had new heads?

I was considering getting rid of my Vanagon over new heads, and went
shopping around.  The closest thng I could find to a replacement (new) was
a Ford Club Wagon.  Dealer wanted $25K, and would give me $6K for the
Vanagon.  So, did I want to pay $19K for something close to what I wanted,
or $2K fopr what I already knew was what I wanted.

Subaru swap sounds like fun, though.  MAybe once I get my '83 on the road
I'll give that a try.
