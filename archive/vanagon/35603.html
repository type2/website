Subject: Abbotsford Killer Drives a VW?

I was listening to the radio this morning and they said the Abbotsford Killer 
drives a VW van.

For those of you who don't have the good fortune to live near Vancouver....
The Abbotsford Killer is a man who started his fame (as sick as it is) in 
Abbotsford (East of Vancouver).  He is a fairly twisted individual who has 
contacted news departments at local TV stations and has called the RCMP to taunt 
them.

Apparently last night the grave stone of one of his victims was stolen, mutilated 
and dumped on top of a news cruiser owned by a Lower Mainland radio station.  The 
police say that the evidence points to the fact that it was the Abbotsford killer 
who did this.  They also say police are looking for a VW van seen around the 
cemetary last night.  They didn't say if it was a bus, Vanagon, EV, or anything.

So if anyone in the Vancouver area gets stopped by the RCMP today, have patience 
and understanding.  Taunting them will probably land you in a holding cell for at 
least a few hours.
