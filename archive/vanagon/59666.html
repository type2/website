Sorry if I insulted yours or anyone else's Mac, but Mac's have caused me
nothing but grief in my experience. But it's just my view, for instance,
yesterday I was talking to a FORMER VW mechanic of mine about changing the
gear box on my GL. We got to talking about the old breadloaf syncro
prototype, when he spouts out that they probably only made 2 because they
realized they were &quot;pieces of shit&quot; as he put it. Well I argued with him of
course (only because of the things that you people had said, not from
personal experience as I don't have one :( sniff,.. ) but he's entitled to
his opinion, just like everyone else. I guess that means when one goes up
for sale, it will be one less person to have to worry about buying it away
from someone who would care for it like it was their first born. (like a
list member)
