Subject: '71 Kombi camper $2500.00 What's so special?

There's an add in our local paper for a &quot;71 volkswagen camper.  I  
looked at it.  Body is very good, paint is hideous purple, interior  
so so, supposedly just overhauled engine, it's not a pop top.   
$2500.00  .  Vin #23122xxxxx.  That identifys it as a Kombi right?   
Is there some reason they fetch a higher price?

Bart
