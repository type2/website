Subject: radiator fan stays on

Hi there: After several months out of the country I'm back and, sadly,
back to Vanagon (87 Syncro) problems. This one looked easy. The radiator
cooling fan
comes on when the van is started on warm days, even when the van has
been sitting all night. I thought it would be the thermal switch.
Bentley says this is located on the upper left front of the radiator,
behind the grille. Looking there I cannot find it. The van has
airconditioning and is a Syncro, which probably complicates the issue.
Can anyone tell me where it is, or what other possible solutions to this

problem might be? Thanks muchly, Nelson Hogg
