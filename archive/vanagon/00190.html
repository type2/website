]&gt;  The first time I replaced one, the parts guy asked me
]&gt;  if it was right or left side! They appear identical,
]&gt;  so I pulled both off and held the tailgate up with my
]&gt;  head while I &quot;tested&quot; each strut to identify the
]&gt;  weaker one (at that price I didn't want to replace both
]&gt;  since the gate was just sagging slowly).

]The left and right struts are different.  The right strut has a &quot;locking&quot;
]feature in its valve mechanism.  Apparently, that is some kind of
]mechanical lock that you can defeat by pulling down on the hatch, but
]strong enough to hold the hatch up -&gt; while taking the load off the
]pressurized part of the strut.

Is there any reason not to use the locking type on both sides?  I see that
your source there in Houston only carries the locking one, which kinda im-
plies that they don't see a need to carry the other kind.  I'm 'bout due to
replace mine (the Pep Boys ones on there now only lasted a year) and would
just as soon put the same on both sides if there's no reason not to.  I
could pick up a pair at Apec the next time I'm in Houston (about four weeks
from now).  If I recall correctly from the last time I replaced these, they
looked identical, even though they were marked &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;.  I can't
recall Pep Boys' price (although I could look it up if anyone is interested
for comparison), but I sure can't recommend them.
