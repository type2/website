Thom,

I get that &quot;clutch drag&quot; problem in my FIAT when its been stood for
a week or two. I don't think it's a problem, I reckon the gearbox
oil goes real thick if you don't use it for a few days. Coz the clutch
it engaged when you start it, the gears in the tranny are turning and
&quot;dragging&quot; the final drive gears round a little. It goes away after
a few minutes or so.

I always put the clutch down when I start the FIAT to give it a little
more chance of starting.

Lee.
