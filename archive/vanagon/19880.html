&gt;&gt;I was lucky don't let this happen to you.  Several lessons learned here:
&gt;&gt;Keep a fresh fire extinguisher in your VW always.

&gt;   [making note to buy a couple jumbo boxes of baking soda and keep
&gt;    them next to the spare oil in the campmobile...]

for whatever reason, that reminded me of another embarassing moment ...
when i tried to replace the voltage regulator in my 71 bus. without
disconnecting the battery ground strap. :(

a word of advice to ALL the bus folk: DISCONNECT THE BATTERY whenever you
do anything with the generator or alternator or fuel pump!!!

anyway, i didn't, and sure enough,i dropped the voltage regulator, and sure
enough, its positive terminal hit the body and sure enough, it made a GOOOD
connection.

you guys ever seen an 8-gauge wire evaporate in front of your eyes?? that
big red/white wire that goes into the generator?? POOF!!!

and that Loud CLANGING noise ... wow, i didn't know something slamming shut
could be that loud!!

luckily, it did NOT do any damage to the regulator NOR the generator. i
replaced the wire (VERY CAREFULLY!! After Disconnecting the Battery!!!) and
it kept right on running for many years to come.
