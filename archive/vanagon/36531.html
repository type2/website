Subject: syncro probs

Hi all, I am new to the list and look forward to the additional 60 messages a 
day.

I have a 86 syncro that has a vibration problem.  If I take the driveline off 
the problem goes away.  Anyone know where I can one of things for a reasonable 
price.  Dealer price is around $500.  I live in Vancouver WA. 

The other problem that happens is you can be driving along and the van 
lurches, skips a beat.  

Dave
