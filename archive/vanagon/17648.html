For the poptopless and/or camping addicts at large - this from the June
issue of Mt. Bike (action) magazine, under &quot;Quick Releases&quot;   :

CAR TOP TENT

Now that camping season is here, it's time to roll out the ol'
sleeping bag, saddle up the troups and head for the hills!  But wait,
Felix doesn't like the dirt, Felixia doesn't like bugs and Ricky doesn't
have a camper or even a pick-up truck.  Where are we gonna sleep?
Have no fear.  Car Top Tent is here.  The Car Top Tent attaches
to a car or van roof rack.  When open, the case becomes the tent's
platform.  An aluminum ladder acts as the opening lever; the tent
opens to a 44-square foot platform with a two-inch foam platform.
The tent structure and rain fly are attached to the platform and 
are automatically erected as the uniot is opened.  The ladder
becomes the support for one side of the platform. When closed, 
the tent rides on the rack and is trim and weather-tight, 
even safe at highway speeds.  With the tent in place, one bicycle
can be carried on the roof.

The folks at Car Top Tent sat it takes less than 22 seconds to
pop the tent up and climb in.  They also say two people can easily remove or install the 69-pound tent on top of a vehicle in less than three minutes.
The whole thing can support 450 pounds and sleep two adults or four
children comfortably.  The tent has five windows and comes with an 
integrated rain fly and is made of expedition quality rip-stop
nylon.  Other features are &quot;no-see-um&quot; window netting, heavy-duty
oxford nylon floorings and corrosion-resistant aluminum.  An all-weather
nylon cover wraps around the unit when traveling.  The whole thing
is completely water-proof.  The Car Top Tent retails for $699
and has a one-year warranth.  To camp on your car, contact
Car Top Tents at 1039 W. Bridge St., Ste. 20, Phoenixville,
PA 19460, or call 1.800.227.8671 or 1.610.688.8071
