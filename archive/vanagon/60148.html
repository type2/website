&lt;&lt; This is a deal with the Twin Cities (Minneapolis/Saint Paul, Minnesota)
 Volkswagen Club and three of the four area VW dealerships.  There is also a
 10% VW Club discount with some of the area FLAPS.  So far this has saved me
 enough to pay for the membership for about the next 8 years.

When I wrote this I had not read the whole thread.  Is there a VW sponsered
VW Club?
