I would definitely check the mounts but I have had new clutches do this
for about 2k miles also. When broken in they ran fine.

&gt;&gt;Occasionaly, maybe one in twenty times, I get a vibration or shuddering
when
&gt;&gt;releasing the clutch in first gear.  It seems to happen if there is
some
&gt;&gt;stress involved such as heading up a hill from a stop.  All of the
clutch
&gt;&gt;parts are new.  The CV joints are all new.  Could this be transmission
or
&gt;&gt;motor mounts?  In my 63 beetle mounts were the problem.  What is
involved in
&gt;&gt;changing vanagon mounts?
