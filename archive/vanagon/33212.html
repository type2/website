Subject: Re: Taking care of pop top fiberglass

I have a Poptop that is getting   &quot;ratty&quot; and have tried to fix it 
with two different kinds of spray paint. For the sides I use the kind for vinyl 
tops (comes in several colors to match, the white is a close match for 
the Westy) that works well to mat the fibers down that are coming 
loose. For the very top I have used reg. $0.88 white spray paint and 
cover the gaskets with tape. This is only a quick fix since the top 
seems to revert back to its &quot;ratty&quot; look after a few months. The best 
fix might be from a professional that uses some kind of epoxy or 
resin based coating if your fibers are coming through the paint.
My other Westy's top is in good shape except for some mold in the 
creases. The vinyl paint does a nice job hiding what the soap won't 
get off.  I just touch up where it is needed.
