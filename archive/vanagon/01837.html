Subject: Engine / Advice wanted

I'm looking for a new engine for my '71 transporter, or optionally an
entire new vehicle.  My current engine has been diagnosed as having a
couple months left (something about the crankshaft moving back and forth
the way it shouldn't).  Please mail me if you can recommend a good
replacement...

If anyone knows of a good mechanic in the central Tennessee area, please
mail me, also.

        -Jim
