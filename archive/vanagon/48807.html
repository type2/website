Subject: Re: vanagon rims

&gt; I saw a Vanagon yesterday at the Eureka Springs, AR show that was using
&gt; alloys off of an Audi Quantum.

I, too, have a set of 15&quot; alloys that came with my syncro, perhaps those
are the same.  They have a six-spoke pattern.  These fit the smaller
syncro hubs as they are, but will not fit the front hubs of a 2WD Vanagon.

Mine came with 215-50/15's on them, and look reall silly -- low-rider
tires on a syncro!  I still have not bought decent, macho tires for these,
and ride on 14&quot; steels...

The part number on these is the same as the 15&quot; steel ones tsmith quoted,
only the last letter is different (but I'm not home, so I can't get it
right now).

It also appears that the 16&quot; wheels off a Porsche Carrera-4 will fit,
although these probably would cost more than the van is worth...
