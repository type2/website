Subject: Webber hookup

 Hi all. I replaced my 73 Camper's dual carbs with a Webber a while back, 
but have not quite figured a good way to attach the accel cable. The tube
comes through the sheet metal in the wrong location to attach to the
carb's linkage. Does anyone have any ideas other than chopping the tube
off the underside of the van, and having it re-welded?
Thanks,
Dan
