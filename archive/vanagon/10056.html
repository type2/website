Subject: Re: window rubber: removing those unsightly plastic thingies


&gt;it would certainly be a helluva lot cheaper than doing what i did ... which
&gt;was to buy the euro-normal/after 1989 window rubber and replacing them all.
&gt;:( &lt;well, dangit ... it SEEEMED like a good idea at the time!!

I've actually thought about this.  How difficult is it to get them back in
and how much did it set you back?
