Subject:       Re: VWs in ads; Westy Tent Trivia Time

Howdy strangers; been lurkin'.

Several have commented on the ads.  The &quot;think small&quot; b&amp;w early-60s 
stuff was done by ad agency Doyle Dane Bernbach or something equally 
alliterative, if memory serves.  There's a book on 'em.

Back in my undergrad persuasion class I did a study of VW ads in 
major magazines over the period roughly 1960-80. Cool way to do a 
semester project.   Interesting how they change to a busy, coloful, flashy-trashy style about the time 
the wasserkuhlers start showing up.  (I couldn't figure a way to do a 
dissertation on The Rhetoric of VWs or I'd have that Ph.D. today.)

Terry Schuler's book has some neat repros of some of the older 50's Reuters 
ads that always make me feel like I had some bad mushrooms because 
the people look way too small and the cars are all windswept.

Oh!  and a Westy tent Q: Larry Clark (no admissible relationship) of 
Seattle noted to me in email:

&gt;year I blundered into a near new Free Stander for sale. I don't think the tent
&gt;had ever been used as the poles were still in their shipping box. The pole bag
&gt;had never been used. Anyway, included in the setup was a white light weight
&gt;canvas afair designed to go on over the top of the tent. If you look at the poles
&gt;of this type of tent, you will notice that there are up right pegs in the upper four corners
&gt;of the poles. The rain fly has grommets which slip over these pegs. The fly itself
&gt;is quite tight and as a result helps prevent water from getting into the tent. 

Wotzis?  I coulda stayed dry in Bahia Honda?  
This thing doesn't show in any of the pix or parts diagrams 
I have, but I have a paucity of later (post 75) stuff.  First I heard 
of it -- anyone else seen it?  Mail me a .gif for the Westy Tent 
page?  Puh-leeze?
