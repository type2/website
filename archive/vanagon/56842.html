Whoa-ness, did another T4 motor sneak in here that I don't know about, or
are we talking about the I-5 motor?...

Forget the VR6 EV, forget the Land Rovers, forget the Sharans, just get your-
selves a nice cheap '93 w/ a dead motor and start hanging out at wrecking yards
waiting for one of them TDI motors to come in...   ;)
