Ok, listen up.  There are 11 &quot;maybes&quot; (none looking too firm) for
going to Baja, and 6 &quot;kinda firm&quot; responses.  Many have said
they would be willing to go either way.  A few said wait until
our esteemed leaders can hopefully rejoin the effort in the future
and plan to do it then.

I'd like the make the motion that we do put this on the back burner
until such a time when more people can make it, and when we have
some real experienced leadership to take us on the offroad tour
of a lifetime, etc.  

In the meantime, I'm still anxious to go camping that weekend, and I
know that some of you have altered your schedule to attend this
proposed trip.

It looks like half the group comes from S. Calif, and half from near
S.F.  How about if we meet for a group camp thing/orgy/explosion/whatever
somewhere in between?  The mountains?  The coast?

This is for the last weekend on October, the 27-29 if we count Friday
through Sunday.  

Let me know your thoughts..........
