&gt;  All this talk about overheating has piqued my curiostity &lt;again&gt;. Could
&gt;  someone who has both a cylinder head temp and an oil temp gauge comment on 
&gt;  the relationship between the two. When the engine gets hot, do both temps
&gt;  move up together? Is oil temperature more affected by engine speed &lt;increased
&gt;  friction&gt; than head temp? Do the heads ever get really hot but the oil stays
&gt;  closer to normal?

My experience is this.  I'll be driving along the highway, oil temp about
210, CHT about 275 (mine is measured at the boss - spark plug readings
seem to be higher for other people).  I'll see a grade coming, start up
it in 4th.   Gas pedal almost (but *never* fully!) floored, try to hold
speed at 55.  At this (relatively) slow RPM, the oil temp will remain
close to the same for a long time, while the CHT will rise very quickly
to around 325.  If I downshift and slow to 45 in 3rd, the rpms go up a lot,
and the oil temp shoots up very quickly while the CHT drops to cruising
temps (275-ish).  If I maintain high RPMs in 3rd, the oil temp will go
through the roof.  Once it hit 270 - never again.  So, I generally slow
down to 40 in 3rd to get a good balance between oil temp and CHT.  Once
the oil temp is this high, it will not go down easily, and if I try to
shift back into 4th at 50mph, the pressure is very low, like 20-25psi.
This while the oil temp is hovering around 240.  I ran (until 2 weeks 
ago) Castrol 20-50 for all of the above tests.  I ran straight 30 weight
for a while, but found that pressure dropped, and went back to 20-50.

Two weeks ago I put in 15-50 Mobil One synthetic.  I haven't been on
any long drives yet, but yesterday driving up a grade I got the temp
up to 230.  From what I can tell, the oil temp hasn't changed much, but
pressure seems to be up a little at high temps.  Not a lot, but even
at 230 degrees I still had 40psi _at_ 60 mph, which I consider to be
good pressure.  I think I will stick with the 15-50 synthetic, since
(fortunately) my bus doesn't use any oil.

&gt;  And finally, what temperature do people call &quot;overheating&quot;? Oil temp at 250
&gt;  degrees? Heads at 400 degrees? 

My VW performance book states that ideally oil temp should be between
180 and 230, and never exceed 270.  Don't know about CHT.
