Andrew:

I notice the same thing on my '97 - apparently related to the ASB - but it
shouldn't be there. The ASB functions when it senses a difference in wheel
speed, and rapidly pulses the brake pressure to even things out and keep a
wheel from skidding.  I'd guess the sensors are not functioning just right -
sensing a difference in rotation that isn't there. (I notice it most in very
LIGHT braking; while ASB should only kick in with hard stops.)

My '93 EV also has ASB and did not have this symptom.
