Subject: Re: Wannabus to Gottabus:  How To

I think we kind of have that already, in some informal capacity, but I'll
be happy to offer my limited knowledge up for anyone near AR who needs some
foolish advice...goodness knows I should have had someone warn me about the
eminent problems with the '71. Once it's in the yard and you've paid your
$$$, it's too late to back out, though.

Getting more experience than I bargained for,

Joe

&gt;I think we need a kind of Old Bus Recovery Squad, a group of us foolish
&gt;enough to respond to requests for on-site assistance with regard to
&gt;evaluating the mechanical condition of old buses, providing our skill and
&gt;expertese extracting said from bogs for the purpose of trailering, towing or
&gt;driving (shrill laughter) the wreck to where ever the new owner wishes to
&gt;commit mechanical seppuku.
