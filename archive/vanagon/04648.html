I ran my '66 Bus in excess of 65mph fairly regularly, I am sorry to
admit.  I blew up the engine a couple times, but maybe that's just a
testament to my mechanical skill...

I saw my counterpart, however, a couple days ago as I and my '85 GL
were merrily cruising down the middle lane of I-495 north of Boston,
keeping pace with traffic at a little over 70mph. Earth Mother in a
mid-70's camper blew past at an estimated 80+.  What a sight and sound!
The muffler was blown out, so her song could be heard for miles.  She
had what looked like mud-caked wooden patio furniture lashed to the 
roof in a most un-aerodynamic fashion.  The bus was that wonderfully
sickening pea-and-avocado-soup color.  I guess you had to be there to
appreciate it, but it was the kind of scene that jars one out of the
'Daily Grind' and into a sense of all-is-right-with-the-world-or-at-
least-for-a-little-while-anyway.  Truly a happy woman, and beyond doubt
Queen of the *Left* Lane!  

Peace.
