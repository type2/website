I mentioned in an earlier post that I'd replaced the rubber seal on the pop-
top on my '76 Camper.
Here is the info on where I got it:

M.L. McCulloch/POPTOPS
POB 2533
Malibu CA 90265

1-800-248-2719 


The price list I have is as of 1/95 and includes the following:

POP-TOP SEALS:  Pre '68 $48; '68-present $69 (pop-top); '68-present $22 
(luggage rack)

CANVAS TOPS (Boots):  '64-'67 $135; '68-'73 $202; '74-'79 $242; '80-'91 $282
                                      The above are tan color 3-Window

ROOF HOLD-DOWNS:  '68-'73 $4 each  (says &quot;Sorry, no pre-'68)

SIDE AWNING KIT:  11' x 16' connects to drip rail, complete w/poles, ropes,
stakes   $179/camel

Other (acrylic) colors are available  at increased cost and delivery time.

OTHER:  Pop-Top Parts Finder $10 w/order, $15 without.  This is a book of 25
+ salvage yards nationwide who &quot;specialize in pop-tops&quot;.

Shipping is UPS GROUND - $8 minimum, $12 for canvas &amp; seal in same order.

Included in my order were VERY good instructions plus a reprint of a 3/89
DB&amp;HVW's article on the seal installation.

I have no connection with this company other than being a satisfied customer
..
I would be happy to answer any additional questions.  Bottom line: it was
easy!
