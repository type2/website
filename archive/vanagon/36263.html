Subject: 21 window fs (SOLD)

Late yesterday evening a gentleman drove up in a 96 Range Rover pulling
a U-Haul trailer and proceeded to peel off 20 Ben Franklins.  I helped
him load the bus up, thanked him, and waved bye...

Was directed to me by a listmember but couldn't remember the name. Said
he got directions to the boneyard from a garage once he got into town...

scary...we're a landmark?
