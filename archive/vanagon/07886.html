Subject: RE- vwoa strikes again ...

All this talk of crushing Vanagons and such conjures up visions of a
VW Type II traveling down the assembly line in Hannover, killing and
maiming recalcitrant workers who flippantly discard their cigarette 
ashes and butts on the virgin upholstery...

Say, none of you folks has a type II named &quot;Christine,&quot; do you?
(or should it be &quot;Kristine&quot;?)
