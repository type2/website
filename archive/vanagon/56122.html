Subject: Re: 84 Westy Hydaulic Lifter problem


&gt;         I have been having problems with the hydraulic lifters loosing there 
&gt; oil fill on my 84 westy 1.9 liter water cooled engine.The heads were
&gt; recently removed and the lifters refilled and all reassembled and all
&gt; appeared fine for a
&gt; few weeks.I do not winter drive the westy so it sits for periods but I run
&gt; it every two weeks and let it warm up.Has any one else out there had this
I think this is your problem. How long does it warm up for? It takes 
a long time to really heat the oil when the van is not driven around 
some. Try driving it for at least half an hour each time, and run 
through some synthetic oil. My lifter noise used to run for 1-2 
minutes each time I let the van sit for 2 weeks or more. With Mobil 
1, the tapping noise lasts for 5-10 seconds at the most, usually it's 
not there at all.

&gt;         One mechanic suggested that a mixture of transmission oil and
&gt; regular oil  run in the motor for a short period would refill the
&gt; lifters.Any experience
&gt; others may have had would be helpful.
&gt; 
I wouldn't advise this due to the heavy weight of trans oil (unless 
he means ATF, for the high detergent properties). Better to try 
Rislone or some such treatment, but with synthetic oil, it's not 
needed.
