RE:  Syncro Air Cleaners, $20.00!

&gt;  I'm letting the list know that I obtained 60 of the Syncro Style Air 
&gt;Cleaners (Will fit any 86&amp; newer).
&gt;
&gt;  I'm selling them for $20.00 each.  Anyone interested in these e-mail 
&gt;me and I'll give you any info you want on them:)

What makes them different from the 5 dollar regular ones you can get at a FLAPS?
