Subject: WTB: 1983 - 5 Speed Tranny - PART II

I've received a number of responses and wanted to add some more detail to my previous 
message.

I am looking for a 5 speed 1983 tranny (ideally with complete shift linkage, engine 
mounts, engine cradle bars, oil filler neck and dip stick arrangement).

I want to replace my 1982 diesel putt-putt with a more powerful diesel. While I know 
that the top end gearing is nearly the same on the 82 as the 83, I am not averse to 
changing it.  I learned of possibility this through my Northern California diesel 
guru - who has sucessfully done similar work.

As far as he knows, the 1983 diesel only came in a 5 speed.  Yes, its rare - but 
nonetheless - its something with which I would like to work.

If you have, or know of someone who has these parts, I would appreciate being 
contacted.

Thanks for all the help.  For those interested in additional discussion on this 
subject - just write.

Tom
