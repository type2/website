I just got my hands on a 69 westy, Chocolate Brown, but hopefully orange 
peal orange in a few months. Cost me $1150 inspected, new front brakes, 
8k miles on engine, less on tranny, dual carb, I'm all set to start 
working very hard this summer to fix this bus up, I hope to have it 
completely done how I like it in two years, think it'll happen? See ya!
