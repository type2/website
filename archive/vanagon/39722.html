Subject: Stopping intake leaks

To the List,

I have a 1.7 liter engine that has developed  a nasty intake leak.  I 
have a Weber progressive with the tube intakes.  I took the intake 
that was leaking off, and resealed it.  About ten minutes later it 
started whistling again.  What is the best way to seal this type of 
intake?  Should I just use the paper gaskets that come with the 
gasket set, or the half-inch thick bakelite gasket?

Also,  while I am on this sealing subject.  What is the best way to 
seal the heat exchangers where they bolt to the heads?  I think I may 
have a leak there too.

Thanks,

Aaron
