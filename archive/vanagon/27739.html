&gt; &gt; To wrap up the famous volkswagen owner thread:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Last night on the Simpson's Halloween special a VW bus split window 
&gt; &gt; was crushed by a falling sign.  Luckily no one was harmed in the 
&gt; &gt; incident.-
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, but did you all notice, that at one time, the close-up showed it
&gt; as having one big bay window? All the while maintaining that distinctive
&gt; V on the nose...
&gt; curious indeed

Maybe a brazilian bus?
