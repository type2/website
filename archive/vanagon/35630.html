If you have problems fixing your cable, consider buying a speedometer 
cable made for an earlier model bus. It will be one cable that goes all 
the way from the hub to the speedometer. (The 2-piece cable and box 
system in your bus does nothing but turn the EGR light on every whatever 
thousandth mile.) It'll probably be alot cheaper....

That's what I did on my '76.
