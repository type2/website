&gt;It blinks for about 3 miles, or until the engine warms up.  Does anyone

i'd bet for air in the system (so go through the bleeding procedure and
see if you get much bubbles/hissing and if the blinking stops). the only
other thing i can think of is that some electronic gizmo in the dash pod
is on the fritz ... but that's supposed to be all for the oil-pressure
system.

also check all your connections for the electrics on the cooling system
(the coolant level sensor, coolant temp sensor, radiator fan switches, etc.)

good luck
