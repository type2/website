Subject: '85 Westy arm rest repair

The &quot;S-Cape&quot; is falling apart! Went to put the inboard drivers armrest 
down &amp; it fell off.  It has left me with 2 sheared off hex head screws.  
I think they are broken because there are only about 5 turns on the screw 
left and it won't hold.  How do I get the broken ends out of the seat 
back and what size screw do I use to fix?  Is this a VW thing only? Any 
help is greatly appreciated!
