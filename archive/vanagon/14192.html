Subject: redrock video viewing!


Just talked with Baldred Prunehead.  He and I, like Sam/Susie Williams
would like to see this video showing thing happen in the near future,
especially before I have to ship off my tape to Blitz Schwarze for
scanning/uploading to the web.  Could we all get together on April
9th, perhaps in the afternoon and watch our various tapes, see
developed snapshots, etc. together?  Suggestions for a location?
Does anyone have a big screen tv?  I don't, unfortunatly, but am
happy to have another bash here, or wherever.

The other possibility is to go somewhere neat just for the day, like
perhaps to Bodega bay.  This wouldn't involve camping, but just a day
excursion.  We discussed trying to do a camp out there or somewhere
similar, but decided it would be getting too close to GNATT, so
will just make the first part of GNATT that trip, and then plan
another one for as soon thereafter as people would like.

What's the concensus?  April 9 ok?  Place?
