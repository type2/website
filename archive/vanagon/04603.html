Ok,

y'all with dualport 1600cc ingins in your bus can respond to this one.  
What is your top freeway speed(on flat ground), and how often do you go 
through ingins?

I'm interested because I've had my bus for almost a year, and I really 
baby it.  It drives no more than 55, yet I've seen similar buses(same 
year range 68-70) scootin by me, and I always think &quot;Boy, they must not 
like their motors&quot;.

So what's the scoop, am I a Wolkswagen Weenie, or are these people just 
askin to blow up thier engine(oops! ingin)?

Inquiring minds want to know.

Jon
