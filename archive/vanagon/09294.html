So Thom Fitzpatrick says:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;and what years/models they were:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  56 Microbus    4    68 Bus   13    80 Vanagon   16    92 Eurovan    1
&gt; 
&gt; _4_ '56s ?  What gives?
&gt; 

Maybe the stats master could put a designation as to which are running
and which are not? ;)  Better hurry up Thom... ;P

BTW, saw the pics on Davids VW page.  Nice shots.  Doesn't quite do justice
to the real thing, but that's to be expected.
