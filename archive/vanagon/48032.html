Subject: The Bus-in-the-Shop Blues

Hi All,

I always try to do my own work.  Kinda a 'Just do it' type more than the
'Do-it-Yourselfer' ideology.  I guess it's my pioneering family
background.  8-)   I really haven't considered getting work
done at the local VW shop if I could help it, but I have given in lately.
The 84 'Brownie Bus' needed AC attention, something that is out of my
league and legality.  In addition, the left rear wheel brg has always been
suspiciously worn, so I bit the bullet and am having it replaced.  Now I
feel guilty about not doing it myself.  I feel like I have abandoned my
Vanagon daily driver at the shop and it is mad at me.  8-\  Maybe the new
tires I got for it has earned me enough 'brownie points' to make up for
it.  These VW's have strong personalities!  I hope it doesn't hold
grudges, we have a lot of long trips to go on.  8-)
