&gt;&gt;Talked to a VWoA lady, described the problem, told her my 83' westy has only
&gt;&gt;61k original miles. ...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  If you enjoy the vehicle, bite the bullet and fix it on your own.
&gt;&gt;  No point in being irritated at VWoA or whoever it was you talked to
&gt;&gt;  on the phone.

I am talking about a bill possibly at $2000 or more if cylinder heads need
to be replaced. Will you bite the bullet? Seriously if you bought a new westy
and began to have such problem at 46k miles and had to park it since it
overheated whenever it was driven are you going to say forget it just swallow
the bill? Maybe just go buy a new 93 westy and get the same problem again
at 46k miles. That will be fun to swallow the bill again.
