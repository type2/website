If anyone wants to see pictures of my 1987 Vanagon GL, point your 
browser to:

http://www.lehigh_dot_edu/~bls3/bls3.html

There are a few pictures in the VW VAN LINKS area and also a few 
under the BLIZZARD OF 96 area.

There's really nothing special about this van, but I've owned it from 
new and even though it now has 130K miles on it, I'm still proud of 
it. :-)

Later. . . . . . . .Brad
