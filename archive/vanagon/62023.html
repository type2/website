Subject: Fwd: My    1st 1st 1st 1st 1st   Westy  -'84 Westy information

-- [ From:  * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --

Kenneth,

I have an 84 Westy. My experience has been good and free of major
catastrophes. 

Some insights: 

After 14 years in service, there is a high probability that the fuel
lines/fittings may be in need of replacement, especially the plastic &quot;Y&quot;
fittings into the top of the fuel tank.  Approach them from the wheel wells
for initial &quot;feel by hand&quot; inspection.  Drop the spare tire tray (remove
the pin) to access them from under the van.  NO NEED to drop the tank.

CV joints need to be inspected, no doubt, especially after the above-
mentioned 14 years of service.

I give attention to oil weight and oil filter requirements for our climate
and for our operating characteristics.  I've used 20-50 oil and OEM filters
to avoid any oil pressure problems.  I keep the VW in the Southern
California desert, so cold weather starting problems are minimum. Other
listees may have other insights in respect to climatic condition
requirements.

I keep a watchful eye on the distributor cap, rotor and spark plugs. I
follow the recommended durations for replacements and brands. I keep to
Bosch, notwithstanding some perceived additional expense.  &quot;Pay me now, or
pay me later.&quot;

With respect to the Dometic appliances, I have little problem lighting the
fridge if I attach city power to the 120 exterior plug and run the fridge
overnight before lighting the propane.  I use the propane for refrigeration
underway or parked. Additionally, I've acquired a small battery-powered fan 
($15.00 at Camping World) for improved circulation, and cooling, in the
fridge.

I've cheated to avoid replacing the drooping rubber gasket by picking out
the rusted spring and applying GE Silicone goop, sparingly, into the gasket
and hand-holding each 6&quot; or 8&quot; segment I've adhesed. Ron at busdepot_dot_com
offers them at a reasonable price. ( Usual disclaimers apply.) My patches
have endured two, usual, hot summers in the desert and a fall and a winter
in the East.   The key word is sparingly. You can &quot;thumb off&quot;  any excess. 
 Contact cement, in my opinion, would scar the Fibreglas top and should be
avoided. 

More technical minds than mine can verse you on the fine distinctions
between Digijet and Digifant FI.   I change all filters, in all crevices
and nooks and crannies, with religious attention. The fuel filter merits my
special devotion.  Look, too, for contaminated brake and clutch fluid.
Consider purging to set your milepost for periodic replacement of fluid. 
Corrupted fluid breeds a raft of problems, especially in the 83.5 and the
84 Vanagon, in rusted brakes, failed clutch slave cylinder and general
brake health, I'm told.

Our clutch is original and the mileage is 153,000. The PO and I both
learned to drive in the early &quot;three on the floor&quot; days, in low, so TLC of
the clutch may be part of the lifespan.

My AC is an aftermarket installation which is in wide open operation about
half of the year, and which puts an available HP demand on the 1.9 engine
to no appearant damage to the powerplant. During the rest of the year, we
run it twice a week to keep the seals intact.  I see my friendly Pep Boys
for the $19.95&quot; AC &quot;special&quot; evaluation, annually  The $19.95 is credited
if work is needed on the system.

Keep in touch on the '84. Good luck.

Subject: My    1st 1st 1st 1st 1st   Westy

I just bought my first Westfalia.   It is my 8th VW, second Vanagon,but
first full camper.   The owner gets back in town tomorrow, I am beside
myself with excitment.  This is worse than a child on Christmas morning.  I
can't even focus on work, it's all I can think about.  OK I have it under
control!! 

Are 84 models prone to special problems that I should be aware of ?  It
only has 61,000 miles on it.  The PO said he put a new clutch in less than
a year ago.  Is that normal?  My other Vanagon has 110k on the original
clutch.    The AC compressor sounds like it has loose marbles in it.  I
know don't run it.  I will likely unhook it to avoid messing it up.   The
last question is what type of glue should I use to reattach the sagging top
seals.  They are in good condition but they are coming loose from the fiber
glass.   Will contact cement work?

Excuse me while I do little volkswagen dance.

I await your response.
If you can please call with advice 1-800-264-6757.
