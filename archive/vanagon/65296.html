&gt;The current &quot;SparkOMatic&quot; radio the DPO installed is awful. I remember
&gt;seeing something about a limited depth of the dash space for the
&gt;vanagon radio, so I am wondering what radios actually fit, IOW, what
&gt;is the maximum depth the radio can go?
&gt;
&gt;If anyone has a used original equipment radio, I'd be very interested,
&gt;providing it works ;-).
&gt;
&gt;Also, any suggestions for a source for a new antenna?

I have the same problem. My old radio, a Deadwood (kenwood) bit the dust
and now I have a nice hole in the dash. I measured the space and it seems
the problem is depth as the heater box/radiator intrudes into the radio
space. I measured about 6&quot; of depth - but that is misleading as the
intrusion is at the bottom of the space - not the top.

You can look at crutchfield www.crutchfield_dot_com for information on space
and what radios fit. Interesting they note to call for information on
installing radios in the Vanagon.
