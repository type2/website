Subject: Re: RESULTS - Tire Survey

Since I am buying a &quot;new&quot; '91 Westy and upgrading to the factory Alloys, I am
particularly interested in this tire survey info. I would like the specific
subset of data on the 205/70 R14 tires as this is the size specified in the
VW brochure as being appropriate for the factory Alloys.

[Actually the brochure specifies 'P205/70 R14 tires.]

In my own searching for tires of this particular size, I went to the TireRack
online and found 'slim pickins'. Here is what I found - I am interested in
finding out how this meshes with the survey data and anyone's personal
experience.

Tire Rack options:

Brigestone: Potenza RE900     205/70 TR 14     $59
            Potenza RE92      205/70 HR 14     $59
            Turnanza QL20     
                     T rated  205/70 TR 14     call
            'Orig Eq' S402    205/70  R 14     $47

Dunlop:     Sp40 A/S         P205/70 SR 14     $50  *****

Pirelli:    P400 Touring      205/70 TR 14     $59
            P4000 Super Tour  205/70 HR 14     call
            P700Z             205/70 TR 14     call

Yokohama:   A378              205/70 HR 14     $48
            'Orig Eq&quot; tires:
                A321          205/70 VR 14     $85
                Y372          205/70 SR 14     $48
                Y382         P205/70  R 14     $57  *****

***** Actual 'match' to the VW specs. Only 2 matches.


There were NO Sport/light truck tires listed at this size. There appeared to
be only:

     205/75 SR 14 and
     215/70 HR 14

tires listed in this catagory.

Another question - I know that 'SR' means 'sport radial' and that 'R' simply
means 'radial'. I also believe that the 'P' before the id means 'passenger'
I do not know the meanings of 'VR', 'HR', and 'TR'. I'd rather not guess.

None of the tires state that they are reinforced. And, are the 'Orig Eq' tires
actually tires that meet specs for being shipped on vehicles from manufacturers
My local tire man has told me that &quot;original factory tires ALWAYS wear better
and longer than ANY replacement tires.&quot; Is he correct? If so, shouldn't I
go for that choice?

Any correlation between survey data and the tires listed above would be 
helpful! Any input on what any of YOU would choose for quality and longevity
would be helpful.

NOTE: The prices are only included for comparison purposes. These were the 
prices listed as of yesterday - and I am in no way trying to promote the
TireRack. I will probably buy locally for the associated service (mounting,
balancing and rotation every 10k miles) but I do use Tire Rack as a point of
reference so that I can ask for what I want with some knowledge.

Thankx-
