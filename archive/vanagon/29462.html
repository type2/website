&gt; &gt;&gt; My, how PC.  Who am I to buck this ever-so-benificent trend?

&gt; &gt;sure, I'll have a go...
&gt; &gt;how about if we refer to those who have a problem with &quot;the PC BS&quot; as
&gt; &gt;&quot;compassion compromised&quot;?

I doubt that it is irrelevant to those people who have to deal with these 
types of problems.
Could it be that you would have an easier time dealing with a 
MONOSYLLABIC (short) slang term?  
Why is it that when it is just as easy to let someone refer to a group in 
a way that attempts to be more understanding and less stereotyping 
someone else  who thinks they are being clever always seems to need to 
attack that?
IMHO there is no point in that Rush Limbaughish bullying just because you 
don't choose to adopt that point view.
At least at Thanksgiving you can be glad that you don't have to put up 
with reprocussions of negative stereotyping.
