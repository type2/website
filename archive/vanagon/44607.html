Subject: Citroen 2CV (was: Aircooled business sighting in MA)


&gt; the only thing
&gt;stranger than a bunch of bus owners at a show are a bunch of citroen freaks
&gt;zipping around with their hydraulic suspensions.

Brings up the old joke, about a VW Beetle and a Citroen 2CV sitting
side by side in a car lot.

The salesman displays the Bug, and says &quot;Here's the new 1967 Volkswagen
Sedan, with all these great features, blah blah blah.&quot; Then he points
to the Citroen 2CV, and says &quot;...and this is the box it came in.&quot;

     :^)



   (don't shoot, 2CV lovers, its just a joke)
