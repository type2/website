Joel is complaining about the lack of silliness so I thought I would 
help out.  I walked to the grocery store last night and bought some 
grits.  I walked because the bus is still buried under snow and even 
if it wasn't I wouldn't drive it on these slick roads with all these 
other manics.  I fixed up the grits, gave them a liberal dash of brown
sugar and milk and ate them up.  I thought of you all.  This was my 
first bowl of grits.  I found them quite tasty.  

Obligitory VW content: Thanks for all the 
advice about the rust.  I am glad it sparked a debate about 
everyones favorite method of removal.  This is how we all learn.  For 
this I give much thanks.  When the weather clears a little I am going 
to go to it.  After I remove the surface rust and treat it with rust 
inhibitor I plan on covering that some paint so that 
it will at least look ok from a block or two.  As I said before, I 
want to stop the rust now and properly repair or replace panels when 
the wealth of the world catches up with me.  At the risk of started a 
debate:  What paint would work best for this?  Do they make some type 
of automotive quality paint in a spray can?  Thanks, Jim
