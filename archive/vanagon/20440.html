Question numero tres (is this fun or what?!):I'll be leaving for my road trip
at the end of this month. I am travelling with one other person who is also a
woman. Because it's a '71 Bus with rainbow curtains, should I fret the Law??
I'm legal and 'Mona's legal, but I have this itchy problem with being asked
to step out of the car. Have any of you run into raod trip problemos that
concern local authorities?? Do you kiss ass??? Do you let them search your
van?? Do ya try fer the border?

  Depends on how each individual officer handles it/ presents him/herself.
  Meet their gaze, if you've got nothing to hide then you've got nothing
  to hide, but that sure doesn't mean that you need to allow them to go
  on a fishing expedition. I'd be hardassed about it if the cop was being
  a jerk. And I'd probably be happy to show off my Transporter if the cop
  seemed interested in the car...
