Subject: AC condensation

As summer approaches I have a question about the condensation drains in my 88
w'falia.   While I can pour water into the pan from a pop bottle and observe
it drain to fhe ground, when I run the AC for extended periods the pan will
overflow and fill that overhead compartment with water.  Has anybody ever
experienced this ?
