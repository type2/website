Subject: Rabbit/Jetta engine swap

Hi all,  would anyone with info/thoughts on this possibility for a wasser 
boxer conversion please send me direct. That includes the informative post 2 
wks ago that I trashed (by Bill Kennedy, maybe?). Any opinions of 
models/years as 'best choice' engine to use in transplant, ie. GTi, GLX, 
Scirroco?. I want to stay gas, so no turbo diesels. Kennedy Engineering make 
swap kits for this application, but say not to use the diesel bellhousing, 
buy their adapter instead! tia, tim s.
