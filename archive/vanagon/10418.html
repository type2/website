Subject: Re: [Q] Decreasing gear ratio

&gt;From: Bradley &lt;bradleym_at_netcom_dot_com&gt;:
&gt;Maybe he meant a '66 bus, because I think I turn 4k RPM at 60 MPH.  :)
&gt;And what is the stock tire size, 195-75x14?

No, I meant '69  ;-)
and I run 185-70R14s.  Apparently there were four versions of this 
tranny, with normal and mountain gears, with and without limited slip.
I examined my case and it is stamped 'CA' which means 'normal'.  However,
I still have the 4K rpms at 60 mph, so I suspect someone has put
other gears into it at some point.  Since I have other minor problems
with the tranny, I'm investigating having it rebuilt with a lower
ratio gear set.  The guy at the buggy shop told me today that I want
a '74 or '75 T1 tranny.  Anybody know for sure?  He also said the dune 
buggy guys are snapping up all our bus trannies, making them scarce.  
Dirty rotters.
