Subject: oil temp gauge...

    Dear fellow buspeople,
  i'm just about to drill the hole into the sump plate to install the VDO
oil temp gauge in my 73 bus, and i was wondering: the sender unit has only
this copper ring for a gasket, is that gonna be enough ? plus, how about the
sump plate itsself...i'm worried it will leak when i put it back in, should i
seal it with RTV compound or not ? any experiences (however leaky) out there
???    ciao,
            gregor WPCHI)                         HP LaserJet III
