Subject: tranny shaft&amp;seal

I'm finally about to install  a carefully rebuilt 2.0 liter in an 81 
vanagon - checking that main shaft tranny seal I see that the shaft 
itself has a bit of free play to it - i.e. a wiggle side to side, not 
solidly solid - does anyone know if this is normal? I'd barely driven 
this van before tearing it down, it seemed to shift and drive well - but 
I'd really like to know previous to installing the motor. Any info on 
this would be appreciated.
