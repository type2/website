Subject: '79 FI Transporter - High Idle Speed

All,


I have a '79 non-California Transporter with fuel-injected new engine 
and Pertronix Ignitor Hall Cell points/condensor replacement unit.  The 
EGR, most of which had rusted out, has been removed and the 
connection plugged.   I installed an aftermarket dual quiet pack muffler 
made specifically for this engine.

Maybe somebody out there can offer me another perspective on this 
problem:

The engine won't idle below 1300 or so RPM.  It's a steady idle and the 
engine runs very smoothly, but ideally the idle should be around 900 
RPM. The dwell is a constant 59 degrees.  The timing is set at 7.5 
degrees  BTDC at 900 RPM.  (I managed to get the idle down temporarily 
to 900 RPM by unplugging the top air hose to the decel valve and 
obstructing about half of the opening, leaving it partially open.)  The 
bypass screw (idle) is turned all the way in.  I've checked everywhere 
for vacuum or air leaks.

Anybody got any ideas?

RDR
