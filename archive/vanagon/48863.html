Subject: EV vs. Windstar length

Another interesting thing I noticed
this past weekend:

Friends of our have just bought a Ford Windstar.  We parked
the Windstar and the EV side-by-side, and guess what? The Windstar
is _longer_ than the EV by about 6-8 inches!!!  Yet, if you've
ever been inside a Windstar, you can tell there's about 1/2 interior
space of an EV in there!!!

....no need to say I was _very_ proud of the EV this weekend...
