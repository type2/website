Subject: mech in northen VA

hi-


OK, so I've read the list enough to know that I should change the brake fluid 
&amp; antifreeze.  The oil drain is also stripped.   I've gotten so far as to buy 
the antifreeze, but the jobs don't seem to get done between work, kids, biking 
etc.

does anyone now a really good wasserboxer mechanic in the northern VA (DC 
'burbs) area ?   any handy (and experienced) listmembers who would like to 
make a little a $ and get a dinner or two?

thanks volks!
