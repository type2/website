Subject: Re: Rear Brake Drum Puller


At some point, somebody wrote:

&gt; &gt; Well, my '85 Westy is making some strange metallic squealing noises 
&gt; &gt; out of the rear brakes when they are cold.  I want to check them so I 
&gt; &gt; consulted the Bentley Manual for the disassembly procedure.  Bentley 
&gt; &gt; shows a special tool that looks like a gear puller to remove the rear 
&gt; &gt; drums.  Is there an easy &amp; safe way to remove the rear drums without 
&gt; &gt; this tool?  Could you use a standard gear puller (not that I have one 
&gt; &gt; of these either but I am more willing to buy this tool)?  Any tips or 
&gt; &gt; tricks to pull the rear drums would be apperciated.

I didn't see the original post (mail server problems?) but I've read two
replies which said, in essence, &quot;Hit it with a hammer!&quot;

Just to make it clear (sorry if someone else has already made it clear),
the Bentley procedure, using the puller, is if you want to remove BOTH THE
DRUM AND THE HUB TOEGETHER.

Since the drum and hub are &quot;split&quot; (i.e., are two different pieces) then 
you can remove the drum without removing the hub.  Since the hub is held
in place with a nut with something like 350 ft.-lbs. of torque, obviously
you will need a puller if you are REMOVING THE HUB AND DRUM AS A UNIT.

If you are only removing the drum, then you should (in theory) be able to
remove the 2 small bolts which hold the drum to the hub, and pull off the
drum with your bare hands.  Notice I said &quot;in theory&quot;, because sometimes
the hub and drum become bonded one to the other (rust together).  Here's
where the hammer action comes into play and the two posts I read are correct.

You tap, tap, tap around the face of the drum, then tug, tug, tug.
Then you Tap, Tap, Tap, Tug, Tug, Tug.
         TAp, TAp, TAp, TUg, TUg, TUg.
         TAP, TAP, TAP, TUG, TUG, TUG etc.

If you're only removing the smooth round drum, there's hardly any way to
get any kind of puller on it.

Sorry if this is already obvious.
