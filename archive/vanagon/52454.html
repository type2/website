Subject: Volks Cafe and Canadian owners

I just wanted to relay to the list my *extremely* positive  
experience with Kyle at the Volks Cafe.  I had a bunch of parts  
shipped to me (some old; some new).  All arrived safe and sound.   
The approach I took was to have it shipped FedEx Economy which takes  
about 3 days.  You pay a bit of duty, but even then the prices are  
very reasonable.  Kyle had to do a fair bit of hunting for all kinds  
of odds and ends, and even added the Gas Tank venting kit as the  
package was due to ship in response to a middle of the night e-mail  
message.  All in all, highly recommended.

Cheers,
  - pavneet
