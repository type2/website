Subject: Stuck shifter ?'s

The shifter on my '86 is not cooperating. It doesn't want to go into any
gear with or without the engine on or clutch depressed. I bled the clutch
and it seems fine. The linkage looks OK and the mid-shaft clamp (behind the
gas tank) hasn't come loose. My next test is to remove the linkage from the
tranny to see if I can shift it by hand. This would eliminate a linkage
problem. Is it possible to shift gears by hand on a good tranny, or would I
need more leverage?

I don't think it's a clutch problem because when I did force it into first
gear (to limp it home) it smoothly engaged when I let it out.

Do you all think my manual shift test (without linkage) will uncover the
problem? And if the worst is true (broken syncro hub?) should I drop the
tranny off at a good garage to fix it, buy a rebuild or attempt surgery
myself. (Just finished a Subaru heart transplant- patient is doing well).
