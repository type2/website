Subject: Re: A/C for the Inuvik trip

I know of a gentleman that has been engineering A/C systems for 
aircooled VW's for about 20+ years w/ great success.  You may want to 
speak w/ him.  If so, send me some email and I'll dig out his 
phone number for you.  The business name is European Cooler Air.
