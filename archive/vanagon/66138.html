Subject:      bigtime idle problems

hello all,

My '84 westy just developed an idle/stalling problem.  when I start the
van it
begins to backfire, run rough, and knock, then stalls.  if I give it some
gas it get slightly better but begins to blow white smoke.  It has run
fine upto this point, it started this just after a 4 hour trip on which
it performed fine.
I've checked all the wires and every thing seems to be fine.
any help would be great, I need to get my van running again!

Thanks,
Mike D.
