Subject: DEALER SURVEY PLEASE RESPOND.
Date: Tue, 14 Mar 95 21:38:58 EST

I recently started this survey on the Corrado list where
I received a reasonable response but I figure the Vanagon
list being bigger and full of more long term VW owners
can easily outdo the Corrado people.  I want to quickly
characterize the DEALERS only in this (or any) country in order to
put together a FAQ giving you proven (from others experience)
alternatives in your area if you have problems with your
current/closest dealer or in case you move so you don't have
to sort through dealers with bad attitudes and practices. I
want response from the Vanagon/Eurovan crowd primarily because
like the Corrado these were relatively limited in production and
have quite a few interesting problems that a good dealer might
have sorted out but all too typical bad dealers will ignore.
Now before the air cooled people rise up in anger I want to say
your experiences are also appreciated, my current van is of an
aircooled persuasion itself, but in general it is asking a bit
much of a dealer to be up on the latest in parts and service
for an aircooled bus.  Since a lot of you probably own H20 VW's
as well let me here about your experiences getting them serviced
but all replies are greatly appreciated and will be reported.
I would appreciate a short response in the following general form.

&gt; Dealer, Location

&gt; Sales: n
&gt; Service: n
&gt; Parts: n
&gt; Paint/Body: n (include reference to shop if farmed out)
&gt; Overall: n
&gt; Would you return: (y/n)

&gt; A general comment characterizing dealership.

n is 1 to 5 (5 is best)

Feel free to expound as much as you like and rate every dealer you
have used in the last 5 years in as many areas as you had experience
with, but I am only asking for a name and a few numbers, please
take the time, you may never need the info and may be perfectly
happy with your dealer but tell me that so others can be happy 
as well.  If the dealers attitude changed after warranty expired
note things like that as well.  I intend to append the results to
the mechanics FAQ at UMD or make it a separate FAQ and am strongly
considering mailing it as a wake up call to VWOA.

PLEASE EMAIL THE RESPONSE TO ME DIRECTLY NOT TO THE MAILIST

send it
