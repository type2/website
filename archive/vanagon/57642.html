Subject: ALERT! - - e-mail virus

An alert has been posted by IBM regarding a possible e-mail virus on the Internet.

The virus is being transmitted using an e-mail message titled &quot;PENPAL GREETINGS!&quot;.

If you receive such a message, DO NOT OPEN!

The text of the message asks if you are interested in being a penpal.  While you are reading 
the message, a &quot;trojan horse&quot; virus will be infecting your hard drive's boot sector.  Also, 
once the message is opened, it will automatically forward itself the anyone listed in your 
e-mail.

Again, if you receive a message titled PENPAL GREETINGS!, delete this message without 
opening it.


COMMENT:  I have received this information through my wife's company's
          corporate IMS department.  This information is 3rd or 4th
          hand, so I do not know how valid it is.  This is simply
          meant to be a word of caution and not to create a panic.  I
          have no idea how transmitting viruses via e-mail would work,
          or if it would work.
