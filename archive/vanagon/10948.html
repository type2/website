&gt;&gt;If it ain't split, it ain't sh*t!!!
&gt;
&gt;Taking this one more logical step, is it not reasonable that:
&gt;
&gt;If it _IS_ split, it _IS_ sh*t!!!  ???

Actually, that would be:
If it is shit, then it is split. &lt;nerdish grin&gt;

And just for Joel, I looked at the data...

These are the correlations between US imports and representation on this
list for all years and for the three models separately (note that US
imports were time time-lagged, since the '75 models were (mostly) imported
in '74, for example): &lt;drum roll&gt;

all years	micros		busses		vanagons
0.40		0.44		0.45		0.65
