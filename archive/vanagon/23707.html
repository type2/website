&gt; Always buy parts that are designed for the year and model vehicle that

&gt; well versed in which parts fall into this category play it safe and buy 
&gt; parts for the vehicle make and model year.

Even so, you can still have problems.  I got a new clutch cable for my 
bus, and it had larger threaded end for the wing nut.  The original one 
was a little smaller, and just had a double nut (old system).  So I took 
it back to the VW store and told them of the problem, so they said I 
needed a new boden tube.  So I got one, and it still didn't go through.  
So again I returned and told them of my problems, it seems that where the 
end of the clutch cable is crimped on the end of the cable was to wide.  
And all of the cables had the problem.  So I had to file a little off to 
make it fit.  That's aftermarket parts for ya.
