&gt;I have a '74 Bus (1800) which has low compression (~90 psi) on all
&gt;four cylinders.  I rebuilt the engine 10k miles ago; the compression

&gt;unreasonably so.  So the questions are: are these compression numbers
&gt;very, very bad, and is there anything to worry about?  The engine
&gt;might come out soon so that I can get some transmission work done --

Geeze!  I'm replacing my motor because 2 cylinders had 92# compression!
Are you sure its put together right?
