Subject: Missing Oil

Here's a mystery for ya folks.

I rebuilt my 85 wasserboxer recently.  I've just put 1000 miles on it and did
my first oil/filter change.  Pressure is good (48 lbs under load).  Temp is
fine.  The problem is I've been having to add a full quart of oil every tank
full of gas.  I'm getting about 250 miles to the tank.  When I did the oil
change, I found a VERY TINY oil leak from around the oil pressure sending
unit.  There was about a 2 inch puddle under the sending unit on the floor
after sitting overnight.

I don't see any blue smoke and I just passed my emmissions test.  Results
are:

Test       Standard    My test
CO%      1.20           0.22 
HC ppm  220            194
Dilution   6.00           13.32
rpm        1600           804

I have since adjusted my idle to 950 but the oil loss/consumption is the
same.  Anyone have any ideas where my oil is going?
