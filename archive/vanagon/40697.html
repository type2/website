&gt;I'm still looking for some measurements on wheel stud diameters.
&gt;I want to know if its possible to redril the wheels/rims instead of the 
&gt;drums, I want to fit 4 stud rims on to 5 stud baywindow (small pattern) 
&gt;drums.

What 4 hole wheel are you trying to put on a Bus and why?  Do not even think
of modifying wheels that way. Wheels are designed to be &quot;supported&quot; where the
bolts are located.  There is a great deal of engineering designed into the
wheel mounting system.  It is not as staight forward as just holding the
wheel on the drum or rotor.  When the wheel fails from being modified, and
somone gets hurt, someone will get Sued.  If you are under 21 it will
probably be your parents.
