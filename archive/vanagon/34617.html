&gt;Is there a way to install temporary seats in the open space between the =

&gt;
&gt;Go get the double bench seat and two rails from a junkyard.  If you can 
&gt;figure out how to get the flooring up out of the way, you can remove the six

&gt;big plastic threaded plugs into the floor metal and bolt down the tracks, 
&gt;get the bolts too! Then slide in the seat. Slide out when not wanted.  You  
&gt;can't get into the fridge unless you slide the seat out half way.  I did 
&gt;this in my Westy conversion, but I was putting in fresh flooring, so I just 
&gt;carefully made it so a panel about 18&quot; x 40&quot; lifts out once the carpet is 
&gt;rolled up, exposing the rails for 2 minute install.  All VW stock 
&gt;installation, safest way I feel. You need to remount one lapbelt end onto 
&gt;the seat frame, since normally the winder unit is in the wall. You may be 
&gt;able to do the flooring cut with a Skil saw set for shallow depth, 1/4&quot; or 
&gt;so. Nothing electrical in the way :)  Tim Smith
&gt;
The &quot;normal&quot; position for this seat is against the left wall of the van.
 Since the Westy stuff is already there, you would be mounting it toward the
right side of the van.  I doubt the holes would line up, but drilling a few
new ones would be easy.  On my van, all the seat belts mount to the seat
assembly, so you might not have any seatbelt work to do depending on the seat
you get.  The seatbelt arrangement is likely different in earlier year's
given Tim's advice above.
