Having worked at a dealer some time ago, I can assure you that the oil pan
on a diesel Vanagon is considerably different from the equivalent part on a
Rabbit.  It has to do with the angle at which the engine is mounted; nearly
vertical in the Rabbit compared to a 45 degree (approx.) angle in the
Vanagon.  This seems to be a rare part (i.e. expensive), so overboring and
threading seems to be the preferred way to go.
