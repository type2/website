&gt;with no problem (fingers crossed).

&gt;Devil's Rope, it turn out, refers to barbed wire, and this
&gt;is the first and only museum dedicated to it that I have
&gt;ever seen, or even heard of. Did you know that, when the
&gt;railroads were first building across the country, they
&gt;fenced off their rights-of-way with this stuff, and had the
&gt;Glidden Co. design a special, unique kind so that any
&gt;farmers who stole it for their own use, would be easier to
&gt;catch and prosecute?  Now you do.

BTDT, bought the barbed wire.  DeKalb, Illinois is where the
Glidden folk lived.  The High School team is the &quot;Barbs&quot;.
There's Barb City This and Barb City That.

&gt;Damn it, this is not the way to do Route 66-- there are
&gt;hundreds of interesting places/people to see. Maybe when I'm
&gt;rich and famous...

I live right off Annie Glidden Road (the daughter).  I'm not
that interesting, but you don't have to be rich and
famous...
