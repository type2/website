Subject:      Eurovan tires and ac

Thanks to those who offered help on the Eurovan tires and the
thumping, uneven wear, etc.  I purchased a set of Michelin Agilis 51
tires for the EV yesterday.  They are 205/65/R15 C.  Eureka!  This is
like getting a brandy new van.  Finally, a smooth and quiet ride.  The
difference is night and day.  They call for around 50 PSI but Discount
Tire recommended I run slightly lower unless loaded.  Also,  in
Eurovan Update, there is an entire article in last month's issue
devoted to the air conditioner woes of the EV.
