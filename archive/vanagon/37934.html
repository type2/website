Subject: Buy the list admin a beer!

Okay Volks,
	Here is your chance to give something back to the guy that is
responsible for running this list.  You know, the Vanagon list, the one
that has provided you with priceless information, new friends, and
occasionally some good humor.  :)  
	Recently someone on the list mentioned that they would like to buy
Gerry a beer.  I posted some information on BOTM (Beer of the Month)
clubs that will mail new and exciting microbrews to one's house every
month for a price.  Thirty minutes later I had mail from half a dozen
people committing funds for this purpose.  So, I propose to do the
following:

I will research the BOTM clubs and find an appropriate one (reasonable
cost, good beer).

List members send me contributions to pay for it, and I'll subscribe 
Gerry to the service.

I will create a web page detailing the cost of the service, and
contributions received.  Question - should I list names and $ amounts of
contributors?

As needed, I will request more contributions from the list to keep it
going. will use 100% of the money I receive to pay for the beer, Steve!  :)

I will keep the subscription going until funds run out or Gerry gets
tired of those beers littering his doorstep (yah right!!).

Here's what I need you listmembers to do:

Mail a contribution to me at:

David Schwarze
P.O. Box 84183
San Diego, Calif. 92138-4183

It can be any amount you like.  I would recommend $5 or $10.
US funds prefered, but I'm sure I can find a place to convert Canadian
or other funds.  Most of the clubs seem to offer 4-6 beers a month for
around $20, so $5 would be &quot;buying Gerry a beer&quot;, $10 would be &quot;buying
Gerry two beers&quot;, and so on.  Checks are preferred, but cash okay too if
you're willing to risk it.  As soon as I have enough to cover a 3 month
subscription (most BOTM clubs want at least that to start) I'll start
the service.  If the response is good enough, we should consider buying
Joel a subscription too, since he played a large part in getting this
list started too.  For those who mailed me privately about this, please
accept this post as a response.  :)

Sending a contribution will be considered a one-time thing - I won't
badger contributors for more donations in the future, although I will
post to the list at large when funds run out.

#define SOAPBOXMODE ON

So how about it?  Shall we all buy our list administrator a beer or two?
Don't you agree he deserves it?  After providing us with this list for
free for two years, it's about time we did something to pay him back.
