Terry,

Replacing the brake lines on a bus (at least, on an early one) was a snap
compared to doing a bug.  Brake line replacement is a standard overhaul item
(why do you think every parts house stocks them?).  The key point here is
that when labor costs are not a factor, it makes good sense to use stainless
steel.
