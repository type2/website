Subject: valve adjustment + what else
Date: Fri, 5 Jan 1996 15:48:25 -0800 (PST)

ok, after much talk i bought gaskets and am going to do my first valve
adjustment this weekend (please don't ask how many miles its been
since the last). i've read about it, looks totaly doable and then
some, two questions before sunday rolls around...

1) as far as glue for the gaskets, i've heard use silicone based glue
or whell bearing grease.  anyone have an opinion.

2) besides looking around a lot, anything else i can do while i've got
the covers off?  check the torque on the heads??  (as if i have a clue
as to what that means at this moment).  

as always, thanks everyone for advice and stories.  also i'll be
checking out that 64 down the block a little more thoroughly.

take care all,
	   brandy
