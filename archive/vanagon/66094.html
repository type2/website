Subject:      Power Locks

Hello again, everybody -

Respecting that engine failures, leaky heads, major mechanical disorders are
probably a lot more in need of your help, I do ask that, if you are familiar
with this minor problem, please let me know:  The power locking feature of my
'91 Carat seems to be getting a little sluggish in the sliding door only.
 Mechanically, the door seems to be fine.  I cleaned the electrical contacts
on both the door and the jam, but I notice that when I lock the bus globally,
either with a key or from inside, the slider either delays locking or fails
to lock at all.  A little jiggling (sp?) of the sliding door handle usually
'wakes it up' and it then locks.

I'm all ears.  Many thanks.

Sam (Penn Valley, PA)

'91 Carat (85K)
