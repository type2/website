I too have this only in cold weather. I thought it was the spare tire at
first, but no go! Again, only in cold weather. Any ideas?

BTW, the squeak is on my '83.5 (temporarily NOT for sale, might be keeping
both :-)

&gt; Helloall
&gt; 
&gt; There is a pronounced squeak emanating from under the front passenger
seat
&gt; |on 89 Westy. Squeaks regardless of whether or not a passenger is seated.
&gt; Any suggestions?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
