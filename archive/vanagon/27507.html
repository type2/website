Subject: 1980 Vanagon

Ok, I have Roger (my Vanagon) up on jack stands. The gas has been drained 
from the tank. I've been nosing around under there before I start 
removing the tank. No one told me about these, but just happened up pick 
up a Haynes manual on the 1980 - 82 Vanagons. In there they detail 
removal of the gas tank for inspection and repairs. They mention the two 
plastic expansion tanks, one on each side. I looked over mine and noticed 
the one on the driver's side appears to have been leaking around the two 
hoses coming out of the bottom of it. Anyone know what these tanks are for. 
Can they still be purchased new from VW? Do I need them? What's a boy to do?
