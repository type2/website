Subject: Replacing Coolant... Tips Anyone?
Date: Tue, 3 May 94 10:35:22 PDT


I'm going to replace my coolant soon, and although I've read the 
Bentley description of this little chore, I was hoping some netters
who have already done this could offer some tips or gotcha's.

I remember reading one poster describing the process as being 
&quot;black magic&quot;.  I've got three bottles of the VW anti-freeze, and
will be out searching for distilled water again.  Is it just California,
or is distilled water no longer sold at Kmart?  All they have have is
mineral water.

If there's any good tips out there, maybe they should be added to 
that ever-expanding &quot;faq&quot; that exists somewhere near Joel.
