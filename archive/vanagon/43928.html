Subject: the 75 westy RAN! and i DROVE it!!

my god...

i started it up, exhaust from strange places and all, and just HAD to 
drie it. so i said, oh well, and did. runs like hell, but, it got moving 
quicker than the 68 does w/ only 4th gear...

when i get a chance, i hink i will see if i can determine if a valve is 
sticking, or if i maladjusted the valves...btw, any easy wy to see if 
valve is sticking? just turn engine over byhand and watch the valves?

thats my guess....that means i need another perosn..greaT!


oh, BTW, to whom it may concern, on monday june 10th i will not get any 
email, due to the freenet is moving its machines, so, i dont know if it 
will bounce around and eventually get back to me, or if it will just get 
eaten by that well known monster lurking in the backwaters of the net? hmm..

thanks for all the responses...
