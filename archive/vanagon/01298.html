&gt;Just found this list in rec.autos.vw -- glad to know of it.
&gt;My first question:
&gt;My Vanagon (81 L with 2.2liter Porsche 911T six) keeps breaking the downlinks
&gt;on its front swaybar, and at $65 a pop from the dealer I'm tired of it.  Is
&gt;there an aftermarket swaybar for the Vanagon?

here's the guy in california that kinda specializes in putting porsche engines
into vanagons and buses. you might check with him (he has a Syncro with a
2.8liter engine in it ... calls it the Range Panzer).
