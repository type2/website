Kirk,

The book says that this system must be power bled.  However, I rplaced the clutch slave and managed to manually bleed it the way you seem to be trying to.  

1) Be sure the resevoir is kept full during the process.

2) Be persistent.  I only got a tiny bit of air the first 25 
   clutch strokes.  It probably took 50 strokes to do the whole 
   job!


Mike
