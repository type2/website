Howdy,
When I start up my van in the morning, I sense only 3 pistions are
firing.  When I rev it a  little, it's even more obvious not all 4
pistons are firing.

After a while everything seems ok and runs really well when it's a warmed
up.  This shouldn't be the case if everything is working right.  That
much I know.

I have new plugs, cap, new temp sensor.  Can't seem to figure what's
acting up?  I have about 100K on the motor and it's still strong.

Any heads up on this?

Thanks,
Jack
