Subject: Re: Pushrod tubes and N&amp;D Automotive

&gt;Sorry about the missing subject in my previous message.  I also  
&gt;forgot to provide N&amp;D's phone number.  It is:  (905) 625-9393.  The  
&gt;person I dealt with is Andy Starzynski.

at $35-45 per tube, this is near $400 all in for parts, and you are going to
need to pull rockers/rods to install. I'd seriously consider the $6 fixed
tubes and redo the entire set by dropping the heads.  A new head gasket is
$30, and doing one side at a time will take 2 weekends. Plus you get to swap
out the hardened old gaskets and inspect the heads.  Do the passenger side
first, it's easiest.  If you are only replacing a single tube, then the
collapsable ones are well worth it, but then again, maybe a dab of JBWeld
will work too.   Tim Smith
