Subject: Re: CS diesel block with turbo-charger

Gary,  to answer your questions

&gt;   Do I understand you correctly, that you have added Quantum
&gt; intake and exhaust manifolds together with the turbocharger, to your
&gt; 48 horsepower, CS diesel long block? ? ?

   Yes, I am hoping VW's over-engineering will allow this abuse.  In the
early 80's there were several after market turbo kits for the diesels and
at according to car magazine reports of the time the kits worked well. Also,
I installed boost, exhaust gas temperature, and oil temperature gauges
to keep track of things.

&gt;       Have you had your Vanagon out for a prolonged drive at say
&gt;60 mph (100 kph) ?  Any compression or ring problems to date?

    I have had it setup this way for about a year and put 10-12k miles on it
with no ill effects yet.  During a trip the past summer from California to 
Oregon, climbing the long steep grades _at_ 90 F outside temp., the rear main
seal 
decided to start a messy leak.  Luckily the rate of the leak was only a quart
per 
400mi. so we were able to continue the trip.  When I pulled the transmission
out,
the seal appeared just worn out, the worst thing was the pilot bearing was
dust and filings and the mainshaft badly worn.  I am guessing that there was
not any grease in the bearing when the engine was installed.  
I think this was due to happen and is independent of adding the turbo. 

After this repair the only oil leak is at the valve cover, timing belt end.
 I think
the cover is bent causing this slight leak.  The only problem related to
adding
the turbo is, the first muffler I had , broke the brackets a couple times.

Some questions about your 82 van if you don't mind

Does your 'van have a complete quantum engine?
If so, how is the air filter connection made?
How is the turbo oil drained? hoses, fittings etc.
Do you have a problem with the boost enrichment diaphram on the injection
pump hitting the engine compartment lid?

A general question to any diesel informed reader
   VW has made a 1.9 td for a couple of years now, and I have seen new
longblocks
   advertised for sale.  Has anybody installed this motor into a Vanagon?
