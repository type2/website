Subject:  Re: Coolant Refill Bottle

&gt;That's funny I just wanted to make a post about loss of coolant, and
&gt;there were several post to day on the subject.
&gt;Check the rear heater core, said one. Under the rear seat. But my car
&gt;only has a front seat so what would it mean to that type of car? What is
&gt;a core? Same as hose or tube?

In Swedish: core = &quot;Radiator&quot;. You have one in the front, perhaps
none in the back. Only the newer Caravelles have two.

&gt;My car drinks about 1 litre per 100 kilometres. (we're metric over here,
&gt;approx 1 pint of water per 35 miles)

A common and unfortunately expensive problem is head gasket failure.
Drive the car until warm. Park on a cardboard (pappkartong) or similar.
Watch for a while. Stop engine. Watch under for maybe 30 min. This 
catches some external leaks. (Large) front heater core, valve and hose
leaks can sometimes be seen by looking under the dash (instrumentbrada) 
on the passenger side.

&gt;Also could someone fill me in on the right pressure for the tyres.
&gt;Metric or not, I'll figure it out. Waterboxer, 2.0 litre engine, gas,
&gt;1984, yellow...

Pressures are different for different busses. Depends on type
of van (ie weight of interior, how wide rims/tires etc.).
Mine is 45 psi front 50 psi rear.

Can you answer a couple of questions for me? I may be moving to
Denmark shortly and wonder:

How much does a mid 80's Transporter or Caravelle cost?

How much is registration? Tax? Insurance?
Is the taxes a lot higher on a big car like the Caravelle
than a small car? Cheaper for a transporter because it's a
work vehicle? (this is the case in Sweden)

Halsningar,
Martin (Swede exiled in USA) and VW Westfalia (Perhaps to immigrate to Europe)
