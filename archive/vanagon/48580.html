Subject: OXS light

Where is the switch for the OXS light on an '87? Also does anyone know of a
good source for seat covers including the center jump seats? I have been
talking to Jim at Busboys  and he keeps promising to send some info and
fabric samples but I haven't seen anything yet and it has been almost two
months.
