&gt; Actually, instead of the second alternative, go buy what is called an
&gt; Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS).  Normally, this plugs into the wall and
&gt; your computer plugs into it.  What it does is pass 120VAC through (usually
&gt; filtering out spikes as well) and also keeps an internal 12VDC sealed lead
&gt; acid backup battery charged.  When the power goes out (120VAC power failure),
&gt; the UPS senses this and immediately draws power from it's internal battery,
&gt; converts it to 120VAC and feeds your computer.  Usually the battery is
&gt; relatively small, because it only is supposed to give you a short time to
&gt; quickly stop what you are doing and implement an orderly shut-down of your
&gt; computer.  If you get a UPS that  you can verify accepts 12VDC as an input
&gt; from it's internal battery, and choose one that is rated to support a full up
&gt; desk top configuration, (big power loads like monitor, hard drives etc) it
&gt; should be able to run a lap top for an extended time without overtaxing the
&gt; 12VDC =&gt; 120VAC electronics if you replace the 12VDC internal battery with
&gt; power from your car battery. 

I have heard that mt UPS's are 24 volts inside.  I was thinking about
this option as well, before I bought the one from Damark
(1-800-827-6767, Al).  With the price of the 600 watter ($200) there was
no need to figger out the UPS.  The &quot;Power Anywhere&quot; 600 watt inverter I
have (says 1kw surge, yar right) is adequate for most things.  It can
run a good sized power drill, jigsaw, trouble light, coffee warmer, and
lots of small things.  Not all at the same time.  If you want to run a
hair dryer (but why?), microwave, or anything that uses lots of heat,
definately get the 1500/3000 watt model, if your batteries can handle
it.
