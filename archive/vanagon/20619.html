Subject: Talk about anal!

I know this sounds anal, but here goes.  Yesterday I added Dura Lube
Fuel System Cleaner to my gas tank.  I noticed a huge decrease in
fuel consumption and much better acceleration.  The problem(?)
is that I &quot;sort of&quot; smell gas.  I'm sure its me that's causing the 
odor.  Is this a problem, because it's not leaking gas(yet).
It just seemed strange to smell gas instead of oil like I usually smell.
