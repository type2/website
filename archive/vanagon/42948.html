Subject: Re: Propane Regulator Safety

Steve Johnson asks:

&gt;So what makes the square valve safer than the round one?

The square style regulator has the second stage incorporated into the
regulator assembly itself - less chance for any leaks and/or problems.  The
round style regulator had its second stage valve attached separately to the
round regulator via a fitting.  Never heard of the fitting leaking, so my
guess is the Feds were being a little paranoid.....which they seem to do a
good (or bad) job of it :-).  Besides, the round regulator design is ancient
and may be adequate for stationary usage (We use 4 of 'em for our propane
tanks here at the shop), but IMHO may not be for the constant jarring it gets
when bounced around in road travel.
