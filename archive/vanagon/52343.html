&gt;Howdy and Help,
&gt;
&gt;I just replaced the head gasket on my 82 diesel.  I didn't have the
&gt;tools that were shown in the Bentley. I tried to keep from moving the
&gt;crank, camshaft, or the pump...but things happen.  I set the engine to
&gt;TDC and the camshaft, IMHO, was properly set (I didn't put a valve thru
&gt;a cylinder).  
&gt;
&gt;The injector pump was a different story. The pulley didn't have a clear
&gt;mark for alignment.  There were several dents around the pulley and they
&gt;each looked about the same. I took my best WAG and set the belt. The
&gt;engine turns over and over and over...  No real combustion but there is
&gt;exhaust smell being produced.
&gt;
&gt;Is there any help for me or my diesel??

&gt;Its not the speed limit I worry about, its the minimum!!!

In order to correctly set the valve timing and injector pump timing you'll
need the tools listed.  Diesel injection pumps are very sensitive to timing
adjustments, so when you change the head gasket and realign the drive belt
you'll have to use a dial indicator to set the timing correctly.  It cost me
$90 bucks for the VW tools alone, I adapted a dial indicator that I had and
fabricated a mount to set the timing.  Sorry, but not the normal tools that
you would probably have in your toolbox.
