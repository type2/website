Hi Listmembers:
I saw this listed for sale a few days ago and was curious about why there
would be a VW adapter plate?  I thought that the Corvair motor rotated in the
opposite direction that the VW turns, so one would have to use the Corvair
tranny - hence no adapter plate.  Set me straight on this one.
