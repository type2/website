O.K., this one is probably not the worst I've done, but it's the 
latest... 

Upon arriving at exit 21 on I-78 back from work friday, I took my usual 
back road home.  Normally two- and four-legged deer are the only problem 
in this back road.  Fridaya evening, however, the last portion of it was 
flooded.  I watched an Acura slowly drive into the 60 yard stretch, and 
decided to back out after it only got to 1/3 of the way.

I decided to show the Acura driver what an '87 Vanagon could do, and the 
poor driver's real struggle to back his car out of slushly ice water gave 
me about 5-7 minutes to shut the engine down, let the heads cool.

This is a road that I know.  Judging from the position of the acura and 
the depth of the water around it, I knew that at the deepest (has two 
dips) the water would well above (by about 6 inches) the bumpers.

Strategy: let the Acura driver make it back, maneuver around his car, 
drive througn at constant speed (less than 10 mph) in 1st 
gear, and hope that the air dam plus tha front of the bus will move water 
well enough to keep it from flooding into the engine compartment.

It worked!!! (well, almost).  At the deepest point, the water body piled 
up against the front and some swirls reached the windshield (I had the 
snow/ice chunks lodged in the upper grille to prove it!).  I had some 
intermittent misfiring, which has now gone away.  I also had some water 
come into the step-well at the front bottom of the driver's side door, 
but the passenger side was dry.

Guess what I overlooked:  The accelerator pedal housing, spare tire 
chamber, etc.. were all flooded.  That I night I jumped in the driver's 
seat for a quick trip to the corner store, and the accelerator pedal had 
frozen like a rock!!!

Needless to say, my van has had a 1500-W portable heater underneath it 
for over 48 hours now, And I was finally able to drive it 15 minutes 
ago.  Well, at least I will be able to make it to work tomorrow...

Enjoy,
Cetin
