Subject: Rocket Notes ('72 Bus)

To All:

Over the past few weeks I've been making friends with the 'Rincon
Rocket, a 1972 VW bus mentioned in an earlier post.  My
observations may be of interest to early bus owners and anyone
contemplating buying a bus.  


Digging In

This is new territory for me, the first Type IV-powered bus I've
ever worked on.  My only in-vehicle experience with the Type IV
engine is based on minor repairs to a few 411's and 914's.  I've
assembled several Type IV's for use in light airplanes but
there's very little common ground between an aircraft engine and
a bus.

Heating

Perhaps the most significant difference between the Type IV and
upright engines is the cabin heating.  Uprights use waste heat
from two cylinders to provide warm air to the cabin, whereas the
Type IV uses all four cylinders.  In theory, this should double
the potential heat available.

The late model bus has an auxiliary heater blower to force air
through the heat exchangers even at low engine speed.  The
auxiliary blower is mounted in the engine compartment and draws
air from that space.  One of the first modifications I plan for
the bus is to install a duct that will allow the auxiliary blower
to draw its air from the cabin, converting the system in a
recirculation heater instead of the present open-loop.

The auxiliary heater blower has an unusual electrical circuit, in
that power to the blower motor depends on the state of the
alternator's output, apparently shutting off the blower whenever
the alternator's speed drops below the charging point.  I say
apparently because while the circuit is clearly shown on the
schematic, the function of the various relays is not.  

Ease of Maintenance

When it comes to maintaining a Volkswagen bus, 1971 and earlier
buses win hands down.  On the Type IV engine, changing spark
plugs, adjusting the valves or replacing the points is orders of
magnitude more difficult than with an upright engine.  This is no
doubt reflected in the Flat Rate Handbook.

I see this as another example of the many ways in which
Volkswagen abandoned its founding principles and in so doing,
destroyed the efforts of the post-WWII VW management team
 to develop a
stong base of loyal customers and along with it, the invaluable
 network of dealers supporting them.  Those of you who did not
personally experience the Volkswagen phenominon will not be able
to understand this.  It probably strikes you as another geezer's
tale of 'the good old days.'  But consider this:  You would think
that when introducing a new powerplant, the manufacturer would
make considerable effort to insure periodic maintenance could be
performed quickly and accurately at minimum cost.  But with their
dysfunctional computerized diagnostic system, obscure fuse panel
and buried distributor, Volkswagen did exactly the opposite,
making later-model buses more difficult to work on and thus more
expensive to maintain than the vehicle it was meant to replace. 
Whatever the mechanical merits of the the vehicle, if higher
maintenance costs are not offset by greater utility, the new
design must be judged a failure.

You can get a feeling for what I'm talking about by simply
comparing the effort needed to do the same task on early versus
late buses.  If you do not presently own a bus, tracking down
examples of each and proving this for yourself is an exercise
worth considering.

(By comparison, when you open the hood of the typical Toyota or
Nissan, you will find all of the periodic maintenance items
within arm's reach and at a convenient level.  Such things do not
happen by accident.) 

With regard to major maintenance items, things best done with the
engine out of the vehicle, I found the Type IV engine a tight
fit, it's removal made more difficult than necessary by being
unable to remove the rear body panel.  But after several
thoughtful if greasy hours laying under the Rocket, I believe it
will be possible to replace the existing panel with one that
bolts in place.  Indeed, were it only an appearance item, the
task would be trivial, but on the later buses the rear panel
forms a structural member that contributes to the strength of the
frame in the area where the rear bumper attaches.  Even so, its
conversion to a demountable panel appears to be a do-able thing.

The Type IV engine with its aluminum crankcase, bigger heat
exchangers and more complex shrouding is nearly twice the weight
of an upright engine.  Aside from that, it's removal and
installation is about the same, with the later-model heater ducts 
being a bit easier to dismount and install.

Dropping the Type IV engine resulted in an amusing problem.  On
the upright engine the upper mounting bolts are concealed from
view behind the blower housing, requiring you to develop a
procedure for loosening them by touch alone.  In the 1972 bus
with its dual-carb Type IV engine, the upper mounting bolts were
right there in plain view yet I spent more time unfastening them
than I would have spent on an upright engine.  This was probably
a dual-feedback phenominon.  My hands kept trying to unfasten an
invisible nut while my brain kept yelling 'There it is!  Unbolt
that sucker!'  My solution was to shut my eyes :-)

Electrical System

The later bus has a more complex electrical system.  Alas, it is
rather poorly thought out, with the fuse block tucked well up
behind the instrument panel where it is not only difficult to see
but almost impossible to work on.  It needs to be moved to a
location that will allow normally jointed humans to inspect and
replace the fuses.  

The 'Rocket' is fitted with a gee-whiz diagnostic system based on
1960's technology that consists of a mare's nest of wires leading
to a test plug.  But to be useful, you need the diagnostic computer
and the card that programs it for your particular Volkswagen.

As I recall, even when new the computerized diagnostic system did
not work reliably.  Indeed, I don't know of any local Volkswagen
dealer that has such a device.  Accordingly, I plan to remove the
diagnostic system's circuits.  But since the diagnostic circuits
are loomed with the other wiring, I'll probably end up re-wiring
the entire aft part of the vehicle.  This is not as impractical a
chore as it sounds since the quarter-century old wiring is not in
especially good condition and would require extensive rewiring in
either case.  Better to do it over completely.

While the overall electrical system is more complex than in
earlier buses, the differences are a matter of detail, such as
additional lights, three blowers, more warning circuits dictated
by unenforceable consumer-protection laws and so forth.  By
contrast, the engine's electrical system is virtually unchanged. 
Indeed, the basic system, and its problems, is the same as with
earlier buses, as are the cures needed to insure
reliability.

I've found it most convenient to install a separate fuse and
distribution panel in the engine compartment, as I've done with
my 1965 bus.  This results in a much neater engine room and a
less cluttered installation.  The fewer wires running about, the
more reliable the system.  The new distribution panel allows me
to install compartment lights and a utility power outlet, while
the failure-prone in-line fuses for back-up lights, blower and so
forth are replaced by circuit breakers mounted on the new
distribution panel, which also incorporates a local ignition and
starting circuit, very handy when performing maintenance.

Marvelous Brakes

One clear advantage of later buses is their power-assisted front
disk brakes and composite rear drums.  

The power assist is conservative by modern-day standards,
offering about a 2:1 pedal pressure advantage.  But when coupled
with front disk brakes the small advantage is more than enough to
give you tire-smoking stops.

The vacuum canister is evacuated by a line running to the intake
manifold below the carb(s) and maintenance involves only an
occasional inspection of the hoses.

While dismantling the brake system I discovered that neither the
brake rod clevis nor the brake pedal pivot is fitted with sleeves
or lubrication points.  Lack of sleeves means the thing is going
to be difficult to repair when it wears, while lack of
lubrication fittings guarantees that it will.  That isn't to say
those features were found on earlier buses, but given the
importance of the braking system, I find their omission on a
supposedly re-engineered vehicle very curious.  I assume it's
another example of the profit maximization pattern of management
that has lead Volkswagen to its present third-rate status as an
automobile manufacturer.

I plan to bush the clevis and replace the stock brake pivot bolt
with one having a Zerk fitting.

Disk brakes were an option on 1970 buses, made standard equipment
the following year.  With the more easily maintained upright engine, yet
fitted with disk brakes, in my opinion the 1971 bus is the best of the 
breed when it comes to late-model buses.

Conclusion

One bus doesn't make a fleet.  It's possible I'm trying to view a
parade through a knot-hole.  Your feedback on my observations
would be appreciated.
