so Steven says: 
I know it hurts now, but I'd try to hang on to it despite what happened,
it still can and should be restored (as close as possible, of course).
It's still a respectable vehicle and rather than let some kid chop it
up and make it look like a 'piece of shit', I'd restore it anyway.

It's up to you...

bucks to put her back to where she should be
