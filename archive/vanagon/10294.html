Subject: RE: WESTY TENTS

Hi everyone:

sorry to shout in my subject heading, but i have a westy tent that i would
REALLY like to find an instruction manual for! Specifically, my tent came
off of a 75' Westy, and it is that yellow canvas model with the blue and
red front door. This particular tent is a &quot;stand alone&quot; model, i.e. it is
freestanding.

If anybody has a Westy tent instruction manual (Joe Clark are you
listening? :)   for a 75' Westy tent I would very much like to get a copy
of it. I think the tents for the Westy's didn't change much from 68' to
79', so the instruction manuals would be the same. Also if you have
instruction manuals for ANY Westy tent i'd like to see a copy please!
E-mail direct and I'll get back to you. I would be able to return the
favour via. covering postage, photocopying expenses or whatever, or just
send you copies of what I have. see previous post today for some of the
literature i have today for type II's

michael
