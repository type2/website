From: Richard Kurtz &lt;rmk_at_worldnet.att_dot_net&gt;
Subject: Bob Hoover's Kansas City Run

Since Bob has posted his latest run, I have taken the liberty to add it 
to the Bob Hoover Sermon Pages.

Either visit the Sermon Page

http://www.sky_dot_net/~rmk/hoover/

and look for the link or go directly to it

http://www.sky_dot_net/~rmk/hoover/KCRunFile/

Bob's latest sermons should be added to ther Sermon page in the next few 
days.
