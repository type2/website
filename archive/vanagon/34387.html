Subject: '71 Campmobile FS

Ivan the FLAPS guy has a '71 Campmobile for sale:

1600 engine from '70 beetle
needs carb work, has good body, sink &amp; fridge, nice interior, lots of new
parts
asking $2000  (sounds like he'd come down considerably if you're really
interested)

this is all I could get at the time, his manager was giving him the evil
eye...

I have his message number in Sonoma County, CA.  Contact me if you are
interested, I'll pass it on to you.

Ruthie
'75 Westy
