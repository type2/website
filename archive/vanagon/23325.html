Subject: Type III Trucks

I'm starting to look for a vehicle to use both as a vehicle to carry things
as well as to satisfy my urge to get back into air-cooled VWs (last one was
a Ghia in '79.

What's the availability of the type 3 pickup trucks?  What are they going
for?  Is there a list for them anywhere?
