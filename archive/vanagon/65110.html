Jim:
Checked our 85 AFM, measured 561ohms between 3&amp;4. FWIW 2.3kohms in
parallel to 740 will produce the requisite 560 ohms. I know there is a
schematic for the AFM but can not locate. I will keep looking. On page
24.28 it is stated that 500 to 1000 ohms is OK. This confuses me because
I also have seen that 560 ohm spec somewhere.
Good Luck

&lt;SNIP&gt;.  Pop the connection to the AFM and test the AFM according to
&gt;Bentley and find that terminals 3 &amp; 4 show 740 ohms instead of the
&gt;specified &quot;approximate&quot; 560 ohms.  Pop the top of the AFM - looks
&gt;pretty clean inside, no carbon tracking (it's the original, never
&gt;replaced), so I can't make a judgement call on that alone, but
&gt;resistance is high at 740 ohms anyway.
