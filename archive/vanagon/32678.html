Subject: Re[2]: Braking for Possum (it's Friday!)

     
     
     
     as for possum and other delicacies-
     
     I think a mod is in order.  I keep my spare tire on the roof, and have 
     welded a rod onto the spring/clip that holds the spare tire plate in 
     place. (where the spare tire should be under the front).   While 
     tooling along I push down on the rod enabling me to scoop/capture 
     anything hanging out in the road - live or dead. 
     
     It works better at night when the critters are captivated by the beam 
     of approaching head lights.   It also means you don't have  to be 
     bothered by having to stop and git out.
