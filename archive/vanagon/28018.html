Subject: Re: Head gasket sealent

&gt;I know this subject has been hashed over in this forum before But for us
&gt;latecomers what is the name of the sealent used to seal leakey headgaskets
&gt;and where can I get some?  Do you have to drop the engine to use it or just
&gt;put a bead around the outside of the heads?

I'm assuming (careful) that you mean the sealant you need to do the repair
correctly,and not just a quick fix? If so, the only sealant to be relied
upon is the stuff that comes with the VW gasket sets. You need to
disassemble the engine (and perform many other operations) to do this
correctly. I would not recommend anyone put Bar's Leaks or any other sealer
of this type in their coolant.

Yours,
