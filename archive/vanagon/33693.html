Subject: Idiot faktor

Well, let me see.  I have so many to choose from...oh yeah.  I bought my '79
Bust from my roommate.  He wanted a bus but never wanted to have to fix it.
The PPO had replaced all sorts of FI stuff but never found the problem --
bus still didn't run right.  He even tried to sell it to someone else but
that fell through.  So, I got it.  It came with the Idiot book.  I read it.
Good humor.  My roommate and I even tried to statically time the bus.  &quot;It's
at TDC, um, I think.  Which one is #1?&quot;  We timed it to #2.  Next thing I
did was buy the Bentley manual.  Seemed like a good idea.  Then I skipped
all the way to the FI chapter and started troubleshooting.  I assumed that
there weren't any mechanical problems, just fool injection problems.
(footnote:  I still do, duh.)

All right, got my Bentley, I'm reading...sitting in the bus, drinking beer,
thinking I can fix it.  I hit the part about the temp sensor II.  &quot;If this
sensor is toast, the bus will run lousy or won't even start.&quot;  That's gotta
be it!  I look at the engine and sure enough, some idiot has screwed an oil
pressure sensor where the temp sensor should be.  Oh man, this is gonna be
great!  I order a new sensor, screw it in and -- it starts.  My roommate
comes running out of the house with his mouth agape and can't talk.  I of
course think that I am this year's master mechanic and proceed to limp the
bus off of the yard onto the driveway.  Even tried to drive it down the
street but it died and we had to push it back home.

What's the whole point in this you ask?  Well, fast forward about one year.
I didn't do much to the Bust, watched it Rust.  Started actually &lt;reading&gt;
the Bentley and lurking on the Vanagon_at_lenti list.
I went to Bug Out 3X in Manassas and talked to a guy with a clean '79.  I
looked around and stuff but everything looked pretty much like my bus.  Then
one day I'm looking around the engine compartment trying to will the bus
into running and I noticed the temp sensor II.  Then I looked at &lt;my&gt; temp
sensor II.  Then I tried to find the oil pressure sensor.  Then I grabbed a
bat and start beating myself upside the head.

I always wondered why oil leaked from the temp sensor. &lt;sigh&gt;
