&gt; Locating a generic source for certain VW bearings and seals would be of
&gt; enormous value to subscribers of this list.  Please keep us posted.
&gt; 
This is entirely true but not always of any value, around here
there is a large supplier of bearings called Bearings, Inc. they
sell nearly all US and European made bearings like FAG and others.
There is a rub sometimes, a friend had a Audi 4000 Quattro, a
main bearing in the tranny went, the local VW guru not fearing Bentley
explicit warnings to the contrary, tore into her and found and
removed the bearing causing the difficulty only to find oddly
that it was of US manufacture, Dealer could get the part for $286
FOR 1 BEARING!, so the guy went to Bearings, Inc.  They looked at
it verified they dealt with its manufacturer, tried to get it and
met with, &quot;We only supply that part to 1 automobile maker world wide,
you will have to get the part through them&quot; which they proceeded to do
at a discount but still the guy had to pay $245 for the part.  A
terrible fact of life with 4wd VWs and a big reason I sold my
Quantum Syncro when the box started making intermittent howling
noises.
