Subject: Engine hatch screws
Date: Tue, 11 Jul 1995 12:53:10 -0500 (CDT)

Two of the things I planned on replacing on my '71 bus are the little 
seals around the hinges on the engine lid.  The screws, however, won't
come out.  There is some rust on that lid so I guess the rust is 
inside as well.  I could drill them out and use the extractor but that
would leave me with no replacement screws.  Any ideas on getting them 
out of there without the drill?  If I do have to drill them out does 
anybody know of a source for replacement screws?  Should I forget the 
idea and seal it up from the inside with some sealant or something?  
Thanks, Jim
