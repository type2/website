After reading all of the last postings on hubcaps I've come to the
conclusion that these VW vans, busses, campers or whatever you want to
call them are all prone to lossing one hupcap !  What's the deal ?
Must be some kind of hubcap conspiercy concocted by &quot;Hubcap Annie&quot; so's
they can sells us some hubcaps  -  yea that's it !

Cheers,

Frank
