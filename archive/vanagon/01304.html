Subject: Changing started without pulling tranny

Baul Bjork sent this to me, but I suspect he was thinking the list would 
help.

&quot;
This brings up another question. Has anybody ever changed a starter 
in a Syncro without taking out the tranny? If they have, would they 
like to do another one. $600.00+ parts and labour at the the FLARS.

Later... Paul.
