Subject: Rustoleum is our friend...

The Bozobus is covered (nearly all of him) with Rusty Metal Primer and then
a top coat of (it depends upon where on him) Rustoleum Aluminum Fence Paint
or the aerosol can version of Allis-Chalmers Safety Orange.  I sandblasted
almost all of the original (rusty) Dove Blue off of the outside of him.

The body bump and nose are orange. Below the bump is Sea Green fence paint
and above the bump is Sky Blue (or some approximation).

This paint is now 12 years old and never been waxed.  It's starting to
break down, but I think this longevity is pretty good for a non-baked
finish.  Of course, it was never what you'd call &quot;shiny&quot;, but I prefer
function over form...
