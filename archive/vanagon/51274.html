Subject: Vanagon Oil Filler

With all this talk about easy access to the oil filler, I thought I'd 
add my tip of the day.  I drilled a small hole in the hinge bracket 
for the license plate and inserted a small clip.  The clip is one of 
those thingamajings that I don't know the name of off hand, but I 
have seen them used to connect tubing together.  It has one 
straight side and the other is shaped to go around the tube.  Any 
way, I pull the clip out when I pull down the license plate to 
check the oil, and reinstert the clip when the plate is down.  That 
holds it in place and I have one less thing to hold on to while 
pouring oil down the filler tube.
