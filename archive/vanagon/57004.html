Subject: &quot;Bottom-O-List&quot; Candidate - Chicago

Hi Folks, Particularly those who may be in ChicagoLand.

Family circumstances caused me (allowed me the opportunity) to be in the
Chicago community this past weekend.

While ther I had to make a trip or two for supplies in the area.

As is my habit, I spotted a VW Dealer and opted to stop and spend some
time to &quot;scope-out&quot; the place.

W E L L - I have a new dealer to add to be bottom of my All-Time
Favorite VW Dealer List.

	HAGGERTY VW  -  GMC
	located near Cicero &amp; (about) 95th Street

After wandering around the lot for a time, I went into the office area;
I did not see a VW van anywhere. There were GMC vans parked literally up
to the entranc door of the VW (clearly marked with PROM material)
section.

I was greeted by a gentlman wearing a name-tag that identified him as a
&quot;VW Sales Manager&quot;.

I asked about the availability of a new VW van through is dealership.

His response,
	&quot;Van, you mean a Volkswagen van?
My Response, &quot;Yes&quot;
His response, &quot;I'm not certain they (VW) are making them any more.
		If they are made, they certainly are not imported
		into the United States.&quot;
My Response, &quot;They ARE being manufactured and ARE being sold by delaers
		in the United States.&quot;
His response, &quot;Well, I don't thing you are going to find one in
		the Chicago area. Certainly not at this dealership.
		Besides, we can give you a much better deal on a GMC van.
		You ARE looking for a van to purchase, aren't you.&quot;
My response, &quot;I'm looking for a VW van.&quot;
His response, &quot;If you mean a camper, then maybe you should check out one
		of the RV dealers in town.&quot;

As I started listing facts and details, I know abolut the van, one could
easily see the embarrased look on the salesman's face.

My response, At any rate, what's the procedure to get some service-work
		done here on a VW van?&quot;
His response, &quot;Well we don't do much of that. In fact we have a
	VW mechanic who is here one day a month. If you leave your van
	a couple days before the mechanic arrives we'll try to schedule
	the work.&quot;
My response, &lt;EXIT, STAGE LEFT, WITH VISIBLE FRUSTRATION&gt; ...
	never to return to this dealer.

I don't think I'd trust this dealership for ANYTHING related to a VW!!!

Submitted FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH!!!!

Regards
