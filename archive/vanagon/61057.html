Empty ones, yeah......but if you look for loaded ones, some of them are 
excellent...better than anything else i've seen..

I once was behind a flatbed that had a LOAD of sheetsteel...stuck out 
about 2 feet off each side of the trailer, but was shorter than a normal 
cargo trailer....and only sat at the very rear of the truck...we were 
doing right between the M and the P on my 69's speedo...(but the speedo 
read 10 mph high!) for over 300 miles, at which point i had to get gas..:)

I got around 30 MPG that time!! 

The thing i liked the BEST was that i was able to see around the truck 
enough to feel comfortable! (and the fact that the &quot;perfect&quot; spot was 30 
or 40 feet back, and JUST fit the bus...) Made for a nice ride..:)

Oh, and i still had plenty of pedal left to work with...:)
