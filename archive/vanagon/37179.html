Subject: Emissions, engine swaps, full-flow filters, 76 balls


	Someone said the catalyst accounts for .1% HC, someone
else said 50% of their engine's actual output. both could be right- .1% HC
is 1000ppm, in other words, a HUGE ammout. .1% *of the limit* would be a
small number, of course. The modern three-way catalyst is a marvel
of applied engineering. Works great, has no moving parts. Only problem
in in lamda systems, with oxygen sensors, the oxygen sensor has
a murder-suicide pact with the cat.- if the oxygen sensor fails, engine
goes to full rich and the cat may melt down, blocking the exhaust flow
and taking a while to troubleshoot. If I ever had time on my hands
I'd probably try to retro-fit my '70 with catalysts, and it probably
wouldn't work, what with the relativly sloppy mixture control even
a good carb has. I figured one-per-bank rather than the cheap two-to-one
deal of the later type IV... Like I have time for this ;)  Maybe I'd just 
have to spring for a type IV with FI :)

	I saw an article about ice-racing where some guy has put a Porsche 911
motor in a Saab Sonnet III FWD sports car... so at least one air-cooled into
a water-cooled chassis has been done...

	Bob writes about poorly fitting full-flow-filter adaptors. How come
nobody imports the spin-on-filter adaptor I saw on a stock beetle engien
at the VW dealer in Tijuana? Does it not fit old cases?

	Finally, Lee, I'll stop at the Union 76 Station on my way home
tonight and see if I can get one of those antenna balls for you. They exist
and are exactly as you describe.

	Work calls!
	Bill
