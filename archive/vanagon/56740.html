Subject: Re: Dead Bus Report

&gt; scanned.  Tom left us soon after the clean-up but Steve and John and I
&gt; went to Generous George's again (this is good stuff, folks) and then I
&gt; headed home.  I was TIRED and slept very well last night.
&gt; 
&gt; A productive weekend.  
&gt;

&gt; --

He was tired?? he didn't have to drive home 3 hours with half a ton 
of bus parts in the back of his vanagon, highest oil temps I have 
ever hit on the Sideling hill grade, 250F for just maybe 30 seconds 
before I got to the top in 2nd at 30mph.

Seriously good report Sean, to make this not sound so pathetic money 
wise I will interject I netted a brand new ANSA 1 piece muffler, 2 
excellent heater boxes, and a bunch of bits and pieces.  The heads 
are in fact in exceptional shape, I do believe that the engine was 
recently rebuilt and well maintained before filling with gasoline 
from a sticking carb float, as there is no wear on the rocker shafts 
and very little or no cam lobe wear.  Crying shame really.  Now to 
figure out how to get the damn thing apart.  I think 2 of the 
cylinders may budge allowing me to split the case? then take off the 
rods and let the pistons and cylinders go with them. Anybody? Anybody? 
Ideas always appreciated.  I also netted a complete '78 FI system 
which is an excellent spare for my '78, or maybe for sale, and 4-5 
NOS VW T1 rebuild gasket kits, one in a 60's?? vintage blue and white 
logo box.  I also have for sale (no reasonable offer refused) two 
very straight and largely rust free '73 front doors, origionally in 
pastel white over African red but now the lower red is a darker 
repaint.  I took these because although they have a minor bit of rust 
on the bottom I once blew 3-4 days bondoing an accident damaged door 
back into shape for the '76, these are pristine as far as accident 
damage goes, complete locks, windows, hell the scrapers are even 
OK for 20+ years old.  Also have a full set of matching locks 
for a '73, no reasonable offer refused with 2 keys.  Many other bits 
and pieces free.  Solid front and rear bumpers, not rusted and rear 
is only slightly bent compared to most, again for reasonable offer.
Anyway, after all I don't like commercialism on the list and I'd hate 
to start making a business of this 8-), anybody interested in anything 
get back with me.  If the tranny and heads work out for Steve, with 
the core worth of the crank and rods if still OK I might just break 
even.
