hey now,

okay, by now everyone knows my saga with cv joints...and battery plates and
what not. here's the story on how i got this van:

My roomate bought this van from a fella who had too many...he really took care
of it. well, kevin felt that it wasn't good for the environment cuz it's an
older vehicle and it's had some modifications from a dual carb to a single
carb. and kevin uses mainly public transportation. so he was going to sell it.
i asked how much. he said $300. i said: &quot;SOLD!&quot;. it's been sitting in the
back yard for a year and a half. the body has a little rust, nothing that can't
be touched up and fixed. the floor is in immaculate condition. the interior
has been taken care of. the engine is a rebuilt 1700 with the above mentioned
carb modifications. i've done some work on the following things:

1) bled the brakes, getting all the nasty fluid out (with help from richard!)
brakes seem to work fine.

2) replaced cv boots and one joint. (still in progess, waiting for parts)

3) made a temporary fix on rusted out battery compartment.

4) tightened up the clutch.

5) checked spark plugs...mixture looks good.

6) changed the oil.

yesterday i got serious and started her up. died 1st time. died 2nd time. ran
a bit 3rd time. died. gave it a little gas the 4th time...it kept going...kept
giving it gas...died. the 5th time caught and it idled great...i'm not an
expert on the sound of a vw engine yet but it sounded great!!!!! let it idle
for awhile...it was a nice smooth idle and got better once it warmed up. no
real fluctations...just a ------------------ idle. i'm pretty amazed that it
runs so well after sitting for 1 1/2 years. okay...hopefully i'll have the
parts i need today in the mail and will slap them on and take it for a spin.

should i do anything else? the belt looks good..it doesn't seem like the carb
needs any adjusting or cleaning. the engine in this van has been babied and
taken care of throught the years. i think that makes a big difference. my plan
for this weekend is to take it to my folk's house, about 1 1/2 hours away and
show them my new vehicle...they should be pleased....;-) (Look honey, our son
IS a Deadhead...he has one of them hippy mobiles..) then over to greensboro,
nc to visit some friends and back home. about 250 miles. this is providing i
get the parts and take her for a test drive and see if i can tell if anything
is wrong.

keepin' my fingers crossed,

jonathan 'who loves his vw sooooo much...and needs to name it he supposes'
