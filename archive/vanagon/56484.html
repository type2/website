Subj:	RE: Engine Conversion

RS:
There's an article on my Porsche-into-Vgon project in the Vanagon archives,
which needs to be updated because I've gone through two more permutations,
upgrading 2.2liter to 2.7liter to 3.0liter, and in the process altering
the engine rear-hanger height to allow use of the stock Porsche exhaust
(which the stock VW crank-center height does not permit.)

The 3-liter Vanagon (and for that matter the 125hp 2.2liter Vanagon) is a
VERY nice van, the performance difference especially noticeable in 3rd
and 4th gears.  It is not a drag-racer, partly because it still has the
stock clutch, and partly because 180hp is only what modern V6 vans are
coming with.  It does correct the lack of power that was the single major
problem of an otherwise great handling and very utilitarian 7 passenger
sports car.  The relative ease of dropping the aircooled six in place of
the aircooled four makes lots of people suspect that there was A Plan
at some point at the factory.
