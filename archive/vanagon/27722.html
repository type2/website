Subject: New seals for slave cylinder?

&gt;Subject: Re: New seals for slave cylinder?

&gt;My '85 is dripping brake fluid from the clutch slave cylinder. I
&gt;thought I might just try replacing the seals. I tried doing this
&gt;several years ago on an old Datsun's brake slave cylinder but it leaked
&gt;soon afterward. Anyone have luck with the cheap approach or should I do
&gt;it right and just buy a new one.

I had *good* luck with rebuilding the slave cylinder a few
years ago.  It went bad *suddenly* when temperatures went
below zero.  New cups et al were less than $50 and new
cylinder was....pushing $200 I think.

So far, so good.
