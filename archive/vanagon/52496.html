and not just using a seat belt, but defensive driving, not driving under 
the influence of whathaveyou, driving carefully, paying attention, 
turning headlights on when raining, and at dusk and dawn &lt;personal peeve 
here..&gt;, driving accourding to conditions, be it your own vehicle's 
condition, the condition of the road, or the condition of you rmind..
and of course, again, just being bloody careful! you know?


.....david

be sure you turn your stinkin lights on! 

&lt;yeah, i'm the guy in the bus flashing his lights at people..:)

...davidoh, and not just your parking lights either bub!
ran a guy off the road just last night, nearly, cuase alll he had was his 
parking lights, around 7 at night, in the rain!!! and was just barely not 
in my blindspot. but, since his little yellow lights blended in so well 
with other traffic, i sorta missed him by about 1 inch....and, of course, 
the idiot still didnt turn his lights on!


i understand geting in the car, driving down a well lit road, and not 
noticing they arent on, but, then you see other cars!! and you would then 
think oops..i guess i forgot my lights, and turn 'em on, you know?

sorry...just had to get rid of that...:)


....david...drive sefely...

&gt;      That's what we need today! WE DON'T NEED MORE COMPUTERS, to do more
&gt;      non-sense. I work on them, (with them) everyday. I am sure in some
&gt;      way one of them will kill us all! Just teach the public how to
&gt;      take care of them self, by using a seat belt. Is that to hard?
&gt;      If people are this dumb, Nothing will help!
