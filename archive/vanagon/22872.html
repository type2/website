The year is 2046.  A little girl  climbs up on the old man's knee and says
&quot;Tell us the buffalo story again, Granpa Kane&quot; and the old man clears his
throat and begins, &quot;Well, let's see now...  It was the summer of '95.  I was
driving my mother across Nebraska.  I was just fourteen but I was already a
pretty good driver and it was good thing, too.  We was in this old thing
called a Volkswagen that took a pretty good driver to handle it, so when this
herd of buffalo starts drifting onto the road...&quot;

And so myths are made, as myths should be made, for myths are good things,
too.
