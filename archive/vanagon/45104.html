So does that mean one can rev the wasserboxer up to 5200 for extended
periods without harmful effects?  Or should a self imposed red line of 4000
or 4500 rpms (or some other rpm) be the rule.  By the way, I am a big
beliver in CW cranks.  I have one in my high performance Air Cooled in my
'71.

&gt;The Engine control computer is set to cut out the fuel at about 5400 rpm.
&gt; The engine will withstand higher speeds for short durations , but why push
&gt;it.  The big problem is the boxer motion coupled with a non counter wieghted
&gt;crank,(counter wieghts and balancing are different issues).  When reeved too
&gt;high, the crank does bend and twist a bit.  This flexing is especially hard
&gt;on the center bearing.
