Subject: Long Life Prestone

I forgot to say thanks to all those list members who offered advice 
over the past year while I got up the courage to attempt the coolant 
change!

One more thing:

I got 2 jugs of Longlife at Walmart, then went back to get one more, 
but it was sold out. I then got another jug a few weeks later, which 
had a different label. Both are longlife Prestone, both say phosphate 
&amp; silicate free, but one is orange, and the other yellowish.

The yellow one has # W-4816-M on the label &amp; says good for 115,000km

The orange one is # P-407-M ands says 160,000 km.

Hmmmm.

I'm assuming one is just old stock, can anyone confirm this?
