Subject:  Wheel Covers

I am looking for 1 or 2 of the 15 hole &quot;aero&quot; style wheel covers that 
John Sharpe gave away earlier in the week.  Unfortunately, I was too 
late.  If anybody has access to 1 or more of these, I'd be very 
interested in purchasing some.  I have not been able to find any in 
the Dallas area except for new ones priced at a whopping $70.00!!!

Thanks in advance,

Greg
