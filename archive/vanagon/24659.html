Somebody previously said:
&gt;&gt; -gary   coyote_at_nando_dot_net  '76 CampMobile  &quot;Rocinante&quot;

but wasn't Rocinate the burro (jackass) that Don Quixote rode around on??? :)

Then on Tue, 12 Sep 95 11:34:49 CDT Tobin T. (tha Bear) Copley retorted:
&gt;myself now as well.  I'm a bear (Not the kind you're probably thinking
&gt;of, Ron, I'm too skinny and hairless to count).  Actually, Christa is

ummmm. down here abouts, we call &quot;skinny and hairless bears&quot; Possums. :)
well, admittedly most of them are hairless cause they have the mange from
eating and messing around in garbage cans ...

&gt;Any other bears, coyotes, or other animals?

well, ursine may be Bear, but my sign is Capricorn (or is it Sagitarius?)
which is the Goat (or is it the Crab??) ... well, no matter. i've been called
an old goat, and i've been called an old crab. but technically, i belong to
the clan of the cave bear ... cause when the days grow shorter, i tend to want
to hibernate. :)

and besides, i'm a omnivore and big enough and hairy enough to be a bear.
not a Grizzly, mind you ... more like a Panda with an attitude. :)
