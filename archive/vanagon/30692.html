Subject: Can I replace my back seats of 84 van with newer seats?  

I have an '84 waterboxer.  I want to take my middle bench out and replace it
with a newer modeled seat that folds down.  Are they interchangeable with no
modifications?  I also want to change out my back bench with a week-ender
back seat.  Is this possible with out any extensive modifications?  Any info
would be great.
Thanks,Fred
It looks like I'm fixing my Van-a-gon.
