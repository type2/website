Subject: Help installtion Aux.battery 1985 westy

&gt;
&gt; Hello Vanagon list, I would like to install a deep cycle aux. Battery
&gt;under the rear seat of a 1985 Westy. I have read that a battery isolator is
&gt;not good,but should use a high amp relay(how high of an amp?). Local RV
&gt;store wants $45 for a battery cut-out relay. Anyone know a cheaper
&gt;alternative? Could you not use, say a 1970's Ford starter relay? (Cost $6).
&gt;Looking at the wiring diagram of a 1986 (Bentley) could you just mount the
&gt;relay under seat or in  engine compartment, use a short battery cable from
&gt;Aux.battery positive to terminal 87 of relay and a 3-4 foot cable ran from
&gt;terminal 30 of relay to terminal 30 on the Starter (would be easier than
&gt;running the cable to the main battery) Splice into the blue alternator
&gt;wire(to dash light) to power relay (term.86) and ground term. 85 of
&gt;relay.Thoughts? Suggestions?

You can get an X-relay, around 15 amps I think, for &lt; $15. This is a std
Bosch part and has all the terminals numbered just as you described.
Mine was for a Rabbit, I don't know what year.
I didn't wire mine up as you describe though - instead I took a parallel
line off the alternator, wired through the relay. Then took a No. 10 wire
from the relay up to the aux battery. I spliced into the alternator light
wire in order to drive the relay.
