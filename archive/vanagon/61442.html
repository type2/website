&gt; Ok, I've been reading the heater talk...here's one that really puts out the
&gt; heat.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a US army surplus multifuel heater that is about a 12&quot; cube, runs on
&gt; 24 volts, has a wall mount thermostat, and runs on gas, diesel, kerosene etc.
&gt; 
&gt; I mounted one in my tugboat, but it could work outside with a piece of dryer
&gt; duct for fast portable heat for campers....15,000 btu! (could also mount
&gt; inside for mobile heat, but it is kind of noisy!)

Hey Ed,

   I went to there WEB page but could not find it, so I sent for 
   a catalog. In the mean time how much did it cost?
