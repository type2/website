Subject: RE: Troubleshooting Overheating...


&gt;Following St. Muir's advice I checked everything he suggests and
&gt;more.  Here's my list thus far of things to check to stop that
&gt;overheating.  PLEASE add to the list.

A few things not on your list, but you may have taken care of already
(bonehead category, which most people know thru common sense but I
had to find out by trial and error):

 - All air hoses in place and secured in the engine compartment?
  This includes both heater hoses AND the preheater hose from
  the center of the tin to the bottom of the air intake. These ca
  all get torn and/or slip off and/or those little metal cans at the
  bottom of the heater hoses can pop out of their holes.

 - If the hoses are NOT in place (some people in warmer states like to
  remove and block off the heater hoses), then make sure the holes in
the tin, right above the muffler, are covered! If they aren't, the engine
will draw VERY warm air from around the muffler, up into the engine
compartment, and try to cool itself with said heated air. Next time around,
the air is even hotter, etc., and the engine literally drowns in its
own heat, even though everythin else is set up ad tuned correctly.
This is where I blew it-- it took some gentle advice from a knowledgeble
listmember who took one look at the engine, to get me to fix about five
things that were wrong.
