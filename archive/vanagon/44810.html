Beware the 6 point versus 12 point socket head cap screws! My son and I 
recently did a change out of a CV boot on our '71bus and found a mixture of 
these two fasteners. The Bow Wow on 196th in Lynnwood (WA) had only 12 
points in stock, so I went down the block to Eagle Hardware and bought some 
6 point replacements for about the same price: 60 cents each I think. The 
grade of the bolt is unknown but  Bow Wow might not be matching the oe grade 
either. I chose to cut them down in length, from 50 to 47 mm as I remember, 
to match what came out. I'm really not convinced this was necessary but I 
was just making sure. By the way, in the poor lighting under the bus we 
managed unknowingly to get the 12 points out with a standard  hex allen 
wrench, but  the sockets were damaged. At times we had to coax them with a 
vicegrip on the cap head. Fortunately, only the boot on our CV needed 
replacing. Access was particularly easy because we had the engine pulled, to 
replace the clutch.
Good luck.
By the way my son attends UW, but he's home for the summer.
