Subject: Re: Rear name badge and a euro-light que


&gt;Hmmm-

&gt;Seems that on one of my trips to Germany in the late eighties, I
&gt;picked up a rear badge for the Westfalia that said &quot;Camping&quot;.  If I
&gt;find it, I might have a &quot;Vanagon&quot; badge to part with.

I'm fine with my own 'CAMPING' badge.

&gt;Do European-market Vanagons have any type of side blinker light just
&gt;aft of the front doors?

NO, there is no Vanagon special. If you like to have some, search
for general propose blinkers.

Vanagons sometimes got turn lights on the rear roof when they are
used as school busses, but this lights are also general propose
and used for the EVs too.
