Subject:      ANNOUNCE: Web Page Improvements

The archive is back, yay! I mean the full type2 list archive, available
from the Busted Bus page on www.type2_dot_com. The interface still needs a
little tweaking and hopefully soon it'll be able to do Booleans, but it's a
nice engine as it sits. Does relevance prioritizing, loads ten hits at a
time like Alta Vista, faster than blazes.

Thanks to Marc Edwards for configuring the engine and giving us the
&quot;obscene amount of disk space&quot; (his remark). Thanks also to Everett Barnes
who hacked the old Listserv file spool format into something an HTTP search
engine can read.

Also the Transporter Trips &amp; Tours page is back: http://www.type2_dot_com/events/

The new Aircooled Events Czar is Debbie Fleming &lt;dfleming_at_moosebird_dot_com&gt;,
please send announcements of any shows or trips to her. She ain't aircooled
but we're okay with that. ;) Debbie has cruised every source she knows
about and come up with a long list of VW events, please send her more.
Thanks Debbie!

On Deck: Josh Rodgers is handling the Reference section. It's going
together now. What we're looking for here is links to technical bus stuff.
Wiring diagrams, tech articles of all sorts (upgrades, mods, restos), hard
cold bus facts that reside on your page or somebody else's. If there's
something you'd like to see included please send it to Josh
&lt;JJRodgers1_at_compuserve_dot_com&gt;. ESPECIALLY we'd love anything with
photographs, we can scan if need be.

In the Hole: Still sniffing for BBTA pictures, send 'em here, folkses.
