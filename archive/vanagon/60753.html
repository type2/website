&gt;&lt;&lt;  Believe me there is a
&gt; market for vanagon (and EV) weekenders. &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I have to agree with this, to many a full on Westy is too much to use as a
&gt;daily driver while the weekender is a good comprise...

I'm a little new at this, so forgive my ignorance.  Weekender is the fold
down rear seat, right?  When we replaced our faithful '73 w/ homemade
camper conversion back in '92, my wife refused to buy a used synco, which I
really wanted, because the back seat didn't fold down.  Instead, we bought
a '91 2WD, which had the fold down seat.  SHE WAS RIGHT.  Wouldn't do
without it.  On long trips, we can drive until we get tired, pull over and
sleep until the sun, (or a passing freight train) wakes us,  and continue
on our way, refreshed.  But I can still haul 4x8 sheets of plywod, etc., or
12' lumber.  A great compromise.  It's one of the many things about the
vanagon that amazes minvan owners.
