Subject:      bumper questions/specifics

Hey all,
OK, I've been doing some bumper research.

I can go two ways here:  get original bumper straightened or get
new/used bumper.

Advantage to fixing old one:  original quality bumper as opposed to
possibly cheap crappy aftermarket ones.

Disadvantage:  can be kinda expensive, maybe more expensive than a good
used one.

What do you all think?  Can anyone give me specifics on price/quality?
I notice motorworks has a bumper for Vanagon for $140.  Bus Depot has a
chrome one for $150 but no holes for impact strip.

I want the impact strip! :-)  In fact, I think my existing impact strip
is actually OK, it's just the bumper that's toast.  I plan to re-use it.
Should I get new clips for it or re-use the old ones?

I'm also gonna need new end caps, I suppose that will be fairly easy to
get a hold of.

I could always go new bumper from the dealer, but that might be
punishing the poor guy who hit me too much :-)

Please, opinions needed.  I don't want to buy a used one sight unseen
unless I know it's in really good shape (mine was in excellent shape).
I also don't want to buy a new one if the chrome is crappy and it's
gonna rust in six months.

Sean
