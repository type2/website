Subject: Mirrors &amp; speakers work!

Well, I finally got around to replacing the cracked wires in the 
drivers door opening. Now both power mirrors work, and my stereo is 
now stereo again... Had to replace most of the wires due to corrosion 
inside the insulation.

So if anyone has problems with mirrors, or front door speakers, check 
the wiring inside the drivers door rubber boot.

ps: Is the list working? Haven't seen anything since last night.
