&gt;     Sorry you did not hear a direct response from listmembers.

&gt;     After Bob Hoover's eloquent writings on rust, everyone else was
&gt;     probably afraid to post, fearing literary humiliation. Check the
&gt;     archives, or the Sermons at http://www.sky_dot_net/~rmk/hoover/ .

So how does Bob H's sermon compare to the FAQ: Rustoration written by
Ed Delaney?  Personally, I believe that two nice references are better
than one.  I guess I should read them both, but I'm definately out of
my league here.  I'm sure Thom Fitzpatrick will lead me down the path
of rust-free righteousness.  ;)
