Subject: Re: '82 diesel Injector Pump timing symtoms?

&gt;         I am trying to decide if I need to use (read buy) the dial guage to
&gt; retime the injector pump correct the proublem that I am having.  So, to the
&gt; people that have used the guage to retime ther diesels, what were the
&gt; symptoms of an out of time engine injector pump? (the flywheel TDC bump, the
&gt; camshaft notch, and the injector locking pin all line up)
I've never had to use one, although my father in-law has one which 
should work. I suspect timing is not your problem here though.
 
This:
&gt;         Based on advise I recieved as a response to this, I replaced the
&gt; seal behind the pulley on the injector pump.  This helped a lot, but I can
&gt; not get the van over about 45mph.

Combined with this:
&gt; (Hornbrook CA to Klamathon).  I tried running with a diferent set of
&gt; injectors (out of a TD, I dicovered that the injectors for the TD are
&gt; difrent than the nonTD injectors, the TD injectors are rated at 155bar and
&gt; the normal injectors are rated at 130bar).  It seemed to run about the same,
&gt; but a bit noiser for some reason.

suggest to me the pump and/or injectors are the problem. My Jetta TD 
idles and drives much quieter than the original non-Turbo engine. The 
fact that the TD injectors are noisier though, suggests to me that 
maybe your old ones are releasing pressure too soon (or the pump is 
not functioning properly with them), resulting in a sort of &quot;staged&quot; 
ignition, which would be quieter, much like the system used in the 
TDI.

Just a few thoughts; those two statements stood out as being odd to 
me...
