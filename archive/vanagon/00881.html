&gt; 
&gt; Quick question.  I have an '80 vanagon which recently
&gt; passed Virginia emissions with flying colors.  I am moving
&gt; to Sacramento, CA in two months.  I am assuming I may
&gt; run into some trouble concerning CA's emissions standards.
&gt; Are these standards set across the board for the state or are
&gt; they left up to county, city, etc...?  What adjustments/enhancements
&gt; may I need to make to my exhaust to get my baby to pass?
&gt; Any help appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; 

Welcome to my stomping ground Joseph.  Are coming here to work or
go to school.  Either way, California is not cheap.  The smog require
ment is now State wide.  I don't yet know the differences between
smog equipment in California and the rest of the Union but I'll look
them up in the Bently and let ya know what I can determine.

Hope we can do some VW campin' together sometime.  Also, I suspect
Martha Rubin on this mailing list might be able to give you some
tips on the smog deal as well.  She also has an '80 I believe.
