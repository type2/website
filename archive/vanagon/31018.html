Subject: Convincing MYSELF

Last night at a Christmas party, a gathering of old College chums, the
conversation wandered around to VWs and Vanagons (of course). A buddy's wife
mentioned that they have a 1980 or 81 Vanagon &quot;just sitting along side of
the house.&quot; Hmmm... She went on to say that everyone that has offered to
&quot;haul it away&quot; would only give them $150 for it. I could have it fo rthat
price. They would be thrilled to clean up the property. I swung by and
looked at it this AM on the way in to work. It is very oxidized but straight
as a pin, four deflated tires, looks like the sliding door latch needs
adjustment as it appears to have been left open by 2&quot; or so. I supposedly
&quot;ran fine when we parked it&quot; but needed brakes and the A/C unit over the
front driver/passanger broke. They supposedly didn't have the $$, time, or
skills to fix it. Interior is a little tattered but there. Has all four fake
mag hubcaps in great shape. 
Questions:
1. License plate was expired in Jun 93. How would the engine be affected by
sitting so long?
2. Are there any inherent problems that may have affected the FI or fuel
pump by sitting  so long?
3. Could the tires (with amazingly good tread) be ruined by sitting so long?

I would be looking at a &quot;make it run and turn it quick&quot; situation or part it
and haul it off. Even though the light blue over darker blue is rather
&quot;fugly&quot; it would seem a shame to part something so complete. If the engine
runs fine and I decide to part it I might steal the 2.0 air motor for the
single cab =))

4. What problems would I encounter converting the FI to dual carbs? How do
the T4 heads match up to T2 carb manifolds? I have some bigger Kadrons on
the shelf. I remember that the 914 2.0s occasionally were retro fitted to
carbs...

Sorry for the potenially lame questions. I DO intend to do my own research
but thought I could think out loud in your direction.

Any suggestions? Your help is appreciated! 
Happy Holidays Everyone
