Subject: Recycled BUGS Phone Number Wanted

I seem to have lost my catalog from the Recycled BUGS place
in Deerborne (?) Michigan. If somebody out there had the number,
could you please send it to me?
(OK, I know that they are not Recycled BUGS anymore, just
RECYCLED ^$_at_*), VW can sue me.

Just please send me a phone number. Thanx.
