Subject: Re: Yum, yums!

My God! Those are some expensive cookies... your story has earned the
DIVINE WIND award and will appear in the February Edition of
VOLKSADDICT...(along with the cookies, of course...)


&gt;The attached file has a really yummie cookie recepie, i tried pecans,
&gt;hazlenuts and macadamia (in separate batches).  The story of how the recepie
&gt;was obtained is pretty humerous.
&gt;
&gt;Hopefully, this isn't a copyright infringement.
&gt;
&gt;enjoy,
&gt;Fred
&gt;
&gt;

&gt;Okay, everyone....a true story of justice in the good old U.S. of A.
&gt;Thought y'all might enjoy this; if nothing else, it shows internet
&gt;justice, if it can be called that.
&gt;
&gt;My daughter &amp; I had just finished a salad at Neiman-Marcus Cafe
&gt;in Dallas &amp; decided to have a small dessert.  Because our family are
&gt;such cookie lovers, we decided to try the &quot;Neiman-Marcus Cookie&quot;. It
&gt;was  so excellent that I asked if they would give me the recipe and they
&gt;said with a small frown, &quot;I'm afraid not.&quot;  Well, I said, would you let
&gt;me
&gt;buy the recipe? With a cute smile, she said, &quot;Yes.&quot;  I asked how much,
&gt;and she responded, &quot;Two fifty.&quot; I said with approval, just add it to my
&gt;tab.
&gt;
&gt;Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement from Neiman-Marcus and
&gt;it was $285.00.  I looked again and I remembered I had only spent
&gt;$9.95 for two salads and about $20.00 for a scarf.  As I glanced at the
&gt;bottom of the statement, it said, &quot;Cookie Recipe - $250.00.&quot;  Boy, was I
&gt;upset!! I called Neiman's Accounting Dept. and told them the waitress
&gt;said
&gt;it was &quot;two-fifty,&quot; and I did not realize she meant $250.00 for a
&gt;cookie recipe.
&gt;
&gt;I asked them to take back the recipe and reduce my bill and they
&gt;said they were sorry, but because all the recipes were this expensive
&gt;so not just everyone could duplicate any of our bakery recipes....the
&gt;bill would stand.
&gt;
&gt;I waited, thinking of how I could get even or even try and get any of
&gt;my money back.
&gt;
&gt;I just said, &quot;Okay, you folks got my $250.00 and now I'm going
&gt;to have $250.00 worth of fun.&quot; I told her that I was going to see to it
&gt;that every cookie lover will have a $250.00 cookie recipe from
&gt;Neiman-Marcus for nothing. She replied, &quot;I wish you wouldn't do this.&quot; I
&gt;said, &quot;I'm sorry but this is the only way I feel I could get even,&quot;
&gt;and I will.
&gt;
&gt;So, here it is, and please pass it to someone else or run a few
&gt;copies....I paid for it; now you can have it for free.
&gt;
&gt;                    (Recipe may be halved.):
&gt;
&gt;      2  cups butter                     4  cups flower
&gt;      2  tsp. soda                       2  cups sugar
&gt;      5  cups blended oatmeal**         24 oz. chocolate chips
&gt;      2  cups brown sugar                1  tsp. salt
&gt;      1  8 oz. Hershey Bar (grated)      4  eggs
&gt;      2  tsp. baking powder              3 cups chopped nuts (your
&gt;choice)
&gt;      2  tsp. vanilla
&gt;
&gt;        ** measure oatmeal and blend in a blender to a fine powder.
&gt;            Cream the butter and both sugars.  Add eggs and vanilla;
&gt;            mix together with flour, oatmeal, salt, baking powder, and
&gt;            soda. Add chocolate chips, Hershey Bar and nuts.  Roll into
&gt;            balls and place two inches apart on a cookie sheet.  Bake
&gt;            for 10 minutes at 375 degrees.  Makes 112 cookies.
&gt;
&gt;        Have fun!!!  This is not a joke --- this is a true story..
