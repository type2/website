Subject: painting the 61split and pop out window seals

Yesterday was the big day. I got up early and drove the van in to the state
inspectors to have them evaluate the import duty. Payed 6,500 danish
crowns, which is an approximation of the total amount. I think that works
out to about $1200USA. These people can not be rushed and will calculate
the full cost during the coming weeks.

I then drove the van up to my in laws where I stripped the vehicle of every
component I could think up in preparation for the painters. This was done
in two phases as I still had to drive the van into Sweden to the painter.
Got some odd looks at the ferry and I was sure they were going to stop me
in at the border crossing. The three inspectors gave a long look as I drove
on by.
The van looked quite the sight, no bumpers, front emblem gone with a very
dirty shadow of VW on the nose, and so on.

The paint shop was waiting with open arms. They had a bay all cleared out
for me, so I went to work removing glass lights crome and anything else I
could spot.

I've got a large box of new window seals ready to put in so new paint and
new rubber should look great.

All went well enough, thought the painter his crew and I were quite stumped
about the seal on the window of the pop outs. With brute strength we pealed
that sucker out: as it appears to be sandwiched between the two layers of
the frame. The question is: How will I ever squeeze a new seal into this
very tight grove. I must be missing something here in the process. Do I
separate the inner and outer seals from the glass and then close them onto
the inner and outer frame components? I'm stumped. Anyone been there, done
that and care to walk me through the process involved. I've checked the
shop manuals and can't see a good discription.

The painter hopes to be finished Monday, so figure that will work out to
about Wednesday in reality mode. Wish me luck.
