Hello,

I think that Bob knows that he can count on all of us.  Perhaps he was just 
trying to limit bandwidth.  He knows what help he needs and where to find 
it.  If he needs/wants general help, I'm sure that he'll ask.

Of course, I am impressed with Bob's knowledge, but perhaps even more 
impressed with the way that he communicates it.  I have been passing the 
Grendel stories along to my 14 year old son to read.  My son has this idea 
that a technical person doesn't have to be able to write well.

Thanks Bob, and thanks vanagon list.

Mike
