Gregor,
 I've been getting the parts for the rears of my '72 from JC Whipme. They have a
kit that contains all parts for both sides of the rears. Well stocked FLAPS
probably have them, too. You could also ask at a Midas shop. I don't know what
parts you need for the fronts, but you might ask your FLAPS if there are any
rebuilders in your area. They might have the parts you need. If the rods that
hold the disc pads in place are in need of replacement, I wonder what kind of
shape the rest of the calipers are in?
