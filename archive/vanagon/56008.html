&gt;Am I right that:
&gt;
&gt;  1) This configuration is common in base (non-GL) Westfalia conversions?
&gt;  2) There are two versions of non-GL campers, Wolfberg and standard, and
&gt;that the only
&gt;     difference is basically seat cover fabric and maybe some minor details?
&gt;  3) The interior of the standard non-GL camper holds up better than the
&gt;Wolfberg's?
&gt;
&gt;For what model years is the above configuration available?
&gt;
&gt;Does the name of this configuration change with the model year?
&gt;
&gt;I would appreciate clarification on these things, so that I know what models
&gt;to look for.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks.

The answer of question # 1: YES
The answer of question # 2: YES
The answer of question # 3: YES

This particular Non-GL Camper layout which I call the &quot;Westy Weekender&quot; (to
some's disdain) was offered from '84-'87. 
I know the Wolfsburg Version of this model was offered from '84-'86. (&quot;WWW&quot;)
Eric Obrien has a '87 std Non- Wolfsburg - Non-GL Westy I'm told. 

You might also want to try the '90-'91 Multivan (basically the same thing as
a &quot;Westy Weekender&quot;)
