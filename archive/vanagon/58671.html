Subject: Need advice on sanding &amp; Painting
Date: Mon, 21 Apr 1997 08:21:20 -0400

I'm about to tackle several rust spots on my ''85 Westy.  Some are pretty
deep like on the top of the plate behind the front bumper, some are surface
only.  Could someone recommend the grade &amp; type sandpaper  and method I
should
use and any other helpful hints?  Is Bondo still used for little dings or
is there something better? I understand that I should  sand, prime and
paint in one day.  I'm told that primer left un painted will still rust
underneath right away?
Some people on the list talk about sand blasting.  How involved is this? 
How much money do you have to spend to buy a small sandblaster?  Do you
have to have a compressor?  

Thanks in advance for your replies
