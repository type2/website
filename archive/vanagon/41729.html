Subject: Re: Which fluids are best?

Thank-You, John for the great and incredibly thorough information.  This is 
exactly what I needed to help me make some needed purchases this weekend.
&gt; 
&gt; Interior beverage, Coke Classic.	This is one I knew already.  There is always a supply of Coke Classic in the 
frig, and decaf Coke Classic when I have had too much of the regular stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; These are again one poor VW owning idiots opinions and are as always
&gt; worth exactly everything you paid for em.
&gt; 	For what I got, I would have paid money...Thanks
		
						Gary Norris
