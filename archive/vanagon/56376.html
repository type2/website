Subject: Re: Extra Gas?

I think it's a generally accepted practice of not keeping gasoline inside 
of a vehicle, I suppose the main risk is in case of an accident, things 
could be a lot worse if you had something so combustible inside your 
van...I've carried a gallon in a rocket box on past cross-country trips. 
On the other hand, I suppose if you're travelling somewhere so remote 
that there's no gas stations around, or not many, chances are there 
aren't many other cars around either, so there's less to worry about. 
Personally, I wouldn't do it unless absolutely necessary...

&gt; I was wondering if it is safe to carry an extra gallon of gas in a gas 
&gt; canaster inside my 1980 camper.  I'm sure some people do it.  Could you 
&gt; put the canaster in one of the cabinets?  (since my gas meter is broke, I 
&gt; have to judge the level on milage)
&gt; 
&gt; Any advice would be great.
