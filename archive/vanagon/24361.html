&gt; &gt; There's an ad in the local swap rag:
&gt; &gt; 71 VW Single Cab Pickup $585
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It caught my eye, but the wife says &quot;I don't wanna pickup; I wanna
&gt; &gt; splittie.&quot;  I'm still thinking tho.  If it's in decent shape, is this
&gt; &gt; a deal not to be passed up?  I suspect they're fairly rare, but how
&gt; &gt; much so?
&gt; 
&gt; I would buy it if it wasn't a rust bucket.  I have been looking for one 
&gt; myself.  Actually, if you grab this I will give you my '66 MicroBus for it!

I'll give you my 72 Westfalia for it!!!!  Seriously, I will!
