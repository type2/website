Subject: Thanks to all for the advice on the '87

Well I bought it.    I went down w/ a friend after work and determined that it
wasn't the trans. Could be just the linkage as I thought before, or maybe a
broken trans mount. Anyway thanks for all the responses and warnings, and Im
sure i'll have some questions in the near future as I undertake the problem. 


thanks again, 
chris
