Hi, Jon--
I was able to see the Single Cab dump truck up close and personal. The thing 
is a completely workable truck, and has some very strong hydralic 
mechanism to make it work.

However, I have no photos (Am I the only person to go to Bad Camberg 
without a camera?). Though there are LOTS of folks from NEATO who took 
videos, pics, etc. I'll announce your wish to see more in the classified 
section.

The truck narrowly missed coming to the US. It was for sale last January, 
and I tried to find someone in the US interested in it. It was used in 
Italy most of its life, and then was in Germany. There was strong 
interest from a couple people here, but because we didn't have the 
capital to just buy it and then bring it here, the Bulli-Kartei folks got 
it. It is in good hands.

A bubble-window dump went on sale at about the same time. I assume it was 
bought, too.

The trucks were very reasonably priced. . . alas. 

I'm still interested in bringing oddball commercials into the US from 
Europe, so if anyone wants to connect to the source, contact me.

&gt; Hi All,

&gt; No, this has nothing to do with Tipper Gore!
&gt; 
&gt; Upon receiving my absolutely wonderful 1996 NEATO/Bulli-Kartei/SSVC 
&gt; Bimbo-less Calendar, I've become intrigued about the 'Tipper' Single Cab 
&gt; on the front cover.  Does anyone have any decent pics or scans of these 
&gt; elusive creatures?  Until now, I've never seen any nor heard of their 
&gt; existance.  Any info is welcome!
&gt; 
&gt; The pic on the calender hides the structural features of this setup so my 
&gt; curiousity is running rampant!!  8-)
