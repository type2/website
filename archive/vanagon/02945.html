&gt; 
&gt; Your turn signal works because there is a heating element built into the
&gt; signal flasher. When the turnsignal is turned on, a connection is made to
&gt; your lights via the flasher. Inside the flasher is a heating element which
&gt; heats up a bi-metallic strip attached to a set of points. The bimetallic
&gt; strip heats up causing the points to open, which shuts off the heating element.
&gt; The bimetallic strip cools, causing the points to close and the process begins
&gt; anew.

Oh, that is most cool!  Just like blinking Christmas tree lights!  I've often
wondered why those old VWs blink so erratically...
