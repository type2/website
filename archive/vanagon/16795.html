Subject: Re: sway bar?

&gt;I was looking through some automotive catolog yesterday, and I saw a
&gt;anti-sway bar or something for old volkswagens with the swing axle rear
&gt;suspension.  Does anybody know anything about it?  Are they worth it?
&gt;(price-$60-70)  Are the swing axles that bad, especially at higher speeds? 
&gt;Oh, and I am still planning on towing that 58 double cab home, but I
&gt;thought I should probably have the bearings regreased.  Does anyone know
&gt;how much this should cost to be done?  And one final question, how much
&gt;would a new wiring harness cost?  Could I go with a used one at all? 
&gt;Thanks

Drag race that baby!

Oh, no well, I've had anti-sway bars on both the elder bus and '71 and
they're helpful but not earthshaking.  Having proper link pins, king pins,
tie-rods, bearings, drums, brakes, steering gear, shocks, tires, etc. will
be time and money better spent.

Rear bearings run in oil in the reduction gears y'know.

Wiring, eewww.  Let your fingers do the walking.

Eug,
