Subject: CIS update.

Hi Volks,
  Some of you may have noticed my plee for help with my CIS injection
problem.  Well to those who wrote me thanks for the help.
    Now, I just replaced the Pressure or warm-up regulator and my problem
is still there.  For those not informed a brief history.  I've placed a 83
GTI rabbit motor in my Vanagon last April.  I've been fairly trouble free
since then, but when it got cold it stated having random skipping problem.
I first checked all the ignition related parts, replace most IE: cap,
rotor,wires and plugs. Check distributor with a scope. Replace fuel filter.
Everything checks out ok. All this time the engine will run crappy then
suddenly it starts to run fine again. Then it crapppy again, I check all
connections, relays,and grounds. OK.  Now I check fuel delivery, pump weak
only 16oz when book says 32oz for time allowed. OK, I got it, replace fuel
pump. Problem goes away, then comes back. GRRRRR.  First time I checked
fuel pressure it was OK 68psi. After pump replacement 78psi. Sounds good to
me.  Finnaly I call a friend in the VW repair business, he says warm-up
regulator. OK, I replaced it. Problem presists.  I've had it. I'm tiered of
throwing money and time into it. I could use more help. If anyone has any
ideas no matter how insignificant, PLease,please,please write me. I'm about
to throw the motor away and get some hamsters.  I'd like to go back to the
diesel at this point. Thanks in advance.
