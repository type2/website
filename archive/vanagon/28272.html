Subject: Red Light On

&gt;I have &quot;red light on&quot; problems.  I recently replaced the
&gt;voltage regulator on the 1970 standard beetle.  It had been
&gt;clicking and the red light was coming on.  After replacing the
&gt;regulator, (although I didn't &quot;polarize&quot; the regulator) things
&gt;went well for a few hundred miles.  The red light came on
&gt;again, and stayed on, didn't change while revving, etc.  I went
&gt;through St Muir's last night, testing with the timing light, etc.
&gt;and based on the tests it appears the generator went south.  I
&gt;did the quick overhaul of the generator, which consisted of
&gt;removing the brushes in the generator, and cleaned the
&gt;commutator with the sandpaper.  Upon replacement of brushes and 
&gt;starting the car, the light was off, I figured I'd solved the 
&gt;problem. Five miles down the road, I arrived home, switched 
&gt;it off and the red light stayed on. I restarted the car, 
&gt;revved it and the light went off. Upon trying to restart it again, 
&gt;the battery slowly died.

&gt;Does the collective wisdom think that my failing to polarize
&gt;the regulator upon its replacement has/had an effect causing
&gt;this problem?  My next step is to pull the generator and have
&gt;it tested at the FLAPS, or some other expensive (re: not do it
&gt;yourself) solution....

Donald,

A voltage regulator does not require polarization.

A generator requires polarization because the initial current is produced
from the residual magnetism in the cores of the field windings.  When a
generator is overhauled it's common practice for the field windings to be
replaced.  (To remove a field winding the coil and its core are burnt by
baking them in an oven at high temperatures.  The high temperature destroys
the special varnish used to insulate the winding and bond it to the core,
allowing the copper wire to be recycled.  The high temperature also
demagnetizes the core, which is why it must be re-magnetized (or 'polarized')
upon installation.)

Unfortunately, the typical 'overhauled' VW generator available from your
FLAPS has not been completely overhauled in that the field windings have not
been replaced.  Nowadays an 'overhaul' appears to mean only that the
commutator has been turned, the mica undercut and the bearings replaced.  

The better FLAPS have provisions for checking your generator -- and the ones
they sell.  It's interesting to note that the ones they pull off the shelves
do not need 'motoring' or repolarization before testing, indicating that the
field coils were not replaced.  Raising such a point with a FLAPS clerk is an
exercise in futility; they are clerks, not electricians nor mechanics.  But
their answers are often very amusing.  

A used generator seldom requires re-polarization since some residual
magnetism will remain in the core for several years.

Are you sure you've properly diagnosed the problem?  A bad connection at some
point in your charging circuit would give the symptoms you described.  I
think it would be wise for your to obtain a copy of the Haynes repair manual
for your vehicle (their #159) and read Chapter 5 (Engine Electrical Systems),
section 10 (Charging System - Check).  The manual is well illustrated and has
none of the errors contained in St. Muir.

The method of cleaning the commutator descirbed in St. Muir is an exercise in
folly and usually does more harm than good.  The commutator may appear to be
clean but if the mica insulators are not cut back it's most likely that all
you've done is short additional windings, reducing the output of the
generator.  

While this may sound extreme, replacing your generator and regulator with an
alternator having a built-in regulator is often more cost effective than
working your way through a series of junkyard generators, or generators that
have been improperly overhauled.

The generator and alternator form a set, they wear at about the same rate.
 If one requires service or replacement it's good evidence the other does as
well.  If the generator is replaced, the regulator should be replaced at the
same time.

The brushes in an alternator give about 8x the service of brushes in a
generator and are more easily replaced.

I've a short sermon on alternators and generators in the archive maintained
by Richard Kurtz that you may find of interest.  If he has the space perhaps
he will add this note to the file.
