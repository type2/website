Subject: Cooler Now

I bled and refilled the coolant system on my '85 wasserboxer today and it 
seems to have helped, at least for the duration of the 10 mile test drive.

There is definitely a small, very small, leak in the rear heater.  Any 
suggestions?  It is not at the connections to the hoses.  I'll double 
check if it could be the valve referred to in the tech bulletin, but 
think my bus is later in the sequence and should have the newer valve.

Although I cured the heating, I obviously have not fixed why the heating 
occurs.  Hope it's just the heater leak.

It was fun doing all this in the snow (NOT), but not all that hard as I 
just ran the manure loader under the front end (with some wood for 
supports) and lifted it up almost 2 feet.

Indeed, it took several cycles of bleeding to get all the air out.
