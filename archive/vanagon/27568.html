Subject: Westfalia side hatch covers

When I bought my 84 Westfalia it had the cover plates broken off the 
hatches for the power cord and the water.  The other cover was just 
hanging with a broken spring.  Of course I went to VW to see how much 
they were and they were some crazy number like $150 each or something 
(barf.)  I decided to leave them as is.  Then I had the unfortunate 
experience of driving onto the BC Ferries with my roof vent a little 
bit up.  WHAM.  The scissors broke and a hinge broke.  The scissors were 
$92 and the hinge was $64.  Since I was fairly partial to keeping 
some of my hard earned money I located the manufacturer of the pieces 
in North Beverly Hills.  (The library can give you the number 
usually).  Anyways I ordered the scissors for ~$30, the hinge for 
$10, and the covers were between $15 and $22 depending on which one.  
The whole thing was way less expensive than one cover from VW.  
Imagine that.....
