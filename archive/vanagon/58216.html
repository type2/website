Subject: Re: pop-top seal, middle seat, 87 GL Camper

I have a collection of middle seat email from list members and other
vanagon owners.  I will send you the highlights.  I haven't found one yet
but it seems very do-able.

&gt;I'm also interested in the possibility of fitting a removable middle
&gt;seat into the vanagon.
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas welcome!
