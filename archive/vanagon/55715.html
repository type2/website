&gt;   The waterpump is right over the oil filter there, is this a sign of
failure?

&gt;  

Maybe.  There is a tell-tale hole on the water pump.  Crawl under the engine
and look at the underside of the waterpump housing just below the point where
the pulley shaft comes out of the housing.  There is a 1/8 diameter hole.
 When the waterpumps bearings are dying, this coolant will allow coolant to
comeout.  It will get increasingly worse until the pump fails completely (and
then coolant comes out of several orifaces of the pump).  Look at the hole to
see if coolant residue exists as if coolant had been dripping down the
housing from the hole.  If its there, the pump is on its way out.

Other places to look for coolant leaks are the head gaskets, coolant hoses
and overflow resvoirs.

Good Luck.
