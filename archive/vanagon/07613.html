Re: &quot;things General Motors does, blatantly, to avoid 'doing the right thing'
for their customers&quot;
I have no love for GM, the cars or the company, but I think GM is getting a
bad rap on this issue.  GM did the right thing already: sold a truck buyers
wanted at a price they wanted to pay, meeting all applicable regulations in
force.  If that's not good enough, what keeps me from suing VW because lack
of power inhibits accident avoidance?  I bought it.  If I change my mind 
about how safe it is, I'll sell it.  My problem, not the vendor's.  Flame off.
Your turn.
B.
