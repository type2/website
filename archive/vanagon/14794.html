&gt;&lt;CLIP TO SAVE PRECIOUS BANDWIDTH/Carpal Tunnel&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     I was driving my SO's BMW, and I waved at a couple of other people in
&gt;&gt; similar cars, and I either got ignored or looked at like I was Charles
&gt;&gt; Manson's Evil Separated at birth Siamese twin.  And when I waved at a guy
&gt;&gt; in a bus while driving the BMW, I got a &quot;go stick it in yer : , you yuppie
&gt;&gt; scum&quot; look.  Sheesh!  The only ones that wave consistent;y are the early
&gt;&gt; bus guys and girls.  A couple haven't, which makes me think they are up
&gt;&gt; to no good, like stealing bus parts.  Somethimes I'll geta wave from
&gt;&gt; breadloafs, and rarely from a vanagon.   NEVER, evr have I gotton a wave 
&gt;&gt; from an EV, and a see 2 or 3 a day.
&gt;......................................................................
&gt;I have noticed that when I drive the '57 Single cab that I get a little
more reaction than when I drive the Vanagon. My wife says that she gets alot
more waves and reation when she drives the '57. (Duh, wonder why?)
I have also noticed that alot of folk consider the Vanagon Campmobile only
as a road barrier. Youngish drivers seem to hate it! Now maybe if I was
driving a Beemer then I would be popular with ladies young enough to be my
daughter. My buddy has a 911, paid $1800.00 for a clutch, and $500.00 for a
tune up on another occasion. He gets plenty of looks. I give him looks like
he's nuts. Naaah, gimme my '57 and the wife. Let them drive cake!
