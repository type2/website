Subject: Austin Vee Dub bad motor

Just got a call from a friend of a friend who was passing through town on the
way to BC.  Clutch problems in a 69 bus.  It sounded like a broken clutch
cable, but when they got to my house it turned out that the cable was fine,
and the problem was deeper.   Al had five months ago had a brand new rebuildt
motor and clutch done and installed by Austin  Vee Dub, in Austin, Texas.
  Only just 2000 miles on it now.  

it has

bad clutch
blow by from the head on #1 and #2  and oil leaks from same
leaks from the oil pressure sender
looks like leaks  from the main seal
lack of power up hills
noticable endplay

the motor is still under warranty, but he had called them, and is dubious
about getting any help from that part !    

Any comments on Austin Vee Dub from listmembers in Texas?
