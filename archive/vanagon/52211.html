Wow, you did better than I did, finding someone who even HAS a crossover
pipe. I'm about to give up on it. RMMW has some parts that will fit and let
you add a muffler, but won't allow a catalytic converter to go on. Depends
on whether or not you can get away without the proper smog stuff. Also I saw
a one-piece exhaust/muffler part listed in an old JC Whitney catalog -- I'm
waiting for a new catalog to see if it's still available. Unfortunately it's
not smog-ok either. If you find a better solution, let me know! (Oh yeah,
you could have a welding shop create a crossover pipe for you somehow.) My
Haynes manual would suggest that a 2.0 litre aircooled engine, USA vehicle
except CA ... the crossover pipe ought to be interchangeable '80 -- '83.
