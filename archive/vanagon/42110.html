Subject: Austin Vee Dub bad motor #2

hi again

i pulled the motor out of Al's 69 today, after sending him to the car wash,
as those logging roads in Oregon, plus oil leaks, don't make engines fun to
work on.

the clutch problem was the throw out (throw-up) arm broken

the tailpipe wasn't on with the right clamp, and thus was loose
one of the 13mm muffler nuts was missing   (muffler had been bought new and
installed in Berkeley or somewhere near there, as the used one from Austin
Vee Dub had bad exhaust smell in the gas)
nearly all the nuts were too loose,  including muffler, engine tin, 17mms
holding the motor inetc., except the nuts holding the rocker arms on, which
were too tight.   I only checked the torque on the upper head bolts on the
1/2 side, which were loose.  this was the side with blow by.  what worries me
is the end play....  

also found tissues stuck in the fan.    bad      

more later,   clara
