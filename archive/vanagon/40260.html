&gt; avoid 

&gt; pulling it out if I can but thats where the info come in . Can anyone 
out

If the fridge operates OK in the 12V and 120V modes, your problem is 
probably with the gas burner. These typically get dirty and need to be 
cleaned.  For a quick check on burner operation, most units have a small 
flame viewer port within the box. The flame should be pure steady blue 
(yellow or flickering indicates a poor mixture or other combustion 
problem).  On my 91 Westy, servicing the unit  involves disconnecting the 
propane line and burner vent and removing the fridge mounting screws so 
the unit can be pulled out and burner assembly accessed.  I haven't done 
this myself (the first time it failed, it was under warranty), but it 
appears fairly easy to do.  Cleaning the burner assembly should be fairly 
straightforward (brushing out the soot and blowing clean), but I'd 
probably contact a parts house to be sure components are available if 
needed.  When reassembling the unit, be sure to leak check the gas line 
connections with soapy water.
