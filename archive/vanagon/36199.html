&gt;      My question: it starts well and sounds fine, 'cept there is a force of 
&gt;      air coming out of somewhere from around one of the plugs (number 2, I 
&gt;      believe).  It is not from the heater blower (which is off, and missing 
&gt;      hoses right now).  It seems to be coming from the top of the engine 
&gt;      but I can't trace it.
&gt;       
&gt;      The plug and wire lacks a seal, could it just be this?  Or might it be 
&gt;      a more significant vacuum leak somewhere, or something worse??

It's just the cooling air escaping.  Get some wires with seals and you
will be set.
