Subject: need back heatercore for 84 vanagon. help

I've been looking for a used heater core for weeks now in Seattle area with
no luck.  If anyone can find me one that won't leek. I will figure out a way
to pay for it and ship it to me.  New ones are $150 and I'm expecting to pay
$50 for a used one.
thanks
Fred
Looks like I'm fixing my Van-a-gon
