&gt; Let's assume that most of our engines have low-moderate compression (The GEX 
&gt; engine I installed had this purposely done so as to be compatible with 87 
&gt; Octane gas). This means that with FI 
&gt; there should be no knock or ping with low grade (read 87 Octane) gas. I 
&gt; have heard it said by some manufacturers ie SAAB that with their engines 
&gt; and electronic ignition advance systems, 87 Octane will provide the same 
&gt; performance as 92. Is this also true for Vanagons (and all other 
&gt; systems with FI)? In other words, if an engine doesn't knock or ping with 
&gt; 87 Octane, then why go to a higher grade?

If an engine doesn't ping on 87, there is no reason to go to a higher grade.
Unless...

&gt; Wouldn't the answer be that the higher grade provides more power but only   
&gt; if in the event we 
&gt; wanted to advance the ignition past the point of normal ie 6 degrees atdc?

I don't know if this applies to the VW motors (I suspect it does) but in the
5 liter Mustang world, of which I am also a part, this is a proven fact.
Several extra horses can be gained by using the highest available octane
gasoline (usually 92 or 93) and advancing the timing to the point of
impending detonation.  For the Mustang this is an extra 3-5 degrees of
advance.  

*soapbox on*

	I wouldn't try this on an engine with aluminum cylinder heads,
though, because detonation will destroy them in short order.  I used dished
(low compression) pistons for my VW's motor, and made sure my heads were NOT
milled.  This together with the fact that I don't advance my timing very
much (on the VW) makes me feel safe from detonation even with the cheapest
crap *85* octane gas that you can find at some hole-in-the-wall stations
in the Southwest.  With the VW, I don't think it's worth taking a chance on
destroying your engine just to get a couple of &quot;free&quot; horsepower.

I have resigned myself to the fact that my bus will never be a speed demon,
and I am okay with it now...  I am much more interested in keeping the
thing alive.
