Subject: Whoa!  I'm back!

Howdy,

My ISDN line (and my link with the world) went down two days ago, and I've
been cut off until now, when I went out and bought a modem.  (They're
working on the ISDN line, but they muttered something about the trunk, and
'It oughta never worked!'.)

After a painful 250+ letter download, I wanted to let y'all know that the
donations have began arriving.  In order to keep everything on the
up-and-up, I'll be posting the initials and amounts for all donors at
     http://www.vanagon_dot_com/links/list_donations.html

Please wait an appropriate amount of time, and then look for your initials
(and city/town) on this list.  Note that I'm not doing this to pressure
folks to donate... I'm doing this to let folks know that I'm not going to
Tierra del Fuego with your donations :-).

Ron
