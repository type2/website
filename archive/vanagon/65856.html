&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I've been viewing the list now for several months and really enjoy all of
&gt; the ideas that are exchanged. Thanks! This is my first attempt at asking a
&gt; question so please correct me if I break an unsaid protocols. ;)
&gt;
&gt; I have an 84 Westy and live in Jacksonville, Florida. I'm going to be
&gt; installing an auxillary battery but I am underwhelmed by the amount of
&gt; space under the driver's seat for such an installation.  The small space
&gt; seems to demand the more expensive gel cell batteries that can be tipped on
&gt; their side so the terminal posts are out of the way.  Yesterday while I was
&gt; replacing the voltage regulator I noticed quite a bit of empty space in the
&gt; engine compartment (extreme back right corner) that seems big enough to
&gt; hold a LARGE (1000 Amp Hours, $59.00 autoZone) deep cycle battery.  Has
&gt; anyone tried this?  Good idea or just brain flatulence?
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
