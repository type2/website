&quot;Manifold Destiny&quot;, hmmmm....


Now there's a novel idea:  Meals (made) On Wheels... (MmOW for short).
 we could list delicacies such as:

 10W30Burger (served with a oil filter-full of Flat Pancake Ale on the side)

 Belt Shreddings with FeO2 seasoning 

 Vacuum-hose pastry

any more ideas?????
