Subject: need to &quot;See the light&quot;

Stupid Sunday question. My '85 Westy has a knob to the left of the 
sliding heater/vent controls for the rear seat fan unit-it is lit up when 
the dash lights are on.  To the right of the sliding controls there is 
also a fan knob for the front seat area which is not lit up.  Also, there 
is no light on the gear shift position (automatic).  Is there supposed to 
be sights here? if so, how do I get to each of them to replace bulbs or 
whatever?  I can't find any reference to them in owners manual so I 
figured maybe they don't exist???
