Subject: diesel cooling woes revisited

My diesel had cooling problems this past summer, but after bleeding, 
replacing the thermostat, and flushing, everything was A-OK.  Today in 
the frigid weAther (10-20 f) New problems arose.  I first noticed a 
problem when The heat whhich normally is excellent, was non-existent even 
with the temp gauge at the normal 1/3 mark.  I sensed problems, but not 
until the temp gauge rose and light flashed did I realize the extent.  I 
pulled over, released the pressure cap and added straight antifreeze.  I 
drove another 2-3 miles before the problem  resurfaced. I left her there 
and returned tonight. I limped home and sheltered her in the garage, 
whwere she now sits.
Im afraid the problem lies on my shoulders as all through the original 
problems, I always replaced lost coolant with H2O, diluting it.  I 
thought to add some staright anti-freeze last week, but checked it and  
it seemed alreight (ie it was still nice and green!).  But with todays 
harsh temps, Im afarid I has some freezing and perhAps blockage in the 
pipes to the radiator. Does this seem logical?  I thought thaT if this 
was the case, it would mely from the heat of the coolant in the engine, 
but maybe not?  I looked and did not notice any split hoses or burst 
pipes, but it was dark and I didn't check it very thoroughly, which I 
will do tomorrow.  I think the fact that I had no heat implies that there 
was some blockage.
Now did I do terrible damage to my van? Is it possible the warm temps in 
the garage will help melt the ice and solve all of my problems?
any advice greatly appreciated
