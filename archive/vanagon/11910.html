Subject:       Re: Torque Wrench Opinions

opinion asked of what torque wrench used:

I use 2 Snap-On models.  One is the click-type in 1/2&quot; drive.  Very 
nice, beautiful finish that is easy to keep clean, complete feel of 
quality.  It was a birthday gift from my father and is one of those 
gifts very dear to me (the guy gets sentimental over a tool? -- darn 
right!).  If you get the click type, always store it with the torque 
cranked down to the lowest setting to maintain accuracy.

The second on is a cool little in 3/8&quot; drive that measures in 
inch-pounds on a dial.  Surprisingly, I use this one quite a bit and 
is great for evenly torqueing small, machined covers etc.  This one 
is on &quot;loan&quot; from aforementioned Dad... wonder if he remembers I have 
it...
