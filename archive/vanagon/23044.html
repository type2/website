&gt; &gt; no, but hanging a bunch of metal pipes outside and letting the wind bang
&gt; &gt; them into each other is.   ???  :)

&gt;  As I see it, Cage's 4'33&quot; is a piece that asks you to stop for a few 
&gt;minutes, think about what music *is* and listen to the music of the *world*.

Actually, we were just talking about Cage the other day.  I think that his
infamous 4'33&quot; is about letting the audience be the music.  Listening to the
piece, you would definitely get a 'musical' feel:

     The piece opens quietly, expectantly.

     As the piece progresses, there is rustling heard.  This increases in tempo
     and volume as the audience begin to unwillingly become instruments of the
     piece.

     There is an occasional staccato burst of outrage or giggling.

     About 2/3 of the way through the piece, as understanding dawns, the
audience
     begins to quiet again, as members become more 'audience' than
'instruments'.

P.S.   4'33&quot; is the only piece I can play on the piano :-).
