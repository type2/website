&gt; Yikes! On our way back through Buffalo I picked up a couple of Loctite
&gt; &quot;Bullseye&quot; windshield repair kits. 

And you discovered that they're CRRRRAP!

The things that windshield shops use to accomplish the same ends
are much more complex and use much higher pressures and stronger 
vacuums and actually do work, but the hand held syringe ones suck.

&gt; I tried them out on a couple of
&gt; &quot;halfmoon&quot; looking cracks in the windshield. The syringe-looking device
&gt; affixes to
&gt; the windshield and fluid is injected into the cracks. Applying pressure
&gt; created more cracks and they now appear to be lengthening over time. One
&gt; is &quot;star-like&quot; while the other is a straight line. What can I do short of
&gt; replacing the windshield?

You can make bets on which crack will reach the rubber first.  Winner
gets Fifty bucks but has to pay the deductable for the windshield replace.

&gt; 
&gt; I have heard the following and seek advice on this strategy: drill two
&gt; small holes at each end of the cracks and inject with crazy glue. Has
&gt; anyone tried this? Are there alternatives that work?

I have heard of it, but not tried it...
I beleive (but am not neccessarily correct) that attempting to drill
through your windshield would be just enough stress to allow those
cracks to finish the race in a matter of seconds.

&gt; 
&gt; I am less concerned about the view out the windshield (because they are
&gt; not line of sight) and more concerned about the windshield cracking under
&gt; pressure while driving. Its an 82 Westfalia and the cracks were there when I
&gt; bought the van. It passed the MOT roadworthiness test because 
&gt; line of sight was not an issue.

The cracks will slowly spread, but the glass is very unlikely to just
&quot;shatter&quot; from the pressure of driving.
You may just want to live with it untill it gets truely irritating.

&gt; 
&gt; PS Our insurance policy will cover the cost of replacement save 50
&gt; deductible. I would rather not have this done because of the way the
&gt; windshield is affixed to the frame. A less than competent job could result
&gt; in leaks.

I have had the vanagoon's windshield replaced, and am very happy with
the job that was done. ( though I didn't have the choice of leaving it,
it caught a chunk of ice about a cubic foot size which had poor timing
falling off of an overpass)
I don't think that you will end up with leaks if you take it to a reputable
or Big name place like Apple Autoglass or such.  If it does leak, make 
em fix it.

&gt; Thanks in advance - David C.

You're welcome...

Come on the Turkey Point Camp Out.
