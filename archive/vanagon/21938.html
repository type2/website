Martha,

Christa and I camped in the Mojave Desert about 20 miles south of the 
Wiley's Well exit on I-10(which is about 20 miles W of Blythe), and yep, 
sure was quiet!  We didn't venture too far off the dirt road we were 
driving on 'cause we didn't want to damage the desert floor, but not a 
single vehicle passed by on the dirt road in the 10+ hours we slept and 
lazed there.  Not a single amenity provided by the BLM, of course, but 
this _is_ the point of the whole exercise, after all.  Just lots of 
desert, lots of sand.  You'd have to get creative finding things to do 
for entertainment.  We managed to find something to do.....  :)  :)
