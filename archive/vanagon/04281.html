&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know if there is a concave (magnifying) mirror replacement for
&gt; the right side mirror on '80 Vanagons?  I'm getting really tired of looking
&gt; into that mirror and seeing only the hood ornament of the vehicle in the
&gt; other lane.  At night or in rainy weather, the mirror is nearly useless for
&gt; lane changes, and there's a humoungous blind spot.  I've tried a small
&gt; circular mirror glued onto the existing mirror, but it's too small to see
&gt; anything at a glance.
&gt; 

	I can't drive with a rear-view due to an ugly rear-ender years ago
	so I'm thouroughly dependent on my side-views. 

	On both cars, I have ~3&quot; circular convex mirrors mounted on the lower
	outside corners of all side-views. I find these to be great; so
	good that I'm comfortable cruising with Vuarnets that have side shields.

	The only time I use the rear window, is in tight space (parking).

	I also (as a cyclist) feel more comfortable as I'm able to see cyclists
	next to my cars.

	scr
