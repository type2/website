I guess not.  At least with Bus Boys Safaris you can close them at least 10
times before you break the latches. (only kidding :) ) and at least the color
is the correct white the factory used.  O well, what do you expect with hand
welded latch tabs instead of die spot welded tabs.  All kidding aside, Steve
and Joe try to do a flattering imitation of our Safaris.  I guess next time
spend a little extra and get 'em right.
