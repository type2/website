Subject: WESTY FABRIC

SORRY, SORRY, SORRY.

That said I've been really busy with work, like travelling 3 days a week
for the last 3 weeks.  This combined with breaking the cardinal rule of 
VW Bus buying (bought a non running '81 Westy over 5.5 hours from me) 
has really eaten my time.  I have fabric in hand, it is very nice, '76 
production FWIW, a very a good year in tacky Westy interior colors.
But in order to stop jerking everbody around I promise that when I
get back from a business trip to Yuma AZ, this Thursday I shall
go straight to the UPS place and get costs for everyone, then get this
stuff out promptly.  I hate to do this again but just so I'm sure I got
all info correct, please email me with address and yardage once more,
as well as any special instructions.  I will be suspending my list mail
so I can be sure not to lose anyone.  In fact please also CC my work 
address where I will be sure not to lose it.

I also post this to both lists in case I don't reach somebody,
also there might be a couple extra yards left in the end if someone
is interested by people already buying get first dibs.
