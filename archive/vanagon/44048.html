Subject: Vanagon Tires

Hi,
Not too long ago someone wrote of their experience with Bridgestone Duelers.
I've lost the message.  But tires are past due (hence the 15&quot; wheel post
again).  Does anyone know about Bridegestone Dueler A/T's - 27x8.5x14?

Sorry to dredge up the tire issue again, but I really need to buy tires.  My
185SR14 passenger car tires (done by PO) have finally given up the ghost.

Thanks,
Bo Kersey
