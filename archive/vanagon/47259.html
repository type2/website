Subject: Bubble in cooling system? '87 Vanagon

Well this stuff only happens to me!!

I was driving my newly purchased '87 Westy sycro home today, and the small
coupling hose (from coling system to block) blew. Now I won't bore you with
the details of how I fixed this with vitually no tools, but I was able to
properly replace the hose and clamp evrything up.

I added some water to the cooling tank, but there was no circulation. Broke
out the manual, and it said to open up a bleed nut on the radiator (which I
did), and one in the engine compartment (which I alson did). I followed the
instructions but still no circulation. 

Did a vapor lock/ bubble get intoduced into the system when the hose broke
and was replaced? I'd run the engine longer to see if it travels, but the
temp shots up iin no time. Do I have to drain the whole system? Is it
something more serious?

Thanks for any and all help!!

Still looking for recomendations for VW mechaniocs in Northern &amp; central New
Jersey!

Bill
