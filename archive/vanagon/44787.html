Subject: RE:  Transmission Popping out of 1st

Popping out of gear is usually a sign of a dying trans.  Worn out gears is
the problem.  Time for a rebuild or a new tranny.

&gt;I have an 84 Vanagon who's transmission just started popping out
&gt;of 1st gear during hard deceleration.  Has anyone every run into
&gt;this problem before?  If so, what was the solution.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance.
