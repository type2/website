Hey all,

Does anyone know where to get those Farfenugan &lt;sp&gt; stickers from?  I saw a
sticker that said 'Barelygruven'.  I've got to get this for my Vanagon.  Its
got no power compared to most other cars on the road.

Seperate subject.  The drivers door lock (85 Vanagon) can only be locked from
the outside with the key.  Is there a way to disable this 'anti-lock-out'
feature?  It sure is annoying.

-Gregg
