I will try to answer your questions below each one.

 My questions are:
 
 a) given that, next to the ECU, the airflow meter is the most costly
 electronic  item to replace in the engine compartment doesn't it make sense
 to develop some kind of air flow faq or &quot;how to&quot;  info package on the air
 flow meter?  For example, can anyone explain how they work; how they can be
 adjusted; if they should be adjusted and what the consequences are?  My
 airflow meter has some 170,000 miles on it so it would come as no big
 surprise that the spring would need tightening. Is there any down side to
 this? I have used a simple way of checking: tighten the dial and then check
 the color of the plugs plus listen to the idle.
 
The airflow meter gives the ECU a signal that is proportional to the volume
of air going through it.  There is also a temparature sensor that is used to
give the ECU a means to compensate for air density.  Other cars use a &quot;Mass
Airflow Meter&quot; to do this as it is more accurate and performs both functions
with no moving parts.

 b) how does an airflow meter work in conjunction with the injectors and O2
 sensor? Is fuel constant with the  air flow being varied? Why does the idle
 mixture  screw have a  minimal impact - does it work at idle only?

The injectors actually fire once each engine revolution.  The combination of
inputs from all the sensors including the air flow meter determine the lenght
of time the injectors are open each time they open. The O2 sensor fine tunes
the works so that the mixture is as claose to perfect as possible.  If any
sensor fails, the ECU goes into a limp mode that is designed to get you off
the highway.  According to EPA rules, an emmisions system failure should
either turn on a warning light(American service engine soon) or make the
engine run in a way you know something is wrong.  I suspect that your rich
condition is really caused by a bad temp sensor or connection, or a weak O2
sensor.  Bad grounds in the system will also make the van run rich.  
 
 c) Is there  a way of testing meter effectiveness? In other words are all of
 them adjusted to certain factory specs and then installed and if so what
 arethos specs? ie certain output at certain loads.
 
If the O2 sensor is working properly, it will overide and readjust the air
flow meter.  The meters calaibration is only important during warm-up,(open
loop operation).  After that, it is used mostly for sudden changes in airflow
such as moving the accelerator.  Also check the fuel presure regulator to
make sure it is adjusting the pressure with manifold vaccuum.  See the
Bentley book.      
 
If you want, I can send you some articles I,ve wriiten on emission controls.
 Maybe they be of some help to you .  Let me know.
