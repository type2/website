&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;In Texas, it's called Texas Citizen Action, based in Austin and Ft. Worth.
&gt;&gt;They made a huge difference in the favor of consumers when Gov. Ann 
&gt;Richards
&gt;&gt;appointed the head of Texas Citizen Action to head the Texas Board of
&gt;&gt;Insurance.  Since newly-elected Gov. Shrub Bush has been in office, he's
&gt;&gt;appointed white males from the insurance industry to the Texas Board of
&gt;&gt;Insurance and fired the consumer advocate, resulting in much higher rates
&gt;&gt;for the general public.

&gt;Is this the first proven connection between genitalia, skin color, and
&gt;economics?
&gt;So the racists were right after all!   ;)

No, just same as it ever was: the Good Ol' Boy system at work in Texas
government.  Really doesn't have that much to do with race or gender (It's
not the color of your skin; it's the color of your money).  I'm sure the
current Gov.'s Office could've dug up some Aunt Thomasina  black females,
token Hispanics or even hermaphrodite Eskimos to represent the insurance
industry's interests on the State Board of Insurance.

BTW, Candidate Bush received millions in campaign funds from insurance
industry lobbyists and PACs.

Costs me about 25% more per year SO FAR, and we're only into his first year
of office.
