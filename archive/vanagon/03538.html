Subject: Fahrvergnugen Groovin'

Being a 'newbie and all, I'm hesitant to overstep the bounds of propriety 
and offend anyone, but having found this wonderful forum, I just can't 
suppress my curiousity any longer.  So here goes (and I really don't 
think it's all that bad):  About a year ago I spotted a recent model 
Westphalia, parked in a rather large (and, incidentally, definitely 
upscale) local restaurant parking lot, sporting a rear window decal, that 
looked exactly like the standard VW Fahvergnugen sticker, complete with 
recumbent stickman figure, that read &quot;Fukengruven&quot; even including umlauts
over the &quot;u&quot;'s.  I'm sorry, flame me, call me tasteless, heck, kick me 
outa here (no, not that please - I'll behave from now on), but I WANT 
ONE!  My wife, a staid, reticent woman of pure Norwegian descent, will 
even let me mount the d*mn thing!  As anyone else seen these?  Where can 
I get one (preferably by special courier, or maybe I could settle for FedEx)?
