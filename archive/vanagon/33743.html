I was originally attracted to the bus after realizing that a beetle would
be impractical when I grew my family a year or so ago. Checked into the
internet, to see what resources were available, and was amazed at what I
found.

I had thought that a bus purchase would be fairly inexpensive (compared to
new vehicle prices!) and that it would take a steady flow of cash to
maintain -- but it was do-able. Now, I'm not so sure...

4WD would be great, I thought, so why not a Syncro? Not so cheap, those.

Camping's fun too! -- also a premium.

The fun that can be had is still beckoning to me, but economic reality is
trying to put me in a headlock. I'd really appreciate it if someone could
post what it costs them to own a wasserboxer. Insurance costs, oil/gas,
parts/maintenance, etc. I realize there is probably a premium involved
here, since the *bus* is the thing, not necessarily the economy of it, but
I'd still like to know...
=================================
I am replying to the group at large so that if any of them have differing
views on what I am telling you, they can balance what I am telling you.

I have an unusually large family 9currently wife + 5 kids still  at home), and
do a fair amount of &quot;home improvement/maintenance&quot;.  I have owned both a '73
bus and,  currently,  an '82 diesel Vanagon that I purchased new.  As a
general statement, I will say that the VW bus/Vanagon has been the most
versitile vehicle I have found. - for hauling family, home
improvement/maintenance stuff and just general &quot;stuff&quot;.  The down side is that
these vehicles are generally not considered flashy, sexy, sports cars or hot
rods, but as a general all around mode of transport, they are very hard to
beat.  4' x 8' panels, 12-14' boards/beams rolls of carpet, piles of newspaper
for scout recycling fund raises, dishwashers, washers, dryers, lots of family
- - are all easily accomodated often simultaneously.

Insurance costs are not that bad in my experience, and purchase cost - well,
the average price of a new car now is running around $22K !  Fuel economy in
the '73 was around 17-18 mpg (carborated) and the diesel , although admittedly
slow, gets a steady 30+ mpg in town or on the road. 

 My other two cars are a '68 Pontiac Lemans, and a '86 BMW 528e.  For repairs
on any of the three vehicles that I find I choose to have done, I find that
labor rates are about the same no matter which vehicle, and parts for imported
vehicles are pretty consistent regardless of which (except occasionally for
special items that are &quot;bell and whistle dealer only&quot;)  

A great thing regarding VW Vans and this group is the depth and sharing of
knowledge that is combined with the willingness of the folk on the group to
help oneanother solve or deter various automotive problems.  We have some folk
here with amazing depth of experience and knowledge  relating to VWs.
