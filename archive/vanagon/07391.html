Subject: Our house karma, and Volkswagens

I live in a group house with five other people, three of who also own
Volkswagens.   There's my 70  bus, Pete's 70 bus, Ethan's 80 bus, and
Jen's 84 Jetta (well what can you do, she had bought a  water cooled
car before I met her.  I tried to get her to sell it and buy a  bug
or bus, but no dice).  Also, my friend Ralph occasionally brought his
72 Bug over.   We've lived there for a year and a half and this odd
notion just came over me recently.  My bus has bee nin and out of
commission for the past 1.5 years (more out than in unfortunately).
Jen's car died soon after she moved in.  Pete has never gotten his
bus running.  And Ethan's has just died.

However, in looking at the cycle of when they died, Pete's arrived
there and has always been there dead.  He put a newly rebuilt engine
in it soon after we moved in and actually got it started.   Then, I
bought my bus.  His engine started making clanky noises, sounded like
a thrown rod.  Then, my bus oil cooler seals blew in the middle of
freezing winter, snow on the ground, no way to work on it.  This
happened right around the time that Jen moved in with her working
Jetta.  We finally got around to fixing my bus during some clear
ground time, and soon after it was running, Jen's car died.  My car
died over the summer and we were running Volkswagenless.   Pete got a
new engine to try and put it in, it sounded fine, etc.  Then Ethan
moved in with his  Vanagon and Pete's engine started blowing oil from
somewhere! Keeps blowing oil tower seals from a clog somewhere!
Well, I went out and spent about $800 on a new engine and extra stuff
for it and just got mine started last night.  Ethan's died Sunday!

Coincidence or spooky Volkswagen karma!!!   Regardless of what it is,
I am taking  a sledgehammer to the other three tonight to make sure
mine stays running!!!!!
