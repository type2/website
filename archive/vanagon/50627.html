&gt;gonna tell him? :-)

While most authorities place the anonymous authorship of Beowolf's epic poem
in northern England in the fifth century, it quickly spread, appearing -- in
a variety of forms -- throughout northern Europe, Scandanavia and even
Iceland by the middle of the sixth century.  

Most of us are aware of the English version.  Finland has its own unique tale
of Beowolf while Iceland has at least five Beowolf sagas to choose from.

The version I found most appealing and most in tune with my acquisition of a
sadly abused 1967 Microbus from the Pacific Northwest, is one of the
Icelandic versions of the tale in which Beowolf becomes enchanted by Grendel
after struggling with her for so long, eventually falling under a spell in
which he sees the hag as a beautiful woman -- and does the usual thing.
 Bewitched by the hag, Beowolf carries her from the dank swamps of the north
to his hilltop village in the sunny south and there they live together, much
to the dismay of Beowolf's neighbors.  But the longer they are together a
curious change takes place.  Grendel becomes younger and more beautiful while
Beowolf becomes old, infirm and feeble-minded.  In the end, the people stone
them to death.

The instant I saw the name 'Grendel,' proposed by a member of this list, I
recalled the Icelandic version of the saga and realized there could be no
name more apt for the old bus.  And yes, I am growing old and feeble-minded
even as she is becoming young and beautiful :-)
