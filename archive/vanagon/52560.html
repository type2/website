Subject: An Ad I spotted

I saw this ad in an older copy of the Dallas Morning News.  Perhaps 
it can be of use.

&quot; 2 1959 single cab p/u, both compl, 1 no eng, no titles, $1000/pair  
817-484-5526&quot;

I have some idea of what it takes to get a title in the state of 
Texas.  It can be done with some ease.  You still have to go through 
some bureacracy.
