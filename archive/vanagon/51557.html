Subject: 83.5 push rod tubes

Hey Listees

While putting my exhaust mannifolds back on my 83 waterboxer and general
cleaning, poking around I noticed my push rod tubes are not all the same: two
on the left and one an the right are made out of a thinner looking metal and
are jointed in the middle ( as opposed to the solid tubes with the
coil/spings at the ends).  I am hoping this means that someone has put new
ones in.  If this is true, did they have to take the heads off?  (meaning
that the head gasket has been replaced somewhere in the 107,000 miles  my
van's got?)

I am most curious, mostly thinking (HOPING) that the heads are not somthing I
am going to have to tackle any time soon, although there is a very slow leak
from the right head gasket.

Thanks in advance, mike
