&lt;&lt; I've been looking for a late model vanagon westy and some adds use the
 term  &quot;Wolfsburg&quot;. What does this mean? &gt;&gt;

Wolfsburg Limited Edition (aka Wolfsburg, aka WLE) is a name that VW applies
to selected models each spring to help bolster sales in the middle of the
model year.  Along with the name comes some features that are different from
the &quot;regular&quot; models.  Features might include alloy wheels, leather seating,
stereo, ad a &quot;special&quot; paint color.  From year to year the WLE models are not
necessarily the same.  They've been doing this since about 82 or 83.  I
believe the first Vanagon WLE was a 1984 model and not all Vanagon WLEs are
the same.  In 1986 the Vanagon WLE had a pop-top roof by Westfalia, a
12VDC/120VAC (not propane) refrigerator, a fold up table and seating for 6.
 In later years (1987-1990) the Vanagon WLE model had a fixed roof, two
removeable rear-facing seats behind the front seats, rear seat that folds
into a bed, and a fold up table.
