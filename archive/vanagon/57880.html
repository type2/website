Subject: Re: Short Wave Radio


I have shortwave radios both in my '56 beetle and my '93 Eurovan. The '56 
has the old Blaupunkt AM/FM/LW/SW tube-type radios with the large power 
converters.

The EV has a Becker Mexico AM/FM/SW/LW cassette unit which I bought this 
past December from RJS Direct (email RDSDRCT_at_aol_dot_com) 800-757-3728. It cost 
abut $550. According to the 1997 Passport to World Band Radio, its the only 
SW auto radio thats sold in the US.

It has 10 pre sets for SW stations, 10 for AM, 10 for LW and 30 for FM, it 
can scan or be tuned, its coded and has a removable face plate, etc. It 
fits in the DIN radio hole....and is a much better radio (AM/FM/cassette 
part) than the original factory radio that came with the EV.

The owner of RJS owns a 95 EV camper so installation help was available. 
Both he and I use the stock antenna and the reception is great. 

Hope this helps.


Ric
