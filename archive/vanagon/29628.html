My apologies to the net for using this venue - I tried a direct reply to Brian
and it bounced.

To Brian.Harrison:
Brian - thanks for the reply.

A digital mis-hap.  I have an '82 diesel vanagon.  What I didn't recognize was
your use of &quot;transporter&quot; as in what is sold in the US as a Eurovan.  I know
that Vanagons were discontinued sometime in the 92-3 period, but didn't
recognize from your description that you had the new vehicle.

  &quot;AARRRGGHHHH!&quot;
