&gt; &gt;camping BTW, dark tint the windows,  use dark solid color curtains and park
&gt; &gt;in front of the Ritz, they have the nicest bathrooms.
&gt; 
&gt; I have not seen the street camping topic discussed on the list.
&gt; 
&gt; Our first time street camping was in the Los Angeles area. We were at the
&gt; DisneyLand and when we came out it was around midnight. Instead of checking
&gt; into a hotel we found a safe neighborhood and slept in our 85 Westy on the
&gt; street. On that same trip out west we did this several times and did not
&gt; get into any trouble.
&gt; 
&gt; With three kids now I don't think we can do it anymore but I am curious to
&gt; hear what are others experience in this regard. Is it illegal to sleep in
&gt; your car on a public street?
Although it probably is illegal, I have done it many times, in a rather
conspicuous rainbow split-window. Most recently, this summer, while
following a certain stigmatized rock band, I slept at a couple rest
areas, (ok, but often hasseled by cops), hotel parking lots, (ok, but
you have to leave early), and the best, truck stops. My hearty
recommendation for anyone wishing to sleep for free, in a realtively
hassle-free environment is to stay at a truck stop. Most even have
separate areas for cars, and you have access to restrooms with showers,
as well as gas, and often a cafeteria-style eatery. A big thumbs up to
Citgo, and BPtruck plazas.
