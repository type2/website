If it is a tube and fin element, it is garbage.  If it is a flat plate design, 
it will not need a fan if placed in a good source of air flow.  The cooler is 
really needed at high rpm.  No air flow at idle is not a problem.  You must 
first determine the need and the cause of the oil getting too hot.  Cooler oil 
does very little to cool the heads.  The heads are where most heat related 
failures occur.

Here's another question for all you guys.

Has anyone used one of the electric fan
type oil coolers?  How good are they?
I'm especially interested in BUS owners.

Thanks for your imput.
Martin
