Subject: Re: CD Changer


Where to run the cable? I don't like to have them under the
carpet, put it under the van. But this is a lot of work, I did
it for the antenna wires.

What's about to put the changer behind the glove box? Sorry,
I do not have this box, but there should be plenty of room
to mount the small changer in there.
