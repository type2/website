&gt; If you do decide to take it out, let me know how hard it was. I'd like to
&gt; see where the condensate on mine is coming from and from looking
&gt; under/behind it I can tell it needs a good cleaning!

It is easy to take it out.  It is only a bit harder to put it back. It takes
a bit of shoving.
