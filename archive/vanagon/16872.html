&gt; Thanks to all who responded. Yeah, in retrospect the heat exchange area is
&gt; woefully inadequate. I like the Saab solution that fits onto the cooolant
&gt; return line and can dump &quot;excess&quot; heat into the resevoir. I think that
&gt; some sort of insulation around the resevoir is needed in the vanagon to
&gt; keep any heat in (look at where it is located!). 
&gt; Another problem with my set-up is that the fluid drains back down the
&gt; line. Some sort of check valve is needed.

I would vote against a check valve on the basis that the fluid standing 
in the line would freeze during the Winter since it's not in the reservoir.  
You'd then have to wait for the heat from the engine to thaw the line 
before any fluid would come forth.  The expanding water/antifreeze could 
conceivably cause the line to burst as well, since the high(er) fluid 
temp would cause the line to become brittle faster than without the fluid 
heater.

&gt; While I'm at it, wouldn't it be lovely to have the European Vanagon option
&gt; of headlight washers? The resevoir tank has two pumps, one for the
&gt; windshield and one for the lights.
