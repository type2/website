Subject: ANYBODY IN D.C./ MD???

Howdy all. As a zealous member of the Air Cooled Search and Rescue Team, I'm in
hot pursuit of a new VW, but I need some help this time. I'm in NC, and the
vehicle is in Bowie, Maryland, which is right outside Washington DC. I spoke
with the owner last night, and it sounds good, but I'd really like it if one of
you kind volks in the area might be able to stop by today sometime and check it
out for me. Time is important, as I don't want this one to slip away if it's
all it's supposed to be.
Anyway, if anyone is in the area and can help me out, please e-mail me, and
I'll give directions and all that.
Many thanks
