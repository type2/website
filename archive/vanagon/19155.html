Subject: Another neat VANAGON/EUROVAN toy


As you know I tend to drive my EuroVan in a spirited manner (put
the ABS to use by late braking for exit ramps...etc)...unfortunately
when the rear compartment is filled with grocery bags I get nasty
surprises when I pop the rear hatch...namely 1/3 of the groceries
tumble out.

Rather than tone-down my driving style I bought a new toy for the
EV (which can be used in the less-able-to-be-spirited-driven-Vanagons)..
a Cargo Net from Griot's Garage (800-345-5789) For $17.95 they will
sell you a net that is approx 18&quot; tall by 50-60&quot; long which attaches
by self-adheisive or screw on hooks to the trunk....or in this case
the opening of the rear hatch..

Now when I go wizzing around corners (as opposed to urinating into
concomming traffic (see last week's discussion)) the groceries 
stay in place.
