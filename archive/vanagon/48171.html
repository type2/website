if your ground cable is warm, it is due to a poor ground connection 
and not due to a 'short'.  this same poor ground will raise havoc 
with the alternator and charge indicator light.

nope.  1/2 hour of intimate contact with your ground strap.  get it 
clean, the battery post clean, the body where it attaches clean.  and 
clean the one that goes between the body and the tranny while you're 
dirty.
