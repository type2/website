To All:

Holding chamber volume to .1cc is like running a four minute mile -- not
everyone can do it and even those who can often chose to take the bus.

Unless you're going for the gold, the added time and expense of nailing down
the chamber volume to a perfect, repeatable figure within .1cc across all
four jugs is really gilding the lilly.  It has taken me as long as a week to
match a set of heads to .1cc, whereas getting them within 1.0cc ( plus or
minus 0.5cc) is pretty easy.  

Normally, you adjust chamber volume by sinking one of the valves.  If you've
got a lot of volume to make up, you sink the intake, but never very much. You
want the intake valve to keep its head up.  On the other hand, the exhaust
valve can be down in a well and still work, thanks to the pressure during the
exhaust cycle.  But adjusting valve depth is a trivial task.  You need a set
of stones and the tools and the skills.  And you must be accustomed to
working to very close tolerances.  Go a bit too far and you'll end up having
to do the other three over to match your mistake.

You'll encounter the same difficulties when you try to keep your deck height
to some small value.  Deck height determination really starts before the
engine is assembled.  You need to determine the precise center-to-center
length of each rod -- they vary according to how the big end is honed -- and
on each piston, the distance between the wrist-pin bore and the head of the
piston.  You also must measure each of your cylinders using a surface plate
and surface gauge.  You do your first pre-assembly by matching 'short' rods
to 'long' pistons in an effort to make all of equal length but you don't
really know anything until the crankcase is torqued and the cylinders seated
with a dummy head, a plate with spacers that allows you to torque the
cylinder studs to spec.  Deck height is measured through a hole in the plate.

The trick here is to arrive at a consistant height for all of the cylinders
while you maintain the same deck height.  It is virtually impossible to do
this without having a lathe, since the final dimension is usually achieved by
shaving a few thou off the heads of the 'fat' pistons,  but you can shuffle
components to arrive at the best average.

Deck height is the most critical of your volumetric-balance dimensions
because a small dimensional change results in a large change in volume.

If you're building a plain vanilla engine, measure everything but do not
attempt to balance chamber volume until you've done at least the first
pre-assembly to determine deck-height.  Often times you'll be able to balance
a big chamber with a small deck-height and arrive at a good average volume
across all four jugs.

A key point to keep in mind is that your engine will run with some amazing
imbalances in both mass and volume, but it does so at an equally amazing
cost.  An out of balance engine is destined to live a short, expensive life
whereas one that is balanced with respect to both mass and volume uses less
fuel to produce the same power and has a useful life considerably longer than
it's mass-produced cousins.  And these are improvements that are built-in for
the life of the engine, repaying their cost many times over.
