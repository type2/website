Subject:      composite answer...

To answer a helpful prod, I won't be doing any of this stuff myself because
I'm going to Westphalia Wanderers meeting in WV next week and I've only taken
a couple of vacation days and crammed the rest of my work week into the
remainder (not to mention deep fear at doing brake work).

My reasoning for going to the dealer is that the last 3 alignments I had done
were done by folks other than the dealer and they were not done well. So my
primary reason for going was the alignment, tire rotation &amp; balance I added in
because they'd be off anyway. They checked my front pads and said they were in
great shape (curiouser and curiouser!). I did not by tone or inference let
them know I wanted the &quot;royal treatment&quot;.... such as it is.

Now the Volksdoktor job can be done TWICE with different parts each time and
still be the same as the VW dealer price with aftermarkets, AND the warranty
over the 2 jobs adds up to that given by the VWD for OEM stuff. I have also
had decent service from these guys in the past. For the person wanting to know
about the price of the electricity and water doors, I'll post that a little
later tonight.
