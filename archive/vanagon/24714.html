&gt; Does anyone want to guess what the gas for this trip is gonna cost?  Let's
&gt; say (to make things easy for *ME* from near the San Francisco area).  Let's
&gt; take paramaters like:
&gt; 
&gt; getting not very good gas mileage
&gt; having to pay high rates for gas, especially outside the US, with the exchange
&gt;      and with the gas price monopoly which must exist on the legs of the
&gt;      trip where gas is not very often available

Shelley and I spent $572 on gas on our 7,800 mile GNATT trip.  We had
pretty good conditions though - i.e. highway miles and cheap gas, most
of the time.  I would set aside a minimum of $800 for the Alaska trip.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone want to suggest how much money to save ahead for food?  I
&gt; realize that this might seem obvious (just figure out what you spend
&gt; now), but eating in the camper on the road can cost quite a bit
&gt; different than eating at home.  Let's assume just sort of &quot;average&quot; tastes
&gt; and spending habits, like not eating out more than once a week, not eating
&gt; beef wellington and lobster tails for dinner, and so forth  :)

I think food will cost considerably less than gas on this trip.  Still,
I would set aside at least $500 for food (or around $20/day).
