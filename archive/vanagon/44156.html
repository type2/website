 Eric Rainey asked about the &quot;official&quot; Troubleshooting Guide for AFC Fuel
Injection- I have a manual for Type 1 (1976), VW 42-00-5954-1, but the same
protocols would apply to later or Type 2 vehicles- the inside cover lists
an order # of
42-00-5955-1 for the Type 2 manual.  Good flow charts of what to check in
what order......  MB
