Hmmm, lessee.  Possibilities are:
5th injector flooding engine
ignition wire opens when hot
coil opens when hot
AFC/fuel pump sticks when hot
intake leak screws up fuel/air mix
aux air reg stays open when hot, screwing up air/fuel mix

These are places to check but obviously the engine wouldn't run run worth 
a darn, if at all, if any of these items were the cause of the problem.  
But then I've seen some pretty creative work arounds to basic problems...

PS -- didn't someone mention a wire that needs to be connected at the 
starter in the last couple of days?  Seems that without it the engine 
won't catch at all.  Possibly this wire makes poor contact at high(er) 
temps.
