Subject: [81 2.0L] Deck Height and CC's Measured! (long)

Hi Folks!

I just measured my deck heights, as best I could.  I used the
socket-extension and feeler gauges method, pretty much exactly
as shown in the Wilson book.  I cut up some galvanized pipe
for spacers, and didn't really torque the cylinder down,
since I value my cooling fins :)  I would rather have used
the 'fake head' method, a la Bob Hoover,  but the logistics 
are too much without a second car.

Apparently the Type 4 engines, or mine anyway, use a steel
(as opposed to paper) 'gasket' between the cylinder and engine 
case, so I don't think there's much compression of that gasket 
to worry about.

I found an interesting
range of deck heights, as Bob predicted, and in fact found substantial
variation around the edges of each piston (these pistons have a deep
(3/4cm?) dish in the middle of them).  These differences turn out
to be insignificant wrt the final compression ratio.

The deck heights were:

1: .036-.038
2: .030-.034
3: .026-.034
4: .028-.030

The minimal to maximal volume above the piston, with a bore of
3.695 (or so) inches, counting the head gasket (type 4, .030&quot; thick), 
but not counting the volume of the head, is .6 in^3 to .73 in^3, 
a 22% variation.

I cc'd the heads today, using a 60ml (milliter = cc) syringe
a chemistry professor friend provided.  I measured with the
spark plugs in place since I want a realistic (as opposed to
simply consistent) result, so I can compute the compression.

The volume of each head is within 1 ml of 50 ml; I'd say they're
undetectably different, given the tools I'm using.  That's 
3.051 in^3.

Finally, I measured the hole in the top of _1_ piston at 15ml
(should have done more but my syringe is getting to be just
about useless - it doesn't like mineral spirits, and I don't
like rust), or .92in^3.

Bentley doesn't bother to give the stroke for the '80-'83 1/2
engines, but according to my Chilton's (yeah, right), it's
2.8 inches.  The cylinder volume displaced by the piston
is therefore 30in^3, giving a compression ratio between:

   3.05 + .92 + .6               3.05 + .92 + .73
--------------------    and    ---------------------
30 + 3.05 + .92 + .6           30 + 3.05 + .92 + .73

which is from 7.56:1 to 7.38:1, fairly reasonable given that
Chilton's claims that my compression ratio should be 7:1.

The overall variation is about 2.4 percent, unless those
piston holes (whatever you call 'em!) vary by a LOT more than
that...

Should I be concerned about my overly high compression ratio,
or just assume that Chilton's is wrong?  Any ideas?  Comments?
Hope this is of some interest to someone!!!
