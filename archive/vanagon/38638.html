While travelling in Mexico recently, I met a Westy owner who belonged to the
above organization.  Would appreciate hearing from anyone who belongs to it and
their comments, expecially the part where each member offers other members, for
one night, a space (and possibly an electrical outlet) to another Club member
who is passing through your region.

Mexico - VW heaven.  Gott, every second car seems to be a beetle or a bus.
