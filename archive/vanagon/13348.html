Subject: Re: West Marine catalog review!

Dan, if you're in heaven reading the catalog, just wait until you
set foot inside the store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :)  It's unbelievable!
Most of their best things are to be seen in person in the store,
in the Oakland one, at any rate.  All those beautiful brass
things like lanterns, heaters, lots of things to cook and BBQ
with, etc.  I recommend this place HIGHLY!  

Further, it gets me to thinking that there are obviously a lot
of items useful from the marine industry to us in the &quot;rv/camp&quot;
category, and vice-versa.  Check out a store or catalogue called
Camperland.
