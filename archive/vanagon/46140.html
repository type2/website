Subject: Tires

I too have been searching for a good set of tires for the Westy, but 
without any honest reviews I am lost.  There is a really good website 
for tires at 
			http://www.tirerack_dot_com/

They have some Continental CR21 tires for $53.  The man said they are 
reinforced.  Has anyone ever tried these?  All other reinforced tires I 
have found start at about $70.  

Angela &amp; I are going to be taking a very long road trip (Georgia to 
Missouri to Colorado to Arizona mightstop by California and then back 
home to Georgia :) so if anyone could recommend a good tire PLEASE do 
so.

Good Luck to all of you!
Thanks!
