Subject: Retail Price of an '87 Vanagon GL??

All,

I'm looking at an '87 Vanagon GL and was wondering if anyone can tell me the
&quot;Book Price&quot; of this Critter.  It has dual A/C, Alloys, 4sp, cruise, 114K mi,
Weekender rear seat (did all '87s have this?) and is in real good condition.
 If you don't have the book price would appreciate your best guess as to what
it is worth...yes I know that varies from region to region....any input would
be appreciated.

Please E-mail direct.

Thanks,
Dan
