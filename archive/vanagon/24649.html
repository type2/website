&gt;        What I'm looking for now in a hurry is a starter as mine
&gt;seized on the *boat* trip over from Canada to Belgium (anybody
&gt;care to try and explain why it would seize while it's not even
&gt;running??)


Salt spray corrosion, or salt-laden mist.
That, plus the fact that it's a VW starter and they like to do that just
to p*ss you off, and remind you that you have a car with &quot;character&quot;.
