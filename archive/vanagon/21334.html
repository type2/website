Subject: Re: Seeking '72 Westy hammock



Hey Schwarzemeister,

He must be describing that canvas thing that came with my bus I
sold you...maybe you could recoup a couple bucks?

&gt; I'm looking for the hammock (don't know what else you'd call it) that
&gt; fits over the front seats in a '72 Westphalia.
&gt;
&gt; Currently there are two holes in each A pillar, and two others in each B
&gt; pillar.  I'm told that this thing fits in these holes, but beyond that,
&gt; I'm at a loss.
