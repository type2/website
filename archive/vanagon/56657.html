Subject: diesel muffler

Vanagon list,,

Has anyone replaced their diesel vanagon muffler with any other than stock 
muffler????

My muffler is shot...The local muffler shop that has done custom work for me 
thinks he can put a 6&quot; round 20&quot; long muffler under the van with no porblems?

					Thanks again  Brian 82 dsl.
