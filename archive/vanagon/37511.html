Subject: Re: ARCHIVES: Propane fill valve repair

Thanks for that info.....reminds me that my tank is leaking slightly at 
the on/off valve. Doesn't leak when fully open or closed, just in the 
middle. Propane sprays out as I open and then stops when fully open. Is 
there a rebuild kit for the valve? Or should I look for a used tank?
Tanks a lot (:-) in advance.

&gt; the installation of this kit fixed my leaking fill valve that would 
&gt; spray propane back out that tiny pin-hole.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; today i received and installed the propane fill valve rebuild kit.
&gt; &gt; thanks go to Derek for the tip on this one.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; the kit consists of 4 O-rings, a small inlet screen and a *very*
&gt; &gt; small amount of lubricant.  for those of us that have had problems
&gt; &gt; with propane leaking back out after a fill, this _may_ be the ticket,
&gt; &gt; time will tell.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; the fill valve itself is a simple affair (well, as simple as affairs
&gt; &gt; go) basically held together by 4 screws in the cover.  i rebuilt mine
&gt; &gt; with the valve removed from the tank but it would be possible to do
&gt; &gt; it with the valve still attached, just harder to get everything clean.
&gt; &gt; rebuild consists essentially of cleaning the old grease out and
&gt; &gt; installing and lubricating the new o-rings.  pretty cake stuff and a
&gt; &gt; nice set of instructions are included with the kit.  oh, when you get
&gt; &gt; that special enclosed grease on your finger ready to greeze (as we
&gt; &gt; say in the woods) everything up-- don't wipe yer nose and lose the
&gt; &gt; grease... there's enough to do the job, period.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; here's the scoop:
&gt; &gt; PN V20128  PISTON O-RING KIT W/LUBE
&gt; &gt; avail from Manchester Tank 800/877-9923
&gt; &gt; cost $4.01 per kit (a veritable bargain)
&gt; &gt; COD's done over the phone but it cost me over $9 for shipping/COD
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; note:  the invoice says &quot;THIS IS A ONE TIME ONLY SALE PLEASE CONTACT
&gt; &gt; YOUR LOCAL DISTRIBUTOR (yeah, right.  in northern MN?) FOR FURTHER
&gt; &gt; ORDERS.&quot;  so do it once and do it big!
