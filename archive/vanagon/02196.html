Subject: Re:  Late nighter's and early risers (trip talk)

I would suggest that we have it very well fixed in advance where we
will stay each night.  Then people can get from one night's location
to the next as they see fit.  Thus stragglers wouldn't be any
problem.  Also I would recommend keeping the day trips perhaps
somewhat shorter that you might think, in order to take up this and
other kinds of slack.
