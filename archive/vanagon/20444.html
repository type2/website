To All:

Being a law abiding citizen, a tax-paying geezer, a veteran of the bullshit
wars and a lot of other neat things, I never have trouble with public safety
officials... unless they're in the mood (which appears to be most of the
time).  But I also ride a motorsickle, which as every cop knows is de facto
evidence of wrong-doing.

I have heard that the presence of a cell-phone and video camera, both in use,
have a remarkable effect on the attitude of police officers.

As for law enforcement and illegal substances, here in southern California a
good deal of white powder gets transported via limo.  Driven within the law
by a uniformed driver with a distinguised looking older passenger in the
back, there is never any probable cause for either a stop or search, whereas
any bunch of surfers headed for the beach is fair game.

Justice has nothing to do with law.  Or with law enforcement.

-Bob
