Richard, or anyone else for that matter....

I know there has been some discussion regarding a V_at_L bumper sticker...
could someone whip one up before 12/30??

The reason why I'm askin' is that we will be in France this January and
Ihave booked a T4 Caravelle for the first two weeks of our trip, and o
I (excuse the typo...) figured that a V_at_L sticker would be a nice
touch. Besides, we will be driving thru northern Italy, Switzerland,
Freyburg, Mulhouse, and Grenoble in the T4. Who knows maybe it would
attract some new listmembers.

Just a thought....(hint..hint..)  8)

Ric
