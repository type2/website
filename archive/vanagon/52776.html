Subject: Aux Heater??
From: &lt;mac.chen_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com&gt;

I am a new member to this list and a new vanagon owner (84 westy), so 
please excuse what may be a stupid question...I have a green knob on 
the dash to the right of the steering column.  From what I can tell 
from the owners manual and Bentley, this is the control for the 
auxiliary heater , or heater booster as its called in Bentley (82-12).  
I do get air out of the vents behind the front seats, but its not warm. 
 My question is, is this heater a common option, as I haven't seen much 
mention of it anywhere in the list archives, and is it worth it to try 
to get it working?  It looks pretty complex and possibly dangerous if 
not working properly.  I seem to keep pretty warm when driving just 
using the front and rear heat, and am reluctant to use a system that 
uses fuel from the fuel tank.  Just what is the theory behind this 
thing?  The owners manual says to only use it for 10 minutes with the 
engine not running, and indeed there is a timing circuit on the switch. 
 Anyone have any experience regarding this situation?

Also-I just had a new 2.1 installed.  I found a complete, brand new 
engine (exhaust to injectors) for sale for a song and dance, and 
couldn't resist.  My old 1.9 is available, ran fine but was leaking 
coolant when replaced.  History is unknown, other than 1985 1.9 which 
was installed the month before I bought the Westy.  Has complete 
exhaust in good shape.  Possible good rebuild project or core trade in. 
 e-mail me if anyone interested.  The wife says get rid of it.  Located 
near D.C., so pickup/delivery/inspection during Mid-Atlantic Holiday 
Fest available.
Thanks to all-  Scott
