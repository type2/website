Subject: Re: Bad starting

&gt;After cleaning and changing the ground strap, the battery connectors,
&gt;and the battery at last my strating problem continue.

Did you also check the ground strap on the transmission?

&gt;It has begin this summer, I turn the ignition key and nothing except
&gt;the fuel pump humming. There is only a click in the starter that can
&gt;be heard from behind (I mean by someone near the starter). After a
&gt;boosting the engine starts everytime.
&gt;
&gt;Is someone have an idea to were I should search. The alternator is
&gt;suppose to give 12.5 volts (this summer after a test after another
&gt;bad starting).
Don't rule out a problem with the alternator, 12.5 volts is not great.
Recheck it with a good battery, should be over 13 and somewhere in the area
of 13.6 after it's run for awhile. If you can give me a few more symptoms I
may be able to offer more suggestions.
&gt;Thanks
