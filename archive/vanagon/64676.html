Subject:      90 Vanagon temp light flashing, needle ok- HELP

Any response appreciated.  On the road and my 90 Carat engine temp
warning light started to flash rapidly.  Gauge needle reads just above
half or 3/4- normal for this car for the last 50000 miles.

Which can I believe, or is there a reason for the condition that might
be known?  It has never done this before.

Thanks in advance,

Ed
90 Carat 120k miles
