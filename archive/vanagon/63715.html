Subject: JB Weld Status Report

i've been promising to write this for a while as several people contacted
me recently with their questions and experiences.

about a year and a half ago i repaired my corroded heads using JB Weld (see
the FAQ in the archives).  several others have also done so.  with one
brief exception, the repair has worked perfectly.  i didn't record the
mileage when i did this but as of today it has 191K miles on the original
heads/motor and is running well.  i loose zero coolant.  for the cost of a
set of gaskets and much self labor, it has been a worthwhile repair.

the Exception:  this last spring i saw weeping from the heads.  i twitted
out.  confessed to Gerry (only) and felt all was for nought.  the weeping
lasted about 2 days (the heads AND me) and then mysteriously stopped as it
had started.  never seen nor smelled anything since.  maybe some gunk (i'd
used prodigious amount of leak sealer prior to the repair) got loose and
plugged it up.  i dunno.  i'm satisfied now that the repair is still intact
and things are well.

i'm currently in the midst of flushing and cleaning the cooling system with
PRestone Super Cleaner.  it can run in the system for 3-6 hours over a
period of 10 days.  this *may* liberate some old stop leak and it may start
leaking if that's what stopped my weeping earlier.  if it starts leaking
again, i *might* bring it public.... &lt;g&gt;  then again.....
