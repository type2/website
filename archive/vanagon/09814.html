So Dan Houg says:
&gt; chattering blades is to place the jaws of a cresent wrench on the 
&gt;  flat part of the wiper arm and 'adjust' the blade so that it is perpendicular
&gt;  to the glass.  This gives the blade the choice (free-will for wipers!) of 
&gt; flipping either direction depending on the sweep.
&gt; 
&gt; I know you know you knew this already, right?
&gt; Dan H.
&gt; 

Yeah, but do I want to do this?  I don't want to lose too much pressure
of the blade against the window or it will not give a good wipe.  I'll
play with the adjustment and see.
