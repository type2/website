	Ok! I've made a reservation for Steven Johnson (and party) and myself
(and party) at Pfeiffer Big Sur. Cost was $34.74 for Friday and Saturday
night, but the second vehicle will cost $6 extra a night, collected there.

	As I remember this camp site, there are some wonderful-looking 
trails on the hills just east of the site, so if the weather is clear,
I'm definately bringing my hiking shoes.

	Still relying on the same memories, the beach access is a
bit north on the highway, and then a fair hike from the road. However,
its a wonderful beach, and if we get there, I promise I'll teach how to
make and play bull-kelp horns.

	Should we make Friday dinner a pot-luck to get to know everyone
in person?
                              _
         Be there or be ---&gt; |_| ?
