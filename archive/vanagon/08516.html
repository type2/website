Jeff,
For what its worth the NADA book for the Northwest region (Seattle) list the
87 Camper GL at $ 7,175 Trade In; $ 6,475 Loan; and $ 9,025 Retail; add $ 650
if its a syncro, and subtract $ 500 if its a diesel.
These books are regional (suposedly) so, It might not be a completly accurate
pricing.
Oh, that was the list from the December 1994 edition.
Hope it helps.

Matt Rathke, City of Seattle
