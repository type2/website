Subject: warning about netiquette and repost of errant message

This message was sent to the list with an entire copy of a message that 
was posted in the same afternoon.  Just a warning to everyone not to 
quote entire messages.  We all saw the previous message if you're posting 
that fast.

Here's what happened and why it went to me:

&quot; A message with Message-Id: &lt;199405202041.NAA11745_at_IO.NOSC.MIL&gt; (appearing
  in the body) matches entries in the list's .message.ids file. &quot;

Just keepin' ya all in line, now. :-)
