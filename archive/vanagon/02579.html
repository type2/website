Scott finds that its hard to cook on his engine especially with
luggage in the luggage compartment...now THERES another advantage
to owning a EuroVan....Besides the intake manifold is curved in
a &quot;C&quot; shape....so you can rest your dindin right there and won't
have to worry about overcooking!!  8-)
