Subject: Syncro FS Nor Cal $6200.00

Listees,

  I'm re-posting this due to the fact that I STILL Have it!  I'd like to sell it to 
someone that could use it.

  I have a seven passenger Syncro for sale.  Here's a list of work that has been done
within the last month preparing it for sale;

  Head Gaskets
  Front Axles
  Rear Brakes With Drums
  Front brakes with Rotors
  Complete tune-up

  Asking $6200.00

  I bought this van to part-out, it turned out to run so well and not look that bad
that I decided to keep it in one piece.

  This van runs very well.  It has been in a Hail Storm and has suffered some dings.
This van would be a great van for someone living in the Mountains or city that needs a
Syncro and doesn't want to worry about every nick and scratch.

  I have a Pic of it and will e-mail to anyone that's interested.  If you want more
info, e-mail me OR call me and I'm more than happy to answer your questions.

  Kyle
