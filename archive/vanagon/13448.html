Hi all

My problems are as follows:-

1.  Rebuilt motor, new clutch.  My car will not idle, gets hot (my
    carburettor sweats just on the bottom), leaks oil (one from rear main 
    seal other from left hand side tappet cover, even though cover, gasket 
    has been changed twice), slight problem with the car kind of surging and 
    also seems like it is floodong (petrol) but it is not flooding.  Any help
    appreciated.

TTFN

Tracey
