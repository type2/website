Robert, your pinion bearing has failed. Avoid driving the van too much as the
inner bearing will self destruct and take out the ring and pinion when it
gives up the ghost.The trans needs ohaul.I have found generally that the
german syncros hold up 4/ever if shifted properly(dont,...i repeat...dont let
any shop put in brazilian garbage syncros.They will not last 5k miles.Most of
the other inner bearings last 4 ever.Good luck
