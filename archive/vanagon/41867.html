Subject: [Syncro PS] Which fluids are best?


John, thanks for the posting on fluids, my problem is below.

&gt;Power steering: early any ole Dexron Mercon ATF, late the same
&gt;import guy sells Pentosin made Audi/VW compatible fill for $10/qt.
&gt;Beats the crap out of VW price on their &quot;hydraulic oil&quot; surely though
&gt;never mix ATF and the later stuff.

Sheee-it!  Lemme try this on you. '87 with PS, I flushed the system with STP 
ATF Dexron-III and left in in for a two months.  Got rid of nasty squeal 
from pump immediately, and got rid of brown cloudy fluid too.  ATF was 
thicker. It was a thorough flush, pumped out until ATF was running into dump 
bottle. 
        So... Last week the rack seals failed. No idea exactly when this 
happened, the boots are so tightly sealed that they are holding all the 
leaked ATF, including yesterdays 1/2 litre top up, which pump out in an hour.

  Any idea if some incompatibility exists between Pentosin soaked seals and 
ATF I used? I noticed the pump burping and the rack belching air under me 
after getting way over sideways while offroading the Syncro. Sank the 
drivers side deep in a stream bed, which meant the PS reservoir may have 
sucked air for a while.  It was all perfect just prior, and level was fine 
&lt;1 week ago. Was getting ready to flush out and replace with the $34 tin of 
Pentosin from the dealer I bought a while back, grrr.  Oh, the manual 
specifies 'ATF-Dexron' no other rating, ie/ -II or Mercon or type F. Any 
chance air could have somehow blown/cut the seals? TIA Tim Smith
