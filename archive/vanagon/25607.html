So Steve Tokar says:

&gt; Hi, I'm new to the list, so pardon me for asking the obvious. 
&gt; 
&gt; We've had our 71 bus since 1983. The last engine rebuild seems to be holding
&gt; up well. It's a homemade semi-camper conversion with a sleeping platform and
&gt; a sink. We car camp out of it.  I love it, but I'm tired of the low power,
&gt; high noise and being buffeted by every breeze. Also the steering will need
&gt; replacement soon.


I think Mr. Bradley 'P' has a deal for you.  Especially if you're in
the vicinity of the Bay Area.  (California, that is).
