Subject: More short in '73 bus
Date: Thu, 21 Dec 1995 08:51:26 -0600 (CST)

First I want to say thanks for all of the helpful hints from the 
questions a couple of days ago.  For those of you keeping score at 
home the patient is a '73 bus that has a battery that will go dead in 
about 24 hours, it is new.  There is a short somewhere in the system 
as evidenced by a tiny spark when you attach the battery ground strap.

We thought we had it narrowed down to the fuse that runs the park 
lights.  We removed and cleaned all the bulbs and sockets and replaced
a couple of questionable bulbs.  We still had the spark.  So we went 
back to checking one fuse at a time and still found a spark each time.
&gt;From this we concluded that the short was not going through the fuse 
box.  We then unplugged the juice to the headlight switch, regulator 
and coil, one at a time.  Still a spark.  This is where we sit.  The 
only other electrical components on the thing are the starter circuit 
and the generator.  All of their wires look good.  Could it be in one 
of these and how would you go about checking them?  We are at a real 
dead end here.  We might have done better but at 11 pm and 20 degrees 
we called it quits.  Thanks, Jim
