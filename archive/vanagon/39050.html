&gt;Oh, I'm sorry, I guess drug use isn't part of the Dead Head 
culture.  I
&gt;guess that all the people I've ever known who were &quot;into the Dead&quot; 
lied
&gt;when they talked about all the drugs they took.  Nor did kids who 
wanted to
&gt;be part of the the &quot;Dead family&quot; take drugs to really enjoy the 
experience.
&gt;And I guess several close friends of mine from high school didn't 
screw
&gt;their lives up because of their drug influenced invlovement with 
being dead
&gt;heads. I apologize, my mistake.  Maybe they drive type IIs down in
&gt;Medelline.
&gt;

I find your angry diatribe against Dead Heads both offensive and 
inappropriate for this list.  While I am sorry to hear about the 
close friends to whom you refer, to make sweeping criticism about 
any large group of people based on experience with a few is nothing 
more than stereotyping and prejudice.  As such, it reveals more 
about the person who makes such comments than it does about the 
targeted group.

Based on the higher than average percentage of deadheads who drive 
Volkswagens, I would guess that there more than a few deadheads, or 
friends of deadheads, on this list. We all share a love for a 
common hobby.  While the periodic off-the-subject threads provide 
welcome variety, in my opinion they should be limited to those  
that are not devisive, political, or may otherwise be offensive to 
some list members.  There are other, more appropriate places for 
that sort of venting.
