Here's what I do know for sure.
I observed a roadside (yes, from a fixed location) 
dyno smog test on a front wheel drive vehicle.  Extra fan pointed to 
the front of the vehicle to assist in cooling.  This was in Auburn, 
California, on April 29th.  Auburn is about 60 miles NE from Sacramento.

Next day, in the Auburn paper, front page no less, is an article 
about the situation.  Tid bits included in the article include the 
following:

Its called a &quot;roadside emissions survey&quot;
They use it to get &quot;real world&quot; emission readings.
Drivers are obligated to stop when directed by the CHP.
Drivers are NOT required to participate, though the CHP will strongly 
encourage them to do so.  CHP will not easily divulge the fact 
that one can refuse to participate.
There are two teams of ASE certified Smog Check Techs doing the work.
The two teams will visit 138 surface street locations for several months.
They will check until they get 4300 tests.
Locations and dates of the testing are kept confidential.

Info provided from the Department of Consumer Affairs by Paula David 
for the article.
The Dept of Con Aff/Bureau of Auto Repair along with the Air 
Resources Board and the CHP are conducting the survey.

I have the article at work (email), pmail if more details desired.

  Where did Austin get his information that the CHP is randomly pulling
cars over to perform a smog check?  It is patently illegal for the CHP to
randomly pull over a vehicle to perform any kind of check on our vehicles. 
All random stops must be made at a fixed location, such as for &quot;drunk
driving&quot; checkpoints.  

  I would appreciate being notified of the details by anyone who has been
randomly stopped.  After I get some examples, I will research the issue and
tell people what to do in the event of a random stop.  Or, I might even do
a class-action lawsuit to prevent the CHP from making random stops.  

  Thank you everybody.  I hope this message goes to all.

&gt; Jeff, in what part of Cal did you observe these checks being performed?
