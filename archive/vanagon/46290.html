&gt; 
&gt; Let's suppose &quot;someone&quot; wanted to pack while on the Alaskan Hwy. Let's also
&gt; suppose that it's illegal to carry firearms into Canada. How does &quot;someone&quot;
&gt; get the weapons (protectors of the ass) into Alaska? What are the applicable
&gt; laws? What permits are required?


You need to FLY into Alaska, bringing your firearms with you; OR,
have your local FFL dealer ship them to a FFL dealer in Alaska for you to pick up 
at when you get there. You WILL have to fill out another *YELLOW SHEET* when you 
get it :&gt;(


&gt; I personally have as many weapons as I have skateboards...

Thats ALL? ;&gt;)

Have Fun.
