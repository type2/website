&gt; 	I've found a '70 bus and since I've seen that the collective

&gt; hoping I could get some comments.  The bus (I'm told-I haven't seen
&gt; it yet) has 73k miles, one owner, clean interior, straight body, good
&gt; paint, no rust (that I've gotta see), decent engine (I've already got
&gt; two of those, one is in pieces), good tranny (I've got one of those
&gt; too) and I forget what else.     Price $2,000.00

Personal opinion: If it REALLY has no rust and is straight and runs well, 
it's worth $2000 easy. You can buy one with problems for $700 and put 
$1300 into or.... 8) Joe
