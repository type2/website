Subject: Re: List Split Announcement [IMPORTANT]

I'm tossing in one more waste of bandwidth,
 
Back in the old days I followed the newsgroups too, back
when it was rec.autos.vw, THE ONLY MAKE WITH A REC.AUTOS
address I note, not in another subtier, then came the evil
H20 vs Air-sucker battle, 2 newsgroups, now both suck IMHO.
Frankly from both sides you would get a lot of hints and tips.
An engine is an engine, a person who rebuilds one, often
has tips about rebuilding the other, bodywork is bodywork,
interior is interior.  Unless we post carefully, many questions
that had been being answered will now get lost.  This I fear.

I'm done, I know it has to happen, I can realize the logistics.

John
