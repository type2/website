Subject: Re: Kelly Park Show - April 9th

&gt;On April 9th at Kelly Park just outside of downtown San Jose there is a VW
show, 
&gt;probably one of the first in No-Cal for the season.  (Last weekend there was a 
&gt;SOTO meet in Long Beach, but I heard it was pretty small.)

&gt;If anyone needs more details, let me know.  I've got the flyer at home and can 
&gt;relay all of the info.

I'd love more details on this.  Do people sell Vans there?  Or just parts?

Ron
