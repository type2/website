&gt;Have 87GL w/rear heater and no manual, only the Bentley which can't help

This isn't exactly what you asked, but FYI...

On the left side of the rear heater box (as you look down on it), there is
a slot.  In the slot is a lever that moves back and forward.  Move this
lever towards the rear of the van to cut off the rear heater.  Move it
towards the front of the van to enable operation of the heater.
