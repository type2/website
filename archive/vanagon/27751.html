Subject: Re: 96mm Jugs for 1700

&gt;A guy at the FLAPS has a set of pistons he says are for a 1700 - they are 
&gt;96mm but don't require any flycutting of the head.

&gt;Anyone ever use these?  The bottom end should be strong enough since the rod 
&gt;journals are reduced for the 2000 engine.  Are these a good thing?

These would be the infamous NPR brand which do seem to have a pretty terrible
word of mouth reputation.  The walls are thin and the bottom of the jug which
slips into the case is less than 1 mm thick from memory.

BUT having said that my own personal experience with these kits is not that
bad (I run one in a 1700 motor and I have a mate who also has one). While I am
not expecting to get the longeivity that I would out of a stock P&amp;C kit I
don't think this one looks like is going to die *really* quickly (it has 35000
k on it now and uses no oil and compression is good).  I will stick my neck
out, put my nomex suit on and say that I don't think running these things on a
Type IV has the same dire consequences that running them on a Type I seems to
have, perhaps due to the 'superior' cooling, oil filtration and case strength
of the Type IV.  I will qualify this statement by saying both these kits were
hand picked at purchase, weighed and mic'ed so they could be balanced to a
fine tolerance and were built into fully balanced and blueprinted engines...

The kit will give you a whopping extra 2311cc in capacity (to around 19100cc
from memory) and is probably the biggest bang for buck you can get with a
1700.

You will have to do something with your heads - your 'small' valved 1700 heads
are no going to feed this displacement all that well.  I think I've posted
hard-to-read diatribes on the subject of big bore kits and Type IV heads a
couple of times before.....I'm not sure that anyone is ready for a repeat 8-).
