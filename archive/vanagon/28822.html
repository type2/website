Subject: Re: 65 UnEarthing - how/where to attach drag chain?

Since it will be the wheels that are resisting, how close to them can you 
get with a strap or length of chain? Then tie onto that on each side.  I 
tore the rear bumper out of my '72, bedded into leaves and dirt. It had a 
flat and two frozen drums, (but I had a Syncro!) Tim
