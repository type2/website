Subject: ROOF RACKS


Santa Clause brought me some Thule roof racks for my van!!!

They will be mounted using some Yakima brackets that are designed to be
attached via bolts to the fiberglass poptop.

My question for the day is....

What kind of load can the poptop handle?

Thanks in advance for your replies
