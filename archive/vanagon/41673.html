Subject: EV Cooling Weirdness

On the way to work this morning (about 8 miles) the EV never got above 1/4
up the scale. This is very strange.  Outside temps are normal (68F), no
smoke, no warning lights, plenty of coolant. 

Also, just as I got to work, the needle jumped almost to 1/2 but then 
went right back down to 1/4.  I should not that I had the A/C off so,
the cooling fans were NOT running.

What do yall think?

Is the thermostat going?

Thanks,
Trace Choulat
