Subject: Rusty needs poptop hold-down items.

Does anyone on the list wish to sell the four stationary holders and the
rubber &quot;T&quot; handles that retain the poptop on the '65-'67 Westfalias? I am
getting to the point where I will beneeding these puppies. Does anyone know
if the &quot;T&quot; handles are being repopped anywhere? Are the items that hold down
the typical Baja or VW Thing hoods the same item? What do y'all use?
I know that a few folks have been parting out some Westies of this vintage
recently.

Your help is truly appreciated. (I take back everything I ever said about
you) ;)
