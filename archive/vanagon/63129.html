Subject:      86 7-pass FS in Knoxville, TN

I just wanted to thank all of you on the v_at_l list for your outpouring of
support concerning the 86 7-pass that I located.

Despite and because of this, I am a-gonna pass on this gem.  I've decided
to get into the running for a '99 beetle instead. :)

Anyhow, it's still for sale!  The skinny:

'86 Vanagon GL Wagon.  Blue/blue.  A/C. 4-spd.

-It does not leak.  Except for exhaust.
-Has new Michelins.
-A/C blows cold.
-Little body dings, one or two scuffs.  But no rust, original paint in
good shape.
-Interior dingied due to 4 kids, but with a steam cleaning...
-Carpet torn in places, probably salvageable.
-Dash not sun-cracked.
-160,000 miles (In GOOD shape for this mileage!)

The owner is trading this and a 325i convertible for a new Dodge king-cab.
He will take delivery in October of his truck, and the trade value of the
VW is $3k.  He would rather a VW lover buy it than for it to end up in a
RedNeck CarLot somewhere.  So prudence is nessecary.

His name is John Snyder, lives is Seymour, TN.  (Outside Knoxville)

Have fun!
