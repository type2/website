Subject:      Surging at Idle (2.1 Digifant)

On the principle that there is no such thing as a stupid question:

When I first start the engine, the revs first go to about 1500 rpm and
then promptly drop to about 1000 rpm where it begins surging between 950
rpm and 1050 rpm on about one second intervals. After the engine warms
up, the idle settles down to a respectable 950.

What causes the surging?
Is there a simple explanation/cure?
Is it anything to concern myself about?
