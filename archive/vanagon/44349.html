Subject: re vdo cyl head temp sensor location?

&gt;
&gt;just got news from the mechanic that my van is alive again after a full
&gt;rebuild! :)  the problem is that he can't find the sensor attached to the vdo
&gt;cyl head temp guage.  he says there was no sensor in the heads he
&gt;removed, i always thought the sensor was a ring that went around a
&gt;spark plug from what i heard on the list, bu he can't find that either.  this
&gt;is a puzzle to me, the guage worked fine.  i know nothing about it, as it
&gt;was installed by a po.  any clues?
&gt;

It is a copper ring, on a short piece (6 inch) of stiff braided
two-conductor wire. you can mount them on one of the head bolts, or on the
spark plug. (Mine's on the plug, where it supposedly gets a slightly hotter
reading.)
It has a plastic plug on the other end where it connects to the wire coming
from the gauge.
If he did lose it, you can get them mailorder for about $10. I just picked
some place out of the back of one of the mags, don't remember the name
anymore.
