Subject: Happy about tires now.

Just to follow up on last week's tire story.  As before, my tire store 
replaced the Michelin XZX 185R14 tires with 185R14 C without a whimper.  For 
those of you in Seattle area this is Evan's Tire in Lynnwood.

Prior to replacement we had developed a wobble (steering wheel pulls first 
one way then the other) synchronized with tire rotation.  At some higher 
speeds it felt like a tire out of balance.  I told my wife it was likely an 
old tire out of round (the front tires were 5 1/2 year old 50k+ mi. Michelin 
XZX 185R14C).  Sure enough with the new tires the wobble is gone.  I was 
about to write in asking about steering bushing symptoms.
