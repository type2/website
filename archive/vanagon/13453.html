Subject: 90 Oil Burner Help and update on my T2
From: alun jenkins &lt;alun_at_krypton.win-uk_dot_net&gt;


Hi all,
Havnt been around for a bit as Ive moved jobs and had to get
my own email address. Perhaps Joel could update my records. I
was alun_at_bacm.co_dot_uk but am now alun_at_krypton.win-uk_dot_net.
Now to my problem,
My 1990 1700 Diesel has 60000 miles on the clock, had a new
head gasket done at 40k but now is running rough at tick over
when cold. If it were petrol the description I would give is
its missing, once the motor warms up its sort of OK but power
seems to be way down and she smokes like a campfire ! This problem
has become progressivly worse over the last few weeks. I have
put new glows in and at least she starts now. Also after a good
long high speed run I get sparks of burning soot from the exhaust.
Is this injectors or head gasket or what ?
Thanks in advance
1990 T2 1700D camper (leisuredrive)
