Subject: Re: 84 Hatch Openers

ed said

&gt;PO was in Florida, west of Orlando, when he got the plastic piece that
&gt;extended the useful life of the original hatch openers.  I cannot find a
&gt;suitable replacement anywhere.  Anyone have a source for this piece which
&gt;bolts onto the metal rod and has a 5 inch plastic piece that you press
&gt;against the rod and lower the hatch until the top piece of the hatch
&gt;opener is stopped.  Should sell for less that $10.
&gt;
&gt;Assuming that I may not get a chance at the cheap fix I have priced new
&gt;hatch openers and I would like some sage advise based on the following
&gt;options
&gt;
&gt;VW Stabillis at Camelback AZ 1 yr warranty$41.85 X 2, no tax, $5 ship = 88.70
&gt;Strong Arms at local VW shop, 6 mo. warranty	$39.95 X 2, 6% tax = 84.69
&gt;Monroe at FLAPS	, 2 yr warranty		$28.75 X 2, 6% tax= 60.95
&gt;
&gt;Any reason not to do the Monroe which I understand are gas openers with
&gt;the longest warranty?   Seems like a slam dunk unless someone got burned.

I just bought a pair of the stabilus from volks cafe for $25.00 each. you
can reach them through their homepage at http://www.volks-motorsports_dot_com

the other piece you mentioned is available from J.C. Whitney for $6.99.
Part number 13BD4688T.They call it a Lift Support Repair Bracket
