Subject: '64 Single Cab questions 
Date: Sun, 17 Mar 1996 10:38:02 -0800 (PST)

I've finally got some time to spend on the Single and got it 
running again with the generator supplying voltage to the battery
to keep it charged.  Turns out the old battery ground cable I
slagged off the donor buggie from the PO just wasn't up to the
task.  So it now sports a shiney new one and starts up like a
charm.  

I futzed with the sheared bolt that's supposed to hold the 
battery cable by drilling out the middle and got off center 
and wasn't able to 'ease' it out.  Right now I'm just hitting
it with Liquid Wrench and will try other concoctions until I 
can persuad the tough little !_at_#$ outta there without ruining
the threads.  (fingers crossed)

I took it for a drive to make sure it did okay with Linda driving
in her Sentra for back-up.  Still have to fix the throttle cable
so that I get better response &amp; pick-up.  Linda reminded me about
the gas smell and I know I need to get the other tank in.  I'll
need to talk with Thom about cleaning up the tank as well as 
check the Bob sermon on it.

Pretty noisy, but that's because of all the holes and lack of
noise dampers and such.  Lot's of work to do....

I'll be fiddling with the tail lights today so I can warn tail-
gaters that I'm slowing down or stopping.  I don't think I'll
have the luxery of turn signals before I go to the DMV for them
to see that my VIN numbers are kosher (sp?).  

Speaking of fiddling.  I need to get to the back of the Speedo/
idiot light and need some info. on how to get at it and remove
it so I can replace/fix the idiot lights.  I don't know at this
point whether or not I should just chuck it and get another or
fix what I have.  I can see that the colored screens for the I.L.'s
are not there.  Are they tough to fix?  Or a piece-o-cake?  

Thanks for the inputs..
