Subject:      Type I stuff available from Austin Texas

All,

There is a guy here at work who is trying to shrink his collection of
vintage VW, and other auto parts.

He said that he has a '67 Beetle that ran as of last spring, and as far
as he knows it still runs. The only thing wrong with it is that there
are a few dings in the fenders, and the door panels are kind of worn.
The floor pans are solid, except for under the battery(surprise,
surprise, surprise - insert Gomer Pyle voice). I have not seen this mind
you, but am going on what he has told me.  Generally I trust him to be
honest with me.

He has some junk cases, and heads as well, primarily 1200 and 1300cc
engines, some may still be good. Unless someone wants some
questionable(at best) cases or heads, I guess as cores if nothing else,
they will go to the scrapper(I see some potential CCC torches).

This is in Austin Texas.

He says that he would rather see that the parts go to people who will
use them, rather than the local VW salvage yard, where they will be sold
for the highest price possible.  He is not too sure exactly what he has,
but will get a list together by next week.

For those who are interested in obtaining a list of what is available,
e-mail me direct and I will get a list out to you when it becomes
available. Especially those on the VintagVW list as we are not supposed
to be selling stuff on the list.

If anyone is interested in the non-vw stuff there are some antique cars,
pickups, and motorcycles that may be available, as well as parts for
them.

Cheers,

David
