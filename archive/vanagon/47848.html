Subject: A sad tale

	When I picked up my van from the shop yesterday I had noticed the
nice dent and scratch in the back. Well it turns out that one of the shop
guys had backed it into the yard fence
and two bolts hit the back hatch about a foot below the window.
	They were real good about the whole thing, and could see I was
erked, so after I get back from my excursion to Tofino, they'll kindly
repair the whole thing, and repaint the back hatch to avoid having two
tones of paint.
	And on an even sadder note, they'll have to take off my list
sticker to paint the hatch...and I dont have  spare. :( Anyone got an extra?

t-minus 43 hours till the mystery Machine departs for the trip o' my life
(to date).
