Subject: RE: Not overheating Kombi &amp; holidays

&gt;Turned out that the problem was not overheating but the Gene Berg 
&gt;dipstick temperature gauge (actually properly fitted to the case, not in 
&gt;the dipstick hole) was very pessimistic. A proper VDO gauge now fitted 
&gt;shows that Kombi was not overheating at all. Very frustrating for everyone 
&gt;involved.

OK I will admit to something similar but completely my fault-
I installed a VDO oil temp gauge in my 71 and was surprised to find out 
 that I was always about 250 degrees on the freeway, I spent a whole 
 year driving slow and taking lots of stops to keep the temp down. I 
 replaced all the engine compartment seals and checked the fan and the 
 cooling system. I was fanatical about inspecting and replacing the 
 sparkplug seals and keeping the fins clear of debris.
One day I was changing the oil and noticed the wire was a little loose 
 on the sending unit so I wiped the oil off with a rag and was getting 
 ready to crimp the fitting when I noticed a little 'c' with a degree 
 mark --- wait a minute didn't  the gauge have a 'f' on it ? a quick 
 check yes it was, DOH!  I replaced the sending unit with the proper 
 (Fahrenheit) and drove up the canyon, never broke 190 f , at least it 
 made me aware of all the nuances of VW cooling.
