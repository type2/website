Hi, Ralf

I'll assume you had a reasonably good time in San Jose 
(it's hard to tell from your post, but, being from SJ, all
I can say is that there are busses (SCSI and otherwise),
Vanagons, and Eurovans down here, so it can't be all
bad  :-)  ).

Anyway, tell us more about the Trans Canada Hwy!
My wife went across part of it when she got out of 
school many years ago, and she keeps telling me
that we (I) have to go across it before we (I) die.
Could you provide a cursory list of places to 
see/visit, enough to start planning a, oh, say,
7-10 day vacation? (Sorry, some of us are not for-
tunate enough to have tons of vacation or sabbaticals  :-(  )

Plus it'd give me a chance to check out some of those 
&quot;different&quot; Eurovans that a friend of mine was describing
after visiting BC last week.

ps-If you're in Canada and reading this, please feel free
to add to the travelogue, or e-mail me.  I'd really like
to find out more about traveling through Canada.
TIA
