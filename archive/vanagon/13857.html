Subject: Re: alcohol burner question

Yes, martha, I have two of these. Probably the same kind you might be
looking at in a Marine catalog--brand name of Orego or something like that. 

On this list I always know I am count on posts by you related to cool
camping equipment. 

Anyway, you need at least *two* of these Orego 5,000 heaters for operation
in winter (temps below 32 degrees) since they don't have enough BTU output
otherwise. 

Buying and using the alcohol fuel is somewhat expensive--like, for long
winter drives you might be paying, say 1/3rd again as much as you are for
gasoline on alcohol to run these heaters. 

Nevetheless, I like mine and use them some times in the winter. 

For overnight camping they are neat cause they run all night long. 

And yes, they put out moisture the same way that unvented catalytic heaters
do. Uk. But if you leave a window cracked it isn't so bad. 

If I had a non-watercooled van, I think these heaters are among the nicest
classiest, easiest ways to get heat.  --Fairly cheap too, in a way. 

I prefer to smell of these heaters to the smell of propane fuel being
burned. On the other hand, my wife prefers things the other way around. 

You can drive with Orego heaters going since they won't spill fuel even if
they tip over while lit--and they don't tip over cause they have very wide
bases. 

All in all, a viable alternative, possibly even be prefereable, to little
Coleman propane portable heaters. 

Not as good, however, as a vented catalytic heater a, la, dave garth.

&gt;Does anyone know much about alcohol burners?  Do they
&gt;produce as much condensation/moisture as propane?  What
&gt;about their consumption of oxygen?  Do they produce
&gt;as a byproduct of their combustion CO, the way that propane
&gt;does?  Therefore recommended to be ducted/vented?  Pros?  Cons?  
&gt;
&gt;thanks....
