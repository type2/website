&gt;&lt;&lt; The Ron and Chris Vanagon List fund-raising activity,  the program to
&gt; &gt;raise money for the cost of operation of the Vanagon List, seems to have
&gt; &gt;Friend Lussier passing the hat, frequently, in a supplicative manner. 
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  How's the effort going?  How much more to raise?,, maybe it's time for
&gt;those with a little more to offer a second helping....

Actually, I don't think that this will be necessary.  We're darn close to
our $2,000 goal.  If you haven't sent us a check and intend to, though,
it's very welcome :-)!
