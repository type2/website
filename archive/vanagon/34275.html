Subject: Re: atlantic pond challenge

&gt;If all of us could put together a rig attaching a boat to our vans, but
&gt;so that either could tow the other (the van towing the boat on land, and
&gt;the boat somehow carrying the van on water, obviously), then we could
&gt;literally go anywhere!  I haven't been able to solve yet the dilemma
&gt;of how to carry enough fuel in either/both to make the trip, but I'm

        Now now now. Didn't you see the James Bond flick where the
sportscar became a rocket launching submarine? So there you have it. You
need only replace you rubber seals with high quality Deutsch gummi, and
devise a screw modification for your engine. I'd suggest talking to Bob
Hoover about this, as his considerable experience in mounting a propellor
to a VW engine should be rather simular. Perhaps a removeable rear engine
lid, and a screw that bolts onto the flywheel? A couple of air tanks for
you and the engine to breathe, a snorkel to replenish, and -Voila!- The
submersible Westy!!  Quite simple really, and Bob Hoover and James Bond
have already done most of the complicated engineering...    ;-)

Peace,
