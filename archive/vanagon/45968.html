Subject: Re: Looking for support...[was Inuvik trip]

&gt;driveway. :-(  For a brief moment I convince myself that we could go
&gt;in the Thing...then Liz gives I that &quot;Yoohoo, reality is over here&quot;
&gt;look and I go back to staring at the '67 Resto from Hell's first
&gt;cousin [not wanting to steal any wind from VanBondo...I saw the
&gt;pics...he wins...though I am still convinced that Ras Split is between
&gt;25 and 30% body-fill].  This is the second trip I haven't been ready

I dunno, I think my '54 is a very strong contender in the &quot;Resto From Hell&quot;
contest.  Especially since I found out my front beam is welded on.  Been
stewing on that one all week...

Yours may bee 25-30% filler, but mine is 50-70% RUST!
