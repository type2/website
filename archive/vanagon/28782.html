Subject: Coolant Temp Indications

My coolant temperature indicators are intermittently screwed up.

I'm convinced that the engine is running at the right temperature.

However, as you go down the road, the gauge will sometimes show a 
mid-range reading and sometimes show a max temperature reading.  It never 
shows a min temp reading after warm-up.  Could this mean in intermittent 
dead-short or intermittent open?

The coolant temperature warning light sometimes flashes when the gauge 
needle is showing max temp, and sometimes when the needle shows normal temp.

Could these problems be caused by a defent in the solid-state device 
which is in parallel with the temp gauge and warnign light?

Or could it be caused by the cooland low level warning control unit?  I 
don't think so, but wonder.

I am sure the sending unit is not the problem and the motor is not 
overheating.
