Subject: Re: 95 EV-Winnebago fridge problems

Thanks for the tip on the fridge - we are about to leave
for Colorado and lotsa altitude - I might have had a fit
if the fridge didn't light.

I reported crazy door locks a long time ago.  After rain,
the door locks would cycle wildly.  Made it an adventure
trying to get inot the van.  Also made one cautious about
locking keys in the van inadvertently.  The dealer
replaced a switch in the driver's door.  No recurrence.

air

need 
&gt; to have a &quot;Vent Kit&quot; installed
&gt; Also, I read that others have had problems with the door locks going 
nuts, 
&gt; ever any resolution?
