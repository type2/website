And I'll be you thought there wasn't anything left to do!

Today I bought and installed new rubber for the cargo doors,
rear hatch, and engine lid.  $120 total, for the rubber, a license
plate fram and a pedal cover, and the rubber grommet for the
gas tank neck.

This stuff is not as easy to install as one would think.  First of all,
you have to know whether the rubber goes on the door or the bus...

D'oh!

Anyway, its nigh impossible to close the doors now, they are so tight.  I
had to trim the cargo door rubber in 4 spots where the hinges go, because
it was just too tight.  I trimmed some off the backside of the rubber, so the
front seal part remains intact.

Whats left to do?  I need to do some more detailing on the underbody (yuck!)
and figure out a headliner solution.  Thats it.  From here I can just
go into trinket mode.

I really want a radio, BTW.  Everyone that has them decides they want to
keep them :(
