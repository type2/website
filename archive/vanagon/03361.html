&gt;
&gt;My '87 Syncro still has the following problem:  after warming up,
&gt;at low rpms, there is very little power, and under load, seems to
&gt;switch between normal (a bit of power) and low-power mode, causing
&gt;a slight bit of jerking.
&gt;
OK, at the risk of being totally wrong and never to be taken seriously
again, this is my *guess*: there's something wrong with the vacuum part of
your distributor. At high rpm, the centrifugal advance will compensate for
the problem.
&gt;
&gt;One thing that struck me odd, is that the air and coolant temp sensors
&gt;have readings that are not equal in the morning when I assume that both
&gt;should have cooled to the ambient air temperature.
&gt;
temp gauges seem to always be off by a bit.
