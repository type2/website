Subject: RE: Blown Fuse Indicator


_______________________________________________________________________________
There's a better way.  It will take you a couple hours but it's
the sort of thing that never goes bad and never wears out. 
Here's how it works:  When you blow a fuse -- and even when one
is just loose -- you peek under the dash and there's this LED
glowing back at you.  The bad fuse is just above it.  You wiggle
it (if it's loose), replace it if it's bad and drive on.  No
mystery.  No fumbling.  Costs you mebbe two bucks.  Cheep.

    This is flat-out brilliant. THANK YOU!!!!!
 
    Michael
