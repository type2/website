Subject: stalling even after

Thanks to all who sent info regarding stalling vanagons(Haunted 84 hi top
camper) .  I have changed the coil, did the capacitor harness modification,
changed fuel filters, sensor two.
Problem still persists, but manifests itself slightly differently.  For the
last few days, since the new coil, it occasionally stumbles at mid range
throttle after running for a while, (12-15 mi) usually whem exiting the
freeway.  I can pump the gas, to get it to &quot;catch&quot;, then floor it, it
hesitates, then takes off to full throttle.  The problem is then gone,
until the next strange occurance.
Please help.  It's now harder to diagnose, as it does not cpmpletely stop
and strand me, as it was doing before for 30 minute&quot;rest stops&quot; prior to
the coil and capacitor fixes.

P.S. I found h-4 headlights for the camper at the junkyard.  Be on the
lookout for 914's and similar sports cars with hidden headlights...you can
manually roll 'em open, often to find hidden treasures!  Happy hunting.
