I store &quot;my&quot; Bentley manual for the Vanagon at the local library.  They 
take such good care of it. ;-)

&gt; Anyway, I just spent $360 on the 84 vanagon for maintenance that I probably 
&gt; couldn't have done myself.  But, just the same, I'm kinda interested in a 
&gt; Bentley manual for the beast, but not to the tune of $85.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions on how a Bentley manual (for an 84 Vanagon) 
&gt; might be obtained for less than the dealer is asking?  I'll check the 
&gt; archives....
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance.

&gt; monster &amp; I'm not embarassed to drive it home anymore.  Hope your tranny 
&gt; works out ASAP)
