Subject:      87 Syncro Sell or Keep?

Okay I've been reading this list for a few months now and have experienced
all the known problems talked about on the Vanagon. Some have been fixed
some have not and some I've been told by my VW dealer never to bring it
back to them (Seems they could not fix it 2gs later).


Now the head gaskets has blown again (154k)  and I'm not sure if I want to
spend the $1200 (Plus heads if pitted) to get it fixed (not to mention the
heat blower and AC and a new clutch).


Dilemma:        *Sell the miserable beast (But I love it!) any takers?
                *Put it the path a Toronto
                (To hard to coordinate and possible jail time with
insurance fraud)
                *Reengine with Audi 5 cylinder ( I really like this one)



I really like the Reengine thing but I don't have the time to do it myself.
I got the know how (Thanks Zeidler Helmut) and some money. I'm looking for
someone in Minnesota (preferably the Twin Cities) that also wants to do a
reengine job.  I have a garage to do it in and most of the tools.  I think
a joint effort would go a lot faster.


Anyone interested?! Other wise, anyone want a good 87 syncro GL with all
the bells and a little seam rust with a few problems (Normal for a
Vanagon!)
