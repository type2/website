The 1500 T2 split from VIN #216000001 (August '65), used a 30 PICT-1. It 
had an automatic choke though!

They did use the 28 PICT and 28 PICT-1 up to 63 on the 1200, But both of 
these had an automatic choke. There is a 28 PIC with manual choke. If it 
is a 28, somethings not right. The holes for mounting a 28 &amp; 30 to the 
manifold are different. The manifold may have been changed also! 

For a 30 PICT-1 on a 1500 SP, the book says use a 117.5 main, a g60 idle, 
and a 135x air correction jet(s). I run this carb on my 1600 DP with a 
120 main, g55 pilot, and a 125 air correction. It gets 25 mpg pushing my 
61 split at 65.

Have fun.
