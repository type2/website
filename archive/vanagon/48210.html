Subject: '72 westy interior mods, parts

just before my big trip (see report) i did some cool interior mods.

i removed the backwards-facing seat entirely, and moved the sink/icebox 
unit to the left side, just behind the driver.  the door of the icebox 
opens to the left, i.e. the open box faces the sliding door.

in the process i replaced the floor with a new piece of plywood and put 
black and white tiled self-sticking floor tiles on it.  it looks really 
great and is easy to clean.

having the icebox and sink on the other side creates tons of space on 
the right, and it was a very simple thing to do.  the floor was 
surprisingly easy to cut.  has anyone else done this?

one thing i am looking for (besides an electric fridge for really 
cheap), is a small water pump for my sink.  of course the original one 
is kaput.  i cannot seem to find a suitable electric replacement.  the 
only ones i have found are huge and expensive.  any suggestions?

thanks for the ear(s)
