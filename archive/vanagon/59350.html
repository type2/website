Subject: Redux: My Own Private FAQ

As many of you know, I recently sold my 1986 Vanagon GL to purchase a 1988
 Wolfsburg Edition Vanagon.  My wife wanted an automatic transmission.  Again,
as before, several questions leap to mind as I am motoring along:

 #1.  Why are they called power mirrors when they don't seem to work?

 #2.  Isn't there supposed to be a gray plastic cover over the hinges on the
rear facing seats?

 #3.  How did all the cupholders get broken?

 #4.  The &quot;ground effects&quot; kit will not allow the shaft on the Bilstein jack
to go in all the way - was this really designed by a German engineer?  Or do I
need a Special Editon jack?

 #5.  The VW repair shop I used to recommend has proved unworthy.  Can anyone
recommend a good shop in Seattle?
