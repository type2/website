 Hi,
	Andy says:

&gt; Ford Scorpio/Granada and Audi 200 Turbo wheels fit. I've tried BMW wheels, 
&gt; they're just a gnat's off. Porsche alloys don't fit either. I know you don't 
&gt; have Granadas over there but there must be an equivalent Ford model (Centaur 
&gt; or something??) with 5 stud, 110mm PCD wheels that would be a cheap 

 Hmm, Tom Haapanen just posted:
&gt; The VW 5-bolt wheels have a 100 mm bolt circle just like the VW 4-bolt

 To r.a.vw, so I guess I was wrong about the VR6 wheels fitting.

 Sorry,
        W.
