Subject: muffler bolts / 73 bus

...anyone know if i can replace the muffler studs on a 73 bus ? had a hell
of a time to get the nuts off, even with wd-40 soaks and the &quot;smoke wrench&quot;
technique. was going to put in brass nuts as some suggested, but the studs
look so bad themselves, mebbe those oughta go too ? but they seem to sit in
the muffler pretty tight, anyone know if they can be replaced  at all ???
plus, nobody here has metric brass nuts anyways...where do you folks get
those ???
