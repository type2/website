Subject: Brake Drum Removal, Alldata web site

I have an 83 Westy, and I need to replace the rear brake linings.  The 
factory service manual indicates that I need to remove the rear hub to gain 
access to the linings.  It shows the removal of the large nut that secures 
the hub to the spindle.  Does anyone know what the size of that metric nut 
is?  Does anyone know where I might find a socket large enough to remove 
it.

I recently came across a reference site for cars:


http://www.alldata_dot_com

they have a CD- ROM for  many models of vehicles.  I noticed that they have 
one for vanagons, and they indicate that they use the factory manual as 
well as other sources for reference.  What I found was interesting, was 
that they also provide all service bulletins and recall information.  There 
are a number of interesting bulletins that I found on their web site.
Has anyone on the list purchased this CD?  Is it any good.  For $24.95, I'm 
thinking that it might be worth the gamble.  If I buy a copy, I post my 
findings to the list.

Thanks
