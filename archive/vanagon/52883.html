Subject: BA 6 AUX FAN
Date: Mon, 9 Dec 1996 11:33:21 -0500 (EST)

Hi Folks: I've installed the BA6 Gas heater with great success. It works
very well (so well that a small chip in the window became a very large
crack on a sub-zero day). At
the moment, I have installed a (JC Whitney) in-line fan booster at the
gas heater/heater box junction instead of the proper aux. fan that came with
the BA6. The in-line fan works well but is somewhat noisy- plus it doesn't
provide the air-recirculation that the aux. fan does. I have managed to
obtain an aux fan from a wreckers. The fan was pulled from an 89. Since
the 89
was watercooled, the junction box from the heater boxes was not part of the
components sent. I need to fashion a junction box and more importantly
figure out where to install the fan.  A neighbour's down the street (an
82) has his installed behind the passenger's side rear shock absorber.
Bentley's shows the fan standing -beside- the heater. My question is where
is the best place (most common?) location for the aux fan. Any ideas would
be helpful.

Thanks - DC

PS Canadian Westies - air and watercooled came equipped with the BA6 as
standard equipment - a nice touch.
