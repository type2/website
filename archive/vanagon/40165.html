&gt;OK, I know there was a ton of information on trailors recently, but since 
&gt;I figured that I wouldn't be towing anything any time soon, I just 
&gt;deleted them, now, I am having to tow my new bus home this weekend, not 
&gt;from my bus, but from my dad's explorer...is there any important things 
&gt;we ought to know be fore towing a bus...I just wanted to make sure cause 
&gt;I know there were quite a few messages a week or so ago on the topic...I 
&gt;know, I should have just read them then, but...
&gt;Dallas...oh yeah, we have a tow bar we have borrowed from a friend.

Rent a tow dolly with working surge brakes.  The life you save may be your
own.
