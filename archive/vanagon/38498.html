Subject: Events in Phoenix this weekend (nonvw)

Someone was inquiring about VW events in Phoenix this upcoming  weekend...

Although no VW events are know I wish to point out that the Third Annual
Coors Light Phoenix 500 Air Races are being held at the old Williams Air
Force base located in Mesa, AZ. If interested locate the Superstion Freeway
(US 360/ 60) and proceed east to Power Road. Head South from the freeway.
Might be worth the time.  The event is supposedly very cool. VanBondo
unfortunately can't make it...
