Subject:       Re: Bucking '83 Vanagon 42-47mph


&gt; I have an '83 that hesitates and bucks between 35-50 mph. This occurs
&gt; especially around 42-47 mph. The van runs great above and below these speed
&gt; ranges.

Here's a key thing to find out... is that bucking rpm specific?  
meaning does it do it no matter what gear you are in but always at, 
say, 2500-2800 rpm?  If the bucking can be reproduced in any gear 
than i would suggest looking at your air flow meter.  search the 
archives for advice on cleaning these buggers.  keep us posted.
