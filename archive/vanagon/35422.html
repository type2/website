Subject: '68 pickup,clutch,what happened?

Wednesday I was backing out of the garage and when I put the clutch pedal 
in, it went in and the clutch did not disengage.  The clutch pedal stayed 
down and I was late for work, so I pushed it back in the garage and expected 
that I broke the cable.

Last night I got underneath to change the cable, and it is not broken.  The 
pedal actuates the cross shaft, but nothing else is happening.  I will drop 
the engine tomorrow to take a look.  What can I expect?  Pressure plate 
replacement?

TIA,
Dean &amp; Opie ('68 crewcab)
