&gt;Does anyone know *how long* the original power cord was/is? IS there
&gt;anythingspecial about it other than the fact that it is &quot;orig. equip?&quot; 


My '71 was about 10' - 12', never any use unless you parked on top of the 
utility pole. Made sitting the van on a campsite a real pain. They were good 
cords, probably carry 40 amps, all I ever had was a light bulb and a 1500 
watt heater. Get at least a 25' (10 amp) cord, it'll store away better than 
the OEM.
