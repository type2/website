Scott, Yes it is a regular hose in that it is male at the camper end and
female at the end you hitch up at the campground.  You should purchase a
good grade of hose made for potable water as some hoses although probably
not toxic, will impart a wierd taste to the water.  Ours is 25' and I have
never had to use a longer one.  Incidentally, it coils up just right and
slips under the closet in the &quot;way-back&quot; to the left of the matress.  They
are usually white and easy to find at any RV store, some hardware stores,
boat supply stores and if all else fails and you want to pay the long buck,
at a campground.  One word of caution which we learned the hard way.  Buy
yourself a pressure reducer.  Screw this into the end of the hose before
you put it on the fawcet.  Some campgrounds have very high water pressure
and it will blow the interior supply hoses apart in your camper or at the
very least, make them leak.  Just don't forget to undo it and take it with
you when you leave.

Happy Trails
