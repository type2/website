Subject: Re: Synthetic Oils

Did'nt mean to offend an engineer, was merely stating an opinion,(an
endangered species lately on this list), I was just saying that i have used
regular motor oil for years now and have had no &quot;0&quot; yes zero engine
problems, and most of my vehicles have over 150,000 miles on them, in fact i
sold my '81 Honda prelude last year and she had 228,000 milesw on her and I
still see her buzzing round town.  I did'nt say it was no good I just can't
see the point and never will, unless they do away with petroleum.

&gt;&gt; would you buy a cubic zirconia for $1000 or a diamond of equal

&gt;
&gt;This is hog wash!  There's no analogy here.  Who is to say what &quot;Genuine&quot; oil
&gt;is?  Who is to say that it's any better if you could define it.  Performance
&gt;is what matters with motor oil, not sentiment as in diamonds.
&gt;
&gt;If they discovered a 1000 cubic mile hunk of diamond tomarrow, and it's price
&gt;dropped to that of coal, would it still carry the sentiment value it has
&gt;today? 
&gt;
&gt;But with motor oil there's no sentiment value and thus no analogy.
&gt;
&gt;I've been using synthetic motor oil exclusively fo 10 years now and haven't
&gt;had a single leak in 5 vehicles and oil usage of 1/4 qt/5,000 miles in only
&gt;one.
