Subject: re:VW sightings

All,

Yet some more VW sightings:

Wildcats- Goldie Hawn Drives a late '70 bus
Slackers - I saw the last 30 minutes of the movie, and saw no less than three
busses, all baywindows. This movie was filmed here in and around Austin, and
it is actually quite representative of the amount of VW's busses and otherwise
that are here.

Cheers,

David
