I just went through that on my 82 Vanagon.  It seemed to me that the bolts
angle outward somewhat, so even though things may fit OK once they are in
place, it is almost impossible to get the bolts throught the holes on the
flanges.  I first considered seperating the two sides somewhere and 
reconnecting after I got the two parts over the bolts seperately.  My 
exhaust is so rusted that I didn't want to bother with that, though.  I 
ended up brute-forcing it.  Stretched it with C-clamps (the loooong ones)
AS I was instaling it.  With some cussing and cursing I got it in place 
at last.

Good luck,

Albrecht
