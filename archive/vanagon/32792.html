Subject: More CIS updates

Hi Volks,
    I just wanted to write and thank everyone that has  written me with
their ideas for my injection  problem.  Just to let everyone know, the next
morning, after I wrote my post and  I installed the fuel pressure
regulartor the Van began to run great!  It starts and stays running on the
first try. No more hesitation or skipping.  Powers back to 'normal'.  We'll
see how long it lasts.  In the very near future I plan on cleaning the fuel
injectors and replacing the rubber seals just to be safe.  I have checked
the cold start valve and its fine no leaks and it works like The Book says.
Thanks again to all.  Hopefully this will be the last you'll here of this
from me.

                        Keep on Busin' -Jim D
