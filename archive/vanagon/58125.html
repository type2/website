Subject: '86 Golf, '84 Transporter

Greetings all!

I have recently joined this group and would like to introduce myself.  I
own a 1986 Golf, automatic, white - body needs paint job and modest rust
touchup - the car looks good overall.  I am thinking of keeping it, but
the car has a problem that I wonder if anyone could comment on.  As far
as I know,theflywheelhas some worn or missing teeth, and the starter
schreeches upon keying the ignition. It doesn't screech everytime, but
can be quite annoying.  Also, when driving, the transmission slips on
occasion.  The motor is strong and all else is in good shape.  The car
has 160,000 on it.

Is this car worth keeping?  Do the repairs required to the flywheel, etc
look to be &quot;too expensive&quot; for the car considering its' conditions?

Any comments would be greatly appreciated!

Also, I know of a 1984 Transporter for sale - body is in great shape,
seats are intact, interior pretty clean.  The engine needs some work
with the &quot;oxygen sensor&quot; light.  Other than that, the van seems OK.  As
I recall, it has 100,000 on it.  The person selling the van is asking
$1500 - does this sound like a typical offering for this type of VW?

I am considering buying this VW as I always wanted a VW van and I am
wondering if this is the right one to get my feet wet.

Again, any comments would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you,

Donald Berube
