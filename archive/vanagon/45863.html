&gt;ANNOUNCEMENT: Passat mailing list

&gt;Be careful when using sarcasm and humor. Without face to face
&gt;communications your joke may be viewed as criticism.

&gt;Abbreviate when possible:
&gt;
&gt;Examples:
&gt;
&gt;  IMHO = in my humble/honest opinion
&gt;  FYI = for your information
&gt;  BTW = by the way
&gt;  Flame = antagonistic criticism
&gt;  :-) = happy face for humor

Other useful Passat abbreviations:

WH2W = we had to walk
RN = recall notice
PT = public transportation
R:( = exasperated rant
BZT = electrical problems
