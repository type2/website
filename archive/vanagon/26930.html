&lt;another snip&gt;
&gt;On the trip down there, on Hwy 80, going about 70 in the middle lane,
&gt;several people would zoom up from behind in the #1 lane, slide over 2 lanes, 
&gt;pass me, and then zoom back to the #1 lane. C'mon - be a MAN - pass on the
LEFT!

Rusty just had to pipe up and spew:
For this reason I can hardly wait to take the '67 Westy &quot;blindspot-mobile&quot;
out on the roadways of America. As we all know, the Westys of this general
vintage have a coat closet in the rear passanger quarter of the bus. It
makes for a terrific blindspot. The Westy is gunna be the wife's daily
driver. The wife is a true sweetheart but has *contacts* as thick as Coke
bottles. The combo of the happy-go-lucky Phoenix motoring public, the half
blind wife, and the Westy blindspot, and the bazillion dollar 13 month paint
and bodywork is going to be real interesting! Happy, happy joy-joy! We'll do
the best we can, have fun with it and insure the p*ss out of it.
BTW: the &quot;Too Slow? Too Bad!&quot; bumper sticker works great on the single cab!
As to the &quot;C'mon - be a MAN&quot; is concerned, I find that the &quot;man&quot; is usually
a 18-25 year old blonde in a red &quot;cat box&quot; sports car or Mr. Sexually
frustrated Businessman in a mid 80's Ford LTD 4 door with a NRA and Family
oriented bumper and Counry music FM station related stickers and a fish
attatched on the back.&quot; Strangely enough, I get lots of glares and fingers
from both groups.
