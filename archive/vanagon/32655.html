Subject: Re: Swimmin' with the Fiches

The killer fiche set to get is the *BOSCH* set--parts and repair. Has much
more detail than the VW set on the engine management stuff. Bosch dealers
are much more resistant than even VW dealers to giving out their fiches for
Vanagon, however.

&gt;I bought the VW/Audi microfiche today (well, I'll get them Monday).  I'm 
&gt;*sooo* excited.  The set sounds very complete from the description over 
&gt;the phone (the stack is about 5 inches tall).  The parts manager rattled 
&gt;off the models and years covered and it sounded good to me.  He was firm 
&gt;on his price, so I agreed to the $100 value.  Joel may this think this 
&gt;foolish, but this is not the first time I have been a fool for VW stuff.  
&gt;I want to keep a full set of VW fiche, but it sounds like this may have 
&gt;two sets (or a lot of duplicates).  Not sure what I'm going to do next (I 
&gt;want to get them first, sort them, and see what I have), but I'll keep 
&gt;the list posted on the availability of any extras.  The set was 
&gt;refreshed in 1991 or 1992 and saw very little use since (they dropped 
&gt;the VW line in early 1993), so they should be in good shape.  Now I need to 
&gt;get access to a scanner and CD-R equipment (for personal archival purposes 
&gt;only, of course). ;-)
