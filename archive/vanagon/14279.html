&gt; &gt; &gt; How about Yosemite in Spring. They'll be lots of water, spectacular water 
&gt; &gt; &gt; falls, cool days, cooler nights, and HOT SHOWERS, Martha. (At Curry 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Village for $1, nice, clean, white tile.)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; How tough would it be to get reservations?
&gt; 
&gt; Impossible.  You have to reserve a year in advance for Yosemite, except
&gt; for the high country which cannot be reserved at all.

  That's true for the Awanhee &lt;sp?&gt; but not so for the campgrounds. They
  will take reservations only  6 or 8 weeks in advance and it is through
  Mistix &lt;aka Mistakes&gt;. A guy here at work just got reservations for Mother's
  Day in the Upper Pines campground &lt;in the valley, near Curry Village&gt; and 
  was trying to talk me into going.

  It may be that if we move fast on reservations we could get enough sites
  for mid-May.
