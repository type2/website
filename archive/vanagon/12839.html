Patrick,

If this is the retro fit unit to eliminate esd interference with the air flow 
sensor, then yes, it does work.  What we discovered, in addition to this was 
that you need to be very careful about replacement of your distributor harness 
(plug/coil wires).  We discovered that the Bosch replacement wires available 
through the local import auto store had the wrong resistance for the 
electronics in our '90 Syncro Westie.  How it was characterized was by the 
Syncro pouring raw fuel into the airbox which caused it to foul the plugs and 
run on only 2 or 3 cylinders.  At idle (no load), it would run on all four 
cylinders, but once you loaded the motor, it ran completely fat.  The only way 
the dealer figured it out was to swap out the harness with a '90 camper on the 
used lot and the problems went away.  We ordered the VW OEM harness for the 
Syncro and have had NO problems since then...  Hope this helps...

        Jon


I am having weird problems with a 2.1
 The unexplained cutting out,etc...(eps. after a long drive)

I was thinking of getting that updated wiring harness for the
 air flow box. part number 025 906 302

Does any one have experience with this part...
 I saw the article in the FAQ, but i wanted to see if any one had 
personal experience with this upgrade...

Thanks
patrick
