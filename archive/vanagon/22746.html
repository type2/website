&gt; i equate this to the 'perfect' shim material as discussed in
&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance... anyone know what that
&gt;material was?
&gt;
&gt;-dan

==========================

Beer cans of course. Soft, uniform in thickness--- perfect.


And in the &quot;Ode to Billy Jo&quot; movie, it was a childs rag doll that was
thrown from the bridge.  I don't believe it was ever revealed what it was
in the song that inspired the film.

Yours in Quality,

Peter.
