Subject: Re: Wanted  !

1. For my friend who has an 89 Westi, he needs a electric motor for the 
   driver side window. 
2. For me, the lense for the light to the left of the stove in an 85 
   Westi GL (the fixture is okay, just missing the lense cover).
3. When I bought my 85, it came with the &quot;3rd bucket seat&quot;. Never have
   used it, don't have plans to, did'nt know it was a rare thing, and
   if anyone is interested, I would sell it. Can anyone tell me a fair
   value for such a thing?

Kit Carter, 85 Westi GL (VanGo)
