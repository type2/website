Subject: RE: Auto Techs: the Next Generation


&gt;During the recent thread on Quality -or- They Don't Make 'Em Like
&gt;They Used To, reference has been made as to the difficulty, if not
&gt;impossibility of repair on modern fuel, computer, or electrical systems.

In my case, I was referring to the difficulty of _diagnosis_. Once I knew
what was wrong, the repair was like changing a light bulb. Almost. Except,
when the Toyota dealership replaced the fuel injectors, they over-torqued
the fuel connections to three of them. Instant gasoline shower in the
engine compartment from one injector, which fortunately did not catch fire.
Two more let go after the warranty expired (6 mo).


&gt;Those systems can and are being repaired.  However, they are being
&gt;diagnosed and repaired by well-trained technicians that have a good
&gt;understanding of the fundamentals of engine systems in addition to
&gt;system specific training.

Yup. And those well-trained techs at the Toyota dealer, knew (or at
least claimed) that there was NO way to diagnose the fuel injectors
on my '80 Cressida, except by pulling them and bench-testing them.
At their labor rates (which I have no quarrel with, BTW), this would
cost more than simply replacing them. So they did, and the car ran much
better, and I lived happily ever after (and $2000 poorer including
U-joints). Until the ignition went.

My point: If you get 10 years or so out of a new car, even a well-built
one like a Toyota, better dump it, 'cause it will bite you soon. Hard.
