&gt;  There's a final related issue I'd like to hear others address.  I find 
&gt; the Vanagon Westie to be the peak of some kind of hard to describe camper 
&gt; continuum.  I know of no better vehicle available, FOR ANY PRICE, suited 

I have, as a matter of fact, been trying to locate a competitor to 
the Westi for a few years, just to see what I can find.
Here's my undocumented, yet demented report:
Here's the criteria:

Good ground clearance for off road use.
Sleeping and seatbelts for 4 or more (I have 3 kids &amp; a spouse).
Decent power and handling, 4WD a bonus.
Low height for off road/under tree clearance.
Reasonabe cost.

Here are the results of 3 years of looking:

I found a 4WD Dodge small truck based camper that has adequate 
sleeping/belts, 4WD, lotsa power, tall fulltime (no-poptop)
$48,000 yikes

A Dodge or Chevy full size van conversion done in Canada marketed in 
US (at least in WA state).  Lotsa power, standing room where it's 
needed (kitchen only), various floor plans for sleeping for 2 - 4 plus.  
Same ground clearance as std van (read ok but not great).
Non-pop top, but only about 6 inches higher than std van.
Around $40,000, yikes again,  a very nice conversion built for camping 
not a party van as are most US conversions. Includes toilet &amp; shower!

Anybody else out there find anything else?
Reinforced that the Westi is as good as it gets, for far less.
If a big wad of $ dropped on me, I would find a Synchrowesti (dream)
or just keep my '80 running (reality)

- Jeff '80 Westi  

I Know of an outfit, Sportsmobile, that does custom van conversions.  Will do
Dodge, Chevy or ford.  Don't know about VW's ?  Anyways these are becoming
more popular with the windsurfing/Surfing community on the west coast.
 Particuarily several that venture down into Baja.  And I mean way down, like
on the order of 20+ hours down.  These are nasty looking and performing
machines.  Big block turbo diesels,4WD, modified Heavy duty suspensions, Full
camper layouts with microwaves, TV/VCR's, External showers, extra fuel tanks
and winches. These are serious off road machines. But the price is serious as
well, $50,000+  If anyone want more info I may be able to get more from the
company that does the conversions or some friends that have them in Cal. 
Getting a little side tracked but this might be interesting to some,  Have
good friends who previously owned an 88 Westy.  They made frequent trips into
Baja.  Like I said earlier way down.  Never really had a problem keeping up
with the big boys.  If they got stuck in the sand they would have someone
with a winch pull them out.  They said the key was to keep the speed up so
you would not feel the wash board dirt road.  Basically they beat the living
SHIT out of their van, but had few problems.  Now they own a Eurovan.
 Although they like the Euro they said it the ground clearance is too low to
go deep into Baja.
