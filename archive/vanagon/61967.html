Subject: Should Steve Buy a Syncro? 

Steve, I just read your letter.Judging by the thoughtful questions that
yu asked, I would advise you to enter this realm with much prayer and
fasting. Vanagons are truly the greatest vehicular gift that God has
bestowed upon us, however it could be argued that he intended them only
for a chosen and crazy few. Just like any other great faith Vanagonism
is embraced by few and understood by fewer. Yes, it is true that many
try for a short time but the fact is, few are true believers. Why is
this so? Oh no, it is not because of the dreaded white cloud that most
of the true faithful know, nor is it because of the various maladies
described on the holy list. Steve, it is because of love. True love
lasts and endures beyond wonky speedos and kaput 3-4 sync rings. Are you
capable of this kind of love Steve? Or are you just another Toyota
lover? Only you can answer the question Steve.


Wishing you a great journey
John Rudolph
