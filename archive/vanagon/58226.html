Subject: RE: Handling Improvements 

Word of caution - -  With a high CG vehicle, like a Vanagon, you can actually improve handling 
too much.  If the tires provide too much lateral stiffness, you can run the risk of rolling your 
bus.  Some SUV manufacturers put laterally soft tires on their trucks for this reason.

If your bus originally came with 185R14 tires and you want to keep the same tire outside 
diameter, I suggest the following tire sizes:

	P185/75R15    185/75?R15    ?=S, T, H or V speed rating
	P195/70R15    195/70?R15
	P205/70R15    205/70?R15  &lt;- Probably the best option
	P205/65R15    205/65?R15
	P215/65R16    215/65?R15

You will have to check the load capacity of the above tires to make sure that they are suitable. 
 You may have to use reinforced tires for the 185 and 195 sizes.

Watch suspension and fender clearances.

Another way to improve handling is to use high durameter (stiff) suspension bushings.

These changes will provide a harsher ride.

&gt;I have an 87 &quot;westie&quot; that is in dire need of tires, wheels, and a new
&gt;suspension.  Here is what I would like to do with it.....
&gt;
&gt;1)Replace trashed steel wheels with 15&quot; alloys.
&gt;2)Use lower profile 60 or 70 series tires.
&gt;3)New shocks (or is it struts??) all around and potentially stiffer
&gt;springs.  I would like to lower the front end slightly from its stock
&gt;configuration.
&gt;4)Potentially add anti sway bars.
&gt;
&gt;Questions for you fellow VW fanatics...
&gt;1)Does anyone have any comments, ideas, experience with any of the
&gt;above???
&gt;2)Does anyone know where I can find performance parts to do a job like
&gt;this???
&gt;3)I am concerned about finding suitable tires if I go to 15&quot; wheels.
&gt;I have met several people that have done this to there vans and they
&gt;said that handling improved significantly even without the heavy duty
&gt;Mich 205/70 R14's.
&gt;4)Also looking for the stock wolfsburg front air dam and side skirts to
&gt;round out the upgrade.  Anyone know where to look for them???  Since my
&gt;bumpers are trashed I would like to get the molded covers that go along
&gt;with all this too....
&gt;5)Do the KYB shocks that I have seen advertised for the Vanagon allow 
&gt;the ride to be adjusted??  I want to be able to around corners in a 
&gt;decent fasion.
&gt;
&gt;I know I have alot of questions here....but hopefully you can help me
&gt;out.
&gt;
&gt;I greatly appreciate any help!
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Chet
