Subject: RE: ADVICE/Info Needed!

&gt;    I am wondering what my options are as to replacing the original engine
&gt; in a ('50-'79) bus with a water-cooled engine so I can have some *real*
&gt; heat...what specific engines will work? And how must the heating system be
&gt; modified? Any information on this type of modification would be greatly
&gt; appreciated! 

Gees!  If anyone has noticed I just got my mails mixed up and sent a really
obscure message to the vanagon list....I apologise!

My brother-in-law runs a 13B bridge ported rotary in his 75 bus. Goes like
stink and scares the tripe out of me..... The conversion is not that hard -
engine mount, adaptor plate fabrication  and (VW) flywheel modification are
really all there is to it.  Arranging the cooling involved running two pipes
the length of the bus (underneath) to a radiator and some universal water
hose. The radiator mounted on the front looks a bit ugly IMHO.  Anyway, once
this sort of setup is in place is is easy to 't-piece' into the line install
hot water heaters.  We got it all done in a weekend and I can give more
details to anyone who is interested.......

I wouldn't do this one myself but it is an 'easy' conversion for those
looking for this type of thing.  Rotaries also guzzle gas of course (probably
less problem with the 'low' gas prices in the States..).  This beastie runs
on LP Gas.
