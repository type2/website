Subject:      DS Headlights no work

On my 89 Syncro Westi, on high beam, both the Driverside lights do not work.
I recently replaced both side hi/lo bulbs and all the bulbs are still good. I
have looked at 2 different FAQ's but found nothing.
Is there a relay, and where is it?
Where do the earth wires connect to ground?
Could it be the light switch or hi/lo switch?
What else could it be? what else should I check?
Thank you ...........JoE
