     berry,
     
     &gt;Anyway, my wife and I have a '84 Vanagon GL and an '86 Jetta GL.  
     &gt;(And a Triumph TR6 and a '51 Mk VI Bentley, but I don't think you 
     &gt;folks are that interested in Britcars).
     
     don't be too sure, some of us drive non vw's as well.
     
     Lee.
     
     '64 samba
