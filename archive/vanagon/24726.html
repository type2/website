&gt;Does anyone want to suggest how much money to save ahead for food?  I
&gt;realize that this might seem obvious (just figure out what you spend
&gt;now), but eating in the camper on the road can cost quite a bit
&gt;different than eating at home.


Depends on how many rabbits and ducks you encounter on the way, and
how good a shot you are with your .22-- or how fast you can run!  :)
