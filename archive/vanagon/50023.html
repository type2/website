hi kevin,

thanks so much for your note. as far as the ev camper-what can i say. 
Definitely can't afford a new one. do you even know how much they go for 
new? so used would be '93 thru i guess '96. i'm thinking at least $20,000 
maybe $25,000. low mileage and any color besides red. i really just 
started looking last weekend and couldn't even find one to look at. 
estimated buying time would be dec-april'9

i'm also curious to know if ev camper owners like 'em...

thanx,
kerri holland

&gt;Kerri,
&gt;Not sure if I can help on this one but here goes...
&gt;For some reason there is a large population of EV's here in Colorado 
&gt;(realtively large, they are quite rare).. Both on dealer lots and on 
&gt;the road. 
&gt;Anyway, if you are interested in expanding your search perhaps I 
&gt;could be of assistance.
