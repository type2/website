Subject: Manual Pages Needed: Coolant Change



Can anyone fax me a copy of the manual pages for 
changing/flushing/bleeding coolant, etc.? My fax no. is 415-364-5945 for 
1985 vanagon Westphalia. Any tip sheets also appreciated.

I've got a temp light on, temp. gauge toping out, no hot air when I turn 
on the heater.

We initially put in some Prestone coolant/water mixture but I just 
noticed some older messages suggesting use only of VW's coolant, and 
maybe 100%, no water.... true?

My VW started blowing some serious smoke or vapor, very thick out last 
night, and on checking, we found the refill and expansion tanks were both 
empty. This was a surprise because sometime ago my temp light and gauge 
began toping up as if to show overheating, but then spontaneously came 
back to normal.... then top up again,..... then normal. An earlier check 
of coolant made it look ok.

So from these items, I'm guessing that perhaps the problem could be air 
in the system?

TIA
