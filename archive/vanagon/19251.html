Subject: That cig lighter socket in the wheel well

I had a talk with my friend Kevin who has one of these sockets ('85
Weekender), and the mystery was solved. The transcript follows, in a
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern style dialog:

Dave: You know, I've been reading on the Vanagon list about this socket, and
how no one seems to know what it's for.   
Kevin: Really? That's for the refrigerator.
Dave: But you don't have a refrigerator.
Kevin: I know.
Dave: But you don't have a Wesfalia. You don't have a cabinet for a
refrigerator.
Kevin: That's right.
Dave: So this socket's for something else.
Kevin: No, it's for the refrigerator.
Dave: OK, I'll bite.  What refrigerator?
Kevin: The one that used to be there.
Dave: Can I have some of what you're drinking (smoking? Ingesting?)
Kevin: There was a refrigerator behind the passenger seat, and it plugged
into the socket. That's how it ran.
Dave: I've never seen yours.
Kevin: I don't have one.
Dave: Huh? I mean, what?
Kevin: It disappeared before I ever bought the van.
Dave: How do you know all this?
Kevin: It's in the manual. I still  _have_  that.
(Dave rummages around for about a year in the voluminous glove compartment,
pulls out the &quot;camper&quot; (weekender) manual for 1985. Sure enough, it's all
there. Gee, it actually pays to read the manual, barring the Westy pictures
mistakenly interspersed with the Weekender illustrations.)
Dave: Oh. So, why not wire it in permanently? Why have a socket?
Kevin: For convenience. So you can remove it for extra space.
Dave: Oh.
Kevin: Hence, mine's gone.
Dave: Oh.
(There's a moment of silence in memorial of missing camper equipment like
refrigerators and swivel tables, curtains and window screens)
