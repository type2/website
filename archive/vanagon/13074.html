&gt; also, my rear hatch latch is broken...does anyone one know how do get the
&gt; lock mechanism out?  the hatch is closed and locked. bummer huh. i tried
&gt; to take out the mechanism from the inside, but i doesn't come out.
&gt; 
If you remove the interior panel on the rear hatch, you can access the
locking mechanism. With a sturdy screwdriver, you should be able to push
the lock lever and open the hatch from the inside. Once it is open, you
can remove the lock itself. I had to do this on my '67.
