Subject:      vanagon/bus trailer hitch

for vanagon folks, in the newsletter of the VWCOA, the Autoist, there was
an article (don't see a date on it) about some folks who made a 10,581 mile
trip in an 83 vanagon ... pulling a little travel trailer. they got their
hitch from
   Rigid Hitch in Bloomingtom, Minn. (max gross: 1000 lbs; max tongue weight:
100 lbs). it bolts to the towing loops on the back of the bus. $115 including
installation and electrical connections. &lt;note: i'm sure this was printed
at least eight years ago!&gt;.

anybody in bloomington/st. paul area want to see if they can track down these
folks (rigid hitch)?

for the bus folks:
when i had a 1971 bus, i was able to buy a trailer hitch from the (then) local
dealer. it bolted to some threaded holes in the outside of the frame members
(the big ones that are just outside the engine compartment). it was a self-
installed kit (just bolt it together and onto the bus). it was made of L-angle
iron.

so before you get too depressed about the prices of u-haul and such, take a
look under your buses rear end, and see if you have those threaded bolt holes
(in the vertical frame members) ... you might be able to get someone to make
your hitch for you. most welding shops that i've dealt with were incredibly
cheap (or so it seemed, to a non-welder!). :)

for everyone:
when i had my 1980 vanagon, i wanted a trailer and a trailer hitch. i had seen
an advertisement in german magazine ... by westfalia, no less ... and wrote
for more info. the westfalia people were very nice and the trailer hitch was
$135, while the trailer was $700 (little thing, about 5 feet long and 4 feet
side. with torsion bar suspension). their letter said they could put it on a
vw transport boat and have it delivered to your local vw dealer. pre-paid, of
course. :)

i don't know if they still would do that, but it was a nice little fantasy
for a while. i never did follow through ... :(  but it's a thought. anybody
that wants it, i have the address for westfalia.

p.s. the westfalia hitch/trailer use the german hitch system, NOT the u.s.
ball and cup system. theirs is more like the military trailer system.
