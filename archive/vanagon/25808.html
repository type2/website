Subject: Westies w/ ATs

     While looking through the classifieds in the San Francisco Chronical, I 
     noticed that out of 7 Westfalias for sale from '71 through '85 all but 2 of 
     them had ATs.  Is it because they were so popular that there are a large 
     number on the market due to sheer volume or are they less desirable, due to 
     one reason or another, and therefore their owners are trying to unload them 
     to a very small market and thus linger in the classifieds?
     
     I've always preferred a stick vs. an AT in all of my cars with the 
     exception of the Volvo wagon which is automatic and is a great machine.  
     Should I avoid the AT version of the VW bus/vanagon?  or are they an 
     acceptable alternative to the 4sp?
