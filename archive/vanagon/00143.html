I think this may be wrong about all Type IIs are made in Hanover. I think the
Syncro models were assembled in Austria by Styer-Daimler-Punch (spelling
wrong?).

The story goes that SDP wouldn't agree to build the 4x4 stuff for the Type II
for VW unless VW agreed to let SDP assemble the vehicle. VW caved in. SDP
then subcontracted the viscous coupling design out fo Porsche.
