Subject: RE: a  really cool VW

These were very common when I was in Germany in 71-73, but I've never seen one
in the US.  Somewhat similar to Grumman postal vans in US now, but smaller.
The other vehicle I coveted that never came to the US was the 4-speed 412
station wagon.  In my eyes a contender for prettiest VW ever, but only the
automatics came to the US.  THAT would be a great Porsche six conversion.
