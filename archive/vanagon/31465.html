Regarding seting up the Digifant,  The Digifant will compensate.  The
response may not be that great during warm-up, but once the system goes
closed loop, (O2 sensor kick in). Everything will be fine.  I am very
interested in obtaining the parts for this Mod.  I have no problem performing
the mechanics and I can find any machine work needed.

Please keep me posted.  I am available for any R+D help.
Thanks, Dennis.
