Subject: Re: Driving Lights?

The Canadian version of daytime driving lights for 88-91's uses a normally closed relay to turn 
off the low beam elements when you turn the brights on. It is wired with one side of the relay 
coil to ground and the other side to the high beam indicator lamp circuit. The relay contacts  
are connected to the low beam headlights on the fuse block terminal &quot;M2&quot; and to the 12V supply 
where it comes in to the headlight switch. 
VW of Canada confirmed that the only purpose of the daytime driving light relay is to keep from 
having the low and high beams on at the same time.
I have wired my 91 up (temporarily) this way and it does work as advertised.

&gt;Hella makes some half-driving/half-fog lights that might fit the bill. but
&gt;the problem is that mounting them down on the bumper (the only place to do
&gt;it) makes them less effective, in terms of other people seeing you. the
&gt;safest (easiest?) thing would be to come up with the headlight fixtures from
&gt;Canada for the same year ... they have the Daytime Running Lights bulb
&gt;fixtures already made into the headlight reflectors.
