&gt;...         What do you do with flushed brake fluid for instance?

for all sorts of fluids that accumulate around a Household Garage and
Fixit Shop, check with the local Jiffy Lube and places like Pep Boys or
Carport or AutoZone ... the local guys around here have been really great
about taking the old oil, brake fluid, coolant, anything that comes out of
a car ... if one guy turns you away, keep checking. as i understand it,
the Jiffy Lube folks get paid for the gallons of oil that they recycle so
they don't mind a little extra. as for the coolant and brake fluid, the
guy here said just dump it in with the oil. ??

and, er, uh ... i would NOT advise buying recycled motor oil for your car. ;)
