&gt; Several list members inquired if we can receive the same format for the

&gt; messages.
&gt;
&gt; So far I haven't seen any response to anyone's postings that inquired about
&gt; this.  Is this possible to accomplish?  It would be soooo nice to have this
&gt; feature again.

We (Ron &amp; I) could not find this function in the LISTSERV software
documentation, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Ron has contacted
our rep at LSOFT to see if the digest numbering option is available, and
if not, if it can be written into the program. Although, the later won't
help us much because we purchased an unlimited license for the current
version ... no updates, etc. (this kind of license sells for $2K/yr, big
ouch!). Maybe we can get a beta version ?

We'll let everyone know as soon as we hear something.
