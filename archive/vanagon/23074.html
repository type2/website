Subject: Re: factory rebuilt vanagon trans FS

&gt; For sale : Factory Rebuilt Vanagon Transmission. three months old,
&gt;            Three thousand miles of use. This is a late style box, 86
&gt;            and up ( trans code ACW ) The owner of this can not afford
&gt;            to continue with his rebuild of a vanagon. The transmission
&gt;            is now in an 87' vanagon, which will also be stripped soon
&gt;            after the trans is sold. The Van is in Baltimore Md.
&gt;            Shipping is possible.
Patrick,
Hi, I have an 87 Vanagon with a sick AT. I am considering converting it to a
manual. Do you have all the shift linkage, pedals, clutch slave cylinder and
flywheel too? If yes, we might work something out!
