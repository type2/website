&gt;Diagnosis of Water Pump:
&gt;
&gt;	I have no signs that the water pump needs replacement.  The system IS
&gt;	cooling, just not at peak efficiency. If the water pump is
&gt;	out/flakey, then I'd think I'd have SIGNIFICANT cooling
&gt;	problems.
&gt;
&gt;	Diagnosis: I don't really need a water pump at this time,
&gt;	although it might be a good precautionary move.
&gt;
Steve,

this may not really help, but when the water pump went out on my
78 Scirocco (btw, it was the original pump!), it just made a funny
noise.  There were no cooling problems.
