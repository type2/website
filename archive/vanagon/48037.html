Subject: Stumped

   Do you know anyone who sell's cruise controls for a 73 bus with a 1700
engine, will this screw up my vacume?  Also do you know any who sell a front
end bra for a 73 bus that has the spare tire on the front?
   I can not find anyone who might have these parts.  Any info would be
greatly appreciated.

                            Thanks
