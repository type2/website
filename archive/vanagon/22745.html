&gt; 
&gt; Does anybody have any leads on the Goodyear g60 tires that are original 
&gt; equipment on Eurovans?
&gt; 
&gt; I need to find four with in about the next month.
&gt; 
&gt; The tire man I deal with (typically pretty good) has yet to gome up with 
&gt; a source. Everything he hears is the tires are on backorder etc.

I went to NTW in Houston.  They found me a set but they said there were
only 3 pairs in all of the Houston area.  They are also expensive tires.
Did you try a VW dealer?
