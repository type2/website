Subject: Re:useless subject headings

Hello,

 Im the sender of that useless heading about fuel pumps. I just 
thought Id say Im sorry, but I didnt have time to proof read. Dont 
you have anything better to do than sit around and bitch about 
subject headings? We all make mistakes, especially when in a hurry. 
My useless heading seemed to work I got the help I needed anyway. So 
heres another subject to cluter up your precious E-mail space.

p.s. If the year is in my letter why repeat it?
