&gt;I hope that subject makes some sense.  I started my bus last night for
&gt;the first time in 12 days.  It has been about 0 F for about two weeks 
&gt;now.  I got to thinking:  when I started my engine new I was advised to
&gt;crank it over without the coil connected until the oil light went out.
&gt;Is something similar advisable for an engine that has sat for 12 days?
&gt;Does it do any good at all or is the oil still in the places I would 
&gt;try to get it to?  Thanks, Jim

Engine sitting for 12 days is not an issue.  Although some say to turn dry
engine over with coil disconected, I disagree.  The oil pump will take along
time to build pressure at this low speed and the cylinders get no lubrication
at all until the crank turns fast enough to throw the oil.  Modern oils have
additves that protect the engine during idle periods.  Parts do remain coated
for long periods of time.  Otherwise, engine would start rusting immediately,
 especially in any type of humid weather, warm or cold.
