Subject: RE: I shift; bus don't go...

&gt;&gt;Coming home for lunch today, I turned off the major street onto my own,
&gt;&gt;downshifted and released the clutch petal, only to hear a little clicking
&gt;&gt;and feel a little coasting. Rev, Rev, Coast, Coast.
&gt;&gt;
Steve suggested:

&gt;Tranny parts are indeed a possible suspect... but if I were you, I'd start
&gt;by checking the CV joints (for '68 and later) and clutch first.

Also consider a weird one that happened to me. One of my 69's rear brake
drum splines just plain wore out. The stub axel splines were fine, but the
matching ones in the drum wore/rusted to paper thinness and then sheared
off one day when I tried to pull away from the curb. Just a slight
tick-clicking (not the clacking I've heard from CV's) was present. This
problem is possibly the least expensive of your suspects. Good luck!

Regards, Jim
