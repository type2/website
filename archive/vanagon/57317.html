Subject: Re: Alloy Wheels



Does anyone have direct experience with Borbet wheels (or any other 3rd
party, for that matter) being an inferior product? Also, I'm a bit confused
as to why the lug nuts one would purchase with a set of wheels would not
properly fit those wheels?

&gt;You should really check out those&quot; look alike&quot; &quot;MERCEDES WHEELS&quot; prior to
&gt;selling them or buying them as you are attempting to do, They are not as
&gt;solid, nor as sturdy, nor do they resemble the FACTORY VW ALLOY WHEEL
&gt;BUILT FOR THE VANS,the lug nuts are not safely mountable as they do not fit
&gt;the concave of the rim, and if you do still attempt to use these wheels
&gt;on your vans, make sure you get a lug wrench or tool that will fit the nut
&gt;on the wheel in the event  you have to change a wheel, also when you
&gt;have 15&quot;tires mounted on 15&quot;wheels you need to consider the shortening
&gt;of the turning radius and the bottoming out onto the larger tire and
&gt;wheel,because unless you raise the front and rear you have certainly
&gt;lost circumference room and risk citting into the tire causing a
&gt;blowout,I speak from experience and of course this is OMHO,
