Subject: Re: Bus Art: paint ideas and designs?

i have an orange 75 deluxe camper i plan on painting soon
i dont want to change the color totally because that would mean ttaking
everything off the bus to paint it
i though of staying mostly orange or something that would match the orange
interior paint
i haven't decided yet but i think i am going to go with yellow front end with
flames into orange rear (top included)
