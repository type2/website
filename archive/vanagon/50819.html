Subject: Re: Primary Battery Removal:  How to?

&gt; I need to replace my primary battery underneath the passenger seat in my '87
&gt; Westy.
&gt; 
&gt; Trouble is, I can't get my hands or even a finger down inside the battery
&gt; compartment to get it out.  The battery just barely sits inside the comparment.
&gt; There is no handle on the battery, and nothing to grab on top but the posts.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone reccommend a neat trick to get the bugger out of there?  How about a
&gt; trick to make sure that it will be easy to get it out in a few years should I
&gt; need to replace it again?
&gt; 
They used to make vinyl or rubber straps with metal eyes on each end 
to slip over the posts, designed for carrying batteries. Haven't seen 
them for a while, so I'm not sure if they still exist.
