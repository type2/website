From: Richard &lt;rapalmer_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu&gt;

&gt;      Well, as of Tuesday lunchtime, I have definate positive responses from
&gt; the following:

&gt;   Scott Hoover - Somewhere in NC
&gt;   Pete Sellers (possibly)
&gt;   David Easterwood - Atlanta
&gt;   Stefan Ufer - Chapel Hill NC
&gt;   Victor (gt4281b_at_prism.gatech_dot_edu) Atlanta
&gt;   Frank Terhaar - somewhere in NC
    Steven Dolan - Washington DC
    Donald Baxter - Atlanta
    Sami Dakhlia (possibly) - Missouri
&gt; 
&gt; Others have expressed past interest, so if you do not see your name
&gt; here, please do respond soon. Also, at least one communal meal has been
&gt; suggested. Perhaps some suggestions for that? Perhaps two, a breakfast
&gt; and a dinner? Also, when are folks planning to arrive?(stressing that
&gt; gates do close at 6pm) Also , some regional caravaning has been
&gt; suggested.
&gt;   So, I vote to make this a definate plan, and thusly begin planning!
&gt; What fun, I can hardly contain myself! 
&gt;  (all past details are below...)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Ok, I have seen so far a few people interested. George Washington's
&gt; &gt; Birthday weekend seems to be the time of choice. This is Friday Feb. 17
&gt; &gt; through possibly Monday, Feb. 20. Those interested would I suppose meet
&gt; &gt; Friday afternoon/evening, and others join when possible. Sorry to bother
&gt; &gt; those who have already replied yes, but please, let's get a sort of
&gt; &gt; final count and idea of times people could arrive. ( I will probably get
&gt; &gt; there Friday early afternoon, and remember, the gate closes at 6) Also,
&gt; &gt; should we dare to try a communal eating set-up?any ideas/volunteers for
&gt; &gt; that? Anyone bringing kids/dogs/guitars/anything else?  I am not much of
&gt; &gt; an organizer, so I'm sure I'm forgetting a lot. Please do respond, even
&gt; &gt; if you have already. Thank you all and have a lovely day. I have included
&gt; &gt; below all the information about the location, the Jordan Lake State Park.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   So, there is ONE park open now, it is the Jordan Lake State Park. It
&gt; &gt; &gt; is on highway 64, around Apex, N.C. which is actually closer to D.C, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; around the same from the South.
&gt; &gt; &gt;   They have 100 spaces available now, 6 people per space (as many
&gt; &gt; &gt; vehicles as you can fit! ) and it's $9.00 for a regular space, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; $14.00 for a space with a power hook-up (this is per space, not per
&gt; &gt; &gt; person) The park gates are open 8 am - 6 pm, and the number for all
&gt; &gt; &gt; wishing further details is 1-919-362-0586. This is the park office, open
&gt; &gt; &gt; 9-5. As Isaid, this is on a lake, with trails to hike, etc. I have talked
&gt; &gt; &gt; to several people that have been there, and they all said it was nice.
