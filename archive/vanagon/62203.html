I want to redo the plastic / hoses and anything else that could be a
problem. from the tank to the engine. does anyone know how much hose is
needed, and what sizes ? Some of the hoses were recently replaced by VW
under recall, so I'll deduct what I don't need when I check it out closer
this weekend. I hear that you can use SAE fuel hose in most places. But I
also need to know what parts I will need to repair the overflow system on
top of the fuel tank also. I want to make sure that I have everything
accounted for before I start because the Vanagon is my daily driver. Not to
mention that the local VW shop keeps business hours only, and we all know
how many times we've heard &quot;I have to order that part&quot;

On another note, I just wanted to thank everyone on the list and especially
the people who created this wonderful tool. I've been on about 5 months now
and last night I had my first break down that left me working on the side
of the highway. After reading all of the warnings from you people, about
coolant problems in particular. I have made it a habit to check my temp and
coolant level as much as I check my speed. This little habit saved my
engine without a doubt. I blew a coolant hose, a small one, but had lost
ALL of my coolant. The needle never made it past 2/3 to pegged :) the light
was blinking so I pulled over and shut her down. Previous warnings from the
list had prompted me to keep all kinds of extra do-dads, (hose clamps,
hose, and ALL my tools, at least 2 gallons of water and one coolant,
something to put on the ground to keep the road rocks out of your back,...)
I was back on the road after a 15min cool down, ( for the engine, and me,
after looking at coolant that at first appeared to be coming from the PS
head gasket. Boy! that gets you heart racing ! ) and about 20 min work. It
turns out to be the small hose coming out of the motor to the expansion
tank. Didn't have any hose that size so I used the hose between the two
expansion tanks, filled her up with water and away I went to the closest
gas station to get extra water for the rest of the ride home. Stopped
several times to top off the coolant, seems to get enough of the air out to
at least get me home. Finished it up at home, and all is well. 

Thanks again! :) 
Happy 4th of July Vanagoning!
