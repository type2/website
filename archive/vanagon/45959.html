Subject: 77 bus for sale, Baltimore, report

For all you wannabusers(I know there are many):

Just looked at a 77 for sale right by my house.

Its the normal 2.0L, FI, 4 spd transmission.

Repainted recently, original red/white.  Fairly good paint job, 
some surface rust present here/there.
I only found 1 hole, in the sliding door.  Not a huge deal yet, 
though the door will need to be replaced in a year or so.

New parts include electric fuel pump, windshield, starter, tune up, 
exhaust system.

Drives nicely, albeit very slow.  Didn't have time for a compression check.

Odometer and owner say 71,000 orig miles, although it feels MUCH slower 
than my 79 with 210K miles.

Asking price $3000, would accept $2750(still very high)

Overall: real good body, good running motor, but sluggish

410/667-1057

Paul
