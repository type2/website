Subject: V6anagon further update


Well, a slight update.

I just called four different VW places-- two dealer service departments
and two independent repair places who advertise that they specialize
in VWs (have you ever wondered about shops that say they specialize in
both domestic and foreign cars? What's wrong with this picture). I asked
them how snug the pilot bearing should be on the tranny input shaft,
and how I can tell if the input shaft is worn.

All four said that the bearing should have &quot;a little bit&quot; of play or
looseness on the shaft. It was hard to describe it over the phone, of
course, but what they described, sounded pretty much like what I saw
in the V6anagon when I slipped the new pilot bearing over the shaft.

They also said that, if the trans input shaft is worn, I will be able
to see a step, or at least feel one, in the shaft, about where the pilot
bearing ends. I had examined the shaft closely, and found no sign of any
such step, or scoring, or etc.-- from the splines to the end of the
shaft, it was smooth and clean.

So why in h*ll does this thing vibrate and eat clutches? When I got it
going yesterday, I *babyed* the clutch and tranny bigtime-- but it
vibrated and rattled just as much as it ever has, which is a LOT more
than any other car I've owned. The way the shift handle rattles harshly
at 3,000 rpm, is especially strange. The PO had mentioned this to me,
long before I ever bought the car from him, so it's not a recent 
development.

Bill Kennedy pointed out that exhaust configuration can sometimes promote
resonance in restricted rpm ranges, and strange, loud noises generally,
but also mentioned that this would not damage clutches per se.

Stay tuned for our next exciting installment of the V6anagon
chronicles... zzzzz....
