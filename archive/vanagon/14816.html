Subject: RE: Whistling Gland

Well after reading the responses to my whistling problem on my 71 (which 
stops if the clutch pedal is depressed about half way or less) I decided to 
take Friday off and take a look.  Thanks to Joe Clark especially for his 
scary story about the loose gland nut--there's nothing like a motivational 
story to get you going.

I bought some parts I know are old and possibly worn--gland nut &amp; TO 
bearing.  I'll finally put some new firewall rubber in there while I have 
the engine out and finally complete the long awaited installation of my gas 
heater.   I checked out my spare transmission that was on my 70 and found 
that the input shaft had a lot of play--I'm suprised it found its way into 
the clutch, but it served me well.  I wonder how much life is left in it?

Well, I'm hoping not to find anything major (like egg-shaped dowel holes in 
the flywheel and crankshaft.  I'll let you know what happens.  I'm still 
taking suggestions until Thursday by the way, and then I'll be too greasy 
to use the keyboard.

Wish me luck!
