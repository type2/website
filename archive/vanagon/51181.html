Gerry,
I just discovered that Haynes has a wiring diagram for USA camper models
:)

I wish I could read these better :( but mine shows the water pump as
being connected to the LED panel in at least one place, but due to my
inability to read wiring diagrams, I can't really tell what's going on
there.  I still have no idea what I did but it does look as if the
refrigerator circuit is separate from the LED panel, so hopefully I
didn't disconnect it.  BTW, do all Westies have a cooling fan on the
outside of the fridge?  I seem to remember that being discussed on the
list.  I hope I didn't disconnect that! :0

Anybody that has better wiring diagram skills, look in your air-cooled
Vanagon Haynes on p. 254 and tell me what's going on and I'd REALLY
appreciate it.

I'm gonna have to learn these things.

Thanks much,
Sean
