Subject: Clutch slave cylinder leak - 87 Syncro

Vanatics,
Today I discovered a hydraulic fluid leak from the clutch slave 
cylinder on my 1987 Syncro.  Normally the van is in warm weather 
(in Southern California), but I'm currently in Spokane Washington
where the temperature is below freezing.  I suspect that the cold 
weather has caused a seal (or seals) to contract and allow the
leak.  Since I'm away from home, I'm not prepared to crawl around 
in the snow under the van to repair it myself.  I plan to take it 
to a shop (likely the dealer) and see what they'll carge for repair.

Questions:
1. Does my premilinary diagnosis sound like the likely cause, or
is there something else more likely?

2. If it is a leaky seal, what needs to be done to repair it?
Rebuild by replacing wear components?  Replace?

3. What is this repair likely to cost?

Thanks,
Jim Davis
