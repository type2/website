        First off, the real VW nuts will tell you that the coolind system is
not inadequate, that you must be doing something wrong.

        With that out of the way I'll relate what I've done (I have a
diesel, but the cooling is similar).  I've put in a manual switch for the
fan and I run it on high a lot, probably more than I need to, it dosen't
hurt anything to run it on high (asumeing that you have a thermostst, it you
don't.  Get one.), other than it's a little loud, but then I'm in a diesel
(noise? what noise?  I don't hear anything).

        I also put clamps on the hose that runs from the recovery tank to
the pressure tank.  After doing this I have had no air at the radiator bleed
valve.
