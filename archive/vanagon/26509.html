Subject: FW: new thread re: 'single greatest car chase'



Found on the Fordnatics mailing list, in long thread about movies with
car chase scenes:

&gt;&gt; Well, In case you didnt notice, alot of those neat 'vroom vroom' sounds
&gt;&gt; you hear are dubbed. I also didnt know you could see the tach in the car
&gt;
&gt;You want to hear STUPID!  I was watching a Mexican movie from the mid or
&gt;early '70's.  It involved a lot of car &quot;racing&quot;.  Anyway, Fords were
&gt;pretty common in these races, unusual dorky stuff, like a 4 door LTD with
&gt;a hood scoop and blacked out hood.  Looked like a Mexican factory
&gt;option.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway.  To the stupid part.  I suppose since V8's suck down gas and
&gt;Mexicans for the most part are not rich, most own 4 cylinder cars
&gt;probably.  So some schmuck dubbed in a VOLKSWAGEN AIR COOLED soundtrack
&gt;onto the drag races with the Fords!  Talk about weird to watch.
