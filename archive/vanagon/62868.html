Subject: Thinking of Buying '84 Westy - Still

We drove the Westy tonight - 148K miles, original engine, 2 yr old 
transmission.  Owner wants $3000.  I'm leaning toward $2000, but don't 
know if this is too low. . .  however:

The oil light came on and flickered after running about 30 
minutes - has anyone seen this before?  Also had some lifter noise and 
ran a little rough - but it'd been sitting for a while (my '85 Quantum 
does the same thing if it sits for a week - but I know its quirks!). 

Also - there may be a problem with the propane tank (current owner says
he couldn't fill it the last time, and hadn't used it much in the two
years he had it).  Didn't check out the fridge - any problems to look
for?  I also think the brakes may need some work (pulsed a bit when
applied with some force).

We're getting it emissions tested tomorrow.  We would really like to buy 
it, but would also really like to *use* it (VA to VT and back) before it 
becomes a project.  Suggestions/advice?

Thanks,
