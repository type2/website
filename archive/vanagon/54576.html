&gt; &gt; Well, you don't HAVE to remove the hub.  The hub and drum on the Vanagon 
&gt; &gt; are &quot;split&quot;, so you can remove the drum without removing the hub. 
&gt; 
&gt; True.  The drum and hub are seprable.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Besides, that way you don't need a giant socket, a hub 
&gt; &gt; puller and a breaker bar capable of 360 ft-lbs.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry.  Yes you do.  The drum can't come off without taking off the big 46mm
&gt; &quot;castle&quot; nut.  After you remove the nut, you could remove the two bolts that
&gt; hld the hub to the drum and then remove the drum without the hub, but I don't
&gt; see why anyone would want to do such a thing.

Now, think about this a bit....... The drum is a COMPLETELY seperate 
piece of metal from the hub.  The drum is held to the hub by the two small
bolts and nothing else.  Remove the two nuts and there is NOTHING holding 
the drum in place.  YOU DON'T NEED TO REMOVE THE 46mm NUT to remove the 
hub (in theory).

I throw in the &quot;in theroy&quot; qualifier because frequently the hub and the 
drum weld themselves together with rust, and it can be a PITA to try and 
get just the drum off.  There was a recent thread about seperating the 
two in such a condition; get a big hammer and hit the drum hard to break 
the bond between the two.  The other thing that can happen is the drum 
gets worn away by the brake shoes to such an entent that the drum has a 
deep (~1mm) &quot;valley&quot; where the shoe rubs against it, making it hard to 
get the drum off without backing off the shoes.

Since you just did the year brakes on the wife's car (and, I'm assuming, 
seperated the drum and hub while you had them off) run out to the car 
RIGHT NOW (I also assume it's nice and warm where you live) and try it.  
While you have your drum off, put a small smear of grease where the drum 
and hub come together so they don't weld themselves together again.
