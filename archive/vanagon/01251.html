Subject:      Re: 86 Vanagon start problem

HA! i knew that rang a bell.

Technical Information
Group 97, Number 87-05
July 31, 1987
Subject:  Engine cranks too slowly or won't crank - battery cable
Model(s): Water-cooled Vanagon, all model years

A slow or non-cranking engine condition could be caused by high resistance
between the starter motor and battery.

* Check that the battery is fully charged.
* Check the ground connection and battery terminals for tightness and
     corrosion.  Clean and tighten as necessary.

If the condition still exists:
* Install new starter cable of larger diameter, Part Number 251-971-228G.
* Install an extra ground strap from the transmission to the body.

hmmm. forgot about that transmission ground strap ... should be up toward the
front of the transmission (front=front of car). check it's tightness on both
ends. if somebody had a clutch put in, a bozo mechanic might not have done
his tightening right.

good luck.
