Subject: westie frig??

Greetings,

How long should it take for the fridge to cool?  Or even start cooling
enough to be able to tell its working?  I cant seem to get the damn
thing working on my new westie with either the duel battery or
propane...  its friday afternoon, have to chill the brews!

peace,

jeff
