Subject: Re: Highest mileage?

My '74 has 210K+. Of course, everything has been replaced, including the 
speedometer, one new short block, three top-end rebuilds, and a tranny swap 
w/ new CVs...

&gt;I'm sure this has been asked before, but I was wondering what is the
&gt;highest mileage any of us has seen on a bus.  I don't care about
&gt;rebuilds, swapped trannys etc., just how many miles has the bus
&gt;traveled since it rolled off the showroom floor?
