&gt;Sounds like you want my van. Though its more of a medium blue.

Here's the thing though, the '93 EV MVs came out in the following colors:
Bold Caribbean Teal,  Arctic White, Bordeaux Red Metallic, Jamaican Aqua
Blue,  and Deep Atlantis Blue.

&gt;From the above list Jamaican Aqua Blue is the closest color to a &quot;light
blue,&quot;
but even then, it's not all that light... is this the medium blue you have,
William?  I have the Atlantis Blue and it's on the darker side of blue, as
any
good Teutonic vehicle should be.   :-)

Anyway, I think the T4 is pretty bulletproof (so far), but it's not for
every-
one.  If you can afford one I'm sure it'll exceed your expectations of a VW
bus/van/transporter-type vehicle.  Otherwise, fixing up that '88 sounds
pretty good too.

ps-we're switching over to another e-mail system here, so if this post
looks hosed, I'll just apologize now and don my full body nomex suit.   :-)
