&gt;The California Camping Crazies (CCC) wanna do it again.  A suggestion
&gt;has been made to hold our first anniversary!:  at the location of our
&gt;very first group campout, which took place a year ago January, at the
&gt;Pfeiffer Big Sur campground, just about 30 minutes south of Carmel, CA. 
&gt;A number of people have expressed interest in going, but we need to
&gt;pinpoint some dates.  I assume none of you will be in good enough shape
&gt;to do this the last weekend of December (giggle), but how about
&gt;Jan 5-7th?
&gt;

Well, I have to admit I am one of the semilurking instigators of the
reunion.  Now that Jill
(http://www-leland.stanford_dot_edu/~huguenar/JillPage.html) is more than a few
weeks old we are starting to think about camping again.  Last years
initiating trip was a doosie, (doosey, duesy, doosy?) with international
representation and the &quot;storm of the winter&quot;.  Let's see.... according to
David Schwartz VW page (http://www.teleport_dot_com/~des/vw/index.html), the
following folks were there:

David Schwarze...........schwarze_at_nosc_dot_mil
Steve Johnson............sjohnson_at_pcocd2.intel_dot_com
Tobin Copley.............tobin_at_unixg.ubc_dot_ca
Bill Abbott..............wabbott_at_townshend.corp.megatest_dot_com
Jeff Schneiter...........jeffs_at_almaden.ibm_dot_com
Bradley M................bradleym_at_netcom_dot_com
Steve Wall...............wall_at_mcm_dot_com 
Dave Garth...............dgarth_at_cymbal_dot_calpoly_dot_edu 
Martha Rubin.............nrubin_at_s1.csuhayward_dot_edu 
John Huguenard...........hugie_at_lindy.stanford_dot_edu 

Of course, some of the account names have changed since then. Maybe most of
them, in fact!  

So can we entice Tobin &amp; Christa down again??  I doubt it, since they were
definitely not impressed by the weather.  They did leave some nice prunes,
though!

David S. drove a long way last year, and the rest of us were from the bay
area.  
Arriving at about 9-10PM on Friday night Carol, Tonto, and I were surprised
to find 7 buses already there, even in that weather.  And delicious food and
spirits.  

So I think that the we expect that the weather couldn't possibly be worse.
And Pfeiffer, a beautiful spot, is relatively empty in the winter time.

So I'll chime in with a second for the 5th-7th of Jan.

Any other takers????

John
