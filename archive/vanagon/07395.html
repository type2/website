Subject: Vanagon-Bug Motor Parts (shared)

In the latest issue of Hot VWs a writer enquires about high performance water
cooled motor parts and the editors respond that there isn't much but they
also say this: 

&quot;Fortunately, quite a few of the internal components are interchangeable
between the waterboxer and the Type 1 engine including cam, crankshaft,
distributor, oil pump and rocker arms.&quot;

This sentence sounds like an outrageous assertion--hardly believeable. 

Has anybody else ever even *considered* swapping beetle motor parts into
their 83 and up Vanagon engine????

Right. I thought not. 

If you have given this matter any thought or study and you are reading this
post then out with it!  Share what you know.

----------------------------------------

The editors also add that they had an article dealing with modifications to
the &quot;Wasservoxer&quot; engine for performance in the August 85 issue. 

Anybody got this article or know what it says. It might be a good idea to
have it posted to the net.
