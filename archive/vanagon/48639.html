&gt;The &quot;plans&quot; I have for the type2 list name are to print stickers and

&gt;in the red, not you lot. If I can, the extra can go a few inches toward
&gt;paying what the list costs. It costs a good bit, *all* of it straight out
&gt;of my wallet.

&gt;(Getting this? The aircooled list is completely and utterly free for its
&gt;almost 400 subscribers around the globe because I pay for the bandwidth. No
&gt;tax money. Accusations of avarice are just a little hard to take when I'm
&gt;the only one paying out.)

I'm not demeaning your job as adminitrator, or the time and effort you put 
in in running, THAT is greatly appreciated.

But, yours is not the only list that is completely and utterly free....all 
of the lists that I subscribe to are....and so was the original V_at_L list, 
and the current config of V_at_L. Perhaps you should have thought of the 
expense prior to offering to take over the list. You might say that most of 
the lists I subscribe to are paid for, as you put it, by &quot;tax money&quot;. That 
may be true. But about the web sites I visit...Thom's, Ron's, Tom's Synchro 
site, etc....these are not on &quot;tax money&quot; systems...they are on 
fee-for-service systems...and I don't see them asking to buy shirts, etc., 
or directly ask for money to defray their costs... 


&gt;I have no intention of ever trying to make a profit off the list. I do it
&gt;because I love Busses and I love the people involved; they (and you) are
&gt;excellent people. But I *might* not be reviled for trying to mitigate the
&gt;cost of bringing it to its subscribers by selling them something they want
&gt;to buy at prices they agree to pay. And if stickers and T-shirts were a
&gt;gold mine, then Poor Richard wouldn't still be poor, would he?


I guess you miss the point on &quot;Poor Richard&quot;. Richard never had the 
intention of making a profit. In fact, if my memory serves me well, when 
he'd volunteer to do shirts or stickers, he based his price on what it cost 
him...not what it cost him PLUS a profit margin. In the long run he lost 
money...perhaps not actuall dollars, but in opportunity costs...he could 
have been engaged in someother activity which would make him money rather 
than making shirts. BTW, Richard also has a web page, and you don't hear him 
talk about marketing his shirts to pay for his &quot;free&quot; service.

Perhaps to be fair to all, we should adopt Tim Smith's suggestion....you 
print shirts with TYPE2 on it, and keep V_at_L references off your stuff...


Maybe the bottom line of what is bothering me here is that you are the first 
list admin. that I know who has been direct about asking for money, or 
selling items to pay for list expenses. Perhaps I'm just spoiled in that 
I've never had to pay (directly or indirectly) for the services of a list.

Ok...I did have to pay once, and gladly I might add...and that was when Dave 
Shwarze asked for voluntary contributions for Gerry's beer...
