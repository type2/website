&gt; uhhhhh. well, you sure it wasn't 'Carat'?? that's just another name for

&gt; then it sounds like someone has been  playing games with the name-badges on
&gt; the back of the car (like i did). :)

Sorry, It was Carat.  I knew I should have asked yesterday before I forgot.

Anyway, I thought that GL meant higher prices and trim levels.  Is this
better, bigger smaller or just newer?
