Subject: Re: Get Yer List Stickers here!!!

&gt;POSTAGE:
&gt; for up to 7 stickers, use one 32-cent stamp
&gt; for 8-15, use two 32-cent stamps
&gt; and add stamps for additional stickers.
&gt;
&gt;Non-USA orders, please send an extra $3.00 for postage. (in USA cash)

Hmm, let's see, 32 cents for a stamp, but send $3.00 for postage. &quot;Poor
Richard&quot; won't be poor for long. 

Richard, perhaps you should rephrase that to &quot;overseas orders&quot;, because,
Canada just happens to be stuck on your northern frontier and isn't as
furrin' as you may think. Typically, postage costs more between Canada &amp;
the U.S., but usually in the order of 20 cents, or maybe two first class
stamps, I do not remember, but cetainly not $3.00.

How about if the Canadians sent you a self addressed envelope and a US buck
for postage? Sound fair?

Dennis
