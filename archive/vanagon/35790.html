Subject: ccc's location change!


Everyone note - the previously designated location of Peppermint
will unfortunately not be open, we've found out, and so would like
to move the camp to another location.  The next likely choice seems
Dave's suggestion of Long Valley, and I've included his description
below.  He originally thought this was at a higher elevation than
Peppermint, but it turns out to be at about 5k feet, so have indicated
that change below..

        This campground is waaaaay away from everything.  It's about a 20
mile drive North of highway 178 near Onyx.  In the extreme Southern tip
of the Sequoia Nat'l Forest, it is about 5,000 feet up and a mixture of
high desert terrain and pine trees.  There is a small creek running
behind the campground, and a mine tunnel nearby.  The biggest advantage
of this place is that it is *so* remote that we could burn or blow up
anything we wanted without fear of bothering anyone.  ARE YOU LISTENING
BRADLEY?  :)  I believe it's also free.  Oh, the 20 miles is on a dirt
road.  It's pretty country, but can get a bit dusty at times.  With the
weather lately I don't think that will be the case though.  It would
probably get cold at night due to the elevation.  There are no hookups,
showers, or flush toilets, so if you're a pansy camper, you probably
won't like this place.  :)  Long Valley is pretty much due East of
Bakersfield.  It's a BLM campground.

I'd recommend bringing chains if you have them.

Caltrans has an automated 800 one can call for road conditions
24 hours a day, I believe.  it's 1.800.427.7623, and from a touch-
tone phone, you merely punch in the number of the highway you're
inquring about.

Now, to make matters even friendlier, we've reinstated something we've
done in the past, and that is to have a bay area number where you can
call and get updates (like if we get to this place, can't get it
or whatver, and we have to go somewhere else, so we can let you
know where we'll be, etc.).  That number (and please use it only
Friday, Sat., or Sunday, is 1.510.783.1194.  We
can change the outgoing message remotely, so it should be up to
the minute info.  Might be best to check it before leaving on Friday.
If there's no special message on it, it means go ahead.  

At any rate, here's sort of directions:

---

Long Valley is on BLM land, camp place #643 on the AAA camping map
of s. california, if you happen to use that one.  The phone number
they list there doesn't work; I tried it.  (They apparently now
have cold showers there, btw  :).  Anywa, it's 25 miles west of
Pearsonville, off Nine Mile Canyon Road.  Schwarze says it's 
more accessible from 395 than from 178, so hopefully he'll post
something definitive for us on this, and or leave breadcrumbs,
balloons, notes, etc.  

Now, as of this writing, 178 is closed from about 6 miles to 36 miles
east of Bakersfield, due to rockslides.  If it doens't reopen in 
time, then one can take 155 (kind of a difficult drive) over from
99, down to Isabella Lake, and then over to the hopefully open
section of 178, then over to 395, and then on in to Lone Valley.
For reference, this spot is about due north of the northern most
tip of where 178 makes a &quot;peak&quot; in shape.  But again, Schwarze
recommends going in from 395, rather than from 178.  

----


Anyway, let me know your thoughts.  Does this seem too much of
an undertaking?  Time is rushing in on us, and we need to make
a decision, as this Friday is D-day.  I'm happy to camp elsewhere,
like Bradley suggested, somewhere near Bakersfield, but close
to 99.  But if so, we need to hear from someone who knows the
area and can confidently suggest a spot that we'll like and will
be open.  Suggestions?  

If anyone needs to reach me by phone, I'm at 510.376.4321.
