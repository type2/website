Can someone send me/post more info on these tires?  I came in on the tail 
end of the thread and want to know what makes them so special.  Also, the 
complete designation of the model number would be helpful as well.  I 
called a local shop and they asked me if they were 2Ds or Gs and I wasn't 
able to say based on the postings I've seen.

TIA,

Jack
