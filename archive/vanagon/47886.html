Subject: Toronto Bug Show date???


Can anyone tell me the date of the &quot;Great Canadian Bug Bash&quot; or whatever 
it's called that is held out in Scarborough behind what used to be VWoC?

I fear that I must have missed it...  D'oh.... As it seems to be getting 
fairly late into the Summer now.


Cheers,
