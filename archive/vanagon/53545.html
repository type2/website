Subject: Coolant manifold leak

Hi all,
         Well I finally crawled under the Westy to find out which water
hose broke that ruined my drive home from a Christmas Eve party,and left
me stranded on I5. It turned out to be a split in the plastic manifold
that 4 hoses attach to just ahead of number 1 cylinder. I have read many
times on the list about a plastic part in the coolant system that fails
and that VW made a metal replacement for. Is this the part that everyone
has had trouble with. If it is then something someone said sometime back
is wrong. I remember it being said that VW changed this part to metal on
the Syncros. Mine is a early Syncro and the part is still plastic. I
wish it would have been metal. If this is not the part that has been
discussed on the list, exactly wich part is it?  Thanks
