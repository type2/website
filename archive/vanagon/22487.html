Subject: directions to August campsite/Wailaki


Here's the directions to the Wailaki campground in the King Range
National Conservation Area:

U.S. 101 to Redway, west 16.5 miles on Briceland/Shelter Cove Road,
south 1.5 miles on Chemise Mountain Road.  13 units.  Wheelchair accessible.  No
 hook-ups.  Pit toilets.  Water.  Fee $8.00.

-----

Jack Stafford, who will be camping with us from the list, has to be
anyway up in this area ahead of time and is going to try and check
out the site and report back to me via phone.  I'll keep you all posted.
I told him if it did NOT look good to just go ahead an make an\
executive decision and choose another campground nearby.

Stay tuned.......
