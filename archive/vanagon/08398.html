&gt;Tonight's problem was the altenator bearings froze up suddenly.  Sounds a
&gt;lot like what I would imagine the death sounds of a pig sound like.

actually, it's very much like the sound of a pig ... but not the death
sounds. it's the sound he makes when he becomes absolutely convinced that
you really intend to kill him and eat him. THAT's when the squeel starts.

&gt;I have placed a condom over the end of my oil filler tube.  These things
&gt;will catch slight amounts of oil which dripple out the end of the filler
&gt;tube without making too much of a mess.  This is also how I can now say
&gt;that I don't have too much blow-by.  If the pressure got too high, it
&gt;would never hold.

condom? blow-by? dripple?         nah. it's too easy. i won't touch it.  :)

&gt;Now, you might laugh (I sure have) about this solution, but the truth is
&gt;that condoms turn out to be extremely useful things quite apart from their
&gt;intended purpose.  Therefore, in your survival kits that you carry around
&gt;with you, I now have to also recommend a condom.

we used to use them in the army to keep water out of the gun barrels. and
to keep rice paddy parasites out of our 'gun barrels'. didn't work.

is it just me, or is this list getting really weird around the holidays??? :)
