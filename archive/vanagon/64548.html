Hi,  I just joined this list, so I hope I'm responding correctly.  I woul=
d
be interested in joining your little camping adventure wherever you might=

have it.  Union, OR would be a good spot.  I know Lil'Bago can make it fr=
om
Seattle/Renton to La Grande in typically 5/5-6 hours.  Also, the Blue
Mountains just to the NW of La Grande are really nice.

Enjoy,
