&gt;Get it coated with a ceramic material at a place like Jet-Hot coatings.  It
&gt;is rather expensive, but you will end up with a muffler that will not rust,
&gt;and very resistant to heat (to 2000 F.).  It will make your muffler the
&gt;last one you'd buy for a long time.

But what about rust from the inside?
