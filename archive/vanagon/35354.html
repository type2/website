Model Summary for 1986 Vanagon USA
Jim Davis 2/96

Eight models of the Vanagon were built for model 
year 1986.  These were: Vanagon L, Vanagon GL, Vanagon GL Syncro, Vanagon 
Camper, Vanagon Camper Syncro, Vanagon GL Camper, Vanagon 
GL Camper Syncro, and the Vanagon Camper Wolfsburg Limited Edition.

Colors available: Pastel White, Merian Brown, Savanah Beige 
Metalic, Marine Blue, Flash Silver Metalic, Dove Blue Metalic,  
Bronze Beige Metalic, Red Metalic, Wolfram Grey Metalic. 
Not all colors available on all models.

Distinguishing features:
There are several significant features to distinguish an
'86 from earlier years.  The most significant are:
2 Black plastic front grills (common to 1986-1991)
Rectangular primary headlights, seperate square high beam lights
   (common to 1986-1991)
2.1 liter Engine with Digifant fuel injection, compared to the 
  1.9 liter Digijet fuel injected engine in the '83.5-85 vans
Syncro all-wheel drive model available for the first time

The 1986-1/2 Wolfsburg Edition was based on the Vanagon Camper 
model.  At the time of this writing, the features that distinguish it
from the regular Vanagon Camper are unknown. 

Prices shown below are MSRP figures from actual window stickers and
other reference sources.  Where a range of prices is shown, this depicts 
the range of MSRPs found. The price ranges are not an attempt to 
indicate a selling price range.  These varied prices are likely the result of

mid-year price changes from VW.
