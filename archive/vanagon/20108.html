So Joel Walker says:
&gt; 
&gt; If you drive a Seven-Four,
&gt;    It's some better than before,
&gt; Cause it's now got E-F-I,
&gt;    Fuel Injection,  squirts your eye!
&gt; 
&gt;If you drive a Seven-Five,
    This loafs a blast to drive,
 But just in case you're bored,
    Valves still can't be ignored!

&gt; If you drive a Double-Seven,
    Uphill keep that engine revin, 
  Cause if you don't it'll die, 
    And there's no second try! 

&gt; If you drive a Seven-Eight,
    2000cc's pushing extra weight,
  One less thing to be harrassed,
    Hydraulic valves at last!

&gt; If you drive a Seven-Nine,
   You'll proudly say this ones mine,
  Sliding windows bring fresh air,
   Last of the bread-loaf fair.


Well...  That's the best I can do.
