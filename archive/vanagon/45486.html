Subject: Splittie 4 Sale: year unknown

I was driving up interstate 15 in Provo Utah this week.  I noticed a red
and white spittie in a field with a phone number in front.   From what I
could see (70 MPH) it appeared to have a pretty good body.  Don't know
much about the mechanical. 

I just called the guy so here is the scoop:
1966 Deluxe.
later 1600 dual port engine rebuilt, says it runs really well.  He had no
idea how many miles were on the engine or bus.

It has a California title and plate.  No rust on panels.  (It looked that way
from the Interstate)

Interior needs work.  He is asking $1800.  Phone number 801
491-9131.  Looked like it had a lot of potential for a good resto project. 
Wish I had the excess cash, parking space and time.  have fun
