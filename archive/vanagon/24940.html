         The Cruise Control

Oh, the stories we hear, like the stars in the sky,
    Have all been encountered before,
But just when you think that you've heard of them all,
    A new one will drive through the door.


Old Bill's truck arrived, dragging closely behind
    A huge Winnebago in tow,
And the RV was smashed in the front and the side,
    With three windows all broke in a row.

So we asked what occured to cause all this harm,
    And old Bill just said with a smile,
&quot;The owner was driving on I-25,
    As he clicked over mile after mile,&quot;

&quot;And long about sundown, he got somewhat tired,
    and decided he'd rather go eat,
So he got up and went to the kitchen in back,
    Leaving no one up front in the seat.&quot;

&quot;You see, they had told him, when he bought the thing,
    That the Cruise Control made quite a show:
You just get up to speed, push the button to set,
    Then it handles it all, don't you know.&quot;

&quot;So he pushed in the button, and went to the back,
    Thinking Cruise was now in control,
And just about time he had reached in the fridge,
    His world began to unfold.&quot;

&quot;The cops shook their heads after reaching the scene,
    Amazed at the damage so slight,
But to pull all the cars that he ran off the road
    Required all the rest of the night.&quot;


Oh, the stories we hear, like the stars in the sky,
    Have all been encountered before,
But just when you think that you've heard of them all,
    A new one will drive through the door.
