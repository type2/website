&gt;ok, folks. there's entirely toooo many 'Unknown buses' out there. i
&gt;know a bunch of you are Bus-Wannabees, but that only accounts for about
&gt;ten of you. howzabout you new folks letting me know what model and year
&gt;bus you are driving. and what city/state you are located in. just for
&gt;the sake of ... well, i don't know. curiosity? :)
&gt;

OK Joel, here you go:  I've got or JUST got rather a '87 Westfalia and
since I see from your list the &quot;87s are the most populus I just had to let
you and the others know that I have &quot;one&quot; also.  So far it's doing it's
job.  Broke the ignition key off in the gas cap, VW wanted $10.00 for the
key but got one at the local locksmith for $3.00 and he freed up the stuck
drivers door lock for free.  Then there's the exaust leak the just got
worse,  seems to be coming from the joint between the manifold pipes and
the right angle pipe to the muffler.  Two simple, little, ordinary
gaskets, $10.00 each, plus tax !!!!  Whoa, hold on here, what if something
really important breaks ?????  I don't want to know the answer to that one. 
Well, I'm up here in Carp, Ontario, Canada that is.

Cheers,

Frank  (also MGB bitten with  a '69 and  a '73 roadster -  plus a dead 85 
jeep cheerokee)
