Subject: Re: Cargo Hauls

I hauled a full size couch and various other bits of personal belongings
from Dayton to Columbus.  I had to strap the back hatch down.  I just fit
the couch around the Westy closet.  I had to pop the top to fit more stuff
in and on top of the couch and then climb up on the luggage rack to push
the roof closed because I could no reach it from the inside.
