Subject: Auto Trans Maintenance?

The Bentley manual maintence schedule (every 30,000 miles) says to:

Change automatic transmission fluid
Clean pan and strainer, replace pan gasket

On the Final Drive:
Check gear oil level, add if necessary

I looked at my '84 vanagon and there is a pipe connected to the auto trans pan.  Do I disconnect this 
pipe from the pan, remove the pan, and will this reveal the strainer for cleaning?

Also, how do you check the gear oil level on the Final Drive?

BTW, Thanks to all for the help rebuilding my 1.9L engine.  I now have 15,000 miles on it (my odometer 
reads 140,000). 
Our latest adventure was a 4 day weekend including camping on the Oregon side of the Snake River, and an 
indoor stay at McCall, Idaho.

Thanks,

Scott Maurer
