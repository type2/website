Subject: Re: Ultimate Vanagon Bra

Hi.  I'll second the opinion of the Colgan bra.  Excellent materials 
and well padded :)

Don't leave the bra on in the rain/wet, and wisk out frequently.  
Wash the bra on a regular basis as well.  I haven't received any 
damage from the Colgan on our van in over 6 years.

Harry.


&gt; The best bra I've seen is the Colgen Bra which sells for about $130.  I've
&gt; had one for the past 4 years and it protects well (just remember to clean the
&gt; underside frequently if you live in the east) and it remains quiet even at 80
&gt; mph.  There's a parts store on the Limbo web site that sells them: Volks
&gt; Motor Sport _at_ 408-462-9424.
