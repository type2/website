Subject:       Re: First oil change


&gt; 
&gt; For those of you out there who bought your vehicles new, when did you do
&gt; your first oil change?  After 1K miles, 3K, 5K,...or the VW recommended
&gt; 7.5K?
&gt; 
&gt; I ask because the dealer salesperson backed up VW's recommendation of 7.5K,
&gt; Conventional wisdom says to change the oil every 3K or so (or 50-60 engine
&gt; hours), except a lot of folks do their first change at 1K because of 
&gt; various metallic bits floating around...
&gt; 
&gt; So what do you all think?
I've had one new vehicle in my life so I'm not an expert but that 
won't stop me from giving my opinion!

Drain the oil on that new engine after 200-300 miles and you'll see 
the finest 'metal-flake' suspended in the oil you've ever seen.  Get 
it out of the engine ASAP!

BTW, when breaking in that engine, vary the engine speeds (slow 
acceleration and deceleration) frequently 
for the first 1000 mi or so.  This puts a strong vacuum in the 
combustion chamber during deceleration and pulls oil by the 
not-yet-seating rings and valve guides thereby providing more 
lubrication during breakin. 

 I realise engine break-in lore is akin to discussing religion and politics.
  All ideas entertained!
