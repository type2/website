Hello Sarah.

The *ping* is a knocking sound, like rocks in your engine.

Engines are designed to *BURN* gas; not *EXPLODE* it. If the air/fuel mix in 
your combustion chambers explodes it is called &quot;detonation&quot;. Its about like 
hitting the tops of your pistons with a 10 pound hammer!

If your engine runs with the timing advanced too far it will detonate. Set 
your timing no more then 30 deg BTDC MAX; 28 would be better IMHO :&gt;)

Running a lean air/fuel mixture will also cause pinging.

This stuff will kill an engine. If you hear a *ratteling* when you pull a 
heavy load, pull your timing back.

Have fun.

Douglas
