Subject: Easter van playing.


When my bus ('70 &amp; 2 litre) broke down a few weeks ago, I put it
in the back garden and left it for when I had some time to look at
it. As this weekend was Easter, I had an enforced 5 days to play with
the bus and to right as many wrongs as possible. As it turned out
the bike demanded 2 days of electrical work leaving me 3 days for
the bus.

Day 1 was remove passenger door and make up a plate to weld along
the bottom, as mine had completly rusted away. Maybe not a priority
given the other jobs that needed doing, but I was fed up with opening
the door and finding little pieces of rust sitting there.

Day 2 was to fit air conditioning. What A/C in the UK? Well alright
then, I actually cut the cab floor out, but it would probably be the 
same effect. 

The previous owner had responded to a rusting cab floor by 
welding panels above and below the rust and then leaving it alone.
So over the years it rusted from the inside out, only showing up
badly few months ago, by which time its also taken out one of the chassis
(sp?) members from the top. So floor and a large lump of metal to
replace. Also after digging around with a screwdriver I found
the passengers seatbelt mounting has more or less rusted right
out. A moderate smack would have smeared an unfortunate passenger
all over the windscreen, but thats ok, cause the screen needs
replacing anyway :)

Day 3 I took out the engine. Looking in the oil strainer revealed
a tiny lump of rubber and a small almost circular piece of swarf.
Nothing I particularly recognised as belonging anywhere specific.
Removing cylinder head, rocker gear and pushrods for 3 and 4
showed a pushrod from 3 with a completely missing end (on the lifter
end)!! Well that explains why I lost power before the oil light
came on and stayed on. I haven't stripped any more of the engine,
but I'm already playing `I wonder where the end has gone' detective.

Oh well. I may just chuck a 1600 in for a bit and rebuild the
2000 as and when finances allow. At least with all the welding
that needs doing, the van should be a good 'un by the time
it hits the road again.

cheers
