I just called, these cars are still available.  The guy wants $4000
for all 3 buses together.  If sold seperately, he wants the parts bus
to go with the 67.  This was advertised in the Dec. 19-Dec. 26 issue
of The Want Ad Weekly Classifieds serving Maryland, DC, and Northern
VA.  All inquiries to that number, please--I have nothing to do with
this sale.
