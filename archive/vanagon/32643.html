Subject: Classified questions

Hiya! Going thru the local classifieds this a.m., came across a gas 
heater for a thing, $200. Anyone know how much chance of adapting this to 
my bus there is? Also, different ad, bus trans, '68-'79,$150, and bus 
roof rack, $125. Is this within reason for the roof rack? I could use 
something to tie kayaks on, instead of loading them inside. Besides, they 
look kinda cool!!!
