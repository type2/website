Subject: VENTWINGS WANTED

To all,

I'm nearing the end of the restoration of my '73 SingleCab.
To complete my car i need L&amp;R ventwings in *immaculate*
condition, meaning that the frame has no rust on it, no dents,
and that the chrome isn't scratched too much. The seals are no
problem, i replace those anyway. Painting the inside frame is
also no problem. Glass is not a necessity.

Or, is there someone who has access to *new* ones? from Mexico
or something?? Maybe an American company who has 'em???

I really really need them, i'm looking for 'em since the beginning
of this project in '92, the dealer doesn't have them and the used
ones are badly rusted most of the time.

Any input is *greatly* appriciated,

Brian.
