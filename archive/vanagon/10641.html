&gt;	There was some speaking of an inspection plate with an
&gt;oil temp sender built in (this would be for a 2.0L).
&gt;Where would I find one of these things?

the last time i looked, VDO still made that (or had them in stock). it's
for a 914 engine, but will fit any Type 4 engine from 1972 to 1983 air-
cooled buses. be SURE to get a new big pink o-ring for it ... or it's likely
to leak. :) you'll need to get the oil temp sender at the same time (or you'll
have this big hole to plug up). most any supplier of VDO stuff should be able
to get it.

&gt;I also keep hearing this ticking sound from the rear,
&gt;CV joints?  I dunno.

if the noise sounds metallic, and is worse in cold and going around corners
and going up hills, it's probably the cv joints. time to take 'em off and
clean and regrease 'em. :) messy, messy, messy. but 'fun'. be SURE to use
much more grease than the vw/lobro kit comes with: imho, vw never put enough
grease in there. use at least twice as much as 'normal', and i'd suggest
using three times as much.
