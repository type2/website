Subject: CV joint Ball Bearing (and Re: Front Glass)

Hello All,
  I have lost one of the shiny metal ball bearings from my CV joint!!  
Somewhere between the driveway and my shop (back porch), it must have 
fallen out.   The CVs are in fine shape.  Can I just put another ball in 
there, or am I SOL?   Anybody have a spare CV ball bearing?

  I have had a recent experience with (human) body parts and (auto) 
windshield glass.  In a head on collission at a total speed of about 30 
mph, I was thrown from my bicycle (careful with those airhorn comments 
folks) into your standard American quality windshield.  At 215 pounds, I 
was surprised that the only part of me that made it through the 
windshield was my elbow.  Only around that area did the glass shatter 
enough to cut and slice.   The whole windshield was rather concave, so 
I'm thankful it wasn't the tempered variety.  In this case, HOORAY for 
seemingly overprotective US safety standards.  Old fashioned glass would 
have shredded me to pieces and landed me in the (idiotic) driver's lap, 
and European-standard glass would have probably broken a few bones before 
shattering.

&gt; No. &quot;Glass&quot; in Hollywood movies is not real glass at all but a movie prop
&gt; made specifically for breaking while not killing anyone.  Any body part going
&gt; through real glass (tempered, laminated, whatever) would be inevitibly cut.
&gt;  The way they do it in the movies they would be cut to shreds if it were real
&gt; glass.
