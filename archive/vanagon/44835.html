Hey Group,

Can anyone help this guy?

He is a fellow professional who is discovering the joys of working on a
Wasserboxer.

I'm sure that he will appreciate any help that he might get.

&gt;Hello again from the &quot;cheers garage&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Well, I thought we knew a lot about european engines, but now with head
&gt;gasket (coolant jacket gasket actually) renewal on the VW waterboxer 2.1 we
&gt;have been humbled..again.
&gt;
&gt;Seems as though this engine has wet sleeves and about five special tools are
&gt;needed to remove the piston pins and circlips so that the nasty little O
&gt;ring at the bottom of the sleeve can be replaced. The sleeves, of course,
&gt;come right with you when the heads are loose.
&gt;
&gt;On a search right now for the special tools that looks promising.
&gt;Any hints of danger danger danger do not do this that we should look out
&gt;for? Downloaded the procedure from Alldata and they seem to think we have to
&gt;remove the crankshaft pully to accomplish this..hmmmm.
&gt;
&gt;thanks again group!
