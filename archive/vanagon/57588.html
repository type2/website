Subject: power loss '81

Well heading out to our first camping trial of our new '81 Westie today, we
experienced an engine problem that forced us to return home.  I should be
camping and fishing now, but I am sitting in front of the computer instead...

Anyway, the van has NO power at low RPM, and not too much at higher RPM.

Last week, it ran fine.  Started easily, idled well (except when cold, when
the idle was too low) and ran fine.  It isn't a dragster, but it did fine,
accelerating to 65 on the expressway.

Today it wouldn't get out of it's own way.  When we drove off, it had
trouble accelerating past about 40 MPH.  I had to shift into 2d on medium
hills (auto), and top speed was about 45 on the level.

The problem worsened.  Before long, I had to shift into 1st on hills, and
had to drive most of the way home in 2d.

The van still idles and starts OK.  It will rev fine in neutral, but will
almost not move the van from a standing start.  When you put it in gear,
RPM drops to nothing (doesn't kill), and the van won't move.  To get home,
every time I had to stop (twice -- luckily we live in a rural area) I had
to rev it a little and then put it in gear.  Still it didn't really want to
go, but at maybe 5 MPH, it would start running better, although still
without much power.

All the vacuum lines are still attached.  We removed the air cleaner
temporarily -- no change.  It was getting gas -- in fact was only getting
10 MPG.  Cap, rotor, wires and plugs are new a month ago.

Where do I look next?  Any ideas would be gratefully accepted.  Please
remember I am a beginner with air cooled engines.

  Thanks,


Bill
