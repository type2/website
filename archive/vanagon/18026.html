Tom sez:

&gt;     &gt;1987-1/2 Vanagon Syncro Westfalia, A/C, 5-spd, every option, locking
&gt;     &gt;differential, 87K miles. New: alarm, complete brakes, tires,
&gt;     &gt;windshield, custom speakers, Ralley lights, curtains, top seals. XLNT
&gt;     &gt;condition. $17,500...
&gt;
&gt;     What? $17,500 for an 87?
&gt;
&gt;     Grumble...I guess if I don't talk to these people, I'll
&gt;     never get out of the Wannabus catagory, so I will.  If Joel would make
&gt;     a separate &quot;Wanna Syncro Westie&quot; count, at least I'd know if
&gt;     market forces will support prices like this...
&gt;
&gt;     So what is the difference between an 87 and an 87-1/2?
&gt;


An '87-1/2 is exactly .5 a year younger than an '87.

Boiingggg!

Seriously, I bet it's an '87 that was purchased in the '88 model year - as
they imported somewhere between almost 0 and absolutely 0 Syncros in '88.

I've seen '87 Westfalia Syncros ranging in price from $8500 to $19,500. The
median price in the Seattle area is currently around $15,000. '86s seem to
be running around $13,500. The price jumps way up for '89-'91s, roughly
$19,000, $22,000 and $25,000 respectively.

Oh, and be advised that vehicle quality does not necessarily correspond
directly to price. In my experience with Syncro Westies, the more use the
vehicle has seen, the higher the asking price is likely to be. Owners who
are really into their Syncros tend to know that there is a certain segment
of the market who will pay just about anything to get one, and set their
prices accordingly.
