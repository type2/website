&gt;&gt; DO NOT USE A DUAL BATTERY ISOLATOR ON A VW BUS! Sorry to shout but 
&gt;&gt; this point seems like it needs repeating as the isolator thing keeps rearing
&gt;&gt; its head up. The reason is that a VW alternator doesn't put out as much 
&gt;&gt; voltage as an American alternator and you therefore shouldn't make it 
&gt;&gt; fight its way through the voltage drop that an dual battery isolator 
&gt;&gt; entails (typically 1 volt).  You can do it, but it will take a long 
&gt;&gt; time to recharge your batteries. It is much smarter and cleaner 
&gt;&gt; to use high current 12 volt operated relays instead.
&gt;         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Thats strange.  I ran a simple RV isolator in my notchback for quite a
while and didn't have any problems.  What gives?  I had a monster stereo
in it, and ran the stereo of battery #2.
