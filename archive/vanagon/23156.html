Subject:       top bunk child/pillow net

This weekend i made a 'gate' to go across the opening of the top bunk 
to keep our young 'uns in place.  i used a pickup tailgate net per a 
previous poster's suggestion... picked one up at Target for $10 for 
the small/med size pickups.  it was still too long so i cut it down 6 
inches and re-glued it together with (what else?!) Shoe-Goo.  added 
some quick release buckles (for those 2 a.m. potty calls).  overall, 
i am very pleased with it and it will allow me to sleep better 
knowing no one is going to fall out.  had that happen once when Katie 
was 4.  i still don't know why she didn't get hurt and in fact i 
think she barely even realized what happened as she was so sleepy.

anyway, thanks to whomever had this idea to begin with.

p.s.
working on the van is becoming like fishing for some people-- almost 
an addiction.  i find it very relaxing, tho.  good thing i don't own 
a BIG boat... (twin diesels, radar, gps, radios, stainless steel and 
brass.  oooh, it could be serious)
