Subject: Re: No help in Sacramento?

&gt;&gt;Emmett Goldsbourough, president of the local NEATO chapter 
&gt;&gt;but not on line, is having problems finding someone to help him  
&gt;&gt;either check out a bus, or help him find someone to check it out. 
&gt;&gt;He is in Maryland, the bus is in Sacramento, CA. 
&gt;
&gt;I just talked to him.  The bus is less than 5 min from my house.  I was
&gt;hesitant to jump on this one because of my ignorance of Vanagons.  Steve
&gt;Johnson and I are going to look at it this afternoon...

Ok, I looked at it.  Its OK, a little worn around the edges, but no
collision damage, decent paint with a few chips.  Smoked clutch.  Emmett is
passing on it because its a 7-seater and not a 9-seater, as was advertised.
$2200 /offer
