Hello Everyone,

Found this one while web browsing this morning:

1993 VOLKSWAGEN EUROVAN, automatic transmission, dual air conditioning, 
excellent condition, only 21000 MILES, 1st come 1st serve, Vin. 010477, 
$12995, MARIN MAZDA, (415) 454-9240, Fax: 415-257-4688

Spoke to Bob Kaufman and he sent a fax stating that it's a CL, white 
exterior, blue interior. A CL means no cruise control so it won't work for 
me.

Good Luck.
Matt Dekker
