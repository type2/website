In case an article does not fit in its entirety, the user can request the 
whole article be sent to her. She does this by sending an email message to 
netnews_at_db.stanford_dot_edu with the word get followed by one or more article 
names in the message body. For example, 

mail netnews_at_db.stanford_dot_edu
Subject: you can leave this blank
get misc.activism.progressive.11965 ca.politics.38420
end

To remove individual profiles, the user may use the CANCEL command discussed
below. To remove all profiles, the user may use the UNSUBSCRIBE command, as
follows:

mail netnews_at_db.stanford_dot_edu
Subject: you can leave this blank
user joe_at_cs.oceanview_dot_edu
unsubscribe
end

Here the user needs to specify what email address the profiles are associated
with, using the USER command. This email address is the one from which the 
user submits her subscribe requests.

As mentioned already, Netnews is a very diverse source of information. To 
effectively filter the information, the user must be careful in choosing the 
profile. Say a user is interested in traveling and she submits a profile 
consisting of just one word &quot;travel.&quot; This is too broad a topic and the 
profile is likely to match many irrelevant articles that just happen to have 
an occurrence of the word. If she describes her interests in more details, 
such as travel hawaii, the results will be far better. 

The service supports two kinds of profile: boolean and weighted. The default 
mode is boolean. In this mode, you specify words that must appear in articles

received. For example, the profile &quot;travel hawaii&quot; in the boolean mode
matches
articles that contain both words &quot;travel&quot; and &quot;hawaii.&quot; The number of 
occurrences of the words is not considered. In the boolean mode, you can also
use the &quot;not&quot; operator to screen out articles. For example, say a user is 
interested in underwater fishing but does not want to receive anything from 
the alt.* newsgroups. She can send the profile &quot;underwater fishing not alt.&quot;

The weighted mode provides some kind of &quot;similarity&quot; matching. You specify a 
number of words; for each article, a score is computed based on the number of

occurrences of these words in the article. An article with a score higher
than
a certain threshold is returned.

In the weighted mode, it is important to set the threshold appropriately. A 
good way to pick the appropriate threshold is to use the test run (for WWW)
or
search (for email) function. This will perform a search over the previous 
day's news articles, and by looking at the scores of the articles returned, 
you can decide what is the minimum score for an article to be relevant. A 
basic rule of thumb is that if you set a high threshold (say 90), then only 
articles that contain most of the words in the profile will be returned. And 
if set a low threshold (say 10), then articles that match any of the words in

the profile will be returned. The default threshold is set to 60.

User messages should be sent to netnews_at_db.stanford_dot_edu. The subject field of
the message is ignored. Each message is a request to the service. Each
request consists of a number of commands. Each command must start with a new
line with no leading spaces. Continuation lines begin with a space or a tab.
All commands are case-insensitive. 

Requests are associated with the return address of the user message. Service
replies and deliveries will be sent to that address. 

The usages of the commands are as follows.

To subscribe for articles, use these commands:

SUBSCRIBE word word ...        Subscribe for articles relevant to the profile
                               specified by &lt;word&gt;'s. Two types of profiles 
                               are supported: weighted and boolean. For 
                               boolean profiles, you first specify words that
                               must all appear in a matching article, and
then
                               words that must not be in, separated by the
word
                               &quot;not.&quot; For example,

                                   subscribe food recipe not fish

                               You may also skip the &quot;not&quot; portion, e.g.,

                                   subscribe world cup soccer
  
                               For weighted profiles, just type in some plain

                               text that describes your interest, such as:

                                   subscribe nba golden state warriors

                               News articles will be given score based on the
                               number of occurrences of the profile words and
                               articles whose scores are higher than the
                               threshold (see below) will be returned to you.
                               
                               The SUBSCRIBE command may be optionally 
                               followed by TYPE, LINES, PERIOD, EXPIRE, and 
                               THRESHOLD commands.

TYPE type                      (Optional - default boolean) Specify &lt;type&gt;
                                as the type of the profile. &lt;type&gt; must be
                                either the string &quot;weighted&quot; or &quot;boolean.&quot; 

LINES lines                    (Optional - default 20 lines) Specify the 
                               number of lines from the beginning of an 
                               article to be included in the news articles 
                               abstract sent to you. &lt;lines&gt; must be an 
                               integer from 1 to 60.
 
PERIOD period                  (Optional - default 1 day) Specify &lt;period&gt; 
                               as the period between notifications (in days).

EXPIRE days                    (Optional - default 9999 days) Specify 
                               &lt;days&gt; as the length (in days) for which
                               the subscription is valid.

THRESHOLD score                (Optional - default 60) Only applicable for
                               weighted profiles. Specify &lt;score&gt; as the
                               minimum score for an article to be relevant. 
                               The most relevant article is given a score of 
                               100. &lt;score&gt; must an integer between 1 to 100.

For example, to request a subscription for articles related to &quot;food recipe&quot; 
but not &quot;fish,&quot; that is valid for 200 days and gives 10 lines in the news 
article excerpts, send this: 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
mail netnews_at_db.stanford_dot_edu
Subject: you may leave this blank
subscribe food recipe not fish
lines 10
expire 200
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The service will acknowledge your subscription, returning a subscription
identifier (sid). 

( D . 2 )  G e t t i n g   A r t i c l e s

After receiving notifications of articles that may be relevant to your
interests, you may decide to see an article in its entirety. You can get the
whole article with the GET command:

GET article article ...        Get the articles specified (by their article 
                               ids).

For example, 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
mail netnews_at_db.stanford_dot_edu
Subject:
get news.announce.conferences.3670
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

( D . 3 )  R e l e v a n c e   F e e d b a c k

After reading the articles, you may find some that you like. You can provide
feedback using these commands:

FEEDBACK sid                   Provide feedback to subscription &lt;sid&gt;.

LIKE article article ...       Specify relevant article(s) by their ids.

For example, this message says that article news.announce.conferences.3670 is
relevant to subscription 1:

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
mail netnews_at_db.stanford_dot_edu
Subject: you may leave this blank
feedback 1
like news.announce.conferences.3670
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

With feedback information, the service may be able to better match future
articles against your subscriptions. 

( D . 4 )  M a n a g i n g   S u b s c r i p t i o n s

You can manage your subscriptions with these commands: 

UPDATE sid                     Update subscription with id &lt;sid&gt;. Must be 
                               followed by one or more of PERIOD, EXPIRE, 
                               THRESHOLD, LINES, TYPE (see D.1.), or PROFILE 
                               commands to specify the parameter(s) to be 
                               updated.

PROFILE word word ...          Specify the new profile for the UPDATE
command.

For example, to update the period and the threshold of a subscription: 
      
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
mail netnews_at_db.stanford_dot_edu
Subject: you may leave this blank
update 3

Besides providing the subscription service, the service also allows you to
search for recent articles that are already in the database:

SEARCH word word ...           Do a search of the database with the given
                               query. Maybe optionally followed by a
THRESHOLD
                               command to specify the minimum score for an 
                               article to be retrieved.

For example, to search for articles related to &quot;information filtering&quot;:
