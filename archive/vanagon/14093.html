Subject: redrock video


Sam/Susie Williams and I have some rare footage of vanagons scaling
hills of previously heretofore unknown unchartable inclines for
such cars.  Further, there are daring acrobatic leaps over rocky
rivers, gorges, inclines, clifs.  There's one shot of Dave Phillips'
and Dave Schwarze's van parallel parked at VERY ODD vertical angles
on a desolated &quot;road&quot; (and I use the term loosely) about 4 miles
into the backwoods of the Mojave.  At the next bash, we want to show
videos and exchange peeks at developed snapshots, but David Schwarze
thinks we may be able to do something about posting the video stuff
to the web as well.  Stay tuned:  &quot;The Offroad.Vanagon Channel!&quot;
