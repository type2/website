	On the subject of ATK engines...

	Back around 1988 or so, I helped a friend of mine install an 
ATK 1600 DP engine in his '71 Bus. The engine was purchased through a 
local auto parts chain, and it required no core in exchange. I 
remember the poster in the car parts store included something about 
ATK being &quot;the no-core people&quot;, or something like that.

	Anyway, we didn't run into any problems installing the engine, 
and my friend drove it for at least a year before selling his Bus in 
order to buy a Vanagon camper. I think he ran the engine with both a 
Weber progressive carb and the stock 34 PICT-3, and I never heard 
about any problems.

	This experience left me with a positive impression of ATK, 
for whatever it's worth.

	Happy Motoring,
