Subject: fuel filter placement

Hi bus folks.  I'm finishing up the reassembly of my bus ('62
Kombi with 1600 dp motor) and have a question about where
my inline fuel filter should go.

The one in there now is between the fuel pump and the carb,
kind of nestling on top of the distributor.  This makes
me worry because if it leaks there are all those wires right
there perhaps making sparks :-0  Also if crud comes out
of the 33-year-old gas tank won't it do bad things to the
pump?  Where do you folks put yours?
