Subject: Heads For A 78 Bus

Thanks for all of the feed back concerning the push rods.  I am going to use
what I have.

I now have another problem.  I got word from the machine shop that I was not
missing my valve seat.  It was still there but had bored its way up into the
head thus causing it to crack.

Is this common?  I have been told that type IVs are notorious for losing the
valve seats, but boring into the head?

What about prices and things to look for when purchasing a new(rebuilt?)
head.  I called a VW dealer and he priced them at $450 a piece.  Do I buy a
VW one or something like GEX?  Is all right to search a salvage yard?

Finally, a question of curiosity.  What do they do with the old heads when
you exchange them for a new one?

Thanks again

Todd

PS  I am still working on reproducing that sketch for the refrigerator so I
can post on the list.
