Subject: Hoses/Lines appology


	I owe Bob (Veeduber_at_aol_dot_com) an appology- he wrote 'stainless steel
brake lines' and I sloppily assumed he meant 'braided stainless over ? hoses'.
He meant stainless steel brake lines- the solid, fixed, ones.
	He's 100% correct, stainless steel lines won't rust. 

	Sorry, Bob.

	Bill
