Subject: Re: Any Single Cab Value vs Crew?

Regarding the value of Single Cabs...

I am rather troubled by the seemingly polar values between Crews and
Singles. Sure, most everyone would like to have the Crew advantages of the
extra passanger area and less claustraphobia that is found in the Single. On
the other hand I have watched trends come and go with the accompanying
vehicle value fluxuations e.g. Ghias (any) were priceless in the 1980's and
now (with some exceptions and converts) appear to be a hard seller vs other
VW models. 
I have seen several Crews that were total rats bought and sold for stupidly
high prices. (1. $3000 with divider cut  out and hoards of rust 2. $5000
Wavey Bondo/Fiberglass rat with nasty &quot;fresh&quot; white paint job) On the other
hand I saw a nice '59 Single for sale at the AZ Bus Club Jerome Jamboree
with no takers at $1700. The same truck was at Bug-o-Rama sporting a fresh
Dove Blue paint job, reworked motor, and decent tires start at $3000. in the
local paper, drop to $2700 at the show and eventually get trailered home
with no buyer even after being offered at a &quot;blow out&quot; price of $2000. for
most of the day. I hate to imagine what my '57 Single with hoops,
canvas,orgl 36hp and split case tranny (both set to the side), semaphores,
updated drive train, and rocker rust and patchwork quilt primer paint job is
worth. I will just keep it as a runner and not attempt another resto hell on
this one (for now).
I know the old saw about opinions (we don't need to repeat it, thank you).
Comments anyone?
