&gt; &gt; Why do you say that? How is it worthless?  I have cruise on my 1.9L with 
&gt; &gt; manual and I'm very happy with it.

Then Steve gangs up on me: 
&gt; I agree with Gerry.  I'm totally lazy these days and use my cruise control
&gt; all the time on the highway.  I tap it off on significant inclines and
&gt; resume when on the straight away again.  I also have a manual and would
&gt; only have considered the automatic if my regular commute would include
&gt; alot of stop-and-go traffic.

so i say fine.  yous guys have wonderful cruise control.  guess we 
know who WON'T be getting a copy of the instruction book.
