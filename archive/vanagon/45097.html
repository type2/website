Subject:       Oil Temp Revisited

Greetings all,

For those intersted here's a status report on my hot '57 Deluxe:

Well my candy thermometer has been treating me right.  Yesterday I 
took the pioneer on three runs.  The first was around town for about 
15 minutes.  After stopping and inserting the thermometer in the dip 
stick hole, I had a reading of 190F.  Outside air temp was about 75F

The second was a 25 minute drive primarily downhill at about 55mph.  
Outside temp was about 85F.  I measured a temp of 205F.

The last was the reverse of the second later that evening.  It was 
about 65F out, and after arriving at home I measured it at 210F.  

Someone mentioned that Muir says anything between 180-230 (?) is 
healthy?

The engine smelt of burning oil after the last run.  I checked 
underneath and think I figured out that problem.  My engine has 
started leaking quite a bit now (a good 8&quot; puddle every night after 
running it), and it looks like the burning is coming from oil hitting 
the exhaust manifold.- Mike White
