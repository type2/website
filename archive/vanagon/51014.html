&gt; Has anyone had experience changing a rear seal on a Syncro with the engine in

&gt; would have one. It appears that the seal is leaking though the engine is
&gt; pretty fresh, a VW remanufacture with about 12,000 mi., supposedly under
&gt; warranty. When I checked with the dealer about the warranty I was told that
&gt; they would pay for the part but not the labor because the engine was not
&gt; installed by the dealer, is this a scam or what?  If anyone has any ideas
&gt; about pulling the pulley or other possible sources of the leak (it appears to
&gt; be around the seal, the pushrod tubes, valve cover gaskets and drain plug
&gt; look OK), I like to hear them.

    Derek,

     My 1986 Syncro has the same problem. There is so much stuff
     in the rear of the engine,(skid plate, hoses, oil pump, sending
     unit, engine hole plug, exhaust system, engine mounts, the pully
     and lastly the rear seal) the only thing
     I felt I could do is wait untill the muffler needed replaces.
     Then remove everything in the rear of the engine to fix the 
     problem right. In the mean time I keep a close eye on the engine
     oil. My engine was rebuilt by GEX. I think it is leaking from
     the engine hole plug. I will remove everything I can, clean the 
     area up well and run the engine to find the leak.  I would bet
     this problem gets fixed sometime next July. (about 15 Qty's
     of OIL to go)

                        Eric Zeno
