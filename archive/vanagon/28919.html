Subject: 4 wheeling VT

I'll be four wheeling this Thurs-Sun in Vermont, most likely in the giant
lost high mountain plain that contains Somerset Reservoir to the west of Mt.
Snow.

No email but Vermonters can reach me on CB channel 26 and 26 upper side band.

90 Syncro Camper (together with 87 Toyota Landcruiser this weekend)
