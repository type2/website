Subject: [fs] Tires


I have 3 (yeah, I know) Michelin tires for sale, to anyone who wants them.

They're 195/75R14, the &quot;RoadHandler&quot; (Sears re-badge) series, mud/snow, etc.

They have about 15-20K on them, with good tread and are in good shape, 
overall.  

Please e- me directly if interested
