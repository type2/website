 You should sell it to someone that will appreciate it and buy a rundown
jeep, blazer, or subarbun to do your dirty work.  These things will do that
work with liitle trouble and no one will care when it is destroyed.  You
will
also save a lot of money on repairs.  The Syncro Vanagon is an excelent
vehicle when used and maintained as designed.  When mistreated, it will
become a piece of junk real quick and you will hold a grudge against the
breed forever.  Just my 2 cents.  Trying to keep the breed around forever.

  Hey Dennis WE have to talk.
  I would never abuse my Syncro. It's just that I get my use out of
  My vehicles. I no, I will find myself in the middle of the woods and
  have a need to get some work of some kind done.Therefore I want to
  no it's limitations. I keep my vehicles in top shape! tuned to the
  max., oil changed every 3000, washed every week, Engine detailed
  once a year. Brake fluid PS fluid flushed once a year. and on and on.
  I don't plain on this stump pulling every day on any regular basis.

  BY the way -- I'm going to replace the fluid in the trans.  Can you
  recomment a brand?  Also I think I better check the front axel. Is
  that fluid the same?
                                    Thanks for your help
