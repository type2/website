&gt;Do any of the Canadian listees have any experience using the Canadian Tire

&gt;I realize Bosch is the preferred way to go with the Brazilian wires next 
&gt;on the totem pole.

&gt;The cap and rotor sold by this store are made in Italy. Any comments on 
&gt;these would also be very much appreciated.

----I used CTC wires and plugs on my Nissan about 5 years ago and had
problems.  My son's friend who is a mechanic, and my son, refuse to use
them. They sent me to a FLAP  specializing in engine rebuilds.
