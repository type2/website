Subject: Re: 6V to 12V gauge again!

&gt;Bradley M writes that he converted his 6V bus to 12V,
&gt;but didn't change the Fuel Gauge or Sender unit and
&gt;it work fine (I assume that also means it reads correct).
&gt;
&gt;Can anyone else tell a similar tale ? I'd like some more
&gt;feedback before frying my Gauge and Sender.

Yeah. That little box thing on the back of the gauge contains a Zenner diode 
and a bulb (Honest!, I opened one up to find out how it worked). This 
regulates the voltage to 5 volts so it doesn't matter if you put 6 or 12 
volts through it, the gauge still only sees 5.
