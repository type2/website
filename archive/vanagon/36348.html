Subject: Re: Towing a Bus


&gt;It doesn't hurt to
&gt;write (with white shoe polish) on the rear window of the towee's vehicle,
&gt;&quot;CAR IN TOW.&quot;  If you live down South, or somewhere where most of the
&gt;residents can't read, this might not help.
&gt;
What??  Only two bites so far on such deeelishous flamebait?  Maybe I should
try that there Powerbait what's made by Berkeley... :-)
