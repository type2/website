&gt; Truma heaters runs on Propane. They could be built into the
&gt; Van in every direction, also underneath the floor. A timer
&gt; and temperature regulator are included in the delivery package.
&gt; Truma is a competitor of Propex UK with same style of heaters.
&gt; We discussed Propex a few weeks ago.

   Helmut,

    Did anyone reply to you with a sales office in the USA?
    Where could I get more information on this heater?

         Thanks
