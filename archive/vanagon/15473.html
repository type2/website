So Bob R. Kenyon says:
&gt; &gt;In a flash, the thought
&gt; &gt;processes were shattered by a quick utterance from Mr. Stafford,
&gt; &gt;which was, &quot;Burn the f-cker!&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe the phrase was actually uttered by Al &quot;No, Bob, it's 'righty,
&gt; tighty'&quot; Hubbard, who obviously felt that although we were all having a
&gt; great time, we did need to liven things up a little.

Doh!  I knew if I had said it was one or the other it would've been
wrong.  My humble apologies to Al and Jack.
&gt; 
&gt; And missed the twenty foot high fire and the coals that were actually piled
&gt; higher than the firepit!

Yeah, well I can't report on what I didn't see. :)  And from what I heard,
I missed a dilly. :(
