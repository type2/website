   I recently thought that I had burned a valve.  There was NO 
compression in #2 cylinder and it backfired fit to beat the band. I 
adjusted the valves and found that a very tight exhaust valve was the 
culprit.  In fact ALL the exhaust valves were very tight and when I had 
finaly adjusted them the bloody thing ran better than when I bought it.  
It does have a slight knock now and I'm going to go back in and re-adjust 
the valves to see if I maybe got them a little sloppy.  It is a very easy 
task to do yourself and I was surprised that it made so dramatic a 
difference.
