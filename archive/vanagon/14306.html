Cool, Alistair!  Is this similar to a Russian samovar?

What other neat camping toys does anyone know about?

If not toys meant for camping, how about a list of things you all
throw in when traveling - things not necessarily related to
camping, or to car parts/tools, etc., but which just make life
easier?

I'll get the ball rolling......

s-hooks
butane hair curler
solar AA battery recharger
inflatable pillow
bicycle pump
binoculars
magnesium flint
candles
collapsable sterno stove
credit-card-sized solar calculator

etc.
