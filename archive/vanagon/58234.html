&gt;Now I cannot answer your question but can you answer mine? It only drips
&gt;from the right side of the motor and usually leaves a 4&quot;dia puddle
&gt;overnight. Does this sound like pushrod trouble to you and are these
&gt;easy to replace if I have access to a service garage???

&gt;The van has 81000 miles on it and the previous owner had the head leak
&gt;problem fixed at the dealer 5000 miles ago.

Steve,

The pushrod tubes are covered/protected on my 1.9L with heat shields on both
sides of my engine.
I noticed oil seeping from under this shield and removed it for a better
view. I would NOT remove these unless this is obviously where the leak
originates. The shield is attached to the exhaust pipe/manifold stud nuts.
