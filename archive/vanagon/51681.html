Sean,

Try Kyle at Volks-Motorsports, and a member of this list.

I can't vouch for the struts, yet, but when I scrounge up the money, this is
where I'll get 'em.  I understand that other members have been very pleased.

Hope this helps..........

Greg,

  The price is stil;l $50.00 a pair plus S&amp;H charges.  The only tool
needed to install these is a screwdriver to pry off the little c-clip.

  If you want these shipped, e-mail me a shipping address and phone me
with a credit card # and I'll ship them out right away!
