&gt;really worked on, a '78, ALSO had studs.  So out of curiosity, what's the
&gt;verdict?  Anyone else have lug studs?  Did they come factory?  I doubt I just
&gt;happened to come across the only two buses in the country that were so
&gt;equipped!  :)

ok. this is what i THINK i know:

prior to 1971, ALL buses had lug bolts ... that is, the long part with the
threads on the OUTSIDE unscrewed from the brake drum, and left a threaded
hole. this made it a bit uneasy to remount the wheel, but supposedly is
stronger (Porsche and Mercedes still use it).

in 1971, with the advent of front disc brakes, vw moved to lug STUDS on the
buses ... where the long part with the threads on the outside stayed on the
car, and all you removed was a little threaded nut.

sigh. then in 1980, with the appearance of the vanagon, vw did somethin i'll
never quite understand. they went BACK to the lug bolts on the front wheels
only. strength?? but the rear drums remained the same as the 1971 buses  ...
with lug STUDS.

so (i think):
1952-1970 - lug studs all round.
1971-1979 - lug nuts  all round.
1980-1991 - lug studs on front, lug nuts on rear.
eurovans  - ???? &lt; what do you guys have??&gt;

anybody think differently??
