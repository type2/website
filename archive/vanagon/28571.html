Subject: Re: Synchro Crew Cab

&gt;A few years ago I saw an ad for a Synchro Crew Cab pickup and wondered if
&gt;anyone else has heard of this and if it was ever imported into the U.S.  I
&gt;think the ad appeared in a Northern California nickel want ad type
&gt;publication.
&gt;

I saw one in Tacoma WA. a few years back. There are a couple of 2wd's around
here also.
They all had gate pass stickers for either Ft. Lewis or Mc Chord AFB, so I
belive they were bought overseas and brought back by solders.


Hey Rocky! Watch me pull some intelligence out of the Internet!
Again? But that trick never works.
This time for sure!
