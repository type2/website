Subject: CCC's January 17-19


Hi again.  Unfortunately, I'm not having much luck finding us a
place.  We have a few options, including one a condo at Tahoe, but
I'm hearing from a significant number of you that you prefer something
more homey, rustic, and cabin-like, etc.

The preferred date is definitely Jan 17-19 for the group.  Keep in
mind that this is the weekend which contains the Monday holiday of
Martin Luther King day, and so many places are insisting on a 3-day
rather than a 2-day rental.  A few options worthy of being researched
for which I unfortunately have no leads are the areas of:  Arnold,
Pinecrest, Strawberry, etc.

In addition, there is now a possibility I may have a work schedule
conflict for part (or perhaps all) of that weekend.  I'm nevertheless
going to proceed as if I will be able to make it, but would like to
turn over this event to someone closer to the area (if not geographically
then in knowledge), and to someone sure to be able to attend.

Anyone interested in taking this one over?
