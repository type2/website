i think they are talking about campers. as to the maroon/cream, i've seen
a couple of those here in alabama, and one light-blue/cream-top ... it's
a color scheme that is shown in one of the brochures, but seldom seen over
here for some reason. maybe only the Standard models came in that? all the
L models came in the 'fancy' colors? or maybe a euro-version got imported?

looks nice, and it'll be cooler in the summer. i would have rather had a
color scheme like that (like my old 71 and 73 buses).
