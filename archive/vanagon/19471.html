Subject: swivel feet for valves

Tried to find the swivel feet at a FLAPS, but they only had the ones for
beetles. The guy claims that the ones for busses (I suppose he meant &quot;for
type IV engines&quot;) are larger. 

On the other hand, JCWhitney advertizes them as &quot;for all air-cooled VWs&quot;
and gives only one reference number.

Who is right?
