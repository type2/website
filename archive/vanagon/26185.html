Subject: coolant leak tracing

&gt; Many shops now have the materials &amp; tools to put dyes in the vehicle's fluids

&gt; don't know if it's a regular &quot;black light&quot; or something more exotic.

AND some list members have that stuff!  i used it to prove to the dealer 
that it was indeed the crankshaft seal that was leaking oil.  it was 
so dramatic, they went out and bought a unit for themselves!  the dye 
in 'normal' green antifreeze is a close relative of the chemical 
florescene used in all sorts of UV work, we use it for tracing 
failing septic systems.  anyway, while they do market a dye additive 
for coolant, the coolant already floresces under UV light.  BUT even 
that is only marginally useful with coolant leaks because they are 
just plain easier to trace with your eyes... look for either a wet 
area or a whitish-green crusty area.  often the coolant evaporates 
before it hits the ground.
