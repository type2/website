&gt; By the same token, I woulnd't buy tires that do not inflate to the 
&gt; pressure recommended on the door frame.  I have a problem now, however, 
&gt; because the tires I just bought have a max of 50 lbs, and the recommended 
&gt; is 48.  Is that cutting it close, or is it ok?  With bicycle tires, I 
&gt; could always inflate to exactly the maximum pressure and it'd be fine. Is 
&gt; this true of Automobile tires also?
&gt; 

	MAX COLD INFLATION PRESSURE is exactly what it says...and is 
	the tire makers recommendation. Whatever it says on the door frame
	is the VW recommedation for tires that meet VW's specification for 
	your vehicle.

	EXCEEDING the tire manufacturer's recommended MAXimum is a NO NO...
