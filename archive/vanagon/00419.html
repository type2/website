&gt; They do. You want 100A, 120A, 150A alternators? Dual-output? 
&gt; 
&gt; They are available aftermarket... and they're easy to install. If you
&gt; want pretty ones we can get them in all chrome too.


Some of the best books on 12 volt electrical supplies are actually 
written for boaters, especially sailboaters, who must live on their 
elecricity while isolated at sea.

One, for example, Living on 12 Volts, spells it all out. The author of a 
series of these is an smart elecrical engineer who speciallizes in 12 
volt stuff.

His company, in Washington STate I believe, has designed custom devices 
that optimize your amps, charge rates, etc. so you are always maximally 
re-charing the batteries without burning them. Very high quality, well 
thought out stuff.

Rather than a single recharge rate, his system automatically adjusts for 
optimization.
