&gt;Has anyone ever mounted one of those inline boosters under 
&gt;the drivers seat in a van ?
&gt;You know the ones I mean ..... as advertised in J.C. 
&gt;Whitney and the most recent issue of Cool VW's.

Yes, and I bought it for $19 at a boating store in Oakland. 4 in. diameter
and it's strong enough to get the air to whistle. It doesn't give
significantly more heat, but it definitely helps defrost the windshield.

The main improvement came from replacing the old paper hose. The inside
lining had peeled off and was actually blocking the airflow. I replaced
it with an aluminum duct and insulated the duct with fiberglass wool.
