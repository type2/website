Subject: Re: forced induction

If I understand you correctly, you mean to say the fan draws less
current at higher rpms.  This is true (provided that the Voltage drop
across the motor is held constant).  However, before cavitation
occurs, at the 'working range' of the fan, bigger pressure
differential at either side of the fan means lower rpms for the fan,
which would mean a higher current draw.

 &gt; 
 &gt; I have to disagree with you here.  The motor is drawing the maximum
 &gt; current when there is nothing blocking the fan (i.e. it is moving the
 &gt; maximum volume of air).  As less air moves, the air begins to cavitate
 &gt; at the fan and the motor speeds up.  Recall what happens if you put your 
 &gt; hand over the air intake of a hair dryer.
