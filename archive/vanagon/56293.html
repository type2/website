Subject: Re: **BIG NEWS!!** 

&gt;If my name and email address has been passed on from V_at_L to a 3rd party
&gt;I want it removed from any newly created list. The distribution of mailing 
&gt;lists without express permission of the members is something generally 
&gt;frowned upon. I trust you will have no problem complying with this removal 
&gt;request Ron.

I would never use list info for unsolicited mailings. Period. My only 
reason for checking it is to verify that people who claim to be 
listmembers, are listmembers.  This is because of the special pricing, and 
also for my own protection since I am offering check writing priveleges.
It will be used for no other purpose.
