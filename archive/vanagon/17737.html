Subject: Solar resources

Hey Now,

I forgot the thread this was related to but.....if you are looking for solar
resources the best place I know of is real goods (800-762-7325). I suggest
you purchase the solar living handbook($23). It seems a bit expencive but
the information contained therein is very useful.

I'm still in planning mode at this point to upgrade the battery in my eurovan
camper. I'm still debating on the larger gel battery or a couple deep cycle
batteries in series. Also I'd like to get a true sinewave inverter as apposed
to a square wave or quasi-sinewave inverter. Where solar panels are concerned
I still don't know enough about them to deceide.

Real Goods has loads of info about solar and other alternative energies.

A little kindness is all you need,
