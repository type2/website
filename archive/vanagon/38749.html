Subject: More Emission Woes (74)

Chapter 2:  Replacing the Carbs

I found a great deal on a pair of carbs at the local junkyard.  I was
poking around in the back, checking out all the old bus hulks(I was at
Bry's in West Seattle, they let you go out in the yard-it's great), when
one of the guys working there started talking to me.  Seems he had the
carbs off of a similar '74 that he'd sell to me.  I took them.

So, the bus is at the shop tonight getting them changed(No way am I
attempting to replace a dual-carb setup).  The repair guy seems to think
this will allow me to pass emissions, but I'm dubious.  This whole thing
has been an awfully long and stressful ordeal.  Everyone that has offered
help, thanks again, I may still need you.

I have learned a few things that I'll pass on to anyone that wants to
listen, and that is simply *get the bus smog tested BEFORE you buy it*.
There is nothing harder to get your hands on than an emission part for an
old bus.

There, I said it.  Now I can rest easy.
