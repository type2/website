Subject: '66 camper van for sale, Va near DC
Date: Fri, 02 May 1997 13:47:11 PDT

Greetings from a former listee,
       I have a '66 van I was planning to restore, but I'm too far into my VW 
Thing to take on another project.  The van is all there except for the front 
bumper.  It is the original dk. green and has one bad rust spot under the double 
doors.  No dents,all camping gear is there(albeit in boxes as I was in the 
process of taking it down). The stock engine runs and tranny is solid.  It wont 
take much more than some TLC and a little cash(that I dont have) to have a sweet 
stock split window.  I'm located in Northern VA, near DC.  I'm working on 
scanning some pics of it.  Hopefully have them soon.  I'm asking $1200.00 for it 
and its well worth it.  You can contact me at linobeggs_at_hotmail_dot_com or 
(540)899-0007.

keep on keeping on
Lino
