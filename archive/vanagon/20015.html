                         Thar She Blows!


The day after the geezer in Sandy Eggo posted the sermon on
changing a fan belt in the dark you stuffed a flashlight and
packet of fuses in the door pocket of your bug.  The sermon was
kind of eery.  It sounded just like the time you blew the fan
belt coming back from Las Vegas, right down to the part about
dropping the fan pulley nut and having to play patti-cake to find
it.  Now you're prepared for anything.  New fan belt.  Couple of
tools.  Flashlight.  Even got some fuses.  Drive on!

So you're purring along at seventy-five on the long straight
stretch of I-10 between Somewhere, California and Nowhere,
Arizona and your right headlight goes out.  It's blacker than the
inside of a coal mine cat and you've got one headlight.  Things
could be worse, except when you cross the Arizona line the odds
are the AZ highway patrol will do what they can to bring the
matter to your attention.  

No problem.  You are equipped with both flashlight and fuses. 
You pull over at the next rest stop, fight off the quasi-
religious kooks wanting to sell you a stale sandwich, and start
playing with your fuses.  Nope.  Nope.  Ah ha!  Ummm... nope.

After twenty minutes you've managed to break a good fuse pulling
it out, dropped two of them on the floor but finally have both
headlights working again.  Even with the flashlight and spare
fuses it wasn't quite as easy as you thought, mostly because you
couldn't tell which fuse was blown.  (Yeah I know, they got a
headlight symbol on the fuse block cover, but the cover was lost
about five owners ago.)

There's a better way.  It will take you a couple hours but it's
the sort of thing that never goes bad and never wears out. 
Here's how it works:  When you blow a fuse -- and even when one
is just loose -- you peek under the dash and there's this LED
glowing back at you.  The bad fuse is just above it.  You wiggle
it (if it's loose), replace it if it's bad and drive on.  No
mystery.  No fumbling.  Costs you mebbe two bucks.  Cheep.

The reason it works is because you've wired an LED across the
fuse.  Don't worry about shorting anything out because you put an
itty-bitty 1,000 ohm resistor in-line with the LED.  Twleve volts
across a thousand ohm load isn't enough juice to worry about,
twelve-thousandanths of an amp, just enough to make an LED glow. 
As in DIM glow; you'll need to peer at it through a rolled up
paper tube to see it in the daytime (or use a smaller value
resistor).  At night it's okay; shows up fine; tiny red spark.

So why doesn't it glow all the time?  Ah ha!  I'm glad you asked. 
Because when there is a good fuse in parallel with the LED and
limiting resistor you have TWO circuits.  And as everyone knows,
when you've got circuits in parallel Eye-tee is equal to eye-one
plus eye-two, which means...  Which means it won't glow.  But
when the fuse blows (or comes loose) the load -- let's say a
headlight -- tries to draw its current through that itty-bitty
resistor.  It can't do it, of course.  But it draws enough to
make the LED glow.  (The electrical formulas are interesting;
they'll help you solve some of your veedubs trickier problems. 
But you don't have to know the principles of electricity to make
it work for you.  Go on, see if I'm right.  Plug in your coffee
pot.  Or turn on your headlights.  See?)

Go down to Radio Shack and buy a handful of LEDs.  I used red
ones because I had'em.  Also buy a handful of resistors, 1000 ohm
for a dim light, 750 ohm if you want it to be brighter, 680 is
brighter still.  (I used seven-fifties.)  If you don't have a
soldering iron, pick up a cheap one.  Also some solder.  If
you've never done this sort of thing before, throw yourself on
the mercy of the clerk, odds are about five to one he will know
what a soldering iron looks like.  Have you got a little pair of
needle nose pliers?  Okay, try using a BIG pair of tweezers; not
as good but they'll work.  And toenail clippers.  The fingernail
kind will work too; toenail clippers are better.  All electronic
types use toenail clippers.

After you get home I'll let you in on a little secret:  I NEVER
shop at Radio Shack.  See those LEDs you just bought?  They cost
a nickle.  The resistors are a penny each.  No, I don't want to
hear it; you paid a fair price for onesy-twosy quantities, all
neatly bubble packed.  But if you're a hairy-chested electronics
type (and that applies to females as well) you hang out at
electronic swap meets and buy LEDs by the bushel for a nickle
each and eighth-watt resistors by the pound.  But even at Radio
Shack's wildly inflated prices this particular mod shouldn't set
you back very much.

Like building engines, electrical work is actually pretty easy. 
The hard part is building an engine that runs (!) and doing
electrical work that doesn't look like a tornado in a wire
factory.  The success of your signal lamp installation (that's
what we're doing) will depend on how neatly you make the soldered
connections to the prongs that hold the fuses.

The fuse holders are brass.  Dirty brass.  So clean it.  Take the
fuses out and make the brass shiny.  Try Brasso polish and a
coarse cloth but don't let the Brasso run all over; it's
corrosive; first it cleans, then it eats.

Nice and clean?  See if you can get the prongs to accept a little
solder.  Plug in your iron, tin the tip (melt a little solder on
to it -- wiping it with steel wool will help) and get the brass
prong hot enough so the solder melts and flows across it in a
smooth, silvery film.  Down where it goes into the plastic
insulator -- yeah, that thing you just melted all to hell with
your soldering iron.  (Joke!  Joke!  DO NOT melt the black
plastic thing!)

Did the solder flow?  Good; move on.  No flow?  It's not clean
enough.  Try rubbing it with triple-ought steel wool.  (No, you
can't use an SOS pad!)  Plain steel wool.  With mebbe a little
bit of your wife's fingernail polish remover (it's mostly
acetone).  Now try again.  The success of this mod depends on
good electrical connections.  There's very little strength in
solder, it's just tin and lead.

The electricity usually comes IN to your fuse from the bottom and
goes OUT through the top.  (Okay, it's an over simplification,
but let's use it for the sake of those other guys.  [Can someone
please check me out on this?  I want to solder the LEDs to the
battery-side of the fuse.])

Look at your LEDs.  Notice that one leg is longer than the other. 
Also notice that there's a tiny flat spot on the little flange
around the base of the LED.  (Can't see it?  Then FEEL for it;
it's there.)

The electricity goes IN the long leg and comes OUT the short leg,
the one by the flat spot.  That's how we want to connect them to
the prongs of the fuse block.  But first, we want to add a
limiting resistor to the short leg, and here is where I want you
to be very careful.

Take an LED in your right hand and hold it in front of your face
with the top toward you, the legs away.  Roll it in your fingers
until the flat spot is toward your right.  Use your tweezers or
needle-nosed pliers to grasp the shorter right leg about 3/8&quot; of
an inch (10mm) below the base of the LED.  BEND the leg at 90
degrees; make it point toward the ceiling.  Now grab the longer
left leg about 1/2&quot; (13mm) below the base of the LED and bend it
to the left until it is perpendicular to the other leg, toward
the left wall.  Make the bends very sharp, no radius at all.

Now we'll put on the limiting resistor.  It goes on the short
leg, the one pointing up; the one by the flat spot.  Using your
toenail clippers, cut off the leg about 1/4&quot; (6mm) up from the
bend.  use your tweezers or pliers to make a short hook in that
end of the leg being careful not to disturb your bends.  Take a
resistor and cut off one of the legs about 1/2&quot; (13mm) from the
body of the resistor; either end is okay.  Make a similar hook. 
Hook the hooks together!  Squeeze them tight, both of them.  Lay
the thing on the table keeping the resistor straight (it will
flop around the hooked connection) and solder the connection --
the place where they are hooked.

That's the basic circuit; LED + a limiting resistor.

(These things are hard to hold for soldering; try a pair of
pliers with a rubber band around the handles as a vise; pad the
jaws with tape.  Or use wooden spring-type clothes pins (the
plastic ones will melt).)

You need to make two more bends in the legs but you want to make
them after you try the thing for size against the fuse block. 
The idea is to position the resistor between the fuses.  The left
leg will go against the lower fuse prong on the side nearest the
floor.  The leg coming off the end of the resistor (the one you
haven't cut) must be bent to fit against the upper fuse prong in
a similar fashion.  You figure out what works for you, bend the
resistor's leg and cut off any excess length from both the LED's
leg and the resistor's leg.

The completed assembly doesn't cover as much area as a postage
stamp and there's nothing critical about the bends.  But it must
be securely soldered, and you must be able to see the LEDs.  Do
whatever works, so long as you don't create a short.

The circuit will be easier to solder to the fuse prongs if you
first tin the legs, so lay it on the table and do it.  Just a
little.  Be careful not to melt the joint you've made nor to
overheat the LED.  If it gets too hot, it won't work.

Okay, now make as many LED's &amp; resistors as you have fuses.  Late
bugs and buses have a dozen of the things.  And make two extras. 
(I'll tell you later.)

All made?  Okay, now we test them.  It would be easier if you
made up test leads with alligator clips but plain wire will work
okay.  (Some people even use store-bought test leads! 
[Shudder.])  You can hold the things together with your fingers
for testing; your skin resistance is too high for 12 volts to
harm you.  (You car's battery thinks you're made of plastic.)

When you apply 12vdc to the free leg of the LED and ground the
leg of the resistor, the LED should glow.  No exceptions.  

No glow?  You did it backwards, you got the LED too hot, you
aren't making good contact or you aren't feeding it 12vdc. 
Again, no exceptions; these things are pretty simple.  Figure out
what's wrong and try again.  If you need help, we're right over
there inside the computer.

Solder one circuit into place on the car.  It helps if you have
three hands, one growing from the middle of your forehead.  Or a
prehensile tongue.  (Hint:  Hold the thing in place with a cloths
pin while you solder the other end, then bend it into place and
solder.)

When you have one circuit installed, add the fuse, turn the key
and test that circuit.  The LED should be out when the circuit is
on.  Then pull the fuse.  The LED should light.  You're in
business.  Do the others the same way.

All done?  Nope.  You've got to insulate the exposed wire.  (I
know, Volkswagen left the prongs uninsulated.  We're not
Volkswagen.)  Get some fingernail polish -- you can even get it
in black nowadays.  Paint the wires and the resistor; thin coat,
please.  And don't get it on the LED.  Let it dry tacky and put
on a second coat.  In fact, put on as many coats as you want,
just keep it off the prongs where the fuses go and don't get it
on the LEDs.  In the years to come the wires would otherwise
corrode.  Most modern fingernail paint is urethane lacquer with a
very nice electrical dielectric; it makes good insulation.  And
it will keep things from vibrating.  Vibration is hell on
soldered joints.

Clean up.  Re-install your fuses.  (Use the new Buss GBC-type,
please.)  Test.  Enjoy.

Blow a fuse on a dark &amp; stormy night?  No problem, just look for
the glowing LED, replace that fuse and drive on.  

What's that?  You say What size?  Oh.  I guess I overlooked that. 
You see, some veedubs use a combination of 8 amp and 16 amp
fuses.  Others use just a single value.  If yours uses just a
single value for all circuits there's no problem.  But if you
have a '67 bug, the two headlight fuses are 16 amp, the others
eight.  So you install two LEDs on those particular fuses.  Make
one yellow if you wish, or install the second LED above the top
prong.  Or install them ALL above the top prong and put the
extras by the bottom prong.  The LED circuit couldn't get much
simpler, and the principle remains the same for one or two LEDs.

Blow a fuse on a dark &amp; stormy night?  No problem, just look for
the glowing LED.  (Ummm red/yellow on the end; better use a 16
amp fuse...)  And drive on!

Too long already.  Just be kind to your Bug.  Or bus.  Kids, too. 
And stop kicking the dog, we all have accidents now and then.
