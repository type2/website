Subject:       Horn



   Yea, it's a common one...  My 73 Westy's horn is shorting out.
   
   Could someone help by giving me the exact path of the ground 
wire from the horn through the steering box up to the button.  Is the 
steering box isolated from the frame?  

    I believe the previous owner had problems and tore everything 
out.  I'm trying to get everyting back to the orignal (I perfer not 
to have horn switch on the steering column).  

    Thanks
