I have the lug nut  torque values written on the drums. It gives the
stoned grease monkeys a good laugh at Tired America as they wail on them
with the air wrench.The morale of the story is to double check them.It is
so bad I have had the Van roll out of their garage with the WRONG
TIRES!!!

&gt;       Here's technical tip #2:
&gt;
&gt;       At the weekend VW show in E. Ohio we did a brake inspection
&gt;       on Vanagon rear brakes. It took us about 3 hours to get both
&gt;       rear drums off. The first problem was the lugs were on
&gt;       with about 1000 ft./lb's. (we bent my best 4 way wrench)
&gt;       Next problem was the brake drum center hole was good and 
&gt;       rusted to the axle.
&gt;
&gt;       The fix: grease!
&gt;
&gt;       I found the the VW lugs are very precision fit. Over
&gt;       tightening along with rust is the problem. Grease on the 
&gt;       threads and using a torch wrench, will prevent further
&gt;       problems here.
&gt;
&gt;       As for the centering hole: sand this area and the axle
&gt;       with sandpaper to remove rust. Then coat the entire matting
&gt;       areas with grease. WARNING: WIPE IT OFF, Yes use a rag and
&gt;       wipe the grease off. This area requires rust protection 
&gt;       but any considerably amount of grease in this area will be 
&gt;       thrown out to the brake. So you must WIPE IT OFF, leaving
&gt;       only a very thin film of grease to prevent rust.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;       Now... Do you think the next time the corner mechinic
&gt;       has to check your brakes, he is going to take the time
&gt;       to do these things??? I bet he even has his air
&gt;       gun (wrench) turned up full when he puts on the lugs!
