Subject: Gas Leak  (Overflow) Source and Access '84 Westy

I've experienced a spontaneous leak which I suspect is somewhere between
the end of the filler tube and its connection to the gas tank.  I've
reviewed BENTLEY'S, and (1) I can't figure out the route of access to the
connection And (2) is there a rubber or poly gasket, and/or is there a
simply-tightened device to remedy the leak?  

I've &quot;topped off&quot; by maintaining about a 7/8 capacity, so I conjecture that
the leak is above the top of the tank, at least, somewhere along that
filler tube.

Thanks.

Tom Hanlon
