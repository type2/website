Subject:      1.9L TD update,`82 D-Westy conversion!

Well,
My new 1.9L TD finally arrived on Wed. I've been ohing and ahing ever
since. This is quite a spiffy motor, looks like it will just be a drop in.
Modifying the engine mounts does not seem necessary, as is the case when
using a 1.6L TD from a Jetta or Rabbit. The turbo is much smaller, so it
appears there'll be plenty of clearance. The unit came with a factory
exhaust pipe which will have to be cut and redirected but no problem, just
having the flange was more than I'd hoped for...

Things to resolve: Air cleaner location and mate up to turbo.
                   Fabricate exhaust system
                   Pick-up tube extension for oil pump ( Scott Foss has all
the above, for a price)

I'm having my old DZ tranny rebuilt with 4.57 ring and pinion and original
gearing. That should be as sufficient as any, short of a five speed. It
should be back about Wed or so. Lots to do.

`82 Diesel Westy (soon to be 1.9L turbo, I hope)
