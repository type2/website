&gt; VW history that more than one EuroVan has been in the same place

Sorry to interrupt your moment of history but we constantly see several 
EVs around town.  All of the colors are represented and yesterday we made 
the mistake of walking up to the wrong blue EV MV in the Price Club 
parking lot.  Luckily we figured out it was the wrong one before we tried 
the key.  I pass a red GL every day on the way to the commuter lot as 
well as a white MV in the grocery store lot.  We now see more EVs than 
Vanagons around here.  We've even got the kids pointing out all the VWs 
we come across.

&gt; It was a great gathering...Pete Sellers was there in his
&gt; EV Weekender, Cetin, his wife &amp; kids in their EV CL,
&gt; and my wife and kids and I in our EV MV...
&gt; 

Sorry we couldn't join up with you but a family medical emergency came up 
and kept us home all weekend.  Maybe we'll catch up with you guys next 
time.
