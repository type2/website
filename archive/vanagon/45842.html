Subject:  Re-Wiring/Radiio to Auxilliary Battery (75 Bus)

I own a 75 Campmobile in which I would like to replace the aux. battery
with a new deep cell.  Once I have done this I would like to wire the radio
to it so I don't wear down the main battery.  Also, I am considering along
the same lines, disconnecting the electricity from the fridge and installing
a three prong 12 volt adapter outlet for a fan/cd player/non heating 12v
heater/etc. I have heard there may be an AC/DC problem.
     The reason I am going to disconnect the fridge is because it hasn't
worked since I got it and I am considering replacing the interior with
cooler material or any other better suggestions.
     Also, I got shocked pretty good when I was doing repairs on my sink
because my non-westfalia using friends stripped the knob so I replaced
the electric water pump with a small non electric foot  pump.  Works
Great.
      Any help would be greatly appreciated and I hope every one has a
safe and happy 4th
