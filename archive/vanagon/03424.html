&gt; And that he/she doesn't get their own revenge by destroying an innocent 
&gt; old VW bus when his/her mechanic says &quot;yeah, someone put sugar in your tank&quot;.
&gt; 

My families 65 split-window had that super tank-flap key to open the
gas tank. Wow, does THAT bring back memories of being 7 years old.
I gotta find me a blue and white  '65 Microbus to reclaim my childhood. 


I might suggest a locking gas cap is in order!!!
