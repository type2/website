Hi Eurovaners:

I've seen from the archives that I'm not the only one to have funky fuel &amp;
temperature indications.  From what I read, it appears a little re-soldering on
the back of the instrument panel can solve the problem.  Can anyone tell me if
there is already a posting on the procedure for removing the instrument cluster
and where to fix the circuit?  Thanks,
