So Martha Rubin says:
&gt; Speaking of rear vent windows for ventilation, does anyone have a suggestion
&gt; as to how I can get more air in my '81 westy while sleeping?  The mid
&gt; windows of course have the sliders with screens, and this helps, but
&gt; I'd love it if the 2 rear windows had this as well.  Is it possible
&gt; to find some of the midwindows at the junkyard and put them in place
&gt; of the rear windows?  Other suggestions?

Doesn't your year model have the rear hatchback screen?  I think thats
the best way to get ventilation through the van.  I know I've also heard
about some screens that go on the front door window openings too.  I
think that route would be less trouble.
