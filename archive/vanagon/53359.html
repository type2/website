Subject: Re: How to remover pistons from wasserboxer?
Date: Fri, 20 Dec 1996 17:30:02 +0000

The 1.9L pistons can be removed with rods attached.  My 1.9L had 2 rods
seized (overheated/melted) to the crankshaft, so I could not align the
pistons with the pin extraction opening in the crankcase.  I separated the
crankcase halves a few inches and gained access to remove the rod cap nuts.
A tight fit but workable (the seized rod came loose, but the bearing is
still bonded with that crankshaft).  Once one piston per side was removed,
there was vacated space to gently pound the remaining piston pin out (as
well as access to remove the inside pin circlip). I removed and installed
the piston pins with a scrap piece of wood dowel.

&gt;I have the engine cases unbolted but can't see how to get the pistons or 
&gt;rods out to seperate the cases. If this involves removing the piston 
&gt;pins, what is the best way to get very dirty pins out?
&gt;
&gt;What is a good source for parts for this engine? Is there anything else 
&gt;I need to watch out for?
