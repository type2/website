Subject:      Re: '87 Syncro Westie Starting problems

&gt; It sometimes starts with the key and sometimes we need to
&gt; push start it.  It is *very* intermittent.  When it does not start, there
is no
&gt; starter noise.

Looks like the solenoid is not getting the current thru to the starter
motor.
Do you hear a 'click' when trying to start, but no movement in the starter
motor?

In the past I disassembled one (it is bolted onto the starter motor, so you
have to get the whole thing out). Took the solenoid apart, cleaned the
contacts. I think I turned the brass contact wiper over so it uses the
'clean' side. Never had a problem after that. I don't know if that is still
possible on your model (mine was a '70!)
