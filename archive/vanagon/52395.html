There is the Arizonan-van where the heat is on all the time but comes with
out A/C. Phew! I have a few of them. I heard of a fella who had the
Minnesotian with just the opposite config.

BTW: Wouldn't you know it that I have had several calls for the 3/4ths paid
for '80 Vanagon by folks who need transportation TODAY!!! The fella who
bought it is right on time on the pmnt schedule prior to his taking
possesion of the bus. =) 
&gt;From one turkey to the rest of them- Have a safe and Happy Thanksgiving
