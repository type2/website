Subject: heater werks!

Thanks to that post about the guy in alaska with the gas heater knowledge.
He was a great help.  Now let me back up.... I bought foo (a '65 &amp; 1/2 
micro deluxe) back in december.  It has a BA-6 (from an early vanagon) heater
that &quot;did not work&quot;.  Major bargaining chip (I eventually got it for 67% of
his asking price) with it being Dec and all...Apparently, the fuel pump was 
considered a gonner.  Price from our local friendly VW dealer $350!  I wasn't
ready to fork out that and survived the winter with wool pants, sorrel boots 
(w/ felt liners) gloves hat, well u know the score...Communicated with this 
guy from alaska (I don't remember his name right off or his email address -
but I can get it if anyone's interested.) He said some times the pump diaphram
will get stuck either open or closed and try to free it with a blunt instrument
through one of its ports.  If that didn't werk, he might have one that does for a little over $100. (still ouch!).  Anyway, I gave the old blunt poking a try.
It werked.  The screen on the intake had a bunch of crap in it, cleaned it out.
Installed a gas shut off valve (after draining the gal and 1/2 remaining in the
tank - no gas baths need as per previous posts).  Installed the pump. Hooked up
wires where ever they were pulled.  Fortunately, the harness for this beast was
original so my schematic did make sense... Started her up and fired up the 
heater.  No! Wait... HEAT!   (now it's 20 C out but what the hey - I let her 
crank)  Heater died, no heat.... humm....  No clicking from the pump.  Tapped 
on the pump.  Clicking starts, heat again.. Still heating a week later (now, 
its getting to be 25 C but I'VE GOT HEAT!)

On a side note... As I was installing the shut off valve, I had to drill two 
holes into the frame to hold the plate that holds the valve.  I never saw a 
black (coated with undercoating) wire which I had knicked with the drill bit.
A little gas spillage around after the draining.  I tightened the bolts holding
the valve plate and started shorting out this wire. Sparks, some flame even (as
the undercoating started to burn) Quickly undo the bolt, whew .. still alive.
Should have disconnected the battery... Wait, if I had done that I would never
had known about the shorting wire.  Would have found out about maybe too late
as foo may have ended up in flames?  To disconnect or not.... 

later,

christian
