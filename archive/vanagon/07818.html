&gt;    So, assuming this is the way to go, these are my questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  What type and grit of sandpaper will work best to clean up the 
&gt; edges of the couple of holes and take off the larger areas
&gt; of surface rust?

I would use something coarse, like 80 grit.  If you can get a power drill
to it, I have found that those wire wheels work really well compared to
sandpaper.

&gt; 2.  These POR-15 people sell something that is supposed to clean up 
&gt; the rusted area and prep it a little better for the application of the
&gt; POR-15 stuff itself.  Will this really be needed since I will be 
&gt; sanding out the rust?

I'm not sure what this POR-15 stuff is, but I once used some stuff that
sounds similar.  It was thin, milky-white liquid that turned black when
you brushed it on rusted areas.  Worked really well - 4 years later my
battery compartment is still rust-free!  I don't know if you need their
prep stuff, but if is cheap, why not?
