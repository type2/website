Rick,

If you've only space/cash for one instrument, opt for the
voltmeter.  If your vehicle is air-cooled and you have a
generator warning light, keep it.  It is you quickest warning of
a fan belt failure.  

J. C. Whitney carries gauges of various quality &amp; price for CHT. 
After-market suppliers who advertise in the VW-specific mags
carry others, including VDO.  I've found CHT to be of more use in
aircraft than cars; on a long climb-out it's handy to be able to
'fly the gauge' since it responds much more quickly than oil
temp.  Because of the latency of oil it will always lag your
cylinder head temp. gauge but in a car things happen more slowly. 
A bit of experience will tell you when to take your foot out of
it.

An oil pressure gauge should be mandatory in all vehicles; it's
the engine's basic Health-o-Meter.  But keep the idiot light.  If
you blow a cooler line at highway speed you've got about fifteen
seconds to make half a dozen correct decisions; you'll probably
notice the light before the needle.  (Racers use a light the size
of your fist, plus a warning horn.  At speed, they've only got
about three seconds to do all the right things.)

Forget the idea of using two 6-volt batteries in series.  Dodge
tried it years ago and abandoned the idea as impractical.  The
problem is, no two batteries are identical, there will always be
a slight current flow between them unless they are physically
isolated (knife switch, etc) or you use expensive high-amperage,
low-loss diodes.  Parallel works fine, although it's best to jack
up your alternator output to about 15.6vdc vs the normal 13.8 to
overcome the voltage drop in the battery isolator/splitter. 
(Which you need because of the problem mentioned above.)  You'll
also find it convenient to wire certain accessories to one batt,
keeping the other for engine-starting.  A simple battery cut-off
switch will allow you to switch from one to the other should you
need the accessory battery for starting the engine.

While your alternator may have a rating of 50 amps or more, the
number represents peak output.  Buried somewhere in the fine
print you'll discover a 'duty' rating.  For automotive service
it's usually around 20%, meaning you'll exceed the alternator's
ability to get rid of excess heat if you draw 50 amps for more
than about 1 minute in five (they're only about 50% efficient at
converting torque into electricity).  As a general rule, divide
the stated rating by two in order to arrive at a constant output
(ie 25 amps 100% of the time from a 50 amp alternator).  These
numbers are relative to the alternator's useful life; if you
normally pull lots of ergs from the thing expect to replace it
more often.  Improving its cooling will help stave off the
inevitable.

With that as prologue, and based on your electrical load, you'll
find an 8 gauge wire is large enough to carry the load from front
to rear in the typical VW bus; 10 gauge is fine if you're just
going from the alternator to the batteries.  If you're rewiring,
bigger is better but make sure all terminals are soldered as well
as crimped.
