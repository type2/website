Subject: Re: Westfalia woodslat roof rack replacement parts

Try &quot;Part is Parts&quot; in Utah. They advertise in all of the VW rags. I was/am
interested in getting one of their roofracks, however when i saw the price
my enthusiam diminished. They haven't as yet set an official price, but the
guy quoted me between $400 and $500 US for the whole rack. Don't know if
they sell individual parts

michael

&gt;Does anybody know of someone who is reproducing replacement parts for early
&gt;Type II Westfalia Woodslat Roof Racks? They typically were seen on pre '68
&gt;camper buses.
&gt;
&gt;I've heard of someone in San Jose and in San Diego Calif. but have not
&gt;located these people yet.
&gt;
&gt;The parts that I need are the uprights that hold the alumnin tubing and
&gt;latches that secure the rack to the bus.
&gt;
&gt;I live in California and am eager to restore my roof rack.
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;Brendan
