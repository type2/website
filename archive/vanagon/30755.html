Subject: 2.5 Liter Wasserboxer-Ahnendorp

     As part of the continuing saga, checking out ALL wasserboxer
     engine options:

     Based on tips from Brian and Derek, my German speaking wife called
     Ahnendorp in Germany this am to inquire about the 2.5 kits.

     The fellow she talked to knew very well what she was talking about,
     but it appears it is not a stock item. He says many kits were sold
     in Africa, but there are not many requests lately. He went on to say
     that they still could assemble  the various parts for us. He said
     there were two major components, the piston/cylinder kit ($2000) and
     something called, in German, &quot;hub&quot; for $1400.

     Now, Michele had a problem translating &quot;hub&quot;. She thought it means
     &quot;displacement&quot;, but that is essentially what you are buying when you
     get pistons and cylinders, and the fellow she talked to did not speak
     English, and so we are in the dark.

     Only for the moment. I have an &quot;appointment&quot; to talk with Herr
     Ahnendorp tomorrow morning. He is fluent in English. Details
     tommorrow.
