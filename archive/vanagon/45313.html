Subject: battery tray comparisons..opinions?


hey now,

i'm in the market for a battery tray. bus boys has them for $45 from denmark.
i was at the local VWFLAPS and they have a tray for a bug for $15.95, brand
new, also from dennmark. will this one fit a '74 bus? also, i reckon you have
to drill a hole in the battery plate to fasten the battery down?

now another question...are there certain batteries that fit a bus better? 
i know when i tried to put the battery from my taurus into the van it 
wouldn't work cuz the battery terminals were differently places. ie--i 
couldn't hook the negative terminal to the grounding because it would 
either be to far away if i put it on the ground side or next to the back 
of the bus if i put it the other way. i guess a solution would be a 
longer metal strip which hooks into the bus?
