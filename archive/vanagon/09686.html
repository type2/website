&gt;Umm... along this vein, I'd like to know if anyone out there knows
&gt;if there's a good product out there to cover the front walk-thru
&gt;area and the stick-shift area with some kind of material that will
&gt;protect the carpet.  I'd like to get something down before it gets
&gt;too worn.

i've seen a fellow who had some carpet-protector/runners in his van. he got
them from a household carpet place ... they are very thick clear vinyl with
a roughened top surface and little spikes on the bottom (to hold them in
place). unfortunately, the top surface is still a bit slippery if you have
any wetness on the bottom of your feet.

my sister, cheap person that she is, got gawdawful cheap looking carpet
remnants and flung them down in her Biddy-mobile (as her kids call the
chrysler product) ... it does protect the original carpet, and is removeable
for cleaning/replacement, but you have to get the kind with some sort of
rubberized backing (or it slides all over the place).

time for a journey to the Discount Carpet Barn! :)
