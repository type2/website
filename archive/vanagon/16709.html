&gt; I will definately be doing the Bug-out. I have been
&gt; trying to talk my friend (who lives five minutes
&gt; from the motorway) to let me 'borrow' his place
&gt; for a meeting place, etc. Maybe.

We too live a few minutes from the Speedway but there we live in a 
cul-de-sac so parking is very limited.  We might be able to use the roads 
with in a block of us if people are so inclined.
