Subject: Unsgtable Idle

My 83 Water-cooled vanagon suffers from an unstable idle. Any
suggestions out there as to possible causes? I am not very familiar with
the &quot;parts&quot; on this system yet. 

Ignition parts are new, fuel system has had Techron, but it constantly
hunts up and down.

Thanks

DDF
