Subject: Tink,Tink,Tink goes the valve!

Thanks everyone for the replies about the Gas Mileage.  It seems that the
Genius before me replaced 3 plug wires and not the 4th.  I knew it was
missing but I didn't realize that bad.  1 wire was bad and now I have some
REAL power, only problem is, I have a very loud valve tap off the pass
side valves.  Driver side does it too.  I wonder if it is a) a sticky set
of valves, b)bad lifter, c)bad spring d)bad tappet )ebad cam lobe.  Any
ideas and is this common?  Thanks for the help.
