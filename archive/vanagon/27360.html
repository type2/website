Subject: Inspirational VW poem (dedicated to Grendel the Good Condition Van)

hey now,

i was cleaning out some old files and came across this poem, while not directly
related to vws per se, we all ask sometimes when working on the vans, will it
be okay? in any case, it's a good poem and might make someone smile today.
which is the important thing really. so those with major vw projects or
catastrophes...it'll be okay...*hug*

i didn't write this, unfortunately i don't know who did.

 &quot;But what if no one likes the way I dance?&quot;

 &quot;You go dancing in the woods, alone in the crackling leaves.  One day, you meet
 someone else dancing in the woods.  You dance together, you throw leaves at
 each
  other, you lie down in the leaves.  Then you go home and draw pictures,
 and drink cocoa with whipped cream.&quot;

 &quot;But what if a bee stings me?&quot;

  piece of raw onion back and forth                    /      .-~

 &quot;But it does.&quot;                                /     |    \

                __        __         &quot;My love doesn't die, it stays with
              /~ .~\    /~  ~\        you, as warm as two pairs of mittens
             '      `\/'      *       on top of each other.  When you
            (                .*)      remember you and me, you say:

     ( `\/'*)       `\/'            dogs and snakes.  You dance with other
      \   */'                      people in the leaves, and are in plays with
       `\/'                        them. You love them, and they love you, and
                                  you eat raisins together.&quot;

 &quot;So will it be okay?&quot;

 &quot;Yes, my love, it will.&quot;
