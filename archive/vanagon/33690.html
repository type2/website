I met a guy at Manderfield Reservoir in Utah (anybody else know where that
is?  I think I'm probably the only one that ever drove a splittie up
there!), while I was fishing years back.  We weren't catching anything,
while he pulled all kinds of fish (well, trout, actually) out of the water.
As he was leaving, he suggested I try spraying the worms with WD-40.
Didn't have any with me, so I couldn't.

Okay, so it's a tad off topic!
