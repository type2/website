Hello All!

I found it quite amusing when Chrysler trumpeted their &quot;Revolutionary Cab
Forward Design&quot; in a few of their recent (2 years old or so models).  They
looked an awful lot like the NSU Ro80 from the 50s and 60s to me!

&gt;Well....letseee here.....
&gt;They've &quot;invented&quot; the following so far....
&gt;
&gt;-&quot;Ch**sler - We invented the Minivan&quot;   (a.k.a. the sh*tbox)

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;can anybody else think of any more of their &quot;inventions&quot;??
&gt;

I wonder if they have some young guy who wanders around VW junk yards
looking for new things to invent?
