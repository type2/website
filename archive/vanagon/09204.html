Gerry &quot;old fart&quot; Skerbitz querries:

&gt;34 at last. What does that mean?

Lets see...it means that you are almost twice as old as an 18 year
old co-ed...

You are definately twice as old as the oldest jailbait....

You are one year older than my second wife....

If you reversed the digits, you'd be as old as me....

You are half way to retirement age....

In 21 more years, you can get a free cup of coffee on senior citizen's
day at McDonalds....

You are not to be trusted (&quot;Never trust anyone over 30!&quot;)

I guess you can consider yourself an old fart!!

&gt;From an older, but wiser (or is that an old Budweiser) Fart
