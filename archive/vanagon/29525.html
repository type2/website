Subject: Re: rebuild


Hi -- I saw the thread about rebuilding a Type 4 2.0L from
an '82 bus (I think...), and about the head-cracking and
seat-dropping problems.

My engine is also littered across the garage floor, except
the heads which went to Mark Stevens this week.  Cracks
in 3 cylinders, one clear through so it's visible looking in
the exhaust port.  I guess they sold me with the guarantee that
there'd be no chance of a dropped seat -- it's worth the roughly
$100 extra it's costing me to knoow I won't have to pull the engin
apart again soon and replace expensive parts 'cuz some seat
did its statistical best to ruin my day.  Yuck.

The cam went to Weber also somewhere in CA.  The can handle
the crank here in SLC :)

This list is way too busy for me on a daily basis but it's
a great resource at a time like this when I need all the
info I can get.  Thanks!

	Gary
