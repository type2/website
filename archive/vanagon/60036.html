Burping? does your VW also fart? My one runs with a good fart, but fart
means speed i DK. Ho, ho. English-speaking guests always laugh/blush
when they pass through the town of &quot;Middlefart&quot;
Anyway, your suggestion made me aware, that the lid for the reservoir
has a small hole (=D8=3D3millimetres). I suppose some moisture could esca=
pe
through this while driving, but I believe some air has to be able to
enter to compensate for the vacuum made by water sucked into the system.
Do your cars have this little hole in the lid?
