Ok, I read this big long article about oil.  
Now, I have a '71 bus, everything stock.  I live in 
Nebraska, which means it is 100+ on and off for four months and -25 
for four months of the year and anywhere else the rest.  Would anyone 
care to recommend a summer and winter oil for these conditions?  When 
I bought it the previous owner had several quarts of Valvoline All 
Season(?) 10W30, it leaks a lot.  This is what I have been religiously
adding at the rate of a half quart every couple of hundred miles.  
Which leads to another question:  When it leaks this much oil is it 
really necessary to change it very often, or at all?  I don't want to 
start an oil war here.  Just would like some ideas about what other 
people have had luck with driving in these kind of conditions.

Thanks, Jim.
