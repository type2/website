Subject: Re: trying some new timing settings...

&gt;| I have generally set my timing a little bit advanced (I think this is 
&gt;| advanced--mark to the LEFT of the engine seam).  I tried setting the mark at the 
&gt;| seam for a few days and the van seemed be unusually sluggish and the 
&gt;| idle problem was much worse.  I tried setting the timing last weekend 
&gt;| back to the left again, only a bit further.  Idle problems have 
&gt;| completely disappeared--idle is much steadier than even the times 
&gt;| when the condition was less apparent.  The van is noticeably more 
&gt;| powerful--especially on the low end, but also maintains 70 (and even 
&gt;| higher) on the freeway very willingly.

	Do you disconnect the coolant temp sender before timing the engine?
The first time I tried to time the van, I didn't read/remember that I was
supposed to unplug that connection and found the timing notch about 20 degrees
or so to the left on my 2.1L digifant engine. Not sure if this is the same
as on the 1.9 digijet engine (the 85 had the digijet system right?).
