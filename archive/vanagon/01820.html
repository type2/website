&gt;I heard rumors from a few sources that VW was going to be coming
&gt;out with a Winnebago conversion of the Eurovan in June of this
&gt;year.  Has anybody else heard about this?  The first reports
&gt;were that it was going to have a shower and toilet.  That
&gt;got dropped in later rumors.  A swimming pool would be nice.

yup. it's true. ads have started appearing in the motorhome magazines.
there are TWO versions: one for vw, and one for winnebago. the 'bago model
is called the Riata and lists for nearly $40,000. the vw model is called
the Eurovan Camper, and lists for around $30,000. shower and toilet are in
the 'bago model. pool is extra cost option. :)

&gt;I'm willing to chalk it all up to a bad dream.

well ... at least they are trying. :)  i actually got a fold-out poster-
brochure in the mail from winnebago, and someone said they had gotten
some stuff from vw. has anybody seen one on the lot yet? (we don't have
much of a vw dealer here, much less a winnebago dealer).
