&gt;Phone # etc, or distributer for SWEPCO?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Concenus on Porschephiles list was that SWEPCO 201 gear oil is absolutely 
&gt; &gt;the best, from South West Petroleum Co, at $30-45 per gallon, damned 
&gt; &gt;expensive, but lets the synchros and shafts work smoothly.
&gt;

Hi, sorry, I don't have a number, Automotion Inc in California have a 1-800 
that works Canada/USA, which I will post soon. They are not the cheapest 
BTW.   tim
