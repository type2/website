Subject: Tranny Change Time

Well, after a few years of driving my bus without reverse, I'm getting a 
rebuilt one.  Not because of no reverse, but because 3 of the 4 bolts 
that attach the right wheel to the spring plate had broken off.

So I wanted to see if anyone has any insight on what I should fix while 
I have the tranny out.  I plan on doing a fairly complete rebuild of the 
brake system since the rear end is in pieces anyway.  About the only 
thing I don't plan on replacing is the metal lines.  And from Thom's 
experience I'll probably replace the brake springs also.  It looks like 
I'll replace the tranny mounts also.

About the tranny... I plan on using StaLube gear oil for the first 1000 
miles.  Then I'll have to decide on a fluid for the next 30,000 miles.  
It doesn't sound like everyone had great luck with synthetic tranny oil, 
is it worth it, or should I stick with StaLube or Kendall?

Oh, and is the clutch pressure plate one of those things that should be 
changed all the time?

Bradley
