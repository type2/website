Subject: Gas Heat in a Splittie...

This is for Markus and anyone else interested.

I have an early 80's Vanagon gas heater (BA-6) installed in my '65 Deluxe.
Its a flat muffler-looking unit that sits midships under the bus.  The
heat outlet connects directly to the main duct that runs forward to the cab
area of the bus.  The exhaust is vented to the side and slightly back on the
passenger side.  (This exhaust helped me un-freeze my tire pressure gauge
last night).  It draws air from a port under the rear seat/bed such that it
reheats the air from inside the bus.  Also the heat exchangers can be connected
to this system via port to the systems blower motor.
