Subject: Re: [T2] Ponderous motor thoughts...


&gt;&gt; &gt;I saw an ad for a 1.7 L Porsche 914 motor and was wondering if this would
&gt;&gt; &gt;fit in my '79 Bust.

&gt;&gt; (a) You could rebuild yours well for $250.

&gt;Ummm... I think $750 would be a bare minimum to rebuild his engine.
&gt;Probably $9-1200, based on my experience, but I guess it depends on your
&gt;definition of &quot;rebuilt&quot;.  Not counting labor costs, of course, which
&gt;would be &quot;free&quot; if you do it yourself.

I thought his was a Type 2! Why does it say [T2] at the top? Is there
something going on I don't know about again?
