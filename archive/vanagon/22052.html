So A Brandon Smith says:
&gt; kind soul near the portland (or seattle as i am there ofter) area to
&gt; possibly spend an hour (at the most, i promise) pointing a thing or
&gt; two out for me and answer some very simple questions (such as what the
&gt; heck is that thing there on the engine, and now where the heck is that
&gt; located, ...).  i wouldn't ask you to fix anything for me, i just want
&gt; a slight push to get me going.  in return i would be more than willing
&gt; to purchase you a bunch of your favorite beer and feed you something
&gt; delicious.  if someone were willing i would be amazingly appreciative
&gt; and would sing your praises.  anyway, it would be great if someone
&gt; wouldn't mind.

One suggestion I have in figuring out what things are is to buy a 
copy of the Bentley manual for your year van.  The pictures in it
for your model are really excellent and should help to clarify some
of your questions.
