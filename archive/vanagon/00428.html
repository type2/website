Subject: '84 Vanagon water pipe
Date: Tue, 19 Apr 94 16:43:36 EDT


One of the metal engine coolant pipes that cary the coolant the full
length of the vehicle on my '84 Vanagon is leaking.  It is the pipe
that is closest to the passenger side of the vehicle, which way the 
coolant flows in that pipe I have no idea.  The leak is right at the
first bend in the pipe as it leaves the engine compartment and starts
to head towards the front of the van.  I new that this pipe was
leaking before I purchased the vehicle, what I didn't know was that
the part can not be found.  My mechanic has been trying to find the
part for the last two days.  VW is telling him that they can not find
one anywhere in the states.  They claim the part just &quot;never&quot; fails.  
If that is the case then I'm thinking about going to the junk yard for
a used replacement.  Any comments or suggestions?
