Subject: The saggies

My 83.5 has the saggies.  Can anyone help.    The rear-end sit quite a
bit lower than the front of my Westy.  I have assumed this is normal
since so many I have seen seem to be low in the rear end, however I
think the coil springs must be bad.  I have checked the archives to no
avail.  Are the springs the culprit, and how much does it cost for new
springs.  Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks.
