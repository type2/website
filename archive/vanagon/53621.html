&gt;

thanks all for the info on how to find the archives. and i see im not the
only one having trouble accessing it. i had a address to access just not
sure if i was doing something wrong since i have never accessed it in the
past. so its a new thing to me and i wanted to find out how before i said
something is wrong since i wasnt sure if i had incorrectly did something.
any way thanks to all who answered and took the time. and if the archives
or gateway or what ever get back up let me know i still want to check it
out. thanks all 
e- mail me at &lt;strtbug_at_ibm_dot_net&gt; thanks and i do have the archive address
and will use it as soon as i can later Jonce Happy new year!!
