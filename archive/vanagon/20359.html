Subject: Re: transmission front mount

&gt;&gt;I replaced the missing stud and nuts using plenty of locktite. Works
&gt;&gt;great. No more feeling like the bus is going to fall apart.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Anybody else have an experience like this

As a matter of fact yes. My 72 camper came with out the front trans mount.  I
spent $27 at a VW dealer to get the bar and the bolts.  I did not really
notice any difference shifting, but I feel better knowing that it is there.


***THUMP***
What was that?
***wirrrrr wirrrrr, klunk,klunk***
Oh....Just the trans dropping out and taking the engine with it
