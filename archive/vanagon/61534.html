&gt;I do concede that burning plastic does put some nasty stuff into

&gt;to the 2 other things we are doing.  All non-emotional and
&gt;substantiated information especially welcome.  :)

At the last campout, there were a considerable number of young kids around
the fire.  I find myself wondering, do burning plastics generate dangerous
amounts of carcinogens or other poisons for children or adults?  Does
anyone know?  How about our resident fireman?

At least for me, the 'driving a car is just as bad' argument is specious.
I generally don't drive.  (I have a 10 second commute.)  This is how I can
feel okay about driving a fairly gas-thirsty vehicle.
