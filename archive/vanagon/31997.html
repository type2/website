Subject: VW Splittie Ads

ADdicts:

Here in my office I have the following ads for splitties
framed and hanging on the wall:

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Picture:  66ish red/white Deluxe wrapped in a big red ribbon
with a bow on top.

Caption:  It comes in its own box.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Picture: Red/white Deluxe with the side doors and sunroof
open.

Caption:  Do you have the right kind of wife for it?

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

splittie body.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Picture: Red/white Deluxe, sunroof and cargo doors open,
with an elephant standing in the cargo area.

Caption:  You never know when you'll have to take an
elephant someplace.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

And my personal FAVORITE:

Don't tell me, you folks want me to type in all the
text from the ads too, don't you?
