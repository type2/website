Subject: Re: '79 f.i./carb conversion (finally)

&gt;$289.00.  This is a single carb set-up, and I wonder about provisions on 
&gt;this carb for intake air pre-heating--carburator icing can be, ah, 
&gt;inconvenient.
&gt;
I've had 3 setups on the '73 Campmobile - stock (dual solex 1bbl), weber 
progressive, and dual del ortos (basically 4 single barrel carbs with shared 
bowls).

There was a definite increase in power when I converted to the weber.  There 
was, however also a definite loss of cold weather driveability - carb icing, 
and no preheat air really messed things up.

I have very good cold weather driveability (it's all relative - keep in mind 
I live near Dallas, Texas) with the Dels.  They have no choke.  To start up, 
the instructions just recommend a blip with the throttle to keep it running 
(accelerator pump).  This is for 60 seconds or less.  Carb icing is not a 
problem either - there is no preheat, but with one barrel per cylinder, the 
air is moving through the venturi much slower, expanding and cooling less.  
I suppose the flip side to this is that the slower air speed might not allow 
full atomization of the fuel, with a corresponding loss of efficiency.  My 
mpg is the worst with this setup, but I've accepted that penalty for the 
excellent power.  Not sure I'd do it again.  I'd re-evaluate the mileage and 
additional hardware cost vs the power  increase - I mean, I'm not building a 
hot rod here.
