&gt;HEY!!! How about splitting up the Washingtonians?
&gt;There's a much more major difference between W. WA (rain forests,etc.)
&gt;and E. WA (Desert, mostly, IMHO.) :^)

ok, i tell you guys what: any state/province with more than 20 folks can
get split into north-south, east-west, rich-poor, us-them ... but you got
to have 20 or more. :)
