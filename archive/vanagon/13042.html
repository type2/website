&gt;So Christopher Bridge says:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Well, my motor is back in, but I can't get it to run well.  I set the timing 
&gt;&gt; at notch, I think 7 degrees after TDC, and here the engine had a hard time 
&gt;
&gt;It's suppose to be 7 and 1/2 degrees BEFORE TDC (static)!!!!
&gt;
&gt;&gt; starting, and seems to be running hot.  The brand new extractor system 
&gt;&gt; already has all it's paint burned off.  I'm coming from a real disadvantage 
&gt;
&gt;With the distributor advanced that far, I'm not suprised it was getting so
&gt;hot.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1) 1600 dp with a 009 and 34-pict-3 carb.  The crank pulley has a TDC mark, 
&gt;     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;This is was told me where the timing should be.

I readjusted it to 7.5 _BTDC_. Runs real well at speed, but still will not 
idle worth a *$%^$.  Running real cool as well.  I don't know why the 
manuals say _ATDC_ for the timing.  Muir said that on his 71, with a 009, he 
timed it at 7.5 but it doesn't say wether it is BTDC or after.  Didn't I 
have it retarded to far, that is a later spark, or do I have my nomenclature 
mixed up?  Does anyone want to tell me about the Carb or am I on my own there?

Thanks for your help.
