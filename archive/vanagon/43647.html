Subject: Re: In search of '86 Vanagon Air Cond. compressor. 

&gt; I need to replace the AC compressor on my '86.  It is made by Sanden and is
&gt; a SD510.  Problem is the local VW dealer quoted me $603 (!!) and another
&gt; $150 (!) for the new reciever dryer!  This seems excessive - but none of the
&gt; local parts sources can get me this compressor from the aftermarket.  
&gt; I would be willing to modify the system if needed to fit a cheaper
&gt; compressor - can anyone suggest (1) a source for a cheaper OE compressor, or
&gt; (2) a cheaper alternate compressor that will fit the existing bracket.
&gt; Thanks in advance!

Mike,

I had to buy one of these for my 85 about a year ago.  I think I paid 
a little less than $200 (can't remember exactly because I had to have 
several other things done and it was all part of a $500 bill)  
Anyway, try my guy at:

European Cooler Air
Jerry West
214-771-3791

He specializes in VW and other european automobile A/C systems.  He 
sells complete fabricated systems for beetles and buses too!  Nice 
guy and he has been fair w/ me.
