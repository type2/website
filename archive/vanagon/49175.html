Subject: EV - Help Tire Needed!

Does anyone have an used Goodyear G64 that they are willing to part with.

My spare is bald and one of the tires I'm running on is out of round.  
Usable but bad.  The word at Goodyear is that they are waiting on the 
factory in Britan to produce some, there are none in the US, the expected 
backorder is 30-60 days and the list price is $178.00 each.

Any ideas or sources would be greatly appreciated.  

Thanks,
Trace Choulat
