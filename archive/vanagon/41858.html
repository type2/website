Subject: Engine Questions

Okay so let me get this out of the way right now... this is my first time.

I just got my GEX engine.  I have all of the accessories from the engine I
used to have.  NOW what should I do.  I noticed that there was a little tag
near the distriributor mount which said &quot;Do not rotate engine until dist is
installed&quot;

Why?

Is it becvause it has been set at TDC?  DFoes this mean I could set the
pulley wheel correctly as well?

All help will be greatly appreciated!

Also want to thank the NUMEROUS people who helped me on the window install
- it was the lack of lubricant which made it so difficult.  (hmm, sounds
very bad.. :-)
