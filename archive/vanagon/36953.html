hey, just found a 68 upright rust free, 7 pass bus in upstate ny...geneseo to

exact..it's listed on the vw archive, the guy wants 3k for it, but swears upside down
 and backwards that there is no rust/cali vehicle . he says it runs strong

but the guy he bought it from plopped a 72 bug engine in it, so it's a little sketchy...and there is no rubber around the doors!! go figure!! jim
