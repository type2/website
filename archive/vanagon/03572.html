Subject: RE: HELP! Need a Seattle mechanic!

My VW nut (Rabbit, Scirocco &amp; Quantum Syncro) brother-in-law recommended
that I take my '87 Syncro to a place called Redmond Werkshop, out by
Marymore park.

Having been in twice now, I have nothing but good things to say about the
service. They seem very knowledgeable, are very friendly (not arrogant like
many specialty shops), and actually seemed concerned about the welfare of
my vechicle. In both instances, several little items were
fixed/tweaked/adjusted without my asking at no charge. And on the whole,
they don't seem too teribly pricey.

The number is (206) 885-7677. The proprietor is Cub Nelson and Michael is
his partner.

Feel free to say that I sent ya'.

Paul
