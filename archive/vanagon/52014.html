Subject: Front outer CV on Syncro

Looking through the archives, I see a few people have at least attempted this
job and after looking through the Bentley manual, I still have questions
on whether this is something I can do, or something I can start and then
have to get the beast towed to my mechanic to finish ;)

	So, looking through the manual, I cannot tell if I have to remove the
whole wheel bearing assembly, or can I drop the inner CV joint and then
remove the large axle bolt, and just pull the whole axle shaft out. My
mechanic, says this job is a very large pain and that I will need a lift to
suspend the front end while I am doing this. He also says I will need a
press, which I assume is for the splash ring and oil seal - does this come as
part of a new outer joint? I cannot tell how these three parts (cv,
splash ring, and oil seal go together from the picture and do not want to
wait til everything is apart to figure it out).

	So, do I have the above correct in thinking I can pull the joint
out of the hub without removing the wheel bearing assembly? Can I in fact,
just block the wheel, and use my torque wrench (not sure if it will do 350 Nm)
and a breaker bar to pull that nut off (and put it back on later), and then
slide the joint out all nice and neat? Or do I have this wrong and it is much
more involved...
