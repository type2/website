Subject: Re: Using some list post in Limbo newsletter

 &gt; To who it may concern,
 &gt;     I'm writting you to ask if I might be able to use some of the posts I
 &gt; recieve from the 'Vanagon List' In the LiMBO newsletter. 

I would STRONGLY recommend that you query the author for EACH post you use in 
your newsletter.  I am AGAINST any blanket permission.  I OBJECT to the list 
owner transfering MY copyright to anyone.

I for one don't want my appearance in a newsletter to be a surprise.  I think 
querying the author of a list posting first is the minimally acceptable 
courtesy; offering a free copy of the issue with the posting in it is quite 
nice.  I've gotten some interesting newsletters that way.

That said, I almost ALWAYS grant permission to anyone foolish enough to want 
to use one of my silly postings in a newsletter.  (It does happen, but usually 
on the Britcar lists where I'm more active.)  Whenever I refuse it's to make 
it into a better article first.
