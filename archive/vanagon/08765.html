David &quot;probably never seen a wild turkey&quot; Carment replied:
&gt;Yeah, the turkey's are very insulted. Actually, Turkey's are so dumb that
&gt;they will drown themselves looking skyward during a rain storm.....dc

well ... them really dumb turkeys are the white domesticated farm-raised
birds. and they really are that stupid. but, see, they had to have all the
smarts bred out ... otherwise, they'd fly the coop. ;)

the wild birds are quite another matter: very very smart and able to avoid
most hunters. and, believe it or not, they can fly pretty damn good. but
you really have to see it, to believe it. :)  in fact, old Benjamin Franklin
was so impressed with the bird that he tried to have it (wild turkey) as the
national bird of the u.s. (rather than a carrion-eater like the eagle). alas,
the looks of the turkey lost it the contest: too much like the buzzard (which
is sometimes called the &quot;turkey buzzard&quot; because of the resemblance. :)
