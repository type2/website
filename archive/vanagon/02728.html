&gt; Traveling through Santa Cruz, California last week, I had my first 
&gt; opportunity to look inside a 1995 Eurvan &quot;camper&quot; model with all the 
&gt; gear, poptop, etc.

&gt; One big difference seems to be a different model of refrigerator, made by 
&gt; Norcold as I recall. Given all the trouble with the former frig., should 
&gt; this one be more reliable?  Cooler?

Hmmm... I thought the only camper option available in the US was the
&quot;weekender&quot;, which has a small wannabe-fridge under one of the seats.
It's not a true fridge, but one of those thermostatic or whatever thingies
that only cools 40 degrees below the outside air temp.  So if it is
90 degrees inside your camper your food will spoil :(

Norcold is, at least, a good brand of refrigerator.  Mine is original in the
camper, and at 21 years old, still freezes stuff.
