&gt; 
&gt; I've read a few msgs off this list recently which made mention of an entity
&gt; called 'Berg'.  Confusing thing is, Berg has been referred to as 'Berg says
&gt; this' and also 'Berg has this' - is Berg a manual, a shop, a parts house, a
&gt; real person, or what?
&gt; 

Berg is all these things.  He started out as a person, and went from there.
Look in any of the supermarket VW rags, and he usually has a full-page ad
within the first 10 pages.  He's also known as Gene Berg.  Famous for
hopping up air-cooleds, and using mucho dinero to do so.
