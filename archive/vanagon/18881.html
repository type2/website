Subject: My van won't start - any help?

Howdy-

Here is what I believe to be a stumper.  My girlfriend took our van to 
Colorado, and it now will not start.  She has done many tests, and 
eliminated a lot of possibilies.  Here are some facts:

-It is a '76 2.0 FI with about 90 K miles on it
-I rebuilt the engine only about 2500 miles ago.  As an ametuer,  Icould 
have something wrong
-She found a short by noticing a spark when she re-installed the battery 
(after cleaning the connections).  She isolated it to the fuse circuit 
that controls the flashers and buzzers, I believe.  She has removed the 
fuse and recharged the battery.
-It will not push start.  If I am right, that eliminates the starter, 
solenoid, etc.
-She is getting sparks at the spark plug wires
-She is probably getting fuel, because after several tries it smells like 
gas.

I was just on the phone with her, and recommended that she finish all 
tests before going to a mechanic.  I told her to:
-pull a fuel injector or two and test it
-examine the spark plugs
-do a compression test

Any other recommended tests?  What is left as a possibily?
