&gt;&gt;&gt; Then the guy who puts the JATO unit on the Nova (at least they didn't 
ask
&gt;&gt;&gt; for money)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;You must admit, that was a rather good story!
&gt;
&gt;Yea, but does Kennedy Engineering make an adapter for the bus?

Yes, they do, and it is one of their most successful conversions. Not one
purchaser has filed a complaint after trying it!


&gt;And what is the effect on your reduction boxes?

Don't worry about them-- you won't be able to find a thing wrong with them
after the first test run.
