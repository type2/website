Called Camping World.
The model is a Catalina 2500.
There is no such animal as a 2000.

Requires measurements:
Sizes available are: 8'2&quot; _at_ $299
and 9'10&quot; _at_ $339.

Mounts directly to rain gutter.

&gt;My awning is the Dometic Catalina 2500.  It is a gutter mount that goes
&gt;from the back of the van to the front of the sliding door.   Extends
&gt;about 8 feet and has small plastic pole holders mounted on the side of
&gt;the van.  So when it is set up it is completely free standing. I can
&gt;move the van for optimum shade without taking the awning down.  I
&gt;wouldn't live without it!  Not sure what the 2000 model mentioned in
&gt;this thread is like but I sure like mine.  Set up and take down is a
&gt;breeze once you learn the tricks.
