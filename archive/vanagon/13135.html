You won't find many dealers willing to touch that
auxilary diesel fed gas heater found in diesel
Vanagons but those thing were ridiculousy rare
anyway.  The few regular gas heater repair firms
in the US might service it if you reall wanted, but
hey you got more heat than an air cooled already
quit worrying.
