Subject: RE: seatbelts + airbags



&gt;&gt; My dad's '60 Sunbeam Alpine came from the factory with seat belts.
&gt;&gt; So did his '63 Ford Falcon van.
&gt;
&gt;That's weird, my sister's '65 Mustang doesn't have any seat belts.


Neither did my '66 Mustang when I bought it a few years ago, probably
from about the 20th previous owner &lt;g&gt;. (My family was original owner
of the Sunbeam and the Ford van). But the Mustang did have holes for the
seat belt bolts, which were empty and open to the road under the car. I
don't know if the Mustang had seat belts in these holes when the car was
new. I put belts in after I bought it.

My '71 bus had a lap and shoulder belt for the driver, and a lap belt
only for the two other front-seat passengers (it's the only full-cabin
bay-window non-walk-thru in captivity I believe). There were no belts
for any of the rear seats, though both rear seats were in the car and
seemed to match. There were holes in the floor for all seat belts, and
I put in five sets of lap belts. They needed strange size metric bolt
that I'd never seen on a VW before-- $3.50 each at a VW dealer. NOBODY
else had these bolts.
