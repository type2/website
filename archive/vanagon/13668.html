Subject:       VW Ignition Coils

Import Service, Sept '90, Vol 3, No 9

&quot;Coil tower and coil wire burnout problems on '85 and later VWs may 
be caused by ignition coils with black part number labels.  Symptoms 
of this problem are hard starting, poor performance, or a no-start 
condition.  Replace damaged VW and Audi black label coils with 
updated green label coils, P/N 211 905 115 D.  Make sure the engine 
also has non-resistor ignition wires and spark plugs installed to 
prevent future coil tower and coil wire burnout.&quot;

Dan's Note:
'non-resistor wires' i assume means the standard OEM type that are 
solid copper with the resistor on the END.
