   Did you use DOT 4 Brake fluid?

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I hope someone can help me because I'm at the end of my rope. I noticed
&gt; the other day that there was considerable wetness on the back of the brake
&gt; back plate on my 83 westy. I took it apart and sure enough the inside was
&gt; soaked with brake fluid and caked on brake dust. I got new shoes and new
&gt; wheel cylinders from a FLAPS. I put them on per bentley. I bleed the
&gt; brakes and the clutch 4 times and I still cannot find the source of the
&gt; problem. I bleed the brakes as described in the bentley but I do not see a
&gt; lever on the brake pressure regulator. Does anyone have any ideas? The
&gt; pedal just doesn't get firm. I replaced the brake master cylinder and the
&gt; clutch master and slave cylinders a couple of months ago. After I bleed
&gt; the brakes the pedal is still mushy. I bleed again and air comes out on
&gt; the first pump only for each wheel. The front bottoms seem to have air
&gt; come out for about 5 or 6 pumps. I think I'm done and the pedal still
&gt; feels weak and goes about 3-4 inches from the floor. The clutch works but
&gt; the
&gt; pedal is soft. I checked for fluid leaks and could find none. I checked
&gt; everything that I did and checked the bentley a zillion times. My bleeding
&gt; partner said the pedal would feel firm and the get mushy. I don't know
&gt; what else to do. Does anyone have any ideas? Thanks in advance for any
&gt; suggestions.
