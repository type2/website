Subject:      Misc parts needed and other questions

We are relatively new Westfalia owners and have a lot of miscelaneous
questions.

1. We need to find a good source for inexpensive, aftermarket parts for t=
he
camper.  In particular we're looking for a replacement window screen for
the sliding door that costs less than the $50 Volkswagon price, a new
plastic vent for the fiberglass top (the one that lifts with the roller
mechanism) that's less than the $150 VW price, and if possible a new flip=

down steel cover for the burners (the one that came on the US Westfalia
version and acts as a drain into the sink).
2. We've heard there is someone who makes a snap-on screen that covers th=
e
entire sliding door space.  Does someone know the name, address, and phon=
e
no. of this person or company?
3. We plan to live in the VW in the winters and store it in the summers
while we travel around on bicycle.  Therefore, it will be sitting for up =
to 6
months at a time.  Is there anything special we should do to prevent havi=
ng
any engine, a/c, or other troubles when we restart it after sitting so
long?
4. We want to ship it to Europe for a multiyear tourist trip.  We will no=
t
be working.  We would like to retain registration in the U.S as we hear
this is easier than registering in Europe.  Is this possible?  Are there
unusual problems we may encounter with import paperwork, required equipme=
nt
modifications, insurance, etc?  Is there one country that is a better pla=
ce
to ship it than any other?  Will we have any difficulty with the propane
tank; i.e. are the fill valves common between Europe and the US?  Should =
we
consider having the catalytic converter removed so we can take it into an=
y
country where perhaps unleaded gas is hard to find?
5. What happens if the water in the camper tank freezes?  Should we keep
that tank empty in winter?
6. Being relatively short and having zero upper body strength I find I
cannot lift the top without help.  Has anyone ever tried adding hydraulic=
 =

lifters to make it easier?  Any other suggestions?
7. We find in real hot weather the fridge does just a so-so job.  Forget
making any ice cubes, we're lucky to see 55 to 60 deg F.  Could there be
something wrong or is that just the way it works?
8. Is there any company that publishes a good repair and maintenance =

manual for the water cooled Vanagons?  We have the factory repair and
service manual, the big green one.  But it's not very good.  We'd sure
like to find something like a Chilton's with detailed step-by-step
instructions.
9. Is there a maintenance list somewhere?  The kind that says after each =

10,000 miles you do this, each 20,000 do that, etc?

Please reply to world_cyclists_at_compuserve_dot_com as I cannot access the mail=
 =

list directly at this time.

Thanks for the help
