Subject: 73 Bus Floorplan?


A friend of mine has recently purchased a 1973 bus with a non-Westfalia 
pop top and a very cheesy interior.  He pulled the bed (made of 2x4s) out 
and we went to Austin VeeDub Salvage and bought a Westy bed for $100.

What he wants to do now is put in custom cabinets.  Does anyone know 
where we could get an acurate floor plan for this bus?  We could measure 
and draw one out but if someone has already done this, why reinvent the 
wheel?
                                Thanks,
