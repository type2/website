&gt; What makes you think that they're reinforced?  40 psi usually means non
&gt;reinforced.  Maybe they are but that is a curious max psi.

  And then Joel Walker riposted:

&gt;not so fast there, tire-breath! :)  my Michelin XZX's are definitely
&gt;reinforced sidewalls and they also have a max psi of 40.

   I'll have to ditto Joel;  I'm running Reinforced Michelin MXL's, load rated
at 1580 lbs at a maximum pressure of 40psi.
