Subject: Re: Syncro Westy found! But...

hey tom:

can't offer you much more info on your questions, but i think that the
newer the car, the higher the $$ on duty. where is the car located in
canada? what kind of shape is the body in? if it is located in toronto, i
could always drop by and take a look at it. let me know



&gt;     OK, in less than 24 hours since my possting, I have my first lead. But
&gt;     three questions:
&gt;
&gt;     1. This is an 87 with 110,000 miles, original engine. What are
&gt;     experiences with engine life. In my '63 Type II I figured a new
&gt;     engine every 60,000 miles.
&gt;
&gt;     2. Unit does not have A/C. I live in very sweaty, disgustingly
&gt;     hot and humid Washinton DC. How difficult would a retrofit
&gt;     be, (hopefully with junkyard parts)? Would I need A/C from a Westy, or
&gt;     any Vanagon? Worth the effort?
&gt;
&gt;     3. Its a Canadian vehicle. Any experience with importing into
&gt;     the U.S? I know the duty is 2.5%, and the seller maintains that
&gt;     an 87 will meet &quot;U.S. requirements&quot;, whatever that means, presumably
&gt;     EPA and DOT. I am checking this out with the government agencies
&gt;     myself, but wonder if any of you have gone down this path before...?
&gt;
&gt;     Thanks.
