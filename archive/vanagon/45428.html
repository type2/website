Subject: '80 intermittent misfiring getting worse

If any of you can help, I'd sure appreciate it...

The problem is that the engine misfires intermittently (but 
increasingly more frequently).  This happens at any speed, any gear.  
What has been done so far:
      -new cap and rotor
      -fuel filter
      -air filter
      -plugs and wires 
      -O2 senser okay
      -timing set
      -all wiring and connections checked and secured
The other day, it would not continue running...it would start, then 
immediately stop.  Then it would not even start.  At one point, it
 backfired, not a loud bang but a &quot;poof&quot;.  After disconnected the wiring 
harness from the air box (I think that's what it is near the filter housing) 
and then replacing it a few minutes later, it started up right away, ran like 
a good thing solidly for about an hour.  The next day, I drove it again and
 after about an hour, it started to miss again and got progressively worse.  
When the O2 senser is disconnected, it runs.  When the temperature senser is 
disconnected, it will not start. 
  
At this point, I don't have a manual, but one is on it's way to me, 
so I'm really piddling in the dark.  It doesn't seem to matter how it 
is driven...easy or hard acceleration...it still misses BUT NOT ALL 
THE TIME!!  Sorry for the yelling...I just had to do that!

Anyway, I posted about this problem earlier and had some responses 
but so far nothing seems to work so I'm open to ideas again.  Time is 
getting to be of the essence here, as we are leaving the Toronto area 
on July 11th for the trip to Inuvik, so this problem must be solveed. 

Thanks, guys...
