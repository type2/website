Subject: Re: FTC, VWOA, Head gasket problem

So far I have only seen a few postings in respond to my upcoming battle
with VWoA regarding my westy's head gasket problem. I am wondering where
those vanagons' owners, who had such problems, are. Or am I mistaken that
there are actually very few vanagons suffering from this problem? Am I
just one of very few unfortunate vanagon owners?

My BBB Autoline forms are due in this weekend. Would you please vanagon
owners who have/had the gasket problems send me a short mail describing
your vanagon's model/year and at which age/mileage the gasket problem
occured/repaired? I'll need them to come up a percentage of list members
who have/had the problem. 

I am trying to see how many of us have/had the problem to support the
point that it is indeed a VW's engineering defect. Please support me if
you do/did have the gasket problem. If I don't have this support my winning
(so are yours in the future) chance will be significantly lowered.

Thanks.
