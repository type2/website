&gt;You live in California. Which has probably the strictest emission laws in

&gt;that those emission control laws are not working too well.

The smog may not be gone and it may never be, but it's a LOT less smoggy than
it used to be.  We have only about 20% of the smog alerts that we did 20-25
years ago.  I remember as a kid, around 1970 or so, many summer afternoons
when I couldn't take a deep breath without feeling the pain in my lungs, and
having the smog so thick it would sting your eyes.  Now, I can still see the
smog but I very rarely FEEL it anymore.

Getting my Vanagon smog-checked every 2 years is kind of a pain, but if the
alternative is feeling the sting of smog in my eyes, I'll opt for the smog
laws.
