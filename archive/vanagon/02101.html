Hi again,
	I have plotted the locations of the 21 people that have expressed
interest in this trip.  While I realize that it is not necessary (or possibly
even desirable) to go through everyone's home town, I thought it would be
a good place to start.  It did produce some interesting results...

The &quot;best fit&quot; curve turned out to be a huge &quot;S&quot; shape, lying on its side
(inside out) across the US.  The starting point is in Arizona (Grand
Canyon?) and goes West to Los Angeles, then up through Calif, Oregon, Wash,
to Vancouver, BC, then down to Montana (possibly through Calgary??),
South Dakota (Badlands?), Nebraska, Missouri, Tennessee, Alabama, then up
the East coast, through upstate NewYork and ending at Ottawa.  Presumably,
the tour could complete a figure eight by cutting back down to the South-
West (hitting points missed?) back to Arizona or Southern Calif.

Now that I think about it, a figure eight pattern might lend itself better
to people jumping in and out.  The whole trip might take a really, really
long time though.  What do you all think?  I'm beginning to think that it
will begin in mid-May and go for 8 weeks or more.  Would *anyone* be able
to do the whole thing?  I know I wouldn't.  I could see myself dropping out
near the middle.

Watch for Martha and David's *big questionaire*, which will be posted to
this list sometime Thursday!  Read it over!  Send it in!  It's the trendy
thing to do!  :)
