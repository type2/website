Vanagon, who said anything about one of those new-fangled contrapshins! I
got me one of dem dare microbusssess. Why in *my* day, we wouldn't
da-reeeam of such luxuries. Give me 4 cylinders and God's own air to cool
them with any day. Horsepower! Flibble-dee-floob! whooo needs it. Didn't
have no *Aye-Cee*, no fancy gasoline heater, nope. Didn't want 'em neither.
Spit would freeze in our mouths in the winter and we'd boil alive in our
own skins on the first spring day, AND WE LIKED IT THAT WAY!!!

Kudos to Dana Carvey...
