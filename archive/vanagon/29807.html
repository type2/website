Subject: 1986+ Vanagon Dynamic Oil System???

Vanatics,
Can anyone describe the proper operation of the Dynamic Oil Pressure
Monitoring System found in 1986 &amp; newer Vanagons?

What conditions make the oil light be off?
What conditions make the oil light come on steady?
What conditions make the oil light come on blinking?
What conditions make the buzzer light come on?

Any help is very much appreciated.
