&gt;&gt;I have to go to a conference in Chicago this Wed thru Sat. Is it
&gt;&gt;worth a side trip to JC Whipme?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Also are there any decent Hobby/Model shops in the downtown area?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Howabout VW accessory type places?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Suggestions?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Ric
&gt;&gt;

on he few occasions that i have visited JC Whitney in the flesh,  it has
turned out to be quite the pandemonious place.  The neighborhood is less
than desirable and there is not much to see inside the place anyway with
exception to the antique cars that they have on diplay.  hobby shops...not
sure.  but if you venture out to the suburbs.. thats another story.  in
Addison Il.just off the highway(I-355 south, Lake street exit) there is a
place called Spencer's Home for Battered Bugs, or just plain Battered Bugs
to the regulars.  There you'll find not a junkyard that you can peruse but
Jeff Spencer does have a lot of hard to find items and is just a nice Guy to
talk to.  Nice bunch of guys.
