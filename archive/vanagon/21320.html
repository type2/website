Subject: Need table and handles

I have a '78 Westfalia that is mostly restored. I've searched the Columbus
(OH) area and cannot find these parts:  the primary table and pedital, about
8 or 10 cabinet handles,  and the small stool (with green plaid top.    

  If anyone could help me locate these parts I would greatly appreciate it.
